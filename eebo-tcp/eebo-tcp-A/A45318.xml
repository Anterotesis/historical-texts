            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

who cannot indure innocency it ſelf, when ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in a <hi>Rochet.</hi> We remember what <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith (and it is in his <hi>De Ira</hi> too) they are <hi>affecti oculi, quos candida veſtis obturbat,</hi> happy is it for him, that the blackeſt <hi>Stigma</hi> that can be faſtned upon him, is that his robes were whiter then his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns, that only the coat of our <hi>Joſeph</hi> hath drawn their envy upon him, the Man Dr. <hi>Hall</hi> was not the object of their diſtaſt, but the <hi>Biſhop.</hi> To ſatisfy theſe tender eyes, they have here this great <hi>Aaron</hi> stripped of all his Prieſtly Ornaments, and laid open to them, only in theſe few winding ſheets, ſpunne, and woven, with his own hand. In the narrative of his life, his pen breaks off with his outward preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, wherein all the Loſſes and indignities he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered did ſo little trouble him, as to ſome eminent Commiſſioners (who deſired to know his ſuffering condition, and made fair overtures of ſome little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration) he replyed that of <hi>Seneca, Qui ſe habet, nihil perdidit.</hi> God had no ſooner withdrawn his hand from viſiting him with thoſe outward tryals, then he began to exerciſe him, by ſore afflictions of the body, in his continually increaſing paines of the stone and strangury, which for many years held him, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued him to the death, yet could not theſe great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments take him off from being active, both in Preſſe and Pulpit: His intellectuals and ſences continued ſtrong, and freſh to the last, his head con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Gold, and his heart of refined Silver, when all the reſt of his body was half clay.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:97700:3"/>His ſence of the ſad, and divided condition of the Church, was to his end paſſionatly tender, profeſſing all willingneſs to live, though in the midſt of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding pains and torments, ſo he might be any way inſtrumental to the making up of the breaches of it, and putting it in due frame and order; But ſince all his endeavours with men ſo little prevailed, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceaſed wreſtling with God to this purpoſe, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting apart one day in every weak through the Year, for faſting and humiliation with his Family, not that he ſought his own Intereſts, to be reſtored to that Epiſcopal height, and greatneſs of which he had been diveſted: All thoſe who truely knew him, can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with us, his abundant contentment in his retreat to a private life, as not a miſery, but a bleſſing to him, We know, when in the height of all his honors he was ready enough to ſuch a ſeceſſion, could he fairly, and handſomly have retired. And now that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous ſtorme, which beat him off from the courſe of his publick employments, though it batter'd his veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and tore his ſailes; yet it did but drive him to the quiet haven where he would be; justly could he take up the words of holy <hi>Nazianzen</hi> (in this and many other things his parallel) who when hotly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and thruſt from his See of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> could ſay, A retired life, everwas, and now is dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected by me, though they drive me from my chair, they cannot drive me from my God.</p>

to the Miniſtry from his hands, we cannot but men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one, in whome he take great comfort, as being a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table precedent for the reſt of our learned, &amp; religious Gentry to follow; It was Mr. <hi>Gipſon Lucas,</hi> an <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of good eſtate, a great Commiſſioner, and Juſtice of Peace in the County of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> who found his Spirit and Conſcience ſo wrought upon, as after good deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, and conſultation with others, he came to this Reverend Father for Ordination, as refuſing to take it from any hands, where his did not precede, which he received, (good proof being given of his abilities) according to his deſire, and he who entred <hi>Nayoth</hi> before this aged <hi>Samuel,</hi> like <hi>Saul</hi> in his ſcarlet (for that was his habit) returned from him a Sackcloth Prophet, continuing a diligent and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous preacher of the Goſpel. To returne to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend <hi>Author;</hi> his retreat from the World though he were hotly, and conſtantly charged with furious onſets of his ſharp diſeaſes, yet was it anſwerable to his life, ſolemn, and staid, with a compoſed, and heavenly temper of ſpirit. The ſtream was deep, which could run clear &amp; calmly, through ſo craggy &amp; crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Channel, without a murmure. After his prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infirmities had waſted all the ſtrengths of nature, and the Arts of his learned and excellent Phyſician <hi>D. Brown</hi> of <hi>Norwich</hi> (to whom under God, we and the whole Church are ingaged for many Years preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his life as a bleſſing to us) after his Fatherly reception of many perſons of Honour, Learning and
<pb facs="tcp:97700:4"/>
Piety, who came to crave his dyeing prayers and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction: One of which (A Noble perſon) he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with the words of an ancient Votary, <hi>Vides hominem mox pulverem futurum,</hi> after many holy prayers, exhortations, and diſcourſes, he rouzed up his dying Spirits, to a heavenly Confeſſion of his Faith, which ere he could finiſh, his ſpeech was taken from him, ſo that, we cannot here inſert it. After ſome struglings of nature, with the agonies of death, he quietly, gradually, and even inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly gave up his laſt breath.</p>
                  <p>And now, how can we forbear to cry ſadly after him, <hi>O our Father, our Father, the Chariots of Iſrael, and the Horſemen thereof. Theodorets</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation over <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> may be taken up over Him, <gap reason="foreign">

We pretend not to have gathered up all the Fragments of his choice Proviſions that nothing might be loſt, we know and bewail the loſs, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage of many pretious and moſt important Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and can only labour to forget them, as the Owners of the rich Treaſures buried in the bottom of the Sea must do. Theſe which we have preſerved,
<pb facs="tcp:97700:6"/>
do exhibit, if thou haſt been converſant with his other Works (as who hath not) thou wilt attest them genuine.</p>
                  <p>That Tract of his, The <hi>Via media</hi> mentioned by himſelf (written after his return from the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi>) he made account was buried in perpetual ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; his tenderneſs of the Miſconſtruction of ſome who would cry it down for the very deſigne of it, and his Obedience to the Royal Edict (which inhibited the medling in thoſe Controverſies) eaſily prevailing with him to ſuppreſs it. But what? Should we let it lye by the walls, till ſome other falſe, obtruded Copie do inforce us to bring it forth, for the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it ſelf? Or ſhould we be ſo acceſſary to the unhappineſs of the Church of God, as to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it from her, in this Age eſpecially, which hath revived and blown up again thoſe almoſt dead Coals of Controverſie, the dangerous heat whereof did occaſion that Synod. If the eager Defendants of each ſide ſhall proceed (as yet they do) will it not be bitterneſs in the latter end? Is it not needful that ſome judicious Moderator ſhould interpoſe, and make them ſee, that the Reciprocation of this Saw, doth but divide what might be one entire peece, and make duſt in doing it? Is it not good ſober Counſel, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade each part (after ſo many paſſes made already) to draw breath, and conſider what they do? <hi>Bella geri placuit nullos habitura triumphos.</hi> That their true Gallantry is not in re-inforcing what makes

them Oppoſites, But how without any loſs of neceſſary Truth, both may ſit down ſatisfied; as happy is in theſe differences we may ſay, Is not the whole land before us? There is room enough for both to walk ſafely, and there is no neceſſity of parting or going aſunder. This Reverend Authour ſhews a middle way, wherein both may walk as Friends, the path being broad enough, and the way good, (the buſhes and bryers of needleſs ſubtilties being wiſely avoided.) For this diſcovery all good and ſober men will bleſs the Memory of this Authour. And if he ſhall ſuffer in the Opinion of hotter heads, as too lukewarm and temperate, yea as a cloſe Abetter of <hi>Arminianiſme,</hi> becauſe he hears it ſpeak, and doth not ſpit Fire and Brimſtone upon it, we enter this proteſtation; He was no <hi>Remonſtrant,</hi> but againſt the Monster <hi>Smectymnuus.</hi> And let any obſerving Reader judge, what doth he more then propoſe the <hi>Theſes</hi> of the Remonſtrant Opponents, and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Defendants, ſhewing by collation of what is written by both, how they meet, and differ, how alſo thoſe differences are stated, and arbitrated by Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and Learned Biſhop <hi>Overall</hi> on one ſide, and our Divines on the other. As for this Authour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to prevent thy hard cenſure of his leaning to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius,</hi> we referre thee to the paſſages which thou wilt meet with, wherein he claims the liberty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving his own Judgement, and more eſpecially to <hi>pag. 387.</hi> where in the cloſe of the Tract his unby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſedneſs

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97700:10"/>
but ſilence and forgetfulneſs; but what God hath done for me, is worthy of everlaſting and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Memory.</p>
                  <p>I was born <hi>Julii</hi> 1. 1574. at five of the clock in the Morning, in <hi>Briſtow-Park,</hi> within the Pariſh of <hi>Aſhby de la Zouch,</hi> a Town in <hi>Leiceſter-ſhire,</hi> of honeſt and well allowed Parentage: my Father was an Officer under that truly Honourable and Religious, <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> Preſident of the North, and under him had the Government of that Market-Town, wherein the chief Seat of that Earldome is placed; My Mother <hi>Winifride,</hi> of the Houſe of the <hi>Bambridges,</hi> was a woman of that rare Sanctity, that (were it not for my Intereſt in Nature,) I durſt ſay, that neither <hi>Aleth,</hi> the mother of that juſt Honour of <hi>Clareval</hi>; nor <hi>Monica,</hi> nor any other of thoſe pious Matrons, antiently famous for Devotion, need to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain her admittance to compariſon; She was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exerciſed with the affliction of a weak Body, and oft of a wounded Spirit, the Agonies whereof, as ſhe would oft recount with much paſſion; profeſſing that the greateſt bodily ſickneſſes were but Flea-bites to thoſe Scorpions, ſo from them all, at laſt ſhe found an happy and comfortable deliverance, and that not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a more then ordinary hand of God; For on a time being in great diſtreſs of Conſcience, ſhe thought in her Dream, there ſtood by her a grave Perſonage, in the Gown, and other Habits of a Phyſitian, who enquiring of her eſtate, and receiving a ſad and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulous
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97700:10"/>
anſwer from her, took her by the hand, and bad her be of good Comfort, for this ſhould be the laſt Fit that ever ſhe ſhould feel of this kinde, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſhe ſeemed to anſwer, that upon that condition, ſhe could well be content for the time, with that, or any other torment: reply was made to her, as ſhe thought, with a redoubled aſſurance of that happy iſſue of this her laſt tryal; whereat ſhe began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an unſpeakable joy; which yet upon her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waking left her more diſconſolate, as then conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her happineſs imaginary, her miſery real; when the very ſame day, ſhe was viſited by the reverend, and (in his time) famous Divine, <hi>Mr. Anthony Gilby,</hi> under whoſe Miniſtry ſhe lived; who, upon the Relation of this her pleaſing Viſion, and the contrary effects it had in her, began to perſwade her, that Dream was no other then Divine, and that ſhe had good reaſon to think that gracious premonition was ſent her from God himſelf, who, though ordinarily he keeps the common rode of his proceedings, yet ſometimes in the Diſtreſſes of his Servants, he goes unuſual wayes to their relief; hereupon ſhe began to take heart, and by good Counſel and her fervent prayers, found that happy prediction verified to her, and upon all occaſions in the remainder of her life, was ready to magnifie the mercy of her God in ſo ſenſible a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance: what with the tryal of both theſe Hands of God, ſo had ſhe profited in the School of Chriſt, that it was hard for any friend to come from her Diſcourſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97700:11"/>
no whit holier; how often have I bleſſed the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of thoſe divine paſſages of experimental Divinity, which I have heard from her mouth! what day did ſhe paſs without a large task of private devotion, whence ſhe would ſtill come forth with a Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of undiſſembled mortification: Never any lips have read to me ſuch feeling Lectures of piety; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have I known any Soul, that more accurately practiſed them, then her own; Temptations, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions, and Spiritual Comforts were her uſual Theme. Shortly, for I can hardly take off my Pen from ſo exemplary a ſubject, her Life and Death were Saint-like.</p>
                  <p>My Parents had from mine Infancy devoted me to this ſacred Calling, whereto, by the bleſſing of God, I have ſeaſonably attained; for this cauſe I was train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in the publick School of the place; After I had ſpent ſome years (not altogether indiligently) under the Ferule of ſuch Maſters as the place afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and had neer attained to ſome competent ripeneſs for the Univerſity; my School-maſter, being a great Admirer of one <hi>Mr. Pelſet,</hi> who was then lately come from <hi>Cambridge,</hi> to be the publick preacher of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi>; (a man very eminent in thoſe times, for the ſame of his Learning, but eſpecially for his ſacred Oratory) perſwaded my Father, that if I might have my Education under ſo excellent and compleat a Divine, it might be both a nearer, and eaſier way to his purpoſed end, then by an Academical Inſtitution;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97700:11"/>
The motion ſounded well in my fathers ears, and carried fair probabilities, neither was it other then fore-compacted betwixt my School-Maſter and Mr. <hi>Pelſet,</hi> ſo as on both ſides it was entertained with great forwardneſs.</p>
                  <p>The Gentleman, upon eſſay taken of my fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the uſe of his ſtudies, undertakes within one ſeven years, to ſend me forth, no leſſe furniſhed with Arts, Languages, and grounds of Theoricall Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, then the carefulleſt Tutor in the ſtrickteſt Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of either Univerſity; VVhich that he might aſſuredly performe, to prevent the danger of any mutable thoughts in my Parents, or my ſelf, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired mutuall bonds to be drawn betwixt us: The great charge of my Father, (whom it pleaſed God to bleſs with twelve children) made him the more apt to yield to ſo likely a project for a younger ſon; There, and now were all the hopes of my future life upon blaſting; the Indentures were preparing, the time was ſet, my ſuites were addreſſed for the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; VVhat was the iſſue?

                     </note> and heartily, in thoſe my young years, I did caſt my ſelf upon thy hands; with what faithfull reſolution, I did in this particular occaſion reſign my ſelf over to thy Diſpoſition, earneſtly begging of thee in my fervent Prayers, to order all things to the beſt, and confidently waiting upon thy VVill for the event; Certainly, never did I in all my life more clearly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97700:12"/>
roll my ſelf upon the Divine Providence, then I did in this buſineſs; and it ſucceeded accordingly; It fell out at this time, that my elder brother having ſome occaſions to journey unto <hi>Cambridge,</hi> was kindly entertained there, by Mr. <hi>Nath. Gilby,</hi> Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of <hi>Emanuel Colledge,</hi> who, for that he was born in the ſame Town with me, and had conceived ſome good opinion of my aptneſs to Learning, inquired diligently concerning me; and hearing of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of my Fathers purpoſes from the Univerſity, importunately diſwaded from that new courſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing to pitty the loſs of ſo good hopes. My Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, partly moved with his words, and partly wonne by his own eyes, to a great love, and reverence of an Academicall life, returning home, fell upon his knees to my Father, and after the report of Mr. <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies</hi> words, and his own admiration of the place, earneſtly beſought him, that he would be pleaſed to alter that ſo prejudiciall a reſolution, that he would not ſuffer my hopes to be drowned in a ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Country-channel; but that he vvould revive his firſt purpoſes for <hi>Cambridge</hi>; adding in the zeal of his love, that if the chargeableneſs of that courſe vvere the hinderance, he did there humbly beſeech him, rather to ſell ſome part of that land, vvhich himſelf ſhould in courſe of Nature inherit, then to abridge me of that happy means to perfect my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner had he ſpoken thoſe vvords then my
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97700:12"/>
Father no leſs paſſionately condeſcended, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a vehement Proteſtation, that whatſoever it might coſt him, I ſhould (God willing) be ſent to the Univerſity; neither were thoſe words ſooner out of his lips, then there was a meſſenger from Mr. <hi>Pelſet</hi> knocking at the door, to call me to that fairer bondage, ſignifying, that the next day he expected me, vvith a full diſpatch of all that buſineſs; To whom my Father replyed, that he came ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes too late, that he had now otherwiſe determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of me, and with a reſpective meſſage of thanks to the Maſter, ſent the man home empty, leaving me full of the tears of joy for ſo happy a change; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I had been but loſt, if that project had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, as it well appeared in the experience of him who ſucceeded in that room, which was by me thus unexpectedly forſaken? O God, how was I then taken up with a thankfull acknowledgment, and joyfull admiration of thy Gracious Providence over me; And now I lived in the expectation of <hi>Cambridge</hi>; whither ere long I happily came, under Mr. <hi>Gilbies</hi> tuition, together with my worthy friend Mr. <hi>Hugh Cholmley,</hi> who, as we had been partners of one leſſon from our Cradles, ſo were we now for many years partners of one Bed; My two firſt years were neceſſarily chargeable, above the proportion of my Fathers power, whoſe not very large Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern, was to feed many pipes beſides mine; His wearineſs of expenſe was wrought upon by the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97700:13"/>
Counſel of ſome unwiſe friends, who perſwaded him to faſten me upon that School as Maſter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I was lately a Scholler; Now was I fetcht home with an heavy heart, and now this ſecond time had mine hopes been nipt in the bloſſome, had not God raiſed me up an unhoped Benefactor, Mr. <hi>Edmund Sleigh</hi> of <hi>Darby</hi> (whoſe pious memory I have cauſe ever to love and reverence) out of no other relation to me, ſave that he married my Aunt, pittying my too apparent dejectedneſs, he voluntarily urged, and ſolicited my Father for my return to the Univerſity, and offered freely to contribute the one half of my maintenance there, till I ſhould attain to the degree of Maſter of Arts, which he no leſs really and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly performed; The condition was gladly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, thither was I ſent back with joy enough, and ere long, choſen Scholler of that ſtrickt and well ordered Colledge: By that time I had ſpent ſix years there, now the third year of my Bachelar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſhould at once both make an end of my main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and in reſpect of ſtanding, give me a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of further preferment in that houſe, were it not that my Country excluded me, for our Statute allowed but one of a ſhire to be fellow there, and my Tutor being of the ſame Town with me, muſt therefore neceſſarily hold me out; But O my God, how ſtrangely did thy gracious Providence fetch this buſineſs about! I was now entertaining motions of remove; A place was offered me in the Iſland of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97700:13"/>
                     <hi>Garnſey,</hi> which I had in Speech and Chaſe; It fell out that the Father of my loving Chamberfellow, Mr. <hi>Cholmley,</hi> a Gentleman that had likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon the moſt Noble <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingdon,</hi> having occaſion to go to <hi>York,</hi> unto that his Honourable Lord, fell into ſome mention of me; That good Earl (who well eſteemed my Fathers Service) having belikely heard ſome better words of me then I could deſerve, made earneſt enquiry after me, what were my Courſes; what my Hopes; and hearing of the likelyhood of my removal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed muoh diſlike of it; not without ſome vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, demanding why I was not choſen Fellow of that Colledge, wherein by report I received ſuch approbation; anſwer was returned, that my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey debarred me; which being filled with my Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, whom his Lordſhip well knew, could not by the Statute admit a ſecond, the Earl preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, that if that were the hinderance he would ſoon take order to remove it; whereupon his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip preſently ſends for my Tutor Mr. <hi>Gilby</hi> unto <hi>York,</hi> and with proffer of large conditions of the Chaplainſhip in his houſe, and aſſured promiſes of better proviſions, drew him to relinquiſh his place in the Colledge to a free Election: No ſooner was his aſſent ſignified, then the dayes were ſet for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick (and indeed exquiſite) examination of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors; By that time two dayes of the three al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to this Tryal were paſt, certain Newes came
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97700:14"/>
to us of the inexpected Death of that incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Religious and Noble Earl of <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> by whoſe loſs my then diſappointed Tutor muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be left to the wide world unprovided for, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on notice thereof I preſently repaired to the Maſter of the Colledge, Mr. Dr. <hi>Chaderton,</hi> and beſought him to tender that hard condition to which my good Tutor muſt needs be driven if the Election proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; to ſtay any farther progreſs in that buſineſs, and to leave me to my own good hopes whereſoever, whoſe Youth expoſed me both to leſs needs, and more opportunities of Proviſion; Anſwer was made me, that the place was pronounced void however, and therefore that my Tutor was deveſted of all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of remedy; and muſt wait upon the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God for his diſpoſing elſewhere, and the Election muſt neceſſarily proceed the day following; then was I with a cheerful unanimity choſen into that Society, which if it had any equals, I dare ſay had none beyond it, for good order, ſtudious carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, ſtrickt government, auſtere Piety, in which I ſpent ſix or ſeven years more with ſuch content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the reſt of my life hath in vain ſtriven to yield; Now was I called to publick Diſputations often, with no ill Succeſs; for never durſt I appear in any of thoſe Exerciſes of Scholarſhip, till I had from my Knees lookt up to Heaven for a bleſſing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed my actual dependance upon that Divine Hand; In this while two years together was I choſen to the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97700:14"/>
Rhetorick Lecture in the publick Schools, where I was encouraged with a ſufficient frequence of Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; but finding that well applauded work ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what out of my way, not without a ſecret blame of my ſelf for ſo much excurſion, I fairly gave up that task in the midſt of thoſe poor Acclamations to a worthy Succeſſor Mr. Dr. <hi>Dod,</hi> and betook my ſelf to thoſe ſerious ſtudies, which might fit me for that High Calling whereunto I was deſtined; wherein after I had carefully beſtowed my ſelf for a time, I took the boldneſs to enter into Sacred Orders; the Honour whereof having once attained, I was no Niggard of that Talent which my God had entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, preaching often as occaſion was offered, both in Country Villages abroad, and at home in the moſt awful Auditory of the Univerſity. And now I did but wait where and how it would pleaſe my God to employ me: There was at that time a famous School erected at <hi>Tiverton</hi> in <hi>Devon,</hi> and endowed with a very large Penſion, whoſe goodly Fabrick was anſwerable to the reported Maintenance; the care whereof, was by the rich and bountiful Founder Mr. <hi>Blundel,</hi> caſt principally upon the then Lord chief Juſtice <hi>Popham</hi>: That faithful Obſerver ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving great intereſt in the Maſter of our Houſe, Dr. <hi>Chaderton,</hi> moved him earneſtly to commend ſome Able, Learned and diſcreet Governour to that weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty charge, whoſe Action ſhould not need to be ſo much as his Overſight: It pleaſed our Maſter out of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97700:15"/>
his good Opinion to tender this condition unto me, aſſuring me of no ſmall advantages, and no great toyl, ſince it was intended the main load of the work ſhould lye upon other ſhoulders; I apprehended the motion worth the entertaining: In that ſevere So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety our times were ſtinted, neither was it wiſe or ſafe to refuſe good Offers: Mr. Dr. <hi>Chaderton</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried me to <hi>London,</hi> and there preſented me to the Lord chief Juſtice with much teſtimony of Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation; the Judge ſeemed well apay'd with the choice, I promiſed Acceptance, He the Strength of his Favour: No ſooner had I parted from the Judge, then in the Street a Meſſinger preſented me with a Letter, from the right Vertuous and VVorthy Lady (of dear and happy Memory) the Lady <hi>Drury</hi> of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> tendring the Rectory of her <hi>Halſted</hi> then newly void, and very earneſtly deſiring me to accept of it; Dr. <hi>Chaderton</hi> obſerving in me ſome change of Countenance, askt me what the matter might be; I told him the Errand, and delivered him the Letter beſeeching his advice; which when he had read, Sir (quoth I) me thinks God pulls me by the Sleeve, and tells me it is his will I ſhould rather go to the Eaſt then to the VVeſt; Nay (he anſwered) I ſhould rather think that God would have you go Weſtward, for that he hath contrived your engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before the tender of this Letter, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore coming too late may receive a fair and eaſy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: to this I beſought him to pardon my diſſent,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97700:15"/>
adding, that I well knew that Divinity was the end whereto I was deſtin'd by my Parents, which I had ſo conſtantly propoſed to my ſelf, that I never meant other, then to paſs through this VVeſtern School to it; but I ſaw that God who found me ready to go the farther way about, now called me the neareſt and directeſt way to that ſacred end; The Good man could no further oppoſe, but only plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the diſtaſte which would hereupon be juſtly taken by the Lord chief Juſtice, whom I undertook fully to ſatisfie; which I did with no great difficulty, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending to his Lordſhip in my room, my old Friend and Chamber-fellow Mr. <hi>Cholmley,</hi> who finding an anſwerable acceptance diſpoſed himſelf to the place; So as we two, who came together to the Univerſity, now muſt leave it at once. Having then fixed my foot at <hi>Halſted,</hi> I found there a dangerous Oppoſite to the Succeſs of my Miniſtry, a witty and bold Atheiſt, one Mr. <hi>Lilly,</hi> who by reaſon of his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, and Abilities of Diſcourſe and Behaviour, had ſo deeply inſinuated himſelf into my Patron, Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Drury,</hi> that there was ſmall hopes (during his entireneſs) for me to work any good upon that Noble Patron of mine; who by the ſuggeſtion of this wicked Detractor was ſet off from me before he knew me; Hereupon (I confeſs) finding the obduredneſs and hopeleſs condition of that man, I bent my prayers againſt him, beſeeching God daily, that he would be pleaſed to remove by ſome means or
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97700:16"/>
other, that apparent hindrance of my faithful La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, who gave me an anſwer accordingly: For this malicious man going haſtily up to <hi>London,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperate my Patron againſt me, was then and there ſwept away by the Peſtilence, and never returned to do any farther Miſchief; Now the coaſt was clear before me, and I gained every day of the good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and favourable reſpects of that Honourable Gentleman, and my worthy Neighbours: Being now therefore ſetled in that ſweet and civil Country of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> near to S. <hi>Edmunds-Bury,</hi> my firſt work was to build up my houſe which was then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ruinous, which done, the uncouth Solitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my life, and the extream incommodity of that ſingle Houſe-keeping, drew my thoughts after two years to condeſcend to the neceſſity of a Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eſtate, which God no leſs ſtrangely provided for me; For walking from the Church on Monday in the <hi>Whitſon-week,</hi> with a Grave and Reverend Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, Mr. <hi>Grandidg,</hi> I ſaw a comely and modeſt Gentlewoman ſtanding at the Door of that houſe where we were invited to a wedding-dinner, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of that worthy Friend whether he knew her, Yes (quoth he) I know her well, and have beſpoken her for your wife; when I further demanded an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that Anſwer, he told me, ſhe was the Daughter of a Gentleman whom he much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, Mr. <hi>George Winniff</hi> of <hi>Bretenham,</hi> that out of an opinion had of the fitneſs of that Match
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97700:16"/>
for me, he had already treated with her Father about it, whom he found very apt to entertain it, adviſing me not to neglect the opportunity; and not concealing the juſt praiſes of the Modeſty, Piety, good Diſpoſition, and other Vertues that were lodged in that ſeemly Preſence; I liſtned to the motion as ſent from God, and at laſt upon due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution happily prevailed, enjoying the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Society of that meet Help for the ſpace of fourty nine years: I had not paſſed two years in this eſtate, when my Noble Friend Sir <hi>Edmund Bacon,</hi> with whom I had much intireneſs came to me, and earneſtly ſollicited me for my Company in a Journey by him projected to the <hi>Spa</hi> in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denna,</hi> laying before me the Safety, the Eaſineſs, the Pleaſure, and the Benefit of that ſmall Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance, if opportunity were taken of that time, when the Earl of <hi>Hertford</hi> paſſed in Embaſſy to the Arch-Duke <hi>Albert</hi> of <hi>Bruxells</hi>; I ſoon yielded, as for the reaſons by him urged, ſo eſpecially for the great deſire I had to inform my ſelf ocularly of the State and practiſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church; the knowledge whereof might be of no ſmall uſe to me in my Holy Station; Having therefore ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken careful order for the Supply of my Charge, with the Aſſent and good allowance of my neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Friends, I entred into this ſecret Voyage; we waited ſome dayes at <hi>Harwich</hi> for a winde, which we hoped might waft us over to <hi>Dunkerk,</hi> where
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97700:17"/>
our <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> had lately landed, but at laſt having ſpent a Day, and half a night at Sea, we were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for want of favour from the wind, to put in at <hi>Quinborow,</hi> from whence coaſting over the Rich and pleaſant Country of <hi>Kent,</hi> we renewed our ſhipping at <hi>Dover,</hi> and ſoon landing at <hi>Calais,</hi> we paſſed after two dayes by Wagon to the ſtrong Towns of <hi>Grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> and <hi>Dunkerk,</hi> where I could not but finde much hor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

From thence we paſſed through <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxberg, Ipre, Gaunt, Courtray,</hi> to <hi>Bruxells,</hi> where the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> had newly ſate down before us, That Noble Gentleman in whoſe Company I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled, was welcomed with many kind Viſitations, amongſt the reſt there came to him an Engliſh Gentleman, who having run himſelf out of breath in the Inns of Court, had forſaken his Country, and therewith his Religion, and was turned both <hi>Bigot</hi> and <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> reſiding now in <hi>Bruxels</hi>; This man after few interchanges of Complement with Sir <hi>Edmund Bacon</hi> fell into a Hyperbolical predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the vvonderful miracles done nevvly by our Lady at <hi>Zichem,</hi> or <hi>Sherpen heavell,</hi> that is <hi>Sharp hill</hi>; by <hi>Lipſius Apricollis</hi>; the credit vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of vvhen that vvorthy Knight vvittily queſtioned, he avovved a particular miracle of cure vvrought by her upon himſelf; I coming into the room
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97700:17"/>
in the midſt of this Diſcourſe (habited not like a Divine, but in ſuch colour and faſhion as might beſt ſecure my travel, and hearing my Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans zealous and confident Relations, at laſt askt him this queſtion, Sir (Quoth I) put caſe this report of yours be granted for true, I beſeech you teach me what difference there is betwixt theſe miracles which you ſay are wrought by this Lady, and thoſe which were wrought by <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> by ſome Veſtalls by Charmes and Spells; the rather for that I have noted, in the late publiſhed report of theſe miracles, ſome Patients preſcribed to come upon a Friday, &amp; ſome to waſh in ſuch a well before their approach; and divers other ſuch Charm-like obſervations; The Gentleman not expecting ſuch a queſtion from me, anſwered, Sir I do not profeſs this kind of Scholarſhip, but we have in the City many famous Divines, with whom if it would pleaſe you to conferr, you might ſooner recieve ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; I askt him whom he took for the moſt eminent Divine of that place, he named to me Father <hi>Coſterus,</hi> undertaking that he would be very glad to give me conference, if I would be pleaſed to come up to the Jeſuites Colledge: I willingly yielded; In the afternoon the forward Gentleman prevented his time to attend me to the Father, (as he ſtyled him,) who (as he ſaid) was ready to entertain me with a meeting; I went alone up with him; the Porter ſhutting
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97700:18"/>
the Door after me, welcomed me with a <hi>Deo gratias</hi>; I had not ſtay'd long in the Jeſuites Hall, before <hi>Coſterus</hi> came in to me, who after a friendly Salutation, fell into a formall ſpeech of the unity of that Church, out of which is no Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and had proceeded to leeſe his Breath, and labour; had not I (as civilly as I might) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted him with this ſhort Anſwer; Sir, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you miſtake me not; My Nation tells you of what Religion I am; I come not hither out of any doubt of my profeſſed belief, or any purpoſe to change it, but moving a queſtion to this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, concerning the pretended miracles of the time, he pleaſed to referr me to your ſelf for my Anſwer, which motion of his I was the more willing to embrace, for the fame that I have heard of your learning and worth, and if you can give me ſatisfaction herein, I am ready to receive it: Hereupon we ſetled to our places, at a Table in the end of the Hall, and buckled to a further diſcourſe; he fell into a poor and unperfect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the difference of Divine miracles and Diabolicall; which I modeſtly refuted; from thence he ſlipt into a Cholerick invective againſt our Church, which (as he ſaid) could not yield one miracle; and when I anſwered, that in our Church, we had manifeſt proofs of the ejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Divells by faſting and prayer, he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that if it could be proved, that ever any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97700:18"/>
was diſpoſſeſſed in our Church, he would quit his Religion. Many queſtions were incidently tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed by us; wherein I found no ſatisfaction given me; The conference was long and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; in the heat whereof, who ſhould come in but Father <hi>Baldwin,</hi> an Engliſh Jeſuite, known to me, as by face (after I came to <hi>Bruſſells</hi>) ſo much more by Fame; he ſate down upon a bench, at the further end of the table, and heard no ſmall part of our Diſſertation, ſeeming not too well apaid, that a Gentleman of his Nation, (for ſtill I was ſpoken to in that habit, by the ſtile of <hi>Dominatio veſtra</hi>) ſhould depart from the Jeſuites Colledge no better ſatisfied: On the next morning therefore he ſends the ſame En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Phyſitian to my Lodging, with a courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous compellation, profeſſing to take it unkindly, that his Country-man ſhould make choice of any other, to conferr with, then himſelf, who deſired both mine acquaintance and full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. Sr. <hi>Edmund Bacon,</hi> in whoſe hearing the meſſage was delivered, gave me ſecret ſignes of his utter unwillingneſs to give way to my further conferences, the iſſue whereof (ſince we were to paſs further, and beyond the bounds of that Protection) might prove dangerous, I returned a mannerly anſwer of thanks to <hi>F. Baldwin</hi>; but for any further conference, that it were bootleſs, I could not hope to convert
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97700:19"/>
him, and was reſolv'd, he ſhould not alter me, and therefore both of us ſhould reſt where we were. Departing from <hi>Bruſſells</hi> we were for <hi>Namur's,</hi> and <hi>Liege</hi>: in the way we found the good hand of God, in delivering us from the danger of free-booters, and of a nightly entrance (amidſt a ſuſpicious convoy) into that bloody City. Thence we came to the <hi>Spadane</hi> waters, where I had good leaſure to add a ſecond century of Meditations to thoſe I had publiſhed before my jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; After we had ſpent a juſt time at thoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinall wells, we returned to <hi>Liege,</hi> and in our paſſage up the River <hi>Moſa,</hi> I had a dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with a <hi>Sorboniſt,</hi> a Prior of the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> who took occaſion by our kneeling at the receit of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> to perſwade all the company of our acknowledgment of a Tranſubſtantiation; I ſatisfyed the cavill, ſhowing upon what ground this meet poſture obtained with us: the man grew furious upon his conviction, and his vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aſſociates began to joyn with him, in a right down railing upon our Church, and Religion; I told them they knew where they were, for me, I had taken notice of the ſecurity of their Laws, inhibiting any argument held againſt their Religion eſtabliſhed, and therefore ſtood only upon my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe, not caſting any aſperſion upon theirs, but ready to maintain our own, which though I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in as fair terms as I might, yet the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97700:19"/>

others that were contrarily minded, both Engliſh, Scotiſh, and French Divines, profered their hands to a no leſs ready ſubſcription; So as much peace promiſed to reſult, out of that weak and poor enterpriſe, had not the confuſed noiſe of the miſconſtructions of thoſe, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw the work, (crying it down for the very Names ſake) meeting with the royall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of a general Inhibition, buryed it in a ſecure Silence.

Immediately before the Publiſhing of this Tractate, (which did not a little aggravate, the envy and ſuſpicion) I was by his Majeſty raiſed to the Biſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick of <hi>Exceter,</hi> having formerly (with much hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Deprecation) refuſed the See of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly proffered unto me; How beyond all expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it pleaſed God to place me in that Weſtern charge; which (if the Duke of <hi>Buckinghams</hi> Letters, he being then in <hi>France,</hi> had arived but ſome hours ſooner) I had been defeated of; and by what ſtrange means it pleaſed God to make up the Competency of that proviſion, by the unthought of addition of the Rectory of St. <hi>Breok</hi> within that Dioceſs, if I ſhould fully relate, the Circumſtances, would force the Confeſſion of an extraordinary hand of God in the diſpoſing of thoſe events, I entred upon that place, not without much prejudice and ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on ſome hands; for ſome that ſate at the ſterne of the Church, had me in great Jelouſie for too much favour of Puritaniſme; I ſoon had intelligence who were ſet over me for eſpialls; my ways were Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly obſerved, and ſcanned; However I took the reſolution to follow thoſe courſes which might moſt conduce to the Peace and happineſs of my New and weighty charge; finding therefore ſome factious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits very buſie in that Dioceſs, I uſed all fair and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle means to win them to good order; and therein ſo happily prevailed, that (ſaving two of that nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Clergy, who continuing in their refractori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

The Parliament was no ſooner ſate, then many vehement Speeches were made againſt eſtabliſhed Church-government, and enforcement of extirpation both root and branch. And becauſe it was not fit to ſet upon all at once, the reſolution was to begin with thoſe Biſhops which had
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97700:32"/>
ſubſcribed to the Canons then lately publiſhed, upon the ſhutting up of the former Parliament, whom they would firſt have had accuſed of Treaſon; but that not appearing feiſible, they thought beſt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite them of very high crimes and offences againſt the King, the Parliament, and Kingdom, which was proſecuted with great earneſtneſs by ſome prime Lawyers in the Houſe of Commons, and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with like fervency by ſome zealous Lords in the Houſe of Peers; every of thoſe particular Canons being preſſed to the moſt envious and dangerous height that was poſſible. The Arch-biſhop of <hi>York</hi> (was deſigned for the report) aggravating Mr. <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nards</hi> criminations to the utmoſt, not without ſome Interſperſions of his own. The Counſel of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed Biſhops gave in ſuch a demurring Anſwer as ſtopt the mouth of that heinous Indictment: when this prevailed not, it was contrived to draw Petitions accuſatory from many parts of the Kingdom againſt Epiſcopal Government, and the Promoters of the petitions were entertained with great reſpects; whereas the many petitions of the oppoſite part, though ſubſcribed with many thouſand hands, were ſleighted and diſregarded. VVithall, the Rabble of <hi>London,</hi> after their petitions cunningly and upon other pretences procured, were ſtirred up to come to the Houſes perſonally to crave juſtice both againſt the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> firſt, and then againſt the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and laſtly againſt the whole

Meſſages were ſent down to them from the Lords, they ſtill held firm both to the place and their bloody reſolutions.

avowing it to be legall, juſt and Agreeable to all former Proceedings, and being fair written ſent it to our ſeverall Lodgings for our Hands, which we accordingly ſubſcribed, intending yet to have had ſome further Conſultation concerning the delivering and whole carriage of it. But ere we could ſuppoſe it to be in any hand but his own, the firſt Newes we heard was, that there were Meſſingers addreſſed to fetch us in to the Parliament upon an Accuſation of high Treaſon. For whereas this Paper was to have been delivered, firſt to his Majeſties Secretary; and after peruſall by him to his Majeſtie, and after from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie to the Parliament, and for that purpoſe to the Lord Keeper, the Lord <hi>Littleton,</hi> who was the Speaker of the houſe of Peers; all theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed not to have peruſed it at all, but the ſaid Lord Keeper willing enough to take this Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Ingratiating himſelf with the Houſe of Commons and the faction, to which he knew himſelf ſufficiently obnoxious, finding what uſe might be made of it by prejudicate minds, reads the ſame openly in the houſe of the Lords: and when he found ſome of the faction apprehenſive enough of miſconſtruction, Aggravates the matter as highly offenſive, and of dangerous conſequence; and thereupon not without much heat and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, and with an ill Preface<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is ſent down to the Houſe of Commons; where it was entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

hainouſly, <hi>Glynne</hi> with a full mouth crying it up for no leſs then an high Treaſon; and ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring, yea preferring it to the Powder-plot. VVe poor ſouls (who little thought that we had done any thing that might deſerve a chiding) are now called to our Knees at the barr, and charged ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally with high Treaſon, being not a little aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at the ſuddainneſs of this Crimination, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the perfect Innocence of our own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, which were only to bring us to our due places in Parliament with ſafety and ſpeed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt purpoſe of any mans offence; But now Traytors we are in all the haſte, and muſt be dealt with accordingly; For on <hi>January</hi> 30 in all the extreamity of Froſt, at Eight a Clock in the dark Evening, are we voted to the Tower; Only two of our Number had the favour of the black Rod by reaſon of their Age, which though deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a Noble Lord on my behalf, would not be yielded, wherein I acknowledg, and bleſs the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious providence of my God, for had I been gratified, I had been undone both in body and Purſe; the rooms being ſtrait, and the expence beyond the reach of my eſtate: The newes of this our crime and impriſonment ſoon flew over the City, and was entertained by our well-willers with ringing of Bells and Bonfires; who now gave us up (not without great Triumph) for loſt men railing, on our perfidiouſneſs, and adjudging us

to what foul Deaths they pleaſed; and what ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rile and malicious pamphlets were ſcattered abroad, throughout the Kingdom, and in forraign parts, blazoning our Infamy, and exaggerating our trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable practiſes? what inſultations of our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries was here? being caged ſure enough in the Tower, the faction had now fair oportunities to work their own deſignes, they therefore taking the advantage of our reſtraint, renew that bill of theirs, (which had been twice before rejected ſince the begining of this Seſſion) for taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the votes of Biſhops in Parliament, and in a very thin houſe eaſily paſſed it: VVhich once condeſcended unto, I know not by what ſtrong importunity, his Majeſties aſſent was drawn from him thereunto; we now inſtead of looking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our wonted Honour muſt bend our thoughts upon the guarding of our lives, which were with no ſmall eagerneſs, purſued by the violent Agents of the Faction. Their ſharpeſt wits and greateſt Lawyers were imployed to advance our Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the height; but the more they lookt into the buſineſs, the leſs crime could they find to faſten upon us: In ſo much as one of their Oracles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demanded his judgment concerning the fact, profeſſed to them, they might with as good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon accuſe us of Adultery: Yet ſtill there are we faſt; only upon petition to the Lords obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this favour, that we might have counſel

After we had lyen ſome weekes there, however the houſe of Commons, upon the firſt tender of our Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had deſired we might be brought to a ſpeedy tryall, yet now finding belike how little ground they had for ſo high an Accuſation, they began to ſlack their pace, and ſuffered us rather to languiſh under the fear of ſo dreadfull Arraignment. In ſo much as now we are fain to Petition the Lords that we might be brought to our tryall: the day was ſet, ſeveral ſummons were ſent unto us; the Lieutenant had his warrant to bring us to the Barr; Our impeachment was ſeverally read; we pleaded not guilty <hi>Modo &amp; forma,</hi> and deſired ſpeedy proceedings, which were accordingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, but not to haſtily performed. After long expectation another day was appointed for the proſecution of this high charge. The Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

brought us again to the Barr, but with what ſhoutings and exclamations and furious expreſſions of the enraged Multitudes, it is not eaſie to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend; being thither brought and ſeverally charged upon our Knees, and having given our Negative Anſwers to every particular, Two Biſhops, <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> were call'd in as witneſſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, as in that point, whether they apprehended any ſuch cauſe of fears in the tumults aſſembled, as that we were in any danger of our Lives in coming to the Parliament; who ſeemed to incline to a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable report of the Perills threatned, though one of them was convinced out of his own Mouth, from the Relations himſelf had made at the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Yorks</hi> Lodging. After this <hi>Wild</hi> and <hi>Glyn</hi> made fearfull declamations at the Barr againſt us, aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all the Circumſtances of our pretended Treaſon to the higheſt pitch. Our Counſell were all ready at the Barr to plead for us in Anſwer of their clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and envious ſuggeſtions; but it was anſwered, that it was now too late, we ſhould have another day, which Day to this Day never came; the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of that day's hearing were more Grievous to us then the ſubſtance; for we were all throng'd ſo miſerably in that ſtrait room before the Barr, by reaſon that the whole houſe of Commons would be thereto ſee the prizes of their Champions plaid; that we ſtood the whole afternoon in no ſmall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſweating and ſtrugling with a Mercileſs Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,

That God, under whoſe Mercifull Protection we are, returned us to our ſafe Cuſtodie: There now we lay ſome weeks longer, expecting the ſummons for our Counſails an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; but inſtead thereof our Merciful Adverſaries, well finding how ſure they would be foyl'd in that unjuſt charge of Treaſon, now under pretences of remitting the height of rigour, wave their former Impeachment of Treaſon againſt us, and fall upon an Accuſation of high Miſdemeaners in that our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, and will have us proſecuted as guilty of a <hi>Premunire</hi>: although as we conceive the law hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been in the Parliamentary proceedings, that if a man were impeached, as of Treaſon, being the higheſt crime, the Accuſant muſt hold him to the proof of the charge, and may not fall to any meaner Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon failing of the higher.

Biſhop for his maintenance, according to a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by them ſet down; wherein they were pleaſed that my ſhare ſhould come to 400<hi>
                        <hi rend="sup">p</hi>. per annum:</hi> this bill was ſent up to the Lords and by them alſo paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and there hath ever ſince lyen: this being done, after ſome weeks more, finding the Tower beſides the Reſtraint, chargeable; we petitioned the Lords that we might be admitted to bail; and have liberty to return to our Homes the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> moved, the Lords aſſented, took our bail, ſent to the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Tower for our diſcharge: How glad were we to flie out of our Cage? No ſooner was I got to my Lodging, then I thought to take a little freſh Air, in St. <hi>James</hi> his Park; and in my return to my Lodging in the Deans yard, paſſing through <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter</hi> Hall, was ſaluted by divers of my Parliament acquaintance, and welcomed to my liberty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſome that look't upon me with an evil eye run into the Houſe, and complained that the Biſhops were let looſe, which it ſeems was not well taken by the houſe of Commons, who preſently ſent a kind of expoſtulation to the Lords, that they had diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo haynous offenders without their knowledg and conſent; Scarce had I reſted me in my lodging, when there comes a Meſſinger to me with the ſad newes of ſending me and the reſt of my brethren the Biſhops back to the Tower again; from whence we came, thither we muſt go; and thither I went with an heavy (but I thank God not impatient)

heart. After we had continued there ſome ſix weeks longer, and earneſtly Petitioned to return to our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall charges, we were upon 5000<hi>

Thus having ſpent the time betwixt New years Even and VVhitſontide in thoſe ſafe walls, where we by turnes preached every Lords Day to a large Auditory of Cittizens, we diſpoſed of our ſelves to the places of our ſeverall abode.</p>
                  <p>For my ſelf, addreſſing my ſelf to <hi>Norwich,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was his Majeſties pleaſure to remove me, I was at the firſt received with more reſpect, then in ſuch times I could have expected; there I preached the day after my arivall to a numerous and attentive peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; nether was ſparing of my pains in this kind ever ſince, till the times growing every day more impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of a Biſhop, threatned my ſilencing. There though with ſome ſecret Murmurs of diſaffected perſons, I enjoyed peace till the ordinance of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtration came forth, which was in the latter end of <hi>March</hi> following, then when I was in hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the profits of the fore-going half year; for the maintenance of my family, were all my Rents ſtopped and diverted, and in the <hi>Aprill</hi> following came the ſequeſtrators viz. Mr. <hi>Sothertou</hi> Mr. <hi>Tooly</hi> Mr. <hi>Rawly</hi> Mr. <hi>Greenewood,</hi> &amp;c. To the Palace and told me that by vertue of an ordinance of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliment they muſt ſeize upon the Palace, and all the eſtate I had, both reall and perſonall, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:97700:37"/>
ſent certain men appointed by them (whereof one had been burnt in the hand for the mark of his Truth,) to apprize all the goods that were in the houſe, which they accordingly executed with all diligent ſeverity, not leaving ſo much as a dozen of Trenchers, or my Childrens pictures out of their curious Inventory. Yea they would have appri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed our very wearing clothes, had not Alderman <hi>Tooly</hi> and Sheriff <hi>Rawley</hi> (to whom I ſent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire their Judgment concerning the Ordinance in this point) declared their opinion to the contrary. Theſe goods, both Library and houſhold ſtuff of all kinds, were appointed to be expoſed to publick ſale. Much inquiry there was when the goods ſhould be brought to the Market; but in the mean time Mrs. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> a religious good Gentlewoman, whom yet we had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver known or ſeen, being moved with compaſſion, very kindly offered to lay down to the Sequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors that whole ſumme which the goods were valued at; and was pleaſed to leave them in our hands for our uſe, till we might be able to repurchaſe them, which ſhe did accordingly and had the goods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally delivered to her by Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> and Mr. <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> two Sequeſtrators. As for the books, ſeverall Stationers lookt on them, but were not forward to buy them; at laſt Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> a worthy Divine of this Dioceſs, gave bond to the Sequeſtrators, to pay to them the whole ſumme whereat they were ſet, which was afterwards ſatisfied out of that poor pittance, that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97700:38"/>
was allowed me for my Maintenance; as for my evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences they required them from me, I denyed them, as not holding my ſelf bound to deliver them: They nailed, and ſealed up the door, and took ſuch as they found with me.</p>
                  <p>But before this, the firſt noiſe that I heard of my trouble was, that one Morning, before my ſervants were up, there came to my Gates one <hi>Wright,</hi> a <hi>London</hi> Trooper, attended with others, requiring en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, threatning if they were not admitted to break open the Gates; whom I found at my firſt ſight ſtrugling with one of my Servants for a Piſtol, which he had in his hand; I demanded his buſineſs at that unſeaſonable time; he told me, he came to ſearch for Armes and Amunition, of which I muſt be diſarm'd; I told him I had only two Muskets, in the houſe, and no other Military Proviſion; he not reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon my word ſearcht round about the houſe, lookt into the Cheſts, and Trunks, examined the Veſſells in the Cellar; finding no other VVarliek furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he askt me what Horſes I had, for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was to take them alſo; I told him how poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I was ſtored, and that my age would not allow me to travell on foot; In concluſion he took one Horſe for the preſent, and ſuch accompt of another, that he did highly expoſtulate with me afterwards, that I had otherwiſe diſpoſed of him.</p>
                  <p>Now not only my Rents preſent, but the Arrera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the former Years which I had in favour for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:97700:38"/>
to ſome Tenants, being treacherouſly confeſſed to the Sequeſtrators, were by them called for, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from me; neither was there any courſe at all ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for my maintenance; I therefore addreſſed my ſelf to the Committee ſitting here at <hi>Norwich,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired them to give order for ſome means, out of that large Patrimony of the Church, to be allowed me. They all thought it very juſt, and there being preſent Sr. <hi>Tho. VVoodhouſe,</hi> and Sr. <hi>John Potts,</hi> Parliament men; it was moved, and held fit by them and the reſt, that the Proportion which the Votes of the Paliament had pitcht upon, viz. 400<hi>
                        <hi rend="sup">l</hi>. per annum</hi>; ſhould be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me. My Lord of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> who was then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to have great power in matter of theſe Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, was moved herewith; He apprehended it very juſt and reaſonable, and wrote to the Committee here to ſet out ſo many of the Mannors belonging to this Biſhoprick as ſhould amount to the ſaid ſumme of 400<hi>
                        <hi rend="sup">l</hi>.</hi> annually; which was anſwerably done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hands of the whole Table. And now I well hoped, I ſhould yet have a good Competency of maintenance out of that plentifull Eſtate which I might have had: But thoſe hopes were no ſooner conceived then daſht; for before I could gather up one Quarters Rent, there comes down an Order from the Committee for Sequeſtrations above, under the hand of Sergeant <hi>Wild</hi> the Chair-man, procured by Mr. <hi>Miles Corbet,</hi> to inhibit any ſuch allowance; and telling our Committee here, that neither They, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97700:39"/>
other had Power to allow me any thing at all: But if my Wife found her ſelf to need a Maintenance; upon her Sute to the Committee of Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, it might be granted that She ſhould have a fifth part, according to the Ordinance, allowed for the ſuſtentation of her ſelf, and her Family. Hereupon ſhe ſends a Petition up to that Committee, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long delay was admitted to be read, and an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der granted for the fifth part: But ſtill the Rents and Revinues both of my Spirituall and Temporall Lands were taken up by the Sequeſtrators both in <hi>Norfolke,</hi> and <hi>Suffolke,</hi> and <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and we kept off from either al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance or accompt. At laſt upon much preſſing, <hi>Beadle</hi> the Solicitor, and <hi>Rust</hi> the Collector, brought in an Account to the Committee, ſuch as it was; but ſo Confuſed and Perplexed and ſo utterly unperfect, that we could never come to know what a fifth part meant: But they were content that I ſhould eat my books by ſetting off the Sum, engaged for them out of the fifth part. Mean time the Synodalls both in <hi>Norfolke</hi> and <hi>Suffolke,</hi> and all the Spirituall profits of the Dioceſs, were alſo kept back, only Ordinations and Inſtitutions continued a while. But after the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was appointed to be taken, and was generally ſwallowed of both Clergy and Layety, my power of ordination was with ſome ſtrange violence reſtrained; For when I was going on in my wonted courſe (which no Law or Ordinance had inhibited) certain forward Voluntiers in the Citty, banding together,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:97700:39"/>
ſtir up the Mayor and Aldermen and Sheriffs to call me to an account for an open violation of their Covenant. To this purpoſe divers of them came to my Gates at a very unſeaſonable time, and knocking very vehemently, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſpeak with the Biſhop; Meſſages were ſent to them to know their buſineſs, nothing would ſatisfie them but the Biſhops preſence, at laſt I came down to them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded what the matter was; they would have the gate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, &amp; then they would tell me; I anſwered that I would know them better firſt: If they had any thing to ſay to me I was ready to hear them; they told me they had a writing to me from Mr. <hi>Mayor,</hi> &amp; ſome other of their Magiſtrates; the paper contained both a challenge of me for breaking the Covenant, in ordaining Miniſters; and withal required me to give in the Names of thoſe which were ordained by me both then and formerly ſince the Covenant: My an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was that Mr. Mayor was much abuſed by thoſe who had miſinform'd him, &amp; drawn that paper from him; that I would the next day give a ful anſwer to the writing, they moved that my anſwer might be by my perſonal appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at the <hi>Guild-hall</hi>; I askt them when they ever heard of a Biſhop of <hi>Norwich</hi> appearing before a Mayor, I knew mine own place, &amp; would take that way of anſwer which I thought ſit, and ſo diſmiſſed them, who had given out that day, that had they known before of mine ordaining, they would have pull'd me &amp; thoſe whom I ordained out of the Chappell by the Ears. VVhiles I received nothing, yet ſomething was required of me; they were not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med after they had taken away, and ſold all my Goods and perſonall eſtate, to come to me for aſſeſments, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:97700:40"/>
monethly payments for that eſtate which they had taken, and took Diſtreſſes from me upon my moſt juſt denyall, and vehemently required me to finde the wonted Armes of my Predeceſſors, when they had left me nothing: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſolencies and affronts were in all this time put upon us. One while a whole rabble of Voluntiers come to my Gates late, when they were locked up, and called for the porter to give them entrance, which being not yielded, they threatned to make by force, and had not the ſaid gates been very ſtrong they had done it: Others of them clambred over the walls, and would come into mine houſe, their errand (they ſaid) was to ſearch for Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, what they would have done I know not, had not we by a ſecret way ſent to raiſe the Officers for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue: Another while the Sheriff <hi>Toftes,</hi> and Alderman <hi>Linſey,</hi> attended with many Zealous followers, came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Chappell to look for Superſtitious Pictures, and Reliques of Idolatry, and ſend for me, to let me know they found thoſe VVindowes full of Images, which were very offenſive, and muſt be demoliſhed: I told them they were the Pictures of ſome antient and worthy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, as St. <hi>Ambroſe, Austin,</hi> &amp;c. It was anſwered me, that they were ſo many Popes; and one younger man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt (<hi>Townſend</hi> as I perceived afterwards) would take upon him to defend that every Dioceſan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop was Pope, I anſwered him with ſome ſcorn, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained leave that I might with the leaſt loſs, and defacing of the windows give order for taking off that offence, which I did by cauſing the heads of thoſe Pictures to be taken off, ſince I knew the Bodies could not offend. There
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:97700:40"/>
was not that care and moderation uſed in reforming the Cathedrall Church bordering upon my Palace. It is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then Tragical to relate the carriage of that furious Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilidge, whereof our eyes and ears were the ſad witneſſes, under the Authority and preſence of <hi>Linſey, Tofts</hi> the Sheriffe, and <hi>Greenwood</hi>; Lord, what work was here, what clattering of Glaſſes, what beating down of VValls, what tearing up of Monuments, what pulling down of Seates, what wreſting out of Irons and Braſs from the Windowes and Graves! what defacing of Armes, what demoliſhing of curious Stone-work, that had not any repreſentation in the VVorld, but only of the coſt of the Founder, and skill of the Maſon, what toting and piping upon the deſtroyed Organ pipes, and what a hideous triumph on the Market day before all the Countrey, when in a kind of Sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and profane proceſſion, all the Organ pipes, Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, both Copes and Surplices, together with the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Croſſe, which had been newly ſawne down from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Green-Yard Pulpit, and the Service books and ſinging books that could be had, were carried to the fire in the publick Market place; A leud wretch walking before the Train, in his Cope trailing in the dirt, with a Service book in his hand imitating in an inpious ſcorne the tune, and uſurping the words of the Letany uſed formerly in the Church: Neer the publick Croſſe, all theſe monuments of Idolatry muſt be ſacrificed to the fire, not without much Oſtentation of a zealous joy in diſcharging ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to the coſt of ſome who profeſſed how much they had long'd to ſee that Day. Neither was it any newes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:97700:41"/>
this Guild-day to have the Cathedrall now open on all ſides to be filled with Muskatiers, wayting for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jors returne, drinking and tobacconing as freely as if it had turn'd Alehouſe. Still yet I remained in my Palace though with but a poor retinue and means; but the houſe was held too good for Me: Many meſſages were ſent by Mr. <hi>Corbet</hi> to remove me thence; The firſt pretence was, that the Committee, who now vvas at charge for an Houſe to ſit in, might make their dayly Seſſion there, being a place both more publick, roomy, and chargeleſſe. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee after many conſultations reſolved it covenient to remove thither, though many overtures, and offers were made to the contrary: Mr. <hi>Corbet</hi> was impatient of my ſtay there, and procures and ſends peremptory meſſages for my preſent diſlodging, we deſired to have ſome time allowed for providing ſome other Manſion, if we muſt needs be caſt out of this, which my wife was ſo willing to hold, that ſhe offered, (if the charge of the preſent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee houſe were the things ſtood upon) ſhe would be content to defray the ſumme of the rent of that houſe of her fifth part; but that might not be yielded; out we muſt and that in three weeks warning by Midſommerday then approching, ſo as we might have lyen in the ſtreet for ought I know, had not the Providence of God ſo order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, that a Neighbour in the Cloſe, one Mr. <hi>Goſtlin,</hi> a Widower was content to void his Houſe for us.</p>

As wiſdom hath eyes to note evils, ſo faithfulneſs hath a tongue to notifie them: We are by our profeſſion the Seers of God in reſpect of our Eyes, and we are the Prophets of God in reſpect of our tongues, it muſt be our care, to make uſe of both titles, we are blinde guides, if we ſee not: we are dumb Dogs, if we give not warning of what we ſee; as good no eyes, as no tongue. There was in the North part of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the Tower of the Furnaces, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 3.11. wherein it ſeems there was continual fire kept for the Way-mark of Travellers; that flame was both vocal and real; admoniſhing the paſſenger of his errours, and guiding him in his courſe; ſuch we either are or ſhould be: like to <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> who was a Burning, and a Shining light, Burning for his own zeal, Shining for the Direction of others; direction, as in example of life, ſo in precepts of Doctrine: we ſhould not be like Dyals on a wall, or Watches in our pockets, to teach the eye, but like clocks and larums, to ring in the ear: <hi>Aaron</hi> muſt wear Bells, as well as Pomegranates; Yea louder then ſo, the Prophets voyce muſt be a Trumpet, whoſe ſound may be heard farr off, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.1.</p>
                  <p>God will never thank us for keeping his counſel, he will thank us for divulging it: and that St. <hi>Paul</hi> knew well enough, when in his farewel to the Elders of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> he appealed to their Conſciences, that he had <hi>kept back nothing that was profitable unto them, but had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto them all the counſels of God, Act.</hi> 20.20, and 27. Our Saviour therefore bids us not to run into corners and whiſper his meſſages, but to get us unto the houſe top, and to make the higheſt roof and battlements our Pulpit. Woe therefore to thoſe <hi>Sigalion</hi>-like ſtatues, who taking up a room in Gods Church, ſit there with their fingers upon their mouthes, making a trade of either wilful or lazy ſilence; ſmothering in their breaſts the ſins and dangers of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. It is a witty and good obſervation of <hi>Gregory,</hi> that the Prophet
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97700:42"/>
prayes, <hi>ſet a door before my lips</hi>; a door not a wall, he would not have his tongue mur'd up for all occaſions, but ſo locked, that it may be ſeaſonably let looſe and free, when the convenience or neceſſity of his own Soul, or others require it; The neglect or reſtraint of which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty ſhall lye heavy upon many a Soul; Surely the blood of all thoſe ſouls that have miſcarried through their unfaithful ſilence, cryes loud to Heaven againſt them, and ſhall one day be required at their hands.</p>
                  <p>If I ſhall ſee a blind man walking towards ſome deep pit, or dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly precipice, if I do not warn him of it, and prevent his fall, I am not much leſſe guilty of his death, then if I had thruſt him down: It is a clear and familiar caſe that of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 33.7, &amp;c. <hi>Son of man, I have ſet thee for a watchman to the Houſe of Iſrael, therefore thou ſhalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them of it; When I ſay to the wicked, O wicked man, thou ſhalt ſurely dye. If thou doeſt not ſpeak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man ſhall dye in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thine hand.</hi> A ſleeping Centinel is the loſs of a whole City, the forfeiture of his own life is the leaſt piece of the miſchief he is guilty of; Oh therefore ye, that are the watchmen of the Lord rouze up your ſelves; and as you deſire to avoid ſo many vengeances as there are ſouls loſt by your drouzineſs, and taciturnity, beſtir your tongues, in giving warning to Gods people of their ſpirituall dangers, as our Apoſtle, doth here; <hi>I have told you, and now tell you again.</hi> Thus much for the warning; now the Frequence followes, <hi>I have told you often.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not once, not ſeldome had the Apoſtle told his Philippians of theſe inordinate walkers, but often: <hi>St. Paul</hi> feared not the ſlander of a Tautology; Rather like a conſtant workman he beats ſtill upon the ſame anvil; There can never be too much warning of that, whereof there can never be enough heed. Nice ears are all for variety of Doctrines, as palates of meats; <hi>Quouſque eadem</hi>; what ſtill the ſame over and over? Is the note of both: How ſcornfully do theſe Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons look at the often entrance of the ſame ſtanding diſhes: St. <hi>Paul</hi> hates to feed this wanton humour, and tells them this ſingle diet is ſafe for them, and to himſelf not grevious, and therefore not fearing their ſurfet of ſo wholeſome a ſervice, he ſtill ſets before them the ſame meſſe: <hi>I have told you often, and now tell you again.</hi> We tell over the ſame numbers in the counting of our coyn, and are not weary of it: In our recreations, we ſpend the night after the day at the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97700:43"/>
ſame game, and complain not of ſatiety; why ſhould we who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe our ſelves ſpiritual ſo ſoon nauſeate at the iteration of good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. Perhaps if we would ſeek <hi>Athens</hi> in our City, we ſhould not loſe our labour; There is an itch of the ear, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> foreſaw would prove the diſeaſe of the latter times, that now is groan epidemical; an itch after newes, even in Gods chair, new Doctrines, new dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: and ſurely it muſt needs be confeſſed, that of latter years there was much fault in this kind; too many Pulpits were full of curious affectation of new quirks of wit, new crochets of conceit, ſtrange mixtures of opinions: In ſo much as the old and plain formes were grown ſtale, and deſpicable; let me tell you I ſtill feared this itch would end in a ſmart. Certainly there cannot be a more certain argument of a decayed and ſickly ſtomack, then the loathing of wholſome and ſolid food, and longing after fine quelque choices of new and artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial compoſition; For us; away with this vain affectation in the matters of God; ſurely if ought under Heaven go down better with us then the ſavoury viands of Chriſt, and him crucified, of faith and repentance, and thoſe plainly dreſſed, without all the lards and ſauces of humane devices, (to ſay no worſe) our ſoules are ſick, and we feel it not. Oh ye fooliſh Iſraelites with whom too much fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence made the food of Angels contemptible. If Onions and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick had grown as riſely in the Wilderneſſe, and Manna had rained down no where but in <hi>Egypt,</hi> how would ye have hated thoſe rude and ſtrong Salades, and have run mad for thoſe celeſtial delicates; The taſt of Manna was as of <hi>Wafers made with Hony, Exod.</hi> 16.31. now what can be ſweeter then hony? Yet ſayes the Wiſe man, the <hi>Full diſpiſeth an hony comb</hi>; I doubt there are too many thus full; full of the World, full of wicked nature, of ſinful corruptions; and then no marvell if they deſpiſe this food of Angels; but for us my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, Oh let us not be weary of our happineſs, let not theſe dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Heaven loſe their worth for their ſtore; every Day let us go forth of our tents and gather; and while we are nouriſhed, let us not be cloyed with good; elſe, God knowes a remedy, he knowes how to make the Word precious to us, precious in the want, becauſe it was not precious to us in the Valuation. He that hath told us, how precious Peace is by the ſence of a wofull War, can ſoon ſhow us, how precious his word was by a ſpiritual famine; which God for his mercies ſake avert from us.</p>

                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:97700:43"/>I might here have done with the frequence, but let me add this one conſideration more, that often inculcation of warning, neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implies a danger: There is much danger in a contagious converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; evill is of a ſpreading nature: ſin as leaven, yea old leaven, fowres the whole lumpe where it lyes; yea it is a very plague that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the Air round about it; If (as the entrances of ſin are baſhfull) it begin with one Angell, it infects legions, let it begin with one Woman, it infects all the maſs of Mankind; One perſon infects a Family; one Family a whole Street, one Street a whole City, one City a whole Country, one Country a whole World; yea it runs like powder in a train, and flies out ſuddainly on all ſides: Look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout you, and ſee, whether you need any other witneſſes then your own eyes; Do ye not ſee daily, how drunkenneſs doth in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of the nature of that liquor which cauſeth it, that it is not eaſily contained within it's own bounds; The vice as well as the humour is diffuſive of it ſelf; how rarely have you ever ſeen a ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry drunkard; no the very title which is miſ-given to this ſin, is <hi>good Fellowſhip</hi>; Mark if oaths where leud men are met, do not flie about like ſquibs on a wheel, whereof one gives fire to another, and all do as it were counter-thunder to Heaven: on bold ſwearer makes many, and the land mournes with the number.

Behold the precious liquor which is reſerved as the deareſt relique of Heaven in the bottles of the Almighty; every dram whereof is valued at an eternall weight of glory; even a cup of cold water ſhall once be rewarded; and behold every drop of this warme water is more worth, then many cups of cold; weep thus awhile, and laugh for ever; ſowe thus in tears, and be ſure to reap in joy: But wo is me, what ſhall I ſay to thoſe men that make themſelves merry with nothing ſo much as ſin; their own, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whether their act, or their memory.

Oh God that Chriſtians and Divells ſhould meet in the ſame conſort; that we ſhould laugh at that, for which our Saviour wept, and bled; that we ſhould ſmile at that upon earth, whereat God frowns in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and make that our delight, wherewith the holy ſpirit of God is grieved.

                  <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> weeps to tell of mens ſins; tears do well in the pulpit: as it is in the buckets of ſome pumps, that water muſt firſt be powred down into them, ere they can fetch up water in abundance, ſo muſt our tears be let down to fetch up more from our hearers; the chair of God can never be better fitted then with a weeping Auditory; I remember holy <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaking of his own Sermons, ſaith, that when he ſaw the people did ſhow contentment and delight in their countenances, and ſeemed to give applauſes to his preaching, he was not ſatisfied with his own pains, but when he ſaw them break forth into tears, then he rejoyced, as thinking his labours had ſorted
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97700:45"/>
to their due effect. I have heard ſome preachers that have affected a pleaſantneſs of diſcourſe in their Sermons, and never think they have done well, but when they ſee their hearers ſmile at their expreſſions; But here, I have ſaid of laughter, thou art mad, and of mirth what doeſt thou? Surely jiggs at a Funeral, and laughter at a Sermon, are things prodigiouſly unſeaſonable: It will be long (my beloved) ere a merry preacher ſhall bring you to Heaven; True repentance (which is our only way thither) is a ſad and ſerious matter; It is through the valley of <hi>Bachah,</hi> that we muſt paſs to the mount of God; the man with the writers inkhorne in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> marks none in the forehead but mourners; Oh then mourne for the abominations of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ye that love the peace of it, and would be loath to ſee the ruine and deſolation of it, and your own in it, weep with them that weep, yea weep with them that ſhould weep, as our Apoſtle doth here. That which is ſaid of the Iſraelites, that they drew water in <hi>Mizpeh,</hi> and powred it out before the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.6. is by ſome interpreters taken of the plentiful water of their tears; which is ſo much the more likely, becauſe it is joyned with faſting and publick humiliation: Oh that we could put our eyes to this uſe in theſe ſad times into which we are faln, how ſoon would the heavens clear up, and bleſs us with the comfort of our long wiſhed for peace: wordly and carnal men, as they have hard hearts, ſo they have dry eyes: dry, as a Pumice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, uncapable of tears: but the tender hearts of Gods children are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lightly attended with weeping-eyes; neither can they want tears, whilſt even other men abound with ſins; though themſelves were free. And if good men ſpend their tears upon wicked wretches, how much more ought thoſe wicked ones to beſtow tears upon themſelves; it is their danger and Miſery that Gods children are affected withall, whilſt themſelves are inſenſible of both; Wo is me, could their eyes be but opened that they might ſee their own wofull condition, they could not love themſelves ſo ill, as not to bewail it; could they ſee the frownes of an angry God bent upon them, could they ſee the flames of Hell ready to receive them, they could not but diſſolve into tears of blood; Oh pitty your own ſouls, at laſt, ye obdured ſinners; be ye feelingly apprehenſive of your fearfull danger, the eminent danger of an eternal damnation; and weep day and night before that God whom ye have provoked; waſh away your ſins with the ſtreams of penitence; The fire of hell can have no power where it

findes theſe ſoveraigne waters; <hi>Bleſſed are they that weep now, for they ſhall laugh, Luc.</hi> 6.21. We have not yet done with St. <hi>Pauls</hi> tears; See I beſeech you, who were the objects of this ſorrow of his: the falſe teachers of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> the rivals and adverſaries of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Miniſtry; whether the <hi>Simonians,</hi> (that is, the Diſciples of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> as ſome have thought) or rather the Judaizing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, whom before he calls Dogs, and the Conciſion; men that were not more for Chriſt, then for <hi>Moſes</hi>: men not more falſe in opinion then foule in converſation, rebrobate perſons, ſpightful enemies to him, and the goſpel; yet even theſe are the men whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> bedewes with his many tears. So far ſhould Gods charitable Children be from deſiring, or rejoycing in the deſtruction of thoſe who profeſſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility againſt them (though even leud, and ungodly perſons) as that they ſhould make this the matter of their juſt ſorrow and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: St. <hi>Paul</hi> had a deeper inſight into the ſtate of theſe men, then we can have into any of thoſe goodlieſt men who fall into our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and enmity; for he ſaw them (as it were) in Hell already, he lookt upon them as veſſels of wrath, for he addes, whoſe end is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: yet he entertaines the thoughts of their ſinfull miſcarriages with tears; Every man can mourn for the danger, or loſs, or fall of a good man, of a friend: but to be thus deeply affected with either the ſins, or judgments of wicked perſons is incident to none but a tender and charitable heart. Gods children are of the diet of their heavenly Father, who would have all men to be ſaved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Have I any pleaſure at all that the wicked ſhall dye, ſaith the Lord God, and not that that he ſhould returne from his wayes and live? Ezec.</hi> 18.23. And to be ſure, he binds it with an oath; <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord God, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turne from his wayes and live; turne ye, turne ye from your evill wayes; for why will ye dye, O houſe of Iſrael. Ezec.</hi> 33.11. Thoſe that ſport in the ſins, and rejoyce in the perdition of their brethren, let them ſee of what ſpirit they are.

It is excellent that our Apoſtle hath in this Epiſtle the 2. Chapter v. 15. That ye may be blamleſs in the midſt of a froward and perverſe generation, among whom ye ſhine as lights in the world: Mark, if there be but light held forth in a dark night, how do the birds come flying about it, how do the eyes of men though afarr off fix upon it; when as all the ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us and it (which is all wrapped up in darkneſs) is unregarded; ſuch are, and ſuch ſhould be good men amongſt a world of wicked ones; ſo much more eminent, and eſteemed, by how much the fewer they are.

What is an handful of gainſayers upon any occaſion? We are apt to think, that the ſtream ſhould bear down all before it; <hi>Do any of the Rulers believe in him</hi>; that's argument enough: But it muſt not be ſo with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; here one is worthy to be more then a thouſand; if he be a man that orders his converſation aright, that goes upon the ſure grounds of infallible truth, though there be none other in the world beſides him that followes after righteouſneſs, that man is worthy of our mark, of our imitation; if there be but one <hi>Noah</hi> in an age (all fleſh having corrupted their wayes) it is better to follow him into the Ark, then to periſh withall the world of unbelievers: Here are theſe <hi>Many</hi> oppoſed to <hi>Us, Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi>; It is not for us to ſtand upon the fear of an imputation of ſingularity; we may not do as the moſt, but as the beſt; It was a deſperate reſolution of <hi>Rabbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>

The World is apt to make an ill uſe of multitude: On the one ſide arguing the better part by the greater: on the other ſide arguing miſchief tolerable becauſe it is abetted by many.

A true Herculean Juſtice in Governours and States is for Gyants, and Monſters; A right <hi>Sampſon</hi> is for a whole hoſt of <hi>Philiſtims</hi>; The Mountains muſt be touch't till they ſmoak, yea till they be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel'd. Set your faces ye that are men in authority againſt a whole
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97700:47"/>
faction of vice; and if ye finde many oppoſites, the greater is the exerciſe of your fortitude, and the greater ſhall be the glory of your victory. It was St. <hi>Pauls</hi> encouragment (that which would have diſheartned ſome other) a large door and effectuall is opened to me, and there are many adverſaries, 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 16.9. And if theſe Divels can ſay, <hi>My Name is Legion for we are many</hi>; let your pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull commands caſt them out, and ſend them with the ſwine into the deep, and thence into their chaines.</p>
                  <p>Theſe many ſit not ſtill, but <hi>walk,</hi> they are ſtill in motion: Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whether natural or voluntary; Natural, ſo walking is living (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) Thus we walk even while we ſit, or lye ſtill: Every minute is a new pace; neither can any thing ſtop our paſſage; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we do ſomething or nothing, we move on by inſenſible ſteps toward our long home; we can no more ſtand ſtill then the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, then time. Oh that we could be ever looking to the houſe of our age: and ſo walk on, in this vale of tears, that we may once reſt for ever. Voluntary, ſo the wicked ones walk like their ſetter the Devil, <hi>who came from compaſſing the Earth, Job.</hi> 1. Wickedneſs is ſeldom other then active. It is with evill as with the contagion of Peſtilence, thoſe that are tainted long to infect others; Falſe Teachers make no ſpare of their Travails by Sea or Land to make a <hi>Proſelite</hi>: Could Sin or Hereſie be conjured into a circle, there were the leſſe danger; now they are ſo much more miſchievous, as they are more Erraticall: How happy ſhould it be ſince they will needs be walking, that by the holy Vigilancie of power and authority, they may be ſent to walk their own rounds in the regions of darkneſs.</p>
                  <p>Yet further; <hi>walking</hi> implies an ordinary trade of life; It is not a ſtep, or one pace that can make a walk; but a proceeding on, with many ſhiftings of our feet: It is no judging of a man by ſome one action; Alas, the beſt man that is may perhaps ſtep aſide, by the importunity of a temptation, and be miſ-carried into ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious act; Can you have more pregnant inſtances then <hi>David,</hi> the man after Gods own heart, and <hi>Peter,</hi> the prime Diſciple of our Saviour; But this was not the walk of either; It was but a ſide-ſtep: their walk was in the wayes of Gods commandement, holy and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; No, look what the courſe of mens lives are, what their uſuall practiſe; and according to that judge of them; If they be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97700:47"/>
Swearers, profane Scoffers, Drunkards, Debauch't perſons, their Walk is in an ill way to a moſt fearfull end. Pitty them, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to reclaim them, and to ſtop them that they fall not into the precipice of Hell: but if their courſe of life be generally holy, and conſcionable, it is not a particular miſ-carriage that can be a juſt ground of the cenſure of an inordinate walking, which our Apoſtle paſſes here upon theſe miſ-living <hi>Philippians; Many walk.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This for their Motion; their Quality followes, <hi>Enemies to the croſſe of Chriſt</hi>; What an unuſuall expreſſion is this? Who can but hate every thing that concurs to the death of a Friend, whether Agents, or Inſtruments. And what was the Croſſe, but the Engine of the Death of him, whom if we love not beſt, we love not at all? ſurely, We love thee not, O Saviour, if we can look with any other then angry eyes, at <hi>Judas, Pilate,</hi> the Croſſe, Nayles, Speare. or what ever elſe was any way neceſſary to thy murder: They were thine enemies that raiſed thee to the Croſſe, how can they be other then thy Friends, that are enemies to that thy moſt cruell, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne crucifixion. When we conſider theſe things in themſelves, as Wood and Metall, we know they are harmleſſe: but if from what they are in themſelves, we look at them with reſpect to men, to thee, we ſoon finde why to hate, why to love them. We hate them as they were employed by men againſt thee, we love them as they were improved by thee for man: as the inſtruments of mens malice and cruelty againſt thee, we hate them: we love them as they were made by thee, the inſtruments of our redemption: Thy Croſſe was thy death: It is thy death that gives us life; ſo as therefore we cannot be at once enemies of the Croſſe, and friends of thee crucified:</p>
                  <p>As Chriſt himſelf, ſo the Croſſe of Chriſt hath many falſe friends, and even thoſe are no other then enemies; unjuſt favours are no leſs injurious then derogations; he that ſhould deify a Saint ſhould wrong him as much, as he that ſhould Divellize him; Our Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts exceed this way, in their devotions to the Croſſe; both in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multiplying, and in over-magnifying of it. Had the wood of the Croſſe grown from the day that it was firſt ſet in the Earth, till now, and borne croſſes; that which <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cyrene</hi> once bore, could not have filled ſo many carts, ſo many ſhips, as that which is now in ſeveral parts of Chriſtendom given out and adored for the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97700:48"/>
true croſſe of Chriſt; yet the bulk is nothing to the vertue aſcribed to it: The very wood (which is a ſhame to ſpeak) is by them Sainted and deifyed, who knowes not that ſtale hymne, and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable rime of

                  </p>
                  <p>Wherein the very tree is made a mediator to him, whom it bore, as very a Saviour as he that dy'd upon it. And who knowes not that by theſe <hi>Bigots,</hi> an active vertue is attributed not only to the very wood of the croſs, but to the Airie and tranſient form and repreſentation of it; A vertue of ſanctifying the creature, of expelling Divells, of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſeaſes; conceits croſſely ſuperſtitious, which the Church of <hi>England</hi> ever abhorred, never either practiſed, or countenanced; whoſe croſs was only commemorative, and commonitive, never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be any way efficacious; and therefore as far different from the Romiſh croſs, as the fatall tree of Chriſt from that of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>; Away then with this groſs and ſinfull foppery of our Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts; which proves them not the friends but the flatterers of the Croſs; flatterers up to the very pitch of Idolatry; and can there be a worſe enemy then a flatterer? Fie on this fawning, and crouching hoſtility to the croſſe of Chriſt; ſuch friendſhip to the altar is a defiance to the ſacrifice.</p>
                  <p>For theſe <hi>Philippian Pſeudapoſtles</hi>; Two wayes were they ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Croſs of Chriſt; in their doctrines, in their practiſe. In Doctrine; whiles they joyned circumciſion, and other legalities with the croſs of Chriſt; ſo by a pretended partnerſhip detracting from the vertue and power of Chriſts death: Thus they were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Chriſts death as this; In practiſe, following a looſe and voluptuous courſe, pampering themſelves, and ſhifting off perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Goſpell; Thus they were enemies to the croſs of Chriſt, as theirs: Truth hath ever one face: There are ſtill two ſorts of enemies to the croſs; The <hi>erroneous,</hi> the <hi>licentious</hi>; The <hi>erroneous</hi> in judgment, that will be inter-commoning with Chriſt in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and efficacy of his paſſion; The licentious in life; that deſpiſe and annihilate it. In the firſt, how palpable enemies are they to the croſs of Chriſt, that hold Chriſts ſatisfaction upon the croſs imperfect without ours: Thus the Romiſh Doctors profeſs to do; Their Cardinall paſſes a flat <hi>non expiat</hi> upon it, boldly: <hi>Tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem poenam totam niſi propria ſatisfactione cooperante non expiat. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de

                  <p>The licentious, ſecondly, are enemies to the croſs of Chriſt; and thoſe of two ſorts; whether carnall revolters, or looſe-livers; The firſt, in ſhifting off perſecution, by conforming themſelves to the preſent world; they will do any thing rather then ſuffer; caring more for a whole skin, then a ſound ſoul; Meere ſlaves of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whoſe poeſie is that of <hi>Optatus; Omnia pro tempore, nihil pro veritate</hi>; All for the time, nothing for the Truth.

I do not ſend you to the Spaniſh trade, or Italian travails, or <hi>Spa-waters,</hi> The tentative Edict of <hi>Conſtantius</hi> deſcryed many falſe hearts; And the late relaxation of penall laws for religion diſcovered many a turn-coat; God keep our great men upright, if they ſhould ſwerve it is to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the truth would find but a few friends: Bleſſed be God; the times profeſſe to patronize true religion; If the winde ſhould turn, how many with that noted time-ſerver would be ready to ſay, <hi>Cantemus domino,</hi> &amp;c. let us ſing unto the Lord a new ſong.

There is no Church lightly without his wethercock: For us, my beloved, we know not what we are reſerved for; let us ſit down, and count what it may coſt us; and as thoſe who would carry ſome great weight upon a wager, will be every day heaving at it to inure themſelves to the burden, before they come to their utmoſt tryall, ſo let us do to the croſs of Chriſt: let us be every day lifting at it in our thoughts, that when the time comes we may comfortably go away with it; It was a good purpoſe of <hi>Peter,</hi> though I ſhould dye with thee I will not deny thee; but it was a better grounded reſolution of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> I am ready not to be bound only, but alſo to dye for the name of the Lord Jeſus, Act. 21.13. Let us in an humble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of Gods mercy in upholding us fix upon the ſame holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination; not counting our life dear unto us, ſo as we may finiſh our courſe with joy. Thus we ſhall not be more friends to the croſſe of Chriſt, then the croſſe will be to us, for if we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo reign with him.</p>
                  <p>Beſides carnall revolters, looſe livers powre ſhame upon the croſſe. Chriſts croſſe is our redemption, Redemption is from ſin, and death; whiles therefore we do wilfully ſin, we do (what in us lies) fruſtrate the croſs, and make a mock of our redemption; every true Chriſtian is with St. <hi>Paul</hi> crucified together with Chriſt 2. Galat. 20. his ſins are faſtned upon that tree of ſhame and curſe with his Saviour, the miſ-living Chriſtian therefore crucifies Chriſt again; each of his willing ſins is a plain deſpight to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer; The falſe tongue of a profeſſour gives in evidence againſt the Son of God: the hypocrite condemns Chriſt, and waſhes his hands; the proud man ſtrips him, and robes him with purple: the diſtruſtfull plats thornes for the head of his Saviour; the drunkard gives him vineger and gall to drink, the oppreſſor drives nailes into his hands and feet; the blaſphemer wounds him to the heart; wo is me, what an heavy caſe are theſe men in? we cannot but think thoſe that offered this bodily violence to the Son of God were highly impious, Oh, thou ſayeſt, I would not have been one of them that ſhould have done ſuch a fact for all the world: but, O man, know thou, that if thou be a wilfull ſinner againſt God in theſe kindes, thou art worſe then they: He that prayed for his firſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifiers, curſeth his ſecond; they crucified him in his weakneſſe; theſe in his glory: they fetcht him from the garden to his croſſe;

theſe pull him out of heaven; ſurely, they cannot be more enemies to the croſſe of Chriſt, then Chriſt is to them; who by him ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power, 2 <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 1.9. as it alſo followes in my Text, <hi>whoſe end is deſtruction.</hi>

Killing is nothing to deſtroying; the body is but meer rubbiſh to the ſoul; and therefore (to put theſe together) killing the body is nothing to deſtruction of the ſoul; Alas, here is every circumſtance that may add horrour and miſery to a condition; <hi>ſuddainneſſe</hi> of ſeizure, <hi>degree</hi> of extremity, <hi>impoſſibility</hi> of releaſe; ſuddainneſs; <hi>They ſhall ſoon be cut down as the graſſe,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſ.</hi> 37.2. yea, yet ſooner then ſo; <hi>as the fire licks up the straw, Eſa.</hi> 5.24. and more ſuddainly yet; as the <hi>Whrilewind paſſeth, ſo is the wicked no more, Prov.</hi> 10.25.

                  <p>AS if my tongue and your ears could not eaſily be diſwonted from our late Parliamentary language; you have here in this text Liberty, Prerogative, the maintenance of both; Liberty of Subjects that are freed; Prerogative of the King of glory that hath freed them; maintenance of that liberty, which the power of that great prerogative hath atchieved; Chriſtian liberty, Chriſts li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, our perſiſtence; <hi>Stand faſt in the Liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made you free.</hi>

                  <p>There is a drunken liberty of the Tongue, which being once glibbed with intoxicating liquor runs wilde through Heaven and earth, and ſpares neither him that is God above; nor thoſe which are called Gods on Earth; the Slanderer anſwer'd <hi>Pirrhus</hi> well; I confeſs I ſaid thus, O King; and had ſaid more if more Wine had been given me; treaſon is but a Tavern-dialect; Any thing paſſes well under the Roſe; it is not the man but the liquor, not the liquor but the exceſſe that is guilty of this liberty.</p>

Every thing is good to theſe men ſave the preſent, and nothing ſave their own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though all theſe are not ſo much liberties, as licentiouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe, there are civill liberties of Perſons, Towns, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporations,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97700:51"/>
Countries, Kings, Kingdomes; good reaſon theſe ſhould be mutually ſtood upon; Religion was never an enemy to the due orders, and rights of policy; Gods book is the true <hi>Magna charta</hi> that enacts both King and People their own: He that hath ſet bounds to the wide Ocean, hath ſtinted the freeſt liberty; but theſe liberties are not for the pulpit; It is the Chriſtian liberty wherewith we have to do; that alone hath ſcope enough both for our preſent ſpeech and perpetual maintenance.</p>
                  <p>This Chriſtian liberty ſtands either in immunity from evill, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement to good; The immunitie is from that which is evill in it ſelf, or that which is evill to us: In it ſelf, Sin, Satan: Sin, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the fault, or in the puniſhment; the puniſhment, whether inward, or outward: Inward, the ſlavery of an accuſing conſcience; Outward, the wrath of God, Death, Damnation. Evill to us, whether burdenſome traditions, or the law; the Law, whether Moral, or Ceremoniall; Moral, whether the obligations, or the curſe: Enlargement to good; whether in reſpect of the creature, which is our free uſe of it, or whether in reſpect to God; in our voluntary ſervice of him; in our free acceſſe to him: Acceſſe whether to his throne of grace, or our throne of glory. I have laid before you a compendious tablet of our Chriſtian liberty; leſſe then which is bondage; more then which is looſeneſſe. Such abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſcope there is in this allowed freedom, that what heart ſoever would yet rove further, makes it ſelf unworthy of pitty in looſing it ſelf. Do we think the Angels are pent up in their Heavens, or can wiſh to walk beyond thoſe glorious bounds? Can they hold it a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, that they can but will good; like to our liquorous firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents that longed to know evil? Oh the ſweet and happy liberty of the ſons of God? All the world beſides them are very ſlaves, and lye obnoxious to the bolts, fetters, ſcourges of a ſpiritual cruelty; It is hard to beat this into a carnall heart; no ſmall part of our ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude lyes in the captivation of our underſtanding; ſuch, as that we cannot ſee our ſelves captive. This is a ſtrange difference of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon; the Chriſtian is free, and cannot think himſelf ſo; the the worldling thinks himſelf free, and is not ſo. What talk we to theſe Jovialiſts? It is liberty (with them) for a man to ſpeak what he thinks, to take what he likes, to do what he liſts; without reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, without controlment: Call ye this freedom, that a man muſt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97700:52"/>
ſpeak and live by rule; to have a guard upon his lips and his eyes; no paſſage for a vain word or look, much leſs for a leud; to have his beſt pleaſures ſtinted, his worſe abandoned; to be tasked with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing good, and chid when he fails. Tuſh, tell not me; To let the heart looſe to an unlimited jollity, to revell heartily, to feaſt without fear, to drink without meaſure, to ſwear without check, to admit of no bound of luxury, but our own ſtrength; to ſhut out all thoughts of ſcrupulous auſterity, to entertain no gueſt of inward motion, but what may ſooth up our lawleſneſs.

Thoſe though fettered up in chains of everlaſting darkneſs can do no other but ſin; theſe in all the elbow-room of the Empyreal heaven cannot do one evill act; yea the God of Saints and Angels, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all liberty ſhould be leaſt free, who out of the bleſſed neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his moſt pure nature is not capable of the leaſt poſſibility of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill. Learn, O vain men, that there is nothing but impotence, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but gieves and manicles in the freeſt ſins; ſome captive may have a longer chain then his fellowes; yea ſome offender may have the liberty of the Tower, yet he is a priſoner ſtill. Some Goal may be wider then ſome Palace: what of that? If Hell were more ſpacious then the ſeat of the bleſſed, this doth not make it no place of torment. Go whether thou wilt, thou reſolved ſinner, thou car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieſt thy chain with thee; it ſhall ſtick as cloſe to thee as thy ſoul; neither can it ever be ſhaken off, till thou have put off thy ſelf by a ſpiritual regeneration, then only thou art free.</p>

                  <p>Here is the glorious prerogative of the Son of God, to be the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer or redeemer of his people; They could not free themſelves; the Angels of heaven might pitty, could not redeem them; yea alas, who could, or who did redeem thoſe of their rank, which of lightſome celeſtiall ſpirits, are become foul Devils? Only Chriſt could free us, whoſe ranſome was infinite; only Chriſt did free us, whoſe love is infinite; and how hath he wrought our liberty? By force, by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, By force in that he hath conquer'd him, whoſe captives we were; by purchaſe, in that he hath pay'd the full price of our ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, to that ſupream hand whereto we were forfeited: I have heard Lawers ſay, there are in civill Corporations three wayes of freedom; by Birth, by Service, by Redemption; By Birth, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was free of <hi>Rome</hi>; by Service, as Apprentiſes upon expiration of their years; by Redemption, as the the Centurion, <hi>with a great ſum pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed I this freedom.</hi> Two of theſe are barred from all utter poſſibility in our ſpiritual freedom; for by Birth we are the ſons of wrath; by ſervice we are naturally the vaſſals of Satan; It is only the precious redemption of the Son of God that hath freed us.</p>
                  <p>Whereas freedom then hath reſpect to bondage, there are ſeven Egyptian Maſters from whoſe ſlavery Chriſt hath freed us.

                  <p>Our laſt Maſter is humane Ordinances; the caſe of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption where from is not ſo clear; concerning which I finde a double extream of opinion; The one that aſcribes too much to them, as equalling them with the law of God; the other that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes too little to them, as if they were no tie to our obedience: The one holding them to bind the conſcience no leſs then the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive laws of God; the other either ſleighting their obligation, or extending it only to the outward man, not the inward: we muſt learn to walk a mid-way betwixt both; and know that the good lawes of our ſuperiours, whether civill or eccleſiaſtical, do in a ſort reach to the very conſcience; though not primarily and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately as theirs, yet mediately and ſecondarily as they ſtand in reference to the law of God with our obedience to his inſtituted au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and therefore they tie us in ſome ſort beſides the caſe whether of ſcandall, or contempt. Where no man can witneſs, there is no ſcandall; where is no intention of an affront to the commanding power, there is no contempt, and yet willingly to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97700:54"/>
break good Iaws without all witneſs, without all purpoſe of affront is therfore ſin becauſe diſobedience; For example, I dine fully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone out of wantonneſſe, upon a day ſequeſtred by authority to a publick faſt; I dine alone, therefore without ſcandall; out of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe, therefore not out of contempt; yet I offend againſt him that ſeeth in ſecret, notwithſtanding my ſolitarineſſe, and my wantonneſſe is by him conſtrued as a contempt to the ordainer of authority. But when both ſcandall and contempt are met to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the violation, now the breach of humane lawes binds the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to a fearfull guilt. Not to flatter the times, (as I hope I ſhall never be blurred with this crimination) I muſt needs ſay this is too ſhamefully unregarded; Never age was more lawleſſe; Our fore-fathers were taught to be ſuperſtitiouſly ſcrupulous in obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the lawes of the Church, above Gods; like thoſe Chriſtians of whom <hi>Socrates</hi> the hiſtorian ſpeaks of, which held fornication as a thing indifferent, <hi>de diebus feſtis tanquam de vita decertant,</hi> but ſtrive for an holy day as for their life; we are leapt into a licentious neglect of civill or ſacred lawes, as if it were piety to be diſobedient. Doth the law command a Friday faſt; no day is ſo ſelected for feaſting; let a ſchiſmaticall or popiſh book be prohibited, this very prohibition endears it; let wholſome lawes be enacted againſt drunkenneſſe, idleneſſe, exactions, unlawfull tranſportations, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of diet, of apparell, or what ever noted abuſe: commands do not ſo much whet our deſires, as forbiddances: what is this but to baffle and affront that ſacred power which is entruſted to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and to profeſſe our ſelves not <hi>Libertines,</hi> but <hi>licentiate</hi> of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order. Farr, farr is it from the intentions of the God of order, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſtile of liberty to give ſcope to theſe unruly humors of men; the iſſue whereof can be no other then utter confuſion. But if any power (beſides divine) in Heaven or Earth ſhall challenge to it ſelf this priviledg, to put a primary, or immediate tie upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſo as it ſhould be a ſin to diſobey that ordinance, becauſe 'tis without relation to the command of the higheſt, let it be <hi>anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>; our hearts have reaſon to be free in ſpight of any ſuch Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian uſurpation, whiles the owner of them hath charged us, not to be (<hi>thus) the ſervants of men</hi> 1 Cor. 7.23. ſo Chriſt hath laſtly freed us from the bondage of humane ordinances.</p>
                  <p>Lo now ye have ſeen our liberation from a whole heptarchy of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97700:55"/>
ſpirituall tyranny; Stand ſtill now awhile, Honourable and beloved, and look back with wondring and thankfull eyes upon the infinite mercy of our deliverer; ſin beguiles us, conſcience accuſeth us, Gods wrath is bent againſt us, Satan tyrannizes over us, the law condemnes us, inſolent ſuperſtition inthralls us, and now from all theſe Chriſt hath made us free. How ſhould we now erect altars to our dear Redeemer, and inſcribe them <hi>Chriſto liberatori</hi>; how ſhould we from the altars of our devoted hearts, ſend up the holy ſacrifices of our beſt obediences, the ſweet incenſe of our perpetuall prayers.

To ſumme up all then; we are freed from the bondage of ſin by the ſpirit of Chriſt; from an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing conſcience by the blood of Chriſt, from the wrath of God by faith in Chriſt, from the tyranny of Satan by the victory of Chriſt; from the curſe of the law by the ſatisfaction of Chriſt; from the law of ceremonies by the conſummation of Chriſt; from humane ordinances by the manumiſſion and inſtruction of Chriſt; and now ſtand faſt in all theſe liberties wherewith Chriſt hath made you free; And ſo from the liberty, and prerogative, we deſcend to the maintenance of this liberty, <hi>Stand faſt.</hi>

                  <p>Do we then obey the filthy luſts of our brutiſh ſenſuality, how high ſoever we look, we are but vaſſals: and our ſervitude is ſo much more vile, as our maſter is more deſpicable: A Princes vaſſal may think himſelf as good as a poor free-man, but a ſlaves ſlave goes in rank with a beaſt; ſuch is every one that endrudgeth himſelf to any known ſin. In whoſe eyes a vile perſon is contemned; ſaith the Pſalmiſt: A vile perſon, who is that? Be not deceived, it is not the habits that makes a man vile, but the conditions. No rags can make the good man other then glorious; no robe can make the leud man other then baſe; when we ſee and hear of high titles, rich coates, antient houſes, long pedegrees, glittering ſuites, large re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, we honour theſe (and ſo we muſt do) as the juſt monuments, ſignes, appendances of civill greatneſs; but let me tell you withall; the eyes of God, his Saints, and Angels look upon any of you as a vile perſon, if his ſin be his Maſter: as they ſay of <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh, that he was the ſlave of his Phyſitian <hi>Corterius,</hi> but a tirant to others; ſo nothing hinders but that ye may be the commanders of others, and yet (the while) vaſſals to your own corruptions.

                  <p>IF ye mark it, your very Calender, ſo as the wiſdom of the Church hath contrived it, is a notable Catechiſm.

                  <p>I ſhall not over-labour to reduce the Text to the day? Fire and light have ſo near affinity that they are ſcarce ever ſeparated; The ſame Spirit of God who appeared as this day in the ſhape of fierie tongues to the diſciples may be now pleaſed by my tongue to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt himſelf to your ſouls in light: And as that fire was very light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, elſe it could not have been ſeen in the day-time; ſo may this exhibition of light be accompanied with a fire of holy zeal both in my tongue, and your hearts. In my laſt Sermon at the Court I gave you the Character of man, I ſhall now indeavour to give you ſome touches of the Character of God;</p>
                  <p>There is nothing in this world ſo much concerns a man as to ſettle his heart in a right apprehenſion of his God; which muſt be the ground of all his piety and devotion; without which all his pretenſes of Religion are ſo nothing worth, as that in them, God is made our Idoll, and we the miſ-worſhippers of him; without which ſhortly, our whole life is miſ-ſpent in error and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and ends in a miſerable diſcomfort: Whence it is that this dear diſciple makes it the ſumm of all the Apoſtolicall miſſion, which he had from his Lord and Saviour, to informe the World what to think of God; This then is the meſſage which we have heard of him, and declare to you, that <hi>God is light.</hi> Would ye know the meſſage which the Apoſtles received from Chriſt; would ye know the meſſage which they delivered from Chriſt to the World, it is in theſe three ſyllables of my Text. <hi>God is light.</hi>

Far be it from us that according to the ſtupidity of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> we ſhould take this literally of a ſenſible and materiall Light; that is but a creature, though indeed the firſt, and exceeding glorious, but yet a creature, and therefore infinitely below the purity and perfection of the Creator; but ſure God would have us by this to be led to the conceit of the tranſcendent glory of his incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible Deity; and would have us when we think of him to be put in mind of admiring an increated, immateriall, ſuper-intelligible uprightneſſe of a glory, ſo much above all ſpiritual natures, as the Light is above the bodily and viſible; whereupon it is that when the ſpirit of God by his Apoſtle deſcribes the habitation of God, he doth it in theſe termes that he dwells in a Light that none can approach unto; and when he deſcribes the Heaven of the elect,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16.</note> he calls it, the inheritance of the Saints in Light; ſo as when that place of bliſſe, and the God whoſe preſence makes it ſuch, come into our thoughts,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.12.</note> we muſt elevate our thoughts above this dark ſphere of mortality; and repreſent unto our ſelves a glorious light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſſe, as much above this materiall Light, as Light is above Darkneſſe; abandoning that gloomie and baſe opacity of conceit, wherewith our earthly mindes are commonly wont to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded; for ſurely it is eaſie and familiar to obſerve, that the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97700:59"/>
higher we go, the more Light we ſhall find; In the center of the Earth there is nothing but perfect darkneſſe; nearer the upper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of that great body where any overture is made; there is a kind of imperfect twilight; In this lower air there is a better Light, but mixed with foggs and Vapors, In the higher regions, there are leſſe miſts, and more clearneſſe, yet not without ſome dimneſs of exhalations; In the ſtarry Heavens, a purer Light, yet not without ſome eclipſes; In the empyreall, nothing but pure and perfect Light; juſtly therefore are our hearts lift up with our eyes to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of a Light above thoſe Heavens more pure and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then theirs. Away then with all dull and darkſome imaginations when we addreſſe our ſelves to the throne of Grace; and let us adore an infinite Spirit dwelling in an unacceſſible Light, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with millions of Angels of Light, and glorified ſpirits of his Saints in a Light unſpeakable and glorious; this ſhall be the firſt glimpſe of our inlightned underſtanding when we would comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly appear before God; In which regard I fear many of us Chriſtians are much defective in our holy devotions, ſpeaking unto God, and thinking of him, ſullenly and ſadly, as ſhut up in ſome remote and unknown darkneſſe on the other ſide of the World, or at leaſt without the lively apprehenſion of that wonderfull radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of glory wherewith he is inveſted; miſconceiving herein of that Deity whom we implore; who hath revealed himſelf unto us by the name of Light.</p>
                  <p>And ſurely, as none but an <hi>Eagle</hi> can look upon the Light of the Sun; ſo none but the confirmed eyes of an illuminated Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian can behold God in this notion of his celeſtiall ſplendor; which we muſt ſo labour to attain unto, and ſettle in our minds, as that we ſhould no more think of the bleſſed Deity without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of an infinite reſplendence, then we can open our eyes at noon-day without an incurrence and admiſſion of an outward Light.</p>
                  <p>But this, how ever requiſite to be conceived, and done, is not the main drift of our Apoſtle; who goes not about here ſo much to make any deſcription of God, or preſcription of the wayes of our underſtanding, or repreſentation of his glorious preſence, as to lay the grounds of our holy diſpoſition, and pure and Heavenly carriage before him: For ſo is the Light here affirmed of God, as
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97700:59"/>
the darkneſs is diſavowed of him; and both of them are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned with an intention of drawing in an exhortation to that purity which we ſhould affect and the avoydance of all the ſtate and works of ſpirituall darkneſs which we ſhould abhorre. God then is Light, as in himſelf, ſo in relation to us; and this predication of Light ſerves to inferre our conformity to God in this behalf: It is not for us therefore to inquire ſo much into thoſe abſolute termes wherein God ſtands with himſelf, as what he is in pattern unto us: Thus is he Light, either qualita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, or cauſatively;</p>
                  <p>The Light hath a quality (for it matters not to ſearch into the eſſence of it, and indeed, it is more then we can do to find it out) of clearneſſe, of purity: Of clearneſs for the uſe of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation; Of purity, and untaintedneſs in reſpect of any mixture of corruption; In both theſe is God Light. Cauſatively in that he is the Authour of all Light; communicating it to his Creatures in what kind ſoever; not without reference to the diffuſive quality of Light in the illuminating of this vaſt body, and dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it ſelf to all the World in an inſtant: In theſe three regards therefore is God Light here; 1. Of abſolute clearneſs in his infinite knowledg and wiſdom. 2. Of exact purity in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect rectitude of his will. 3. Of gracious diffuſion, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating of himſelf to his Creatures, and to us in ſpeciall; ſo, as to inlighten us with competent knowledg in our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſincere diſpoſition of our will and affections; And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is thus Light, all that will claim to partake of him, muſt be in their meaſure, clear in underſtanding, pure in will and affections, diffuſive of their knowledg and graces to others.</p>
                  <p>Theſe three qualities of clearneſs, purity, diffuſion, together with three anſwerable reflections upon us ſhall be the matter of our following diſcourſe, and challenge your beſt attention,</p>
                  <p>Thoſe things which (whether in nature or art) are wont to paſs for the carriages of Light have in them ſometimes, at leaſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of our ſight, ſome kind of dimneſs and opacity. The can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle hath his ſnuffe, the fire his ſmoke, and blackneſs of indigeſtion, the Moon her ſpots, the very Sun it ſelf, his Eclipſes; Neither is it ſaid that God is lightſome, but light it ſelf in the abſtract, then which nothing can be convinced more clear, and piercing; and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97700:60"/>
therefore it is purpoſely added for the further Emphaſis, <hi>In him is no darkeneſſe</hi>; Oh the infinite clearneſſe of the Divine knowledg, to which all things lye open, both paſt, preſent, and to come; which doth not only reach in one intuition to all the actions, moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, events of all Creatures that have been, are, ſhall be; but which is infinitely more then all theſe, extends to the full comprehenſion of himſelf, his whole Divine nature and eſſence; to which the World (though full of innumerable varieties) is leſſe then nothing: The Sun is a goodly globe of Light; The viſible World hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo glorious, ſo ſearching; and yet there are many things lye hid within the boſome of the Earth and Sea which his eye never ſaw, never ſhall ſee; Neither can it ever ſee more then half the World at once; darkneſs the while enwraps the other; nor indeed of any much leſſer (if round) body; And though it give light unto other Creatures, yet it gives not light to it ſelf; like as our eye ſees all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther objects, but it ſelf it cannot ſee. And though it enlighten this materiall Heaven both above and below it ſelf, as alſo this lower Air and Earth, yet the Empyreal Heaven tranſcends the beames of it, and is filled with a more glorious illumination: But, God, the Light of whom we ſpeak, who is the Maker of that Sun, ſees the moſt hidden ſecrets of Earth and Hell; ſees all that is done in Earth and Heaven at one view; ſees his moſt glorious ſelf; and by his preſence makes Heaven. Moſt juſtly therefore is God Light, by an eminence.</p>
                  <p>Now the reflection of the firſt quality of Light upon us, muſt be our clear apprehenſion of God, the World, and our ſelves; and by how much more exact knowledg we ſhall attain unto of all theſe, by ſo much more do we conform our ſelves to that God who is Light: and by how much leſs we know them, ſo much more darkneſs there is in us, and ſo much leſs fellowſhip have we with God; If the eye have not an inward Light in it ſelf, let the Sun ſhine never ſo bright upon it, it is nevertheleſs blind, What are we the better for that which is in God, if there be not an inward Light in our Souls to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer and receive it? How ſhould we love and adore God if we know him not? How ſhall we hate and combat the World, if we know it not? How ſhall we value and demean our ſelves, if we know not our ſelves? Surely the want of this Light of knowledg is the ground of all that miſerable diſorder which we ſee daily break
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97700:60"/>
forth in the affections, in the carriages of men. I know the common word is, that we are fallen into a knowing age; ſuch as wherein our ſpeculative skill is wont to be upbraided to us, in a diſgracefull compariſon of our unanſwerable practiſe; our forward young men out-run their years, &amp; bragg that there is more weight in the down of their chins then in the gray beards of their aged Grandſires; Our artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers take upon them to hold argument with, and perhaps control their Teachers; neither is it any newes for the ſhop-board to conteſt with the ſchooles, every not Knight, or Rook only, but Pawn too, can give check to a Biſhop; The Romiſh Church had lately her Shee-Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, till Pope <hi>Urban</hi> gagg'd them; and our Goſſips now at home, in ſtead of dreſſes, can tattle of myſteries, and cenſure the Pulpit in ſtead of neighbours: Light call you this? No theſe are fiery flaſhes of conceit, that glance through vain minds to no purpoſe, but idle oſtentation, and ſatisfaction of wild humours, without ſtability, or any available efficacy to the ſoul: Alas we are wiſe in impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; ignorant in main truths; neither doth the knowledg of too many go any deeper then the verge of their brains, or the tip of their tongue: I fear true ſolid knowledg is not much leſs rare, then when our unlett'red Grand-fathers were wont to court God Almighty with falſe Latin in their devotions; For did the true Light ſhine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hearts of men in the knowledg of God, the World, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, how could they, how durſt they live thus. Durſt the leud tongues of men rend the holy name of God in peices with oaths and blaſphemies, if they knew him to be ſo dreadfull, ſo juſt, as he hath revealed himſelf? Durſt the cruell oppreſſors of the World grind faces, and cut throats, and ſhed blood like water, if they were perſwaded that God is a ſure revenger of their outrages? Durſt the goatiſh adulterer, the ſwiniſh drunkard wallow in their beaſtly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe, if they knew their is a God to judge them, an Hell to fry in? Durſt the rebellious ſeditionary lift up his hand againſt the Lords Anointed; and that under a colour of religion, if the fool had not ſaid in his heart, <hi>There is no God?</hi> Could the covetous fool ſo admire and adore his red and white Earth? could the ambitious ſo dote upon a little vaniſhing honour, as to ſacrifice his ſoul to it, if he knew the World? could the proud man be ſo beſotted with ſelf-love, as that he ſees his God in his glaſs, if he knew himſelf?

None but ſavage Creatures delight in darkneſs; Man naturally abhorres it in all things; If our eyes be dim, we call for glaſſes, if our houſes be dark, we make windows, if the evening grow dark we call for lights, and if thoſe lights burn dim, we call for ſnuffers, and ſhall we avoid darkneſs in every thing, except our ſoules, which is our better, and more Divine part? Honourable, and beloved, as we love and tender thoſe dear ſoules of ours, let us labour to furniſh them with the Light of true and ſaving knowledg; What is this Goſpell which ſhines thus daily and clearly in your faces, but the <hi>Vehiculum lucis</hi> the carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of that heavenly Light to the World; <hi>Send forth thy Light and thy Truth,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt. <hi>Thy Word is Truth,</hi> ſaith our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; that word of truth then is the body of that Light which God ſhowes to men: Oh let it not ſhine upon us in vain; let us not trample upon the beams of it in our floore, as that fooliſh woman that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks of, did to thoſe of the Sun, with a <hi>Calco Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorum Deum.</hi> But now, while God gives theſe happy opportunities, let us enlarge our hearts to receive it with all joy and thankfulneſſe: And if <hi>Moſes</hi> by conferring with God but 40 Dayes and Nights in the delivery of the law, had a glorious brightneſſe in his face; Oh let us that more then fourty years have had converſation with God in his Goſpell ſhine with the reſplendent beames of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowledg; And if the joyes of heaven are deſcribed by Light, ſurely the more lightſome our ſoules are here, the nearer they come to their bleſſedneſſe. <hi>Light is ſown from the righteous,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt; Lo here is the ſeed-time of Light, above, is the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt: If the Light of ſaving knowledg be ſown in our hearts here, we ſhall be ſure to reap the crop of heavenly glory hereafter. And this is the firſt quality of Light with the reflection of it upon us. The next followes which is purity.</p>

pure and ſimple as the light; it diſcovers all the foulneſſe of the moſt earthly recrements, it mixeth with none of them, neither is poſſibly capable of the leaſt corruption; ſome of the beſt Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters therefore have taken this metaphor of Light to implie the purity and perfect goodneſs of God; In whom as there is an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite clearneſſe of underſtanding, ſo alſo an infinite rectitude of will; in ſo much as his will is the rule of all right; neither doth he will ought becauſe it is good, but therefore it is good becauſe he wills it. Goodneſſe hath no leſſe brightneſſe in it then truth, and wickedneſs as it is never without errour, ſo it is no leſſe dark then it; Juſtly therefore is God all light, in that he is all pure and good; and the reflection of this quality upon us muſt be our holineſs; For this is the will of God even our ſanctification; The more holy then we are, the more we conform to him that is Light; <hi>The way of the juſt is as the ſhining Light, that ſhineth more and more</hi>; as contrarily; ſins are the works of darkneſs, the mover of them is the Prince of darkneſſe the agents of them are the Sons of darkneſſe, and their trade is walking in darkneſſe, (as it followes in my text) and the end of them is utter darkneſs. Whiles he ſayes then, Be Holy as I am Holy, he doth as good as ſay, Be ye Light as I am Light; Ye were dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but now (it is Gods own phraſe) <hi>Lux estis, ye are Light in the Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>St. Paul</hi> to his Epheſians; juſtly therefore doth it follow walk as children of the Light; In right wayes, with ſtraight ſtepps: And ſurely if God be Light, and we darkneſs, what intereſt can we claim in him? <hi>For what communion is there betwixt Light and darkneſs.</hi> Oh the comfortable and happy condicion then of thoſe that are in God, they are ſtill in Light; <hi>Truly the light is ſweet,</hi> ſaith wiſe <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and a pleaſant thing it is for the eyes to behold the Sun</hi>; As on the contrary it is a wofull and diſconſolate eſtate to live in any ſin; this is no other then to be dungeon'd up in a perpetuall darkneſſe; The Egyptians were even weary of themſelves for a three dayes dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; how irkſome had it been to have lived alwayes ſo?

that no man could ſee his hand in it; that the inhabitants of the borders of it might hear many times in the woods, the noiſe of men crying, of horſes neighing, of cocks crowing, but no man durſt venture to go unto it, becauſe he could not find the way out again; which he ſaies with much earneſtneſſe that he ſaw; <hi>Neque Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſem,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>niſi propriis oculis perſpexiſſem</hi>; reporting it to have been a miraculous judgment upon ſome <hi>Perſian</hi> perſecutors of the Chriſtians in that place: I liſt not to inquire into the likelyhood of the ſtory; it might be ſome temporary judgment (as that was upon <hi>Egypt</hi> for the time) and now long ſince vaniſhed; but imagine ye the truth of that which he dares with ſo deep proteſtations avow; and conceive the condicion of all wilfull ſinners; who live ſhut up in a region of thick darkneſs; whence they can no more get out, then they can be capable of any comfort within; and when they have wearied themſelves in thoſe wretched mazes of vanity, they are ſhut up in the utter darkneſſe of the dreadfull pit of eternall Death. Oh then that willing ſinners, be they never ſo gay and glorious, could but apprehend the miſery and horrour of their own eſtate in this behalf, certainly it were enough to make them either maz'd, or penitent. For what is darkneſſe but a privation of Light? Now God is Light; And ſin deprives us of Gods preſence and ſhuts us out from the face of God; and if in his preſence be the fulneſſe of joy, then in his abſence is the fulneſſe of ſorrow, and torment; neither have the Schools determined amiſs, that the pain of loſs is more horrible then the pain of ſenſe; ſo as that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which our ſin cauſeth in the alienation, and abſence of the Lighr of Gods countenance is without his great mercy, the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of an utter excluſion from the beatificall face of God, and of that utter darkneſſe of hell. For us, as we profeſſe our ſelves the Children of the Light ſo let us walk in the Light: And what Light is that? <hi>Thy law is a Light to my feet, ſaith holy David</hi>; Lo this is the Light wherein we muſt walk; that ſo walking in the Light of his law, we may happily enjoy the light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,<note place="margin">

Juſtly therefore is he <hi>Pater luminum</hi> the Father of Lights; and as the child oft-times reſembles the Father, this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity the Light hath from God, that it is wondrouſly diffuſive of it ſelf; reaching forth it ſelf largely in very quick and inſtantanie motions to all thoſe things which are capable of it; Other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, though beneficiall, yet impart themſelves more ſparingly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us: The Earth yields us fruit, but it is onely perhaps once a year, and that not without much coſt and angariation, requiring both our labour, and patience; The Clouds do ſometimes drop fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but at great uncertainties; other whiles they pour down fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine upon our heads; the Sea yields us commodities both of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage and ſuſtenance, but not without inconſtancy and delaies and oft-times takes more in an hour then it gives in an age; his favours are locall, his threats univerſall; But the Light is bountifull in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing it ſelf freely with a clear, ſafe, unlimited largeſſe upon all Creatures at once, indifferently, inceſſantly, beneficially.</p>
                  <p>The reflection of this quality upon us ſhould be our diffuſiveneſſe; That we ſhould ſo be lights, as that we ſhould give light; ſo have light in our ſelves, that we ſhould give it unto others. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Daniel,</hi> who was a great Philoſopher &amp; Aſtronomer in his time, tells us of a double ſhining, or light, The one as of the Firmament, the other as of the Stars; The one a generall Light diſperſed through the whole or body of the Skie, the other a particular one, compacted into the bodies of thoſe ſtarry globes which are wont to be called the more ſolid piece of their Orbe; Thus it is in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy of the ſpirituall light There is a generall Light common to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97700:63"/>
Gods Children; whereof our Saviour; <hi>Let your Light ſhine ſo before men, that they may ſee your good works and glorify your father which is in Heaven:</hi> Thus the great Doctour of the Gentiles exhorts his <hi>Philipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>

And if in preſence his light dim, or extinguiſh yours, yet the World affords you darkneſs enough abroad to ſhine in: Oh ſhine you clearly in the dark night of this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill World, that the beholders may ſee and magnify your brightneſs, and may ſay of one; there is a <hi>Mars</hi> of truly heroical courage, there is the <hi>Mercury</hi> of ſound wiſdom and learning, there the <hi>Jupiter</hi> of exemplary honour and magnificence, there the <hi>Phoſphorus</hi> of Piety, and ante-lucan devotion; and may be accordingly ſenſible of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall influences to your Country: Far be it from any of you to be a fatall <hi>Sirius</hi> or Dog-ſtar, which when he riſes yields perhaps a little needleſs light, but withall burns up the Earth, and inflames the ayr,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:97700:63"/>
puts the World in a miſerable combuſtion; Far be it from you to be diſmall and direfull comets, that portend nothing but horrour and death to the earth; or, if your light be of a lower accenſion; far, far be it from you to be any of thoſe (<hi>ignes fatui</hi>) that do at once af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright and ſeduce the poor travailer, and carry him by leud guidance into a ditch; Such, ſuch, alas there are: give me leave to complain (where can I do it better then at a Court, the profeſſed Academy of honour?) That a ſtrange kind of looſe debauchedneſſe hath poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed too many of the young Gallants of our time (I fear I may take in both ſexes) with whom modeſty, civility, temperance, ſobriety are quite out of faſhion, as if they had been ſutes of their Grandſires wardrobe.</p>
                  <p>As for Piety and Godlineſs, they are ſo laid by, as if they were the caſt rags of a deſpiſed frippery. He is no brave Spirit with too many that bids not defiance to good orders, that revells not without care, ſpends not withour meaſure, talks not without grace, lives not without God. Wo is me, is this the fruit of ſo long and clear a Light of the Goſpel? Is this to have fellowſhip with the Divine Light? Now the God of Heaven be mercifull to that Wild and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theous licenciouſnes, wherewith the World is ſo miſerably over-run: and ſtrike our hearts with a true ſence of our grievous provocations of his name; that our ſerious humiliations, may fore-lay his too-well-deſerved judgments: In the mean time, if there ſhould be any one ſuch amongſt you that hear me this Day (as commonly they will be ſure to be fartheſt off from good counſell) let Wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> School him for me, <hi>Rejoyce O Young man in thy youth, and let thy heart chear thee up in the dayes of thy Youth, and walk in the wayes of thine heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes, but know thou that for all theſe things God will bring thee to judgment:</hi> And let me add this, if he be not for the light, he ſhall be for the fire; for the ſame Spirit of God, which tells him here that <hi>God is Light,</hi> tells him elſewhere (which he ſhall once feel, though he will not believe) that our God is a conſuming fire.</p>
                  <p>Now in the ſecond place for us of the holy Tribe, we are ſtars too: And if not Stars, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.16, Yet Candles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.13. However; Lights we muſt be, and that both in Life, and Doctrine: If the firſt, there are ſtars of ſeverall magnitudes, ſome goodly and great ones that move in Orbes of their own; others ſmall, and ſcarce vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in the Galaxy of the Church, but all are Stars, and no Star is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97700:64"/>
without ſome light: If but the Second; there are large Tapers, and Ruſh-candles, one gives a greater light then the other, but all give ſome: Never let them go for either Stars, or Candles that neither have nor give light: And wo is me, if the Light that is in us be darkneſs, how great, how dangerous is that darkneſſe. Bleſſed be God, we have a learned, able, and flouriſhing Clergy, as ever this Church had, or (I think I may boldly ſay) any other ſince the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel look't forth into the World; there have not been clearer Lamps in Gods Sanctuary ſince their firſt lighting then our dayes have ſeen; yet why ſhould we ſtick to confeſſe that which can neither be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, nor denyed, that there are ſome amongſt ſo many whoſe, wicke is too much for their Oyle, yea rather whoſe ſnuffe is more then their Light; I mean, whoſe offenſive lives ſhame their holy Doctrines, and reproach the Glorious Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; theſe as we lament, ſo we deſire to have top't by juſt cenſures; but hear you, my worthy brethren, do not you, where you ſee a thiefe in the Candle call preſently for an extinguiſher: for perſonal faults do not you condemn an holy calling: Oh be you wiſely charitable, and let us be exemplarily holy.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, for you Chriſtian hearers; think not that this Light may be put off to publick and eminent perſons only: Each of you muſt ſhine too, at the leaſt <hi>tanquam faces, Philip.</hi> 2.

So as unleſſe we will wilfully ſhut our eyes, we cannot but <hi>behold the works of the Lord</hi>: But there is more in this charge then ſo; as theſe works are not meant of the ordinary occurrents, ſo it is not a mere ſight that is here called for; but a ſerious and fixed contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation: It is not <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Wherefore hath God ſet us here on this greatſtage of the world, but that we ſhould be ſpectators of the marvailous acts that are here done.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Surely, they are worth beholding; for they are all like his; well becoming his infinite power, wiſdom, juſtice: So hath God done his wondrous works that they ought to be had in perpetuall remembrance: Beauty and excellence is abſtractive where ever it is: There is not one act of either his creation or adminiſtration wherein there is not the footſteps of an omnipotence, and an infinity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence? Every thing works according to his ability: As the man is, ſo is his ſtrength: and as his ſtrength, ſo his actions: Alas, we weak creatures produce weak and feeble, and imperfect acts, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we poſſibly do other; for ſuch as the cauſe is, ſuch muſt the effects needs be: God therefore, who is all power, juſtice, wiſdom, goodneſſe, muſt needs produce acts anſwerable to ſuch an agent: therefore <hi>behold the works of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Wherefore were our eyes given us, but for this very purpoſe they were not given us for the beholding of vanity; not for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnaring or wounding of the ſoul; but for the uſe and honour of the Creatour; and wherein is that attained, but in the <hi>beholding of the works of the Lord</hi>: hence it is that they can behold all things but themſelves; and diſcern thoſe things worſt, which are cloſeſt to them; and ſee, not by ſending forth any vertue from themſelves, but by intromitting of thoſe ſpecies which are ſent in to them; ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that God who hath made all things for himſelf, hath in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this moſt excellent and uſefull peece had an eye to his own glory in our beholding of his works; which if we neglect to do, we do, what in us lies, fruſtrate Gods purpoſe and intention in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Add to this, that the Lord delights to have his works beheld; for he knowes the excellency and perfection of them, and knowes that the more they are ſeen and noted, the more honour will accrue to the Maker of them: like as ſome skilfull <hi>Artizan</hi> (ſome exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Limner or Carver) when he hath made a Maſter-piece of his Art, he doth not hide it up in ſome dark corner where it may not be
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97700:66"/>
ſeen; but ſets it forth in the beſt light, and rejoyces to have it ſeen and admired: Thus doth the Almighty; when the Creature was firſt made becauſe there was no other eyes to ſee it, he lookt upon it with great complacency, and rejoyced in his own handywork; It being the Epiphonema to every days work when he comes to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the particularities of his workmanſhip, <hi>And God ſaw that it was good</hi>; and in a recapitulation or winding up all; <hi>God ſaw every thing that he had made; and behold, it was very good, Gen.</hi> 1.31. But when the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels were created, and ſaw the glorious handy work of God, they did preſently applaud the marvailous works of their Maker; <hi>when the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Starrs ſang together, and all the ſons of God ſhouted for joy, Job</hi> 38.7. And when after that, man was created, he joyned with thoſe glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpirits in viewing and magnifying the works of his Creatour. And ſo he ſhould do. God was well pleaſed that he ſhould do ſo. Alas we men who are conſcious to our own infirmity, let paſſe many things from us which we care not how little they are viewed and ſcanned; for we know there may be flawes found in our beſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, which at the firſt bluſh appear not; we hear ſometimes a diſcourſe, which as it paſſes through the ear ſounds well, and ſeems to carry a good ſhow of exquiſiteneſs, which if it be ſet down and come to an accurate examination, may be found defective in this point, in that redundant, here miſ-placed, there inconſequent; even courſe tapeſtry may afarr off ſhow well; which when it comes to be cloſe viewed diſcovers an homelineſſe in texture and faults enough both in ſhapes and colours: But as for the works of God, <hi>In wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hast thou made them all</hi>; ſaith the Prophet: The more they are ſcanned, and tryed the more pure and precious they will appear; and as <hi>Solomon</hi> expreſſes it, <hi>Man ſhall find nothing after him, Eccl.</hi> 7.14. And the God that knowes this, loves that we ſhould in all hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and modeſt-diligence ſearch into, <hi>and behold his works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is great reaſon that we ſhould carefully <hi>behold the works of the Lord,</hi> becauſe none but we can do it; of ſuch infinite variety of Creatures, there is none but the rationall and intelligent, <hi>viz.</hi> Angels and men, that can ſo much as take notice of what God hath done, no not of themſelves; that ſence whereby they are led cannot reach ſo high as a thought; what is before them, they ſee ſo farr as their downward eyes will reach, and make towards that which ſerves their appetite, and avoid what they apprehend may

hurt them, but as for their Maker, or for their own condicion, or their fellow Creatures, they are not capable of any glimpſe of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg thereof: And even of reaſonable Creatures, what a World is there that are as inſenſible of the works of God as if they were utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſate; Pagans, Infidels, Worldlings that are carried by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther guide then mere bruit Creatures are; and affect no other light then that of ſenſe; Alas, what is it to them what God doth, or what he doth not? How much then doth it concern us whom God hath illuminated with any meaſure of knowledg, and furniſht with any meaſure of grace to be inquiſitive into the works of God, and to give glory to him in all his actions.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This ſhall not be ſo much advantage to God (alas what can we add to the infinite?) as benefit to our ſelves: it is here as with thoſe that dig in ſome precious mine, the deeper they go, the richer they are: hence it is that the moſt contemplative have been noted for moſt eminent in grace, and ſurely it is their fault if they be not ſo; for they ſhould be the beſt acquainted with God, and with their own duty: ſhortly then, ſeeing the works of God are ſo excellent, and well-worth beholding; ſince our eyes were given us for this uſe, ſince God delights to have his works viewed; ſince there are ſo few that are capable of giving this glory to God; ſince in <hi>beholding the works of God</hi> we do moſt advantage our ſelves both in knowledg and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; let us as we are here invited, <hi>Come and behold the works of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His works; in all the variety of them; not ſome one work, but all; as the works of his creation, ſo of his adminiſtration too; the divers, yea contrary proceedings of God therein; in the changes of his favours and judgments; I confeſs there is and may be ſome one work of God ſo marvelous that it is able and worthy to take up all our thoughts; but we may not ſuffer our hearts to dwell in any one work of his, but inlarge them to more; we may not reſt in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of his mercy only, but we muſt look to his judgments; elſe we ſhall grow ſecure we may not reſt in the view of his judgments only without meet glances at his mercy, els we ſhall grow to an heartleſſe diſtruſt and deſpair; As we ſay in our philoſophy; <hi>Compoſita nutriunt,</hi> only compounds nouriſh; thoſe things which are merely ſimple can give no nutriment at all; ſo it is in ſpirituall matters, there muſt be a compoſition in thoſe objects of contemplation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we would feed and benefit our ſoules; our reſolution for our

                  </p>
                  <p>Now, that we may deſcend to the particularities; the Pſalmiſt begins at judgment. <hi>What deſolations, &amp;c.</hi> This is the right method; as in the very being of both, judgment leads the way to mercy; ſo in the meditation and view of both: As it was in the Creation; <hi>The Evening and the Morning were the first day</hi>; The darkneſſe of the night led in the brightneſs of the morning; and as the Prophets word was <hi>post tenebras lucem</hi>; when we are humbled, and aſtoniſhed with the conſideration of Gods vengeance upon ſinners, then, and not till then are we meet for the apprehenſions of his wonderfull mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: In this regard it is truly verified <hi>that the fear of the Lord is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of wiſdom,</hi> and his judgments are they that make him feared; It is the thunder and rain that prepares the hearts of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els</hi> good counſel, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. It is with the hearts of men as with the Earth and the ſeaſons of the fruits thereof; If there be too much eaſe in the winter, and the Sun ſend forth gleames of heat towards the entrance of the ſpring it brings forth the bloſſoms haſtily, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by later froſts are nipped in the head and miſcarry; but if there be kindly froſts and colds at the firſt that hold in the juice of the plants, they are in due time drawn forth by ſeaſonable heates, and proſper; Firſt therefore let us be wrought upon by the meditation of judgments; and then we ſhall be fit for the beneficiall applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of mercy.</p>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:97700:68"/>
which hath ſwept away as our ſtory tells us 800000. in one City: Deſolations by inundations of Waters, which have covered the faces of many Regions, and rinſed the Earth of her unclean inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants: Deſolations by Earth quakes which have ſwallowed up whole Cityes, and thoſe great and populous. Deſolations wrought by the hand of his Angels; as in Egypt, in the tents of the <hi>Aſſyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> 185000. in one night in the camp of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Davids</hi> peſtilence; Deſolations wrought by the hands of men in Battails and maſſacres; Deſolations by Wild-beaſts, as in the Colonyes of <hi>Aſhur</hi> planted in <hi>Samaria</hi>: Deſolations by the ſwarms of obnoxious and noyſome crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſince in <hi>Africk, He ſpake the word, and the Graſhoppers came and Caterpillers innumerable. Pſ.</hi> 105.34. Inſomuch as in the conſulſhip of M. <hi>Fulvius Flaccus,</hi> after the bloody warrs of <hi>Africk,</hi> followed infinite numbers of Locuſts, which after devouring of all herbs and fruit were by a ſuddain wind hoyſed into the <hi>African</hi> ſea; infection followed upon their putrefection, and thereupon a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall mortality, in number fourſcore thouſand dyed, upon the <hi>Sea coaſt ſee</hi> twixt <hi>Carthage</hi> and <hi>Utica</hi> above 200000. Deſolations every way; and by what variety of means ſoever, yet all wrought by the divine hand: <hi>What deſolations he hath wrought</hi>; whoever be the inſtrument, he is the Author. This is that which God challengeth to himſelf, neither will he loſe the glory of theſe great executions. We men have a rule in the courſe of publick adminiſtations, and we think a politick one, that all matters of favour Princes ſhould derive from themſelves, but all acts of harſhneſſe and ſeverity they ſhould put off from their perſons to ſubordinate agents; God will not ſtand upon ſuch points, he rather profeſſes to lay claim to all the memorable acts of vengeance upon ſinfull Nations and People: Iſraels revolt under <hi>Jeroboam</hi> is owned by him in his meſſage to <hi>Rehoboams</hi> Captains: <hi>Aſhur is the rod of his wrath: He ſlew great Kings, and overthrew migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Kings; He hiſſeth for the Fly of Egypt, and for the Bee of Aſſyria, I ſay</hi> 7.13. <hi>Thou haſt ſcattered thine enemies abroad with thy mighty arme, Pſ.</hi> 89.11. Good reaſon that God ſhould claim the propriety of theſe Acts; For they are the noble effects and proofs of his vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive juſtice; Juſtice renders to all their own: Publick Deſolations are due to publick wickedneſſes. And if this ſhould not be done, how would it appear that God took notice of the notorious ſins of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or were ſenſible of their provocations? As in outward Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:97700:68"/>
if there were no Aſſizes or Seſſions to judg and puniſh malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors how could we think other but that all were turned lawleſſe, and that no reſpect is given to law or juſtice; the Wiſeman could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that becauſe judgment is not ſpeedily executed upon wicked men, the hearts of men are ſet in them to do evil. But ſurely, if it were not executed at all, men would turne Divells: But now that God calls ſinfull Nations to account for their iniquity by exemplary judgments men are ready to ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Doubtleſſe there is a God that judgeth the Earth, Pſ.</hi> 58.18. God will be glorified even for hell it ſelf <hi>Topheth is ordained of old. Iſa.</hi> 30.33.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Even theſe deſolatory judgments are a notable improvement of his mercy: There cannot eaſily be a greater proof of his reſpects to his own, then in ſweeping away their enemies. <hi>Which ſmote Egypt with their firſt born, for his mercy indureth for ever; which overthrew Pharaoh and his Hoſt in the ſea, for his mercy indureth for ever: which ſmote great Kings, and ſlew mighty Kings for his mercy indureth for ever; Sihon King of the Amorites, and Og the King of Baſan, for his mercy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth for ever. Pſ.</hi> 139.</p>
                  <p>Neither is there a greater demonſtration of his mercy in his ſtrokes then in his warnings; for ſurely God intends by theſe examples of his juſt vengeance, to deterr all others from following the footſteps of thoſe wicked men, whom he thus plagues: as good Princes and Magiſtrates do ſo order their executions that <hi>paena ad paucos, terror ad multos:</hi> ſome may ſmart, all may fear. It is excellent and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which the Apoſtle hath, 1 Cor. 10.11. <hi>Now all theſe things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto them for enſamples; and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.</hi> See I beſeech you, God hath further drifts in his executions of judgments then we can imagine; he intends them not only for acts, but patterns; he means not ſo much to puniſh, as to teach, every judgment 'tis a new leſſon, and to teach not the next ſucceſſions, but all generations of men to the end of the World; and if we do not make this uſe of his terrible proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, we ſhall be much wanting both to him and our ſelves: and no marvell if we be whipt for dull non-proficients in Gods School if we be not taught fear and obedience by his ſo many judgments.</p>
                  <p>We need not caſt our eyes much back to the view of former ages (though there we may meet with worlds of examples) let us but look at the preſent eſtate of our miſerable neighbourhood; of the

wofull ruines of <hi>Germany</hi>; once and in our time, one of the moſt rich, and flouriſhing countreys of the Chriſtian world, famous for goodly Cities, for a plentifull ſoyl, for frequence of trafique, for the ſeat of the Empire, now waſted with the miſeries of a long and cruell warr, wallowing in blood, buried in rubbidge and duſt: Oh ſee the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations that God hath wrought in this part of the earth, and pick out of them (as we well may) pitty, fear, thankfulneſs. Pitty and juſt commiſeration of the grievous ſufferings of that deſolate Nation; fear of that juſt hand of God which hath thus humbled them, and might no leſs deſervedly have fal'n as heavily upon us: thankfulneſs for thoſe gracious immunities which he hath given us hitherto, from their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills; and mercifull reſpites of repentance for thoſe ſins which have called down theſe judgments upon them.</p>
                  <p>And this is the former particular object which the Pſalmiſt calls our eyes unto; worthy of our view; but yet not the main and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſubject of this dayes diſcourſe; rather the other that now followes, the ceſſation of armes, and the bleſſing of peace, <hi>He makes Wars to ceaſe in all the World, &amp;c.</hi> however the ſight and due medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the miſeries of war and the vaſtations that follow upon it may be a good preparative to us for ſetting a true value upon the benefit of peace.</p>
                  <p>For us, Alas, we had rather a threatning then a ſenſe of war, our neighbours entred into our borders not with a publick denunciation of an offenſive war, but with a profeſſion of defence. And if ſome blood were mutually ſhed, in the paſſage it was not out of a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly hoſtile intention on either part (which had it been, might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have proceeded to a far greater ſlaughter) but out of the ſuddain apprehenſions of the intervening croſſes of each others purpoſes: And if the long abode in thoſe our quarters have been not a little chargeable to us, yet it hath been without any violent and bloody proſecution on either part; and now thanks be to God, they are paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed away in peace: But even this little glimpſe of a dry war is enough to ſhow us the wofull miſery of a war denounced, proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, executed to the height of cruelty; where there are nothing but intentions of killing, ſpoiling, deſolation: The anguiſh of this very touch is ſufficient to make us ſenſible of the torment of the full ſhock of a deſtructive war: Out of the ſenſe whereof let us look at this great work of contrary mercy which is here ſet forth unto us: <hi>He maketh wars to ceaſe unto the ends of the earth.</hi>

                  <p>That a Country, that a Nation is ſo, is ſo much more his work as there are more heads and hearts to governe: But that one Nation ſhould be at unity with another, yea that all Nations ſhould agree upon an univerſall ceſſation of armes, and embrace peace, <hi>A domino factum eſt hoc &amp; eſt mirabile,</hi> it muſt needs be the Lords doing ſo much more eminently, and it is marveilous in our eyes: <hi>Faciam eos in gentem unam,</hi> was a word fit only for the mouth of God: who only can reſtrain hands, and conjoyne hearts, as here, <hi>He maketh wars to ceaſe unto the ends of the Earth.</hi>

                  <p>In the firſt place, are we troubled with the fears or rumours of wars? are we grieved with the quarrells and diſſenſions that we finde within the boſome of our own Nation or Church? would we earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire to finde all differences compoſed, and a conſtant peace ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led amongſt us? we ſee whether to make our addreſſe, even to that omnipotent God <hi>who maketh warrs to ceaſe unto the ends of the earth, who breaketh the bow, and ſnappeth the ſpear in ſunder.</hi> And ſurely if ever any Nation had cauſe to complain, in the midſt of a publick peace, of the danger of private deſtractions, and factious diviſions, ours is it; wherein I know not how many uncouch Sects are lately riſen out of Hell to the diſturbance of our wonted peace; all of them ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly purſuing their own various fancies, and oppoſing our formerly received truth: what ſhould we do then but be take our ſelves in our

                  <p>But ſecondly, in vain ſhall we pray, if we do nothing: Our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſerve only to teſtifie the truth of our deſires; and to what purpoſe ſhall we pretend a deſire of that which we indeavour not to effect: That God who makes wars and quarrels to ceaſe, uſeth means to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh that peace which he decrees; And what are thoſe means but the inclinations, projects, labors of all the well-willers to peace? It muſt be our care therefore to immitate, yea to ſecond God in this great work of peace-making; The phraſe is a ſtrange but an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaticall one that <hi>Deborah</hi> uſes in her ſong; <hi>Curſe ye Meroz, ſaid the Angel of the Lord, curſe ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof; becauſe they came not to help the Lord, to help the Lord against the mighty: Judg.</hi> 5.23.

                  <p>We deſcend to our third uſe proper for this day, which is the challenge of our thankfulneſſe.

I could tell you of ſieging and famiſhing, ſacking, and ſpoiling, and killing, and raviſhing, and burning, of weltring in blood, and a thouſand ſuch tragicall calamities of war; but I had rather the ſpirit of God ſhould deſcribe them in his own expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; <hi>Theſe Sword without, &amp; terrour within ſhall deſtroy both the Young-man and the Virgin, the ſuckling alſo with the Man of gray haires, Deut.</hi> 32.25.

Neither is it more rare then formidable; If we ſhould ſee the Heavens ſtand ſtill but one houre, we ſhould (as we well might) expect a diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of all things: neither hath it leſſe horrour in it to feel the Earth ſtagger under us. Whoſe hair doth not ſtart up at this tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidation; and the more a man knowes, the more is his aſtoniſhment, <hi>He hangeth the Earth upon nothing,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Job.</hi>

                        <hi>Job</hi> 26.7.</note> For a man to feel the Earth that hangs upon nothing (but as ſome vaſt ball in the midſt of a thin yielding air) totter under him, how can his ſoul chooſe but be poſſeſſed with a ſecret fright and confuſion?

                  <p>Such are the diſtempers and publick calamities of States, though even of particular Kingdoms; but ſo much more as they are more univerſall; they are both unnaturall and dreadfull. They are poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickly unnaturall; For as the end of all motion is reſt, ſo the end of all civill and ſpirituall agitations is peace and ſettledneſſe. The very name of a State implies ſo much; which is we know <hi>a ſtando,</hi> from ſtanding, and not from moving; <hi>The man riding upon the red Horſe which ſtood upon the myrtle trees, Zachar.</hi> 1.11. deſcribes the condicion of a peacefull government; <hi>Behold all the Earth ſitteth ſtill, and is at reſt</hi>; and <hi>Micah, They ſhall ſit still every man under his vine and figtree,</hi>

                     <hi>and none ſhall make them afraid.</hi> Particular mens affayres are like the Clouds, publick government is as the Earth; The Clouds are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in motion, it were ſtrange for any of them to ſtand ſtill in one point of the air; ſo it were to ſee private mens occaſions void of ſome movings of quarrells or change; the publick State is, or ſhould be as the Earth a great and ſolid body, whoſe chief praiſe is ſettled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and conſiſtence: Now therefore when publick ſtirs and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults ariſe in a well ordered Church or Common-wealth, the State is out of the ſocket, or when common calamities of war, famine, peſtilence ſeize upon it, then the hearts of men quake and ſhiver within them; then is our prophets Earth-quake which is here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of: <hi>Thou haſt made the Earth to tremble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To begin with the paſſive motions of publick calamities; they are the ſhakings of our Earth. So God intends them, ſo muſt we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

them, and make uſe of them accordingly: what are we, I mean all the viſible part of us, but a peece of Earth? beſides therefore that magneticall vertue which is operative upon all the parts of it, why ſhould, or can a piece ſtand ſtill, when the whole moveth?</p>
                  <p>Denominations are wont to be not from the greater but the better part; and the beſt part of this Earthen World is man; and therefore when men are moved, we ſay the Earth is ſo, and when the Earth in a generality is thus moved, good reaſon we ſhould be ſo alſo: we muſt tremble therefore, when God makes the Earth to do ſo. What ſhall we ſay then to thoſe obdured hearts, which are nowhit affected with publick evils. Surely he were a bold man that could ſleep whiles the Earth rocks him, and ſo were he that could give himſelf to a ſtupid ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity when he feels any vehement concuſſations of government, or publick hand of Gods afflictive judgment. But it falls out too uſually, that as the Philoſopher ſaid in matter of affaires, ſo it is in matter of calamities, <hi>Communia negliguntur.</hi> Men are like <hi>Jonas</hi> in the ſtorm, ſleep it out, though it mainly concern them: ſurely, beſides that we are men, bound up each in his own skin, we are limbs of a community; and that body is no leſſe intire, and conſiſtent of all his members then this naturall; and no leſſe ſenſible ſhould we be of any evill that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts it; If but the leaſt toe do ache, the head feels it; but if the whole body be in pain much more do both head and feet feele it. Tell me, can it be that in a common Earth-quake any houſe can be free, or is the danger leſſe becauſe the neighbours roofes rattle alſo? Yet too many men, becauſe they ſuffer not alone, neither are ſingled out for Vengeance, are inſenſible of Gods hand: Surely ſuch men as cannot be ſhaken with Gods judgment are fit for the center, the loweſt parts of the Earth, where there is a conſtant and eternall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, not for the ſurface of it which looks towards an Heaven, where are interchanges of good and evill.</p>
                  <p>It is notable and pregnant which the prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> hath, hear it all ye ſecure hearts, and tremble. <hi>In that day did the Lord of Hoſts call to weeping, and mourning, and baldneſſe, and girding with ſackcloth, and behold joy and gladneſſe, ſlaying of Oxen, and killing of Sheep, eating Fleſh, and drinking Wine</hi>; And what of that? <hi>Surely this iniquity ſhall not be purged till you die, ſaith the Lord God of Hoſts.</hi> What ſhall we ſay to this, honourable and beloved; wherefore hath God given us his good creatures, but that we ſhould injoy them? Doth not

                     <hi>Solomon</hi> tell us <hi>there is nothing better then that a man ſhould Eat, and Drink, and make his ſoule injoy good in his labour. Eccles.</hi> 2.24. And why is God ſo incenſed againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> for doing what he allowes them? Know then that it is not the act but the time that God ſtands upon. Very unſeaſonableneſs is criminall, here and now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts are ſins; to be joviall when God calls to mourning, to glut our maw when he calls to faſting, to glitter when he would have us ſackcloth'd and ſqualid, he hates it to the death; here we may ſay with <hi>Solomon, Of laughter thou art mad, and of mirth what is this thou doeſt?</hi> He grudges not our moderate, and ſeaſonable jolities, there is an Ope-tyde by his allowance, as well as a Lent. <hi>Go thy wayes; Eat thy Bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart, for now God accepteth thy work.</hi> Lo Gods acceptation is warrant enough for our mirth: Now may his ſaints rejoyce, and ſing, but there is a time to mourne, and a time to daunce. It was a ſtrange word that God had to the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> that he would take away from him his wife, the comfort of his life, and yet he muſt not mourne, but ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when he but threats to take away from us the publick comforts of our peace, and common welfare; he would have us weep out our eyes: and doth no leſſe hate that our hearts ſhould be quiet within us, then he hates that we ſhould give him ſo juſt cauſe of our diſquiet. Here the Prophet can cry out, <hi>Quis dabit capiti meo aquas</hi>? And how doth the mournfull prophet now pour out himſelf into Lamentations, <hi>How hath the Lord covered the doughter of Sion with a cloud in his anger, and caſt down from heaven to the earth the beauty of Iſrael. Lament.</hi> 2.1. Oh that our hearts could rive in ſunder at but the dangers of thoſe publick Judgments which we have too well deſerved; and be leſſe ſenſible of our private concernments; then ſhould we make a right uſe of that dreadfull hand of God, of whom our prophet here, <hi>thou haſt made the Earth to tremble.</hi>

                  <p>This for the paſſive Earth-quake of publick calamities; now for the active of publick ſtirs and tumults; with theſe the land is moved too; and this quaking is ſo much more unnaturall for that men are here the immediate troublers of themſelves, whereas in the other they are moved by the immediate hand of God: And here alas, what ſhall we ſay to thoſe men that take pleaſure in the embroyling of States? that with <hi>Nero</hi> can ſing to ſee the City on fire, that love to daunce upon a quaking earth: Yea that affect to be actors in theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly

motitations. That great <hi>Mathematician</hi> braggart could vainly ſay, give me a place where to ſet my foot, and I will move the earth; that which that proud <hi>Engineer</hi> would do by Art, theſe men will do by wickedneſs, that and more, for they will be moving that earth which they cannot but tread upon. I remember <hi>Georgias A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gricola</hi> (who when I was a young man was noted for the moſt accurate obſerver of theſe under ground ſecrets of nature) tells us moſt probably, that the ſecondary and immediate cauſe of an Earth-quake is a certain ſubterraneous fire kindled of ſome ſulphureous matter within the bowels of that vaſt body, and increaſed by the reſiſtance of the ambient coldneſſe, the paſſages whereof being precluded and blocked up by the ſolid and cold matter of the earth, it rages, and roars, within thoſe dark hollowes, and by the violence of it, as murmuring to be thus forceably impriſoned, ſhakes the parts about it, and at laſt makes way by ſome dreadfull <hi>Veſuvian</hi>-like eruption: Such is the miſ-kindled heat of ſome vehement ſpirits: this, when it lights upon ſome earthy, proud, ſullen, head-ſtrong diſpoſition, and findes it ſelf croſſed by an authoritative reſiſtance, growes deſperately unruly; and in a mad indignation to be ſuppreſſed is ready to ſhake the very foundations of government; and at laſt breaks forth into ſome dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous rupture, whether in Church or State: Let no man think I intend to ſtrike at a wiſe, holy, well-govern'd zeal; no, I hugge this in my boſome, as the lively temper of grace, as the very vitall ſpirits of religion; I wiſh there were more of that in the World; I ſpeak of the unruly diſtempers of male-contented perſons, and of the furies of Anabaptiſm and Separation. Let ſuch men think what they will of themſelves, <hi>Solomon</hi> has paſt his doom upon them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Homo nequam miſcet contentiones,</hi> as <hi>Tremelius</hi> turnes it: He is no better then a wicked man that hatcheth diviſions; how ever they may ſleight this contentious humour, I dare confidently ſay, a private murderer ſhall make an eaſyer anſwer then a publick diſturber, even Apoſtolicall charity can wiſh, <hi>would to God they were cut off that trouble you,</hi> And more then ſo, whereas they would not be more ſtirring then their neighbours, if they did not think themſelves wiſer, he that is wiſer then they gives them their own. <hi>It is an honour for a man to ceaſe from ſtrife, but every fool will be medling, Prov.</hi> 20.3. So then a quarrelſome man in a pariſh, eſpecially if he have gotten a little ſmattering of law, is like a cholick in the guts, that teares, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:97700:76"/>
wrings, and torments a whole townſhip; but a Seditionary in a State, or a Schiſmatick in the Church is like a ſulphureous fiery Vapour in the bowels of the Earth, able to make that ſtable element reele a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; worſe then that Monſter of Tyrants, who could ſay, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>I come not hither to aſtoniſh you with the relation of the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full effects which Earth-quakes have produced in all ages, as it were eaſy to do out of hiſtories and Philoſophical diſcourſes; where you may ſee Rocks torne in pieces, Mountains not caſt down only but removed, Hills raiſed not out of Vallies only, but out of Seas, Fires breaking out of Waters, Stones and Cinders belched up, Rivers changed, Seas diſlodged, Earth opening, Towns ſwallowed up, and many other ſuch hideous events: Of which kind our own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory can furniſh us with too many at home; although theſe colder climates are more rarely infeſted with ſuch affrightfull accidents. It is more properly in my way to ſhew you the parallell effects of the diſtempers and calamities in States, and Churches.

Princes of the Aſſembly, famous in the Congregation, men of renown, riſe up in the mutiny againſt their Governours; and theſe draw with them all the Congregation of Iſrael to the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation; What is the Iſſue; After <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> his proclamation the people withdraws from their tents, the earth opens her mouth, ſwallows up <hi>Corah</hi> and his Company, withall that pertained to them, and they go down quick into the pit. What a ſhriek do you think there was, when they found themſelves ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into that dreadfull gulfe; as for the 250. <hi>Reubenites,</hi> fire came out from the Lord and conſumed them: Lo, the two terrible ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects even of materiall Earth-quakes, opening and burning, which we ſhall find ſpiritually happening in all commotions of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

I ſay we have had a long and happy peace, although perhaps it is no thank to ſome body: for had that ſulphureous mine taken fire (as it was very near it) this State in all likelyhood had not been ſhaken only, but quite blowen up; thoſe goodly piles and therein the Monuments of ancient Kings had been, together with the yet ſtirring limbes of dying Princes, buried in their own ruine, and rubbiſh; <hi>Deus omen.</hi>

the Wound is incurable; or to the State of the <hi>Sareptans</hi> Son, that there was no breath left in him; but like <hi>Eutichus</hi> rather, bruiſed but yet breathing, And ſtill, ſtill there is balme in <hi>Gilead</hi>; let our Wounds be never ſo deep, repentance may, can, will recure them, let not us think onwards to heal Gods people with good words; this is the way to feſter them within; No let us who are Gods Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions make uſe of the probe of Wiſe Auſtere judgment; let us gage the ſore to the botome, and tent it home with the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Law; let us take off the proud fleſh with the corroſiving denunciations of vengeance to the impenitent ſinners; and then when it is thoroughly drawn let us lay on the ſoveraign emplaiſters of the moſt precious and meritorious mercy of our bleſſed Redeemer. Thus, thus muſt all our ſpirituall ſores be healed; and oh, that we could obtain of our own hearts to addreſſe our ſelves to a ſaving uſe of theſe ſure remedies: how happy were both for our ſoules and for our Land, whoſe ſores yet lye dangerouſly open; how ſoon would our juſtly provoked God take off his heavy judgments?

                  <p>But as we commonly ſay the Chirurgion heals the wound, and yet that the Plaiſter heals it too, the Chirurgion by the plaiſter; ſo may we juſtly here, it is God that heals, and the means heal: God by the means, and the means by and under God, and ſurely when we pray or expect that God ſhould heal either of theſe brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, we do not mean to ſue to him to work miracles, this were (as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid truely in the like caſe) to tempt God, but we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech God to give and bleſs thoſe means whereby thoſe breaches

may be made up. As for the calamitous breaches, thoſe we wiſh may be healed, ſo far as the arme of fleſh can reach by the vigilance and ower of Soveraignity, by the prudence of wiſe Stateſmen by the ſage Councell of the State and Kingdome, by wholſome provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of good Lawes, by carefull and juſt executions. As for quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellous and diſcontented breaches, there are other Remedies to heal them; the Remedies muſt be as the cauſes of them from within. Let the firſt be a reſolution of confining our deſires within the due bounds, not affecting mutuall incroachments, or unneceſſary inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations: Not Incroachments firſt, Good Lord, what a ſtir theſe two great wranglers <hi>Meum,</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> make in the World; were it not for them, all would be quiet: Juſtice muſt do her part betwixt them both; holding the balance even with a <hi>ſuum cuique,</hi> and ſayes with the Maſter of the vineyard <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Not innovations ſecondly: It is that which <hi>Job</hi> findes out as one of the hainouſeſt ſins of his time, Some remove the Land-marks; a thing which God hath given ſtrict charge againſt <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.4. and we from <hi>Moſes</hi> fetcht it into our Lenten Curſes, <hi>Curſed be he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth his neighbours Land-marks, Deut.</hi> 27.17. even in this caſe, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The ſecond Remedy muſt be a diſcreet moderation in the purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our apprehended right: How many good matters have been marr'd with ill handling; The debter did owe to the rigorous ſteward an hundred pence; no doubt the dept was due, he might juſtly claim it; but to lay hands on the man, and to offer to pluck it out of his debters throat, this is juſtly taxed for a foul cruelty; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny an honeſt Corinthian was injured by his wrangling neighbour, and had <hi>juſtiſſimam cauſam litigandi</hi>; yet for Chriſtians to go to law before infidels, this the Apoſtle taxes for a ſinfull peece of Juſtice; <hi>why rather ſuffer ye not wrong</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; This is <hi>durus ſerms,</hi> ſaies ſome brangling pariſhioner that fetches up his poor Miniſter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Term for trifles, yet in St. <hi>Paules</hi> judgment <hi>a ſleight injury is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them a ſcandalous quarrell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third is a meek complying with each other, relenting (ſo far as we may with all poſſible ſafety) on either part, if the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be between unequalls, charitable and mercifull on the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours part, humble and ſubmiſs on the inferiours. <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> fall upon a difference; <hi>Abraham</hi> is the better man, he is the Uncle, <hi>Lot</hi> but the Nephew; yet <hi>Abraham</hi> ſeeks the peace and follows it with him, whom one would think he might have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
                  <p>Good <hi>David</hi> had done his Maſter and Father in Law no wrong, unleſs it were <hi>tu pugnas ego vapulo</hi>; and yet after good demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his loyalty, how humbly doth he beg a reconcilement at the hands of <hi>Saul; Wherefore doth my Lord the King purſue after his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; Now therefore, let my Lord the King hear the words of his Servant, If the Lord have ſtirred thee up against me, Let him accept an offering.</hi> Harſh conteſtations never did good; The ball rebounds from the floor to the face of him that throwes it, whereas a look of wooll

Away then with all falſe jelouſies, and uncharitable gloſſes of each others actions and eſtates; Let us all in the fear of God be intreated in the bowels of our dear Redeemer, as we our Selves, our Land, our Church, the Goſpell, to combine our counſells and indeavours to the <hi>holding of the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace,</hi> and labour, and ſtudy not how to widen or gall, and ranckle, but how to ſalve and heal theſe unhappy ſores of the Church and State by confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our deſires within the due bounds, free from incroachments, from innovations; by a diſcreet moderation in all our proſecutions, by a meek relenting even in due challenges, by a fair and charitable conſtruction of each others acts, and intentions; and laſtly by our fervent perſwaſions and prayers; and ſo many as are thus minded, peace be upon them, and upon the whole Iſrael of God, this day and for ever <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>There is no eſtate ſo happy (if it could be obtained) as that of perfect obedience; but ſince that cannot be had, partly through the weakneſſe, and partly through the wickedneſſe of our nature, for there is a (<gap reason="foreign">

to us in a remote diſtance from God; in the other, as foul and naſty, both in his heart, and his hands; and the remedy is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed for both: of his remoteneſſe; <hi>drawing nigh to God</hi>; of his foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>Cleanſing and purging</hi>; the former is enough to take up our thoughts at this time: Wherein ye have a duty injoyned, and an inducement urged, the Duty, <hi>draw nigh to God,</hi> the Inducement; <hi>God will draw nigh to you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To begin with the former, the duty of <hi>drawing nigh</hi> implies ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and requires ſomething; it implies a diſtance, and requires an act of approach:</p>
                  <p>It implies a diſtance, for we cannot be ſaid to draw near, if we were not afar off; The ſinner therefore is in a remote diſtance from God, and that in reſpect of both termes; both as of God, and as of the ſinner.</p>
                  <p>Of God, firſt, the ſinner then is aloof off from God, not from the preſence of his eſſence, and power; ſo he would be afar off, and cannot; <hi>Whether ſhall I go from thy preſence, or whether ſhall I flee from thy Spirit? If I go up to Heaven thou art there, and if</hi> (as our new Tranſlation hath it) <hi>I make my bed in hell</hi>; (an uneaſy bed God knowes that is made there) <hi>yet there thou art alſo</hi>: Ye the Devills themſelves could not have their being but from God; for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is good though themſelves be wicked; that they are ſpirits they have from God, that they are evil Spirits (and ſo Devils) is from themſelves: And their companions the wofull reprobate ſoules would fain be further off from God, if they could: They ſhall in vain call to the Rocks and Mountains to cover them from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; he cannot be excluded from any place, that fills and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all things: How then is the ſinner aloof off from God? From the holineſſe of God; from the grace and mercy of God, from the glory of God: From the holineſſe of God, he is no leſſe diſtant then evill is from good, which is no leſſe then infinitely: There is no locall diſtance but is capable of a meaſure (for an actuall infinite magnitude is but an atheous paradoxe in philoſophy:) If it be to the Antipodes themſelves, on the other ſide of the earth, we can have a ſcale of miles that can reach them: yea of furlongs, of paces, of feet, of barley cornes; but betwixt good and evil there is no poſſible, no imaginable proportion; and as from the holineſſe of God, ſo from the grace and mercy of God, he is no leſſe diſtant
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:97700:84"/>
then guilt is from remiſſion, which is alſo no leſſe then infinitely; for the ſinner, as he is and continues ſuch, is utterly uncapable of remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; It is true that Gods mercy is over all his works, but the ſinner is none of them; <hi>By him were made all things that were made, John</hi> 1. but God never made the ſinner, God made the man; but it is the Devil and mans free-will that made the ſinner, indeed ſin is nothing elſe but the marring of that which God hath made; ſin therefore without repentance may never hope for remiſſion; when repentance comes in place it ceaſeth in Gods imputation to be it ſelf, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it there is no place for mercy: <hi>Many ſorrows,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>ſhall be to the wicked,</hi>

                  <p>This for the diſtance in reſpect of God; will ye ſee it in reſpect of the ſinner himſelf; He is aloof off from God in his thoughts, in his affections, in his carriage and actions. In his thoughts firſt, which are onely evill, continually; He never thinks of God, but when he feels him puniſhing; and, then; not without a murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kind of regret,<note place="margin">

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97700:85"/>
off, as nothing concerning him, he is as near to God as the beſt: and indeed in ſome ſenſe he is ſo, St. <hi>Paul</hi> could ſay to his <hi>Athenians, He is not far from every one of us</hi>: Every creature hath equally his living, moving, being from God; but as for any relation to God, in reſpect of holineſſe, of grace and mercy, of glory; this man is as far off as Earth is from Heaven, yea as Heaven is from Hell. For, even by nature, we are the beſt of us, the Sons of wrath. And if we had no more then even our birth ſin, this alone would eſtrange us ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently from God; but beſides this, our actuall ſins ſet us off yet further; and if we had no ſins of commiſſion (as we have number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, for in many things we ſin all, yea in all things we ſin all) yet thoſe of omiſſion cannot but put us into an utter diſtance; for if the morall man could be ſuppoſed to do nothing actually againſt Gods will, yet his thoughts are not upon him, being wholly taken up with the World; his affections are not towards him, being wholly ſet upon the World, and theſe earthly things; his beſt actions are not regulated by the royall law of righteouſneſſe, but by the rules of civility and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon humanity; and the end which he propoſeth to himſelf in them is, not the glory of God, but his own honour or advantage. And therefore both the wicked man, and the mere morall man are aloof off from God; and therefore out of the benefit of Gods favour and protection; even as we know that thoſe which live under the two poles, are out of the comfortable reach of the Sun-beames; or thoſe <hi>Antichtho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> which are on the other ſide of the globe of the Earth, are now whiles it is day with us. <hi>Pleaſe your ſelves therefore ye ſinfull and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall men, with the ſpirituall condicion wherein ye ſtand</hi>; God is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe near to you, but to plague and puniſh you, Ye can never receive any glimpſe of true comfort in your ſoules, whiles you ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and therefore as ye tender your own preſent and eternall welfare, ſtir up your ſelves, to take this divine Counſell of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Draw nigh unto God</hi>; And ſo from the diſtance implyed, we deſcend to the approach injoyned; which we ſhall conſider as it hath reſpect to the preſence of God; and to the motion of man: To the preſence of God, in relation to his Ordinances, and to his Spirit;</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, we <hi>draw nigh unto God,</hi> when we attend upon him in his worſhip and ſervice; for God is where he is worſhipped, and where he reveales himelf; In this regard, when <hi>Cain</hi> was bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from the preſence of God, it was not ſo much an exile, as an
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:97700:85"/>
excommunication; Hence is all the legall ſervice called appearing before the Lord; <hi>So David, when ſhall I appear in thy ſight, Pſal.</hi> 42.2. and can find in his heart for this cauſe, to envy the ſparrowes and ſwallowes as herein happier then himſelf; Thus <hi>Jacob</hi> of his <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel, God was here and I knew it not</hi>! Then therefore do we <hi>draw nigh unto God,</hi> when we come into his houſe; when we preſent our ſelves to him in our prayers, whether private or publick, when we attend upon him in his word, whether read, or preached; in his holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, in all religious exerciſes; And thoſe that do willingly neglect theſe holy ſervices, they are no other then aloof off from God; and certainly, (whatſoever they may think of it) this eſtate of theirs is very dangerous; for if the worſt peece of helliſh torment be that of loſſe: and utter departing from the preſence of God, then ſurely our voluntary Elongation of our ſelves from his preſence muſt needs be a fearfull introduction to an everlaſting diſtance from him: Let our Recuſants (whether out of hereſie or faction) make what ſleight account they pleaſe of theſe holy aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, Surely the keeping away from the Church is the way to keep out of Heaven: <hi>Auditus aſpectum restituit,</hi> as <hi>Bernard</hi> well, It is our hearing that muſt reſtore us to the ſight of God.</p>
                  <p>This in relation to his Ordinances, that to his ſpirit followes; we do then, Secondly, <hi>draw nigh to God,</hi> when upon our converſion to him, we become the receptacles and entertainers of his good Spirit: For God is undoubtedly where he breathes into the ſoul holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, where he works Heavenly grace in the heart; This preſence followes upon the other, or accompanies it: For, when we do carefully and conſcionably, wait upon Gods ordinance, then his Spirit offers, and conveighs it ſelf into the heart; theſe are <hi>Vehicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum gratiae,</hi> the carriage of grace into the ſoul; Never any ſcorner, or profane perſon hath any ſenſe of this preſence; This is that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſpeaks ſo paſſionately of; <hi>Oh caſt me not away from thy preſence, and take not thine holy ſpirit from me</hi>; It troubled him, as before, to be kept from Gods ordinances; but it troubled him an hundred times more to be caſt out from this (more entire) preſence;<note place="margin">

things that can befall to a man: For, there is a ſpirituall familiarity of ſweet converſation betwixt God and his, which it is a death to forgoe: they injoy each other, live in each others ſight, impart their counſels each to other: So then, <hi>we draw near to God,</hi> when repenting us of our former aberrations from him we renue our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants with him, put our ſelves into an awfull acknowledgment of him; ſtill ſeeing him that is inviſible; when we grow into dear (though trembling) acquaintance with him; taking pleaſure in his company, interchanging our <hi>dulce ſuſurrium cum Deo,</hi> as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaks, and indevouring to be in all things approved of him; This muſt needs be a very comfortable and bleſſed condicion; Oh happy, thrice happy are they that ever they were born, who have truly attained to it; It is a true rule in philoſophy, that every natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall agent works by a contaction, whether bodily, or virtuall; which the weaker, or further off it is, the efficacy of the operation is ſo much the leſſe; As when we are cold, the fire heates us, but not except we come within the reach of it; If we ſtand aloof off it warmes us ſo feebly, that we are little the better for it; but if we draw cloſe to the hearth, now it ſenſibly refreſheth us; even thus alſo doth God himſelf pleaſe to impart himſelf to us; How ever there is infinite vertue in the Almighty, not confinable to any limits;<note place="margin">

Oh let us take up at the laſt, ſerious reſolutions to return home, though by weeping croſſe, and put our ſelves into our way; we ſhall be ſure that our indulgent Father will eſpie us afar off, and meet us in our paſſage, and welcome us with a kiſſe: according to this word in my Text, <hi>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you</hi>: And ſo from the duty injoyned, we deſcend to the Inducement propoſed.</p>
                  <p>But indeed, what needs any inducement at all; There are actions that carry their reward in their mouth; ſuch is this we have in hand: It is a great honour to us wretched Creatures, that we may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to draw nigh to the Lord of glory: If there do but an earthly Prince come ever, though we have no relation to him at all, yet what preſſing there is to ſee him, ſo as there is need of Uſhers, or whifflers to ſtave off the multitude; but if our own would allow all his ſubjects to repair to his Court with expectation of favour and countenance from him, what thronging would there be to his gates, what ambition to enter? And, Lo, the God of Heaven gives us this gracious liberty of a free acceſſe, and yet withall backs it
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:97700:88"/>
with a ſtrong motive of advantage; <hi>He will draw nigh unto you</hi>: And indeed what inducement can there be equally powerfull to this, that <hi>God will draw nigh to us.</hi> There is nothing in us but want, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, infirmity, deformity; there is nothing in God, but perfection, and glory; and therefore, for us vile wretches to draw nigh to him, what can it be other then an honour too high for us; but for him to draw nigh to us, what can it be but a kind of diſparagement to him? Ye know what a conſtruction was ſet upon our Saviour for this very point, <hi>that he did eat and drink with Publicans and Sinners</hi>; and how the proud Phariſee cenſur'd him, when that humble peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent made an ewre of her eyes, and a towell of her hair for the feet of Chriſt;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luc·</hi> 7.39.</note> Oh, ſaith he <hi>if this man were a Prophet, he would have known what manner of woman this is that toucheth him, for ſhe is a ſinner</hi>: as if the ſuffering himſelf to be toucht by a ſinner were diſgrace e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; and yet the God of Heaven will deſcend to us ſo low, as notwithſtanding our extream ſinfulneſſe and unworthineſſe to draw nigh unto us.</p>
                  <p>God will be ſo to us, as we are to him; As face anſwers to face, ſo doth God to us: when ye look upon your glaſſe, if you ſmile up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, it will ſmile upon you again, if you frown, it will ſo do alſo: even ſo doth God with us; with the pure thou wilt be pure, with the mercifull, thou wilt be mercifull; with the froward thou wilt ſhow thy ſelf froward; If thou run away from God, he will run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way as faſt from thee, <hi>if thou draw nigh unto God, he will draw nigh to thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And how will <hi>God draw nigh unto us</hi>: In his Ordinances, In his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, in his Graces, In his Aid and Salvation.</p>
                  <p>In his Ordinances; For God hath graciouſly as it were tyed his preſence to them, as under the law, ſo no leſſe under the Goſpell; when <hi>Jethro, Moſes his Father in Law took a burnt offering, and ſacrifice for God; Aaron came, and all Iſrael with him to eat bread with Moſes his Father in Law, before the Lord, Exod.</hi> 18.12. where was that but before the Teſtimony of his preſence, the Cloudy Pillar? And that is very pregnant which God hath <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.40. <hi>This ſhall be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall burnt offering throughout your Generations, at the door of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of the Congregation, before the Lord, where I will meet you, to ſpeak there with thee.</hi> Lo; God meets us in the holy Aſſemblies; Meets us? yea ſtayes with us there: <hi>Zach.</hi> 2.10. The prophet ſpeaking
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:97700:88"/>
of the dayes of the Goſpell; <hi>Sing and rejoyce</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>O Daughter of Sion; for, Lo, I come and will dwell in the midſt of thee, ſaith the Lord</hi>: Contrarily, when he withdrawes from any people the ordinary means of ſalvation he is truly ſaid to depart from them: but this, perhaps, not at once, but by degrees; as in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> viſion he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves firſt to the threſhold, and from thence to the door of the Eaſt-gate; and this I would have you know to be done, not only in a meer ſilence, but in a corruption of doctrine: not only when faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mouths are ſtopped, but when mens mouths are lawleſly open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to the venting whether of popiſh fancies, or ſatyricall invectives againſt authority, for you may not think that all diſcourſes are preaching, or all preaching Goſpell: when men preach themſelves and not Chriſt, when they utter their own impetuous fury, and not the glad tidings of peace, how ſhall we call this the meſſage of God? No, God was not in the winde, he was not in the fire: he was in the ſoft voice; And he that walks betwixt the golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks doth not go away only when the light is quite out, but when the ſnuff burns unſavourily in the ſocket; Shortly, where the ſincere milk of the Goſpell is given to Gods babes; and the ſolid meat of true Orthodox and ſaving doctrine is ſet before the ſtronger men, there God viſits his people in mercy, and is drawn nigh to them in his holy Ordinance.</p>
                  <p>Secondly in his audience, we uſe to ſay, out of ſight out of mind; and thoſe that are out of diſtance what noiſe ſo ever they make, are not heard; <hi>The raviſhed Virgin in the field,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>cryed out, and there was none to ſave her. Deut.</hi> 22.27. but when we come neer, the leaſt groan and ſigh is heard; Thus God, who is never but with us, is ſaid to come neer us, when he gives proof to us that he comes not only within the ken of our neceſſities, but within the hearing of the ſofteſt whiſperings of our prayers.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>David</hi> every where; <hi>The Lord hath heard my ſupplication, the Lord will hear my prayer, Pſ.</hi> 6. <hi>The Lord will hear me when I call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him</hi>: The tender mother is never away from the bed-ſide of her ſick child, but if ſhe perceive the diſeaſe to grow dangerous, now ſhe is more attentive, and layes her ear to the mouth of it, and liſtens to every breathing that it fetcheth; ſo doth our heavenly father to us; <hi>The Lord is nigh to all that call upon him,</hi> ſaith the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt: Nigh them indeed, for he puts into them thoſe holy deſires,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:97700:89"/>
which he graciouſly hears, and anſwers. Contrarily, when that ſweet ſinger of Iſrael findes ſome ſtop made of his audience, he is then in another tune: <hi>Wherefore hideſt thou thy face, and forgetteſt our affliction, and our oppreſſion, Pſal,</hi> 44.24. ſtill meaſuring Gods near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to us by his regard, and (as it were) re-ecchoing to our prayers.</p>
                  <p>A third, and yet nearer, and happier approach of God to us, is, in his Grace and favour; in the other two (as in his word and in our prayers) he may come near us, little to our availe. He ſpeaks to many in his word that hear him not, or that hear him to their further judgment: Our goſpell is howſoever a ſweet ſavour to God, yet a ſavour of death unto death to many a ſoul, <hi>wo be to thee Chorazin, wo be to thee Bethſaida:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He hears many ſpeak to him in their prayers, but for their own puniſhment; and ſometimes will not hear, in mercy to the petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; the Devill ſues to enter into the Swine, and is heard; <hi>Paul</hi> ſues to be freed from the buffets of the meſſenger of Satan, and is (mercifully) not heard; the Iſraelites have Quailes according to their deſires, but ſauced to them with a vengeance; But this third appropinquation of God, is never other then cordiall, and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall. It is a ſweet word, <hi>I will dwell amongſt the Children of Iſraell, and will be their God, Exod.</hi> 29.45. Yea this is true happineſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that God will ſo dwell with us as to be ours. St. <hi>Paul</hi> told the <hi>Athenians</hi> moſt truely (<hi>non longe ab unoquoque</hi>) he is not far from every one of us; how ſhould he, when in him we live, and move, and are? but little are we the better for theſe generall favours, (which are common to all his creatures) if we do not finde in our ſelves a ſpeciall intereſt in the preſence of his Spirit: If he only call on us as a paſſenger, or lodge with us as a ſtranger, or ſojourne with us as a gueſt, this can be ſmall comfort to us, nor any thing leſſe then his ſo dwelling with us, as that he dwell in us, and that, not as an inmate, but as an owner: <hi>Know ye not that Chriſt dwells in you,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, unleſſe ye be Reprobates</hi>: Know ye not that ye are the Temples of the living God; his Temples, for a perpetuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation of which he hath ſaid, <hi>Here ſhall be my reſt for ever:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereupon there will be ſure to follow the fourth degree of his appropinquation, which is our aid, and ſweet experience of his mercifull deliverance. It was out of a full ſenſe of Gods goodneſſe,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:97700:89"/>
that holy <hi>David</hi> breaks out into that heavenly <hi>Epiphonema, The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, and ſaveth ſuch as be of a contrite Spirit; many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth him out of them all, Pſal.</hi> 34.18, 19. <hi>His ſalvation is nigh to them that fear him, that glory may dwell in our Land, Pſal.</hi> 85.9.</p>
                  <p>So then, the ſum of all is this, that if we draw nigh unto God, he will be ſure to draw nigh to us, in his Ordinances, in his Audience, in his Graces, in his Aid.</p>
                  <p>But, what ſhall we ſay to the order of theſe two approaches? One would have thought he ſhould have ſaid; God drawes near to you, therefore draw you near to God: For ſurely, his approach to us is the cauſe that we come near to him, and not our approach to him cauſeth him to come near to us: Do not think that God and man ſtrain courteſie, who ſhall begin, or that man hath any power to draw to God, but from God: The true order of our regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is that <hi>Cantic.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Draw me and I ſhall run after thee.</hi> There have been contrary hereſies in the Church concerning this point. The <hi>Manichees</hi> held man in all things dragged by a neceſſity of deſtiny: The <hi>Pelagians</hi> held man led altogether by his will, ſo as that can alone enable him to do good, and to feoffe him in bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: And our <hi>Semipelagian</hi> Papiſts go not much leſſe, ſave that they ſuppoſe ſome help given to the will, which it can thus improve.</p>
                  <p>The Orthodox Church ſtill hath gone, and doth go a mid-way betwixt theſe; ſo aſcribing all to grace, that it deſtroyes not nature, teaching us (as <hi>Bernard</hi> well) that we will is from nature, that we will good and well, is from grace.</p>
                  <p>But if it ſtick with you that we are bidden to draw nigh to God, and therefore we can do it; elſe the exhortation were vain and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon-leſſe; know that theſe charges ſhow us what we ſhould do, not what we can do; and that he who bids us, can and doth together with the word of his invitation, inable us to do what he requires; his Spirit working with his word effects what he commands; As a mother, or nurſe bids the child come to her, but reaches forth a finger to uphold it in the walk: If therefore Wiſdom ſay in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> 1.17. <hi>I love them that love me</hi>: yet St. <hi>John</hi> muſt comment upon <hi>Solomon, prior dilexit; he loved us firſt, elſe we could never have loved him,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.19. It is true, that in order of time, there is no difference betwixt Gods working, and our willing our converſion,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:97700:90"/>
ſo ſoon as it is fire it burnes, and if it burnes, it is fire: but in order of nature Gods work is before ours, as the cauſe before the effect. As we therefore ſay ſenſibly, blow the fire and it will burne; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying that our blowing doth not make it to be fire but helps to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the heat where fire is; ſo doth the Spirit of God ſay here; <hi>draw nigh to God and he will draw nigh to you</hi>; Our firſt motion of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God is the work of God; he that thus drawes our will to him, upon our pliant obedience to his will, thus graciouſly ſeconds, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his own work in us; ſo if we draw nigh to him, by his co-work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace, he will draw nearer ſtill to us by his perfecting grace.</p>
                  <p>And oh, how happy a condicion is this, whoſoever hath by Gods mercy attained unto it. What can that man want who injoyes him that poſſeſſes all things? <hi>In thy preſence is the fulneſſe of joy,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt: as contrarily, in his eſtranging of himſelf from us, there is nothing but grief and horrour. It is with God and the Soul, as betwixt the Sun and the Earth: In the declining of the Year, when the Sun drawes afar off from us, how doth the Earth mourne, and droop: how do the Trees caſt off the ornaments of their leaves and fruit, how doth the Sap of all Plants run down to the root, and leave the bare boughs ſeemingly feare and dead; But at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of it, in the riſing of the Spring, all things ſeem revived; the earth decks her ſelf in her freſh abiliments of bloſſomes, leaves, flowers, to entertain thoſe comfortable heats and influences: ſo and more is it in the declining or approach of this all-glorious Sun of righteouſneſſe; In his preſence there is life and bleſſedneſſe, in his abſence nothing but dolour, diſconſolateneſſe, deſpair; if an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly King do but withdraw himſelf from us for a time, we are troubled; how much more if the King of glory ſhall abſent himſelf from us in diſpleaſure. Surely, nothing but our ſins can eſtrange him from us; our miſeries do rather attract him to us; our ſins are only they that ſeparate between God and us: That we may therefore ſhut up in ſome application; there is the ſame reaſon of a particular ſoul, and of a whole Church; one of theſe is but an abridgment of the other, there is therefore the ſame conſideration of Gods abſence from, or preſence with both: And certainly, if ſins can alienate a people from God, and God from a people, we have caſt our ſelves miſerably aloof from him; For which of his commandments have we not ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully violated; wo is me, how is our patient God affronted by us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:97700:90"/>
day? By our atheous profaneſſe, by our frequent oathes, and blaſphemies, by our wilfull diſobediences, by our pride, exceſſe, drunkenneſſe, uncleaneſſe, uſury, cozenages, oppreſſions, lying, ſlanderous detractions (as if we would utterly caſheere the ninth commandement out of the Decalogue)? Yea, what evil is there under Heaven that we can waſh our hands of? But withall, we are ſo much the further off from God, by how much we either were, or or ſhould have been nearer; of a people that knew not God, that could not know him, no other could be expected: Had we had the Goſpel of the Kingdome lock't up from us, and been kept hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wink't from the knowledg of his royall Law; the times of ſuch ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance God had not regarded; But now that we have had ſo clear a light of Gods truth ſhining in our faces; and ſuch importunate ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations from God, to reclaim us from our wicked wayes, by his Meſſengers, riſing early and ſuing to us; and yet have (as it were) in ſpight of Heaven continued, and aggravated our wickedneſſes: Alas, what excuſe is there for us? how can we do other then hang down our heads in a guilty confuſion, and expect a fearfull retributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the juſt hand of God?</p>
                  <p>Thus have we done to God, and whileſt we have gone away from him, hath he done other to us? Hath he not given too juſt teſtimonies of withdrawing his countenance from us? Hath he not for theſe many years croſſed us in our publick deſignes both of war and peace? Hath he not threatned to ſtir up evill againſt us out of our own bowels? Nay, which is worſe then all this hath he not given us up to a generall ſecurity, obduredneſſe, and inſenſible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart; ſo as we do not feel either our own ſins, or our dangers, or relent at all at his judgments? Alas, Lord, thou art too far off from us, and we have deſerved it; yea, we have too well deſerved that thou ſhouldſt turn thy face away from us for ever, that thou ſhouldeſt draw near to us in thy vengeance who have ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully abuſed thy mercy. But, what ſhall we ſay? Whatſoever we be, we know thou wilt be ever thy ſelf; a God of mercy and compaſſion, long ſuffering, and great in kindneſſe and truth; ſo bad as we are could we have the Grace to draw nigh to thee in an unfained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repentance, thou wouldſt draw nigh to us in mercy and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: Could we turne away from our ſins to thee, thou wouldſt turne away from thy judgments to us: Lord what can we do to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:97700:91"/>
thee without thee? Oh, do thou draw us unto thee, that we may come. Do thou enable us to draw nigh unto thee, upon the feet of our affections, upon the hands of our actions, upon the knees of our prayers, that ſo thou mayeſt draw nigh to us in thine Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in thine Audience, in thy grace and mercy, in thine Aid and Salvation. All this for thy mercy ſake, and for thy Chriſts ſake; to whom with thee, O Father, and thy good Spirit, one infinite God, be given all praiſe, honour, and glory now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>That this is particularly to be taken of the third perſon of the bleſſed Trinity, to whom this day is peculiarly devoted, there can be no doubt; for both the Title is his, <hi>The holy Spirit of God,</hi> not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, God, who is an holy Spirit, but the holy Spirit of God; and the effect attributed to him is no leſſe proper to him; for as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving of our Redemption is aſcribed to the Father, the atchieving of it to the Son: So the Sealing, confirming and applying of it to the Holy Ghoſt. There are many Spirits, and thoſe holy, and thoſe of God, as their Creator, and Owner, as the enumerable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Angels, and the Spirits of Juſt Men made perfect <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. but this is ſet forth, as <hi>Zanchius</hi> notes well, with a double Article, (<gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>It is a rule not capable of contradiction; that by how much more excellent the Perſon, ſo much more hainous is the offence done to him: As to offend an Officer is (in the eye of the Law) more then to offend a private Subject, a Magiſtrate, more then an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Officer, a Peere more then a Magiſtrate (for that is <hi>Scandalum Magnatum</hi>) a Prince more then a Peere, a Monarch more then a Prince: Now in very nature, a Spirit is more excellent then a Body, I could ſend you higher, but if we do but look into our own breaſts, we ſhall finde the difference: <hi>There is a Spirit in Man,</hi> ſaith <hi>Elihu, Job</hi> 32.8. <hi>The Spirit of Man is as the Candle of the Lord,</hi> ſaith Wiſe <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 20.27. without which the whole Houſe is all dark, and confuſed: Now, what compariſon is there betwixt the Soul, which is a Spirit, and the Body which is Fleſh, even this, which Wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in, may ſerve for all, <hi>The Spirit of a Man ſuſtains his infirmities, but a wounded Spirit who can hear?</hi> Lo, the Body helps to breed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and the Spirit bears them out; to which add; the Body without the Spirit is dead, the Spirit without the Body lives more: It is a ſad word of <hi>David,</hi> when he complaines: <hi>My bones are vexed: Pſ.</hi> 6.2. <hi>and cleaves to my skin, Pſal.</hi> 102.5. yet all this is tolerable, in reſpect of that; <hi>My Spirit faileth me, My Spirit is overwhelmed within me, my heart within me is deſolate, Pſal.</hi> 143.4. they were ſore ſtrokes that fetcht blood of our bleſſed Saviour, but they were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to theſe inward torments that wrung from him the bloody ſweat in his Agony, when he ſaid my ſoul is (<gap reason="foreign">

the Death; could we conceive that the Body could be capable of pain, without the Spirit, (as indeed it is not, ſince the Body feeles only by the Spirit) that pain were painleſſe; but this we are ſure of, that the Spirit feels more exquiſite pain without the Body in the ſtate of ſeparation from it, then it could feel in the former conjunction with it, and the wrong that is done to the Soul, is more haynous, then that which can be inflicted on the Body: By how much then more pure, ſimple, perfect, excellent the Spirit is whom we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, by ſo much more grievous is the offence; to offend the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of any good Man (one of Chriſts little ones) is ſo hainous, that it were <hi>better for a man to have a milſtone hanged about his neck, and to be caſt into the bottom of the Sea, Mat.</hi> 18.6.</p>
                  <p>To offend an Angel (which is an higher degree of ſpirituality) is more then to vex the Spirit of the beſt man; <hi>Suffer not thy mouth to cauſe thy Fleſh to ſin, neither ſay before the Angel that it was an errour: Eccleſ.</hi> 5.6.

                  <p>To offend therefore the God of Spirits, the Father of theſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Lights, muſt needs be an infinite aggravation of the ſin, even ſo much more as He is above thoſe his beſt Creatures; and there cannot be ſo much diſtance betwixt the pooreſt worme that crawles on the Earth, and the moſt glorious Archangel of Heaven, as there is betwixt him, and his Creator: One would think now, there could be no ſtep higher then this; yet there is; our Saviour hath ſo taught us to diſtinguiſh of ſins, that he tells us, <hi>All manner of ſin and blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven unto men, but the blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall not be forgiven, Matth.</hi> 12.31. and <hi>Marc.</hi> 3.29. Not that we can ſin againſt one Perſon, and not offend another; for their eſſence is but one; but this ſin is ſingled out, for a ſpecial obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of forgiveneſſe, for that it is done againſt the illumination, and Influence of that Grace, whereof the Holy Ghoſt is the immediate giver, and worker in the Soul, who is therfore called the Spirit of Grace: hereupon is <hi>Stevens</hi> challenge to the ſtiff-necked Jews, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.51. <hi>Ye do alwayes reſiſt the holy Ghoſt</hi>: And his charge to <hi>Ananias, Why hath Satan filled thy heart to lie to the Holy Ghoſt, Act.</hi> 5.3.

then how this charge riſeth, and what force is put into it, by the condition of the Perſon. A Spirit, the holy Spirit, the holy Spirit of God, enough to make way for the conſideration of the Act inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited: <hi>Grieve not the holy Spirit of God</hi>:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Grieve not, &amp;c.</hi> How incompatible are the termes of this charge? That which makes the ſin (as it is ſet forth) more ſinfull, may ſeem to make it impoſſible; If a Spirit, how is it capable of paſſion? and if it be impaſſible; how can it be grieved? Alas, we weak mortalls are ſubject to be hurried about with every blaſt of paſſion: The Almighty is above all the reach of theſe unquiet perturbations, Lo, that God, which mercifully condeſcended (becauſe his infinite glory tranſcends our weakneſſe) to ſpeak unto us men, by man, and by Angels in the forme of Men, ſpeaks to us men in the ſtyle, and language of Men: Two wayes then may the Spirit of God be ſaid to be grieved, in Himſelf, in his Saints; in himſelf by an <hi>Anthropopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie</hi> (as we call it;) In his Saints by a <hi>Sympathie</hi>; the former is by way of Alluſion to humane paſſion, and carriage; ſo doth the Spirit of God upon occaſion of mens ſins, as we do, when we are grieved with ſome great wrong or unkindneſſe. And what do we then? Firſt we conceive an high diſlike of, and diſpleaſure at the Act; Secondly, we withdraw our countenance and favour from the offender; Thirdly, we inflict ſome puniſhment upon the offence; and theſe are (all of them) dreadfull expreſſions of the grieving of Gods Spirit; even theſe three, diſpleaſure, averſion, puniſhment: For the firſt, <hi>Eſay</hi> expreſſeth it by vexation, <hi>Eſay</hi> 63.10.

Oh then, how ſhould we be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the ſence of the diſpleaſure of the holy Spirit of our good God, who as he is our beſt friend, ſo he is a moſt powerful avenger of wickedneſſe: Surely, we do ſo vex, and ſadden him with our grievous provocations, that he cryes out, and makes moan of his inſufferable wrong this way, <hi>Thou haſt made me to ſerve with thy ſins, and wearied me with thine iniquities, Eſa.</hi> 43.24. and <hi>Amos</hi> 1.13. <hi>Behold I am preſſed under you as a cart is preſſed, that is full of Sheaves</hi>; even ſo full that the Axeltree creaks, and bends and cracks again. It muſt needs be a great weight that the Almighty complaines of; and ſurely ſo it is: could our offences be terminated in men, and not ſtrike God thorough them, we might well ſay, that all the outrages, and affronts that we could put upon a world of men, were nothing to the leaſt violation of the infinite Majeſtie of God; and ſo doth the God againſt whom they are committed take them; by how much more tender the part is, ſo much more painfull is the blow; the leaſt wipe of the eye troubles us more then a hard ſtroak upon the back; it is eaſy to obſerve, that the more holy the perſon is, the more he is afflicted with his own, and with others ſin: <hi>Lot</hi> vexed his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Soul with the unclean converſation of the Sodomites; <hi>Davids</hi> eyes guſht out rivers of waters, becauſe men kept not the Law, how much more then ſhall the holy God (from whom theſe good men receive theſe touches of Godly indignation) be vexed to ſee and hear our profanations of his name and dayes, our contempt of his Servants and ordinances, our debauched lives, our malicious and oppreſſive practiſes, our wilfull diſobediences, our ſhamefull exceſſes, and uncleaneſſes, our uncharitable cenſures of each other, and all that

                  <p>This is that which Divines call, ſpirituall deſertion, A courſe which God takes, not ſeldome, when he finds a kind of reſtiveneſs and neglect in his Servants, or paſſage given to ſome haynous ſin againſt the checks of conſcience, where he intends correction, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and reclamation; the Spouſe in the Canticles, becauſe ſhe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened not inſtantly to her Beloved, findes her ſelf diſappointed, <hi>I opened to my Beloved, but my Beloved had withdrawen himſelf, and was gone, and my Soul failed me: Cant.</hi> 5.6.

Who would not be aſhamed to hear this fall from an Heathen, when he ſees how many Chriſtians live? but it is moſt true; A good man dare not ſin, though there were no Hell; but, that holy and wiſe God, that knowes how ſturdy and headſtrong natures he hath to do withall, findes it neceſſary to let men feel that he hath ſtore of Thunderbolts for ſinners, that he hath Magazins of Judgments, and

after all, an Hell of torments for the rebellious; and indeed we cannot but yield it moſt juſt, that it ſhould be ſo. If but an equall do grieve and vex us, we are ready to give him his own, with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and if an inferiour, we fall upon him with hand, and tongue, and are apt to cruſh him to nothing, and even that worm, when he is troden on, will be turning again; how can we, or why ſhould we think, that the great and holy God will be vexed by us, and pocket up all, our indignities? If a Gnat or Flea do but ſting thee, thou wilt kill it, and thinkeſt it good juſtice, yet there is ſome proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe Creatures and thee, but what art thou (ſilly nothing) to the Infinite?

from a perſonall to a nationall grieving of Gods Spirit) I am faln upon the grounds of thoſe heavy judgments, under which we have lyen thus long, groaning, and gaſping, to the pitty, and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our late envying neighbourhood; even the deſtroying, and devouring ſword; alas, my Beloved, we have grieved our good God by our havnous ſins of all ſorts, and now we do juſtly feel the heavy effects of his diſpleaſure; we have warred againſt Heaven with our iniquities, and now it is juſt with God to raiſe up war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, in our own Bowells. It was the Motto that was wont to be written upon the Scotiſh coine, as the embleme of their Thiſtle, <hi>Nemo me impune Laceſſet,</hi> None ſhall ſcape free, that provokes me; Surely it is a word that well fits the Omnipotent, and eternal juſtice, and power of Heavens; we have provoked that to wrath, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not hope to avoid a fearfull judgment; wo is me, we have made our ſelves enemies to God, by our rebellious ſins, <hi>therefore thus ſaith the Lord, the Lord of Hoaſts the Mighty one of Iſrael: Ah I will eaſe me of my adverſaries, and avenge me of mine Enemies: Eſa.</hi> 1.24.</p>
                  <p>Three things there are that aggravate the deep unkindneſſe, that God hath taken at our thus Grieving of him: his Indearments, our Ingagements, his Expectation: were we a people that God had no whit promerited by his favours, that he had done nothing for us, more then for the ſavage Nations of the World, ſurely the God of Heaven had not taken it ſo deeply to heart; but now, that he hath been more kind to us, then to any Nation under Heaven, how doth he call Heaven, and Earth to record of the juſtneſſe of his high re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, <hi>Hear O Heaven, and hearken O Earth, for the Lord himſelf hath ſpoken. I have nouriſhed, and brought up Children and they have rebelled against me: Eſa.</hi> 1.2. and excellently <hi>Jerem.</hi> 2.31. <hi>O generation, ſee the word of the Lord: have I been a wilderneſs to Iſrael? a land of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>; therefore it followes, <hi>Behold I will plead with thee, ver.</hi> 35. Neither are his indearments of us, more then our ingagements to him; for what Nation in all the World hath made a more glorious profeſſion of the name of God, then this of ours? What Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cope of Heaven hath been more famous, and flouriſhing? Had we not pretended to holineſs, and purity of religion even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond others, the unkindneſs had been the leſſe: now, our unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe calls God to the higheſt proteſtation of his offence, <hi>Be aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed

O Heavens, and be horribly afraid, be ye very deſolate, ſaith the Lord, for my people have committed two evils; they have forſaken me the Fountain of living waters, and have hewen them out Ciſternes, broken Cisternes that can hold no water, Jer.</hi> 2.11. <hi>And who is ſo blind as my ſervant: Eſa.</hi> 42.19. Now according to his Indearments, and our Ingagements hath been his juſt expectation of an anſwerable carriage of us towards him: the Husbandman looks not for a crop in the wild deſart; but where he hath Gooded, and plowed, and Eared, and Sowne, why ſhould not he look for an harveſt? And this diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment is a juſt heightner of his griefe, <hi>what could I have done more for my Vineyard that I have not done? I looked for grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes. And now I will tell you what I will do to my Vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and I will lay it wast: Eſa.</hi> 5.4, 5. Wo is me, we do not hear, but feel God making his fearfull word good upon us; I need not tell you what we ſuffer; the word of <hi>Eſay</hi> is fulfilled here, <hi>It ſhall be a vexation onely to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the report: Eſa.</hi> 28.19. Alas we know it too well, what rivers of blood, what piles of Carcaſſes are to be ſeen on all ſides, would God I could as eaſily tell you of the Remedy; and why can I not do ſo? Doubtleſſe, there is a remedy no leſſe certain, then our ſuffering, if we had but the grace to uſe it; too long, alas, too long have we driven off the applying of our redreſs; yet even ſtill there is Balme in <hi>Gilead,</hi> ſtill there is hope, yea aſſurance of help; if we will not be wanting to our ſelves: we have grieved our God to the height, Oh that we could reſolve to make our peace with our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked God at the laſt.

Oh that it could greive us thoroughly, that we have greived ſo good a God: that we could by a ſound and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious humiliation, and hearty Repentance reconcile our ſelves to that offended Majeſty; we ſhould yet live to praiſe him for his mercifull deliverance, and for the happy reſtauration of our peace, which God for his mercies ſake vouchſafe to graunt us.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſelme, Aquinas, Estius,</hi> and other latter Interpreters have juſtly conſtrued one branch of this offence of the Holy Spirit to be, when through our leud, deſpightful words or actions, we grieve and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize thoſe Saints and Servants of God, in whom that Holy Spirit dwells.</p>
                  <p>It is true (as <hi>Zanchius</hi> obſerves well) that it is no thank to a wicked man that the Spirit of God is not grieved by him, even in perſon; he doth what he can to vex him; the Impoſſibility is in the Impaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of the Spirit of God, not in the Will of the Agent: But although not in himſelf, yet in his faithful Ones, he may, and doth grieve him: They are the Receptacles of the Holy Ghoſt, which he ſo poſſeſſes and takes up, that the injuries and affronts done to them are felt, and acknowledged by him: As when an enemy offers to burn, or pull down, or ſtrip &amp; plunder the houſe, the Maſter or Owner takes the violence as done to himſelf; We are the Temples, the Houſes wherein it pleaſeth the Spirit of God to dwell, what is done to us, is done to him in us; He challengeth as our Actions (The Spirit of God prayes in us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26.) ſo our Paſſions alſo; he is grieved in our grief; ſuch an intereſt hath God in his, that as Chriſt the ſecond perſon in the Trinity could ſay to <hi>Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me</hi>? So the Holy Ghoſt appropriates our injuries to himſelf. <hi>If ye be reproached for the Name of Chriſt, happy are ye</hi> (ſaith <hi>S.

                  <p>What an heavy complaint is that, which the Apoſtle makes to his Corinthians, concerning himſelf and his fellowes: <hi>I think</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that God hath ſet forth us the Apoſtles laſt, as it were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to death, for we are made a ſpectacle to the World, and to Angels, and to Men,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9. and verſe the 13. <hi>We are made as the filth of the world, the off-ſcouring of all things unto this day.</hi> Alas if this were the condicion of the bleſſed Apoſtles to be thus vilified, why ſhould it ſeem ſtrange to us, their unworthy ſucceſſours, and Diſciples, if we be thought fit for nothing but to be caſt upon the dunghill: but theſe reproaches, however we may take coolly, and calmly, as that Stoick Philoſopher did, who whilſt he was diſcourſing of being free from paſſions (it being the doctrine of that ſect, that a wiſe man ſhould be impaſſionate) a rude fellow ſpat purpoſely in his face, and when he was asked, whether he were not angry; anſwered, no truly, I am not angry, but I doubt whether I ſhould not be angry at ſuch an abuſe; but there is a God that will not put up our contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melies ſo, we ſtrike his ſervants on Earth, and he feels it in Heaven, It is very emphaticall which the Apoſtle hath to this purpoſe, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.24. <hi>I fill up (that which is behind) <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Now as the holy Spirit of God both in himſelf and in his Children, is grieved with our leud ſpeeches, and offenſive carriage, ſo contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, God, and his holy Spirit are joyed in our gracious ſpeeches, and holy converſation, <hi>Luc.</hi> 15.10. <hi>I ſay unto you, there is joy in the preſence of the Angels of God, over one ſinner that repenteth:</hi> Lo this is Gods joy and the Angels witneſſe it, it is the owner that hath found the loſt Groate, and that ſaith Rejoyce with me: how doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable and godly behaviour, and holy Communication make Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick in Heaven.</p>

                  <p>It is the higheſt conſideration in the World, this, how doth God relliſh my actions and me? The common rule of the World is, what will men ſay? what will my neighbours? what will my ſuperiours? what will poſterity? and according to their conceits we are willing to regulate our carriage: but a true Chriſtian looks higher, and for every thing he ſayes or does, inquires after the cenſure or allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God himſelf, ſtill caring that the words of his mouth, and the meditations of his heart may be accepted of his God: and if his heart tell him, that God frownes at his actions, all the World cannot chear him up; but he will go mourning all the day long, till he have made his peace, and ſet even termes between God and his Soul: but if that tell him all is well, nothing in the world can deject and diſhearten him; but he takes up that reſolution which <hi>Solomon</hi> gives for advice, <hi>Let thy Garments be white, and let no Oyle be wanting to thine head, go thy way, Eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy Wine with a merry heart, for now God accepteth thy works, Eccleſ.</hi> 9.7, 8.

Dear Chriſtians let every one of us look in what termes he ſtands with his God, do we finde the face of God clouded from us, let our ſouls refuſe comfort till we have recovered his favour, which is better then life; do we find our ſelves upon our ſound repentance, received to grace and favour of the Almighty, and that he is well pleaſed with our perſons, and with our poor obediences, and that he ſmiles upon us in Heaven, courage, dear Brethren, in ſpight of all the frowns and menaces of the World; we are ſafe and ſhall be happy: here is comfort for us in all tribulation 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4. with that choſen veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, we are troubled on every ſide, yet not diſtreſſed; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thoſe that are great and good, we would not willingly offend, though meer ſtrangers to us: but if they be beſides, our great friends and liberal Benefactors, men that have deſerved highly of us, we juſtly hold it a foul ſhame, and abominable ingratitude, wilfully to

do ought that might affront them. It is therefore added for a ſtrong diſſwaſive from Grieving the Spirit of God, that by him we are ſealed to the day of redemption: All the world ſhall in vain ſtrive to do for us, what our great Friend in Heaven hath done; our loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs therefore to grieve him, muſt be according to the depth of our obligation to him: Caſt your eyes then a little upon the wonderful Benefit here ſpecified; and ſee, Firſt, what this <hi>day of Redemption</hi> is: Secondly, what is the <hi>ſealing</hi> of us to this day: and Thirdly, why the ſealing of us to this day ſhould be a ſufficient motive to withhold us from <hi>grieving the Holy Spirit of God.</hi> Theſe three muſt be the limits of my Speech and your Atrention.</p>
                  <p>Redemption ſignifies as much as a Ranſome; A Ranſome implies a Captivity or Servitude; There is a threefold Captivity from which we are freed; Of Sin, of Miſery, of Death: For the firſt, <hi>We are ſold under ſin,</hi> ſaith our Apoſtle: No Slave in <hi>Argier</hi> is more truly ſold in the Market under a Turkiſh Pyrate, then we are naturally ſold under the Tyranny of ſin; by whom we are bound hand and foot, and can ſtir neither of them towards God; and dungeon'd up in the darkneſs of our ignorance, without any Glimpſe of the viſion of God, For the ſecond; the very name of Captivity implyes Miſery enough; what outward evil is incident into a man which bondage doth not bring with it? Wo is me, there was never ſo much captivity in this land ſince it was a Nation, nor ſo woful a Captivity as this, of brethren to brethren; Complaints there are good ſtore on both ſides; of reſtraint, want, ill-lodging, hard and ſcant diet, Irons, inſultations, ſcornes, and extremities of ill uſage of all kindes: and what other is to be found in the whole courſe of this wretched life of ours, the beſt whereof is vanity, and the worſt infinite vexations; But Thirdly, if ſome men have been ſo exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally happy, as to avoid ſome of theſe miſeries (for all men ſmart not alike) yet never man did or can avoid the third; which is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxiouſneſs to death: <hi>By the offence of one,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>judgment came upon all men to condemnation Rom.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Sin hath raigned unto death, Pſ.</hi> 21. It is more then an Ordinance, a ſtatute law in Heaven; <hi>Statutum est, &amp;c. It is enacted to all men once to dye, Heb.</hi> 9.27. This then is our bondage or captivity, now comes our redemption from all theſe at once: when upon our happy diſſolution we are freed from ſin, from miſery, from death; and enter into the poſſeſſion
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:97700:101"/>
of glory: thus our Saviour, <hi>Lift up your heads, for the day of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption draweth nigh</hi>; thus ſaith St. <hi>Paul, The creature it ſelf alſo ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption unto the glorious liberty of the Sons of God. Rom.</hi> 8.21. It is the ſame condition of the members of Chriſt, which was of the head, that they overcome death by dying; when therefore the bands of death are looſed, and we are fully freed from the dominion of the firſt death, and danger of the ſecond, and therein from all the capacity, not only of the rule and power of ſin, but of the life and in-dwelling of it; and from all the miſeries both bodily and ſpirituall that attend it; and when in the ſame inſtant our ſoul takes poſſeſſion of that glory, which ſhall once, in the conſociation of it's glorious partner, the body, be perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated: Then, and not till then is the day of our redemption. Is there any of us therefore that complaines of his ſad and hard conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here in the world; paines of body, grief of mind, agonies of ſoul, croſſes in eſtate, diſcontentments in his families, ſuffering in his good name? let him bethink himſelf where he is; this is the time of his cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; and what other can be expected in this caſe? Can we think there is no difference betwixt liberty &amp; bondage? Can the ſlave think to be as free as his Patron? Eaſe, reſt, liberty muſt be lookt for elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; but whiles we are here we muſt make no account of other then theſe varieties of miſery: our redemption ſhall free us from them all. But now perhaps ſome of you are ready to ſay of the Redemption, as they did of the Reſurrection, that it is paſt already; and ſo indeed it is, one way; in reſpect of the price laid out by the Son of God; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable price of his blood for the redemption of man; but ſo, that it muſt be taken out by, and applied to, every ſoul inparticular, if we will have the benefit redound to us; It is his Redemption be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is now only our Redemption, when it is brought home to us.</p>
                  <p>Oh then the dear and happy day of this our finall redemption, wherein we ſhall be abſolutely freed from all the miſerable ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, paines, cares, fears, vexations which we meet withall here below, and, which is yet more, from all the danger of ſinning, which now every day adds to the fearfulneſs of our account; and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from the wofull wages of ſin, Death, bodily, ſpirituall, eternall; here is a redemption worth our longing for; worth our joying in: when <hi>Joſeph</hi> was fetcht out of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Gaol, and changed the naſty rags of his priſon for pure linnen veſtures; and his Iron fetters for
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:97700:102"/>
a chain of Gold, and his wooden ſtocks for <hi>Pharaohs</hi> ſecond Charet (<hi>Gen.</hi> 41.42.) do we not think he muſt needs be joyfully affected with it? When <hi>Peter</hi> was called up from betwixt his Leopards (as that Father termes them) and had his ſhackles ſhaken off, and was brought through the Iron gates into the free and open ſtreet; or when <hi>Daniel</hi> was called out of the lyons den to the embracements of <hi>Darius,</hi> could he chooſe but rejoyce in the change? when <hi>Lazarus</hi> was called (after three dayes entombing) out of his grave, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted his mourning ſiſters, and walk't home with his friends, could there be ought but the voice of joy and gladneſſe among them? But, alas, all theſe are but ſleight reſemblances of the bleſſed Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is purchaſed for us, who are thus ranſomed from ſin, and death: Rather, if we could imagine the ſoul of a <hi>Trajan</hi> fetcht out of hell by the prayers of <hi>Gregory,</hi> or of a <hi>Falconella</hi> by <hi>Tecla,</hi> according to the bold legends of lying fablers, and now freed from thoſe intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and unconceiveable torments, we might apprehend in ſome meaſure what it is that is wrought for our ſouls, in this mercifull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; and what is the favour of that deliverance, which we muſt long to have fully perfected: But, alas, what ſhall I ſay to us? We are enſlaved, and fettered, and we are loath to be free; we are in love with our bonds, with our miſeries, with our ſins; and when death comes like a good <hi>Ebed-molech</hi> to drag us up out of our dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, we are unwilling to put the rags under our arme-pits, and to lay hold of that our ſure, and happy conveyance to the light and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Saints: Oh our wretched unbelief that is guilty of this ſlackneſs of our deſires; whereas if we were what we profeſs our ſelves, we would think the time long till it be accompliſhed, and ſay, Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly; even ſo, come Lord Jeſus, come quickly, and make up our full redemption from miſery, from ſin, from death, and bring us into that glorious liberty of the Sons of God,</p>
                  <p>This, for the <hi>day of our redemption</hi>; now Secondly let us ſee what this <hi>ſealing</hi> is <hi>to the day of Redemption.</hi> I find in Gods book three uſes of a ſeal; 1. For ſecrecy, 2. For peculiar deſignation. 3. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and aſſurance.</p>
                  <p>For ſecrecy firſt; So God ſpeaking of the condition of Iſrael, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.34. <hi>Is not this laid up in ſtore, and ſealed up among my treaſures?</hi> So <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaking of a viſion of his; <hi>It ſhall be as the letter of a book

A ſtrange height of expreſſion, to give the World aſſurance of the cloſe carriage of their auricular Confeſſion; and that not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out need; for were it not for this perſwaſion their hearths might cool, and men would keep their own counſell: and ſurely, not to meddle with their tyrannicall impoſitions upon the conſcience, in their forced confeſſions, which we do juſtly call <hi>carnificinam conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae</hi>; I ſhould hold and profeſs, that if a man ſhould come in the anguiſh of his ſoul for ſome ſin, to unload his heart ſecretly to the boſom of his Miniſter, of whom he looks for counſell and comfort, if in ſuch a caſe that Miniſter ſhould reveale that ſin to any other whoſoever, no death were torment enough for ſuch a ſpirituall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſneſſe: all ſecrets are at the leaſt <hi>ſub ſigillo fidei,</hi> under the ſeal of fidelity, and therefore not to be revealed.</p>
                  <p>For peculiar deſignation; thus our bleſſed Saviour ſpeaking of himſelf, the Son of man, adds, <hi>For him hath God the Father ſealed, Joh.</hi> 6.27. that is; hath deſigned him to the ſpeciall office of his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſhip: So <hi>Revelation.</hi> 7.5. <hi>Of the tribe of Juda were ſealed twelve

                  <p>But the chief uſe of the ſeale is for certainty and aſſurance; ſo <hi>Jezebel,</hi> to make ſure work with the Elders of <hi>Jezreel</hi> for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of <hi>Naboth, ſealed it with Ahabs ſeale,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings.</hi> 21. ſo the Jewiſh Princes, Prieſts, and Levites when they had made their covenant, ſealed it with their ſeales, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. the laſt verſe.

And ſtill this is our practiſe, that which we would make ſure, and paſt all queſtion, we give not under our hand onely, but our ſeal alſo.</p>
                  <p>In all theſe three regards of ſecrecy, peculiar deſignation, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, the Church is <hi>ſons obſignatus, a well ſealed up, Cant.</hi> 4.12. and ſhe juſtly prayes, <hi>Set me as a Seal upon thine heart, and a Seal upon thine arme Cant.</hi> 8.6.</p>
                  <p>Let us take them ſeverally into our thoughts: and firſt for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy; It is a ſure word which the Spirit of God hath, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. <hi>The foundation of God remaineth ſure, having this ſeal; The Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth who are his</hi>; The Lord knoweth and none but he; neither Man nor Angel: It is ſealed on purpoſe, that it may be concealed, and reſerved only in the counſel of the moſt High: It is therefore a moſt high and dangerous preſumption in any man to paſſe a judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the final eſtate of another, eſpecially to the worſe part; This is no other then to ruſh into the Cloſet of the Higheſt, and to break o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his cabinet, and to tear up the privy Seal of Heaven; an inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that God will not paſſe over unrevenged: It was a good an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that the Servant gave in the ſtory, who carrying a covered diſh through the Street, and being asked what it was, anſwered, It is therefore covered that thou mayeſt not know; and ſo it is here; the final eſtate of every Soul is ſealed, that it may be known only to the God of Heaven: and if any man dare to pry into this Ark of God, with the men of <hi>Bethſhemeſh,</hi> let him fear to be ſtruck dead as they were, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. The Romaniſts have taken too much bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe this way: there is one of their Saints, St. <hi>Matilda,</hi> or St. <hi>Maude</hi>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:97700:103"/>
a Propheteſſe of theirs, which in her Revelations profeſſeth that ſhe would needs know of God what became of the Souls of four men; <hi>Sampſon, Solomon,</hi> (whom I muſt tell you the greateſt part of the Romiſh Doctors give out for a caſt away, very injuriouſly, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitably, ſince that beſides his being a type of Chriſt, and a pen-man of ſome part of holy Scripture, his <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> is a plain publication to all the World, of his penance for his former miſcarriages) <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Trajane</hi>: and received this anſwer; What my pitty hath done with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> I will not have known, that men may not be incouraged to take revenge on their enemies: what my mercy hath done with <hi>Solomon</hi> I will not have known leſt men ſhould take too much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to carnal ſins: What my bounty hath done with <hi>Origen</hi> I would not have known, leſt men ſhould put too much confidence in their knowledg; What my liberality hath done with <hi>Trajan,</hi> I would not have known for the advancement of the Catholick faith, leſt men ſhould ſleight the Sacrament of Baptiſm; a preſumptious queſtion, and an anſwer anſwerable. So they have not ſtuck to tell us, that the ſame day that their St. <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> dyed, there dyed in all the World three thouſand thirty and three; whereof 3000. went to Hell; thirty to Purgatory, and three (whereof their Saint was one) to Heaven; ſure I think much alike: I will not weary you with their frenzies of this kind; they have bragg'd of ſome of their Saints who have had this deep inſight into the hearts of men, and counſels of God, that they could tell by the view who ſhould be ſaved, who condemned; and ſome fanatick Spirits in our Church have gone ſo farr as to take upon them (as ſome vain Palmeſters by the ſight of the hand to judge of fortunes) by the face, and words, and garbe, and carriage of men to paſſe ſentence of reprobation upon other mens ſouls: what an horrible inſolence is this in any creature under Heaven, or in it? There may be perhaps grounds to judg of a mans preſent condition; God doth not call any man to ſtupidity, or unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſſe; If I ſee a man live debauchedly in drunkenneſſe, in whoring, in profeſſed profaneſſe: If I hear him in his ordinary ſpeeches to tear Gods name in pieces with oaths and bſaſphemies, I may ſafely ſay that man is in a damnable condition; and muſt demean my ſelf to him accordingly, forbearing an entire converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him; <hi>with ſuch a one eat not,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; but if I ſhall preſume to judg of his finall eſtate, I may incur my own condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:97700:104"/>
in pronouncing his <hi>Judg not that ye be not judged:</hi> Perhaps that man whom thou ſentenceſt, is in the ſecret counſel of God ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to life; and ſhall go before thee to Heaven: who that had ſeen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſes</hi> revelling in his Idolatry, Magick, Murder, worſhiping all the hoaſt of Heaven, polluting the houſe of God with his abominable altars, uſing ſorceries, and inchantments, filling the ſtreets of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with innocent blood (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.) would not have ſaid there is a caſt-away? Yet howſoever the hiſtory of the Kings leaves him in his ſin, and diſhonor, yet in the 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. You find his converſion, his acceptation, his prayer, and how God was entreated of him; <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. So as for ought we know, he lived a Devil and dyed a Saint. Who that had ſeen and heard <hi>Soul</hi> breathing out threatnings, and executing his bloody cruelties upon the Church of God, dragging poor Chriſtians to their judgments and executions, would not have given him for a man branded for hell? yet behold him a choſen veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, the moſt glorious inſtrument of Gods name that hath been ſince Chriſt left the earth: as thou loveſt thy Soul therefore, meddle not with Gods ſeal; leave that to himſelf: Thou mayeſt read the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of a man if thou wilt; and judge of his outſide, but take heed of going deeper: look well to the ſeal that God hath ſet upon thine own ſoul; look for that new name which none can read but he that hath it; this is worth thine enquiry into; and God hath given thee the Characters whereby to decipher it; <hi>whom he did predestinate, them alſo he called, and whom he called them alſo he juſtifyed, and whom he juſtified, them alſo he glorified</hi>; that is, they are as ſure to be glorified as if they were glorified already, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. Read thine own name in the book of life, and thou art happy; as for others, let thy rule be the judgment of charity; and let Gods ſeal alone: Secret things belong to God; and things revealed to us, and our children; but if thou wilt needs be ſearching into Gods counſel, remember that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> as the Vulgar reads it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.27. <hi>Scrutator Majeſtatis opprimetur a gloria</hi>; He that pries into Majeſty, ſhall be overwhelmed with glory.</p>
                  <p>Now, that from the Secrecy we may deſcend to the Peculiarity of Deſignation: You know it in common practiſe in your trades and merchandiſe, that when a man hath bought a parcel of commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities he ſets his marke upon them; to diſtinguiſh them from the reſt in the warehouſe; ſo doth our God; he ſets a mark upon his own, whereby they are plainly differenced from others: And this mark,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:97700:104"/>
beſides the ſtampe of his eternal decree, is true ſanctification: By this then it is, that we are known from the World: As upon ſome large plain, where there are ſeverall flocks and heards feeding to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, every one knows his own by his mark. So the man with the writers inkhorne <hi>ſet a mark upon thoſe which mourned for their own ſins, and the ſins of their people, Ezek.</hi> 9.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore ſo farr from truth, that our ſanctification is no certain proof of our ſon-ſhip and of our intereſt in the covenant of grace; as, that there is no other beſides it: And indeed, what other can we inſiſt upon? Outward profeſſion will not do it; many a one ſhall ſay, Lord, Lord, with a zealous reduplication, which yet ſhall be excluded; And for pretended revelations, they are no leſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull; Satan oftentimes transforming himſelf into an Angel of light; <hi>A Zidkijeh</hi> thinks he hath the Spirit as well as any <hi>Michaiah</hi> of them all: our books are full of the reports of dangerous duluſions of this kind; whereby it hath come to paſs that many a one in ſtead of the true <hi>David</hi> hath found nothing but an image of clouts laid upon a bolſter ſtuffed with Goats hair, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.16. But this mark of reall ſanctification cannot fail us: It will ever hold good that which <hi>St. Paul</hi> hath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>So many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God</hi>: Nothing in this World can ſo highly concern us as this, to ſee and know whether we be <hi>ſealed to the day of Redemption</hi>: Would we know how it may be evidenced to us; look upon the impreſſion that Gods Spirit hath made upon our hearts and lives, if he have renewed us in the inner man, and wrought us unto true holineſs, to a lively faith, to a ſincere love of God, to a conſcionable care of all our actions; and to all other his good graces, doubtleſſe we are ſo ſealed, that all the powers of Hell cannot deface; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate this bleſſed impreſſion.</p>
                  <p>But the principal &amp; main uſe of this Seal is for certainty of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. If we have the word of an honeſt man, we believe it; but if we have his hand we make our ſelves more ſure: but if we have both his hand and ſeal we reſt ſecure of the accompliſhing of what is given, or undertaken. How much more aſſurance may we have, when we have the word of a God, whoſe very title is <hi>Amen, Rev.</hi> 3.14. &amp; whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are like himſelf, <hi>Yea and Amen,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. Alas, the beſt man is deceitful upon the balance; and his true ſtile is, <hi>Omnis homo mend ax,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man is a lyer. But for this God of truth, Heaven and Earth ſhall
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:97700:105"/>
paſſe away, before one tittle of his word ſhall fail; but when that promiſe is ſeconded by his Seal, what a tranſcendent aſſurance is here? It is the charge of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter; Give diligence to make your calling and election ſure,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. Sure, not in reſpect of God; whom no changes can reach; whoſe word is, I am <hi>Jehovah</hi>; my counſel ſhall ſtand; but in reſpect of our apprehenſion; not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the object only, which cannot fail, but even of the ſubject alſo: which if it were not fecible, ſure the Spirit of God would not have injoyned it, or impoſed it upon us; The Vulgar reads (<hi>Per bona opera</hi>) by good works. And indeed it is granted by <hi>Beza,</hi> and <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mier,</hi> that in ſome Greek copies it is (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) whereupon <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would fain take an advantage to prove his conjecturall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance; A ſtrange match of words meerly contradictory; for if but conjecturall, how can it be aſſurance? and if it be aſſurance, how only conjecturall? we may as well talk of a falſe truth, as a conjecturall aſſurance.</p>
                  <p>But that implication of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is eaſily blown over, if we conſider that theſe Good works, do not only comprehend external works, as almes-deeds, prayer, attendance on Gods ordinances, and the like: but alſo the internall acts of the ſoul: the Acts of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Acts of the love of God, the Acts of that hope which ſhall never make us aſhamed. Theſe will evidence, as our calling and election, ſo the certainty of both, and therefore are the ſeal of our Redemption. Let fooliſh men have leave to improve their wits to their own wrong; in pleading for the uncertainty of their right to Heaven; But for us, let us not ſuffer our ſouls to take any reſt till we have this bleſſed ſeal put upon us to the aſſuring of our Redemption and Salvation; that we may be able to ſay with the choſen veſſel; <hi>God hath ſealed us, and given us the earneſt of his Spirit in our hearts,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. If we have the grant of ſome good leaſe, or ſome goodly Mannor made to us by word of mouth, we ſtay not till we have gotten it under black and white; and not then, till we have it under ſeal; nor then (if it be a perpetuity) till we have live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and ſeizin given us of it; and when all this is done, we make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſecurely to enjoy our hopes; and ſhall we be leſſe carefull of the main-chance, even of the eternal inheritance of Heaven? Lo here all theſe done for us! Here is the word preaching peace and Salvation to all that believe; here are his Scriptures the internal
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:97700:105"/>
monuments of his written word, confirming it; here is the ſeal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it; here is the Livery and Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Lo, this is not a gueſſe, but an aſſurance (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) neither doth the Apoſtle ſpeak of his own ſpeciall revelation (as the Popiſh Doctors would pretend) but he takes all beleevers into the partnerſhip of this comfortable unfailableneſſe (nothing ſhall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate us) thus happy are we if we be <hi>ſealed unto the day of Redemption.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having now handled the parts ſeverally, let us (if you pleaſe) put them together, and ſee the power of this inference or argument: ye are by the Spirit of God <hi>ſealed to the day of redemption,</hi> Oh therefore grieve not that Spirit of God by whom ye are thus ſealed. The Spirit of God hath infinitely merited of you; hath done ſo much for you, as ye are not capable to conceive, much leſſe to anſwer in ſo Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly an obſignation; Oh then be you tender of giving any offence to that good Spirit; Do not you dare to do ought that might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe that loving and beneficent Spirit. Be not you ſo much your own enemies, as to give juſt diſtaſt to your good God. So as the force of the argument, as we intimated at the firſt, lies upon an action of unkindneſſe; affording us this inſtruction, that the ground of Gods Childrens fear to offend muſt be out of love and thankfulneſs; <hi>great is thy mercy that thou maist be feared,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt; he doth not ſay; great is thy mercy that thou maiſt be loved; nor, great is thy Majeſty that thou maiſt be feared; <hi>but great is thy mercy that thou maiſt be feared:</hi> baſe ſervile natures are kept in with feare of ſtripes, but the ingenuous diſpoſition of Gods dear ones is wrought upon by the tender reſpect to the goodneſs and mercy of that God who hath ſo infinitely bleſſed it. It is an emphaticall expreſſion that of St. <hi>Paul For the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us:</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. Lo, here is a kind of force and violence offered to the ſoul; but it is the force of love, then which nothing can be more pleaſing, neither will God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any other; it can be no will that is forced; God will not
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:97700:106"/>
break in upon the ſoul; but wins it with thoſe ſweet ſolicitations that are more powerfull then thoſe of fear: Men commonly run in a full carere towards Hell, it were happy that any thing in the world could ſtay them; but are there any of us that find a reſtraint upon our ſelves, in the midſt of our evill wayes, ſo as we make a ſtop in this pernicious courſe of our ſining? whence is it? Is it out of a meer fear of the pains of Hell, of thoſe eternall torments that abide for ſinners? This is little thank to them: Nature even in brute Creatures will teach them to affect their own preſervation; and to avoid thoſe things which will neceſſarily draw on their deſtruction; <hi>Balaams</hi> aſſe ſeeing the Angels ſword, will ſtrive to decline it; every ſlave will tugg hard to eſcape the laſh: but is it in a ſweet ſenſe of the mercies of God, who hath done ſo much for thy ſoul? is it out of a conſcience not to offend ſo holy and munificent a God, who hath purchaſed thee ſo dear, and <hi>ſealed thee up to the day of Redemption</hi>; now, thou haſt in thee a true generoſity of ſpirit; this argues thee to have the proper affections of a true child of God; for every child of God is ſpiritually good natur'd; It is not ſo with our natural children; A ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackfull <hi>Eſau</hi> knowes that his good Father cannot but be diſpleaſed with his Pagan matches; yet he takes him wives of the Daughters of <hi>Heth: Gen.</hi> 26.35. And an ambitious <hi>Abſalom</hi> dares riſe up in rebellion againſt his tenderly-loving Father; but grace hath other effects; the ſpirituall generation of Gods faithfull ones, are dearly affectionate to their Father in Heaven, and apply themſelves to all obedience out of meer love and duty. The Son, and the ſlave are both injoyned one work (God be thanked we can have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in this kind, that vaſſalage is happily and juſtly extinguiſhed as unfit to be of uſe amongſt Chriſtians) but where it obtaineth ſtill, the Son and the ſlave do one work, but out of different grounds; the Son to pleaſe his Father; the ſlave that he may avoid the ſtripes of an imperious Maſter, therefore the one doth it cheerfully and willingly; the other grudgingly and repiningly; the one of Love, and Gratitude, the other out of fear. This is a point worthy of our ſerious conſideration, as that which mainly imports our ſouls, what are the grounds of our either actions, or forbearances; we indevour ſome good duties, we refrain from ſome ſins; out of what princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples? Some there are that can bragg of their immunity from groſs ſins, with the proud Phariſee, <hi>I am no fornicator, no drunkard, no

murtherer, no lyer, no ſlanderer, no oppreſſour</hi>; And I would to God every one of you that hear me this day could in ſincerity of heart ſay ſo; But what is the ground of this their pretended inoffenſiveneſs? If it be only a fear of Hell, and of the wrathful indignation of that juſt Judge, thou canſt reap ſmal comfort to thy Soul in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; for this is out of meer ſelfe-love, and deſire to eſcape pain and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which is incident into the worſt of creatures: Even the evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits themſelves are afraid of tormenting, and deprecate the ſending them back to their chains: But if it be out of a gracious, and tender love to God; out of a filial fear of the diſpleaſure of a God that hath done ſo much for thee, this argues the diſpoſition of a true child of God, and may juſtly adminiſter comfort to thy Soul, in the time of thy trial: Oh that we could every one of us lay before our eyes the ſweet mercies of our God; eſpecially his ſpiritual favours; how freely he hath loved us, how dearly he hath redeemed us; even with the moſt precious blood of the Son of his love; how graciouſly he hath ſealed us up to the day of our redeemption? and that we could make this uſe of it to be a ſtrong retractive from any, even of our deareſt, and gainfulleſt ſins; Carry this home with you, dear bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I beſeech you, and fail not to think of it upon all occaſions when ever you ſhall finde your ſelves tempted to any ſin whatſoever of luſt, of exceſſe, of covetous deſires, have this Antidote rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in your boſomes, which good <hi>Joſeph</hi> had; <hi>How ſhall I do this great evill and ſin againſt God</hi>; As good <hi>Polycarpus</hi> that holy Martyr, when for the preſervation of his life he was urged to renounce Chriſt, ſaid; Fourſcore and ſix years have I been his ſervant, and he never did me hurt; and ſhall I deny my Soverain King that hath ſo graciouſly preſerved me? If out of theſe grounds thou canſt check thy ſins; and canſt ſay; Lord I have been care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full not to grieve thy good ſpirit, becauſe thou in thine eternal love haſt ſealed me thereby to the day of my redemption, be confident, that thy redemption is ſealed in Heaven, and ſhall in due time be manifeſted to thine inveſtiture with the eternall glory and happineſs which God hath prepared for all his; To the participation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that God who hath ordained us, in his good time mercifully bring us, for the ſake of the Son of his love, Jeſus Chriſt the juſt, to whom with the Father, and the bleſſed Spirit one infinite and incomprehenſible God be given all prayſe, honour, and glory, now and for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>

holy ſpirit, and to that ſon-ſhip of God, which in our Baptiſm we profeſs to partake of: we are all apt upon the leaſt cauſe to be proud of our parentage. There are Nations (they ſay) in the world, whereof every man challenges gentility, and kindred to their King; ſo are we wont to do ſpiritually to the King of Heaven. Every one hath the Spirit of God; every one is the ſon of God. It is the main errand we have to do on the Earth to ſettle our hearts upon juſt grounds, in the truth of this reſolution; and this text undertakes to do it for us, infallibly deciding it, that thoſe, and none but thoſe, <hi>that are led by the Spirit of God, are the Sons of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So as we need not now think of climbing up into Heaven, to turn the books of Gods eternall Counſell; nor linger after Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſmes and Revelations, as ſome fanaticall ſpirits uſe to do; nor wiſh for that holy Dove to wiſper in our ear, with that great <hi>Arabian</hi> impoſtour; but only look ſeriouſly into our own hearts and lives; and trie our ſelves thoroughly by this ſure, and unfailing rule of our bleſſed Apoſtle, <hi>So many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God,</hi> let my ſpeech, and your attention then be bounded in theſe three limits: Here is Firſt a priviledg, To be the Sons of God. Secondly a qualification of the priviledged, To be <hi>led by the Spirit.</hi> Thirdly an Univerſall predication of that priviledge upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons qualified; <hi>So many as are led by the Spirit of God are the Sons of God</hi>; I need not crave your attention, the importance of the matter challenges it. To the firſt then; it is a wonderfull and inexplicable priviledge, this, <hi>To be the Sons of God</hi>; no marvell if every one be apt to claim; <hi>The glory of Children are their Fathers, Prov.</hi> 17.6. How were the <hi>Jewes</hi> puffed up with that vain gloriation that they were the Sons of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and yet they might have been ſo; and have come from hated <hi>Eſau,</hi> or ejected <hi>Iſmael: what is it then to be the Sons of the God of Abraham</hi>? Ye know what <hi>David</hi> could ſay upon the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of matching into the blood royall; <hi>ſeemeth it a ſmall matter to you to be the Son in Law to a King</hi>? Oh what then is it to be the true born ſons to the great King of Heaven? The <hi>Abaſſins</hi> pride themſelves to be derived from that Son whom they ſay the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> had begotten of her by <hi>Solomon</hi> when ſhe went to viſit him; it is enough that it was Princely though baſe; how may we glory to be the true and legitimate iſſue of the King of glory? the great Lord in the Goſpell is brought in by our Saviour in his parable to ſay, <hi>They will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:97700:108"/>
my Son</hi>; and <hi>Amnons</hi> wicked kinſman could ſay to him, <hi>Why art thou, the Kings Son, ſo ſad?</hi> as if the ſon-ſhip to a King were a <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſedeas</hi> to all whatſoever griefe or diſcontentment. Neither is there matter of honour onely in this priveledg but of profit too; eſpecially in the caſe of the Sons of this Heavenly King, whoſe Sons are all heirs, as ye have it <hi>v.</hi> 17. with men indeed it is not ſo: Amongſt Gods choſen people the firſt born carryed away a double portion; but in ſome other Nations, and in ſome parts of ours, the Eldeſt goes away with all; as on the contrary others are ruled by the law or cuſtome of <hi>Gavell kind</hi> and the like inſtitutions; where either the youngeſt inherit; or all equally; but generally it is here with us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that old word concerning <hi>Iſaacs</hi> twins, the leſſer ſerves the greater. <hi>Johoſaphat</hi> gave great gifts to his other ſons, but the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to the Eldeſt, <hi>Jehoram,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.3. ſo as the reſt were but as ſubjects to their Eldeſt Brother; in the family of the higheſt it is not ſo; there are all heires; all inherit the bleſſings, the honours: as all are partakers of the Divine nature; and of every one may be ſaid by way of Regeneration, that which was eminently, and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſaid by the way of eternall generation of the naturall and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſentiall Son of God, Thou art my Son, I have begotten thee; ſo all are partakers of thoſe bleſſings, and happy immunities which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to their filiation and what are they? Surely great beyond the power of expreſſion; for firſt in this name they have a ſpiritual right to all the creatures of God? <hi>all things are yours,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; A ſpirituall, I ſay, not a naturall, not a civill right, which men have to what they legally poſſeſs; we muſt take heed of this errour which makes an Univerſall confuſion where ever it prevailes: all theſe earthly affaires are managed by a civill right; which men have whether by deſcent, or lawfull acquiſition: ſo as it is not for any man to challenge an intereſt, either <hi>ad rem,</hi> or <hi>in re,</hi> in the goods of another; but Gods children have a double claim to all they poſſeſs, both civill from men, and ſpirituall from God; <hi>The Earth hath he given to the Sons of men,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt; and men by juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, by purchaſe, by gift conveigh it legally to each other; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides which they have a ſpirituall right; for God hath given all things to his Son as Mediatour, and in and by him to thoſe that are incorporated into him; ſo as now in this regard every child of God is <hi>mundi dominus,</hi> the Lord of the World, as that Father truly ſaid;</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:97700:108"/>Secondly, they have in this name an intereſt in God himſelf (for what nearer relation can there be, then betwixt a father and a ſon:) An intereſt in all his promiſes, in all his mercies, in all that he is, in all that flowes from him, in his remiſſion, protection, proviſion. Which of us earthly parents, if we extinguiſh not nature in our ſelves, can be wanting in theſe things to the children of our Loines? How much more impoſſible is it that he who is <hi>All love,</hi> 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 4.16. ſhould be wanting to thoſe that are his by a true regeneration. Hence is that enforcement, which God uſeth by his Prophet, <hi>Can a woman forget her ſucking child, that ſhe ſhould not have compaſſion on the ſon of her womb; yea they may forget, yet will not I forget thee: Behold I have grav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en thee upon the palms of my hands, Eſay</hi> 59.15, 16.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hence followes an unqueſtionable right in attendance and Guardianſhip of the bleſſed Angels, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.11. They are the little ones whereof our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. the eſpecial charge whom thoſe glorious Spirits are deputed to attend, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.14. And oh what an honor is this, that we are guarded by creatures more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in nature, more excellent in place and office, then our ſelves? What a comfortable aſſureance is this that we have theſe troopes of Heavenly Souldiers pitching their tents about us; and ready to ſave-guard us from the malice of the principalities and powers of darkneſſe?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly in this name they have a certain, and unfailable claim to eternal glory; For what is that but <hi>the inheritance of the Saints, Coloſ.</hi> 1. Who ſhould have your Lands but your heirs, and Lo, theſe are the heirs of God; and none but they: <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdome prepared for you</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.34. Many a one here is borne to a fair eſtate, and is ſtrip't of it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the juſt diſherſon of his offended Father, or elſe by the power, or circumvention of an adverſary, or by his own miſ-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and unthriftineſs; here is no danger of any of theſe. On our Fathers part, none, <hi>For whom he loves, he loves to the end:</hi> On our Adverſaries part, none, <hi>None ſhall take them out of my hand,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>The gates of Hell ſhall not prevaile against his:</hi> On our part, none; For whereby can we laviſh out our eſtate but by our ſins, <hi>and he that is borne of God ſinneth not</hi>; ſinneth not ſo as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr a forfeit; he may ſo ſin as to be frowned on for the time, to be chid, yea perhaps to be well whipped of his Father, not ſo as to be
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:97700:109"/>
unſonned, or diſ-herited: For the ſeed of God remains in him; Lo whiles he hath the Divine ſeed in him he is the Son of God, and whiles he is a Son he cannot but be an heir: Oh then the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and bleſſed priviledges of the Sons of God! enough to attract and raviſh any heart; for who doth not effect the honour of the higheſt parentage, not under Heaven but in it? who can be but eagerly ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of the title of the Lord of the world, ſo cloſely yea to be intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the great God of Heaven and Earth, by an inſeparable relation to be attended on by thoſe mighty and majeſticall Spirits; and laſtly, to be feoffed in the all-glorious Kingdome of Heaven, and immortal crown of glory? None of you can be now ſo dull as not deſire to be thus happy, and to ask as the bleſſed Virgin when ſhe was told of her miraculous conception, <hi>Quomodo fiet iſtud?</hi> How ſhall this be? How may I attain to this bleſſed condition? This is a queſtion worth asking. Oh the poor and baſe thoughts of men! How may I raiſe my houſe? how may I ſettle my eſtate? How may I get a good bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain? how may I ſave or gain? how may I be revenged of mine enemy? whiles in the mean time we care not to demand (what moſt concerns us) which way ſhould I become the child of God? But, would we know this, to which all the World is but trifles? ſurely it is not ſo hard as uſeful, whoſe Sons we are by nature, we ſoon know too well. It is not enough to ſay, our Father was an <hi>Amorite,</hi> and our Mother an <hi>Hittite,</hi> or to ſay we are the children of this world, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.8. or <hi>a ſeed of falſehood, Eſay</hi> 57.4. or yet worſe the <hi>children of the night and darkneſſe,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.5. worſe yet, we are <hi>filii contumaciae the ſons of wilfull diſobedience,</hi> as the original runs, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. and thereby yet worſe, <hi>the ſons of wrath, Epheſ.</hi> 2.2. and which is the height of all miſeries, the Sons of death and eternal damnation; how then, how come we to be the Sons of God? It is the Almighty power of Grace that only can make this change: A double Grace; the Grace of Adoption, the Grace of Regeneration: Adoption; <hi>God hath predestinated us to the adoption of ſons by Jeſus Chriſt, Epheſ.</hi> 1.5. Regeneration; <hi>So many as received him, he gave them this power or right to be made the Sons of God; thoſe which are borne not of blood, or the luſt of the fleſh, but borne of God, John</hi> 1.12, 13. and that which referrs to both, <hi>Ye are all the Children of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus, Galat.</hi> 3.26. Shortly then if we would be Sons and Daughters of God (for the caſe is one in both, the ſoul
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:97700:109"/>
hath no ſexes, and in Chriſt there is neither male nor female) we muſt ſee that we be borne again; not of water only; ſo we are all ſacramentally Regenerated, but of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>If any man be in Christ he is a new creature,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. we muſt not be the men we were; and how ſhall that be effected? <hi>In Christ Jeſus I have begotten you through the Goſpell,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. <hi>He hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten us by the word of Truth, Jam.</hi> 1.18. This word is that immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſeed whereby we are begotten to God; let this word therefore have it's perfect work in us, let it renew us in the inner man; mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying all our evill and corrupt affections, and raiſing us up to a new life of Grace and obedience, then God will not ſhame to own us for his; and we ſhall not preſume in claiming this glorious title of the Sons of God: But if we be ſtill our old ſelves, no changlings at all, the ſame men that we came into the World, without defalcation of our corruptions, without addition of Grace, and Sanctification: Surely we muſt ſeek us another Father, we are not yet the Sons of God: But me thinks ere I was aware I am falling to anticipate my diſcourſe, and whiles I am teaching how we come to be the Sons of God, am ſhowing how we may know that we are ſo; which is the drift of this Scripture in the qualification here mentioned: <hi>So many as are led by the Spirit of God, are the Sons of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not enough for us (my beloved) to be the Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of God, unleſſe we know our ſelves to be ſo: for certainly, he cannot be truely happy, that doth not know himſelf happy: How ſhall we therefore know our ſelves to be the Sons of God? ſurely there may be many ſignes and proofes of it beſides this mentioned in my Text, or rather, many ſpecialties under this general. As firſt, Every Child of God is like his Father: It is not ſo in carnall Generation: we have ſeen many Children that have not ſo much as one lineament of their Parents; and as contrary to their diſpoſitions as if they had been ſtrangers to their loines and womb: In the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſon-ſhip it is not ſo, every Child of God carries the true reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of his Heavenly Father; as he that hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of converſation: Becauſe it is written, <hi>Be ye holy for I am holy,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15, 16. Well then, my Brethren, trie your ſelves by this rule; our Heavenly Father is merciful, are we cruel? Our Father is righteous in all his wayes, are we unjuſt? Our Heavenly Father is ſlow to anger, are we furious upon every
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:97700:110"/>
ſleight occaſion? Our Heavenly Father abhors all manner of evill: do we take pleaſure in any kind of wickedneſſe? certainly we have nothing of God in us, neither can we claim any kindred with Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, every Child that is not utterly degenerate, bears a filial love to his Parents, anſwering in ſome meaſure that naturall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the parent bears towards him; we cannot but know, that the love of God, our Heavenly Father, toward us is no leſs then infinite, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.13. what return do we make of love to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain? we can perhaps talk largely of our love to God, but where is the proof of it? Did we love our Father in Heaven as children, could we ſtrange our ſelves from his intereſt? Could we indure to ſee him wronged in all his concernments? to hear his ſacred and dread name blaſphemed? to ſee his Ordinances trampled upon, his meſſengers contemptuouſly uſed, his houſe and his day prophaned? would we not ſpit at that ſon that would put up ſuch indignities of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to his carnal Father? And why will we lay claim to a ſon-ſhip of God, if we can ſwallow ſuch ſpiritual affronts put upon our God?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, every not ill-natur'd, and ungracious ſon (as God hath none ſuch) bears a kind of awfull reſpect to his Father, both in what he doth, and in what he ſuffers. For his actions, he dares not to do any thing wilfully that may work his Fathers diſpleaſure; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thoſe things which he would not ſtick to do before a ſtranger, yet before his Father he reverentially forbeares to do; <hi>If I be a Father, where is my honour? Malac.</hi> 1.6. If then we be not awfully affected to the preſence of God, If we dare boldly ſin God in the face; it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues ſtrongly that we have no filial relation to him: For his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; A child will receive that correction from the hand of a Father, which he would never abide from a ſtranger: He that would be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to repay blowes to another man, takes ſtripes from a Father, and anſwers them onely with tears; Thus, if we be the Sons of God; we do ſubmiſſely undergo from his hand, what fatherly chaſtiſment he ſhall be pleaſed to lay upon us; but if we be ready to ſtruggle, and groyningly repine at his correction, it ſhowes we do not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him for our Father.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, a ſon as he is wholly at his parents diſpoſing: ſo he depends upon his Fathers proviſion, expecting ſuch patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony as his Father ſhall beſtow upon him; and waiting with
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:97700:110"/>
patience for ſuch childes-part as he can have no hope of from a ſtranger. If we do ſo to our Heavenly Father, leading the life of faith with him; caſting our ſelves upon his gracious providence for all good things of either World; and fixing our eyes upon that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious inheritance which he hath purchaſed for us above, we do evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſhow our ſelves to be the ſons of God; but what need we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other evidence of this bleſſed condition, then what is here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly laid down to our hands in my Text? <hi>So many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is it then to be led by the Spirit of God? The originall is (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) a word, which every Grammarian knowes to ſignifie both <hi>agi,</hi> and <hi>duci,</hi> to be led, or driven; ſo where it is ſaid by one E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt <hi>that Chriſt was led into the Wilderneſs to be temped, Mat.</hi> 4.1. Of another it is read; that he was driven, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.12. And though the vulgar reads it here <hi>qui aguntur,</hi> yet our Rhemiſts turn it, Thoſe that are led; noteing in the margin, out of <hi>St. Augustines</hi> true ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, that Gods children are not violently compelled againſt their wills, but ſweetly drawn, moved, and induced to do good; So as this word then implies; both an act of Gods Spirit working in us; and our complying with that act in an obedient and ready conformity thereunto: For wherever the Spirit of God is, it is not idle and ineffectuall, but it is ſtill directing and inclining unto good; and whoſoever is led by that Spirit, yields himſelf to the motions and guidance; <hi>Acti agimus,</hi> as the old word is. In all leading therefore, and ſo in this, there muſt be an hand to guide, and a foot to follow; good motions on Gods part, and motions in good, on ours; both theſe muſt go together, elſe there is no leading by the Spirit of God. It is not enough that good thoughts are injected into us by the holy Spirit; yea it is ſo farr from availing us, as that a man is ſo much the worſe for thoſe good motions he entertaines not, as the motions are more excellent, and divine; But thoſe good injections muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, imbraced, delighted in, and followed home in a conſtant and habituall practiſe, with a reſolute rejection, and deteſtation of the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Beſides that ſpirit of our mind (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.23.) which lodgeth in every breſt, every man is led by ſome ſpirit or other: One is led by a ſpirit of Errour (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.) and ſeduction in matter of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: Another by the ſpirit of giddineſs, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 19.14. into

wild fancies, and brainſick imaginations; another is led by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of bondage, to ſlaviſh fears, and afflictive horrours, as in the next verſe to my Text; another, by the ſpirit of the World, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. Another (and indeed all theſe) by the unclean Spirit, as he is uſually ſtyled, in the Goſpell; others which are all the regenerate are led by the Spirit of God: when our Saviour ſaid to his too fiery Diſciples, <hi>Ye know not of what Spirit ye are,</hi> he implies that of ſome ſpirit they muſt needs be: now there are thoſe that pretend to <hi>be led by the ſpirit of God,</hi> and are not. St. <hi>Paul</hi> could upon good warrant ſay, <hi>I truſt I have the Spirit of God</hi>; that truſt was (however he modeſtly expreſſes it) no leſſe then a certain knowledg; but a <hi>Zidkijah</hi> on the other ſide in a falſe preſumption can ſay, <hi>Which way went the Spirit of God from me, to ſpeak to thee</hi>?</p>
                  <p>I remember in the hiſtory of the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> of Munſter, one of thoſe illuminated companions of <hi>John Becold,</hi> and <hi>Onipperdoling</hi> is ſaid to have kill'd his own naturall Brother in the face of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; and profeſſed to do it upon a revelation from the Spirit, the night before; And what hereſies, and prodigious opinions have been ſet on foot, and maintained to the death under pretence of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation and warrant of Gods Spirit, who can be ignorant? Let us therefore enquire how a man may know, whether he be truly <hi>led by the Spirit of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt then the Spirit of God leads no man but in a right way: and what is that but the way of Gods Commandements? All o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wayes are wayes of our own, oblique and crooked, as deviating from the ſtraight line of righteouſneſſe: In them either we lead our ſelves, or Satan leads us; <hi>If any man be tempted; let him not ſay that he is tempted of God</hi>; God moves to holy duties, to juſt and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble actions, and none but them; for he cannot be contrary to himſelf: Is there any of us therefore that is carried on in a courſe of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, exceſs, diſobedience, oppreſſion, or any other ſin whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; Alas, we are led by a contrary ſpirit in the dark wayes that lead to death and Hell. It were blaſphemy to father theſe ſinfull miſ-leadings upon the holy Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Gods Spirit leads no man but by a juſt rule; That rule is the word of truth, in all matter of judgment that muſt direct us; uncertain and variable Traditions, private and ungrounded Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, which are any way croſſe to this recorded will of God are
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:97700:111"/>
the deceitful guides of the ſpirit of errour. If then any frantick or ſuperſtitious perſon, ſhall pretend any other direction then God hath given us in his revealed will; well may I ſay of him, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> dares ſay of an Angel from Heaven (if any ſuch could be guilty of that offence) Let him be Anathema.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Gods Spirit leads his ſweetly and gently, <hi>diſponit omnia ſuaviter,</hi> not in a bluſtring and hurrying violence, but by a leaſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and gracious inclination; ſo in <hi>Elijahs</hi> viſion; <hi>There was fire, wind, Earthquake, but God was in none of them</hi>; theſe were fit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratives for his appearance; <hi>but it was the ſtill ſoft voice,</hi> wherein God would be revealed, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.12. Thoſe that are carried with an heady and furious impetuouſneſſe, and vehemence of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in all their proceedings, which are all rigour and extremity; are not led by that good ſpirit, which would be ſtyled the ſpirit of meekneſs; who was pleaſed to deſcend not in the form of an Eagle, or any other ſoul of prey, but in the form of a meek and innocent dove.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Gods Spirit leads on in a conſtant way of progreſſion from grace to grace, from vertue to vertue, like as the ſun ariſes by degrees to his full meridian; whereas paſſion goes by ſuddain flaſhes like lightning; whereof the interruptions are as ſpeedy and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany as the eruptions; The very word of leading implies a continuance; neither can they be ſaid to be led on, that make no proceedings in their way; if either therefore we go backward, or ſtand ſtill in goodneſſe; if we promove not from ſtrength to ſtrength, we have no ground to think we are led by the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Fleſh and Spirit are ever oppoſite one to the other, and go ſtill contrary wayes, and lead to contrary ends; <hi>If ye walk after the fleſh, ye ſhall dye,</hi> ſaith our Apoſtle. Nature and Grace which have their hands in this manuduction both wayes, ſtand in perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al oppoſition to each other; If therefore we be led by our ſenſual appetite to do and affect that which is pleaſing to corrupt nature, we are led by that blind guid the fleſh, and if the blind lead the blind, it is no marvell if both of them fall into the pit of perdition; but if we mortify our evil and corrupt affections; croſſing and curbing our exorbitant and ſinful deſires, and bringing them forceably under the ſubjection of Gods Spirit: Now we may be aſſured to be led by the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:97700:112"/>Other particularities of diſcovery might be urged, whereby we might eaſily judg of our own conditions; but theſe are enow where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may try our ſelves, our guides and wayes: It is cleare then (to ſumme up theſe proofes of our eſtate) that only they who walk in the wayes of Gods commandements, who are directed by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Will and word of God; who are ſweetly inclined by the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious motions of his Spirit; who go on in a conſtant faſhion, through all the degrees of grace and obedience; who reſtrain their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural deſires and affections, ſubmitting themſelves wholy to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Holy Ghoſt; onely they (I ſay) are led by the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>Five ſorts of men there are, therefore, who, what challenge ſo ever they may pretend to make, are not led by the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, thoſe that go on in a known evil way; <hi>Lead me O Lord in the wayes of thy righteouſneſſe,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt: Lo, they are only the pathes of righteouſneſſe in which God leads us; the reſt are <hi>falſe wayes,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt juſtly calls them, which every good heart, and much more the holy God utterly abhors; wo is me that I have lived to ſee thoſe dayes wherein any that looks with the face of a Chriſtian ſhould maintain that ſins are no ſins to the faithful; and that he is the holieſt man that can ſin the boldlyeſt, and with the greateſt freedom from reluctancy: Did ever any man look for Heaven in Hell before? Did ever any ſeek for the greateſt good in the worſt of evils? This is not hereſie, but meer Deviliſme; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with yet, it ſeems, ſome ungrounded ſoules, are wofully tainted; God be merciful to them, and reclaim them ere it be too late from ſo damnable an impiety.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, thoſe that are led by their own vain imaginations, and illuſive dreams in the wayes of error; raiſing unto themſelves new and wild opinions, and practiſes, without any warrant from the written word of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, thoſe that are carried by paſſion, and diſtemper, though even in good waies, turning a religious heat into fury, and unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table rage.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, thoſe that make no progreſſe at all in good, but either decay in grace, or thrive not.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, thoſe that humour, and ſooth up corrupt nature, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only to fulfil the luſts of their own fleſh: All theſe, whereof God
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:97700:112"/>
knowes there are too many in the World, yea in the Church of God making a fair flouriſh of Chriſtianity, are nothing leſſe then led by the Spirit of God; and therefore can lay no claim to the ſtate or title of the <hi>Sons of God</hi>: which is inferred in the connexion of this qualification with the priviledg: being the third head of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, <hi>So many as are led by the Spirit of God, are the Sons of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Spirit of God, is God; neither is mention made here of the Spirit only, as by way of excluſion of the other perſons: No, what one doth, all do, according to the old maxime. All the external works of the Trinity are indiviſible; it is good reaſon then, that God ſhould lead his own, and ſo he doth: But here it will be fit for us to conſider How far this leading of Gods Spirit will argue and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince this ſon-ſhip, and whether every conduct thereof will do it?</p>
                  <p>There is a work of the Spirit of God at large; <hi>The Spirit of God fills all the World,</hi> ſaith the Wiſeman, <hi>Wiſdom</hi> 1.7.</p>
                  <p>Not ſo yet, as was the errour of <hi>P. Abailardus</hi> in <hi>Bernard,</hi> That Gods Spirit is <hi>anima mundi</hi> as the God of the World, not as the ſoul of the World: As in the ſtate of the firſt <hi>Tohu</hi> and <hi>Bohu,</hi> the Spirit of God ſluttered upon the Waters, as it were to hatch the creature which ſhould be produced, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. ſo doth he ſtill fill the world for the preſervation of this univerſſe: But in this all, he works in man eſpecially; <hi>There is a ſpirit in man,</hi> ſaith <hi>Elihu</hi> in <hi>Job</hi> 32.8. and the inſpiration of the Almighty giveth them underſtanding; yet this is not the leading of this holy Spirit, that we are in hand with; lower then this, there are certain common graces wrought in men by the Spirit of God; as ſome general iluminations in the knowledg of divine things; ſome good moral diſpoſitions, ſome reſtraints of evil inclinations and actions, which yet will never reach to evince our ſon-ſhip to God. How eaſily were it for me to name you divers Heathens which have been eminent in all theſe, and yet (for ought we know) never the nearer to Heaven; yet lower, there are ſome ſpeciall gifts of the Spirit which we call <hi>Chariſmata,</hi> rare endowments beſtowed upon ſome men, excellent faculties of preaching, and praying; power of miraculous workings (as no doubt <hi>Judas</hi> did caſt out Devils as well as the beſt of his fellow-A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles) gifts of tongues, and of Propheſie and the like, which do no more argue a right to the ſon-ſhip of God, then the <hi>Manuaries</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:97700:113"/>
skill of <hi>Bezaleel</hi> and <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oliab</hi> could prove them Saints; yet, laſtly, there may be ſenſible operations of the Spirit of God upon the ſoul in the influences of holy motions into the heart, in working a temporary faith, and ſome fair progreſſe in an holy profeſſion, and yet no ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; the world is full of ſuch glow-wormes, that make ſome ſhow of Spiritual Light from God, when they have nothing in them, but cold crudities that can ſerve for nothing but deceit.</p>
                  <p>Will ye then ſee, what leading of the Spirit can evince us to be the Sons and Daughters of God; know then that if we will hope for a comfortable aſſurance hereof: we muſt be efficaciouſly led by his ſanctifying Spirit, firſt in matter of judgment, ſecondly in our diſpoſitions, and thirdly in our practiſe.</p>
                  <p>For matter of judgment, ye remember what our Saviour ſaid to his Diſciples; <hi>When the Spirit of truth is come he will lead you into all Truth, John</hi> 16.13. That is into all ſaving and neceſſary truthes; ſo as to free us from groſſe ignorance, or main errour: Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver therefore is enlightned with the true and ſolid knowledg of all thoſe points of Chriſtian doctrine, which are requiſite for ſalvation, is in that firſt regard led by the Spirit; and in this behalf hath a juſt title to the ſon-ſhip of God, as contrarily thoſe that are groſly and obſtinately erroneous in their judgment of fundamental truthes, let them pretend to never ſo much holineſſe in heart, or life, ſhall in vain lay claim to this happy condition of the Sons of God.</p>
                  <p>For our diſpoſition ſecondly. If the holy Spirit have wrought our hearts to be right with God in all our affections; if we do ſincerely love and fear him, if we do truely believe in him, receiving him as not our Saviour only, but as our Lord; If our deſires be unfained towards him; If after a meek and penitent ſelf-dejection we can find our ſelves raiſed to a lively hope, and firm confidence in that our bleſſed Redeemer; and ſhall continue in a conſtant, and habitual fruition of him, being thus led by the Spirit of God, we may be aſſured that we are the Sons of God; for fleſh and blood cannot be acceſſary to theſe gracious diſpoſitions.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly for our practiſe, it is a clear word which we hear God ſay by <hi>Ezekiel, I will put my Spirit into the midſt of you; and will by it cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes, and keep my laws, Ezech.</hi> 36.27. Lo herein is the main <hi>criſis</hi> of a ſoul led by the Spirit of God, and adopted to this heavenly ſon-ſhip. It is not for us to content our ſelves to talk
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:97700:113"/>
of the lawes of our God; and to make empty and formal profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his name.</p>
                  <p>Here muſt be a continued walk in Gods ſtatutes; it will not ſerve the turne for us to ſtumble upon ſome acceptable work, to ſtep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide a little into the pathes of godlineſſe, and then draw back to the World; no my beloved, this leading of Gods Spirit muſt neither be a forced angariation (as if God would feoffe grace and ſalvation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us againſt our wills) nor ſome ſuddain protruſion to good, nor a meer, actual, momentany, tranſient conduction, for a brunt of holineſſe and away, leaving us to the ſinful wayes of our former diſobedience, and to our wonted compliances with the World, the Devil, and the Fleſh; but muſt be in a ſteady, uninterrupted, habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual courſe of holy obedience; ſo as we may ſincerely profeſſe with the man after Gods own heart, <hi>My ſoul hath kept thy Teſtimonies, and I love them exceedingly, Pſal.</hi> 119.67. Now then dear Chriſtians lay this to heart ſeriouſly; and call your ſelves ſadly to this triall: What is the carriage of our lives? What obedience do we yeild to the whole law of our God? If that be entire, hearty, univerſal, conſtant, perſeverant, and truly conſcientious, we have whereof to rejoyce; an unfailing ground to paſſe a confident judgment upon our ſpiritual eſtate, to be no leſſe then happy. But if we be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly failing in the unfained deſires and indevours of theſe holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, and ſhall let looſe the reins to any known wickedneſſe; we have no part nor portion in this bleſſed condition: Mark, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, how fully this is aſſerted to our hands, in this (ſaith the beloved Apoſtle) <hi>the Children of God are manifeſt, and the children of the Devil; whoſoever doth not righteouſneſſe is not of God, neither he that loves not his brother,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.10. Obſerve I pray you what teſt we are put to: ye hear him not ſay who ſo talks not holily, or who ſo profeſſes not godlineſſe; in theſe an hypocrite may exceed the beſt Saint; but whoſoever doth not righteouſneſſe: withall ſee what a clauſe the Diſciple of love ſuperadds to the mention of all Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe (<hi>neither he that loves not his brother</hi>) ſurely the Spirit of God is a <hi>Loving Spirit, Wiſdom</hi> 1.6. and St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath the like phraſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.30. To let paſſe then all the other proofes of our guidance by the ſpirit: Inſtance but in this one: Alas my Brethren what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of that charitable, and chriſtian carriage of men towards one another, which God requires of us and which was wont to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:97700:114"/>
amongſt Chriſtian compatriots. Wo is me, inſtead of that true and hearty love which our Saviour would have the Livery of our Diſciple-ſhip, the badg of our holy profeſſion, what do we ſee but emulation, envy, &amp; malice, rigid cenſures, and rancorous heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnings amongſt men? In ſtead of thoſe neighbourly, and friendly offices which Chriſtians were wont lovingly to performe to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what have we now in the common practiſe of men, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derminings, oppreſſions, violence, cruelty? Can we think that the Spirit of him who would be ſtyled <hi>Love it ſelf,</hi> would lead us in theſe rugged, and bloody pathes? No, no, this alone is too clear a proof how great a ſtranger the Spirit of God is to the hearts and waies of men; and how few there are that upon good and firme grounds can plead their right to the ſon-ſhip of God: Alas, alas, if theſe diſpoſitions and practiſes may bewray the ſons of an holy God, what can men do to prove themſelves the children of that helliſh <hi>Apollion,</hi> who was a man-ſlayer from the beginning? For us, my beloved: Oh let us hate and bewaile this common degeneration of Chriſtians; and as we would be, and be acknowledged the ſons of God, <hi>Let us put on as the elect of God holy and beloved, bowels of mercy, kindneſſe, humbleneſſe of mind, meekneſſe, long-ſuffering, forbearing one another, forgiving one another, if we have a quarrell againſt any; even as Chriſt forgave us; and above all theſe things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectneſſe, Coloſ.</hi> 3.12, 13, 14. And laſtly, forſak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the miſ-guidance of Satan, the World, and our corrupt nature which will lead us down to the chambers of death, and eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, let us yield up our ſelves to be led by the holy Spirit of God in all the wayes of righteouſneſſe, and holyneſſe, of piety, juſtice, charity, and all manner of gracious converſation, that we may thereby approve our ſelves the ſons and daughters of God, and may be feoffed in that bleſſed inheritance which he hath laid up for all his; to the poſſeſſion whereof may he happily bring us who hath dearly bought us, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous: to whom with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the bleſſed ſpirit, one infinite God, be given all praiſe, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and glory, now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Need not tell you that <hi>Solomon</hi> was a wiſe man, his wiſdom, as it was in an extraordinary meaſure put into him by him that is wiſdom it ſelf; ſo was it in a more then ordinary way improved by his diligent obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: his obſervation was Univerſal of times, things, perſons, actions, events: neither did he look his experiments up in the cloſet of his own breſt; but by the direction of Gods Spirit laid them forth to the World in this divine ſermon, which, not as a King, but as a Prophet he preach't to all poſterity. Every ſentence here therefore is a dictate of the holy Ghoſt; it is not <hi>Solomon</hi> then, but a greater then <hi>Solomon,</hi> even the holy Spirit of the great God that tells you there is not a time onely, but a ſeaſon too, for every thing and for every purpoſe under Heaven: that is (as I hope you can take it no otherwiſe) for every good thing, or indifferent; as for evill things or actions, if men find a time, yet ſure God allowes no ſeaſon: thoſe are alwayes damnably-unſeaſonable abuſes of times, and of our ſelves: not to meddle with other particulars: our thoughts are now by the divine providence pitch't upon, <hi>a time to weep, and a time to laugh, a time to mourn, and a time to dance,</hi> or rather onely upon the time to weep and mourn, for our time of laughing and dancing is paſt already: and perhaps we have had too much of that in our former times; which makes the cauſes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of our now weeping and mourning, as more uncouth, ſo
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:97700:115"/>
more intenſive: we muſt be ſo much deeper in our mourning by how much we have been more wild, and wanton in our laughter, and dancing. To fall right down therefore upon our intended diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe without any previous circumlocutions: There is a threefold time of juſt mourning. 1. When a man is ſenſible of his puniſhments. 2. Of his ſins, 3. Of his dangers.</p>
                  <p>Of his puniſhments firſt, or rather which is more general, of his afflictions: for all afflictions are not intended for puniſhments; ſome are fatherly chaſtiſments onely for our good, whereas all pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments are afflictive; when we are whip't then, when we ſmart with the rod, we have cauſe to weep, and if in this caſe we ſhed no tears it is a ſign of a graceleſſe heart. It is time therefore to mourn when we are preſſed by ſufferings, whether from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate hand of God, or mediately by the hands of men; whether by private, or publique calamities; are we ſmitten in our bodies by ſome painfull and incurable diſeaſes? Doth the peſtilence rage in our ſtreets? Hath God forbidden us the influence of Heaven and curſt the Earth with barrenneſſe? Hath he broken the ſtaffe of bread, and ſent leanneſſe into our ſouls? Hath he humbled us with the fearfull caſualties of fire or water? by wracks at Sea, by lightnings and tempeſts by land? hath he ſent murrain amongſt our cattle, and deſtroying vermine into our barnes, and fields? now God tells us it is a time to mourn; are we diſquieted in our minds by ſome over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſtering paſſions of griefe, for the miſcarriages of children, for the ſecret diſcontents of domeſticall jars, for unjuſt calumnies caſt upon our good name? are we moleſted in our mindes and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits with impetuous, and no leſſe importune then hatefull Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? now it is a time to mourn: do we find in our ſouls a decay, and languiſhment of grace, a prevalence of thoſe corruptions which we thought abated in us? Do we find our ſelves deeply ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick with our ſinfull indiſpoſitions? Shortly, do we find the face of our God for the time withdrawn from us? Now, now it is a time to mourn.</p>
                  <p>If we turn our eyes to thoſe evils which are caſt upon us by the hands of men: Do men find themſelves deſpoyled of their eſtates, reſtrained of their Liberties, tortured in their bodies? Do they find the wofull miſeries of an inteſtine war; killings, burnings, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populations? do they find fire and ſword raging in the boſom of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:97700:115"/>
out Land? now it is a time to mourn. Were theſe evils confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſome few perſons; to ſome ſpecial families, they were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the tears of our compaſſion; for it is our duty to weep with them that weep; but where they are univerſal, and ſpread over the whole face of any Nation, there cannot be found tears enough to lament them.</p>
                  <p>Puniſhments then are a juſt cauſe of our ſorrow and mourning; but to a good heart ſin is ſo much greater cauſe of mourning, by how much a moral evil is more then a natural; and by how much the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of an Almighty God is worthy of more regard then our own ſmart: Doth thine heart then tell thee that thou haſt offended the Majeſty of God by ſome grievous ſin? now is thy time to weep and mourne; as thou wouldeſt <hi>for thy only ſon</hi>;<note place="margin">

                  <p>Laſtly, as our ſufferings and our ſins make up a due time for our mourning, ſo do our dangers alſo; for fear is no leſſe afflictive then pain; yea I know not whether there can be a greater pain then the expectation of imminent miſchiefs: Do we therefore ſee extremities of judgments hovering over our heads, ready to fall down, like <hi>Sodoms</hi> fire and brimſtone, from heaven upon us; now is it high time to mourne for the anteverting of a threatned vengeance: ſhortly therefore, to ſum up all that we have ſpoken, whether we feel evils of puniſhment or fear them; or be conſcious of the evils of ſin that have deſerved them, we cannot but finde it a juſt time to <hi>weep and mourne.</hi>

                  <p>And now to come home cloſe to our ſelves; can any man be ſo wilfully blind as not to ſee that all theſe are met together to wring tears from us, and to call us to a ſolemn and univerſal mourning: What ſingle men ſuffer, themſelves beſt feel; and our old word is, The wronged man writes in marble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I meddle not with particulars: Our pains of body, our loſſes in our eſtate, our demeſtique croſſes, our wounds of Spirit as they are kept up in our own breaſts, ſo they

juſtly call us to private humiliations; if we caſt abroad our eyes to more publick afflictions; have we not ſeen that God hath let his ſea looſe upon us in divers parts of our Land? as if for a new judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon us, he would retract the old word of his decreed limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>Hitherto ſhalt thou come, but no further, and here ſhall thy proud waves be ſtayed, Job.</hi> 38.11. Hath not God given us in divers parts of our Nation a feeling touch of ſome of the Egyptian plagues, in the mortality of our cattle, in the unuſual frequencie of noyſome and devouring vermine: But wo is me, all theſe are but flea-bites in compariſon of that deſtructive ſword that hath gone through the Land, and ſheathed it ſelf in the bowels of hundred thouſands of brethren. <hi>Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the ſlain of the daughter of my People, Jer.</hi> 9.1. Was there ever a more fearful example of divine vengeance againſt any Nation then to be armed againſt each other to their mutual deſtruction: that Chriſtian compatriots, brethren, ſhould pour out each others blood like water in our ſtreets, and leave their mangled carcaſſes for compoſt in our Fields? That none but the ſharper ſword ſhould be left to be the arbiter of our deadly differences; that Fathers and Sons ſhould ſo put off all natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as to think it no violation of piety to cut the throats of each other: Oh that we have lived to ſee the woful havock that the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh fury of war hath made every where in this flouriſhing and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous Iſland; the flames of hoſtile furie riſing up in our Towns and Cities; the devaſtation of our fruitful and pleaſant Villages; the demolition of our magnificent Structures, the ſpoiles and ruines of thoſe fabricks that ſhould be ſacred, in a word, this goodly Land for a great part of it turned to a very <hi>Golgotha,</hi> and <hi>Aceldama</hi>: Theſe, theſe my brethren, if our eyes be not made of pumices, muſt needs fetch tears from us; and put us into a conſtant habit of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>And if our puniſhments deſerve thus to take up our hearts, where ſhall we find room enough for ſufficient ſorrow for thoſe horrible ſins that have drawn down theſe heavy judgments upon us?</p>

the preſent, let me have leave a little to lay before you (though it is no pleaſing object) that common leproſie of ſin, wherewith the face of this miſerable Nation is over-ſpread, whether in matter of practiſe, or of opinion: For the former, ſhould I gather up all the complaints of the Prophets which they have taken up of old againſt their <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Juda,</hi> and apply them to this Church and Nation, you would verily think them calculated to this our meridian; as if our ſins were thiers, and their reproofs ours: what one ſin can be nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all that black bedrole of wickedneſſe, reckoned up by thoſe holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly querulos cenſors, which we muſt not own for ours? Of whom do you think the Prophet <hi>Eſaiah</hi> ſpeaks, when he ſayes, <hi>Your iniquities have ſeparated between you and your God, and your ſins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear; for your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity, your lips have ſpoken lies, your tongue hath mutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perverſneſſe?

                  <p>I could eaſily tire you (if I have not done ſo already) with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious parallels of our ſins with Iſraels. Yet, one more, do we think of the bold intruſion of preſumptuous perſons into the ſacred calling, without any commiſſion from God? Of whom do we think the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſpeaks? <hi>The Prophets propheſy lies in my name, I ſent them not, neither have I commanded them, nor ſpake unto them: They propheſy unto you a falſe viſion, and the deceit of their own heart, Jer.</hi> 14.14. and again, <hi>I have not ſent theſe Prophets, yet they run, I have not ſpoken to them, yet they propheſyed. Jer.</hi> 23.21. To what purpoſe ſhould I inſtance in more? as I eaſily might; as practical atheiſme, falſehood, cruelty, hypocriſy, ingratitude, and in a word, univerſal corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: O <hi>England, England,</hi> too like to thy ſiſter <hi>Iſrael</hi> in all her ſpiritual deformities, if not rather to thy ſiſter <hi>Sodome. Behold this was the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of thy Siſter ſodome, pride, fulneſſe of bread and abundance of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was in her, neither did ſhe ſtrengthen the hands of the poor and needy, Ezechiel</hi> 16.49. Lo, thou art as haughty as ſhe, and haſt commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all her abominations; But that which yet aggravates thy ſin, is thy ſtubborne incorrigibleneſſe, and impudence in offending: is it not of thee that the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>This is a Nation that obeyeth not the voice of the Lord their God, nor receiveth correction? Jer.</hi> 7.28. For, O our God, haſt thou not whipt us ſoundly, and drawn blood of us in abundance; yet, wo is me what amendment haſt thou found in us? what one exceſſe have we abated? what one ſin have we reformed? what one vice have we quitted? Look forth brethren in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, ſee if the lives of men be not more looſe and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, their tongues more profane, their hands more heavily oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,

their converſation more faithleſſe, their contracts more frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent, their contempt of Gods meſſengers more high, their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of Gods ordinances more palpable then ever it was: Yea, have not too many amongſt us, added to their unreformation an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in ſinning? Is it not of theſe that the Prophet ſpeaketh; <hi>Were they aſhamed when they had committed abomination? Nay they were not aſhamed at all, neither could they bluſh, therefore ſhall they fall among them that fall, in the time of their viſitation they ſhall be cast down, ſaith the Lord? Jer.</hi> 8.12.</p>
                  <p>By this time I ſuppoſe you ſee how too much cauſe we have to mourn for thoſe ſins of practiſe which have fetcht down judgments upon us, turn your eyes now a little to thoſe intellectual wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes which we call ſins of Opinion; Opinion (think ſome of you now) alas what ſo great offence can there be in matter of conceit, and in thoſe reſults of ours ratiocination which we picht upon in the caſes of Religion? let me tell you, dear Chriſtians, what valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation ſoever you may pleaſe to ſet upon theſe capital errours of the underſtanding ſet abroach for the ſeduction of ſimple ſouls, there is more deadly miſchief, and higher offence to God in them, then in thoſe practical evils which honeſt hearts profeſs to abhorr; Theſe, as they are the immediate ſins of our ſpirituall part; ſo they do more immediately ſtrike at the God of Spirits in his Truth, and holineſſe; and as Religion is the higheſt concernment of the ſoul, ſo the depravation of Religion muſt needs be moſt dangerous, and damnable. It is no marvell therefore if a truly-zealous Chriſtian could even weep his eyes out to ſee &amp; hear thoſe helliſh hereſies, &amp; Atheous paradoxes which have poyſoned the very air of our Church wherein they were vented; One beats the keys into the ſword, or hangs them at the Magiſtrates girdle; ſo as he ſuſpends religion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the meer will and pleaſure of ſeveraignty: One allowes plurality, or community of Wives; another allows a man to divorce that wife he hath upon ſleight occaſions, and to take another: One is a Ranter, another is a Seeker, a third is a Shaker: One dares queſtion, yea diſparage the ſacred Scriptures of God; another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the Souls immortality, a third the Bodies reſurrection: One ſpits his poyſon upon the bleſſed Trinity; another blaſphemes the Lord Jeſus, and oppoſes the eternity of his Godhead; One is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for inſpirations, profeſſing himſelf above the ſphere of all
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:97700:118"/>
Ordinances, yea above the blood of Chriſt himſelf; Another teaches that the more villanie he can commit, the more holy he is; that only confidence in ſinning is perfection of ſanctity; that there is no hell but remorſe. To put an end to this liſt of blaſphemies the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mention whereof is enough to diſtemper my tongue and your ears; One miſcreant dares give himſelf out for God Almighty: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother for the Holy Ghoſt; Another for the Lord Chriſt, Another (a vile adulterous ſtrumpet) for the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>; O God, were there ever ſuch frenzies poſſeſſed the braines of men? as theſe ſad times have yieled? Was ever the Devil ſo prevalent with the ſons of men? Neither have theſe prodigious wretches ſmothered their damnable conceits in their impure breaſts, but have boldly vented them to the World, ſo as the very preſſes are openly defiled with the moſt loathſome diſgorgments of their wicked blaſphemies: Here, here my dear brethren, is matter more then enough for our mourning; If we have any good hearts to God, if any love to his truth, if any zeal for his glory, if any care for his Church, if any compaſſion of either periſhing or endangered ſouls, we cannot but apprehend juſt cauſe of pouring out our ſelves into tears for ſo hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible affronts offered to the dread Majeſty of our God, for ſo inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piable a ſcandal to the Goſpel which we profeſſe, for ſo odious a conſpurcation of our holy profeſſion, and laſtly, for the dreadful damnation of thoſe ſilly ſouls that are ſeduced by theſe curſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors.</p>
                  <p>Ye have ſeen now what cauſe we have of mourning for ſins both of Practiſe and Opinion.</p>
                  <p>It remaines now that we conſider what cauſe of mourning we may have from our dangers: for ſurely fear as it is alwayes joyned with grief, ſo together with it is a juſt provoker of our tears. And here if I ſhould abridge all the holy Prophets; and gather up out of them all the menaces of judgments which they denounce againſt their ſinfull <hi>Iſrael,</hi> I might well bring them home to our own doors and juſtly affright us with the expectation of ſuch further revenge from Divine Juſtice; for how can we otherwiſe think but that the ſame ſins muſt carry away the ſame puniſhments? The holy God is ever conſtant to his own moſt righteous proceedings; if then our ſins be like theirs, why ſhould we preſume upon a diſſimilitude of judgments?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:97700:118"/>Here then it is eaſy to deſcry a double danger worth our mourning for; the one, of further ſmart from the hand of God for our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing, and menacing wickedneſſe; the other of further degrees of corruption from our ſelves: For the firſt, let that ſad Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> tell you, what we may juſtly fear. <hi>They are not humbled e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto this day, neither have they feared nor walked in my law; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, the God of Iſrael, Behold I will ſet my face againſt you for evill, and to cut off all Judah, Jer.</hi> 44.10.11. and if ye will have particularities, have we not cauſe to fear that he will make good upon us that fearful word, <hi>I have taken away my peace from this people, ſaith the Lord, even loving kindneſſe and mercies? Jer.</hi> 16.5. This is an ablative judgment, and that a heavy one too; will ye ſee a poſitive one, more heavy then that? <hi>Behold I will ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly forget you, and I will forſake you, and the City that I gave to you and your forefathers, and caſt you out of my preſence. And I will bring an everlaſting reproach upon you, and a perpetual ſhame which ſhall not be forgotten. Jer.</hi> 23.39, 40. Will ye have the ſpecialities of his threatned judgments? <hi>Behold I will ſend upon them the ſword, the famine, and the peſtilence; I will perſecute them with all theſe, and will deliver them to be removed to all the Kingdomes of the Earth to be a curſe, and an astoniſhment and an hiſſing, and a reproach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all Nations. Jer.</hi> 29.17, 18. But enough, enough of theſe dolefull accents of interminated judgments, wherewith if I would follow the ſteps of the Prophets I might ſtrike your hearts with juſt horrour: See now the no leſſe danger that ariſes from our ſelves; no leſſe? Yea much greater; for the higheſt revenge of all other that God takes of men, is when he puniſhes ſin with ſin: Let me therefore ſadly and ſeriouſly tell you, that there is juſt fear we are running apace into two woful miſchiefs, Atheiſme and Barbariſme: Oh that I were a falſe Prophet, and did not ſee too much ground of this fear. The multiplicity of theſe wild opinions in matter of Religion, if there be not a ſpeedy reſtraint, can have no other iſſue, but no Religion: And if we ſhould live to ſee diſcouragements put upon Learning and a ſubſtract on or diminution of the maintenance of ſtudied Divines, and an allowance of, or connivence at unlet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered preachers; and no care taken of any but ſome ſelect ſoules, ignorance, confuſion, and barbarity will be the next newes that we ſhall hear of from the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:97700:119"/>Brethren, if we ſee not theſe cauſes of fear we are blind, and if ſeeing them we be not affected with them, we are ſtupid.</p>
                  <p>Let this be enough to be ſpoken of thoſe grounds that make a juſt time of our mourning: now that our ſeaſonable mourning may not be to no purpoſe; let us inquire a little how this our mourning ſhould be regulated for the due carriage and conditions of it: And firſt for the quantity of it; it muſt be proportioned to the occaſion and cauſe upon which it is taken up: for to mourne deeply upon ſleight and trivial cauſes, were weak and childiſh; like to thoſe faint hearts that are ready to ſwoun away for the ſcratch of a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: on the contrary not to mourne heavily upon a main cauſe of grief, argues an inſenſate and benummed heart.</p>
                  <p>If it be for ſome vehement affliction of body, good <hi>Ezekiah</hi> is a lawfull precedent for us, <hi>Like as a Crane, or a ſwallow ſo did I chatter; I did mourne as a dove, mine eyes fail with looking upward: Iſaiah</hi> 38.14. If it be for ſome great publick calamity, <hi>Jeremie</hi> tells you what to do; <hi>For this gird you with ſackcloth, lament and howl, for the fierce anger of the Lord is not turned back from us, Jerem.</hi> 4.8. and Gods choſen People are a fit pattern; <hi>The Elders of the daughter of Zion ſit upon the ground and keep ſilence, they have cast up dust upon their heads, they have girded themſelves with ſackcloth, the Virgins of Jeruſalem hang down their heads to the ground, Lament.</hi> 2.10. and the Prophet beats them company in their ſorrow, <hi>Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upen the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my People, Lament.</hi> 2.11.</p>
                  <p>If it be for ſome perſonall and grievous ſin that we have been miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried into: Holy <hi>David</hi> is a meet example for us; <hi>My bones,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>waxed old, through my roaring all the day long; for day and night thy hand was heavie upon me; my moiſture is turned into the drought of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Pſal.</hi> 32.3, 4. and elſewhere, <hi>My ſore ran in the night, and ceaſed not, my ſoul refuſed to be comforted; I complained, and my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was over-whelmed, Pſal.</hi> 77.2, 3. Where are thoſe pandars of ſin the Romiſh caſuiſts, that teach the leaſt meaſure of ſorrow, even meer attrition, is enough for a penitent. Surely, had the man after Gods own heart thought ſo, he had ſpared many a ſigh, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a ſobbe, and many a tear that his ſins coſt him; and ſo muſt they do us, if ever we hope to recover true comfort to our ſouls; and certainly could we be rightly apprehenſive of the dread Majeſty of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:97700:119"/>
the moſt high God whom we move to anger with our ſin; and could conſider the hainouſneſs of ſin whereby we provoke the eyes of his glory; and laſtly the dreadfulneſs of that eternal torment which our ſin drawes after it, we could not think it eaſy to ſpend too much ſorrow upon our ſins.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, if from our own private boſome, we ſhall caſt our eyes upon the common ſins of the times, and places wherein we live, a taſt whereof I have given you in this our preſent diſcourſe; where, oh where ſhall we finde tears enough to bewail them? now ſack-cloth and aſhes, ſighs and tears, weeping and wailing, rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of garments, yea rending of hearts too are all too little to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe our juſt mourning. When good <hi>Ezra</hi> heard but of that one ſin wherewith both Prieſts and Levites, and the Rulers and People of Iſrael were tainted, which was their intermarriage with the Heathen, ſo as the holy ſeed was vitiated with this mixture, how paſſionately was he affected! Let himſelf tell you; <hi>When I heard this thing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I rent my garment and my mantle, and pluckt off the hair of my head, and of my beard, and ſat down aſtoniſhed untill the evening ſacrifice, Ezra</hi> 9.3, 4. What would he have done think we, if he had ſeen ſo many abominations, and heard ſo many and ſoul blaſphemies of his Iſrael as we have been witneſſes of in theſe laſt times? This for the quantity.</p>
                  <p>Now ſecondly, for the quality of our mourning, we may not think to reſt in a meer ſorrow, in a penſive kind of ſullenneſſe, <hi>Worldly ſorrow cauſeth death,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.10. <hi>For by the ſorrow of the heart the Spirit is broken, Prov.</hi> 15.13. <hi>and a broken ſpirit dryeth the bones, Prov.</hi> 17.22.</p>
                  <p>And this is one main difference betwixt the Chriſtian mourner and the Pagan; both equally complain, both are ſenſible of the cauſes of their complaint; but the ſorrow of the one is ſimply and abſolutely afflictive, as looking no further but to the very object of his grief; the other is mixed with divers holy temperaments: as with a meekneſs of Spirit, with a faithul reliance upon God, yea even with ſome kind of joy it ſelf; for, <hi>when we are bidden to rejoyce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, Philip.</hi> 4.4. even the diſmal dayes of our mourning, are not excepted; <hi>Not ſo only,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>but we glory in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, Rom.</hi> 5.3. Yea more then ſo, <hi>My brethen</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>James) count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations, James</hi> 1.2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:97700:120"/>Thirdly, for the manner of our mourning: we cannot but take notice that there is a ſolemn mourning, and there is a private and domeſtical; the ſolemn is by publick indiction of authority: That only Power that can command our Perſons, may command our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation and preſcribe the circumſtances of the Performance of it: <hi>Niniveh</hi> it ſelf had ſo much divinity as to know and practiſe this truth; How ſtrict a Proclamation was that of the King of that Heathen City; <hi>Let neither man nor beaſt, herd nor flock taſt any thing, let them not feed nor drink water, but let man and beaſt be covered with ſack-cloth, &amp;c.</hi> As for the choiſe and punctuality of the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this publick mourning muſt be limited, where ſhould it reſt but in the hand of ſoveraignty; whoſe wiſdom is to be preſuppoſed ſuch as to pitch upon the meeteſt ſeaſons for this Practiſe: It is very remarkable that we finde recorded in the caſe of Iſraels Publick mourning, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.9, 10.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then Nenemiah which is the Tirſhatha,</hi> or governour, <hi>and Ezra the Prieſt, the Scribe, and the Levites, that taught the People ſaid unto all the People; This daie is holy unto the Lord your God; mourne not, nor weep; Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the ſweet, and ſend por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our Lord, neither be ye ſorrie; for the joy of the Lord is your ſtrength.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A conſideration (if I may intimate it without preſumption) meet to be tendred to our Brethren of the neighbour Church, who are wont to caſt their publick faſts upon the Lords day, contrary no leſs to the determination of the Councels of the Evangelical Churches, then the practiſe of the Jewiſh: For what other is this but Gods holy-day; of which we may well take-up the words of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>This is the Day which the Lord hath made, let us rejoice and be glad in it.</hi> As it would therefore be utterly unſeaſonable to rejoyce in a day of mourning: ſo muſt it needs be to mourn in a day of rejoycing.</p>
                  <p>The rites and formes of publick mournings may and were wont to vary according to the uſages of ſeverall Nations and Churches; how ceremonious the Jewes were in this kind I need not tell you; here was rending of garments, girding with ſackcloth, muffling of faces, proſtration on floores, covering with aſhes, houling on the houſe-tops, cutting and tearing of hair, wringing of hands, and all poſſible geſtures that might expreſſe depth of paſſion; And ſo much of this is imitable by us, as may in a grave Chriſtian faſhion
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:97700:120"/>
teſtify our dejection and true ſorrow of heart upon the occaſion of publick calamities; this ſolemn humiliation then being alwaies joyned with an afflicting the body by faſting (for deep ſorrow doth both take away appetite, and diſregards nature) ſo it calls us for the time to an abſolute forbearance, and neglective forgetfulneſs of all Earthly comforts; In which regard the Popiſh mock-faſts which allow the greateſt dainties in the ſtricteſt abſtinence; and the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh, which ſhut up in an evening gluttony, are no better then hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall counterfeits of a religious ſelf-humbling: thoſe habits then, thoſe diſcourſes or actions, thoſe contentments which are in themſelves perhaps not lawfull only, but commendable, muſt now be avoided as unſeaſonable, if not ſinful: How hainouſly did the Almighty take this miſ-timed pleaſure and jollity at the hands of his people the Jewes? <hi>In that day</hi> (ſaith <hi>Eſay) did the Lord God of Hoſts call to weeping and to mourning, and to baldneſſe, and to girding with ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth: And behold joy and gladneſſe, ſlaying Oxen, and killing Sheep, eating fleſh, and drinking wine; let us eat and drink, for to morrow we ſhall dye.</hi> And what was the iſſue? <hi>It was revealed in mine ears by the Lord of Hosts, ſurely this iniquity ſhall not be purged from you till ye dye, ſaith the Lord God of Hoſts, Eſay</hi> 22.12, 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>In matter of private mournings every man is allowed to be the arbiter of his own Time, Place, Meaſure, manner of performance: alwayes ſo, as that he keep within the juſt bounds of piety, decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, diſcreet moderation; as <hi>Bernard</hi> well adviſeth in the like kind, ſo puniſhing a Rebell, that he do not deſtroy a ſubject: Neither can I apprehend any reaſon, if we entertain a well grounded ſorrow,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.16.</note> why we may not expreſſe it: Not in an hypocritical way of oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation as the vain Phariſees taxed by our Saviour, which disfigured their countenances, and did ſet a ſowre face upon a light heart, that they might appear unto men to faſt, but in a wiſe, ſober, ſeemly, unaffected deportment: to inſtance in the caſe of the death of thoſe to whom we have the deareſt relation; there can be no caſe wherein mourning can be more ſeaſonable; it is no leſſe then a judgment that God denounceth againſt King <hi>Jehojakin, They ſhall not lament for him, ſaying, Ah my Brother, or Ah Siſter, they ſhall not lament for him, ſaying, Ah Lord, or Ah his glory, Jer.</hi> 22.18. And it was an hard word that God ſpake to <hi>Ezekiel; Son of man, behold I take away from thee the deſire of thine eyes with a ſtroak; yet ſhalt thou neither
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:97700:121"/>
mourn nor weep, neither ſhall thy tears run down, forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, &amp;c. Ezek.</hi> 24.16. Lo ſuch a wiſe as it might have been, froward, diſobedient, unquiet, it had been no greatly difficult charge to have parted with her; but it ſeems <hi>Ezekiels</hi> was a dear, pleaſing, loving conſort, even the deſire of his eyes, and the comfort of his life, and therefore to part with her without tears muſt needs be a double grief to his Soul: as therefore 'tis unnatural and inhumane not to mourn for Parents, Wives, Husbands, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Siſters, Children, Friends: ſo it cannot be unmeet to teſtify our mourning even by our outward habit; I could never ſee a reaſon why it ſhould not be fit to wear blacks upon funerall occaſions; Neither Piety nor Charity is an enemy to civill ceremonies; This colour and faſhion is not indecent, nor juſtly offenſive, ſo as the mind be free from ſuperſtition and over-nice curioſity; ſuch, as <hi>Balſac</hi> jeers at in his vain French Lady, who affected to have not her houſe onely, but all the veſſels and utenſils that belong to it put into that hew.<note place="margin">Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and. ab Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro.

                     </note> If you tell me that the Heathens mourned thus; I muſt tell you that all did not ſo; ſome Nations mourned in white, others in blew, others in purple, and if all had done ſo, they are no ill patterns in matters of meer civilities; beſides that in reaſon this colour is moſt proper for ſad occaſions, for as white comes neareſt to light, and black to darkneſs, ſo we know that light and joy, darkneſſe and ſorrow are commonly uſed to reſemble and expreſſe each other.</p>
                  <p>Well may we then outwardly profeſs our inward mourning for the dead; but yet not beyond a due moderation; It is not for us to mourn as men without hope, as the Apoſtle holily adviſeth his Theſſalonians: Our ſorrow muſt walk in a mid-way betwixt neglect and exceſs! <hi>Sarah</hi> was the firſt that we find mourn'd for in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and <hi>Abraham</hi> the firſt mourner; now the Hebrew Doctors obſerve that in <hi>Geneſis.</hi> 23.2. where <hi>Abrahams</hi> mourning is ſpecified, the letter which is in the midſt of that original word that ſignifies his weeping, is in all their Bibles written leſſe then all his fellowes; which they who find mountains in every tittle of <hi>Moſes</hi> interpret to imply the moderate mourning of that holy Patriark; ſurely, he who was the Father of the faithful did by the power of his faith miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the ſorrow for the loſs of ſo dear a partner.</p>
                  <p>Thus much for the manner of our mourning: Now for as much as it is the mourner in <hi>Sion,</hi> not in <hi>Babylon,</hi> whom we look after;
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:97700:121"/>
In the fourth place the inſeparable concomitant of his mourning, muſt be his holy devotion; whether it be in matter of ſuffering, or of ſin; in both which our ſorrow is ill-beſtowed, if it do not ſend us ſo much the more eagerly to ſeek after our God; Thus hath the mourning of all holy ſouls ever been accompanied: the greateſt mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that we can read of, was <hi>Job,</hi> who can ſay, <hi>My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burnt with heat. Job.</hi> 30.30. How doth he lift up his eyes from his dunghill to Heaven? and ſay; <hi>I have ſinned, what ſhall I do to thee, O thou Preſerver of men? Job.</hi> 6.20. The diſtreſſes of <hi>David,</hi> and the depth of his ſorrowes cannot be unknown to any man that hath but looked into the book of God; and what are his divine ditties but the zealous expreſſions of his faithfull recourſes to the throne of grace? good <hi>Ezra</hi> tells you what he did, when he heard of the generall infection of his people with their Heathen matches; <hi>Having rent my garments, and my mantle I fell upon my knees, and ſpread out my hands, unto the Lord my God; and ſaid, O my God I am aſhamed, and bluſh to lift up my face to thee, O my God, for our iniquities are increaſed over our heads, and our treſpaſs is grown up to the Heavens. Ezra.</hi> 9.5.6. And <hi>Daniel,</hi> a no leſſe devour mourner then he, layes forth himſelf in as holy a paſſion; <hi>I ſet my face unto the Lord God to ſeek him by prayer and ſupplications, with fasting, and ſackcloth, and aſhes; and I prayed unto the Lord my God, and made my confeſſion, and ſaid; O Lord, the great and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full God, keeping the covenant and mercie to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandements; we have ſinned, and have done wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, and have rebelled even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments, &amp;c.</hi> Hereupon it is that praier is ever joyned with faſting in all our humiliations; without which the emptineſſe of our mawes were but a vain and purpoſeleſs ceremony: as that which was onely taken up to whet our devotions, and to give a ſharper ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite to pious duties: So as he that mourneth and faſteth without praying, is, as he that takes the preparative but refuſes the medicine that might bring him health; or as he that toiles all day in the vineyard, and neglects to call for his wages.</p>
                  <p>This for the companion of our mourning; Fifthly, and Laſtly, The attendant of our mourning is the good uſe that muſt be made of it, for the bettering of the Soul: for ſurely, affliction never leaves us as it findes us: if we be not better for our mourning, we are the

worſe: He is an unprofitable mourner that improves not all his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to repentance and amendment of life; whether his ſin be the immediate object of his griefe or his affliction; and this is both the intention of our Heavenly Father in whipping us, and the beſt iſſue of our teares: Thus it was with his <hi>Iſrael, Their dayes</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>did he conſume in vanity, and their years in trouble; when he ſlew them, then they ſought him; and they returned, and inquired early af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God;</hi>

                  <p>To the ſame purpoſe is that of <hi>Jeremiah; In thoſe dayes, and in that time, ſaith the Lord, the children of Iſrael ſhall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping, they ſhall go and ſeek the Lord their God; they ſhall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, ſaying, Come let us joyne our ſelves to the Lord in a perpetuall covenant that ſhall not be forgotten: Jerem.</hi> 50.4.5.</p>
                  <p>Surely, as he were an unnaturall parent that would ſcourge his child with any other purpoſe then to correct and amend ſomewhat amiſs in him; ſo is he no better then an ungracious child, that makes a noiſe under the rod, but amends not his fault.</p>
                  <p>Here then let mine eyes run down with tears, night and day, and let them not ceaſe for the obſtinate unproficiency of the ſons of my mother under the heavy hand of my God, O Lord are not thine eyes upon the truth? <hi>thou haſt ſtricken them, but they have not grived; thou hast conſumed them, but they have refuſed to receive correction; they have made their faces harder then a rock, they have refuſed to return. Jerem.</hi> 5.3. how ſadly doſt thou complain of us under the perſon of thine <hi>Iſrael? In vain have I ſmitten your children, they received no correction, Jerem.</hi> 2.30. Notwithſtanding all the fair warnings that thou haſt given us. We run on reſolutely in the courſe of our wickedneſs, as if thoſe pathes were both ſafe and pleaſing, giving thee juſt cauſe to renew thine old complaint againſt the men of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem; Thus ſaith the Lord; Behold I frame evill against you, and deviſe a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe againſt you, Returne ye now every one from his evill wayes, and make your wayes, and your doings good; And they ſaid, There is no hope, but we will walk after our own deviſes, and we will every one do the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his evill heart. Jerem.</hi> 18.11.12. wo is me, who ſees not that after all the blood that thou haſt let out of our vaines, we are ſtill full of the deadly inflammations of pride, and maliciouſneſſe? that

after we have drunk ſo deep of the cup of thy fury even to the dregs, we ceaſe not to be drunk with the intemperate cups of our beaſtly exceſs? and after ſtrict profeſſions of holyneſſe have run out into horrible blaſphemies of thy ſacred name? So as we have too juſt cauſe to fear leſt thou have decreed to make good upon us that wofull word which thy Prophet denounced againſt thy once-no-leſs-dear people, <hi>I will make this Land deſolate, and an hiſſing, every one that paſſeth thereby ſhall be aſtoniſhed, and hiſſe, becauſe of all the plagues thereof.

                  <p>Hitherto then I have ſhewed you the juſt grounds of our mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; afflictions, ſins, dangers, and applyed them to our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, I have ſhewed you the due regulation of our mourning in the quantity, the quality, the manner of performing it, the company that goes with it, and the train that followes it; what remaines now but that I ſhould labour to perſwade you all to be true mourners in our <hi>Sion?</hi> were it my work to exhort you to mirth and jollity, the task were both pleaſing to undertake, and eaſie to perform; for we all naturally affect to be delighted, yea I doubt there are too many Chriſtians that with the Epicure place their chief felicity in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; but for ſorrow and mourning it is a ſowre and harſh thing, unpleaſing to the ear, but to the heart more; But, if, as Chriſtians, we come to weigh both theſe in the ballance of the ſanctuary, we ſhall find cauſe to take up other reſolutions; will ye hear what wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes of the point? <hi>Sorrow,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is better then laughter; And it is better to go to the houſe of mourning, then to the houſe of feaſting.</hi>

                        <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.2, 3.</note> Lo, his very authority alone were enough, who, as a great King, had all the World to be his Minſtrell; but withall, he ſticks not to give us his reaſon, why then is ſorrow better then laughter? [<hi>For, by the ſadneſs of the countenance the heart is made better</hi>] look to the effects of both, and you ſhall eaſily ſee the difference: ſorrow calls our hearts home to God, and our ſelves, which are apt to run wild in mirth; where did you ever ſee a man made more holy with world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſure? no, that is apt to debauch him rather; but many a ſoul hath been bettered with ſorrow; for that begins his mortification, recollecting his thoughts to a ſerious conſideration of his ſpirituall condition, and working his heart to a due remorſe for his ſin, and a lowly ſubmiſſion to the hand that inflicts it.</p>
                  <p>And why ſhould it be better to go to the houſe of mourning then

to the houſe of feaſting? [<hi>For this is the end of all men, and the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall lay it to his heart</hi>] The houſe of mourning hath here princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally reſpect to a funerall; the death which is lamented for, being the end of all fleſh, a man is here, and thus, put feelingly in mind of his mortality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which in an houſe of feaſting and jollity is utterly forgotten: By how much then it is better for a man to have his heart kept in order by the meditation of death, then to run wild after worldly vanity; by ſo much is the houſe of mourning better then the houſe of feaſting.</p>

                  <p>Is it not partly for that neceſſary viciſſitude which thou in thine infinite wiſdome haſt ſet of joy and mourning? ſo as no man can be alwaies capable of both theſe; but he that rejoyceth muſt have his turne of mourning (as <hi>Abraham</hi> told the rich glutton in his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and he that mourneth muſt have a time of rejoycing; Or is it for the great difference that there is of the ſeverall kindes of mourning and joy? for as there is a naturall joy and ſorrow which is neither good nor evill but in it ſelf indifferent, ſo there is a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſorrow and joy which is evill, and a ſpirituall joy and ſorrow which is good; there is a temporall ſorrow and joy enterchanged here, and there is an eternall joy or ſorrow reſerved for hereafter: So then hath thine infinite juſtice and wiſdom diſtributed thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and puniſhments, that the carnall and ſinfull joy is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced with eternal ſorrow and mourning; the holy and ſpirituall

There were ancient and eager quarrels betwixt the Eaſtern and Weſtern Churches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the day whereon it ſhould be kept; but whether it ſhould be kept or no, there was never yet any queſtion ſince Chriſtianity look't forth into the World: and as that Paſche, ſo this <hi>Eaſter</hi> is juſtly the feaſt, for the eminency of it above the reſt; for if we do with joy and thankfulneſſe according to the Angels meſſage ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize the day wherein the Son of God, our bleſſed Redeemer being born, entred the life of humane nature: how much more ſhould we celebrate that day, wherein having conquered all the powers of death and Hell he was, as it were, born again to the life of a glorious immortality? But to leave the time, and come to the Text. This

(for) that leads it in, is both a relative, and an illative; refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to what he had ſaid in the foregoing words; and inferring a neceſſary conſequence of the one clauſe upon the other; <hi>Purge out the old leaven; for Chriſt our paſſover is ſacrificed for us</hi>; The whole Text is Allegoricall; alluding to the charge and duty of Gods anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent people, the <hi>Jewes,</hi> in the obſervation of their paſſover; who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no leſſe pain then cutting off from the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> muſt admit of no leavened bread to be eaten or found in their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes during the whole ſeven dayes of this celebrity, as you may ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.17.18, &amp;c. As therefore the ceremoniall paſſover would admit of no materiall leaven: So the ſpirituall paſſover may not abide any leaven of wickedneſſe, <hi>Purge therefore out the old leaven; For Chriſt our paſſover is ſacrificed for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt work then that we have to do, is, to caſt back our eyes to the ground of this inſtitution, and to enquire why no leaven might conſiſt with the Jewiſh paſſover; And we ſhall find that there was not the ſame reaſon of the firſt obſervation of this ceremony, and of the following: The firſt was Neceſſity; Devotion was the ground of the reſt. Neceſſity firſt; for in that ſuddain departure which they were put upon, there could be no leaſure to leaven their dough, as you may ſee, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.39.</p>
                  <p>Devotion afterward in a gratefull recognition both of their own ſervile condition; and of the gracious providence of God: In the former they were called to look back upon their old Egyptian ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude by their unleavned bread; for this was (<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>) the bread of affliction as we turn it, or the bread of the poor, as the word ſignifies, which they muſt now eat to put them in mind of their hard and poor condition in Egypt under their evill task maſters all their lives after, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.3. to the ſame purpoſe it was that they muſt eat the Lamb, not with ſowre herbes as it had wont to be turned; (for a ſharp kind of ſowreneſſe in ſawces is eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pleaſing and taſtfull) but with bitter herbes, yea, as the word is in the Originall (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) <hi>cum amaritudinibus</hi>) with bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>
                  <p>In the latter they were minded of a double providence of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty: One, that God was pleaſed to fetch them out of Egypt in an happy ſuddainneſſe; even when they had no leaſure to make up their bach; The other that he ſuſtained them with this unleavened
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:97700:125"/>
dough till he ſent them Manna in the Wilderneſſe. The one was the bread of the poor, the other the bread of Angels. As therefore he would have a pot of Manna kept in the Ark for a Monument of that miraculous food wherewith he fed them in the deſert; ſo he thought good to ordain this obſervation of unleavened bread for a perpetuall memoriall of their proviſion preceding it.</p>
                  <p>And this was not onely a charge but a ſanction, under the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere penalty whether of excommunication, or death, or both: both for the authority of the Commander, and for the weight of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; whereby God meant both to rub up their memory of a temporall benefit paſt: and to quicken their faith in a greater ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall favour of their future Redemption from ſin and death by the blood of that true paſchall lamb which ſhould be ſacrificed for them.</p>
                  <p>This is the ground of this inſtitution. Now let us if you pleaſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a little into the ground of this al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>) were more then a buſhel of our meaſure, and one morſel of leaven ſeaſons it all. In evill, ſo here immediately before my Text in an ordinary Jewiſh proverb A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump: Secondly it hath in it ſelf a diſpleaſing ſowerneſs, in which regard it is an ill conſtruction attributed both to falſe doctrine, and to evill manners. To falſe doctrine:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.6.</note> 
                     <hi>Take heed</hi> ſaith our Saviour <hi>of the leaven of the Phariſes</hi>; To ill manners; ſo in the next words ye have the leaven of malice and wickedneſs.</p>
                  <p>So then here the very inference offers us theſe two neceſſary heads of our diſcourſe; 1. That ſin, or the ſinner (for it may be taken of either or both) is ſpirituall leaven. 2. That this leaven muſt be purged out becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>our paſſover,</hi> and <hi>ſacrificed for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the firſt: ſin hath the true qualities of leaven; both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the offenſive ſowreneſs, and of the diffuſion. In the former nothing can be ſo diſtaſtfull unto God, as ſin; Indeed nothing can diſpleaſe but it; as nothing is ſo ſweet and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:97700:126"/>
pleaſing to him as the obedience of his faithfull ones. If any edible thing could be more offenſive to the palate; Sin would be likened to it; As indeed it is ſtill reſembled by whatſoever may be moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring to all the ſenſes: To the ſight; ſo it is compared to filth, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.3. to beaſtly excrements; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. to ſpots and blemiſhes, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. to menſtruous and polluted blood, <hi>Ezec.</hi> 16.6. To the ſmell; ſo to a corrupted ointment; to the ſtench of a dead carcaſs; what ſhould I inſtance in the reſt? How ſhould it be other then highly offenſive to the Majeſty of God, when it is profeſſedly oppoſite to divine juſtice? ſince all ſin is the tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the royall law; even the conſcience which is Gods taſter finds it abominably loathſome; how much more that God who is greater then the conſcience; who ſo abhors it that (as we are wont to do to the potſherd which hath held poyſonous liquor) he throwes away and breaks the very veſſel wherein it was: as he that findes an hair or a coal in the daintieſt bit, ſpits it out all. Did God find ſin in his Angels? he tumbles them down out of Heaven; Doth he find ſin in our firſt parents? he hurles them out of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe; Yea, did he find our ſins laid upon the bleſſed Son of his love; of his nature? he ſpares him not awhit, but laies load upon him till he roars out in the anguiſh of his Soul. Lo, he was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities, the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our peace were upon him, and by his ſtripes we are healed, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 53.5.</p>
                  <p>And to whom ſhould we rather conform our ſelves then to the moſt holy God? what diet ſhould we affect but his who is the rule of all perfection? How then ſhould we utterly abhorr every evill way, how ſhould we hate our ſins with a perfect hatred? And ſurely, the more ill ſavour and loathlineſſe we can find in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom ſins, the nearer we come to the purity of that holy one of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> our bleſſed Redeemer whoſe ſtile it is, <hi>Thou lovest righteouſneſs, and hateſt wickedneſs. Pſ.</hi> 45.7. Oh then be we perfect as our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Heaven is perfect; Cleanſe your hands ye ſinners and purge your hearts ye double minded.</p>
                  <p>What ſhall we ſay then to the diſpoſition of thoſe men, that can find no ſavour in any thing but their ſins? No morſell goes down ſweetly, merrily, with them but this: wo is me, how do they chear themſelves with the hope of injoying their ſinfull pleaſures? how
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:97700:126"/>
do they recreate themſelves with the memory of their fore-paſſed filthineſs? how do they glory in that licentious liberty which they indulge unto themſelves? how do they even when they are grown old and paſt beaſtly action, tickle themſelves with the wanton re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances of their younger beſtialities? yea ſo hath the delight in ſin moſt wofully beſotted them, that they reſpect not friends, eſtate, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, health, body, ſoul, in compariſon of the bewitching con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment they find in their ſins; Oh poor miſerable ſouls! Oh the wretchedeſt of all creatures, not men but beaſts! let me not ſeem either unmannerly, or uncharitable, to ſpeak from the mouth of Gods Spirit: you know the word <hi>Canis ad vomitum</hi>; The dog to his vomit; The ſwine to it's mire: And if they will needs be dogs; how can they look for any other but dogs intertainment? <hi>Foris Canes</hi> without ſhall be dogs, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.15. But for us dear Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans let me take up that obteſtation of the Pſalmiſt. <hi>Oh all ye that love the Lord, hate the thing which is ſin, Pſal.</hi> 97.10. let us hate even the garment ſpotted with the fleſh, yea let us hate our ſelves that we can hate our ſins no more: And if at any time through the frailty of our wretched nature, and the violence of tentation we be drawn into a ſinfull action, yet let us take heed of being leavened with wickedneſs, <hi>Purge out the old leaven; for Chriſt our paſſover is ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, as ſin is leaven in reſpect of the ſowring quality of it, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in reſpect of the diffuſive: It began with one Angel and infected Legions; It began with one Woman, it infected all the Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mankind; let it take hold of one faculty, it infecteth the whole ſoul and body; let it ſeize upon one perſon in a family it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts the whole houſe; from thence it ſpreads over the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; and taints whole Towns, Cities, Regions: as it is with certain contagious diſeaſes that have not been bounded with mountaines or Seas: It is very pregnant which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> whoſe word (ſaith he) <hi>will eat as doth a canker or a gangrene,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.17. ye ſee how a gangrene even from the leaſt toe ſoon ſtrikes the heart; and the canker from a ſcarce ſenſible begining conſumes the gummes, eats through the cheek, eats down the noſe and will admit of no limits but deformity and death: thus it is with ſin whether intellectuall or morall: Arianiſme began in a family, ſpread over the World. And Antinomianiſme began in one Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:97700:127"/>
of this dioceſſe and how much it is ſpread, I had rather lament, then ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>I doubt not but many of you who hear me this day have had la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable proofs of this truth: let there be but a drunkard, or a ſwearer in a family how ſoon hath this ſcabbed ſheep tainted the whole flock; Grace and Godlineſs is not ſo eaſily propagated: ſin hath the advantage of the proclivity of our wicked nature. It hath the wind and tyde both with it, goodneſs hath both againſt it: health doth not uſe to be taken from others, but ſickneſs doth.</p>
                  <p>Since your wickedneſſe is of ſo ſpreading a nature, how carefull ſhould we be to prevent, and reſiſt the very firſt beginnings of ſin; It is a 1000. times more eaſy to keep the flood-gates ſhut, then to drain the lower grounds when they are once over-flown.</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. How ſhy and weary ſhould we be of joyning ſocieties with the infectious, whether in opinion, or in manners: <hi>A man that is an heretick reject,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, Tit.</hi> 3.10. <hi>If any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetuous, or a railer, or an idolater, or a drunkard, with ſuch a one eat not,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. withdraw your ſelves from the tents of theſe men, &amp;c. into their ſecret, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3ly. How much doth it concern all publick perſons whether ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical or civil to improve their authority to the utmoſt for the timely preventing of the ſpreading of vice: and for the ſevere cenſure and expurgation of thoſe whom the Pſalmiſt (as the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal word ſignifies) calls leavened perſons, Pſ. 71.4. The palpable neglect whereof hath been a ſhamefull eyeſore to the conſcientious beholders, a ſoul blemiſh to the Goſpel; and a juſt ſcandal upon the Church. And though another mans ſin cannot infect me unleſſe I do partake with him in it: yet a true <hi>Lot</hi> will vex his righteous ſoul with the unclean converſation of the <hi>Sodomites</hi>; and even others ſins may help to draw down judgments upon the community wherein they live: good reaſon that all care ſhould be taken for purging out the old leaven, that ſo the old leaven being purged out the whole lump may be holy.</p>
                  <p>So much of the firſt point, that ſin is leaven; the ſecond followes that this leaven muſt be purged out if we would have any intereſt in <hi>Chriſt our paſſover which is ſacrificed for us</hi>: The inference you ſee doth neceſſarily imply ſo much In vain ſhould any Jew talk of keeping a paſſover to God, if he would eat the Lambe with Leavened
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:97700:127"/>
bread; in vain ſhould any Chriſtian talk of applying Chriſt to his ſoul, whiles his heart willingly retains the leaven of any known ſin.</p>
                  <p>Certainly this is a common, and a dangerous cozenage whereby millions of ſouls cheat themſelves into hell; they fondly think they may hold fair quarter with Chriſt, and yet give ſecret intertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their ſins, <hi>Demas</hi> thinks he may embrace the preſent world and yet need not leave his hold of Chriſt; <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> will cloſely harbour an hypocriticall ſacriledg, and yet will be as good profeſſors as the beſt. <hi>A Simon Magus</hi> will be baptized Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, yet a ſorcerer ſtill: and many a one ſtill thinks he may drink, and ſwear, and debauch, and profane Gods ordinances; and rob Gods houſe, and reſiſt lawfull authority, and lie and plunder, or ſlander his neighbour, and yet hold good termes with a forward profeſſion. Yea there are thoſe that will be countenancing their ſins with their chriſtianity, as if they were priviledged to ſin becauſe they are in Chriſt: Then which there can not be a more injurious and blaſphemous fancy. Certainly their ſins are ſo much more abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to God and men by how much more intereſt they challenge in a Chriſtian profeſſion: yea if but a bare intertainment of a known ſin; it is enough to bar them out from any plea in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Vain fools, now groſly do theſe men delude their own ſouls whiles they imagine they can pleaſe God with a leavened paſſover; this is the way to make them and their ſacrifices abominable to the Almighty: It is to them that God ſpeaks as in thunder and fire, <hi>What doeſt thou taking my covenant into thy mouth, ſeeing thou hateſt to be reformed, and haſt caſt my words behinde thee, Pſal.</hi> 50.16, 17. To them it is that he ſpeaks by his Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> 66.3. <hi>He that killeth an ox as if he ſlew a man, he that ſacrificeth a Lambe as if he cut off a dogs-neck:</hi> Shortly then my brethren, ſince we are now addreſſing our ſelves to this Evangelical paſſover; if ever we think to partake of this Heavenly feaſt with true comfort to our ſouls; Let us ſee that we have clearly abandoned all the ſowre leaven of our ſins: let us come with clear, and untainted ſouls to this bleſſed feaſt; and ſay and do with holy <hi>David, I will waſh my hands in innocency, O Lord, and ſo will I go to thine altar, Pſ.</hi> 26.6.</p>
                  <p>Thus long we have neceſſarily dwelt upon the inference, and contexture of this ſcripture, we now come to ſcan this divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:97700:128"/>
as it ſtands alone in it ſelf; wherein our meditation hath four heads to paſſe thorough: 1. That Chriſt is a paſſover: 2. Our Paſſover. 3. Our Paſſover ſacrificed. 4. ſacrificed for us.</p>
                  <p>To begin with the firſt. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which we find, is derived not from the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which ſignifies to ſuffer, as ſome of the Latine fathers out of their ignorance of Language have conceived, but from the Hebrew (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) which ſignifies a tranſition, well turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our language into Paſſe-over: For here was a double paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be celebrated; 1. The Angel's paſſing over the houſes of the Iſraelites, when he ſmote all the firſt born of Egypt; and 2ly. Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels paſſing out of Egypt. The word admits of many ſenſes: ſometimes it is taken for the time of this ſolemnity, <hi>Act.</hi> 12.4. ſometimes for the ſacrifices offered in this ſolemnity, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.4. ſometimes for the repreſentation of the act of Gods tranſition, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.11. Sometimes for the Lamb that was then to be offered and eaten, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.11. They killed the paſſover, and the Prieſts ſprinkled the blood from their hands: Thus is it taken in this place when it is ſaid Chriſt our paſſover is ſacrificed for us. So as here is a trope or figure twice told; Firſt, the lamb is the paſſover, Secondly, Chriſt is that paſchal Lamb.</p>
                  <p>You would think this now far-fetched, here was a double paſſing over. The Angels paſſing over the Iſraelites, the Iſraelites paſſing out of <hi>Egypt</hi>; both were acts, the one of God, the other of men; as for the lamb it is an animal ſubſtance; Yet this Lamb repreſents this paſſover. This is no newes in ſacramental ſpeeches: The thing ſigned is uſually put for the ſign it ſelf: <hi>My covenant ſhall be in your fleſh</hi>; that is, circumciſion, the ſign of my covenant, the rock that followed them was Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. that is Chriſt was repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by that rock, <hi>This cup is the new teſtament,</hi> So here Chriſt our paſſover:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.13.</note> that is Chriſt repreſented by the Paſchal-lamb. What an infatuation is upon the Romiſh party, that rather then they will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of any other then a groſſe literall capernaiticall ſence in the words of our Saviours ſacramental ſupper, <hi>This is my body,</hi> will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Heaven and Earth together; and either by a too forceable conſequence endeavour to overthrow the truth of Chriſts humanity, or turne him into a monſter, a wafer, a crum, a nothing. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath told us plainly, <hi>ſacramentaliter intellectum vivifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit</hi>: Take it in a ſacramental ſence there is infinite comfort, and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:97700:128"/>
ſpiritual life in it. As for his body St. <hi>Peter</hi> hath told us the <hi>heavens muſt contain him till the time of the reſtitution of all things, Acts</hi> 3.21. Yea when our Saviour himſelf hath told us, <hi>the words that I ſpeak are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and life. Jo.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>Now what a marvellous mercy was this of God to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> thus to paſſe over them when he ſlew the firſt-borne of <hi>Egypt?</hi> There was not an houſe in all <hi>Egypt</hi> wherein there was not mourning and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation; no roof but coverd a ſuddainly made carcaſſe: what an unlook't for conſternation was here in every <hi>Egyptian</hi> Family? Only the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that dwelt amongſt them were free to applaud this judgment that was inflicted upon their tyrannous perſecutors, and for their very cauſe, inflicted: for this mercy are they beholden under God, to the blood of their Paſchal-lamb ſprinkled upon their door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts: Surely had they eaten the lamb, and not ſprinkled the blood, they had not eſcaped the ſtroak of the deſtroying Angel; This was in figure; In reality it is ſo, It is by, and from the blood of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer ſprinkled upon our ſouls that we are freed from the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Almighty. Had not he dyed for us, were not the benefit of his precious blood applyed to us; we ſhould lye open to all the fearful judgments of God, and as to the upſhot of all, eternall death of body and ſoul: As then the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were never to eat the Paſchal-lamb but they were recalled to the memory of that ſaving preterition of the Angel, and Gods merciful deliverance from the fiery furnaces of the Egyptians; ſo neither may we ever behold this ſacramental repreſentation of the death of our bleſſed Saviour, but we ſhould bethink our ſelves of the infinite mercy of our good God in ſaving us from everlaſting death and reſcuing us from the power of hell.</p>
                  <p>This is the firſt figure; That the Lamb is the Paſſover. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecond followes, That Chriſt is that Paſchal-Lamb. Chriſt then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the end of the Law, it is no marvell if all the ceremonies of the Law ſerved to prefigure, and ſet him forth to Gods people; but none did ſo clearly and fully reſemble him as this of the paſchal Lambe: whether we regard, 1. the choyce, 2. the preparation, 3. the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</p>
                  <p>The choice whether in reſpect of the nature, or the quality of it: the nature, ye know this creature is noted for innocent, meek, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, profitable: ſuch was Chriſt our Saviour. His fore-runner point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:97700:129"/>
at him under this ſtile; <hi>Behold the Lamb of God,</hi> what perfect innocence was here? No guile found in his mouth: Hell it ſelf could finde nothing ro quarrel at in ſo abſolute integrity: What admirable meekneſs? <hi>He is brought as a Lamb to the ſlaughter; and as a ſheep before her ſhearers is dumb, ſo opened be not his mouth, Eſay</hi> 53.7. Doth his own treacherous ſervant betray him to the death? <hi>Friend, wherefore art thou come? Mat.</hi> 26.50. Do the cruel tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors tenter out his pretious limmes and nail his hands and feet to the tree of ſhame and curſe; <hi>Father forgive them for they know not what they do</hi>: Oh patience and meekneſſe incident into none but an infinite ſufferer!</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. The quality, Every Lamb would not ſerve the turne: it muſt be <hi>agnus immaculatus,</hi> A lamb without blemiſh that muſt be paſchal: <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.5. Neither doth it hinder ought that leave is there given to a promiſcuous uſe either of lamb or kid for the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental ſupper of the paſſover; For that was only allowed in a caſe of neceſſity, as <hi>Theodoret</hi> rightly; and as learned <hi>Junius</hi> well, in the confuſion of that firſt inſtitution; wherein certainly a lamb could not be gotten on the ſuddain by every Iſraelitiſh houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper to ſerve ſix hundred thouſand men; and ſo many there were, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.37.</p>
                  <p>This liberty then was only for the firſt turne as divers other of thoſe ceremonious circumſtances of the paſſover were, namely the four daies preparation, the ſprinkling of the blood upon the door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheeks, eating with girded loines, and ſtaves in their hands, which were not afterward required or practiſed.</p>
                  <p>The lamb then muſt repreſent, a moſt holy and perfectly ſin-leſs Saviour; could he have been capable of the leaſt ſin even in thought he had been ſo far from ranſoming the World, that he could not have ſaved himſelf; Now his exquiſite holineſſe is ſuch as that by the perfection of his merits he can and doth <hi>preſent his whole Church to himſelf glorious, not having ſpot or wrinkle or any ſuch thing; as holy and without blemiſh, Epheſ.</hi> 5.27. Canſt thou therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe thy ſelf for a ſinful wretch, a ſoul blemiſhed with many foul imperfections. Look up man, lo, thou haſt a Saviour that hath holineſſe enough for himſelf, and thee, and all the World of beleevers: cloſe with him, and thou art holy and happy; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the immaculate lamb of God that takes away the ſins of the world,</hi> thine
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:97700:129"/>
Therefore if thou canſt lay hold on him by a lively faith, and make him thine.</p>
                  <p>This for the choice; the preparation followes: ſo Chriſt is the paſchal lamb in a threefold reſpect: in reſemblance of his killing, ſprinkling his blood, and roaſting.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This Lamb, to make a true paſſover, muſt be ſlain; So was there a neceſſity that our Jeſus ſhould dye for us: The two Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in their walk to <hi>Emaus</hi> hear this not without a round reproof from the mouth of their riſen Saviour; <hi>Oh fooles and ſlow of heart to beleeve all that the Prophets have ſpoken: Ought not Chriſt to have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe things and to enter into his glory? Luc.</hi> 24.26. Ought not? there is neceſſity, the doom was in paradiſe upon mans diſobedience (<hi>morte morieris</hi>) thou ſhalt dye the death. Man ſinned, man muſt die, The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, and we in him; the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> muſt by death expiate the ſin: Had not Chriſt dyed, mankind muſt; had not he dyed the firſt death, we had all dyed both the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; <hi>without ſhedding of blood there is no remiſſion, Heb.</hi> 9.22. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by therefore are we freed from the ſence of the ſecond death, and the ſting of the firſt to the unfailing comfort of our ſoules; hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is that our Saviour is ſo carefull to have his death and paſſion ſo fully repreſented to us in both his ſacraments: the water is his blood in the firſt Sacrament; the Wine is his blood, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
                  <p>In this he is ſenſiby crucify'd before our eyes; the bread, that is his body broken, the wine his blood poured out. And if theſe acts and objects do not carry our hearts to a lively apprehenſion of Chriſt our true paſſover, we ſhall offer to him no other then the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of fools.</p>
                  <p>Lo here then a ſoveraign antidote againſt the firſt death, and a preſervative againſt the ſecond, the Lamb ſlain from the beginning of the World: why ſhould we be diſcomforted with the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that death which Chriſt hath ſuffered; why ſhould we be diſmayed with the fear of that death which our all-ſufficient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer hath fully expiated?</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. In the firſt inſtitution of this paſſover; The blood of the lamb was to be ſprinkled upon the poſts and lintells of the doores of every Iſraelite: ſo if ever we look for any benefit from Chriſt our Paſſover, there muſt be a particular application of his blood to the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:97700:130"/>
believing ſoul; even very Papiſts can ſay that unleſs our merits or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly actions be dyed or tinctured in the blood of Chriſt, they can avail us nothing: but this conſideration will meet with us more ſeaſonably up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fourth head.</p>
                  <p n="3">3ly. This paſſover muſt be roaſted home, not ſtewed, not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boild; So did the true paſchall lamb undergo the flames of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wrath for our ſins; here was not a ſcorching and bliſtering but a vehement and full torrefaction; It was an ardent heat that could fetch drops of blood from him in the garden; but it was the hotteſt of flames that he felt upon the croſs, when he cryed out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Oh who can without horrour and amazement hear ſo woſull a word fall from the mouth of the Son of God? Had he not ſaid, My Father, this ſtrain had ſunk us into utter deſpair: but now in this very torment is comfort? He knew he could not be forſaken of him of whom he ſaith; I and my Father are one: he could not be forſaken by a ſublation of union, though he ſeemed ſo by a ſubſtraction of viſion (as <hi>Leo</hi> well) the ſenſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort was clouded for a while from his humanity, his deity was ever glorious, his faith firme; and ſupplyed that ſtrong conſolation which his preſent ſenſe failed of; and therefore you ſoon hear him in a full concurrence of all Heavenly and victorious powers of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident Saviour ſay, <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my Spirit</hi>; In the mean while even in the height of this ſuffering there is our eaſe, for certainly the more the Son of God indured for us, the more ſure we are of an happy acquittance from the Tribunall of Heaven, the juſtice of God never puniſhed the ſame ſin twiſe over: By his ſtripes we are healed; by his payment we are diſcharged, by his torments we are aſſured of peace and glory.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the preparation; The eating of it followes in the appendances, the manner, the perſons.</p>
                  <p>The appendances. It muſt be eaten with unleavned bread, and with ſour, or bitter herbs: Of the unleavened bread we have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken enough before: For the herbs, that nothing might be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the ſame God that appointed meat, appointed the ſauce too, and that was a ſallad of, not pleaſing, but, bitter herbs; herein providing not ſo much for the palate of the body, as of the ſoul; to teach us that we may not hope to partake of Chriſt without ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible diſreliſhes of nature, without outward afflictions, without a true contrition of Spirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:97700:130"/>It is the condition that our Saviour makes with us in admitting us to the profeſſion of Chriſtianity; he ſhall receive an 100. fold with perſecutions; thoſe to boot; that for his ſake and the Goſpells, forſake all, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.30. Sit down therefore, O man, and count what it will coſt thee to be a true Chriſtian, <hi>through many tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Neither can we receive this evangelicall paſſover without a true contrition of ſoul for our ſins paſt; think not, my beloved, that there is nothing but jollity to be look't for at Gods table. Ye may frolick it, ye that feaſt with the World; but if ye will ſit with Chriſt and feed on him; ye muſt eat him with bitter herbs; here muſt be a ſound compunction of heart (after a due ſelf examination) for all our ſins wherewith we have offended our good God: Thou wouldſt be eating the paſchal lamb, but with ſugar-ſops, or ſome pleaſing ſauce; it may not be ſo, here muſt be a bitterneſſe of ſoul, or no paſſover: It is true that there is a kind of holy mixture of affections in all our holy ſervices; a <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Rejoyce in him with trembling,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt. It is and ſhould be our joy, that we have this lamb of God to be ours: but it is our juſt ſorrow to finde our own wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unworthineſs of ſo great a mercy. Godly ſorrow muſt make way for ſolid joy and comfort: if there be any of you therefore that harbours in your breaſt a ſecret love of, and complacency in your known and reſolved ſins (<hi>procul, O procul,</hi>) let him keep off from this holy Table; let him bewail his ſinfull miſ-diſpoſition and not dare to put forth his hand to this paſſover till he have gathered the bitter herbs of a ſorrowful remorſe for his hated offences; And where ſhould he gather theſe but in the low grounds of the Law? there they grow plenteouſly; lay the law then home to thy ſoul, that ſhall ſhow thee thy ſins, and thy judgment School thee.</p>
                  <p>Yea, dear Chriſtians, how can any of us ſee the body of our bleſſed Saviour broken, and his blood poured out; and withall think and know that his own ſins are guilty of this tort offered to the ſon of God the Lord of life, and not feel his heart touched with a ſad and paſſionate apprehenſion of his own vileneſſe, and an indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at his own wickedneſſe that hath deſerved and done this? theſe are the bitter herbs wherewith if we ſhall eat this paſſover we ſhall finde it moſt wholeſome, and nouriſhable unto us to eternall life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:97700:131"/>The manner of the eating of it followes, in three particulars.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The whole lamb muſt be eaten, not a part of it.</item>
                     <item>2. Not a bone of it muſt be broken.</item>
                     <item>3. In one houſe at once, nothing to be reſerved, or carried out.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>For the firſt; you finde it not ſo in any other cookery or proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this kind: many a Lamb did the Jewes eat in all the year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, theſe were halved and quartered as occaſion ſerved: but for the paſchal Lamb it muſt be ſet on all whole; the very entrayles muſt be waſhed and put into the roaſt, and brought to the board in an entire diſh: whoſoever would partake of Chriſt aright, muſt take whole Chriſt, not think to go away with a limme, and leave the reſt; that he ſhould <hi>dividere mendacio Chriſtum,</hi> as that Father ſpeaks: as in Gods demands of us he will have all or none; ſo in his grant to us, he will give all or none; He would not have ſo much as his coat divided, much leſſe will he abide himſelf ſhall; There have been hereticks, and I would there were not ſo ſtill; that will be ſharing, and quartering of Chriſt, one will allow of his humanity, not his eternal deity; another will allow his humane body, but not his ſoul; that muſt be ſupplyed by the deity; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will allow a divine ſoul with a fantaſtick body; One will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt to be a Prophet or a Prieſt, but will not admit of him as a King: In vain do all theſe wretched miſ-belevers pretend to partake of Chriſt the paſſover, whiles they do thus ſet him on by peecemeal: They are their own monſtrous fancies which they do thus ſet before themſelves, not the true paſchal Lamb, whom we do moſt ſacrilegiouſly violate inſtead of receiving, if our faith do not repreſent him to us wholy God and Man, ſoul and body, King, Prieſt, and Prophet, here he is ſo exhibited to us, and if we do thus beleeve in him and thus apply him to our ſouls, we do truly receive him, and with him eternal ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>Two particulars follow yet more in the manner; then the perſons allowed to this banquet, no uncircumciſed might eat thereof: Then in the next place we ſhould deſcend to the ſecond head of our diſcourſe that Chriſt is our Paſſover. Then that he is our Paſſover ſacrificed; and ſacrificed for us.</p>
                  <p>Ye ſee what a World of matter yet remains and offers it ſelf as in a thronge to our meditations; but the long buſineſs
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:97700:131"/>
of the enſuing Sacrament forbids our further diſcourſe, and calls us from ſpeaking of Chriſt our Paſſover to partaking of him; For which he prepare our ſoules that hath dearly bought them, and hath given himſelf to be our true paſſover; To whom with the Father and the bleſſed Spirit one infinite and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible God be all Praiſe, Honour, and Glory, now and for ever.</p>

                        <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41.</note> when at one Sermon he drew up no leſs then three thouſand Souls; every exhortation that he made was an Angle, or a caſting net to take ſome hearers; but theſe two ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Epiſtles are as ſome ſcene, or large drag-net to encloſe whole Shoales of believers; and this Text, which I have read unto you, is as a rowe of meſhes knit together, and depending upon each other: Firſt, you have here that our life is a ſojourning on Earth, Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this ſojourning hath a time; Thirdly, this time muſt be paſſed; Fourthly, this paſſage muſt be in fear; Fifthly, this fear muſt be of a Father: Sixthly, he is ſo a Father that he is our Judge; Laſtly, his judgment is unpartiall for he judgeth without reſpect of perſons, according to every mans work; all which may well be reduced to theſe two heads; A charge and an enforcement; a duty and a motive to perform it; The charge, or duty is, To paſs the time of their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing in fear, the motive, or enforcement, If we call on the Father, &amp;c. The duty though laſt in place, yet is firſt in nature, and ſhall be accordingly meditated of.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore our life is but a ſojourning here; our former tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation turnes it a dwelling, not ſo properly; the word is <gap reason="foreign">

But this <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> here doth both imply an home, and oppoſes it. The condition of every living ſoul, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of every Chriſtian, is, to be <hi>peregrinus,</hi> as out of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and <hi>Hoſpes,</hi> as in anothers. Think not this was the caſe of St. <hi>Peter</hi> onely, who by the exigence of his Apoſtleſhip was to travell up and down the World; for both it is apparent that <hi>Peter</hi> (after the ſhifts of our Jeſuiticall interpreters) had an houſe of his own to reſide in, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.14. and that he writes this to his Country-men the Jewes; amongſt whom (notwithſtanding their diſperſion,) there were doubtleſs many rich owners; as there are ſtill in many parts of the World after all their diſgracefull eliminations: the Father of the faithfull was ſo; Hebr. 11.13. and the Sons of that Father were ſo after him; <hi>Jacob</hi> ſpeaks of the dayes of his Pilgrimage; <hi>David</hi> was a great King; yet he confeſſes himſelf a ſtranger upon Earth, and

that this was hereditary to him; for he adds, <hi>as were my Fathers</hi>; He had more Land then they; They had ſome few fields in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> he ruled from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beerſheba,</hi> yet a profeſſed ſtranger; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as he was a type of Chriſt ſo an example of all Chriſtians; <hi>as strangers and pilgrims</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>abſtain from fleſhly luſts</hi>; The faithfull man is, according to that of <hi>Bernard,</hi> the Lords ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; his neighbours fellow, and the Worlds Maſter; <hi>All things are yours,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, yet is he the while but a ſojourner up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own inheritance; no worldly reſpects can free-deniſon a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian here; and of <hi>peregrinus</hi> make him <hi>civis.</hi>

                  <p>No it is out of the power of all earthly commodities to natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize him; for neither can his abiding be here, if he ſhould love the earth never ſo well, neither ſhall he finde any true reſt, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment here below; if any wealthy citizen upon the uncertainty of trade, ſhall have turned his ſhop-book, and his bagges into lands and mannours, and having purchaſed plentifully, and called his land by his name, ſhall be ſo fooliſh as to ſet down his reſt here and ſay, <hi>Hic requies mea</hi>; ſoul take thy eaſe, he may well look that God will give him his own; with a <hi>Thou fool, this night,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>It is true; the worldly man is at home in reſpect of his affections; but he is, and ſhall be a meer ſojourner in reſpect of his tranſitorineſs. His ſoul is faſtened to the earth; all his ſubſtance cannot faſten him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to it: Both the Indies could not purchaſe his abiding here; this is our condition as men, but much more as Chriſtians, we are perfect ſtrangers and ſojourners here in the world; and if we be no other then ſuch, why do we not demean our ſelves accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly?</p>

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:97700:133"/>
thee? Thus doth the Chriſtian here; he muſt uſe the World as if he uſed it not; he muſt paſs through the affairs of this life, without being intangled in them, as remembring who and where he is; that he is but a ſojourner here.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, here muſt be a light addreſs; no Man that goes to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ in a ſtrange Country will carry his lumber along with him; but leaves all his houſhold ſtuffe at home; no, he will not ſo much as carry his ſtock of mony or Jewells with him: as knowing he may meet with dangers of theeves, and robbers in the way, but makes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his mony by exchange to receive it where he is going, ye rich men cannot think to carry your pelfe with you into Heaven; no, it were well if you could get in your ſelves, without that cumbrous Load, it may keep you out, ye cannot carry it in: if you will go ſafe and ſure wayes, make over your ſtock by exchange that is, (as our Saviour tells you) make you friends of the unrighteous Mammon,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.19.</note> that when ye go hence they may receive you into everlaſting habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; thoſe riches which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith have wings, and therefore may flie up, and (being well uſed) may help to carry up your ſoules towards Heaven; if you clip their wings may prove as clogs to weigh your ſoules down to Hell: diſpoſe of them therefore where you may be ſure to find them with an happy advantage to your ſelves, and do not think to keep them ſtill in your hands, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that you are but ſojourners here.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if ye be but ſtrangers and ſojourners here, you muſt make account of no other then hard uſage in the world; it is the juſt Epithete of the world which <hi>Julius Scaliger</hi> gives unjuſtly to <hi>London, Torva peregrinis</hi>; but we cannot add that which follows, <hi>ſed non &amp; inhoſpita</hi>; for ſurely there is nothing to be expected here but unkinde and churliſh intertainment; we know that God ſtill puts together the Stranger, the Widow, and the Orphan; theſe are every where moſt expoſed to wrong; as men are ſtill apt to climb over the hedg where it is loweſt.</p>
                  <p>The good Shunamite, when the Prophet offered her the favour to ſpeak to the King for her, could ſay, <hi>I dwell amongſt my own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>; intimating, that while ſhe dwelt at home amongſt her good Neighbours, ſhe had no need of a Friend at Court. But when ſhe had been abroad ſojourning in the land of the Philiſtims,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Kings.</hi> 8.</note> and in her abſence was ſtripped of her houſe and Land, ſhe is fain to come
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:97700:134"/>
with an humble petition in her hand, ſuing to be righted againſt the injurious uſurpation of her cruel oppreſſour: Do we therefore finde harſh uſage at the hands of the World? are we ſpightfully intreated by unjuſt men, our reputation blemiſhed, our profeſſion ſlandered, our goods plundered, our eſtates cauſeleſly empaired, our bodies impriſoned: and all indignities caſt upon us, and ours? let us bethink our ſelves, where and what we are: ſtrangers and ſojourners here. And let us make no reckoning to fare any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe whiles we ſojourne in this vale of tears.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, if we be ſtrangers and Pilgrimes here, we cannot but have a good mind homeward: It is natural to us all to be dearly affected to our home, and though the place where we ſojourne be handſomer, and more commodious then our own, yet we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſay, Home is homely, and our heart is there, though our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies be away; and this is a difference betwixt a baniſhed man, and a voluntary Traveller; The exiled man hath none but diſpleaſing thoughts for his native Countrey, would fain forget it, and is apt (as we have had too much proof) to deviſe plots againſt it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the voluntary Traveller thinks the time long till he may enjoy his long deſired home; and thinks himſelf happy, that he may ſee the ſmoak of his own chimney; and if our lot be faln upon a ſtony and barren <hi>Ithaca,</hi> yet it is not all the glorious promiſes of a <hi>Calypſo</hi> can withdraw us from deſiring a ſpeedy returne to it; beloved, we know we are ſtrangers here; our home is above. There is our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe, in which there are many manſions, and all glorious: If this earth had as many contentments in it, as it hath miſeries and vexations, yet it could not compare with that region of bleſſedneſſe which is our only home: Oh then if we believe our ſelves to have a true right to that abiding City, to that City which hath foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations where our Father dwels, why do we not long to be poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of thoſe glorious, and everlaſting habitations? we finde it too true which the Apoſtle ſaies, <hi>That whiles we are preſent in the fleſh we are abſent from the Lord.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</note> Why are we not heartily deſirous to change theſe houſes of clay for that houſe not made with hands eternal in the heavens? we may pleaſe our ſelves in formalities, but I muſt tell you it is no good ſign if we be loath to go home to our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe: Me thinks this word (here) ſhould be emphatical; in deed it is not in the original text, but it is both ſufficiently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,

and would ſeem to intimate a kind of compariſon between the place of our ſojourning, and the place of our home. Here is trouble and toil, there is reſt; Here is diſorder and ſin, there per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of order and holineſſe, Here we live with men, yea beaſts, yea, if (on ſome hands) I ſhould ſay with incarnate Devils, I ſhould not be uncharitable, there, with God and his bleſſed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and the ſouls of righteous men made perfect: Here are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall changes and ſucceſſions of ſorrow, there an eternity of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intermitted and unconceivable joyes;<note place="margin">

                  <p>Now, for the time of our ſojourning.</p>
                  <p>Time is the common meaſure of all things, the Univerſal met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wand of the Almighty, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.1. There is a time for all things ſaith wiſe <hi>Solomon,</hi> and but a time; for the motions of time are quick and irrevocable, ye cannot think of it but with wings; It is but a ſhort word, a monoſyllable; yet, whiles we are ſpeaking of it, it is gone. As for the Time of our ſojourning; <hi>Moſes</hi> reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it by years, <hi>Job</hi> by moneths, and thoſe of vanity; old <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> by dayes; the Apoſtle ſhuts it up cloſer; and cals the very age of the World, <hi>hora noviſſima,</hi> the laſt hour: all imply a quickneſſe of paſſage. It is a true obſervation of <hi>Seneca, Velocitas temporis</hi> (ſaith he) the quick ſpeed of time is beſt diſcerned when we look at it paſt, and gone, and this I can confirm to you by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. It hath pleaſed the providence of my God ſo to contrive it, that this day, this very morning fourſcore years ago I was born into the World: a great time ſince, ye are ready to ſay; and ſo indeed it ſeems to you that look at it forward, but to me that look at it as paſt, it ſeems ſo ſhort that it is gone like a tale that is told, or a dream by night, and looks but like yeſterday. It can be no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence for me to ſay that many of you who hear me this day, are not like to ſee ſo many Suns walk over your heads, as I have done; yea, what ſpeak I of this? there is not one of us that can aſſure himſelf of his continuance here one day; we are all Tenants at will, and (for ought we know) may be turned out of theſe clay cottages at an hours warning: oh then what ſhould we do but, as wiſe Farmers who know the time of their leaſe is expiring, and cannot be renewd,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:97700:135"/>
carefully and ſeaſonably provide our ſelves of a ſurer, and more du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring tenure. I remember our witty Countryman <hi>Bromiard,</hi> tels us of a Lord in his time that had a fool in his houſe (as many great men in thoſe dayes had for their pleaſure) to whom this Lord gave a ſtaffe and charged him to keep it till he ſhould meet with one that were more fool then himſelf; and if he met with ſuch a one, to deliver it over to him.</p>
                  <p>Not many years after this Lord fell, ſick, and indeed was ſick unto death: His fool came to ſee him, and was told by his ſick Lord that he muſt now ſhortly leave him; And whither wilt thou go ſaid the fool? Into another World ſaid his Lord; and when wilt thou come again; within a moneth? No; within a year? No: when then? Never. Never? and what proviſion haſt thou made for thy intertainment there whither thou goeſt? None at all: No, ſaid the fool, none at all? Here, take my ſtaffe; Art thou going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way for ever, and haſt taken no order nor care how thou ſhalt ſpeed in that other World whence thou ſhalt never return? take my ſtaffe, for I am not guilty of any ſuch folly as this; and indeed, there cannot be a greater folly, or madneſs rather, then to be ſo wholly taken up with an eager regard of theſe earthly vanities, which we cannot hold, as to utterly neglect the care of that eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which we can never forego; and (conſider well of it) upon this moment of our life depends that eternity either way: My dear Brethren it is a great way to Heaven; and we have but a little time to get thither; God ſayes to us, as the Angel ſaid to <hi>Elijah,</hi> Up, for thou haſt a great journy to go; and if (as I fear) we have loytered in the way; and trifled away any part of the time in vain impertinencies, we have ſo much more need to gird up our loynes, and to haſten our pace; our hearts, our falſe hearts are ready like the Levites ſervant to ſhow us the World, and to ſay as he did of <hi>Jebus, Come I pray you let us turn in to the City of the Jebuſites and lodge there</hi>;<note place="margin">

                  <p>Time is that whereof many of us are wont to be too prodigall; we take care how to be rid of it; and (if we cannot otherwiſe) we caſt it away, and this we call Paſs-time: wherein we do dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:97700:135"/>
miſtake our ſelves; and muſt know that time is, as the firſt, ſo one of the moſt precious things that are: Inſomuch as there are but two things which we are charged to redeem, Time and Truth.</p>
                  <p>I find that in our old ſaxon language, a Gentleman was called an Idle-man, perhaps becauſe thoſe who are born to fair eſtates are free from thoſe toils and hard labours which others are forced to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo. I wiſh the name were not too proper to over-many in theſe dayes, wherein it is commonly ſeen that thoſe of the better rank who are born to a fair inheritance ſo carry themſelves as if they thought themſelves priviledged to do nothing, and made for mere diſport and pleaſure; But alas can they hope that the great God when he ſhall call them to give account of the diſpenſation of their time and eſtate, will take this for a good reckoning. <hi>Item,</hi> ſo many hours ſpent in dreſſing and trimming, ſo many in Idle viſitings, ſo many in gaming, ſo many in hunting and hawking, ſo many in the play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, ſo many in the Tavern, ſo many in vain chat; ſo many in wanton dalliance? No, no my dear Brethren, our hearts cannot but tell us how ill an Audit we ſhall make upon ſuch a wofull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and how ſure we are to hear of a <hi>Serve nequam,</hi> Thou e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Servant, and unfaithfull; and to feele a retribution accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore in the fear of God be exhorted to recollect our ſelves, and ſince we find our ſelves guilty of the ſinfull miſpenſe of our good hours, let us, whiles we have ſpace, obtain of our ſelves to be carefull of redeeming that precious time we have loſt; as the Widow of <hi>Sarepta,</hi> when ſhe had but a little oyle left in her cruſe, and a little meale in her barrell, was carefull of ſpending that to the beſt advantage: ſo let us, conſidering that we have but a little ſand left in our glaſſe, a ſhort remainer of our mortal life, be ſure to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it unto the beſt profit of our ſouls; ſo as every of our hours may carry up with it an happy Teſtimony of our gainfull improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: that ſo, when our day cometh, we may change our time for eternity: the time of our ſojourning for the eternity of glory and bleſſedneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Thus much for the time of our ſojourning; now as for the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of this time, I ſhall ſpare any further diſcourſe of it, though this is a matter well worthy of our thougts; and indeed we that
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:97700:136"/>
live within the ſmoak of the City, have our ears ſo continually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured to the noiſe of paſſing-Bels, that it is a wonder we can think of any thing but our paſſing away, together with our time, unleſs it be with us, as with thoſe that dwell near the Cataract of <hi>Nilus,</hi> whom the continuall noiſe of that loud waterfall is ſaid to make deaf. But ſince we are faln upon the mention of this ſubject, give leave I beſeech you to a word of not unſeaſonable digreſſion. I have noted it to be the faſhion here amongſt you, that when a neighbour dyes, all his friends in ſeverall pariſhes ſet forth their Bells to give a generall notice of his departure; I do not diſlike the practiſe, it is an act of much civility, and fair reſpect to the deceaſed; and if the death of Gods Saints be (as it is) precious in his ſight, there is great reaſon it ſhould be ſo in ours, and therefore well worthy of a publique notification; But let me tell you that in other well-orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red places where I have lived, it is yet a more commendable faſhion, that when a ſick neighbour is drawing towards his end, the Bell is tolled to give notice of his dying condition, that all within hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be thereupon moved to pour out their fervent prayers for the good of that departing ſoul, ſuing for mercy and forgiveneſs, and a clean paſſage of it to the approaching glory; if there be ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility and humanity in the former courſe there is more charity and piety in this; but this by the way.

                  <p>Fear is an unwelcome and unpleaſing word, and the thing more; for we commonly ſay, that onely evill is the object of fear; and that whom we fear we hate; and perhaps, the Authours and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettours of the uncomfortable doctrine of diffidence and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of reſolution in the ſpirituall eſtate of our ſouls, would be glad of ſuch an overture for the maintenance of thoſe diſheartening poſitions which they have broached unto the World to this purpoſe, but their mouthes are ſoon ſtopped, with the addition of the name of a Father, which is abundantly ſufficient to ſweeten this harſh ſound of fear! ſo as this clauſe of the Text may ſeem to be clearly commented upon by that of <hi>Romans</hi> 8.15. <hi>For ye have not received the Spirit of b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That we may ſee then what fear it is which is here recommended to us as an inſeparable companion in this our pilgrimage, know, that there is a baſe kind of fear incident into the worſt of men, yea beaſts, yea Devils; the Devils believe and tremble (ſaith the Apoſtle) and we know the dog fears the whip, and the horſe the ſwitch, and the ſlave fears the laſh of his cruell Maſter, this is therefore called a ſlaviſh fear which though it be not good in it ſelf, yet may have this good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in wicked men to reſtrain them from thoſe villanies which they would otherwiſe commit; and certainly were it not for this, there were no living amongſt men; Earth would be Hell: there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a diſtruſtfull fear in unſetled hearts; which is an anxious doubt leſt God will not be ſo good as his word, and perform thoſe promiſes which he hath made to us; this is highly ſinfull in it ſelf, and infinitely diſhonorable and diſpleaſing unto God; for, if an honeſt man cannot endure to be diſtruſted, how hainouſly muſt the God of truth needs take it that his fidelity ſhould be called into queſtion by falſe-hearted men: The fear that we muſt ever take along with us, is double: A fear of reverence, and a fear of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection; the firſt is that whereof <hi>Malachy</hi> 1.6. <hi>A Son hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth

his Father, and a ſervant his Master, If then I be your Father where is my honour; and if I be your Master where is my fear?</hi> And this fear conſiſts in our awfull and trembling acknowledgment of his dread preſence, in our reverentiall, and adoring thoughts of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteneſs: in our humble and holy deſires to be allowed of him in all things; this is that which wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> more then once tells us in the begining, or (as the word rather ſignifies) the cheif point of wiſdom, and which the Pſalmiſt truly tells is accompanied with bleſſedneſs. The latter which I call a fear of circumſpection, is a due and tender regard to all our wayes, not without an holy jealouſie over our ſelves in all our actions, words, and thoughts, leſt we might do, ſay, or think any thing that might be diſpleaſing to the Majeſty of our God, whereof <hi>Solomon, Bleſſed is the Man that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth alwayes; but he that hardneth his heart ſhall fall into miſchief, Prov.</hi> 28.14.

You that now bid defiance to fear, ſhall in ſpight of you learn the way to fear; yea to tremble, yea to be confounded, at the terrors of the Almighty; Thoſe knees that are now ſo ſtiff, that they will not bow to God, ſhall once knock together; thoſe teeth, through which your blaſphemies have paſſed, ſhall gnaſh, thoſe hands, that were lift up againſt Heaven ſhall ſhake, and languiſh.

                  <p>But for us, dear and beloved Chriſtians, far be it from us, to be of that iron-diſpoſition; that we ſhould never bow but with the fire; no, we have other more kindly grounds of our fear; <hi>Great is thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>that thou maiſt be feared</hi>; Lo, it is the amiableneſs of merits that muſt attract our fear; it is a thing that mainly concernes us to look where and how fears are placed; Far be it from us to bring upon our ſelves the curſe of wicked ones, To fear where no fear is; as this is the common condition of men. Alas, we are apt to fear the cenſures and diſpleaſure of vain greatneſs, whereas that may be a means to ingratiate us with God; ſhame of the World; whereas that may be a means to ſave us from everlaſting confuſion: poverty, whereas that may poſſeſs us of a better wealth; death, whereas to the faithfull ſoul that proves the neceſſary harbinger to eternall reſt and glory; in the mean time the ſame men are no whit afraid of the diſpleaſure of God, and their own perdition; wherein they are like to fooliſh children, who run away from their parents, and beſt friends, if they have but a maske or ſcarfe over their faces, but are no whit afraid of fire or water; Away with all theſe and the like weak miſpriſions; and if we tender our own ſafety, let it be our main care to ſet our fears right; which ſhall be done, if we place them upon our infinitely great and glorious God, in that relation both of mercy and goodneſs, wherein he is here recommended to us, as our Father, and that awfull apprehenſion of Juſtice, wherein he is ſet forth to us as an unpartiall judge of us, and all our actions. Conſider then (that from the duty we may deſcend to the motive) that this fear is of a Father, and therefore a loving fear; but this Father is a judge, and therefore it muſt be an awfull love; how will theſe two go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, a Father and a Judge? the one a ſtile of love and mercy, the other of juſtice. What ever God is, he is all that, he is all love, and mercy; He is all juſtice; That which God is in the pure ſimplicity of his eſſence, we muſt imitate in our compoſitions; namely to unite both theſe in one heart; He is not ſo a judg that he will wave the title and affection of a Father; he is not ſo a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:97700:138"/>
that he will remit ought of his infinite juſtice, in any of his proceedings: upon both theſe muſt we faſten our eyes at once; we muſt ſee the love of a Father to uphold, and chear us; we muſt look upon the Juſtice of a Judge that we may tremble; and therefore putting both together we muſt rejoyce in him with trembling: Droop not, deſpair not, O Man, thou haſt a Father in Heaven: all the bowels of mortall and Earthly parents, are ſtraight to his: If Fathers, if Mothers may prove unnaturall; there is no fear that God ſhould caſt off his mercy, for it is himſelf. Preſume not, O Man; for this Father is a moſt juſt Judge. It is for ſinfull fleſh and blood to be partiall: Fond parents are apt ſo to doat upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of their children, that they are willing to connive at their ſins; either they will not ſee them, or not hate them, or not cenſure them, or not puniſh them; thus many a ſon may (according to the Apologue) bite his Mothers ear when he is climbing up to the gallowes, but the infinite juſtice of the great and holy God cannot be either acceſſary, or indulgent to the leaſt ſin of his deareſt dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon Earth; it is a mad conceit of our Antinomian Hereticks, That God ſees no ſin in his elect; whereas he notes and takes more tenderly their offences then any other; Hear what he ſaith to his <hi>Iſrael; Thee onely have I choſen of all the families upon Earth, therefore will I puniſh thee for all thine iniquities, Amos.</hi> 3.2. But let this be enough to be ſpoken of the conjuncture of theſe two titles of God; <hi>A Father and a Judge</hi>: we cannot hope in the remainder of our hour to proſecute both of them ſeverally; let us onely touch at the former; it is a dear name, this of a Father: and no leſs familiar. It is the firſt word of our Lords prayer; and in the firſt clauſe of our Creed, that which is there the title of his perſonality in Divine relation; is the ſame here in his gracious relation to us: Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo he is in the right of Creation [<hi>He made us, not we our ſelves</hi>] in the right of adoption; [<hi>we have received the adoption of ſons] Galat.</hi> 4.5. In the right of regeneration, [<hi>In that we are made partakers of the divine nature</hi>] 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. I could here loſe my ſelf, and yet be happily beſtowed in the ſetting forth of thoſe infinite priviledges, that we receive from the hands of our God, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this happy ſon-ſhip, but I ſhall balk this theme for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as that we not long ſince largely proſecuted in your ears; and ſhall (as my Text invites me) rather put you in mind how
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:97700:139"/>
vainly we ſhall pretend a right to this Father, unleſs we own him; for the words are [<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>] If ye call him Father as <hi>Beza,</hi> and our former tranſlation turnes it; or (as it is, being a compound word more properly rendred in our preſent verſion) If ye call upon the Father; where you have a ſhort, but true Character of a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Chriſtian laid forth to you; He is one that calls upon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: he ſaith not upon God abſolutely, in the relation to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power which made and governes the World; ſo Jewes and Turks pretend to do: but in the relation to his bleſſed paternity, as the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and in him, ours.</p>
                  <p>Thus he that calls upon the Father profeſſes himſelf a true Chriſtian, ſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes this one of the mottoes of Gods great S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There are three motives of our calling upon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Our duty, our need, and our benefit: Our duty; for that God injoyns it, and accounts it an eſpeciall part of his worſhip, <hi>They ſhall call upon me in the day of their trouble and I will hear them, ſaith God</hi>? Our need, for, as we are of our ſelves deſtitute of all good things, ſo they are onely to be derived to us from Heaven by our prayers: Our benefit, for we are aſſured of all bleſſings for ſuing for; Ask and have. In theſe regards I may truly ſay that man hath no grace nor goodneſs in him that prayes not, both by himſelf and with his family: let him never plead his diſability to expreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his devotion; I never knew begger yet that wanted words to expreſs his wants; were we equallly ſenſible of our ſpirituall defects we ſhould find language enough to bemoan them: this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devotion plainly bewraies a Godleſs heart, careleſs of his duty, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of his need, regardleſs of his benefit, and wholly yielded up to an atheous ſtupidity. On the contrary to pray well, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is an argument of a pious, and graciouſly diſpoſed ſoul; Others may talk to God, and complement with him, perhaps in Scripture termes which they have packt together, and this may be the phraſe of their memory and elocution, but to pour out our ſouls in our fervent prayers, with a due apprehenſion of the majeſty to whom we ſpeak, and a lively ſenſe of our neceſſity, with a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:97700:139"/>
expectation of their ſupplies from Heaven, is for none but godly, and well affected ſuppliants; theſe cannot call upon the Father without a bleſſing; It is a notable and patheticall expoſtulation, which the holy Pſalmiſt uſes to the Almighty, <hi>How long wilt thou be angry with thy people that prayeth</hi>; intimating clearly, that it were ſtrange and uncouth, that a praying people ſhould lie long under a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny judgment, and ſhould not find ſpeedie mercy at the hands of God: Oh then that we could be ſtirred up to a ſerious and effectual performance of this duty for our ſelves, for our Brethren, for the whole Church of God: certainly we could not have been thus miſerable, if we could have heartily called upon the Father of mercies; and if we could yet ply Heaven fervently, and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, with our faithfull devotions, we ſhould not fail of an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py evaſion out of all our miſeries; and find cauſe to praiſe him for his gracious deliverance, and his fatherly compaſſion renewed upon us, and continued to our poſterity after us; which our good God for the ſake of the Son of his love Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to grant unto us. <hi>Amen.</hi>

main Canons for the eſſence of Gods ſervice in the matter of the Euchariſt; here are Rules of order for the outward faſhion of praying and propheſying; theſe may be as variable as the other are conſtant, it is no more poſſible to fit all Churches and Countreys with one form, then to fit all bodies with one ſuit, or all limmes with one ſize. Neither can I with learned <hi>Beza,</hi> and <hi>Cappellus</hi> think that propheſying here is taken for the hearing of propheſyes; theſe things were extraordinarily done till they were reſtrained. In thoſe Primitive times there were ſome women extraordinarily gifted by Gods Spirit who took upon them to preach and pray publickly, which afterwards St. <hi>Paul</hi> forbad to his <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. They, exerciſing theſe manly functions, preſumed to take upon them manly faſhions; whereas therefore bare-headedneſſe was in <hi>Corinth,</hi> as alſo in all <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> a token of honour and ſuperiority, and covering the head a token of ſubjection; theſe forward women u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpe upon the faſhions of their husbands; and will have their faces ſeen as well as their voyces heard; as the Jeſuiteſſes of late time dared both to attempt and practiſe, till the late reſtraint of Pope <hi>Urban</hi> curbed and ſuppreſſed them; Our holy Apoſtle, who was zealouſly carefull to reforme even Soloeciſmes in the outward deportment of Gods ſervice, controlls this abſurd diſorder; and, as the great Maſter of holy ceremonies, injoynes a modeſt vail to the women, when they will ſhow themſelves in theſe acts of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique devotion: <hi>For this cauſe the women ought to have power on their head becauſe of the Angels.</hi>

                  <p>Wherein your ſelves without me obſerve two remarkable heads of our diſcourſe. 1. An Apoſtolicall Canon. 2ly. The carriage or grounds of it. The Canon is fully and home-charged, <hi>The women ought to have power on their head,</hi> The grounds are double; one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, <hi>For this cauſe,</hi> The other ſubſequent; <hi>Becauſe of the Angels,</hi> which in the vulgar, and in St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> is brought in by a <hi>Copulative, &amp;</hi> or <hi>etiam propter Angelos.</hi> From the Canon it ſelf in the generality, you would (of your ſelves) in my ſilence eaſily inferre, that ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſuperiors muſt take care not only of the ſubſtantiall parts of Gods worſhip, but of the circumſtantiall appendances of it; what is a meerer ceremony then our cloathes? what can ſeem of leſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence then a vail left off, or put on; the head may be as good, and as full of holy thoughts bare or covered; what is that (you
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:97700:141"/>
would think) to the heart of our devotion? yet the choſen veſſel fears not to ſeem too ſcrupulous in laying weighty charges upon us in ſo ſmall, and (as we might imagine) unimporting a buſineſs. Certainly, my beloved, though the Kings Daughter be all glorious within and there lies her chief beauty, yet her clothing is of wrought Gold too. And if in the Tabernacle (Gods firſt dwelling place upon Earth) it pleaſed him to give order for the principal ſtuffe of the vails, and curtaines, and frame; for the matter and form of the Ark, and Altars, and Tables of the Face-bread; yet he thought good not to neglect the punctuall directions for the Taches, Snuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, Snuff-diſhes, beeſomes, and the meaneſt requiſites of that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Fabrick: Juſtice and Judgment which are the main buſineſſes of the law muſt be chiefly regarded; but yet even the tithing of mint and anyſe and cummin may not be neglected: Had not <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> the Phariſee meant an hearty welcome to our Saviour, he had never undergone the envy of inviting him to his houſe: but yet our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour finds him ſhort of his due complements, of the hoſpitall kiſs of waſhing, and anoynting: Let no man ſay, what matter is to be made of ſtuffes, or colours, or poſtures? God is a Spirit, and will be worſhipt in Spirit and truth; theſe bodily obſervations are nothing to that ſpirituall and infinite eſſence; what Corinthian Goſſip might not have ſaid ſo to our Apoſtle? yet he ſees the reſpect of theſe circumſtances ſo neceſſary, that the neglect of them may, yea will marr the ſubſtance; and ſurely in all experience, were it not for ceremonies what would become of ſtate, goverment, converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, religion? and yet, of theſe there is great difference, ſome ceremonies are no leſs then ſubſtance to others; and beſide the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of their nature, they have one aſpect as they look toward an impoſing authority, and another as they look toward an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary uſe; It is one thing what men take up out of will or cuſtome, another thing what they conform to out of duty and obedience; ſo as what our ſuperiors (to whom we muſt leave to ſee further then our ſelves) think fit to injoyne us, out of their eſtimation of decency and order, is not now left to the freedom of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection: it is for them to judge, it is for us to obey; neither have we the like reaſon to cenſure them for impoſing things indifferent, which are found by them to conduce unto holy ends, that they have to cenſure us for not obſerving them; herein they are wiſe and juſt, whiles we are conceitedly refractory.</p>

                     <pb n="239" facs="tcp:97700:141"/>I know how little I need to preſs this to a people where I can find nothing but an univerſal conformity; only this touch was needfull if but to ſecond and revive thoſe late meet and expedientorders which we lately commended to your carefull and Chriſtian obſervation.</p>
                  <p>This from the generall and confuſed view of this Apoſtolicall charge: caſt your eyes now upon the particular injunction; <hi>The Woman ought to have power on her Head,</hi> what is this power but a ſignification of her husbands power over her? for it is worth obſerving that the Hebrew word which ſignifies a vail: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, ſignifies alſo power, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> being derived from a root of that ſenſe; ſo as the meaning plainly is, The woman ought to wear that on her head, which may import and teſtifie that ſhe is under her husbands power which is, as the Valentinians read it not amiſs in <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> a vail, or covering; here therefore ye have an evident Metonymy; the thing ſignified which is the husbands power is put for that which ſignifies it, which is the womans vail ſo as this propoſition then lies open to a double conſideration; the one in reference to the thing ſignified, which is the husbands power over the wife, the other in reference to the ſign implying it, which is the wifes vail or covering of the head: of both briefly.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, that the husband hath power over the wife, is ſo clear both in nature, and reaſon, that I ſhall willingly ſave the labour of a proof; it is enough that by her Creatour ſhe was made for an helper: and an helper doth neceſſarily argue a principall; it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, for matter of inſtiution, that he who gave her a will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it ſhould be ſubject to the will of her husband; which how deep an impreſſion it took in very Heathens appears clearly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the Perſian ſages cenſure of <hi>Vaſhti Est.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>And that it may appear the liberty of the Goſpell doth no whit alter the caſe; How do the bleſſed Apoſtles St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> redouble the charge of <hi>wives be ſubject to your Husbands, Coloſ.</hi> 3. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. And inded how is the husband the head if he be not both more eminent, and furniſhed with the faculty of directing the whole body? <hi>A Vertuous woman</hi> ſaith, <hi>Solomon, is the crown</hi> or Diadem <hi>of her Husband, Prov.</hi> 12.3, Lo, ſhe is the crown for the ornament of his head, but if ſhe be vertuous ſhe doth not affect to be the head: and if the Crown be ſet upon the head (as the husband may give honour to the weaker veſſel)
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:97700:142"/>
yet it is a pittyful head that is not better then the crown that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dornes it; but why urge I this? none but ſome mamiſh Monſters can queſtion it, and if there be any ſuch that would fain read the words amiſs, that the <hi>wife hath power over her head,</hi> they are more worthy to be puniſhed by the whip of authority, then by their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſhame, or my cenſure. But to ſay as it is, they are rare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints that we hear of in this kind; I would the contrary were not more frequent; The man hath power over the wife, and he knowes it too well; and uſes it too boiſtrouſly; this ſweet, gentle, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar power which he ſhould exerciſe over his other-ſelf, is dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated in the practiſe of too many into a ſtern Tyranny; according to the old Barbarian faſhion in <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> time which holds even ſtill, their wives are their ſlaves: This is not for the woman to have power on her head; but for the man to have power in his hand, for the hand to have power on the body, an unmanly and ſavage power to the very deſtruction of it ſelf: This kind of cruelty cries unto me daily for redreſſe; and give me leave to cry out againſt it as the moſt odious and abhominable oppreſſion that is incident into him that would be called a man; for the deareneſs of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation aggravates the violence; to ſtrike a beaſt cauſeleſly is unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull; a ſlave, unchriſtian; a ſtranger, furious; a child unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but our own fleſh monſtrous; this is to do that which no man does ſaith our Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.29.</p>
                  <p>There was in the time of <hi>Gregory</hi> 10th. (about 1275) (as our hiſtories tell us) a brood of mad hereticks which aroſe in the Church, whom they called <hi>Flagellantes,</hi> the whippers, which went about through <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> laſhing themſelves to blood.</p>
                  <p>A guiſe, which though at the firſt cryed down, is ſince taken up by ſome miſ-zealous penitents of the Romiſh Church, who do not only take pleaſure, but place merit, in blood; a leſſon taken out, by both of them from the <hi>Baalites</hi> 1 <hi>K.</hi> 18. Men, rather more prodigall of their fleſh then the laviſheſt of theſe late zelots, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what thoſe Bigots did and do out of falſely named religion, theſe husbands of blood (as <hi>Zipporah</hi> miſcalled <hi>Moſes</hi>) do out of a crabbed and imperious cruelty, even draw blood of thoſe bodies which a ſeverall kinne cannot difference from their own.</p>

from thoſe that would paſs for Chriſtians; for you my dear Brethren, let it be enough for me to mention that gracious and needfull charge of our bleſſed Apoſtle (<gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Whiles their heads confeſſe your power, take you heed leaſt your power be abuſed to vex their hearts, and to tyrannize over their bodies.</p>
                  <p>This for the power here ſignified of the Husband over the wife; we deſcend to the ſignification of that power by the covering of the head: an ancient cuſtom and that which was practiſed among all civill Nations; hence the Romans expreſſed the womans mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage by, <hi>nubere,</hi> which ſignifies to vail; whereupon a cloud is termed <hi>nubes</hi> becauſe it is, as a vail, drawn betwixt Heaven and our ſight: Neither doubt I but before all latinity was hatched this was alluded to by <hi>Abimelech, Geneſ.</hi> 20.16. (<hi>Hu ceſeth gnenaiim</hi>) he is the covering of thine eyes; ſaid that Heathen King to <hi>Sarah</hi> concerning her husband; a covering which both protects, and limits the eye: The Apoſtles charge then is that the womans head ought to be covered, to ſhow that ſhe is under anothers power; but how and how farre, and when this covering is required, will require a further diſquiſition: which I ſhall the rather enter into, becauſe I ſee ſome religious, and well affected women carried away with Erroneous opinions concerning this point; whoſe tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences have been abuſed by the miſ-interpretations of ſome igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants to be drawn to hold that this covering muſt be abſolute; and totall, and perpetuall, ſo as if any hair at all be ſeen, it is a viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this charge and their duty; to which purpoſe they urge that verſe 15 as a full commentary upon this text, that the hair was given the woman for a covering; and upon this ground they are apt to cenſure them who take liberty to expoſe any of their hair, though never ſo moderately to others view: I beſeech you dear Brethren and Siſters miſconſtrue me not as one that affect to be a Patron of ruffianly and diſſolute faſhions, of exceſs or immodeſty in this kind; theſe I hate from my ſoul; and muſt tell thoſe vain dames that where ſuch buſhes are hanged out, 'tis an argument that ſomething is expoſed to ſale; but as I would not have you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately wild, ſo I would not have you ſcrupulouſly ſuperſtitious, in reſtraining the due bounds of lawfull Chriſtian liberty, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing

ſin where God never meant it; That I may therefore lay ſome grounds of this my juſt determination, know firſt that in the uſe of garments and theſe outward appendances of the body there is much latitude and variety according to the ſeverall guiſes of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and degrees of perſons: there are Countries the extremity of whoſe cold climate is ſuch that it is no boot to bid both ſexes be covered, yea muffled up, for their own ſafety; there are others ſo ſcorching that will hardly admit of any covering either for head or body; there are ſome whoſe hair is ſo large, that is able to hide them, there are others whoſe curled heads are alike ſhort in both ſexes, and give no advantage to the covering of either: he that made theſe differences of climates and people hath not thought fit to confine them to one univerſall rule, only contenting himſelf with a generall preſcription of decency which in all Countries muſt be regulated according to the cuſtom or conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of the place. For certainly theſe ſacred ceremonies muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the rule of the civill, for that which is held a token of ſubjection to our Princes and other ſuperiors, in all Countries is ſo uſed in the ſervice of the King above all Gods: the Turks and all <hi>Mahumetans</hi> therefore not uncovering their heads to their Baſhaes, or their Grand Lord; keep their heads covered in their devotions: and only by bowing or proſtration teſtifie their humble ſubjection to God. The French Divines preach with their hats on, ours uncovered; both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend good reaſon; and cuſtom for theſe contrary faſhions; neither are either of them to be cenſured as faulty, and exorbitant: and with us we hold the head uncovered if the hat be off, though the cap be on: others make no difference if there be ought at all on the head.</p>
                  <p>Conſider, Secondly, that the hair was given by God both to Men and Women for an ornament: for which cauſe though it paſs in our account for no better then an excreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet it was created together with Man and Woman in their firſt Perfection; Were it not thus, ſurely Baldneſſe would be held a Beauty, and no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And our ſtory tells us that when it was askt why the <hi>Spartans</hi> ſuffred their hair to grow. <hi>Ageſelaus</hi> anſwerd, that was the chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt ornament that belong'd to the body: In a word therefore if our hair were given for a deformity to us, it could but be all hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
                  <p>Let it be Thirdly conſidered that our Apoſtles main drift here is to give order for the habiting of women in the publique aſſemblies, and exerciſes of their devotions, not for their ordinary and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtique attire.</p>
                  <p>Which appears plainly in the 5th. verſe: <hi>Every Woman that prayeth or propheſyeth with her head uncovered, diſhonoreth her head</hi>; he ſaith not, every woman that walkes abroad upon civill occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or, that ſtaies at home upon her houſhold affaires, without a vail on her head, diſhonors her head; and verſe 13. <hi>Judge in your ſelves, is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?</hi> It is a publique prayer that is there meant, parallel to the propheſie before mentioned; both which in theſe firſt times of the Church were in extraordinary uſe; without the danger of a precedent to us, upon whom the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> of the Church, and the ends of the World are at once come. And if there were no more proofs, my Text were enough, which injoynes the vayling of the head is to be uſed becauſe of the Angels; relating (as all interpreters give it) to the publique Congregations of the Saints of God, as we ſhall ſee in the ſequele.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly it muſt be known that this covering of the head hath prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall relation to the face, which is the beſt and moſt conſpicuous part of the head; ſo as it is ſuppoſed that the humility and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty of the woman doth moſt ſhow it ſelf in the vayling of the face from the view of beholders; the back parts of the head not giving ſo much cauſe of note and diſtinction, not ſo much occaſion of temptation to any eye; thoſe therefore who by vertue of this place would have all their hair hid, muſt much more, and upon
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:97700:144"/>
better reaſon contend that their face ſhould be alwayes covered; wherein one abſurdity, and ſervile inconvenience would eaſily draw on another.</p>
                  <p>Shortly then, it followes irrefragably from all this; that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the gariſh, and wanton faſhion of the womans diſſheveling her hair, and the laſcivious turning it into nets for the catching of fond and amorous eyes, be juſtly forbidden both to grave ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, and to chaſt, and well governd Virgins, yet that no law of God, or good reaſon diſallowes ſuch a moderate laying out of ſome part of the hair, as may give a ſafe comelineſs to the face, without the juſt ſcandall of any wiſe beholder.</p>
                  <p>Neither doth that other Text make ought for this fancy; where the Apoſtle tels us that the womans hair was given her for a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; but rather evinces the contrary.</p>
                  <p>The meaning is, it was given her for a covering, actively to cover her, not paſſively to be covered by her.</p>
                  <p>For St. <hi>Paul</hi> intending to ſhow how unſeemly it was for women to ſhow themſelves in publique exerciſes, with a bare face, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen brow, an uncovered hair before the multitude, fetches an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from nature it ſelf, which plainly points her what ſhe ought to do: in that it hath furniſhed her with a native vail, which is her hair: ſince therefore provident nature hath given her a long hair purpoſely to be a cover unto her, it therein ſhowes how fit it is, that her modeſty and diſcretion ſhould provide her ſuch a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering for her head when ſhe will be opening her mouth in the publique aſſembly, as may teſtifie her womanly baſhfulneſſe, and humble ſubjection.</p>
                  <p>To ſhut up this point therefore, there can be no juſt pretence from this, or any other Scripture for this miſ-rayſed ſcrupulouſneſſe. Rather for the contrary the holy Ghoſt ſeemes to make, in that his Divine Epithalamion, wherein he brings in Chriſt the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bridegroom magnifying his bride the Church with this ſweet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion. <hi>Behold, thou art fair my love, Behold thou art fair, thou haſt doves eyes within thy locks; thy hair is as a flock of goates that appear from Mount Gilead. Cantic.</hi> 4.1. Lo, the dove-like eyes of the Church are within her locks; and her hair is not as an hidden flock, but appears; and that in a glorious beauty. Let no well affected Chriſtian bring her ſelf under the bondage of an obſervation which
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:97700:144"/>
God never injoyned, or paſſe a groundleſs and raſh verdict upon others for that which God hath never forbidden; but with a due care of an holy outward decency, Let every one in the fear of God look <hi>to the hidden Man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit, which is in the ſight of God of great price.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4.

                  <p>The former conceit is as groſs as it hath been ancient, of <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> and ſome others, that even ſpirits (to whom they aſcribe a kind of materiality) may be taken with the immodeſt venditation of a fleſhly beauty; to which purpoſe they do ignorantly miſtake that of <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 6.2. <hi>That the Sons of God ſaw the Daughters of Men that they were fair</hi>; not conſidering the ſequel, <hi>that they took them wives of all that they choſe</hi>; Surely, if ever ſpirits have affected theſe fleſhly ſins, yet of marryed Spirits there was never dream in any ſober head.</p>
                  <p>This fancy is too abſurd to merit a confutation: No doubt wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpirits take delight in drawing the Sons of men to inordinate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and beaſtly practiſes; but that themſelves place any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in bodily obſcenities is a matter not eaſie to be believed; Or, if they ſhould be obnoxious to thoſe carnall deſires, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:97700:145"/>
of a vail ſhould any way avail to the reſtraint of their wicked inclinations, and purpoſes it is too poor a thought to enter into any wiſe underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>The other [<hi>viz.</hi> leaſt thoſe Spirits ſhould take this occaſion of tempting] might paſs for currant; if ever we could find in the whole body of the Scripture where the evill ſpirits are abſolutely called Angels without ſome addition of diſtinction, (which is learned <hi>Camerons</hi> obſervation) except only that one, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.3. where they are ſo ſtiled for the greater honour of the Saints that ſhall judge them: However, the truth of the propoſition is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable; that ſo we ought to habit, and order our ſelves, that we may not give advantage to the evill Spirits either to our temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or their prevalence: we may be ſure thoſe tempters will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no occaſion of winning us to filthineſs. Do you not think that when they ſee wanton dames come diſguiſed into Gods houſe, as it were into the box of the play-houſe, with their breſt bare almoſt to the Navel, their armes to the elbow, their necks to the ſhoulder-points, darting their laſcivious eyes every way, and in their whole faſhion and geſture bewraying ſuch lightneſs as might be able to debauch a whole aſſembly, think ye not, I ſay, that they applaud themſelves in ſo rich a booty; as knowing that every eye that is tranſported, and every heart that is fired with that immodeſt gazing-ſtock are ſo many ſpoiles and trophees of their Temptations? It is a true and ſeaſonable word that holy <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaid to the dames of his time that it was not enough for them to keep themſelves from being corrupted by others ſolicitations, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they took care ſo to dreſs and deport themſelves that they might not be occaſions of rayſing wanton thoughts in the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; For ſurely, we can not free our ſelves from thoſe ſins where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in others by our means (though beſides our particular intentions) are inſnared; there is much liberty, I confeſs, in matter of attire, but let me withall give you St. <hi>Pauls Item</hi> to his <hi>Galathians; Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ye have been called to liberty, only uſe not liberty for an occaſion to the fleſh, but by love ſerve one another, Galat.</hi> 5.13.

that no advantage can be let fall againſt our ſouls: as therefore wiſe and carefull commanders do not only caſt how to impugne, oppreſſe, and annoy an enemy, but alſo how to remove thoſe helps which might be advantageous to him in his ſiege, even to the demoliſhing of Suburbs, and ſtopping up of Fountaines, and the like; ſo muſt we do in this ſpirituall warfare of ours; we muſt not only ſtir up our courage and indevors to reſiſt and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh tentations, but we muſt bend our utmoſt care upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and removall of whatſoever, in our apparell, carriage, diet, recreations may be likely to give furtherance to their aſſault, or prevalency: and in the whole practiſe of our lives ſo demean our ſelves as that we may, according to the charge of the Apoſtle <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Good uſe may be made (you ſee) even of this ſenſe; but I take it our Apoſtle intended here to intimate the preſence of, and reſpect to the good Angels.</p>
                  <p>It is no a leſſe comfortable then well-grounded point of Divinity, That none of Gods Children upon Earth want the aſſidence and Miniſtration of thoſe bleſſed ſpirits, we have it from him that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail us. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.10. and the ſweet ſinger of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had warbled out this Heavenly note before him; <hi>The Angels of the Lord encamp about thoſe that fear him, Pſ.</hi> 34.7.

Now theſe, as they guard and attend every of Gods elect ones when they are ſingled and ſequeſtred in the greateſt ſolitarineſs,

ſo we can not think they leave their whether common or ſeverall charges, when they aſſemble together for the exerciſes of piety and devotion: ſo as the publique meetings of Gods Saints can be no other then filled with whole troupes of Angels; This as it is a truth; ſo it was the received opinion of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> as <hi>Capellus</hi> preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantly cites it out of the Sedar <hi>Tephilloth</hi> of the <hi>Portugall Jewes</hi>; in his learned <hi>Spicelegium; Coronam dant tibi Domine Deus noster Angeli, turba illa ſuperna cum populo tuo Iſrael hic inferne Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gato.</hi> O Lord our God the Angels give glory to thee, even thoſe Heavenly troupes that are aſſembled with thy <hi>Iſrael</hi> here below. Out of the reverend and awfull reſpect therefore that is due to theſe glorious (though inviſible) beholders there may no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly thing be done or admitted in the Church of God; and therefore <hi>The Women ought to have power on their Heads becauſe of the Angels</hi>; and ſurely, my beloved, were we fully perſwaded that now at this preſent, there is within theſe walls a greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Angels, then of Men and Women, I ſuppoſe it could not but ſtrike ſuch an awe into us, as to make us at once holily, mannerly and fervently devout: It is a great fault in us Chriſtians that we think of nothing but what we ſee; whereas that ſpirituall, and intelligible World, which is paſt the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of theſe Earthly ſenſes, is far greater, farr more noble and excellent then all viſible and materiall ſubſtances. Certainly there is not one Angel in Heaven that hath not more glory then all this ſenſible World can be capable of: what ſhould I tell you of the excellency of their nature, the height of their offices, the Majeſty of their perſons, their power able to confound a World, their nearneſs both of place and of eſſence to that infinite deity; their tender love and care of man-kind, any of which were able and worthy to take up a whole lives meditation.</p>
                  <p>And if there be ſo much perfection in one, how unconceiveable is the concurrent luſtre, and glory of many: had we eyes to ſee theſe inviſible ſuperviſors of our behaviour we could not, we durſt no let fall any ſo much as indecent geſture before ſuch a preſence. Quicken then (I beſeech you) and ſharpen your eyes, dear and beloved Chriſtians, to ſee your ſelves ſeen even of them whom ye cannot ſee, and let your whole carriage be thereafter; he is not worthy to claim more priveledge then of a beaſt, that can ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:97700:147"/>
but ſenſible objects: brute Creatures can ſee us; if we ſee nothing but our ſelves, and then, wherefore ſerves our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherefore our faith? and if we ſee inviſible beholders why are we not affected accordingly; certainly it were better for us not to ſee then, than, ſeeing, to neglect their preſence.</p>
                  <p>What is then the honor, what the reſpect that we muſt give to the Angels of God who are preſent in our holy aſſemblies: I muſt have leave to complain of two extremities this way: There are ſome that give them too much veneration, there are others that give them no regard at all: In the firſt are thoſe within the Roman Clientele; who are ſo over-curteous as that they give them no leſſe then the honor of adoration, of invocation, reviving herein the erroneous opinion and practiſe of them which <hi>Theodoret</hi> held con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians.</hi> It is the praiſe that <hi>Franciſcus de Sales</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Genua</hi> gives to <hi>Petrus Faber,</hi> one of the firſt aſſociates of <hi>Ignatius Loiola</hi> that his manner was, whenſoever he came to any place he ſtill made ſuit to the Tutelar Angels, that preſided there for their aid of converting the people from hereſie; and found great ſucceſſe in it: This imploration and worſhip is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary; wherein they do that to the Angels, which the Angels themſelves have forbidden to be done: and yet I muſt needs ſay if any creature could be capable of a religious worſhip, it is they; and if any creature were fit to be prayed unto, it is they rather then the higheſt Saints of Heaven: for whereas it is the juſt ground of our refuſing to pray to the Saints that we cannot be ſure of their preſence, and notice, (ſure rather of the contrary) and therefore cannot pray in faith; that ground is here juſtly removed, we are ſure that the Angels of God are preſent with us; we are ſure that they hear us pray; but this is an honor reſerved as peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to the God of Angels, and to that one mediator betwixt God and man, Jeſus Chriſt, thoſe Spirits hate to be made rivals to their maker; neither have we learned that unreaſonable modeſty to ſue to wayters, when we are called up to ſupplicate the King.</p>
                  <p>The other extreme is of careleſſe chriſtians, that do no more think of Angels, then if there were none; ſuffering their bodily eyes to be taken up with the ſight of their aſſembled neighbours, but never raiſing their ſpirituall eyes to behold thoſe ſpiritual eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are no leſſe preſent; and certainly I fear we are all much
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:97700:147"/>
to blame this way; and may juſtly tax our ſelves of an unthankful, dull, irreligious neglect of theſe glorious Spirits; I finde that the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Preiſts in their Morning and Evening prayer ſtill end their devotion with <hi>Macree Kichoon</hi>; Be Angels preſent: and the people ſhout out their <hi>Amen</hi>: and ſhall our piety this way be leſſe than theirs. Surely the Angels of God are inſeparably with us; yea whole cohorts, yea whole Legions of thoſe heavenly ſoldiery are now viewing &amp; guarding us in theſe holy meetings, and we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg them not; we yeild not to them ſuch reverent and awful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects as even fleſh and blood, like our own, will expect from us. Did we think the Angels of God were with us here, durſt thoſe of us which dare not be covered at home (as if the freedom of this holy place gave them priviledge of a looſe and wild licentiouſneſs) affect all ſaucy poſtures, and ſtrive to be more unmannerly then their Maſters?</p>
                  <p>Did we conſider that the Angels of God are witneſſes of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour in Gods houſe, durſt we ſtumble in here with no other reverence then we would do into our Barne, or Stable; and ſit down with no other care then we would in an ale-houſe, or Theater?</p>
                  <p>Did we finde our ſelves in an aſſembly of Angels, durſt we give our eyes leave to rove abroad in wanton glances? our tongues to walk in idle and unſeaſonable chat? our ears to be taken up with frivolous diſcourſe? Durſt we ſet our ſelves to take thoſe naps here whereof we failed on our pillow at home; certainly my beloved, all theſe do manifeſtly convince us of a palpable unreſpect to the bleſſed Angels of God, our inviſible conſorts in theſe holy ſervices.</p>
                  <p>However then it hath been with us hitherto; let us now begin to take up other reſolutions; and ſettle in our hearts an holy aw of that preſence wherein we are; Even at thy home addreſs thy ſelf for the Church; prepare to come before a dreadful Majeſty of God and his powerful Angels; thou ſeeſt them not; no more did <hi>Eliſhaes</hi> ſervant till his eyes were opened: It is thine ignorant and groſſe infidelity that hath filmed up thine eyes, that thou canſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerne no ſpiritual object; were they but anointed with the eye-ſalve of faith, thou ſhouldeſt ſee Gods houſe full of heavenly glory, and ſhouldeſt check thy ſelf with holy <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he awaked from his divine viſion; <hi>Surely the Lord is in this place and I knew it not; how

Oh then when thou ſetteſt thy foot over the threſhold of Gods Temple tremble to think who is there, lift up thine awfull eyes, and bow thine humble knees, and raiſe up thy devout and faithful ſoul to a religious reverence and fear of thoſe mighty and Majeſtical Spirits that are there; and of that great God of Spirits, whoſe both they and thou art; and ſtudy in all thy carriage to be approved of ſo glorious witneſſes and overſeeres. That ſo at the laſt thoſe bleſſed Spirits with whom we have had an inviſible converſation here, may carry up our departing ſoules into the heaven of heavens, into the preſence of that infinite, and incomprehenſibly-glorious God, both theirs and ours, there to live and raign with them in the participation of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable bliſſe and glory. To the fruition whereof he that hath ordained us, graciouſly bring us by the mediation; and for the ſake of his bleſſed Son Jeſus; To whom with thee O Father of Heaven, and thy co-eternall Spirit, three perſons in one God, be given all praiſe, honor, immortality now and for ever.</p>

cuſtome; and ſurely, if we follow the guidance of theſe three, we cannot eaſily erre in our deciſion of comlineſſe both in our carriage in humane affaires, and in the ſervices of God; all theſe will tell us that it is moſt meet that all outward cleanlineſs gravity, modeſty, reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, ſhould be uſed in all the actions of divine worſhip; and will in form us that whatſoever faſhion of deportment is held rude &amp; unci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in humane converſation, is ſo much more indecent in divine acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by how much the perſon whom we deal with is more awful, and worthier of the higheſt obſervance.</p>

                  <p>God hath no where commanded us to cut our nailes, or our hair; but it were a foul indecency not to do both: and if we would juſtly loath a man that ſhould come to our table like wild <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> in the deſert, with hair to his waſt, and clawes on his fingers, how much more odious would this ſeem in a man, that ſhould thus thruſt himſelf in to the Table of the Lord? and if our diſpleaſure would juſtly ariſe at that barbarous gueſt, which ſhould come to our board with his hands be ſmeared with ordure or blood, how can we think it can be otherwiſe then ill-taken of the holy God, that we ſhould in a beaſtly garbe offer our ſelves into his preſence.</p>

                  <p>To which purpoſe let it paſſe for a ſure rule that there is a kinde of Relative holineſs in perſons, things, times, places, actions: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, I ſay, not inherent in themſelves but in reference to their uſe, and deſtination; and in the ſecond place, that even this kind of holineſſe challengeth a reverent reſpect from us: A perſon whoſe profeſſion is holy, by his ſolemn conſecration to God, ſhould and ought to carry more veneration from us then every common man. The holy elements in the ſacrament, being now ſet apart to this divine uſe, ſhould be otherwiſe regarded of us then the common bread, and wine at the Tavern: in reſpect of that bleſſed myſtery whereto they are appropriated: Gods holy day is held worthy of more reſpect from us, then all the dayes in the year beſides; and why ſhould it not be ſo likewiſe in places and actions? Even in our own houſes we obſerve a decency, and different regard of rooms; hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it unbeſeeming that the buſineſſes of the ſcullery ſhould be done in our parlour, or that our bed-chamber ſhould be made a larder: And can we think it leſſe uncomly to put Gods peculiar houſe to the uſe of a kitchin, or ſtable? Surely, the ſervice wherto it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, and the name that it bears, ought to priviledge it from all either baſe, or profane imployment.</p>
                  <p>As for ſacred actions, as they have more life in then the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward circumſtances of time and place, ſo they do juſtly require more reſpect in the managing of them; in our petitions, if we come to earthly princes upon our knees, with an awful reverence; how much more ought we to do ſo to the King of glory? In our receit of the bleſſed Euchariſt, our demeanure muſt be no other then ſuch as may become the gueſts of the great King of Heaven, and the commenſals of the Lord Jeſus, of whom and with whom we do then communicate; in hearing or reading the Divine Oracles, our
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:97700:151"/>
deportment muſt be ſuch, as may argue our putting a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the word of the ever-living God; and the fallible dictates of mortal men like our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>And as it is in outward decency and cleanlineſs, ſo alſo in the matter of coſt, or handſomeneſs (at leaſt) in the utenſils and ſtructures that belong to God; wherein it is a marvel how much we in this laſt age of the world have varied from our predeceſſours, in the firſt eſtabliſhment of Chriſtianity: <hi>Nihil refert ſive ex auro, ſive ex ligno ſit Templum; ſive ſit stabulum ſicut in Bethleem, ſive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia domus ſicut in Jeruſalem.

Ere we deſcend to the matter; Three termes require
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:97700:155"/>
a little clearing, what this calling is? What election? What the ſure-making of both?</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt; this cannot be taken of an outward calling: For we are ſure enough of that; whereſoever the Goſpel is preached we are called outwardly; neither are we much the nearer to be ſure of that, <hi>for many are called, few choſen,</hi> yea certainly this not anſwered ſhall aggravate our damnation; It is therefore an inward and effectuall calling that we muſt endeavour to make ſure: a call, not by the ſound of the word only, but by the efficacy of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: The ſoul hath an ear as well as the body, when the ear of the ſoul hears the operative motions of Gods ſpirit, as well as the ear of the body hears the external ſound of the Goſpel: then are we called by God, when true faith is wrought in the Soul, as well as outward conformity in our life; when we are made true Chriſtians as well as outward profeſſors, then, and not till then have we this calling from God.</p>
                  <p>Such then is our calling; the election is anſwerable to it; Not a temporal, and external, to ſome ſpecial office, or dignity; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of our Saviour, <hi>Have not I choſen you twelve. John.</hi> 6.70. <hi>and Moſes his choſen, Pſal.</hi> 106. Not a ſingling out from the moſt, to an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſion of Chriſt, whereof perhaps the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Knowing, beloved, that ye are elect of God,</hi> and the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is he whom thou chooſeſt and cauſeſt to dwell in thy courts, Pſal.</hi> 65.5. For notwithſtanding this noble and happy priviledge, little would it availe us to be ſure of this, and no more; no profeſſion, no dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity can ſecure us from being perfectly miſerable, but an eternal election to glory; whereof <hi>St. Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. <hi>God hath choſen us in Chriſt before the foundations of the World, that we might be holy, and blamleſſe before him in love</hi>; and to his <hi>Coloſſians, As the elect of God holy and beloved</hi>; ſuch as to whom ſaving Faith is appropriated, the ſtyle whereof is <hi>Fidus electorum, the faith of the Elect, Tit.</hi> 1.1.</p>
                  <p>Such then is our calling, and elction. Now this calling, this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection muſt be made ſure or firme, as the word (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) ſignifies: ſure and firme, not on Gods part who we know is unchangble in his nature, in his counſels. So as in that regard our election (if it be at all is moſt ſure, and ſurer cannot be; but on ours, not only in reſpect of the object, which is the truth, and immutability of the thing it ſelf; but in reſpect of the ſubject too, the ſoul that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:97700:155"/>
it; ſo ſure that it cannot be falſified, cannot be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
                  <p>It is not for us to expect ſuch a certainty of knowledg in this point as there is of Principles of Arts, or of thoſe things whereof common ſence aſſures us. Our Schoolmen make diſtinction of a certainty, evident, and inevident: Evident, which ariſeth out of the clearneſs of the object it ſelf; and the neceſſary connection of the termes, as that the whole is greater then a part. Inevident, which ariſes not ſo much out of the intrinſecal truth of the propoſition it ſelf, as out of the veracity and infallibleneſs of the party that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes it. So both Divine and Humane faith receive their aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the Divine or Humane authority whereon it is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and this inevident aſſurance may be ſo certain as to expel all prevailing doubt, though not all troubling doubt: Neither need there any other for the Articles of our creed which we take upon the infallible truſt of him who is the truth it ſelf, and can no more deceive us then, not be.</p>
                  <p>This latter is the certainty, which we muſt labour to attain unto. In the grant whereof our Romiſh Divines are generally too ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced, yielding yet a Theological certainty which goes farr but not home: although ſome of them are more liberal, as <hi>Catharinus, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga, Ruardus, Tapperus,</hi> and <hi>Pererius</hi> following them, which grant that ſome holy men, out of the feeling and experience of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Gods Spirit in them, may without any ſpeciall revelation grow to a great height of aſſurance; if not ſo as that they may ſwear they are aſſured of this happy eſtate of grace, yet ſo, as that they may be as confident of it, as that there is a <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which one would think were enough: but the reſt are commonly too ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, in the inching out of the poſſibilitie of our aſſurance by nice diſtinctions: <hi>Cardinal Bellarmine,</hi> makes ſix kindes, or degrees of certainty; whereof three are clear, three obſcure; the three firſt are the certainty of underſtanding, the certainty of knowledg, the certainty of experience; The firſt of them is of plain principles, which upon meer hearing are yielded to be moſt true, without any traverſe of thoughts: The ſecond is of concluſions, evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deduced from thoſe principles, The third is of the matters of ſenſe about which the eye, or eare is not deceived.</p>
                  <p>The three latter certainties which are more obſcure are thoſe
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:97700:156"/>
of Faith, or Beleefe, and the degrees thereof; The firſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is the certainty of the Catholick or Divine faith, which depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon Gods authority cannot deceive us. The ſecond is the certainty of humane faith; ſo depending upon Mans authority, and in ſuch matters, as ſhut out all fear of falſhood, or diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in believing them: as that there was an <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> a <hi>Rome,</hi> a <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The third is the certainty of a well grounded conceit which he pleaſeth to call conjecturall; raiſed upon ſuch undoubted ſignes, and proofs, as may make a Man ſecure of what he holdeth; and excludes all anxiety, yet cannot utterly free him from all fear. This laſt he can be content to yield us; and indeed in his ſtating, the queſtion ſtands onely upon the deniall of the certainty of a Divine faith in this great affair: we are ready to take what he gives, ſo as then here may be a certainty in the heart of a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Man, of his calling and election; and ſuch a one as ſhall ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him holily ſecure; and free from anxiety; Let the diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er weary himſelf with the thoughts of reconciling certitude with conjectures; ſecurity with fear; let us have the ſecurity, and let him take the fear to himſelf: Shortly then, whiles the Schools make much ado of what kind of certainty this muſt be taken, whether of faith, or of hope, or of confidence: ſurely, if it be ſuch an hope and confidence as makes not aſhamed by diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing us, both are equally ſafe; It is enough if it be ſuch a fidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall perſwaſion as cannot deceive us, nor be liable to falſhood.</p>
                  <p>But how far then reaches this aſſecuration?</p>
                  <p>So far as to exclude all fears, all doubting, and heſitation? Neither of theſe.</p>
                  <p>Not all kind of fear; <hi>for we are bidden to work out our ſalvation with fear and trembling, Philip.</hi> 2. and to ſpend <hi>the time of our pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage in fear,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. Not doubting, which the counſell of <hi>Trent</hi> would ſeem to caſt upon our opinion; we cannot be ſo ſenſeleſs, as not in the conſcience of our infirmities, and manifold indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions find our ſelves put to many plunges: but yet ſo, as that by the power of our faith (which is the victory that overcomes the World) at laſt we do happily recover, and find our ſelves freed by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and joyfull <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

never be turned up by the roots, never removed, after we are faſt planted, and grounded in the houſe of God, he takes us aright; This is a certainty that we may, that we muſt, labour to aſpire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; <hi>Commo vetur ſides, non excutitur,</hi> as <hi>Chamier</hi> well; We muſt therefore give all diligence to make this effectuall calling, this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall election thus ſure unto us.</p>
                  <p>Mark in what order; firſt our calling, then our election: nor beginning with our election firſt; it were as bold; as abſurd a preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in vain Men, firſt to begin at Heaven, and from thence to deſcend to Earth. The Angels of God upon <hi>Jacobs</hi> ladder both aſcended and deſcended, but ſurely, we muſt aſcend onely from Earth to Heaven by our calling, arguing our election; If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of Gods working, and proceeding with us, it is one thing, there he firſt foreknowes us, and praedeſtinates us, then he calls us, and juſtifies us, then he glorifies us. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29.30.</p>
                  <p>If we conſider the order of our apprehending the State wherein we ſtand with God, there we are firſt called, then juſtified, and thereby come to be aſſured of our predeſtination, and glory. Think not therefore to climb up into Heaven, and there to read your names in the book of Gods eternall decree, and thereupon to build the certainty of your calling, believing, perſevering; this courſe is preſumptuouſly prepoſterous: but by the truth of your effectuall calling, and true believing grow up at laſt towards a comfortable aſſurance of your election; which is the juſt Methode of our Apoſtle here, <hi>Make your calling and election ſure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mark then the juſt connexion of theſe two; If the calling, then the election; one of theſe doth neceſſarily imply the other, many Thouſands are outwardly called, who yet have no right in Gods eternall election; here is as much difference as between many and few; But where the heart is effectually called home to God, by a true and lively faith applying the promiſes of God, and laying effectuall hold of Chriſt, there is certainly an election.

us off from true and ſolid comforts. But if there be falſe ſaith we know there are true ones; yea there could not be falſe, if there were not a true one; ſo much more muſt be our diligence to make ſure work for our Faith, and by that, for our calling, which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained will evince our election. As Men when they hear there are many conterfeit ſlips, and much waſhed and clipped coyne abroad, are the more carefull to turn over, and examine every peece that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth through their hands. So then thoſe whom God hath thus joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, neither Man nor Devil can put aſunder, Our calling, and Election.</p>
                  <p>Three heads then offer themſelves here to our preſent diſcourſe. 1. <hi>That our Calling and Election may be made ſure.</hi> 2. That we muſt endeavour to make them ſure. 3ly. How and by what means, we may and muſt endevor to aſſure them.</p>
                  <p>As for the firſt of theſe, the very charge and command it ſelf implyes it. The juſtice of God doth not uſe to require impoſſible things from us; when therefore he bids us g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Let us then a little inquire into the faiſibleneſs of this great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of our holy and Chriſtian diligence; And cettainly, if there be any let in the poſſibility of this aſſurance, it muſt be either in our preſent faith, or in the perpetuation of it; for in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of a lively faith with ſalvation, it cannot be; That he who effectually believes, and perſeveres to the end ſhall be ſaved, no man, no Devil can deny; all the doubt is whether the man can know that he doth thus believe, that he ſhall continue ſo to believe. And why ſhould there be any doubt in either of theſe? I am ſure for the firſt; the choſen veſſel could ſay, <hi>I know whom I have believed,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. and ſpeaks this not as an extraordinary perſon, (an Apoſtle) but as a Chriſtian; therein affirming both the act of his faith, and the object of it, and his knowledg of both; for whiles he ſaith, <hi>I know whom I have believed,</hi> he doth in effect ſay, I know that I have believed, and I know what I have believed; God my Almighty Saviour is the object of my faith, my faith layeth ſure hold on this object, and I know that my faith laies undoubted hold on this happy object. <hi>I know whom I have believed</hi>; and why ſhould not we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to ſay ſo too? Some things the Apoſtle did as a ſingular favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:97700:158"/>
of Heaven, of this kinde were his raptures and viſions, theſe we may not aſpire to imitate; other things he did as an holy man, as a faithful Chriſtian, theſe muſt we propoſe for our examples; and indeed, why ſhould not a man know he believes? What is there in faith (even as we define it) but knowledg, aſſent, applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, affiance, receiving of Chriſt, and which of theſe is there that we cannot know? Surely there is power in the ſoul to exerciſe theſe reflexe actions upon it ſelf. As it can know things (contrary to the fanatick ſcepticke) ſo it can know that it knowes; Theſe inward acts of knowledg, and underſtanding are to the mind, no other, then the acts of our ſenſitive powers are unto our ſenſes, and a like certain judgment paſſeth upon both: as therefore I can know that I hear, or that I ſee, or touch; ſo can I no leſſe ſurely know that I do know, or underſtand.</p>
                  <p>And the object doth no whit alter the certainty of the act; whiles a divine truth goes upon no leſſe evidence and aſſurance, why may not a man as well know that he knowes a divine truth, as an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane?</p>
                  <p>The like is to be ſaid of thoſe other ſpecialties which are required to our faith; Our faith aſſents to the truth of Gods promiſes; what ſhould hinder the heart from knowing that it doth aſſent? Do not I know whether I believe a man on his word? Why ſhould I not know the ſame of God? when an honeſt man hath by his promiſes ingaged himſelf to me to do me a good turne, do not I know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I truſt to him, whether I make uſe of that favour in a confident reliance upon the performance of it? the caſe is the ſame betwixt God and us; Only we may be ſo much the more infallibly aſſured of the promiſed mercies of our God, by how much we do more know his unfailingneſs, his unchangeableneſs.</p>
                  <p>Yea ſo fecible is this knowledg, as that our Apoſtle chargeth his <hi>Corinthians</hi> home in this point, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Prove your ſelves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye be in the faith; Trye your ſelves, know ye not your own ſelves that Christ Jeſus is in you except ye be Reprobates; what can be more full?</hi> To be in the faith is more then to believe; it intimates an habit of faith, that is more then an act; Now what proof, what tryal can there be of our faith if we cannot know that we have faith? Surely a tryal doth ever preſuppoſe a knowledg, If a man did not know which were good gold, to what purpoſe doth he go to the Teſt?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="273" facs="tcp:97700:158"/>Now how dwells Chriſt in us but by Faith? So may they, ſo muſt they know Chriſt to be in them, that if they have him not, they are reprobates: And if they know not they have him, they can have no comfortable aſſurance againſt their reprobation. See then how emphaticall and full this charge is; He ſaith not, Gueſs at your ſelves; but prove and try your ſelves: He ſaith not, do ye not morally conjeſture? but, do ye not know: He ſaith not, wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ye hope well, but, whether ye be in the Faith; And that, not of the Faith of Miracles, as <hi>Chryſostome,</hi> and <hi>Theophilact</hi>; nor of a Faith of Chriſtian profeſſion, as <hi>Anſelme</hi>; but ſuch a Faith as whereby Chriſt dwells in our hearts; He ſaith not, Laſtly, unleſs ye be faulty, and worthy of blame, but, unleſs ye be reprobates: The place is ſo choakingly convictive, that there can be no proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eluſion of it.</p>
                  <p>The ſhift of Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (wherein yet he would ſeem confident) is worthy of pity; that the place hath no other drift but to imply the powerfull preſence of Chriſt amongſt the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>; ſtrongly confirming the truth of his Apoſtleſhip; whereby, if there were any faith at all in them, except they were given up to a reprobate ſenſe, they muſt needs be convinced of the authority of his Miniſtery; for what was this to their being in the faith, whereof they muſt examine themſelves? or, who can think that to be in the faith is no more then to have any faith at all? Neither doth the Apoſtle ſay, that Chriſt is among you, but in you; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could the not knowing of Chriſts preſence amongſt them by powerfull Miracles, be a matter of reprobation; ſo as this ſenſe is unreaſonably ſtrained to no purpoſe; and ſuch as no judicious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit can reſt in, and this act of our knowledg is taken for granted by him that works it in us.</p>
                  <p>And indeed what queſtion can there be of this act when God undertakes it in us? <hi>The Spirit of God witneſſeth with our Spirits, that we are the Sons of God, Rom.</hi> 8.16. Can any Man doubt of the truth of Gods Teſtimony? Certainly, he that is the God of truth cannot but ſpeak truth; now he witneſſeth together with us. Yea but you ſay, though he be true yet we are deceitfull, and his Spirit doth but witneſs according to the meaſure of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and capacity, which is very poor and ſcant, yea and perhaps alſo uncertain. Take heed, whoſoever thou art, leaſt thou diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:97700:159"/>
God, whiles thou wouldſt abaſe thy ſelf; he witneſſeth together with us; The Spirit of truth will not witneſs with a lying Spirit; were not therefore that witneſs of ours ſure, he would check us, and not witneſs with us: Now what witneſs can he give with us, and to us if we do not hear him, if we do not know what he ſaies; if we cannot be aſſured of what he teſtifies? Let no <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> ſpeak now of an experiment of inward ſweetneſs and peace, which onely cauſeth a conjecturall, and not an unfailing certainty: The Man hath forgot that this Teſtimony is of the Spirit of adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby we do not ſeem Sons, but are made ſo, and are ſo aſſured: and that it is not a gueſs, but a witneſs; and Laſtly that there can be no true inward peace out of mere conjectures. Yea, here is not onely the word of God for it; but his ſeale too; and not his ſeale only, but his earneſt; what can make a future match more ſure then hand and ſeale? and here we have them both. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22.

And have we the promiſe, hand, ſeale, earneſt of Gods Spirit, and not ſee it, not feel it, not know it?</p>
                  <p>Shortly, whom will we believe if not God, and our ſelves? No Man knowes what is in Man, but the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of Man that is in him, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> to his <hi>Corinthians.</hi> Ye have heard Gods Spirit; hear our own; out of our own mouth. Doth not every Chriſtian ſay, I believe in God, &amp;c. I believe in Jeſus Chriſt; I believe in the holy Ghoſt; I believe the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints, the forgiveneſs of ſins, and life Everlaſting? And doth he ſay he believes when he believes not, or when he knows not whether he believe, or no, what a mockery were this of our Chriſtian profeſſion? Or, as the Jeſuitical evaſion commonly is, is this only meant of an aſſent to theſe general truthes, that there

is a God, a Saviour, a ſanctifyer, Saints, remiſſion, ſalvation, not a ſpecial application of theſe ſeveral articles to the ſoul of him whoſe tongue profeſſeth it? Surely then, the devil might ſay the creed no leſs confidently, then the greateſt Saint upon Earth: There is no Devil in hel but believes (not without regret) that there is a God that made the World, a Saviour that redeemed it, a bleſſed Spirit that renewes it, a remiſſion of ſins, an eternal Salvation to thoſe that are thus redeemed, and regenerate; and if in the profeſſion of our faith we go no further then Devils, how is this <hi>Symbolum Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianorum?</hi> To what purpoſe do we ſay our creed?</p>
                  <p>But if we know that we believe for the preſent, how know we what we ſhall do? what may not alter in time? we know our own frailty and fickleneſſe; what hold is there of us weak wretches, what aſſurance for the future?

                  <p>And this he ſaies not for himſelf only, (leaſt any with <hi>Pererius,</hi> and ſome other Jeſuites, ſhould harp upon a particular Revelation) but who ſhall ſeparate us? he takes us in with him; and if he ſeem to pitch upon his own perſon in his (<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>) yet the ſubject of this perſwaſion reacheth to all true believers, <hi>That nothing can ſeparate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jeſus our Lord:</hi> Us, not as it is over-ſtretched by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> indefinitely, for thoſe that predeſtinate in generall, but with an implyed applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it to himſelf, and the believing Chriſtians to whom he wrote; The place is ſo clear and full, that all the miſerable and ſtrained Evaſions of the Jeſuiticall gainſayers cannot elude it; but that it will carry any free and unprejudiced heart along with it; and evince this comfortable truth, That, as for the preſent, ſo for the future we may attain to be ſafe for our ſpirituall condition.</p>
                  <p>What ſpeak I of a ſafety that may be, when the true believer is ſaved already? already paſt from death to Life; already there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore over the threſhold of Heaven. Shortly then our faith may make our calling ſure; our calling may make ſure our election; and we may therefore confidently build upon this truth <hi>that our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and election may be made ſure.</hi>

                  <p>Now many things may be done, that yet need not, yea that ought not to be done; This both ought and muſt be indeavored, for the neceſſity, and benefit of it. This charge here as it implies the poſſibility, ſo it ſignifies the convenience, uſe, profit, neceſſity of this aſſecuration, for ſure if it were not beneficiall to us, it would never be thus forceably urged upon us; And certainly there needs no great proof of this. For nature and our ſelf-love grounded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon eaſily invites us to the indeavour of feoffing our ſelves in any thing that is good; this being then the higheſt good that the Soul of Man can be poſſibly capable of, to be aſcertained of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will ſoon follow, that ſince it may be done, we ſhall reſolve it ought, it muſt be indeavored to be done.</p>

                     <pb n="277" facs="tcp:97700:160"/>Indifferent things, and ſuch as without which we may well ſubſiſt are left arbitrary to us; but thoſe things wherein our ſpirituall well-being conſiſteth muſt be mainly laboured for; neither can any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention be too much to attain them; ſuch is this we have in hand; without which there can be no firm peace, no conſtant, and ſolid comfort to the Soul of Man; Three things then call us to the indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of this aſſurance; our duty, our advantage, our danger.</p>
                  <p>We muſt do it out of duty; becauſe our God bids us; Gods commands like the <hi>Prerogatives</hi> of Princes muſt not be too ſtrictly ſcanned; ſhould he require ought that might be loſſe-full, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to us, our blindfold obedience muſt undertake it with cherefulneſſe; how much more then, when he calls for that from us, then which nothing can be imagined of more, or equall behoof to the Soul. It is enough therefore that God by his Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to <hi>Give diligence to make our calling and election ſure</hi>; Our Heavenly Father bids us, what ſons are we if we obey him not? Our bleſſed Maſter bids us, what Servants are we if we ſet not our ſelves to obſerve his charge? our glorious and immortall King bids us, what ſubjects are we if we ſtick at his injunction? out of mere duty therefore we muſt indeavour <hi>to make our calling, and election ſure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Even where we owe no duty, oftentimes advantage drawes us on; yea many times acroſs thoſe duties which we owe to God and Man; how much more where our duty is ſeconded with ſuch an advantage, as is not parallelable in all the World beſide.</p>
                  <p>What leſſe, what other followes upon this aſſurance truly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained but peace of conſcience, and joy in the holy Ghoſt? in one word, the begining of Heaven in the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>What a contentment doth the heart of Man find in the ſecuring of any whatſoever good? what a coyle do mony-Maſters keep for ſecurity of the ſummes they put forth; and when that is taken to their mind are ready to ſay with the rich Man in the Goſpel, <hi>Soul take thy eaſe.</hi> Great venturers at Sea how willingly do they part with no ſmall part of their hoped gain to be aſſured of the reſt? How well was <hi>Ezekiah</hi> appaid, when he was aſſured but of fifteene years added to his life? How doth <hi>Babylon</hi> applaud her own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to her ſelf, when ſhe can ſay, <hi>I ſit as a Queen, I ſhall not be a widdow, I ſhall know no ſorrow: It muſt needs follow therefore that in</hi>
                     <pb n="278" facs="tcp:97700:161"/>
the beſt things aſſured there muſt be the greateſt of all poſſible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments.</p>
                  <p>And ſurely, if the heart have once attained to this, that upon good grounds it can reſolve, God is my Father, Chriſt Jeſus is my Elder Brother, the Angels are my Guardians; Heaven is my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted patrimony, how muſt it needs be lift up, and filled with a joy unſpeakable and glorious? What bold defiances can it bid to all the troupes of worldly evils, to all the powers of Hell? with what unconceiveable ſweetneſs muſt it needs injoy God, and it ſelf? how comfortably and reſolutely muſt it needs welcome death, with that triumphant champion of Chriſt, <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith, and now from henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7, 8. Out of the juſt advantage therefore of this aſſurance we muſt endeavour to <hi>make our calling and election ſure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither is the advantage more in the performance hereof then there is danger in the neglect. In all uncertainties there is a kinde of afflictive fear, and troubleſome miſ-doubt: Let a man walk in the dark, becauſe he cannot be confident where ſafely to ſet his ſteps, he is troubled with a continual ſuſpicion of a ſuddain miſ-cariage, and therefore goes in pain; what can there be but diſcomfort in that ſoul which knowes not in what termes it ſtands with God? Yet, whiles there is life, there may be hope of better; But if that ſoul be ſurpriſed with an unexpected death, and hurried away with ſome ſuddain judgment, in this ſtate of irreſolution, in how deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a condition is it beyond all expreſſion? I cannot but therefore la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the woful plight of thoſe poor ſouls that live &amp; die under the Roman diſcipline, who when they have moſt need of comfort in the very act of their diſſolution are left pitifully diſconſolate, and given up by their teachers to either horror, or ſuſpence. Even the moſt Saint-like of them; (except his ſoul fly up in Martyrdom like <hi>Gede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> Angel in the Smoke of his incenſe) may not make account of a ſpeedy aſcent to heaven; inſomuch as Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf, of whom our <hi>Coffin</hi> dares write that his life was not ſtayned with mortal ſin, (<hi>pag.</hi> 27.) He that could call heaven <hi>Caſamia</hi>; and whoſe canonization the Cardinals thought fit to be talked of in his ſickneſs; when Cardinal <hi>Aldobrandino</hi> deſired him, that when he came to heaven he would pray for him, anſwered, To go to heaven ſo
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:97700:161"/>
ſoon is a matter too great for me; men do not uſe to come thither in ſuch haſt, and for me, I ſhall think it no ſmall favour to be ſure of purgatory, and there to remain a good while (<hi>pag.</hi> 42.) (which yet (himſelf can ſay) differs not much, for the time, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the extremity of it, from hell it ſelf) and to be a good while there? O terror paſt all reach of our thoughts; <hi>And if the righteous be thus ſaved, where ſhall the ſinners appear</hi>?</p>
                  <p>For ought they can, or may know; hell may, but purgatory muſt be their portion, heaven may not be thought of without too high preſumption.</p>
                  <p>Certainly if many deſpair under thoſe uncomfortable hands I wonder that no more; ſince they are bidden to doubt, and beaten off from any poſſibility of the confidence of reſt and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p>But whiles I urge this danger of utter diſcomfort in our irreſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I hear our adverſaries talke of a double danger of the contrary certitude; A danger of pride, and a danger of ſloth. The ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed certainty of our graces breeds pride ſaith their Cardinal; The aſſurance of our election, ſloth, ſaith their <hi>Alphonſus a Caſtro,</hi> out of <hi>Gregory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed if this cordial doctrine be not well given, well taken, well digeſted, it may, through our pravity, and heedleſneſs turne to both theſe noxious humors; as the higheſt feeding ſooneſt cauſeth a dangerous Plethory in the body. How have we heard ſome bold un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded Chriſtians brag of their aſſurance of glory, as if they had carried the keyes of heaven at their Girdle? How have we ſeen even ſenſual men flatter themſelves with a confident opinion of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted ſafety; &amp; unfailable right to happineſs? How have we known preſumptuous Spirits that have thought themſelves carried with a plerophory of faith when their ſailes have been ſwelled only with the winde of their own ſelf-love? how many ignorant ſoules from the miſ-priſion of Gods infallible election have argued the needleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their indeavours, and the ſafety of their eaſe and neg-lect? As ye love your ſelves, ſail warily, betwixt theſe rocks and ſands on either ſide.</p>
                  <p>But if theſe miſchiefs follow upon the abuſe of a ſound and wholſome doctrine, God forbid they ſhould be imputed to the truth it ſelf; as if that God who charges us to do our indevour to
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:97700:162"/>
make ſure work of our calling and election did not well foreſee the perills of theſe miſ-takings; and if notwithſtanding the previſion of theſe errors his infinite wiſdom hath thought fit to injoyne this task, how ſafe how neceſſary is it for us to perform it? Did theſe evils flow from the nature of the doctrine, we had reaſon to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim it; but now that they flow from the corruption of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, fetching evill out of good, we have reaſon to embrace the doctrine, and to check our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>What a ſclander is this? Doth the known certainty of our graces breed pride? Surely, did we challenge theſe graces for our own, there might be ſome fear of this vice; but whiles we yield them to be Gods, how can we be puff't up; what a madnes is it in a Man to be proud of anothers glory? It is a great word of the Apoſtle <hi>I can do all things,</hi> but when he adds, <hi>through him that ſtrengthens me,</hi> now, the praiſe is all Gods, and not his; now, he boaſts all of God, nothing of himſelf; No, preſumption is proud, but faith is humble. There can be no true faith without repentance; no repentance without ſelf-dejection. Yea, the very proper baſis of all grace whatſoever is humility; much more of faith; ſince a Man cannot ſo much as apprehend that he hath need of a Saviour, till he be vile in his own eyes, and loſt in his own conceit. Yea ſo farr is the known cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of grace from working pride, as that it is certain there can be no grace, where there is pride of grace; ſo as whiles <hi>Gregory</hi> can ſay <hi>Si ſcimus nos habere gratiam, ſuperbimus,</hi> If we know we have grace, we are proud; I ſhall by a contrary inverſion not fear to ſay; <hi>Si ſuperbimus, ſcimus nos non habere gratiam,</hi> If we be proud, we know we have no grace.</p>
                  <p>Sloth and ſecurity is the more probable vice; why may not the ſpirituall ſluggard ſay; If I be ſure of my calling and election, and Gods decree is unchangeable, what need I care for more? <hi>ſit down, ſoul, and take thine eaſe; ut quid perditio haec?</hi> To what purpoſe doſt thou macerate thy ſelf with the penall works of an auſtere morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication? what needeſt thou toile thy ſelf in the buſie labours of a conſtant devotion? what need theſe aſſiduous prayers, theſe frequent ſermonings, theſe importune communicatings? thou canſt be but ſure of thine election; thou art ſo already; ſit down now my ſoul, and take not thy eaſe only but thy pleaſure; let thy ſelf freely looſe to thoſe contentments, wherein others ſeek and
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:97700:162"/>
find felicity; Be happy here, ſince thou canſt not but be ſo here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>A Man might perhaps ſpeak thus, but can a believer ſay ſo? Whoſe faith quells the very thought of this pernicious ſecurity; and excites him more to a carefull indeavour of all good actions, then reward can the ambitious, or fear the cowardly? Lo this Man will be ſure to do ſo much more good, by how much he is more ſure of his election; and will be more afraid of ſin, then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is of hell; He well knows the inſeparable connexion betwixt the end, and the means, and cannot dream of obtaining the one, without the other; he knows that mortification of his corruptions, and the life and exerciſe of grace are the happy effects of his gracious and eternall election. If he look to his calling, he meets with that of the Apoſtle, <hi>We are called, not to uncleaneneſs, but to holineſs,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.7. <hi>If to his election; we are choſen that we might be holy, and without blame before him in love, Epheſ.</hi> 1.3. Both calling and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection call him to nothing but holineſs; and he will more buſie himſelf in the duties of piety, charity, juſtice, out of love, then a ſervile nature would out of conſtraint; and will do more good, becauſe he is elected, then a mercenary diſpoſition would do, that he might be elected; and will be more carefull to avoid ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he makes account of Heaven, then a ſlaviſh mind can, or will be that he may avoid hell; <hi>Ezekiah</hi> hath fifteen years promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be added to his life; he is ſure God cannot deceive him; what then? doth he ſay; though I take no ſuſtenance I ſhall live; let me take poyſon: let me run into fire or water, or upon the ſword of an enemy, fifteen years is my ſtint, which can no more be abridged, then prolonged; I will never trouble my ſelf with Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Drinking, I will ruſh fearleſly upon all dangers? none of theſe, he that knows he ſhall live, knows he muſt live by means; and therefore feeds moderately, demeans himſelf no leſſe carefully that he may live, then any other whoſe life is uncertain. It is for ignorant Turks to make ſo ill uſe of their predeſtination, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their deſtiny is written in their foreheads; they need not regard danger, but may ſecurely ſleep upon the pillow of him that died the day before of the plague: wiſemen know that divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is no exemption of our beſt care.</p>
                  <p>It cannot ſtand with a true favourite of Heaven to make ſo ill
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:97700:163"/>
uſe of Gods mercies, as to be evill, becauſe he is good; to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, becauſe he is bountifull and unchangeable; what remaines then? but that out of our duty to the command, out of our ſenſe of the advantage, out of our care to ſhun the danger of the neglect, we ſhould ſtir up our ſelves, by all means poſſible, to make our calling and election ſure. Away with our poor and petty cares wherewith our hearts are commonly taken up: One cares to make his houſe, or his coffers ſure with bolts and bars; another cares to make his mony ſure by good bonds and Counter-bonds; another his eſtate ſure to his poſterity by conveyances and Fines; Another his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture ſure by a wary pre-contract; Alas what ſorry worthleſs things are theſe in compariſon of eternity? And what a ſlippery ſecurity is that which our utmoſt indeavours can procure us in theſe tranſitory and unſatisfying matters? Oh our miſerable ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſs if whiles we are ſtudiouſly carefull for theſe baſe periſhing affaires, we continue willing unthrifts in the main and everlaſting proviſion for our ſouls!</p>
                  <p>Religion gives no countenance to ill-husbandry, be carefull to make your houſes ſure; but be more carefull to make ſure of your eternall manſions; be carefull for your earthly wealth, but be more carefull of the treaſures laid up in Heaven. Be carefull of your eſtate here, but be more carefull of that glorious patrimony above.</p>
                  <p>Briefly, be careful to live well here, be more careful to live hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily for ever.</p>
                  <p>Ye have ſeen that we may, and that we muſt indeavour to <hi>make ſure our calling and election:</hi> Our next work is to ſhew how and by what means they may, and muſt be indeavoured to be aſſured.</p>

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:97700:163"/>
is therefore but conjectural, becauſe it is of works; For the ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof, juſtly may we wonder to hear of a conjectural certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Certainly we may as well hear of a falſe-truth; what a plain implication is here of a palpable contradiction? Thoſe things which we conjecture at, are only probable, and there can be no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in probability. Away with theſe blinde peradventures; had our Apoſtle ſaid (and he knew how to ſpeak) gueſſe at your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and election by good works, his game here had been fair; but now when he ſaies: <hi>By good works indeavour to make your calling and election ſure,</hi> how clearly doth he diſclaim a dubious hit I-miſſe-I; and implies a fecible certainty. And indeed what hinders the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection of this aſſurance? Our works make good the truth of our faith, our faith makes good our effectual calling, our calling makes good our election, therefore even by good works we make our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection ſure. Neither can it hurt us, that the <hi>Cardinal</hi> ſaith we hold this certainty to be before our good works, not after them; and therefore that is not cauſed by our good works. We ſtand not nicely to diſtinguiſh how things ſtand in the order of nature; ſurely this certainty is both before, and after our works, before in the act of our faith; after in our works, confirming our faith; neither do we ſay this certainty is cauſed by our good works, but confirmed by them; neither doth this (<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>) good works muſt be taken in the largeſt latitude; ſo as to fetch in not only the outward good offices that fall from us in the way whether of our charity, juſtice or devotion, but the very inmoſt inclinations, and actions of the ſoul, tending towards God; our believing in him, our loving of him, our dreading of his infinite Majeſty; our mortification of our corrupt affections, our joy in the holy Ghoſt, &amp; whatſoever elſe may argue or make us holy: Theſe are the means by which we may, and muſt endeavor to make our calling &amp; election ſure. But to let this clauſe paſſe as litigious; the undoubted words of the text goe no leſs, <hi>If ye do theſe things ye ſhall never fall</hi>; (<gap reason="foreign">

Not to inſtance then, and urge thoſe many graces which are here ſpecified, I ſhall content my ſelf with thoſe three Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:97700:164"/>
vertues (ſingled out from the reſt) faith, hope, charity, for the makeing ſure our calling and election.</p>
                  <p>For faith, how clear is that of our Saviour, <hi>He that believes in him that ſent me, hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but hath paſſed from death to life; Joh.</hi> 5.24. <hi>This is the grace by which Chriſt dwels in our hearts, Epheſ.</hi> 3.17. and whereby we have communion with Chriſt, and an aſſured teſtimony of and from him; <hi>For he that believeth in the Son of God hath the witneſs in himſelf,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.10. And what witneſs is that? <hi>This is the record that God hath giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us eternall life, and this life is in his Son, verſe</hi> 11. <hi>He that hath the Son hath life, verſe.</hi> 12. See what a connection here is, Eternal life firſt: this life eternal is in and by Chriſt Jeſus; this Jeſus is ours by faith; This Faith witneſſeth to our ſouls our aſſurance of Life Eternall.</p>
                  <p>Our hope is next, which is an (<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>) a thruſting out of the head to look for the performing of that which our faith appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends; and this is ſo ſure a grace as that it is called by the name of that glory which it expecteth, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.5. <hi>For the hope ſake which is laid up for you in heaven,</hi> that is, for the glory we hope for: Now both faith and hope are of a cleanſing nature; both agree in this, <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying their hearts by faith, Act.</hi> 15.9. <hi>Every one that hath this hope purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf even as he is pure,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3. The Devil is an unclean Spirit, he foules whereſoever he comes, and all ſin is naſty, and beaſtly: Faith and hope (like as neat huſwives when they come into a foul and ſluttiſh houſe) cleanſe all the roomes of the ſoul; and make it a fit habitation for the Spirit of God. Are our hearts lifted up then in a comfortable expectation of the performance of Gods merciful promiſes? and are they together with our lives ſwept and cleanſed from the wonted corruptions of our nature, and polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our ſin? this is an undoubted evidence of our calling and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</p>
                  <p>Charity is the laſt which comprehends our love both to God and man, for from the reflection of Gods love to us, there ariſeth a love from us to God again: The beloved Diſciple can ſay, <hi>We love him becauſe he loved us firſt,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.19. And from both theſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulteth our love to our brethren, which is ſo full an evidence that our Apoſtle tells us, <hi>we know we are paſſed from death to life, becauſe we love the brethren,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14. For the love of the Father is inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:97700:164"/>
from the love of the Son; he that loves him that begets, loves him that is begotten of him.</p>

Look ſecondly into your own boſomes, open to none but your own eyes, If ye find there a true and lively faith in the Son of God, by whoſe blood ye are cleanſed from all your ſins; by vertue whereof ye can cry, <hi>Abba Father</hi>; a ſure hope in Chriſt purifying your ſouls from your corruptions, a true and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained love to your God and Saviour who hath done ſo much for your ſoules, ſo as you dare ſay, with that fervent Apoſtle, <hi>Lord thou knoweſt that I love thee,</hi> and in him, and for his ſake, a ſincere love to his children, as ſuch: Not as men, not as witty, wiſe, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, rich, bountiful, uſeful, but as Chriſtians ſhowing it ſelf in all real expreſſions: Theſe, theſe are excellent and irrefragable proofs, and evictions of your calling and election. Seek for theſe in your hearts and hands, and ſeek for them till ye finde them, and when ye have found them make much of them as the invaluable favours of God, and labour for a continual increaſe of them, and a growth in this heavenly aſſurance by them.</p>
                  <p>What need I urge any motives to ſtir up your Chriſtian care and diligence? Do but look firſt behinde you, ſee but how much pretious time we have already loſt? how have we loitered hitherto in our great work? <hi>Bernards</hi> queſtion is fit ſtill to be asked by us of our ſouls, <hi>Bernarde, ad quid veniſti</hi>? Wherefore are we here upon earth? To pamper our Gut? To tend our hide? To wallow in all voluptuous courſes? To ſcrape up the pelf of the World, As if the only end of our being were carnal pleaſure, wordly profit? Oh baſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy thoughts! What do we with reaſon if we be thus proſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? It is for beaſts, which have no ſoul, to be all for ſenſe. For us, that have ratiocination, and pretend grace, we know we are here but in a thorowfare to another world, and all the main task
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:97700:165"/>
we have to do here in this life, is to provide for a better; Oh then, let us recollect our ſelves at the laſt, and redeem the time; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-looking this vain and worthleſs World bend all our beſt indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to make ſure work for eternity.</p>
                  <p>Look ſecondly before you; and ſee the ſhortneſs, and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of this, which we call a life; what day is there that may not be our laſt? what hour is there that we can make account of as certain? And think how many Worlds the dying Man would give (in the late conſcience of a careleſs life) for but one day more to do his neglected work? and ſhall we wilfully be prodigall of this happy leaſure and liberty, and knowingly hazard ſo wofull, and irremediable a ſurpriſall.</p>
                  <p>Look thirdly below you; and ſee the horror of that dreadfull place of torment, which is the unavoydable portion of careleſs and unreclaimable ſinners; conſider the extremity, the eternity of thoſe tortures, which in vain the ſecure heart ſleightly hoped to avoid.</p>
                  <p>Look laſtly, above you, and ſee whether that Heaven (whoſe out-ſide we behold) be not worthy of our utmoſt ambition, of our moſt zealous, and effectuall endeavours;</p>
                  <p>Do we not think, there is pleaſure, and happineſs enough in that region of glory and bleſſedneſs, to make abundant amends for all our ſelf-combats, for all our tasks of dutyfull ſervice, for all our painfull exerciſes of mortification? Oh then, let us earneſtly, and unweariably aſpire thither, and think all the time loſt, that we imploy not in the endeavour of making ſure of that bleſſed and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall inheritance; To the full poſſeſſion whereof, he that hath purchaſed it for us by his moſt precious blood in his good time hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily bring us. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <head>A Plain and Familiar Explication OF CHRIST'S PRESENCE IN THE SACRAMENT OF HIS Body and Blood, Out of the Doctrine of the Church of ENGLAND. For the ſatisfying of a Scrupulous Friend. <hi>Anno</hi> 1631.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat Chriſt Jeſus our Lord is truly preſent, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the bleſſed Sacrament of his body and blood, is ſo clear and univerſally agreed upon, that he can be no Chriſtian that doubts it. But in what manner he is both preſent and received is a point that hath exerciſed many wits, and coſt many thouſand lives; and ſuch as ſome Orthodox Divines are wont to expreſs with a kind of ſcruple, as not daring to ſpeak out; For me, as I have learn'd to lay my hand on
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:97700:166"/>
my mouth where God and his Church have been ſilent, and to adore thoſe myſteries which I cannot comprehend, ſo I think it is poſſible we may wrong our ſelves in an over-cautious fear of delivering ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently-revealed truths; ſuch I take this to be which we have in hand; wherein as God hath not been ſparing to declare himſelf in his word, So the Church of <hi>England</hi> our dear Mother hath freely opened her ſelf in ſuch ſort as if ſhe meant to meet with the future ſcruples of an over-tender poſterity.</p>
                  <p>Certainly there can be but two wayes wherein he can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be preſent, and received; either corporally, or ſpiritually: That he ſhould be corporally preſent at once, in every part of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Euchariſtical Element through the World, is ſuch a Monſter of opinion as utterly overthrowes the truth of his humane body, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes the nature of a Sacrament, implies a world of contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, baffles right reaſon, tranſcends all faith, and in ſhort, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds Heaven and Earth; as we might eaſily ſhow in all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars if it were the drift of my diſcourſe to meddle with thoſe which profeſs themſelves not ours: who yet do no leſs then we cry down the groſs and Capernaitical expreſſion which their Pope <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> preſcribed to <hi>Berengarius</hi>; and cannot but confeſs that their own Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> adviſes this phraſe of Chriſts corporall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ſhould be very ſparingly, and warily taken up in the hearing of their people: but my intention only is to ſatisfie thoſe Sons of the Church, who, diſclaiming from all opinion of Tranſubſtantiation, do yet willingly imbrace a kind of irreſolution in this point, as hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſafeſt not to inquire into the manner of Chriſts preſence.</p>
                  <p>What ſhould be guilty of this nice doubtfulneſs I cannot conceive, unleſs it be a miſconſtruction of thoſe broad ſpeeches, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity (not ſuſpecting ſo unlikely commentaries) hath upon all occaſions been wont to let fall concerning theſe awful myſteries. For what thoſe Oracles of the Church have divinely ſpoken in reverence to the Sacramental union of the ſigne, and the thing ſignified in this ſacred buſineſs, hath been miſtaken, as literally and properly meant to be predicated of the outward Element: hence have grown thoſe dangerous errors, and that inexplicable confuſion which hath ſince infeſted the Church.</p>
                  <p>When all is ſaid, nothing can be more clear, then that in reſpect of bodily preſence the Heavens muſt contain the glorified humanity
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:97700:166"/>
of Chriſt untill his return to judgment. As therefore the Angel could ſay, to the devout <hi>Maries</hi> after Chriſts reſurrection ſeeking for him in his grave, <hi>He is riſen, he is not here</hi>; ſo they ſtill ſay to us ſeeking for his glorious body here below: <hi>He is aſcended, he is not here</hi>; It ſhould abſolutely loſe the nature of an humane body if it ſhould not be circumſcriptible.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.6.</note> Glorification doth not bereave it of the truth of being what it is. It is a true humane body, and therefore can no more according to the natural being even of a body glorified, be many wheres at once, then according to his perſonal being it can be ſeparated from that Godhead which is at once every where; Let it be therefore firmly ſetled in our ſouls as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted truth, That the humane body of Chriſt in reſpect of corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral preſence is in Heaven, whither he viſibly aſcended, and where he ſits on the right hand of the Father, and whence he ſhall come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with glory: a parcel of our Creed which the Church learn't of the Angels in Mount <hi>Olivet</hi>; who taught the gazing diſciples that this ſame Jeſus which was taken up from them into Heaven, ſhall ſo come in like manner as they ſaw him go into Heaven, which was with wonderfull glory and magnificence. Far be it from us then to think that the bleſſed humanity of the Son of God ſhould ſo diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage it ſelf, as where there is neither neceſſity nor uſe of a bodily deſcent to ſteale down, and conveigh himſelf inſenſibly from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Earth daily, and to hide up his whole ſacred body in an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand ſeveral pixes at once.</p>
                  <p>It is a wonder that ſuperſtition it ſelf is not aſhamed of ſo abſurd and impoſſible a fancy; which it is in vain for Men to think they can ſalve up with a pretence of omnipotence: we queſtion not the power of God, but his will: and do well know he cannot will ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute contradictions, <hi>Deus hoc potenter non potest,</hi> as one ſaid truly.</p>
                  <p>That which we ſay of Chriſts preſence, holds no leſs of his recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for ſo do we receive him into us, as he is preſent with us, neither can we corporally receive that which is bodily abſent: although be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the common incongruity of opinion, the corporal receiving of Chriſt hath in it a further prodigiouſneſs, and horrour: all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of the Roman Schools are now aſham'd of their Popes <hi>Dentibus teritur,</hi> but when their Doctors have made the beſt of their own Tenent, they cannot avoid St. <hi>Austins flagitium videtur praecipere</hi>; By how much the humane fleſh is and ought to be more dear, by ſo
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:97700:167"/>
much more odious is the thought of eating it, neither let them ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine they can eſcape the imputation of an hateful ſavageneſs in this act, for that it is not preſented to them in the form of fleſh, whiles they profeſſe to know it is ſo, howſoever it appeareth: Let ſome skilful cook ſo dreſs mans fleſh in the mixtures of his artificial haſhes, and taſt full ſauces, that it cannot be diſcerned by the ſence, yet if I ſhall afterwards underſtand that I have eaten it, though thus covert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conveyed, I cannot but abhorr to think of ſo unnatural a diet; Corporally then to eat (if it were poſſible) the fleſh of Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.63.</note> as it could (in our Saviours own word) profit nothing, ſo it could be no other then a kinde of religious Cannibaliſme, which both nature and grace cannot but juſtly riſe againſt.</p>
                  <p>Since therefore the body of Chriſt cannot be ſaid to be corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſent, or received by us, it muſt needs follow that there is no way of his preſence or receit in the Sacrament but ſpiritual, which the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath laboured ſo fully to expreſs both in her holy Liturgie, and publickly-authorized homilies, that there is no one point of divine truth which ſhe hath more punctually and plainly laid down before us: What can be more evident then that which ſhe hath ſaid in the ſecond exhortation before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion? thus,</p>
                  <p>Dearly beloved, foraſmuch as our duty is, to render to Almighty God our heavenly Father moſt hearty thanks, for that he hath given his Son our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, not only to dye for us, but alſo, to be our ſpiritual food and ſuſtenance, as it is declared unto us, as well by Gods word, as by the holy Sacraments of his bleſſed body and blood, &amp;c. Lo, Chriſt is in this Sacrament given to us, to be our ſpiritual food, in which regard alſo this ſacrament is in the ſame exhortation called a Godly and heavenly feaſt, whereto that we may come holy and clean, we muſt ſearch and examine our own conſciences (not our chops and mawes) that we may come and be received as worthy Partakers, of ſuch an Heavenly Table.</p>
                  <p>But that in the following exhortation is yet more pregnant, that we ſhould diligently try and examine our faith before we preſume to eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. For as the benefit is great if with a true penitent heart, and lively faith we receive that holy Sacrament, (for then we ſpiritually eat the fleſh of Chriſt,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:97700:167"/>
and drink his blood, then we dwel in Chriſt, and he in us, we be one with Chriſt, and Chriſt with us,) ſo is the danger great if we receive the ſame unworthily. What termes can be more expreſſe? it is bread and wine which we come to receive, that bread and that wine is ſacramental. It is our heart wherewith we receive that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, it is our faith whereby we worthily receive; this receit and manducation of the fleſh of Chriſt is ſpiritually done, and by this ſpiritual receit of him, we are made one with him, and he with us; by vertue, then, of the worthy receit of this ſacramental bread and wine we eat the fleſh and drink the blood of Chriſt ſpiritually; and there growes hereby a reciprocal union betwixt Chriſt and us, neither is he otherwiſe one with us, then we are one with him, which can be no otherwiſe then by the power of his inſtitution, and of our faith.</p>
                  <p>And that no man may doubt what the drift and purpoſe of our bleſſed Saviour was in the inſtitution and recommendation of this bleſſed ſacrament to his Church, it followes in that paſſage; And to the end that we ſhould alway remember the exceeding great love of our maſter and onely Saviour Jeſus Chriſt thus dying for us, and the innumerable benefits which by his pretious blood-ſhedding he hath obtained to us, he hath inſtituted and ordained holy myſteries as pledges of his love, and continual remembrances of his death to our great and endleſſe comfort: If therefore we ſhall look upon and take theſe ſacred elements as the pledges of our Saviours love to us, and remembrances of his death for us, we ſhall not need, neither indeed can we require by the judgment of our Church to ſet any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther value on them: But withall that we may not ſleightly conceive of thoſe myſteries, as if they had no further worth then they do out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ſhow, we are taught in that prayer which the Miniſter kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down at Gods board is appointed to make in the name of all the communi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ants before the conſecration, that whiles we do duly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thoſe bleſſed elements we do in the ſame act, by the power of our faith eat the fleſh, and drink the blood of Chriſt; ſo effectual and inſeparable is the ſacramental union of the ſignes thus inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our bleſſed Lord and Saviour, with the thing thereby ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; for thus is he preſcribed to pray; Grant us therefore gratious Lord ſo to eat the fleſh of thy dear Son Jeſus Chriſt, and to drink his blood that our ſinful bodies may be made clean by his body, and
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:97700:168"/>
our ſoules waſhed through his moſt pretious blood; and that we may ever dwell in him, and he in us.</p>
                  <p>Implying, that ſo doth our mouth and ſtomach receive the bread and wine as that in the mean time our ſouls receive the fleſh, and the blood of Chriſt; now the ſoul is not capable of receiving fleſh and blood but by the power of that grace of faith which appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates it: But that we may clearly apprehend how theſe Sacramental acts and objects are both diſtinguiſhed, and united, ſo as there may be no danger of either ſeparation or confuſion, that which followeth in the conſecratory prayer, is moſt evident: Hear us O merciful father we beſeech thee, and grant that we receiving theſe thy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of bread and wine, according to thy Son our Saviour Jeſus Chriſts holy inſtitution, in remembrance of his death and paſſion, may be partakers of his moſt bleſſed body and blood, who in the ſame night that he was betrayed, <hi>took bread, and when he had given thanks he brake it and gave it to his diſciples, ſaying; Take, eat, this is my body which is given for you, do this in remembrance of me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What more can be ſaid? what come we to receive outwardly? The Creatures of bread and wine? To what uſe? In remembrance of Chriſts death and paſſion? what do we the whiles receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly? we are thereby made partakers of his moſt bleſſed body and blood: by what means doth this come about? By virtue of our Saviours holy inſtitution: ſtill it is bread and wine in reſpect of the nature and eſſence of it, but ſo that in the ſpiritual uſe of it, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyes to the faithful receiver, the body and blood of Chriſt; bread and wine is offered to my eye and hand, &amp; Chriſt is tendred to my ſoul. Which yet is more fully (if poſſibly it may be) expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the form of words preſcribed in the delivery of the bread and wine to the communicant. The body of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt which was given for thee, preſerve thy body &amp; ſoul into everlaſting life, and take and eat this in remembrance that Chriſt dyed for thee, and feed on him in thine heart by faith with thanksgiving, &amp;c. No gloſs in the world can make the words more full and perſpicuous: So do we in remembrance of Chriſts death take and eat the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental bread with our mouths, as that our hearts do feed upon the body of Chriſt by our faith, And what is this feeding upon Chriſt? but a comfortable application of Chriſt and his benefits to our ſouls? Which is, as the prayer next following expreſſes it, Then do
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:97700:168"/>
we feed on Chriſt, when by the bleſſed merits and death of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, and through faith in his blood we do obtain remiſſion of our ſins, and all other benefits of his paſſion and are fulfilled with his grace, and heavenly benediction: Or if we deſire a more ample commentary upon this ſacramental repaſt, and the nouriſhment thereby received, the prayer enſuing offers it unto us in theſe words, We moſt heartily thank thee, for that thou haſt vouchſafed to feed us which have duely received theſe holy myſteries with the ſpiritual food of the moſt precious body and blood of thy Son our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and doſt aſſure us thereby of thy favour and goodneſs towards u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and that we be very members incorporate in thy myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body, which is the bleſſed company of all faithful people; and be alſo heirs through hope of thy everlaſting kingdome by the merits of the moſt precious death and paſſion of thy dear Son. This then is to feed upon Chriſt: Lo, the meat and manducation and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment are all ſpiritual, whiles the elements be bodily and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which the allowed homilies of the Church alſo have laboured in moſt ſignificant termes to ſet forth; Thou muſt carefully ſearch and know (ſaith the firſt ſermon concerning the ſacrament (<hi>Tome</hi> 2.) what dignities are provided for thy ſoul, whither thou art come, not to feed thy ſenſes and belly to corruption, but thy inward man to immortality and life, nor to conſider the earthly creatures which thou ſeeſt, but the heavenly graces which thy faith beholdeth; For this table is not, ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> for chattering jayes but for Eagles, who fly thither where the dead body lieth. And afterwards, to omit ſome other paſſages, moſt pregnantly thus; It is well known the meat we ſeek for in this ſupper is ſpiritual food, the nouriſhment of our ſoul, a Heavenly refection, and not earthly, an inviſible meat and not bodily, a ghoſtly ſubſtance and not carnal; ſo that to think without faith we may enjoy the eating &amp; drinking thereof, or that that is the fruition of it, is but to dream a groſs carnal feeding, baſely abjecting and binding our ſelves to the elements and creatures; whereas by the advice of the council of <hi>Nice</hi> we ought to lift up our minds by faith, and leaving theſe inferiour and earthly things, there ſeek it where the ſon of righteouſneſs ever ſhineth. Take this leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (O thou that art deſirous of this table) of <hi>Emiſſenus</hi> a godly father, That when thou goeſt to the reverend communion to be ſatisfyed with ſpiritual meats, thou look up with faith upon the holy body and blood
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:97700:169"/>
of thy God, thou marvel with reverence, thou touch it with the mind, thou receive it with the hand of thy heart, and thou take it fully with the inward Man. Thus that homily in the voice of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who now ſhall make doubt to ſay that in the Sacrament of the bleſſed Euchariſt, Chriſt is only preſent and received in a ſpiritual manner? ſo as nothing is objected to our ſenſes, but the Elements, nothing but Chriſt to our faith; and therefore that it is requiſite we ſhould here walk with a wary, and even foot as thoſe that muſt tread in the midſt betwixt profaneneſs, and ſuperſtition; not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixing a deity upon the Elements on the one ſide, nor on the other ſleighting them with a common regard; not adoring the Creatures, not baſely eſteeming their relation to that Son of God whom they do really exhibit to us. Let us not then think it any boldneſs either to inquire or to determine of the manner of Chriſts preſence in the Sacrament; and confidently to ſay, that his body is locally in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſpiritually offered to, and received by the faith of every worthy communicant upon Earth; True it is that in our Saviours ſpeech, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. to believe in Chriſt, is to eat his fleſh and to drink his blood, even beſides &amp; out of the act of this Euchariſtical ſupper; ſo as whoſoever brings Chriſt home to his ſoul by the act of his faith, makes a private meal of his Saviour; but the holy Sacrament ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradds a further degree of our intereſt in the participation of Chriſt; for now over and above our ſpiritual eating of him, we do here eat him Sacramentally alſo: every ſimple act of our faith feeds on Chriſt, but here by virtue of that neceſſary union which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours inſtitution hath made betwixt the ſigne and the thing ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the faithfull communicant doth partake of Chriſt in a more peculiar manner; now his very ſenſes help to nouriſh his ſoul, and by his eyes, his hands, his taſt, Chriſt is ſpiritually conveighed into his heart; to his unſpeakable and everlaſting conſolation.</p>
                  <p>But to put all ſcruples out of the mind of any reader concerning this point; Let that ſerve for the upſhot of all, which is expreſſely ſet down in the 5th. Rubrick in the end of the Communion ſet forth as the judgment of the Church of <hi>England</hi> both in King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, though lately upon negligence omitted in the impreſſion, In theſe words; Leaſt yet the ſame kneeling might be thought or taken otherwiſe, we do declare, That
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:97700:169"/>
it is not meant thereby that any adoration is done, or ought to be done either unto the ſacramental bread and wine there bodily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, or unto any real and eſſential preſence there being of Chriſts natural fleſh and blood; For as concerning the ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal bread and wine, they remain ſtill in their very natural ſubſtances, and therefore may not be adored; for that were Idolatry to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred of all faithfull Chriſtians; and as concerning the natural body and blood of our Saviour Chriſt they are in Heaven, and not here for it is againſt the truth of Chriſts natural body to be in more places then one, at one time, &amp;c. Thus the Church of <hi>England</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving plainly explicated her ſelf, hath left no place for any doubt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this truth; neither is ſhe any changeling in her judgment, however ſome unſteddy minds may vary in their conceits; away then with thoſe nice ſcruplers, who for ſome further ends have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to keep us in an undue ſuſpenſe, with a (<hi>non licet inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere de modo</hi>) and conclude we reſolutely that there is no truth in divinity more clear then this of Chriſts gracious exhibition, and our faithful reception of him in this bleſſed Sacrament.</p>

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:97700:170"/>
gloſſes of the law; <hi>Ye have heard that it was ſaid by them of old,</hi> thus, and thus, <hi>but I ſay unto you,</hi> &amp;c, as if the Son of God in checking the upſtart antiquity, of a miſ-grounded and unreaſonable tradition, meant to condemn the truely-antient and commendable cuſtomes of the whole Chriſtian Church; which all ſober and judicious chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are wont to look upon with meet reſpect and reverence: And certainly whoſoever ſhall have ſet down this reſolution with himſelf to ſleight thoſe either inſtitutions or practiſes which are derived to us from the Primitive times, and have ever ſince been intertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the whole church of Chriſt upon earth, that man hath laid a ſufficient foundation of Schiſme and dangerous ſingularity; and doth that which the moſt eminent of the Fathers, St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> chargeth with no leſs then moſt inſolent madneſſe. For me and my friend, God give us grace to take the advice which our Saviour gives to his ſpouſe, to <hi>Go forth by the footſteps of the Flock, and to feed our Kids beſide the Shepheards tents, (Cant.</hi> 1.8.) and to walk in the ſure paths of uncorrupt antiquity. For the celebration of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Feaſts of our Saviours Nativity, Reſurrection, Aſcention, and the comming down of the Holy Ghoſt, which you ſay is cryed down by your zealous lecturer one would think there ſhould be reaſon enough in thoſe wonderful and unſpeakable benefits which thoſe dayes ſerve to commemorate unto us; For, to inſtance in the late feaſt of the Nativity, when the Angel brought the newes of that bleſſed birth to the Jewiſh ſhepheards, <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I bring you good tidings of great joy which ſhall be to all people; for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you is borne this day a Saviour.</hi> If then the report of this bleſſing were the beſt tidings of the greateſt joy that ever was, or ever could be poſſibly incident into mankind, why ſhould not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration thereof be anſwerable? Where we conceive the greateſt joy, what ſhould hinder us to expreſſe it in a joyfull feſtivity.</p>
                  <p>But you are taught to ſay, the day conferred nothing to the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that every day we ſhould with equal thankfulneſſe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this ineſtimable benefit of the incarnation of the Son of God, ſo as a ſet anniverſary day is altogether needleſs; know then and conſider, that the all wiſe God, who knew it fit that his People ſhould everyday think of the great work of the creation, and of the miraculous deliverance out of the Egyptian ſervitude, and
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:97700:171"/>
ſhould daily give honour to the Almighty creator and deliverer, yet ordained one day of ſeven for the more ſpecial recognition of theſe marvellous works; as well knowing how apt we are to forget thoſe duties wherewith we are only encharged in common without the deſignment of a particular rememoration. Beſides, the ſame reaſon will hold proportionably againſt any monethly or annuall celebration whatſoever; the Jewes ſhould have been much to blame, if they had not every day thankfully remembred the great deliverance which God wrought for them from the bloody deſign of cruel <hi>Haman,</hi> yet it was thought requiſite (if not neceſſary) that there ſhould be two ſpecial dayes of <hi>Purim</hi> ſet apart for the anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary memorial of that wonderful preſervation: The like may be ſaid for the <hi>Engliſh Purim,</hi> of our <hi>November</hi>; it is well if, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the general tye of our thankfulneſs, a preciſe day ordaind by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority can enough quicken our unthankful dulneſs to give God his own for ſo great a mercy; ſhall we ſay now, it is the work of the year, what needs a day? As therefore no day ſhould paſſe over our head without a grateful acknowledgment of the great myſtery of God incarnate. So withall, the wiſdome of the primitive Church (no doubt by the direction of the holy Ghoſt) hath pitched upon one ſpecial day wherein we ſhould intirely devote our thoughts to the meditation of this work, which the Angels of heaven can not enough admire.</p>
                  <p>But you are told that perhaps we miſs of the day ſince the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is litigious, uncertain, unknown, and in likelyhood other then our <hi>December</hi>; and that it is purpoſely not revealed, that it may not be kept: As to the firſt, I deny not, that the juſt day is not certainly known: The great Saviour of the World that would have his ſecond coming without obſervation going before it; would have his firſt coming without obſervation following it; he meant to come down without noiſe without a recorded notice: Even in the ſecond hundred (ſo antient we are ſure this feſtivity is) there was queſtion, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent opinions of the ſeaſon; the juſt knowledg and determination whereof, matters nothing at all to the duty of our celebration: Moſt ſure we are that ſuch a day there was; and no leſſe ſure, that it was the happieſt day that ever lookt forth into the world; it is all one to us whether this day or that; we content our ſelves with this, that it hath pleaſed the Church for many hundred years to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:97700:171"/>
this day for the commemoration of that tranſcendent bleſſing; what care we to ſtand upon thoſe twelve hours that made up the artificial day wherein this wonderful work was wrought? which we are ſure cannot but be much changed by ſo many intercalations; ſo long and conſtant a practiſe of the chriſtian church, upon ſo holy grounds is no leſſe warrant to us then if an Angel from heaven ſhould have revealed unto us the juſt hour of this bleſſed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity</p>
                  <p>As to the ſecond, Surely whoſoever ſhall tell you that God did purpoſely hide this day from us, that it might eſcape a celebration, as he concealed the burial of <hi>Moſes</hi> to avoid the danger of an idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous adoration, makes himſelf a preſumptuous commenter upon the actions of the Almighty. Where did God tell him ſo? Or what revelation can he pretend for ſo bold an aſſertion? If this were the matter, why then did not the ſame God with equal caution conceal the day of the Paſſion, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion of our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and of the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt? the obſervation of all which dayes, is with no leſs vehemence and upon the ſame danger cryed down by theſe ſcrupulous perſons. Either therefore let him ſay that God would have theſe other feaſt dayes obſerved becauſe he would have them known to the world, or yield that he did not therefore conceal the day of the Nativity of Chriſt, becauſe he would not have it obſerved.</p>
                  <p>But you hear it ſaid, There is popery and ſuperſtition in keeping that day; tell thoſe that ſuggeſt ſo, that they caſt a foul ſlander up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Saints of God in the primitive times, upon the holy and learned fathers of the Church who preached, and wrote for, and kept the feaſt of Chriſts Nativity with ſacred ſolemnity, many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years before popery was hatched; and that they little know what wrong they do to religion and themſelves, and what honor they put upon that ſuperſtition which they profeſs to deteſt; in aſcribing that to popery which was the mere act of holy and devout Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>But to colour this plea, you are taught that the myſtery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity began early to work, even in the very Apoſtlick times, and that Antichriſt did ſecretly put in his claw, before his whole body appeared.</p>
                  <p>Surely there is ſingular uſe wont to be made of this ſhift by thoſe
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:97700:172"/>
which would avoid the countenance of all primitive authority to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſpleaſing (how ever lawfull and laudable) inſtitutions and practiſes; So the Anabaptiſt tells us that the Baptizing of children is one of the timely workings of the myſtery of iniquity; So the Blaſphemous <hi>Nearrians</hi> of our time tell us that the myſtery of the bleſſed Trinity of perſons in the unity of one Godhead is but an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient deviſe of Antichriſt working under-hand before his formal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition. Every ſect is apt to make this challenge; and therefore it behoves us wiſely to diſtinguiſh betwixt thoſe things which Men did as good Chriſtians, and thoſe which they did as ingaged to their own private or to the more common intereſt of others. what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage can we conceive it might be to Antichriſt, that Chriſt ſhould have a day celebrated to the memory of his bleſſed Birth; and that devout Chriſtians ſhould meet together in their holy aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies to praiſe God for the benefit of that happy incarnation? and what other effect could be expected from ſo religious a work, but glory to God, and edification to Men? who can ſuppoſe that the enemy of Chriſt ſhould gain by the honour done to Chriſt? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way therefore with this groundleſs imagination; and let us be ſo popiſh, ſo ſuperſtitious as thoſe holy Fathers, and Doctors of the primitive Church, famous for learning and piety, who lived and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed devout obſervers of this Chriſtian feſtival.</p>
                  <p>But you are bidden to ask what warrant we find in the word of God (which is to be the rule of all our actions) for the ſolemn keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this day? In anſwer, you may if you pleaſe tell that queſtioniſt, that to argue from Scripture negatively in things of this nature is ſomewhat untheological; Ask you him again with better reaſon, what Scripture he finds to forbid it? for if it be unlawfull to be done which is not in Gods word commanded, then much rather that which is not there forbidden cannot be unlawfull to be done; Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral grounds of edification, decency, expedience, peaceable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the injunctions of our ſpiritual governors are in theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes more then enough to build our practiſe upon. If it be replied that we are injoyned ſix daies to labour, and forbidden to obſerve dayes &amp; times, (as being a part of the Jewiſh paedagogue, two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon pretenſes wherewith the eyes of the ignorant are wont to be bleared) know that for the firſt, it is not ſo much preceptive as permiſſive; neither was it the intention of the Almighty to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſe
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:97700:172"/>
the command of humane affaires in the firſt Table of his royall law, wherein himſelf and his ſervice is immediately concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; In ſuch like expreſſions, <hi>maist,</hi> and, <hi>ſhalt</hi> are equivalent, and promiſcuouſly uſed; that inſtance is clear and pregnant <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.16. <hi>The Lord,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>commanded the Man, ſaying, Eating thou ſhalt eat of every tree in the Garden,</hi> which our laſt verſion renders well to the ſenſe, <hi>Thou maiſt freely eat of every tree in the Garden</hi>; And if the charge in that fourth commandement were abſolute and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory, what humane authority could diſpenſe with thoſe large ſhreds of time which are uſually cut out of the ſix dayes for ſacred occaſions? what warrant could we have to intermit our work for a dayly lecture, or a monthly faſt, or for an anniverſary Fifth of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi>? and if notwithſtanding this command of God, it be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be in the power of Man, whether Soveraine (as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> appropriated it) or ſpiritual, to ordain the ſetting a part of ſome ſet parcels of time to holy uſes, why ſhould it be ſtuck at in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring and obſerving the pious and uſefull celebrity of this feſtivall?</p>
                  <p>As for that other ſuggeſtion of the Apoſtles taxation of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving dayes and times, any one that hath but halfe an eye, may ſee that it hath reſpect to thoſe Judaicall holy-dayes which were part of the ceremonial law, now long ſince out of date; as being of typical ſignification, and, ſhadowes of things to come.</p>
                  <p>Should we therefore go about to revive thoſe Jewiſh feaſts, or did we erect any new day to an eſſentiall part of the worſhip of God, or place holineſs in it, as ſuch we ſhould juſtly incurr that blame which the Apoſtle caſts upon the <hi>Galatian,</hi> and <hi>Coloſſian</hi> falſe-teachers.</p>
                  <p>But to wreſt this forbiddance to a Chriſtian ſolemnity which is merely commemorative of a bleſſing received, without any prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration of things to come, without any opinion of holineſs annexed to the day is no other then an injurious violence.</p>
                  <p>Upon all this which hath been ſaid, and upon a ſerious weighing of what ever may be further alledged to the contrary, I dare confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently affirm that there is no juſt reaſon why good Chriſtians ſhould not with all godly cherefulneſs obſerve this, which that holy father ſtyled the metropolis of all feaſts; To which I add that thoſe which by their example and doctrine ſleight this day, cauſing their people

                     </note> too clear a proof of the ancient celebration of this feſtivall; It was under the Tyranny of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> &amp; his co-partner <hi>Maximinus,</hi> that twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Chriſtans, which were met to celebrate the feaſt of this bleſſed Nativity in the large Church of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> were made an <hi>Holocauſt,</hi> and burnt, together with that goodly Fabrick, to aſhes, on that day.</p>
                  <p>Lo, ſo great a multitude as twenty thouſand chriſtians, of all ages, of both ſexes, had not thus met together in a time of ſo mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal a danger, to celebrate this feaſt, if the holy zeal of their duty had not told them they ought to keep that day which theſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers teach us to contemn.</p>
                  <p>Now let theſe bold men ſee of how contrary a diſpoſition they are to theſe bleſſed Martyrs, which as this day ſent up their ſouls (like to <hi>Manoahs</hi> Angel) to heaven in thoſe flames.</p>
                  <p>After thus much ſaid; I ſhould be glad to know (ſince reaſon there can be none) what authority induces theſe gainſayers to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſo antient and received a cuſtome in the Church of God; you tell me of a double teſtimony cited to this purpoſe, the one of <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> the Hiſtorian; which I ſuppoſe is fetcht out of his 5th. book of Eccleſiaſtical ſtory, chap. 21. where, upon occaſion of the feaſt of Eaſter, he paſſeth his judgment upon the indifferent nature of all thoſe ancient feaſts which were of uſe in the primitive times; ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Apoſtles never meant to make any law for the keeping of feſtival dayes; nor impoſed any mulct upon the not keeping them, but left men to the free obſervation thereof.</p>
                  <p>For anſwer whereunto, I do not tell you that this author is wont to be impeached of Novatianiſme; and therefore may ſeem fit to yield patronage to ſuch a client; I rather ſay that (take him at the worſt) he is no enemy to our opinion, or practiſe; we agree with
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:97700:174"/>
him, that the Apoſtles would have men free from the ſervitude of the Jewiſh obſervation of dayes; that they enacted no law for ſet feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valls, but left perſons and places ſo to their liberty in theſe caſes, that none ſhould impoſe a neceſſity upon other; this were to be preſſed upon a <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who violently obtruded a day for the celebration of <hi>Eaſter</hi> upon all Churches (ſuppoſing in the mean while an <hi>Eaſter</hi> univerſally kept of all chriſtians, though not on the ſame day) this makes nothing againſt us, who place no holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the very hours, nor plead any Apoſtolical injunction for dayes, nor tye any perſon or Church to our ſtrict calender, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hold it fit out of our obedience to the lawes both of our church and kingdome, to continue a joyful celebration of a memorial day to the honour of our bleſſed Saviour.</p>
                  <p>But that other authority which you tell me was urged to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I confeſſe, doth not a little amaze me; it was, you ſay, of King <hi>James</hi> our learned Soveraigne of late and bleſſed Memory; whoſe teſtimony was brought in before the credulous people (not without the juſt applauſe of a <hi>Solomon</hi>-like wiſdome) as crying down theſe feſtivals, and in a certain ſpeech of his applauding the purity of the church of <hi>Scotland</hi> above that of <hi>Geneva</hi> for that it obſerved not the common feaſts of Chriſts Nativity, and Reſurrection, &amp;c. Is it poſſible that any mouth could name that wiſe and good King in ſuch a cauſe, whom all the world knowes to have been as zealous a patron of thoſe feſtivals, as any lived upon earth? and if he did let fall any ſuch ſpeech before he had any Downe upon his chin, &amp; whilſt he was under the ſerule, what candor is it to produce it now to the contradiction of his better experience, and ripeſt judgment? Nay, is it not famouſly known that it was one of the main errands of his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny into his native Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to reduce that church unto a conformity to the reſt of the Churches of Chriſtendom in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of theſe ſolemn dayes?<note place="margin">One of the five Articles of <hi>Perth.</hi>
                     </note> and to this purpoſe, was it not one of the main buſineſſes which he ſet on work in the Aſſembly at <hi>Perth,</hi> and wherein he employed the ſervice of his worthy Chaplain Doctor <hi>Young,</hi> Dean of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> to recall, and re-eſtabliſh theſe feſtivalls?</p>
                  <p>And accordingly, in purſuance of his Majeſties earneſt deſire this way, was it not enacted in that Aſſembly that the ſaid feaſts ſhould be duely kept? Doubtleſſe it was, and that not without much wiſe

care and holy caution; which act becauſe it cannot be had every where, and is well worthy of your notice, and that which clears the point in hand, I have thought good here to inſert: the tenor of it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is this.</p>
                  <p>As we abhorr the ſuperſtitious obſervation of Feſtival dayes by the Papiſts, and deteſt all licentious, and profane abuſe thereof by the common ſort of profeſſors; ſo we think that the ineſtimable benefits received from God, by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt his Birth, Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, and ſending down of the Holy Ghoſt, was commendably, and godly remembred at certain particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar dayes and times by the whole church of the World, and may be alſo now; Therefore the Aſſembly ordaines, that every Miniſter ſhall upon theſe dayes have the commemoration of the foreſaid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable benefits, and make choice of ſeveral and pertinent texts of Scripture, and frame their doctrine and exhortation there to, and rebuke all ſuperſtitious obſervation, and licentious profanation thereof.</p>
                  <p>I could (if it were needful) give you other proofes of King <hi>James</hi> his zeal for theſe dayes; but what ſhould I ſpend time in proving there is a ſun in the Heaven, and ſight in that Sun? The name of that great King ſuffereth for his exceſſe this way. Shortly then, the Church of God, his anointed, law, antiquity, reaſon are for us in this point, and I doubt not but you will gladly be on their ſide; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with all innovations and frivolous quarrels, we were divided e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough before, and little needed any new rents.

(my dear Brother) this is not an uſage for Kings, they are the nurſes of the Church; if the child ſhall fall to ſcratching and biting the breſt, what can it expect but ſtripes and hunger? your Letter profeſſes that his Majeſty ſent you away in peace, and joy, and why would any of thoſe rough-hewn Zelots ſend him away in diſcontentment? But this was (I know) much againſt your heart, whoſe often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations aſſured me of your wiſe moderation in theſe things. How earneſtly have you profeſſed to me, that, if you were in the Church of <hi>England</hi> (ſuch was your indifferency in theſe indifferent matters) you would make no ſcruple of your ceremonies? yea, how ſharp hath your cenſure been of thoſe refractaries amongſt us that would
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:97700:175"/>
forgo their ſtations, rather then yield to theſe harmeleſs impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? So much the more, therefore, do I marvell how any delator could get any ground from you, whereon to place an accuſation in this kind! But this, and the reſt of thoſe hiſtoricall paſſages, being only concerning things paſt, have their end in my notice; Let me rather turn my pen to that part which calleth for my adviſe, which, for your ſake, I could well wiſh, were worthy to be held ſuch, as that your ſelf and your collegues might find cauſe to reſt in it: howſoever, it ſhall be honeſt and hearty, and no other then I would, in the preſence of God, give to my own ſoul! Matters (you think) will not ſtand long at this point, but will come on further and preſs you to a reſolution! What is to be done? will you hear me counſelling as a friend, as a Brother? Since you foreſee this; meet them in the way, with a reſolution to intertain them and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade others. There are five points in queſtion: The ſolemn feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities: The private uſe of either Sacrament: Geniculation at the Euchariſt: Confirmation by Biſhops. For theſe, there may be a double Plea inſinuated (by way of compariſon) in your Letters; Expedience in the things themſelves; Authority in the commander: ſome things are therefore to be done; becauſe they are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: ſome others are therefore commanded; becauſe they are to be done: obedience pleads for the one, juſtice for the other; If I ſhall leave theſe in the firſt rank, I ſhall ſatisfie, but if in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond I ſhall ſupererogate; which if I do not, I ſhall fail of my hopes.</p>
                  <p>Let me profeſs to you ſeriouſly. I did never ſo buſily and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively ſtudy theſe rituall matters, as I have done ſince your Letters called me unto this task. Since which time (I ſpeak boldly) I made no ſpare either of hours, or papers, <hi>Neque enim magna exili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nec ſeria perfunctorie,</hi> as I have learned of our <hi>Nazianzen</hi>; and beſides, this, under one name, ſeemed a common cauſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore too worthy of my care.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are not (you know) matters of a day old, neither is it his Majeſties deſire, to trouble you with new coynes, but to rub up the ruſty and obliterate face of the ancient. And ſurely, the more my thoughts were bent upon them, the more it appeared to me, that his Majeſties intention is to deal with your Church, as he hath lately done with your Univerſities; From which, I know not
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:97700:176"/>
what indiſcreet and idle zeal had baniſhed all higher degrees; the name of a School-Doctor was grown out of date; only one Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duate (that I heard of) at St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> out-lived that injury of times: Now comes his Majeſty (as one born to the honor of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) and reſtores the Schooles to their former glories: This is no innovation (you will grant) but a renovation.</p>
                  <p>No other is that which his Majeſty wiſheth to your Church: For, tell me I beſeech you (my dear Mr. <hi>Struther</hi>) do not you think that thoſe which took upon them the reformation of your Church went ſomewhat too far? And (as it is in the fable) inwrapped the Stork together with the Cranes? I know your ingenuity ſuch, as you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny it: This you will grant apparently in the Church-patrimony (witneſs your own learned and zealous invective how miſerably ſpoyled) in the exauthoration of Epiſcopal office and dignity, in the demolition of Churches, and too many other of this ſtamp; ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent was that holy furor of piety: that hence it might well appear, what difference there is, betwixt the orderly proceedings of prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly authority, and popular tumult: And why ſhould you not yield me this in the buſineſs queſtioned?</p>
                  <p>Do but conſider how farr it is ſafe for a particular Church to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the antient and univerſal, and you cannot be leſs liberal: Surely no Chriſtian can think it a ſleight matter, what the church diffuſed through all times and places, hath either done or taught For doctrine or manners there is no queſtion, and why ſhould it be more ſafe to leave it in the holy inſtitutions that concerne the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward formes of Gods ſervice? Novelty is a thing full of envy and ſuſpicion, and why leſs in matters of rite then doctrine? The Church is the mother of us all, the leſs important thoſe things are which (in the power of a parent) ſhe injoynes, the more hateful is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trectation of our obſervance; you remember the queſtion of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians wiſe Servant; <hi>Father, if he had commanded thee ſome great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wouldſt thou not have done it?</hi> True it is, that every Nation hath her own rites, geſtures, cuſtomes, wherein it was ever as free for it to differ from the reſt of the World, as the world from it, yet in the mean time the ſacred affaires of God, have been ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to have one common faſhion of performance, in thoſe points eſpecially wherein hath been an univerſal agreement, every face hath his own favour, his own lines, diſtinct from all others, yet is
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:97700:176"/>
there a certain common habitude of countenance and diſpoſition of the forhead, eyes, cheeks, lips common unto all, ſo as who, under this pretenſe of difference, ſhall go about to raiſe an immunity from ſuch ceremonies, do no other then argue, That becauſe there is a diverſity of proportions of faces, we may well want a brow or a chin.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing that the pontificians do ſo commonly and with ſo much noiſe upbraid us with, as our diſceſſion from the mother church, that is, as they interpret, the Roman, neither is there any one amongſt all the loads of their reproaches that hath wrought us more envy then this. And how do we free our ſelves from the danger of this odious crimination, but thus (not to ſtand upon the imperious title of motherhood) That ſince for order ſake, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged this primacy of the Weſtern Church, we never departed one inch from the Roman, ſave where ſhe is perfidiouſly gone from God, and her ſelf? Now, the caſes queſtioned are for the moſt part only ſuch, as you will confeſs before the ſuſpicion of Antichriſtian Apoſtaſy to have obtained each where in the church. Begin if you pleaſe with the ſolemn feſtivities, turne over (I beſeech you) the hiſtories of times, and places; you ſhall never finde where theſe were either newly appointed, or not conſtantly and continuedly obſerved in the church of God. I confeſs with <hi>Socrates</hi> that neither Chriſt nor any Apoſtle enacted a law for theſe, but withall, I muſt put you in mind, that what he denies to conſtitution, he grants to cuſtome, and, <hi>obſervatio inveterata</hi> (that I may ſpeak with <hi>Tertullian) praeveniendo ſtatum facit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the ſolemn feaſt of Eaſter which the <hi>Ancyran</hi> counſel cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Diem magnum,</hi> how hotly the Church (even then in her ſwath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bands) contended about it, all the World knowes. I ſpeak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the friendly differences of <hi>Policarpus</hi> and <hi>Anacletus,</hi> nor of the Angel of <hi>Hermes</hi>; The Eaſt and Weſt were in this point fearfully divided; one part pleads a tradition from <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> the other from <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> both ſides fought long and ſore; at laſt the Roman Victor won the day, (<hi>poſtquam Aſiae Epiſcopos fulmine ſacro perculiſſet</hi>) Let <hi>Irenaeus</hi> deeply cenſure him as a furious diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the publick peace; I meddle with neither part: This ſtrife at laſt well laid, is after revived by the Syrian Divines? How ſtrongly doth the famous <hi>Nicene</hi> Council oppoſe it ſelf to theſe now <hi>Teſſerade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catites</hi>
                     <pb n="310" facs="tcp:97700:177"/>
(as thoſe times called them) yea what other cauſe was there (except the madneſſes of <hi>Arrius</hi> and his followers, the <hi>Meletians</hi> and <hi>Colluthians</hi>) of calling that venerable aſſembly together? after all this what diſcourſes paſſed betwixt <hi>Leo</hi> the firſt, Archbiſhop of <hi>Reme</hi> and <hi>Paſchaſinus Lylibetanus,</hi> were needleſs to rehearſe; and, how hot <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> was in this cauſe, need no other proof then, that, (as <hi>Socrates</hi> witneſſes) he took away the Churches from them which tyed Eaſter to the fourteenth Moon. Now, then, wherefore (I beſeech you) was all this <hi>Aſian</hi> conflict, wherefore this triumph of <hi>Victor,</hi> wherefore this infamous brand of the <hi>Quartadecimani</hi>?</p>
                  <p>Wherefore were thoſe paſchal Letters of the antient, or golden number, or the calculations of the Biſhops of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> or the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious determinations of the <hi>Nicene</hi> fathers, or the nice reckonings of <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Paſchaſinus,</hi> if this might have paſſed for lawfull, with one breath to deny the day, and with one daſh to blot it out of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Calender? certainly the antients knew not how to be thus witty, neither durſt they thus boldly cut that knot, in the untying whereof, perhaps, they overſpent their care and diligence. O ridiculous head of antiquity, if this ſhort courſe might have been ſafely held in thoſe former ages! Yea, tell me, I pray you, in all your readings, where ever you met with any man (beſides thoſe whom the Church hath held worthy the black marke of hereſy) who either denied all obſervations of this ſolemnity, or approved the refuſal of it by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? I can name you <hi>Aerius,</hi> a man blemiſhed with more then the ſcars of one hereſy; And what (ſaith he) is the Paſch, that you keep? you are again addicted to Jewiſh fables; we muſt keep no paſch, <hi>for Christ our paſch is offered for us,</hi> and I can ſhow you <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> flying in his face with this juſt reply, Who is likely to know more of theſe matters? this ſeduced wretch which is yet living in the World, or thoſe witneſſes which have been before us, and had the tradition of the Church with them, which received from their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that which, their fathers received from their forefathers, and ſtill retaines what they taught both for faith and tradition?</p>
                  <p>The ſame reaſon is there for the other feaſts. Unto this of the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter (that I may ſpeak in <hi>Leo</hi>'s words to the Biſhops of <hi>Sicily</hi>) is added the ſacred ſolemnity of Penticoſt in memory of the coming of the holy Ghoſt, which depends upon the time of the paſchal feaſt: Neither did <hi>Euſebius</hi> doubt to call this <hi>festivitatum omnium principem</hi>;
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:97700:177"/>You know how honourable mention is made of it by <hi>Gregory Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen,</hi>
                     <q>The Jew (ſaith he) keeps feaſt daies, but according to the letter; the Gentile keeps feaſt dayes, but according to the fleſh; we keep feaſt dayes alſo, but that we may ſay or do ſomething ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Spirit; and ſoon after, The Hebrews keep their Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoſt, and we keep it as we do ſome other Jewiſh rites, but they Typically, we Myſtically, we celebrate Penticoſt for the coming of the holy Ghoſt, as the day ſet for the performance of this promiſe and the fulfilling of our hope, and how great a myſtery is this, how ſacred.</q> —I cannot therefore paſſe over that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> of our Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turiſts which can ſay there is ſcarce any expreſſe mention of any of the feaſts in antiquity, beſides Eaſter; I may not admit all the bedroll that <hi>Polydore Virgill</hi> inſerts into the Apoſtolicall ſolemnities, I had rather hold the mid-way between both. That memorable place of <hi>Auſtin</hi> is to me in ſtead of a thouſand witneſſes, neither need we care for other evidence whileſt we have one ſo abſolute, you know where to find it, in the 118. Epiſtle to <hi>Januarius, Illa autem, quae non Scripta ſed tradita custodimus, quae quidem toto terrarum orbe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantur, dantur intelligi, vel ab ipſis Apostolis, vel plenariis conciliis (quorum eſt in Eccleſia ſaluberrima authoritas) commendata, atque sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuta retineri; ſicut quod domini paſſio, &amp; reſurrectio, &amp; aſcenſio in coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, &amp; adventus de coelo ſpiritus ſancti, anniverſaria ſolemnitate ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrantur, &amp; ſi quod aliud occurrerit; quod ſervatur ab univerſa, (qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque ſe diffundit) Eccleſia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if theſe feaſts could not ſhow ſo ancient and noble a pedigree, what hinders that the Church may not appoint certain dayes to the bleſſed memory of theſe excellent benefits? Doubtleſs, this right ſhe hath heretofore challenged to her ſelf in leſſer occaſions, and I do not finde any man that ever accuſed her of raſhneſs, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, how ſolemn the dayes of Purim were to the Jewes, is known to all, denyed of none, and their (<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:97700:178"/>
(next before <hi>Mardokees</hi> feaſt) to be kept anniverſarily ſacred unto the memory of that deliverance and victory: and what other do we in this happy Iſland, whiles we yearly celebrate thoſe two bleſſed dayes, to the miracle of the preſervation of our King, Church, State, with the joy both of love, and duty; then do the Streets of your <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgh</hi> ſmoke with many thankfull fires, and your Arthures-ſeat flames with the bon-fires of your triumph and exultation; and ſhall the dayes of Chriſt, wherein we were graciouſly delivered from the jawes of hell, carry from us leſs joy and celebrity: Surely your church ſhall abate nothing of her purity, in joyning her ſelf to all the reſt of the world, antient and moderne, in the obſervation of the feaſt of her Saviour.</p>
                  <p>As for the private adminiſtration of both the Sacraments; the difference of time, or place, cannot be of that value, as that for it, the participation of thoſe divine myſteries ſhould be neglected; there is a direct precept for either ſacrament, given by the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly author of both, and commended by the hands of the Apoſtles to the ſucceeding Church, there is no precept of time or place, and ſhall we omit that which Chriſt hath commanded, for that which he commanded not?</p>
                  <p>The holy myſteries are as the body, circumſtances are as the clothes, it were to be wiſhed that a goodly beautifull body, ſhould be fitly ſuted with clothes of due colours and faſhions, but if it ſhould fall out (through extremity of want) that there muſt be a meet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legancy lacking in the clothes, ſhall we therefore deſpiſe the body, and caſt it out for an unprofitable carcaſſe? If there did not a great neceſſity lie upon the ſacraments, if there did not much divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation flow from them, why would Chriſt leave them to his own ſpouſe the church as the precious pledges of his love? A neceſſity of the means no man can deny, the neceſſity of the end is not undeſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly litigious. Indeed God hath not bound himſelf to any means (good reaſon his omnipotency ſhould be free) but he hath thought good to bind us unto means; ſo as whoſoever ſhall wittingly and wilfully omit theſe ſaving inſtitutions, is juſtly guilty of the violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſo holy an ordinance, and withall of his own judgment. The dilation of the ſigne of that old covenant you know how hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy it lay upon holy <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the voluntary neglect of that other Sacrament (beyond the double day appointed) was wont (you
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:97700:178"/>
know to be puniſhed with no leſs then exciſion from the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and is there leſs neceſſity, leſs uſe of the Evangelical Sacraments?</p>
                  <p>To follow this inſtance a little further; tell me (I pray you) were not both thoſe antient Sacraments accuſtomed unto private roofs? Of the Paſchal diſh there can be no doubt, that holy feaſt was by the author of it deſtin'd to the private families of his Iſrael: perhaps you will ſtick a little at the other. I do not tell you of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Zipporah</hi>; look but upon the forerunner of Chriſt, you will finde it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that his circumciſion was within dores; his mother <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was either preſent, or not farr off at the ceremony (as it is moſt probable) ſhe changed his name, upon the act. Now it could not be, that the eighth day of her childbirth could alow her to go forth, whoſe uncleanneſs by the law pent her up for thirty dayes; But what do I urge this uncertainty? ſtill by the tradition of the Jewes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Synagogue, or the chamber, is indifferently allowed to this act. And why ſhould the Sacrament of the new law be ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to our Churches, that, not neceſſity it ſelf ſhould be able to fetch theſe wholſom remedies home to our houſes? ſure I am the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the ancient Church were of another mind; who (before the fancy of <hi>opus operatum</hi> was hatched) conceived ſuch neceſſity of the Sacraments, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> can tell you of <hi>Clinici,</hi> as well as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripateitci,</hi> that others in caſe of extremity would have no difference made of land, or water, houſe or way, bed or pavement. And how is it that our liberty hath made us more ſtrict, or our ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath made us more free? more ſtrict for the place, more free for the conceit of neceſſity.</p>
                  <p>But if privacy be ſo oppoſite to the nature of a Sacrament, why may it not be avoided, even in a parlour? for in ſuch a caſe, the Church removes thither, the walls (you think) conferr nothing, the people are by the order of the Church commanded to aſſemble in a due frequence to the honor of either ſacrament, ſo as now I ſee not other difference but this; Thoſe which, in the caſe of ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate faſt, can be content for their preaching to change the Church into a chamber, in the caſe of baptiſme, make dainty to change a chamber into a Church.</p>
                  <p>For geniculation in the Euchariſt, I am deceived if ever ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny could complain of a more unjuſt diſpleaſure, or plead better
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:97700:179"/>
deſert. For the Antiquity of it, thoſe that fetch it from <hi>Honorius,</hi> are ill heralds. They might know that <hi>Averroes</hi> (an age before him) could ſay (in a miſpriſion of the geſture) <hi>Chriſtiani adorant quod edunt</hi>; and the beſt of the Fathers many ages before him, <hi>Nemo manducat niſi prius adoraverit</hi>; For the expedience, what buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs can paſs betwixt Heaven and Earth, God and Man, ſo worthy of reverence, as that, wherein Man receives God; even the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt gifts, we receive from Princes upon our knees, and now, when the Prince of our peace gives himſelf to us, ſhall we grudg to bow. I know the old challenge, <hi>Artolatry.</hi> But ſhall others ſuperſtition make us unreverent? Shall not God have our knees, becauſe Idols have had the knees of others? But what do I preſs this to you, who profeſſed to me (if I remember well) your approbation hereof in our Engliſh Congregations: The Sacrament is every where the ſame; Nothing but want of uſe hath bred a conceit of uncouthneſs in that, which cuſtom would approve and commend.</p>
                  <p>As for confirmation by Biſhops; I need to ſay little, becauſe it little concerns you, as an action appropriate to ſuperiors; neither (I think) do you envy it to them. That the ceremony it ſelt is both of ancient and excellent uſe, I know you will not deny; for the one, <hi>Melancton</hi> gives it the praiſe of, <hi>Utilis ad erudiendos homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; retinendos in vera agnitione Dei.</hi> For the other, <hi>Zuinglius</hi> can aſſure you, <hi>Confirmationem tum fumpſiſſe exordium, eum vulgo caeptum eſt infantes tingi.</hi> In regard of both, reverend <hi>Calvin</hi> wiſheth it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain reſtored to the Church, with no ſmall fervency: all the doubt is in the reſtriction to Biſhops, wherein I will only ſend you to learned <hi>Bucer; ſignum impoſitionis manuum, etiam ſoli epiſcopi praebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant, &amp; non abſque ratione, ſive enim ſit foedus Domini baptizatis confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandum; ſive reconciliandi qui gravius peccaverunt, ſive eccleſiis mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtri ordinandi, haec omnia miniſteria maxime decent eos, quibus eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum cura demandata est</hi>! This, as it was done only at firſt, by the Apoſtles, in the caſe of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> ſo from them was by the Church derived to the Biſhops, as <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> directs, <hi>praepoſitis ſuis,</hi> as <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeak; But what need I cite Fathers, or counſels for that, which worthy <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf both confeſſes, and teaches; Certainly nothing but continuance and abuſe hath diſtaſted theſe things, which (if time had been their friend) never wanted that which might procure them grace and reſpect from the World.</p>

                     <pb n="315" facs="tcp:97700:179"/>For their own ſakes therefore, I need not doubt to ſay, that all theſe are worthy of your good intertainment; much more then, when they come to you with the billets of authority in their hands; were they but things in the loweſt ranke of indifferency, the power that commands them, might challenge their welcom, how much more then when they have an intrinſecall worthineſs to ſpeak for them? Your Letter hath well inſinuated what the power of Princes is, in things of middle natures; whereof your Apoſtles rule will eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hold, not for fear, but for conſcience. Indeed, wherein is the power of royall authority, if not in theſe things? Good and evill have their ſet limits, determined by God himſelf, only indifferent things have a latitude allowed for the exerciſe of humane com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, which if it might be reſiſted at pleaſure, what could follow but an utter confuſion of all things?</p>

by the multitude of ſeveral and ſelect congregations: Every of which, have both their abettors, and their adverſaries; The firſt hath all times, and places, ſince the dayes of the bleſſed Apoſtles, till this age, to ſtand for it; The ſecond hath the late perſecuted, reformed Church of <hi>France,</hi> (which never deſired, or meant to make their neceſſitated forme, a patterne for others) the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> for precedents of it; The third hath the Miniſters of <hi>New-England,</hi> and their Aſſociates, commonly ſtyled by the name of INDEPENDENTS, vehemently contending for it: The adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of every of theſe are as well known, as their friends; and the pleas, which every of them makes for it ſelf, are as well known as either.</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe it is yet <hi>res integra</hi>; elſe, I ſhould lay my finger upon my lips; Both the Houſes of Parliament, your Aſſembly, and the whole Kingdome, ſtand yet free, and unengaged to any part: For the National Covenant (as it is interpreted by ſome of your ſelves, and thoſe other Divines whoſe allowed Sermons have commented upon it) intends not to abjure, and diſclaime Epiſcopacie, as ſuch; but only bends againſt the whole preſent fabrick of Government, as it is built on theſe Arches, theſe Pedeſtals; ſo as if it be taken aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from thoſe (ſome of them, not neceſſary) appendances, you are no way forſtalled in your judgement againſt it; nor any other, that hath lift up his hand in this ſolemn Covenant.</p>
                  <p>That I may not urge the Latine Tranſlation of the ſame Covenant, printed and ſent abroad to the Low-Countries and <hi>France,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches, which ran only upon <hi>tyrannicum regimen Epiſcoporum</hi>; that onely the Tyrannical Government of the prelates, not their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly and brotherly preeminence, is there abjured.</p>
                  <p>Your wiſdomes know well how to diſtinguiſh betwixt a Calling, and the abuſes of the execution thereof; betwixt the main ſubſtance of a Calling, and the circumſtantial and ſeparable appurtenances thereunto; from which it may be deveſted, and yet ſtand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould be a flatterer of the times paſt (which is not often ſeen) if I ſhould take upon me to juſtifie, or approve of all the carriages of ſome that have been entruſted with the keyes of Eccleſiaſtical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: or to blanch over the Corruptions of Conſiſtorial Officers, in both theſe, there was fault enough, to ground both a complaint,

and Reformation; and, may that man never proſper, that deſires not an happy Reformation of what ever hath been, or is amiſs in the Church of God; but this I offer to your ſerious conſideration, whether Epiſcopacie, ſtripped of all circumſtances that may be juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepted againſt, and reduced to the Primitive eſtate, may not be thought a forme, both better in it ſelf, and more fit for this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Church, then either of the other.</p>
                  <p>How ancient it is, I need not appeal to any but your ſelves, who do well know, that there was never yet any Hiſtory of the Church, wherein there was not full mention made of Biſhops, as the only Governers thereof; neither can any learned adverſary deny, that they have continued, with the general allowance of Gods Church from the very Apoſtolick times, untill this preſent age. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it can be ſafe, and, lye not open to much ſcandal, to exchange ſo ancient an inſtitution hitherto perpetuated to the Church, for a new, where no neceſſity inforces us, judge ye.</p>
                  <p>How univerſal it is, being the only received government of all the Chriſtian Churches over the face of the whole earth, (excepting onely this ſmall ſpot of our neighbourhood) ye know as well, as the undoubted relation of the <hi>Chriſtianographie</hi> can tell you: and how unſafe it may be, to depart from the forme of all the Churches, that profeſſe the name of Chriſt, (who do all ſubmit themſelves to Biſhops, or Superintendents, except the fore-excepted) I leave to your grave judgment.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, how Epiſcopacie is, and hath long been ſetled in this Kingdome, and (as it were) incorporated into it; and enwoven into the municipal Lawes of this Land, ſo as that it cannot be utterly removed, without much alteration in the whole body of our Lawes; is a matter well worthy of not the leaſt conſideration.</p>
                  <p>But, all theſe would yet ſeem light upon the Balance, if there were not an intrinſecal worth in the inſtitution it ſelf, that might ſway with you: The covenant bindes to the indeavours of ſuch a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as is according to the Word of God, and the example of the beſt Reformed Churches. And now, let me appeal to your own hearts, and the hearts of all judicious and unprejudicated Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, whether the rules of Church Government, laid forth in the Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> do not ſuppoſe, and import that very proper jurisdiction, which is claimed by Epiſcopacy at this Day:
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:97700:191"/>
Which, if it were not intended to be left as a perfect patterne to ſucceſſion; the whole Church of Chriſt ſhould have been left in the dark, without any direction for the ſucceding adminiſtration thereof: Thoſe charges are plainly given, not to many, but to one; and do moſt manifeſtly imply, not a party, but preeminence and power.</p>
                  <p>And if the example of the beſt Churches muſt carry it: What Church could be more pure, and more fit for our imitation, then the Primitive? And that part of it which immediately followed the Apoſtles of our bleſſed Saviour Jeſus Chriſt? And do not you full well know, that our Hiſtories, and unqueſtionable Authors name the men, whom thoſe Apoſtles, by impoſition of hands, ordained to this function? Do not <hi>Ignatius, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Polycrates, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſippus, Clemens, Euſebius, Jerome</hi> inſtance in thoſe perſons, who ſucceeded each other in thoſe firſt Sees? If you tell me of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the Epiſcopacie of thoſe firſt Ages of the Church, and that of the preſent times; I doe willingly yield it, but, withall, I muſt add, that it is not in any thing eſſentiall to the calling, but in matters outward, and meerly adventitious; the abatement whereof (if it ſhould be found needful) diminiſheth nothing from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of that holy inſtitution; What can be more expreſſe, then, in the ancienteſt of them, the Bleſſed Martyr, <hi>Ignatius,</hi> the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the three diſtinct degrees of Biſhops, Presbyters, Deacons; encharged with their ſeveral duties which were yet never intermitted and let fall to this preſent day; How frequently, and vehemently doth he in his genuine Epiſtles (twice in that to the <hi>Epheſians</hi>) call for due ſubjection to the Biſhops and the Presbyterie? How diſtinctly doth he in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Magneſians,</hi> name their Biſhop, <hi>Dama</hi>; their Presbyters, <hi>Baſſus, Appollonius, Stephanus?</hi> How doth he in his Epiſtle <hi>Ad Trallianos</hi> ſet forth the Biſhop <gap reason="foreign">

Chriſt, but alſo was by the Apoſtles conſtituted in <hi>Aſia,</hi> Biſhop of the Church of <hi>Smyrna.</hi> Let him, if he can, deny <hi>Cyprian</hi> the holy Martyr and Biſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> writing familiarly to the Presbyters, and Deacons there; ſometimes gravely reproving them; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fatherly admoniſhing them of their duties; in divers of his Epiſtles. Let him deny, that his contemporany <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> acknowledgeth 46. Presbyters committed by the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church, to his charge: Shortly, let him, if he ſtick at this truth, deny that there was any Chriſtian Church of old, any Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</p>
                  <p>All which duly conſidered, I would fain know what reaſon can be ſhewed, why that ancient, yea firſt government by the Biſhop and his Presbytery, received, and with all good approbation and ſucceſſe, uſed in the Primitive Church, and derived (though not without ſome faulty omiſſions, and intertextures, which may eaſily be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died) untill this preſent day, ſhould not rather take place; then a government lately, and occaſionally raiſed up in the Church, for the neceſſity, or convenience of ſome ſpecial places, and perſons; without any intention of an univerſal rule and preſcription.</p>
                  <p>If you ſhall ſay that this Government by Biſhops hath been found, by ſad experience, hitherto, a block in the way of perfect Reformation, deſtructive to the power of Godlineſs, and pure Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Ordinances of Chriſt; give me leave to anſwer; That, firſt, I fear, the Independent part, will be apt to ſay no leſs of the Presbyterian; boldly preſſing their defects, both in conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and practiſe; and publiquely averring, the exquiſitely-reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed way to lye betwixt the <hi>Epiſcopal,</hi> and <hi>Calvinian,</hi> which they have had the happineſs to light upon; neither want there thoſe, who, upon challenge of further illumination, tax thoſe Semi-ſeparatiſts, as comming far too ſhort of that perfection of Reformation, which themſelves have attained.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I muſt, in the fear of God, beſeech you here to make uſe of that neceſſary diſtinction, betwixt Callings, and Perſons; for it oftentimes falls out, that the Calling unjuſtly ſuffers for that, whereof only the Perſon is guilty; Let the Calling be never ſo holy, and the rules of Adminiſtration never ſo wiſe, and perfect; yet if the perſon, in whoſe truſt they are, be either negligent, or corrupt, or impotent in ordering his paſſions and carriage, it cannot be but
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:97700:192"/>
all things muſt go amiſs, and much diſorder and confuſion muſt needs follow to the Church of God; and if ſuch hath been the caſe in ſome late times, why ſhould the blame be laid upon the calling, which both is innocent, and might have been better improved? Give me a Biſhop (ſuch there have been, and ſuch there are, let D. <hi>Potter</hi> the late Biſhop of <hi>Carlile,</hi> for inſtance, be one) that is truely conſcionable, pious, painful, zealous in promoting the glory of God, ready to encourage all faithful Preachers, and to cenſure and correct the lazie, and ſcandalous; carefull of the due impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his hands; meek and unblameable in all his carriage; and now tell me how the government of ſuch an one (regulated by the holy and wholſome Lawes of our Church) can be ſaid to be obſtructive to the ſucceſſe of the Goſpel, or to deſtroy the power of Godlineſs? certainly; if all be not ſuch, the fault is in the men; their Calling doth not only admit of, but incites them to all vertue and goodneſs; whereof if they be defective, let the Perſon take off the blame from the Function.</p>
                  <p>Neither doubt I to affirme, that it may well be made good, that the perfecteſt Reformation, which the Church of God can be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, here upon earth, may conſiſt with Epiſcopacy, ſo regulated, as it may be, if it pleaſe the High Court of Parliament to pitch upon that courſe: And indeed how can it be conceived, that the careful inſpection of one conſtant, prudent, and vigilant overſeer, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added to a grave and judicious Presbytery, ſhould be any hindrance to the progreſs of godlineſs? Eſpecially, when he is ſo limited by the bounds of good lawes and conſtitutions, that he cannot run out, without the danger of a juſt cenſure; There are already many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent rules of Government, if they were awaked, and actuated by full authority; and, where there is any deficiency, more might be eaſily added to make the body of Church-Lawes complete.</p>
                  <p>To give a taſt of what may be effected, with very little or no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of one Forme of Government to another.</p>

                     <hi>Any Queſtion of doubt being propoſed, is either decided by that meeting, or (if it cannot be ſo done) is, with charge of ſilence, reſerved till the National Synod, or Generall Aſſembly; which they hold every year once: Whither come not the Paſtors onely, but the King himſelf, or his Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners; and ſome of all Orders and Degrees, ſufficiently authorized for the determining of any controverſie, that ſhall ariſe amongſt them.</hi> Thus he. And certainly this bears the face of a very fair and laudable courſe, and ſuch, as deſerves the approbation of all the wel-willers to that diſcipline: But let me adde, that we either have, or may have, (in this very ſame ſtate of things, with ſome ſmall variation) in effect, the ſame Government with us; only there wants ſome care and life in their execution, which might, without much difficulty, be redreſſed; Every Pariſh hath, or by Law ought to have their Miniſter ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with them; and carefully watching over them. Inſtead then of their Paſtor, Elders and Deacons; we have in every Pariſh, the Miniſter, whether a Rector, or Vicar; Churchwardens, Queſtmen, or Sidemen, and Overſeers for the Poor; and in places of any emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, a Curate or Aſſiſtent to the Rector, who is a Deacon at

                  <p>In ſtead of their Presbyteries, conſiſting of ſeveral Paſtors, we have our number, and combination of Miniſters, in the Diviſions of our ſeveral Deanries; under which are ranged all the Miniſters within that circuit; Over whom the Rural Dean (as he is called) is every year choſen, by the ſaid Miniſters of that diviſion, as their moderator, for the year enſuing; whoſe office (if it were carefully looked unto, and reduced to the original inſtitution) might be of ſingular uſe to Gods Church; This Deanry, or Presbytery, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of ſeveral Paſtors, may be injoyned to meet together every moneth, or oftner (if it ſeem fit) in ſome City or Town next unto them; and may there have their exerciſe of propheſying, as I have known it practiced in ſome parts of this kingdom; and as it is earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſhed and recommended, by that excellently-Learned Lord <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulame,</hi> late Lord Chancelour of <hi>England,</hi> in his prudent conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and then, and there, may endeavour to decide any doubt, that may ariſe in their ſeveral Pariſhes; either concerning the doctrine of their Miniſter, or ſcruple in caſes of conſcience, and may tranſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For matter of ordination of Miniſters; the former conſtitutions
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:97700:194"/>
of our Church have deeply enjoyned the preſence, and aſſiſtance of thoſe, who, by their original inſtitutions, are the Presbytery of the Biſhop, at, and in, the examination, and allowance of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be ordained; requiring alſo, the joint-impoſition of thoſe hands, which atteſted the ſufficiency of the ſaid Examinants; not without a ſevere ſanction of two years ſuſpenſion, of the act of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining, to paſſe upon any Biſhop, or Suffragan, that ſhall be found failing in any of the particulars; the qualification of thoſe that are to be ordained, is in our Canons already ſet forth, with much cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for their age, their degrees, their abilities, the teſtimony of their holy converſation; neither need I doubt to affirm, that he, who (beſides all other circumſtances of Education) is able to give a good account of his faith in Latine, according to the received Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to confirme the ſame by ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent teſtimonies, out of the holy Scripture, may be thought compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently fit, (for matter of knowledg) to enter upon the firſt ſtep of Deaconſhip; which the wiſdome of the Church hath (according to the Apoſtles rule) appointed (not without a ſufficient diſtance of time) in way of probation, to the higher order of Miniſtery; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding to give both orders at once; and requiring, that he, who is ordained Deacon, ſhall continue a whole year, at leaſt in that ſtation, except, upon ſome weighty reaſons, it ſhall ſeem fit to the Biſhop, to contract the time limited: and, leſt there ſhould be any ſubreption in this ſacred buſineſs, it is Ordered, that theſe Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould be no other then ſolemn, both in reſpect of time &amp; place; neither ought they to be, nor in ſome places are, without a publick precognization of lawful warning affixed upon the Cathedral Church door, where the ſaid Ordination ſhall be celebrated; and over and beſides the charge, that none ſhall be admitted to be a Candidate of holy Orders, but he who brings ſufficient teſtimonials of his good life and converſation, under the ſeal of ſome Colledg in <hi>Cambridge</hi> or <hi>Oxford,</hi> or of three, or four grave Miniſters, together with the ſubſcription and teſtimony of other credible perſons, who have known his life &amp; behaviour, by the ſpace of three years next before; it is well known to you, that before the act of ordination there is publique Proclamation made to the whole Aſſembly, that if any man knowes any crime or impediment in any of the perſons preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for which he ought not to be ordained, that he ſhould come
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:97700:194"/>
forth and declare it before any hand be laid upon his head, for his full admiſſion.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding all which care of our dear Mother the Church of England; if it ſhall be thought meet, that any further act of Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, ſhall paſs upon thoſe, which are ſuitors for Ordination, how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily may it be ordered, that at the monethly (or, if need be, more frequent) meeting of the Miniſters, within the ſame Presbytery, or Deanry; they may be appointed to make tryal of their gifts, and undergoe ſuch further examination of their abilities, as ſhall be thought requiſite, ere they ſhall be preſented, and admitted by the Biſhop, and his Presbytery to that holy ſunction.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it is much ſtood upon, that it is meet the people, (whoſe ſouls muſt have right in him, to whoſe truſt they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted) ſhould have ſome hand in their conſent to that Paſtor, by whom they muſt be fed; it muſt be ſaid, that beſides their devolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their right to the patron, who, as their truſtee, preſents a Miniſter for them, it may be no prejudice at all to the power which by Law and inheritance is ſetled upon the patron, that the perſon whom his choiſe pitches upon, be appointed beforehand to preach, (for a trial) to that Congregation to which he is ſo deſigned; and if either for his voice, or other juſt exceptions he be found unmeet for them, that another, more fit may be recommended by the ſaid Patron to the place; but if through faction, or ſelf-will, or partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the multitude ſhall prove peeviſh, and faſtidious, they may, in ſuch a caſe, be over-ruled by juſt authority.</p>
                  <p>As for matter of cenſures, it may not be denyed, that there hath been great abuſe in the managing of them, both upon Eccleſiaſtical perſons, and others: ſuſpenſion of Miniſters upon ſlight, and inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſes, both <hi>ab officio,</hi> and <hi>beneficio,</hi> hath been too rife in ſome places of latter times; and the dreadful ſentence of excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath too frequently, and familiary paſſed upon light and triviall matters: How happy were it, if a ſpeedy courſe may be taken, for the prevention of this evil; In the conference at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> a motion was ſtrongly made to this purpoſe, but without effect; if the wiſdom of the preſent Parliament ſhall ſettle ſome other way for the curbing of contumacious offences againſt Church-authority, it will be an act worthy of their care and juſtice. In the mean time, as for this, and all other Eccleſiaſtical proceedings, it may
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:97700:195"/>
with much facility, and willing conſent of all parts, be ordered, that the Biſhop ſhall not take upon him, to inflict either this, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther important cenſure, without the concurrence of his Presbytery; which ſhall be a means (in all likelyhood) to prevent any inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience that may ariſe from the wonted way of Judicature.</p>
                  <p>As for the co-aſſeſſion of a Lay-presbytery, in ſwaying theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of Church-government; Ye well know how new it is; ſome of you might have been acquainted with the man that brought it firſt into any part of this Iſland; and what ground there is for it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Scripture, or antiquity, I appeall to your judgment: Surely the late learned Author of the Counſail for the reforming the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (although otherwiſe a vehement aſſertor of the French Diſcipline) ingenuouſly confeſſeth, that however thoſe Proteſtants which live under Popiſh Governours, have done wiſely, in deputing ſome choiſe men, ſelected out of their congregations, whom they call Elders, to ſhare with their paſtors, in the care and management of Eccleſiaſticall affairs; Yet thoſe Proteſtant Churches which live under the government of Proteſtant Princes, may with the ſafty of thoſe reſpects, which mutually intercede betwixt Paſtors and People, forbear any ſuch deputation: for as much, as the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Magiſtrate, transferrs (for the moſt part) to himſelf, that which is the wonted charge of thoſe deputed Elders; concluding, that thoſe men, do meerly loſe their labour who ſo buſily indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour on the one ſide, to diſprove the antiquity of the Lay-Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and, on the other, by weak proofes to maintain, (clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the mind of the Apoſtle) that the text of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17.) is to be underſtood of Paſtors, and Lay-Elders; Thus he; with what fair probability, I leave to your judgment.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it any intention of mine to meddle with any piece of that government, which obtaineth in other the Churches of God; but onely, to contribute my poor opinion, concerning the now-to-be-ſetled affairs of our own.</p>
                  <p>What ſhall I need to ſuggeſt unto you the dangerous under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workings of other Sects? ſecretly indevouring to ſpring their hidden mines to the overthrow both of the one government, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; whereof, without ſpeedy remedy, perhaps it will be too late to complain; no doubt, the wiſdom, and authority of that great Senate (whom ye alſo ſerve to adviſe) will forthwith inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:97700:195"/>
it ſelf to the prevention of thoſe miſchiefs, which the variety of theſe hereſies, and ſects (though ſome of them cloaked with the faireſt pretences) threaten to this poor Church: It is no boot for me to tell you, that the leſs diſunion there is, the more ground of ſafety; and that where the holy purpoſes of Reformation may be effected, with the leaſt change, there muſt needs be the moſt hope of accordance.</p>
                  <p>The reſt to the wiſe application of the powerfull and judicious; It is enough for me to have thus boldly ſhot my bolt amongſt you; and to have thus freely diſcovered my honeſt, and wel meant thoughts to ſo able judgments; What I want in my poor indevours ſhall be ſupplyed with my prayers, that God would be pleaſed to compoſe all our miſerable diſtractions, and to put an happy iſſue, to the long and perilous agitations of this wofully tottering and bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church and Kingdome; Which the good God of Heaven vouchſafe to grant for his great mercies ſake, and for the ſake of the dear Son of his love Jeſus Chriſt, the Juſt. <hi>Amen</hi>

                  <p>Theſe are the Articles of accord, which whoſoever holdeth and reſteth in, my ſoul betwixt him, and his harmes in the ignorance of further particulars. Let there be a thouſand parcells, and Atomes of truth contained in theſe heads, there needs no more be known, perhaps not all theſe, let there be no fewer errours in miſholding thoſe other manifold ſhreds of opinion, yet theſe are no rubs in our way to Heaven: And if now having conſented in theſe chief ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties, we will needs fall out about immateriall inferences, we are like to quarrelous brethren, who having agreed upon the main di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of their inheritance, fall out about ſome heaps of rubbiſh.

That crafty Devill, that envyes our peace, takes this perilous ſeaſon to diſtract us, that ſo we might fall as a prey to a common Enemy. It is not yet too late to redreſs this evill: A few Pailsfull may yet ſeaſonably extinguiſh this weak flame, which time will make headſtrong, and irremediable. Let me boldly ſay, it is not diſputation, it is not Counter-writing that can quench it; Theſe courſes are but the bellowes to diffuſe, and raiſe theſe flaſhes to more height, and rage; we ſaw it in the practiſe of our neighbours, never did that Belgick quarrell grow to extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

If any Man herein complain of an uſurpation upon the conſcience and an unjuſt ſervitude, let him be taught the difference betwixt matters of faith, and Scholaſticall diſquiſitions: Thoſe have God for their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, theſe the brain of Men, Thoſe are contained in Scriptures, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in expreſs Terms, or irrefragable conſequences; theſe are only deduced thence by ſuch crooked inferences as cannot command aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; Thoſe do mainly import our Salvation, theſe not at all. Thoſe are for the Pulpit, theſe for the Schools; In thoſe the heart is tyed to believe, the tongue muſt be free to ſpeak, In theſe the heart may be free, the tongue may be bound, of this latter ſort are the points we have now in hand, beſides, and after the accorded particulars, which how unfit they are for popular ears, and how unworthy to break the peace of the Church, ſhall appear in the difficulty of the queſtions in the unimportance of the ill raiſed diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</p>

                  <p>Neither was that compariſon of <hi>Strigelius</hi> amiſs, who likens the place of predeſtination in Divinity to the Coſſick Rule in Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.

Where ever did the great Doctor of the Gentiles cry <hi>O altitudo</hi> but, in this point? To fall upon theſe diſcourſes then in popular auditories, what were it other, then to teach <hi>Algebra</hi> to thoſe, that yet know not their figures, or to turn them loſe into a perilous Sea, who know neither Coaſt, nor Carde, nor Compaſs.</p>
                  <p>But were the knowledg of theſe differences as neceſſary as it is hard, the difficulty ſhould but whet our appetite, and incourage our induſtry; what if it appear there is as little uſe, as eaſe in the common Canvaſſes of them; and that when the noiſe of paſſion is ſtilled on both ſides, ſo as each will but hear other ſpeak with juſt favour, and moderation, our variance ſhall be proved leſs materiall then may be worthy of the warr of Brethren. This ſhall be made good in our following diſcourſe, which I intreat both parts in the bowels of Jeſus Chriſt to examine without prejudice, as that which proceeds from an heart ſincerely devoted to truth and peace. The Judge of all hearts, before whom I ſtand, knowes with what honeſt intentions to the wellfare of this noble Church, with what freedom from all partiall affections, with what indignation at theſe unſeaſonable troubles, with what zeal of the common tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, I put my hand to this too neceſſary (if thankleſs) task. Who can tell whether God did not purpoſely ſend me to be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theſe quarrels abroad, that I might be able to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon for their appeaſing at home.</p>
                  <p>That we may diſtinguiſh the parts without any aſperſion, I ſhall crave leave to call the followers of the Tenet of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> Defendants: The other, which vary from theſe, following the ſteps, either of acute <hi>Arminius,</hi> or of our learned, and judicious Biſhop <hi>Overal,</hi> Opponents.

Let it be their part to make good their proteſted ſincerity in that aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which for peace ſake I gladly report from them at the beſt, and this peece of the quarrell ſhall receive a fair mitigation: Only I muſt needs ſay that in the contentions of brethren it is far more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to receive their own beſt conſtructions then to urge and obtrude upon them diſavowed implications. Surely there is need both of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Charity in the diſcerning of opinions concerning this point. To hold, that faith is the gift of God, as that is given to all them, whom God foreſaw would diſpoſe themſelves by the good uſe of their freewill to receive it, and who ſhould improve the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of nature to their utmoſt, is no better then <hi>Pelagian,</hi> whoſe exploded word was of old, that grace is given according to merit. To hold that faith is ſo the gift of God, as that it is therefore only not given to all, becauſe all will not receive it, for that God calleth all, and gives unto all men ſufficient helps to believe, if they will, and goes no further, and therefore that according to the previſion of our free co-working with this ſufficient grace his decree determines of us, is but ſomewhat better then <hi>Pelagian.</hi> To hold that faith is ſo the gift of God, as that he doth not only give common, and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent helps to men, whereby they are made able to believe, if they will, but ſo works in them by his grace, that they do by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thereof actually believe, and conceive true faith in their ſoul; This is fair, and Orthodoxe.

                  <p>For the Second: the queſtion is, upon what point of Mans E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, we ſhould faſten the decree of predeſtination, whiles the one part holds Man falne the object of this decree; The other Man believeing, or incredulous. What reaſon is there this ſhould raiſe ſo loud a ſtrife, ſince we do willingly wink at the reſt of the differences of like nature concerning this point. For there are fix ſeveral opinions about the object of predeſtination; whiles ſome take it to be Man indefinitely, and commonly conſidered: Others hold it to be Man, that was to be created: Others Man, as he was creable, fallable, ſaveable; others Man created, but as in his pure naturalls: Others Man falne, which is the moſt common Tenet. Laſtly others man, as believeing, or diſobeying the call of God.<note place="margin">Luc. I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relcat. Cal. Be—</note> Why ſhould theſe two laſt be brought upon the Stage with ſo much profeſſion of hoſtility, whiles the other four are paſſed over by a willing connivency on all hands, and the Authors of them (whoſe reputation ſo ſmall a mote is not thought worthy to disfigure) go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with meet honour in the Church of God. There is none of the four firſt, which, upon ſome ſtraining, may not yield harſh, and unpleaſing conſequences, and yet are let go without the miſchief of a publick diviſion. I muſt boldly ſay (reſerving my judgment concerning this point to my ſelf) that if this ſuppoſed faith may be yielded the meer guift of God (as formerly) I cannot diſcern any ſo dangerous inconvenience in this branch of the opinion, as ſhould warrant the breach of the common Peace.</p>
                  <p>As for the order, what do we brawling about our own conceits? We all know there is but one moſt ſimple Act of God in this his decree, wherein therefore there can be neither precedency not poſteriority.</p>

own ſhadowes. That God requires faith as neceſſary to Salvation is graunted of all; but in what place it comes into his decree, there is the doubt. One part makes four diſtinct acts of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, wherein the generall purpoſe of mercy to Mankind through his Son Chriſt Jeſus, to ſave believers, and the guift of neceſſary means for the attaining of faith comes before the ſpeciall decree of ſaving thoſe particulars, whom he foreſaw would believe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, perſevere; and contrarily the other makes fewer decrees in a contrary order, placing the decrees of particular election to life before the ordination of the means tending thereunto: So as faith, and perſeverance iſſue from this ſpeciall decree of chuſing individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all perſons to life. Why ſhould we be diſtracted in the abſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our own making and not rather reſt ſilent, and wondring in the acknowledgment of the ſimplicity of that one act of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely wiſe God, who doth <hi>Uno intuitu,</hi> ſee Man creable, created, falne, redeemed, believeing, which our ſhallow capacities ſhall in vain labour to comprehend. Surely it were the better poſture of our hands, to have one of them laid upon our lips, the other lifted up for admiration, then to imploy them in buffeting each other for an invincible ignorance, or miſpriſon of that, which our finite na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can never admit us to know: O God, what do we ſearch, or quarrell to miſs thoſe wayes of thine, which are paſt finding out!</p>

Now comes in a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſticall quirke to trouble the peace of Mens hearts, and brains, Whether God have ſet apart theſe certain ſingular perſons, as perſons ſingular without all reſpects to any other conſiderations. or whether his decree lookt at them as inveſted with thoſe qualities which he meant to give and foreſees as given? Doubtleſs to make Men capable of Salvation, there is faith, repentance, good works, perſeverance in good actually required of God; But theſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary diſpoſitions are ranged under the execution of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree: Theſe he requires, theſe he gives, theſe he works, theſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees to worke in his; why ſhould we be ſcrupulous in what place they come into the holy purpoſes of God, which we graunt cannot be miſſing in our way to Heaven? Why do we not rather labour to be ſuch, as he requires, that we may injoy what he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and pre-ordained for us? What ſay the <hi>Belgick</hi> Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents? Neither did we ever ſay, that thoſe ſingular perſons, whom God choſe from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity were to be conſidered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect to Chriſt, and faith in him, but have ever roundly profeſſed, that the merits of Chriſt and faith in him are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of God in this election of individual perſons, as means, whereby he hath decreed to bring them to ſalvation; ſee then how narrow this difference is, God hath decreed by theſe means to bring men to ſalvation, yet theſe fall not into his decree of ordinary choice to ſalvation, they are in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his decree, and in the decree of his execution, they are not in the decree of his election. Let theſe be undoubted truths, as they are, yet what need the ſouls of quiet Chriſtians be racked with
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:97700:210"/>
ſo ſubtile queſtions? It well befits the Schooles to examine theſe problemes, but for common Chriſtians it doth not ſo much concern them to enquire, how the order of Gods decree ſtands in our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of that one ſimple act of the divine underſtanding, or will, as how it is in reſpect of the execution: Here comes in our main in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in theſe eternall Councills of the Almighty, which drawes from us a due care, and indeavour to be capable of this promiſed ſalvation, and to avoid the wayes of death: Could we be perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take more from that ſpeculation, and to add more to this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, it would be much happier for us.</p>
                  <p>Neither is this election according to the Plea of the opponents made ever the more uncertain by this prerequiſition of our faith, ſince they profeſs to teach it ſuppoſed in our election, not as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, whoſe performance God expects, as uncertain, but as a guift, which God according to his eternall preſcience foreſees in Man preſent, and certain; as the decree of ſending Chriſt into the World, did not depend upon a conditioned, and uncertain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of what Man would do, or would not do, but upon the infallible notice of God, who foreſaw Man, as preſently ſinning, or falne, ſo as the election of God is not ſuſpended upon the muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Mans will, but upon the infallible certainty of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg of God, to whoſe eyes our faith, and perſeverance is not more doubtfull, then future, and whoſe preſcience hath no leſs infallibility, then his decree. If therefore God may have the ſole glory of this work in the guift of that faith, which he foreſees, and our election hazards no certainty (as they profeſs to hold) what is there, that ſhould need to draw blood in this firſt quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell.</p>
                  <p>But what need I labour to reconcile theſe opinions, which have no reaſon to concern us. The Church of <hi>England</hi> according to the explication of R. B. <hi>Overall</hi> goes a mid-way betwixt both theſe. For whiles the one ſide holds a generall conditionall decree of God to ſave all Men, if they believe, and a particular decree of ſaving thoſe, whom he foreſaw would believe, and the other ſide not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of that generall conditionate decree, only teaches a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular abſolute decree to ſave ſome ſpeciall perſons, for whom only Chriſt was given, and to whom grace is given, irreſiſtiblely, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers being by a no leſs abſolute decree rejected; our Church
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:97700:210"/>
(ſaith he) with St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> maintaineth an abſolute and particular decree of God to ſave thoſe, whom he hath choſen in Chriſt, not out of the preſcience of our faith, and will, but out of the meer purpoſe of his own will, and grace, and that thereupon God hath decreed to give, to whom he pleaſeth a more effectuall, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant grace, by which they only not may believe and obey, if they will, but whereby they do actually will, believe, obey, and perſevere without prejudice to the reſt, to whom he hath alſo given gracious offers, and helps to the ſame purpoſe, though by their juſt fault neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected: What can the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> in this caſe wiſh to be ſaid more? Indeed with all he addeth a general conditionate will of God, or a generall evangelical promiſe of ſaving all, if they do believe ſince God doth will, and command, that all men ſhould hear Chriſt and believe in him, and in ſo doing, hath offred grace, and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto all, declaring how well theſe two may agree together, That firſt God hath propounded ſalvation in Chriſt to all, if they believe, and hath offred them (within the Church eſpecially) a common, and ſufficient grace in the means, that he hath mercifully ordeined, if men would not be wanting to the word of God, and his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and that to aſcertain the ſalvation of man, he hath decreed to add that eſpeciall, effectuall and ſaving grace unto ſome: Neither of which truths can well and ſafely be denyed of any Chriſtian: On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſound of a generall and conditionate will, perhaps, ſeems harſh to ſome ears, whereto yet they ſhould do well to inure themſelves, ſince it is the approved diſtinction of worthy, Orthodox, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Divines.</p>

                     <pb n="377" facs="tcp:97700:211"/>As there is wont to be conceived a double knowledg of God, the one of meer underſtanding whereby he forknowes al things, that may be, the other of viſion, or approbation, whereby he foreknowes, that which undoubtedly, ſhall be ſo there is a double will to be conceived of God anſwerable to this double knowledg; an Antecedent will, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to the meer underſtanding, whereby God wills every poſſible good without the conſideration of the adjuncts appertaining to it; A conſequent will anſwering to the knowledg of approbation, whereby (all circumſtances prepenſed) God doth ſimply will this, or that particular event, as ſimply good to be, and which is there upon impoſſible not to be, The one of theſe is a will of complacency, the other of proſecution; the one is as it were an optative will, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an abſolute. In the firſt of theſe God would have all to be ſaved, becauſe it is in a ſort good in it ſelf, in that the nature of man is ordeinable to life, and man hath by God common helps ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly offered for the attaining thereof; neither can we think it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then pleaſing to God, that his creatures ſhould both do well and fare well. In the latter he willeth ſome of all to be ſaved, as not finding it ſimply good (all circumſtances conſidered) to extend this favour to all; this appears in the effect, for if God abſolutely willed it, it could not fail of being, neither doth ought hinder, but theſe two may ſtand well together, a complacence in the bleſſedneſs of his creature, and a will of his ſmart. For both that, which we will in one regard, we may not will in another, As we may wiſh a felon to live as a man, to dye as a malefactor, and beſides the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of one oppoſite doth not hinder the Act of another, as he that hath power to run perhaps doth ſit or ly.</p>
                  <p>Learned <hi>Zanchius</hi> methinks gives at once a good ſatisfaction as to this doubt, ſo to the ordinary exception, whereat many have ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, of the pretended mockage of Gods invitations,<note place="margin">De nat. Dei <hi>1.3.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi>
                     </note> where he means not, as ſome have miſconceived, a ſerious effect. In the parable of the Goſpell (ſaith he) thoſe, which were firſt bidden to the marriage feaſt, and came not, were they therefore mocked by the King, becauſe he only ſignified unto them, what would be acceptable unto him, and what was their duty to perform? and yet he did not command them to be compelled, as he did the ſecond gueſts to come to the wedding? Surely no, yet in the mean time, there was not the ſame will of the King in the inviting of the firſt,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:97700:212"/>
and of the ſecond, for in theſe ſecond, there was an abſolute will of the King, that they ſhould without fail come, and therefore he effectually cauſed them to come; In the former he only ſignified, and that fairly, and ingenuouſly, what would be pleaſing to him: Thus he. The entertainment of this one diſtinction, which hath the allowance of Orthodox, and learned Authors, to be free from any danger, or inconvenience, would mitigate this ſtrife, ſince it is that, which the Opponents contend for, which the Defendents may yield without any ſenſible prejudice.</p>
                  <p>As for the envy of that irreſpective, and abſolute decree of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, wherewith the Defendents are charged, it is well taken off, if we diſtinguiſh, as we muſt of a negative, and poſitive repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, The latter whereof, which is a preordination to puniſhment, is never without a reſpect, and previſion of ſin, for although by his abſolute power God might caſt any Creature into everlaſting torment, without any juſt exception to be taken on our parts, yet according to that ſweet providence of his, which diſpoſeth all things in a fair order of proceeding, he cannot be ſaid to inflict, or adjudge puniſhment to any ſoul, but for ſin, ſince this is an act of vindicative juſtice, which ſtill ſuppoſeth an offence. If this be yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Defendents (as it is) wherein alſo they want not the voyces even of the Romiſh School, what needs any further conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? eſpecially whiles the defendents plead (even thoſe that are moſt rigorous) that upon the non-election of ſome, damnation is not cauſally but only conſecutively inferred.<note place="margin">Non cauſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſed conſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Perk. de praedest.</note> Sure I am, that by this, which is mutually yielded on both parts, all mouths are ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped from any pretence of calumniation againſt the juſtice of the Almighty, and we are ſufficiently convinced of the neceſſity of our care to avoid thoſe ſins, which ſhall otherwiſe be rewarded with juſt damnation.</p>

Now what ſhould we ſtand upon a niggardly conteſtation of words where ſo much reall truth is mutually yielded? Who can think, there can be any peril to that ſoul, who believes thus much? The reſt to the Schools. But what ever have been the nice ſcruples, and explications of Forreign Divines, we have no ſuch cauſe of ſtrife, if
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:97700:213"/>
we admit that which our learned Biſhop commends for the voice of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who having laid down the two extream o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of the oppoſite parts, brings in the Church of <hi>England</hi> as ſweetly moderating betwixt both, that ſhe ſuppoſing the death of Chriſt for all men, and Gods conditionate intention of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral grace of his Evangelical promiſe, adds moreover the ſpecial intention of God, to apply the benefit of Chriſts death by a more abundant, and effectual grace abſolutly, certainly and infallibly to the Elect alone, without any diminution of that his ſufficient, and common favour, which, as we ſee ſo yields to both parts what they deſire, as that in the mean time, it puts upon both what they are not greatly forward to admit, yet that which it puts upon them may be admitted without any complaint, except perhaps of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of Charity, and that which is yielded is abundantly enough for peace.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Articles are like to linkes of a chain, whereof one is rivited within another. The Order of Gods decree would not be ſtiflly ſtood upon, if our faith and perſeverance foreſeen by him be clearly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to God, as his meer and only gift. But now the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are jealous of ſome incroachments, upon the glory of Gods only Act in our converſion, in that, they apprehend it according to the Tenet of the adverſe part left in our power to entertain, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the good motions of his Spirit tending thereunto; wherto the Opponents anſwer, that they are ſtudiouſly careful to aſcribe unto God the ſincere glory of our converſion, profeſſing that they do not teach, (as hath been uſually objected to them) that God gives man only profers of power to believe, which his own freedom may either except, or refuſe, but teaching openly (if their words may carry belief) that God gives him the whole power of believing by the illumination of his minde, and vivification of his will, yet ſo as that in the mean time, God, whiles he gives this new power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, doth not take away the natural liberty of the will, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the man, whoſe will is renewed both may work according to the power of that renovation, and may not work according to the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical freedom of his will, both may uſe his new power, as a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all man, and not uſe it in part, as a natural man, wherein they urge the diſtinction betwixt the power and the liberty of our freewil, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing that in this ſtate of ſin the will hath no power at all to that
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:97700:213"/>
which is good, but that it hath (mean while) a natural Liberty, whereby it can incline to evil, the new power that is given to man, doth not make him ceaſe either to be a man, or a man in part.</p>
                  <p>Man hath it not therefore from any power of nature, that he can believe, that is meerly from the grace of God; But ſtill he hath it from the remainders of himſelf, that he can will not to believe, neither do the Opponents profeſſe to ſay other concerning the firſt act of Converſion, then the Defendents themſelves ſay concerning the progreſſe thereof, wherein they teach, that a renewed man hath freedom of Will both to good, and evil, and yet ſtand for the meer and all only power of grace, not occaſionally, but cauſally working the will to good; And if this muſt be yielded in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of our regeneration, what ſo great importance is there ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way in yielding it to the entrance? I do not enquire into the truth of this point, I enquire into the weight; ſurely theſe Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the concurrence of the Spirit of God with ours; ſo as neither the will is neceſſitated on the one ſide, nor flattered with a wilde liberty on the other: And how far neceſſity may ſtand with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and what kinde of neceſſity may be here admitted? are points fit to be ranged amongſt the deepeſt problemes of the Schools, and not fit to torture the ears of popular auditories.</p>

                  <p>But what place ſover theſe differences have found in Forraign Schools, and Pulpits, ours have reaſon to be free, if we ſhall liſten to that wiſe, and moderate voice of our church, which our forecited reverend Author commends unto us, who after the relation of the two extream opinions reſteth in this, <hi>Medio tutiſſimus</hi>: that men are ſo ſtirred and moved by Grace that they may, if they attend thereunto, obey the grace, which calleth, and moveth them; And that they may, by their freewil alſo reſiſt it. But withal, that God, when he will, and to whom he will gives ſuch an abundant, ſuch powerful, ſuch congruous, otherwiſe effectual grace that although the will may in reſpect of the liberty thereof reſiſt, yet it reſiſts not, but doth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,

and infallibly obey: And that thus God deals with thoſe whom he hath choſen in Chriſt, ſo far as ſhall be neceſſary to their ſalvation. Who ſo cannot ſit down quietly in this deciſion me thinks ſhould be no friend to peace.</p>

That the only grace of God is the ſupernatural cauſe of perſeverance, which makes our will both able, and willing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere, he would think there need no more words, that this quarrel were at a happy end.</p>
                  <p>But when he ſhall ſee them flying off into the diſtinctions of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty for the preſent, and certainty for the future, and dividing this latter into abſolute, and conditionate, diſclaiming the one, and eſtabliſhing the other, ſo as this certainty walkes ſtill in even paces with perſeverance, and we can only be ſure of Salvation, if we continue in faith, and piety; but we cannot be ſure we ſhall continue in either, and hear them conclude it to be both laudable, and profitable for a Chriſtian to nouriſh theſe doubts in himſelf, now he might, as eaſily be induced to think, that theſe ends can never meet.</p>
                  <p>And yet the oppoſites ſtrain hard for an accordance, whiles they diſtinguiſh of faiths, and yield it fit to conſider a faithfull Mans Eſtate in reſpect of himſelf, his own weakneſs, and Sathans frauds, and in reſpect of the firme promiſes, and ſupportations of a faithful God: In regard of the former granting it more then poſſible, that he ſhould utterly fall away from God; but in regard of the latter faſtening their perſwaſion upon the unremoveable Rock of their aſſurance.</p>
                  <p>But what need I lanch forth into this forrain deep? Thoſe Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents, which perſeverance meets with in our Church either are, or ſhould be of a ſofter temper, maintaining only ſuch falling away from grace, as reverend B. <hi>Overall</hi> ſtateth for the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe laſt moderation in this point is worthy to be written in Letters of Gold. Having firſt ſet down the two contrary Tenets of the oppoſite parts, he now brings in the Church of <hi>England</hi> thus (with St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>) defining, as from a Celeſtial Chair.</p>
                  <p>That believers, as in a common acception, may through infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of fleſh, and power of temptation, depart, and fall off from grace, and faith once received, but thoſe believers, which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led according to the purpoſe of God, and which are ſoundly rooted in a lively faith, can neither totally, nor finally fall away and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh everlaſtingly, but by the ſpecial, and effectual grace of God, do ſo perſevere in a true, and lively faith, that at laſt they are brought unto eternal Life.</p>

                     <pb n="386" facs="tcp:97700:216"/>Now, what wiſe Chriſtian, can make dainty of admitting ſo neceſſary, and juſt a diſtinction, ſince common experience tells us, there are many Meteors, that for the time ſhine like bright Stars over our heads, which ere long we find under our feet reſolved into a baſe and ſlimy ſlough? what heart can deſire a more full and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying determination, wherein both ſides have their own, and we quietly enjoy what is true in both, when thus much is mutually yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, let him be branded for an enemy of peace, that will further contend.</p>
                  <p>Now when the Chriſtian Reader hath ſeriouſly peruſed theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, eſpecially as they are propounded, and arbitrated by that grave profeſſor, and Prelate of our Church on the one ſide, and thoſe other our learned, and worthy Divines on the other ſide; Let me appeal to his better thoughts, what he finds here worthy of a publick diviſion? Well may the Schools pick hence matter enough for their Theological Problemes, but what ſhould either the Pulpit, or the preſs do with theſe buſie and bootleſs brabbles? My Brethren, let our care be to ſtudy, and preach Chriſt, and him crucified: To work the ſouls of Men to faith, repentance, piety, juſtice, Charity, temperance, and all other heavenly vertues, that they may find cordial Teſtimonies in themſelves of their happy predeſtination to Life, and their infallible Intereſt in the precious blood of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer: Let us beat down thoſe ſins in them, which make them obnoxious to everlaſting damnation and ſtrip them of all comfortable aſſurances of the favour of God: Let us not undiſcreetly ſpend our time, and pains in diſtracting their thoughts with thoſe Scholaſtical diſquiſitions, whereof the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg or ignorance makes nothing to Heaven. The way to bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not ſo ſhort, that we ſhould finde leaſure to make outroads into needleſſe and unprofitable ſpeculations; Never Treatiſe could be more neceſſary in this curious and quarrellous age, then <hi>de paucitate credendorum.</hi> The infinite ſubdiviſions of thoſe points, which we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to the honour of being the objects of our belief, confound our thoughts and marr our peace. Peaceable diſcourſe may have much latitude, but matter of faith ſhould have narrow bounds. If in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, men will abound in their own ſence, alwaies let unity of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit be held in the bond of peace; ſince God hath given us change of rayment, and variety of all intellectual proviſions, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaid to

his brethren, let me to mine; Let us not fall out by the way. Now by the dear bonds of brotherhood, by our love to our common mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church, by our holy care, and zeal of the proſperous ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus, Let us all compoſe our hearts to peace; and reſt our ſelves in thoſe common truths, which ſober mindes ſhall find abundantly ſufficient whether for our knowledg, or ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>I have done, and now I make no other account, but that it will fall out with me, as it commonly doth with him, that offers to part a fray; both parts will perhaps drive at me for wiſhing them no worſe then peace. My ambition of the publick tranquillity ſhall willingly carry me through this hazard: Let both beat me, ſo their quarrel may ceaſe; I ſhall rejoyce in thoſe blowes and ſcarres, which I ſhall take for the Churches ſafety: Mens fingers do ſo itch after the maintenance of their own opinions, that they can hardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain themſelves from flying upon the faireſt moderation of any Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Yet I may ſafely profeſs, that herein I have carried my ſelf ſo indifferently, that as I have hid my own Judgment, ſo I have ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeemed partiall againſt my own reſolutions. If any Man object, that I have not fully ſtated the queſtions on both ſides, and drawn my accorded propoſitions out of the heart of thoſe Tenets, which both parts will yield to be their own in an adverſaries ſence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out waving any conſequences, that ſhall be deduced there from, Let him receive anſwear to the former of theſe, that it were a fit task for him, that intended a full tractation of the points contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and is already too much done by others, my drift is only to pick out of both what may ſound towards concord. He that would deſcribe the way to ſome remote Citty of marque, thinkes it not needful to map out before the Traveller every Town, and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of all the Shires, through which he ſhould paſs, but only ſets down thoſe that lye in his road.</p>
                  <p>To the latter, that it is a more ſtrict rule, then needs to be put upon an Agent for peace. For as it is but juſt on the one ſide, that every man ſhould be allowed to be his own interpreter, and prejudice and ill will can never make good gloſſe: So on the other ſide, it is lawful and meet for moderate mindes to make their beſt uſe of thoſe ſavory and wholeſome ſentences which fall
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:97700:217"/>
from the better moode of an adverſary, ſuch, ſo farr, as they come home to me, ſhall gladly reconcile him to me. Let him look how in the reſt he can be reconciled to himſelf; Very ſhame ſhall at the laſt drive ſuch a one (if he be ingenuous) from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible propoſitions.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the good, that he offers, I will not refuſe, and leave the evil to his avoiding: As a man, that meets with a ſlack debtor, will not be unwilling to take what ſmall ſummes he can get, till either more may come in, or he may conveniently ſue for the reſt. It is good to hold the ground we have got, till by the power of truth we can recover more.</p>
                  <p>Not that I could readily take up with the palpable Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of an <hi>Arrius,</hi> or <hi>Pelagius</hi>; No wiſe Chapman will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himſelf to be paid with ſlips. Truth, and Falſhood will neceſſarily deſcry themſelves; Neither is it hard for a judicious Reader to diſcerne a difference betwixt yielding, and diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling; Where I ſee a man conſtant to himſelf in a favourable aſſertion, I have reaſon to conſtrue it, as a fair comming off towards reconcilement. If nothing but the rigour of opinions ſhall be ſtood upon, what Hope can there be of Peace? To ſhut up therefore, if what I have here meant well, be as well taken, and well improved, I ſhall have comfort in the quieting of many Hearts, and many Tongues: If not, at leaſt I ſhall have comfort in the quietneſſe of mine own heart; which tels me I have wiſhed <hi>well</hi> to the Church of God.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y good Mr. <hi>B.</hi> You ſend me flowers from your Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and Look for ſome in returne out of mine; I do not more willingly ſend you theſe, then I do thankfully receive the other: I could not keep my hand from the paper, upon the receit of your Letters, though now in the midſt of my attendance: As my deſire of your ſatisfaction cals me to write ſomthing, ſo my other imployments force me to brevity, in a queſtion wherein it were eaſy to be endleſſe: I am ſorry that any of our new <hi>Excuti-fidians</hi> ſhould peſter your <hi>Suffolk</hi>; although glad in this, that they could not Light upon a ſoyle more fruitful of able oppugners: it is a wonder to me, to think that men ſhould Labour to be witty, to rob themſelves of comfort: Good <hi>Sir</hi> Let me know theſe new Diſciples of <hi>Leyden</hi>; that I may note them with that black cole they are worthy of; Troublers of a better peace then that of the Church, the peace of the Chriſtian ſoul: they pretend antiquity; What hereſy doth not ſo? What marvell is
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:97700:218"/>
it, if they would wreſt Fathers to them, while they uſe Scripture it ſelf ſo violently; For that their firſt inſtance of <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> how vain it is like themſelves?</p>
                  <p>Nothing can be more plain then that thoſe men were groſſe hyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites; who doubts therefore but they might fall from all that good, they pretended to have; What is this to prove that a true child of God may do ſo: but (ſay they) theſe men had faith and a good conſcience; True, ſuch a faith and goodneſſe of conſcience as may be incident into a Worldly counterfeit. Yea but (they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply) a true juſtifying faith; I think ſuch a one as their own; rather I may ſay theſe men deſevre not the praiſe of <hi>Himeneus</hi> his faith; which is nothing in this place but Orthodoxe doctrine; How oft doth St. <hi>Paul</hi> uſe the word ſo, to his <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. <hi>In the latter times ſome ſhall depart from the faith</hi>; interpreted in the next words, <hi>and ſhall give heed to ſpirits of error, and doctrines of Devills</hi>; and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8. He deſcribes his falſe teachers by this title, <hi>Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate concerning the faith</hi>; Which I think no man will expound of the grace, but he Doctrine: Yet (ſay they) there is no neceſſity binds us to that ſenſe here? But the ſcope of this place compared with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may evince it; That which followes plainly points us to this meaning (that they might learn not to blaſpheme) Their ſin was therefore an Apoſtaſy from the Doſtrine of the Goſpel, and caſting foul aſperſions upon that profeſſion; ſo that an oppoſition to whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Doctrine was their ſhipwrack: They except yet; A good conſcience is added to this faith; therefore it muſt needs be meant of juſtifying faith; Do but turne your eyes to 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.9. where (as in a commentary upon this place) you ſhall finde faith and good conſcience ſo conjoyned; that yet the Doctrine, not the vertue of faith is ſignified: St. <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribes his Deacon there by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual wealth; <hi>Having the mystery of faith in pure conſcience:</hi> No man can be ſo groſſe to take the myſtery of faith for the grace of faith; or for any other then the ſame Author in the ſame chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cals the myſtery of Godlyneſs: It is indeed fit that a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſhould be the cofer, where truth of Chriſtian Doctrine is the treaſure; Therefore both are juſtly commanded together; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly each accompanies other in their loſs, and that of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> is found true of all hereticks; <hi>ſententiam impiam, vitam luxurioſam, &amp;c.</hi> Yea but <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> had both theſe then, and loſt both:
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:97700:218"/>
They had both in outward profeſſion, not in inward ſincerity; that rule is certain and eternal, If they had been of us, they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with us; nothing is more ordinary with the Spirit of God then to ſuppoſe us ſuch as we pretend; that he might give us an example of Charity in the cenſure of each other: of which kind is that noted place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. <hi>And counteth the blood of the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherewith he was ſanctifyed an unholy thing</hi>; and thoſe unuſual elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies which are given to the Churches, to whom the Apoſtolical letters were directed.</p>
                  <p>This place therefore intends no other but that <hi>Himenaeus</hi> and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> which were once profeſſors of the Chriſtian doctrine, and ſuch as lived orderly in an unblameable, and outwardly holy faſhion to the World, had now turn'd their copy; caſt off the profeſſion which they made, and were fallen both to looſeneſſe of manners, &amp; calumniation of the truth they had abandoned.</p>
                  <p>For that other Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.12, 13. No place can be more effectual to cut the throat of this uncomfortable hereſy: St. <hi>Paul</hi> writes to a mixt company; it were ſtrange if all the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould have been truly ſanctifyed; thoſe which were yet carnal he threats with death, <hi>If ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall dye</hi>; Thoſe which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate (contrary to the wicked paradox of thoſe men) he aſſures of life; <hi>If ye mortifie the deeds of the fleſh by the Spirit, ye ſhall live</hi>: How doth he exclude the Spirit of bondage to fear; which theſe good guides would lead in again; how confidently doth he averr the inward teſtimony of Gods Spirit to ours; and aſcribes that voice to it which bars all doubt and diſappointment; and tels us by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful aſſurance of this <hi>Abba,</hi> we are ſons, and if ſons heirs, coheirs with Chriſt; Let them now go and ſay; that God may diſinherit his own ſon, that he may caſt off his adopted: But, ſay they, to the ſame regenerate perſons he applyes theſe two clauſes, and ſaith at once, <hi>ye have received the Spirit of adoption,</hi> and yet, <hi>if ye walk after the fleſh ye ſhall die</hi>; what followes of this commination? any aſſertion of the poſſibility of Apoſtaſy in the regenerate? Nothing leſſe: Theſe threats are to make us take better hold, and to walk more warily; as a father that hath ſet his little ſon on horſeback (it is <hi>Zanchies</hi> compariſon) bids him hold faſt, or elſe he ſhall fall; though he uphold him the while; that both he may cauſe him hereby to ſit faſt; and call the more earneſtly for his ſupportation. But the ſcope of
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:97700:219"/>
the place plainly extorts a diviſion of carnal men and regenerate; the threats are propounded to the one, the promiſes and aſſurance to the other; and therefore no touch from hence of our uncertainty in a confeſſed eſtate of renovation.</p>
                  <p>For that <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.43. The <hi>Apodoſis,</hi> or inference of the parable might well have ſtop't the mouthes of theſe Cavillers: for you ſhall finde in the end of it; ſo ſhall it be with this wicked generation; I ſuppoſe no man will be ſo abſurd, as to ſay theſe Jewes had formerly received true juſtifying faith; How ſhould they, when they reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Meſſias</hi>? And yet of them is this parable ſpoken by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours own explication: <hi>Maldonate</hi> himſelf a learned and ſpightful Jeſuite, can interpret it no otherwiſe. <hi>Ideo Chriſtus hoc dixit ut do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceret pejores eſſe Judaeos, quam ſi nunquam Dei legem &amp; cognitionem ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepiſſent,</hi> and to this purpoſe he cites <hi>Hilary, Hierom, Beda</hi>; and this ſence is ſo clear, that unleſſe the ſeven Devils had found harbour in the dry hearts of theſe men, they could not ſo groſly pervert it; <hi>Quench not the Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. will never prove a final or total ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of ſaving grace; the Spirit is quenched when the degrees of it are abated; when the good motions thereof are by our ſecurity let fall; we grant the Spirit may be quenched in <hi>tanto</hi> not in <hi>toto</hi>; Or if we ſhould ſo take it, as they deſire; I remember <hi>Auſtin</hi> parallels this place with that other to <hi>Timothy, Let no man deſpiſe thy youth</hi>; Not, ſaith he, that the Spirit can be quenched, or that contempt can be avoided; but that in the one we may not indeavour to do that which may tend towards this wrong to the Spirit; and in the other that we ſhould be careful not to do that which may procure contempt; The place, I remember not directly; but <hi>numeros teneo, ſi verba tenerem:</hi> But in all likelyhood that place ſounds quite another way; as may appear by the connexion of it with thoſe two ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces following; As if he ſhould have ſaid, diſcourage not the graces that you finde in any of your Teachers; deſpiſe not their preaching; trye their doctrines: And now what is this to the falling from Grace? Which of us do not teach the neceſſity of perſeverance? He only that indures to the end ſhall be ſaved; <hi>Be faithful to the death, and, &amp;c.</hi> But he that hath ordained we ſhall be ſaved, hath ordained our perſeverance as a mean to this ſalvation; and hath appointed theſe ſharp adviſes as the means and motives of our perſeverance: So as he that ſhall <hi>be ſaved ſhall alſo indure to the end; Becauſe no man

plucks them out of my hand,</hi> ſaith Chriſt: How evidently doth the Spirit of God proclaime our certainty againſt theſe doubt-mongers? Every where is he as full of aſſurance, as theſe men of diſcomfort: <hi>He that is borne of God ſinneth not, neither can ſin, becauſe he is born of God, and the ſeed of God remaines in them</hi>; what an invincible,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.3.</note> and irrefragable conſolation is this?

have right to it, are excluded with equal importunity. Bleſſed be God you were born and bred in a noble and renowned Daughter of that great and univerſal Mother, the Church of <hi>England,</hi> what reaſon can an Enemy ſhow you why you ſhould repent you of ſuch a parentage and ſpit in the face of ſo gracious a Mother and nurſe, nothing it ſeems, is urged to you but her age; It is a killing word with thoſe Romiſh Impoſters, where was your Church before <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> then which, there was never any plea more idle, more fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous, when it falls under a wiſe and judicious diſcuſſion; for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider I beſeech you. Did we go about to lay the foundations of a new Church, the challenge were moſt juſt; <hi>Primum verum</hi> was the old and ſure rule of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> we abhorr new Churches, and new Truths, find ours either to be, or to be pretended ſuch, and forſake us: But when all our claim, all our endeavour is onely the reforming and repairing of an old Church, faulty in ſome moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſtones, and miſ-daubed with ſome untempered, and lately laid morter, what a frenzy is this to ask where that Church was which we ſhow them ſenſibly thus repaired, had it not been before how could it have been capable of this amendment, and if it be but reformed by us, It was formed before, and having been ſince de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by their errors, is only reſtored by us to the former beauty. As ſure as there is any Church, any truth in the World this is the true and only State of this controverſie, the miſ-priſion whereof hath been guilty of the loſs of many thouſand ſouls. To ſpeak plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is onely the groſs abuſes, and palpable innovations of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> which we have parted from, ſet theſe aſide, they, and we, are, and will be one Church, let this be done, and if their cruelty, and uncharitableneſs would ſever us, our unity of faith and Chriſtian love ſhall make us one, in ſpight of malice: If their miſ-zealous importunity will needs ſo incorporate thoſe which we can convince for new errours, as to make them eſſential to the very being of their Church, they are more injurious to themſelves, then their Enemies can be, we can but lament to ſee them guilty of their own miſchief: For us we have erred in nothing but this, that we would not err; to demonſtrate this in particulars, were a long-ſome task, and that which I have already performed in that my treatiſe of the Old Religion, may it pleaſe you to let fall your eye upon that plain and moderate diſcourſe, you ſhall confeſs this truth made good,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:97700:224"/>
every parcel whereof I am ready to juſtifie againſt all gainſayers; when theſe Men therefore ſhall ask, where our Church was, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them boldly, where it is; It is with Churches, as with thoſe ſeverall perſons, whereof they conſiſt, give me a Man that having been Romiſh for opinion is now grown wiſer, and reformed, he hath ſtill the ſame form or eſſence, though not the ſame errors, he is the ſame Man then, yea I add he is the ſame Chriſtian that he was whiles he holds firmly all thoſe Articles of Catholick faith which are eſſentiall to Chriſtianity; if he now find reaſon to reject thoſe hideous novelties of the inerrability of a Man of ſin, of the new and monſtrous, but inviſible, incarnation of his Saviour by charm of a ſinfull Prieſt, of marting of ſins, of purgatory flames, and the reſt of that upſtart rabble of the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Creed, whiles he undoubtedly believes all thoſe truths which carried our Fathers (who lived before the hatching of theſe devices) ſafely and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Heaven, who can deny him the honor of true Catholiciſme and Chriſtianity: No otherwiſe is it in whole Churches, whereof every believeing ſoul is an abridgment; if any of them find juſt cauſe to refuſe ſome newly obtruded opinions, which the reſt are ſet to maintain, whiles in the mean time the foundation remains entire, this can be no ground to diſ-Church that differing company of Chriſtians, neither are they other from themſelves, upon this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of opinion.</p>
                  <p>But I hear what ſome whiſperers ſay: It is the determination of the Church which makes what points ſhe thinks fit, <hi>de fide,</hi> and fundamental: Let me confidently ſay this is the moſt dangerous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation that can fall into the ears, hearts, hands of Chriſtians; If the Church can make another God, another Chriſt, another Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, other Prophets and Apoſtles, ſhe may alſo lay another foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; But the old rule of the choſen Veſſel, wheron I ſecurely caſt my ſoul, is,

or any other City under Heaven, or what priviledg hath the <hi>Italian</hi> Church, above the <hi>Greek, French, Germane, Engliſh,</hi> It is the charge of the Apoſtle: <hi>My Brethren have not the faith of God in reſpect of perſons</hi>: I may upon the ſame Grounds, ſay, in reſpect of places, the locality of truth is the moſt idle and childiſh plea, that ever impoſed upon wiſe men: Away with this foppery the true divinity of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was, and is, in every Nation he that feareth God and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth righteouſneſs is accepted of him, the climate makes no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and if more reſpect have been antiently given to that See, then to others, it was the ſoveraignty of the City which then drew on thoſe honours to the Church; which upon the very ſame reaſon were no leſſe tranſmitted to <hi>Constantinople</hi>: Set thoſe aſide, and what holineſſe can <hi>Tiber</hi> challenge above <hi>Rhene,</hi> or <hi>Thames?</hi> Let fooles be mocked with theſe fancies, but you whom God hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with ſingular judgment and underſtanding in all things will eaſily reſent the fraud; and ſee that there is no more reaſon why the Engliſh Church ſhould conform in opinion to the Romiſh (were the Doctrines equally indifferent) then the Roman Church to the Engliſh. They are but the ſeveral limms of one large and univerſal body; and if in reſpect of outward order there have been, or may be acknowledged a precedency, yet in regard of the main ſubſtance of truth we cannot admit of any dependance on any Church under Heaven; Here, that which is the purer from Error and corruption, muſt take the wall, maugre all the loud throats of acclaming para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, yea ſo far muſt we needs be from pinning our faith upon the ſleeve of <hi>Rome,</hi> as that we cannot (without violence offered to our own conſciences) but ſee and ſay that there is no particular Church on Earth, ſo branded by the Spirit of God, in the Scriptures, as <hi>Rome</hi>; In ſo much as the beſt abbettors, and deareſt fautors of that See, are glad to plead that <hi>Rome</hi> is St. <hi>Peters</hi> and St. <hi>Johns Babylon</hi>: we bleſſe God for ſtanding on our own feet, and thoſe feet of ours ſtand upon the infallible grounds of the Prophets, and Apoſtles, of Primitive Creeds, Councels, Fathers, and therefore we can no more deceive you, then they can deceive us.</p>
                  <p>The cenſure that the enemies of our Church caſt upon it, is not untruth, but defect, they dare not but grant what we ſay is true, but they blame us for not ſaying all is true which they ſay; now that which we ſay, was enough to ſerve thoſe antient Chriſtians, which
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:97700:225"/>
lived before thoſe lately deviſed additions, the refuſal whereof is made haynous and deadly to us; how ſafe, how happy is this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring? Let my ſoul be with thoſe bleſſed Martyrs, Confeſſors, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Chriſtians which never lived to hear of thoſe new Articles of the new Roman faith, and I dare ſay, you will not wiſh yours any other where, there can be no danger in old truths, there can be nothing but danger in new obtruſions. But I finde how apt my pen is to over-run the bounds of a letter, my zeal of your ſafety carries me into this length, the errors into which theſe ſeducers would lead you are deadly, eſpecially upon a revolt: your very ingenuity I hope (beſides grace) will ſuggeſt better things to you: Hold that which you have, that no man take your crown; My Soul for yours you go right; ſo ſure as there is a heaven, this way will lead you thither, go on confidently, and cheerfully in it, let me never be happy, if you be not; you will pardon my holy importunity, which ſhall be ever ſeconded with my hearty prayers to the God of truth, that he will ſtabliſh your heart in that eternal truth of his Goſpel which you have received, and both work and crown your happy perſeverance; ſuch ſhall be the fervent apprecations of</p>

                  <head>RESOLUTIONS FOR RELIGION.</head>
                  <p>WHereas there are many loud quarrels, and brabbles about matter of Religion, this is my firme and ſteadfaſt Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, wherein I finde peace with God, and my own Soul, as being undoubtedly certain in it ſelf, and holily charitable to others, and that in which I conſtantly purpoſe (God willing) as to Live ſo to Dye.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I do believe and know that there is but one way to Heaven, even the True and Living way, Jeſus Chriſt, God and Man the Saviour of the World.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I believe and know, that this way however it is a narrow and ſtraight way, in reſpect of the World, yet hath much Latitude in it ſelf: So as thoſe that truely believe in this Son of God, their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, though they may be miſ-led into many by-pathes of ſmall er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, yet by the mercy of God are acknowledged not to be out of the main high way to eternal life.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I believe and know, that the Canonical Scriptures of God are the true and unfailing Rule of our Faith, ſo as whatſoever is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contain'd is the infallible Truth of God, and whatſoever is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be believed to eternal Salvation, is therein expreſly, or by clear and undoubted conſequence contein'd, and ſo ſet forth as it neither needeth farther explication, nor admits of any probable Contradiction.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I believe and know, that God hath ever ſince the creation of Mankinde had a Church upon Earth, and ſo ſhall have to the end of the World, which is a Society or Communion of Faithful men profeſsing his Name, againſt which the gates of Hell ſhall never be able to prevail, for the failing thereof.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I believe and know, that the conſenting voice of the ſucceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:97700:226"/>
and preſent univerſality of faithful Men in all times and places, is worthy of great authority, both for our Confirmation in all truths, and for our direction in all the circumſtantial points of Gods ſervice; ſo as it cannot be oppoſed, or ſever'd from, without juſt offence to God.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. I believe and know, that beſides thoſe neceſſary truths con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Holy Scriptures and Seconded by the Conſent and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of all Gods faithful ones, there may be, and ever have been, certain collateral and not-mainly importing verities, wherein it is not unlawful, for ſeveral particular Churches, to maintain their own Tenets, and to diſſent from other; and the ſeveral members of thoſe particular Churches are bound, ſo far to tender the common Peace; as not to oppoſe ſuch publiquely received truths.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. I do confidently believe, that if all the particular Churches, through the whole Chriſtian World, ſhould meet together, and determine theſe ſecondary and unimporting truthes to be believed upon neceſsity of Salvation, and ſhall enact Damnation to all thoſe which ſhall deny their aſſent thereunto, they ſhould go beyond the Commiſsion which God hath given them, and do an act which God hath never undertaken to warrant: Since there can be no new Principles of Chriſtian Religion, however there may be an applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of ſome formerly received Divine truthes to ſome emergent occaſions, and a clearer explication of ſome obſcure verities.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. I do confidently believe that God hath never confin'd the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of his will in all queſtions and matters, pertaining to Salvation, or whatſoever controverſies of Religion to the breaſt of any one Man, or to a particular Church, or to a correſpondence, of ſome particular Churches, ſo as they ſhall not poſsibly err, in their Definitions and Decrees.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. I do confidently believe, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending both the head and thoſe her adherents, and dependance, being but particular Churches, have highly offended God in arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating to themſelves the priviledg of infallibility which was never given them, and in ordaining new Articles of faith, and excluding from the boſome of Gods Church, and the Gates of Heaven all thoſe which differ from her in the refuſal of her late bred im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, though otherwiſe holy men, and no leſs true Chriſtians, then any of themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="10">
                     <pb n="407" facs="tcp:97700:226"/>10. I do confidently believe, that though it be a thing very requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to publick peace and good order, that every ſeveral Chriſtian ſhould be ranged under ſome particular Church, and every particular aſſembly to be ſubordinate to ſome higher Government, which may overſee &amp; over rule them in the caſe of different opinions and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of practiſe; yet that God hath not required, or commanded either of theſe upon neceſſity of Salvation; ſo as an <hi>Indian</hi> convert, in the remoteſt part of the World believing in Chriſt, may without relation to any Church whatſoever be ſaved; and a particular Church being Orthodox in the main principles of Religion, upon matter of litigious conteſtation, flying off from ſome more eminent Church under which it was ranked for Orders ſake, however it may be faulty, in an undue diviſion, yet is not hereby excluded from the capacity of ſalvation; ſince ſuch ſleight jarrs, and unkindneſſes in Churches, can no more ſhut them out, from a common intereſt in Chriſt, then the like quarrels of a <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, Act.</hi> 15.39. could keep either of them out of Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. I do confidently believe, that all the particular National Churches, through the whole Chriſtian World, are no other then Siſters, Daughters of the ſame Father God; of the ſame Mother, the Spiritual <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is from above; ſome of them are El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Siſters, others Younger: Some more Tall and large ſpread; others of leſs ſtature, ſome fairer in reſpect of Holyneſs of life and Orthodoxie of Judgment; others fouler in reſpect of Corruptions, both of doctrine and manners; ſtill Siſters; and if any of them ſhall uſurpe a Miſtreſs-ſhip over the reſt, or make her ſelf a Queen over them, and make them ſubjects and ſlaves to her; or a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood to the reſt (otherwiſe then in a priority and aid of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) and make them, but Daughters and Punies to her; She ſhall be guilty of an high Arrogance and Preſumption, againſt Chriſt and his dear Spouſe, the Church; ſince with the juſt and holy God, there is no reſpect of perſons or places, but in all Nations thoſe that ſerve him beſt, are moſt accepted of him.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. From hence will follow this double <hi>Corollarie</hi>: Firſt, That (as there is a kinde of natural equality in Siſterhood) no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular National Church can by right of any inſtitution of God, chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leng a commanding power over the reſt, however ſome one may have a precedency to other, in reſpect, whether of more conſtant
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:97700:227"/>
Holyneſs and ſyncerity, or more ſpeed of converſion; or of larger extent; or of that civil greatneſſe, and preeminence of that State or Nation, wherein it is ſetled; And upon this occaſion may &amp; muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and exerciſe her eminence, to the defence and furtherance of the weaker &amp; more diſtreſſed: But if any particular National Church being leſs able to ſuſte in it ſelf, ſhall agree voluntarily to ſubmit her ſelf (for orders ſake and for ſafety and protection) to the ſway of one more famous and powerful, her ingagement doth juſtly binde her, ſo far as lawfully it reacheth; <hi>viz.</hi> To accknowledg a priority of place, and to reſpect her directions in matters of forme and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Adminiſtration, ſo long as they vary not from the rule, which God hath ſet in his Church: But if that more potent Church ſhall abuſe that power and begin to exerciſe Tyranny over the weaker, by forceing upon her new and undue impoſitions of faith, or intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable inſolencies in government; there is no law of God that binds that weaker Church <hi>Iſſachar</hi>-like to lye down between two burdens, ſhe may challenge and reſume the right of a Siſter, and ſhake off the yoak of a ſlave, without the violation of any command of God; and not the injuried but the oppreſſor is guilty of the breach of peace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It will hence follow, that the relation of this common Siſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of all Chriſtian Churches, juſtly tyes all thoſe that profeſſe the name of Chriſt, to a charitable regard of each to other: So as though there be in ſome of them groſs errors in matters of Doctrine, and foul corruptions in matters of practiſe, yet whiles they hold and maintain, all the Articles of the ſame Chriſtian faith and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the ſame Scriptures, the ſubſtance of the ſame baptiſme, and of the inſtitution of the Holy Euchariſt, they ceaſe not to continue Siſters, notwithſtanding their manifold enormities, and depravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; theſe are enough to deforme any Church, not enough to Diſ-church it; Theſe are enough to impair the health, not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave the life; Howſoever therefore we muſt alwaies hate, and cry down their errors (which a wilful maintenance makes no leſſe then damnable) yet we muſt pity and pray for their Perſons, and by all good means, labour to bring them to an acknowledgment of the oppoſed truth; and although I well know there is ill uſe made of our charity this way; by thoſe willing miſtakers who turne it to our diſadvantage; that we paſs ſo favourable cenſures upon their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:97700:227"/>
whiles they paſs ſo cruel and mercileſs cenſures upon ours, yet my conſcience bids me to ſay that I cannot repent of this juſt ſentence wherein I know I ſhall finde comfort in my appearance, before the dreadful Tribunal of God, when the uncharitableneſs and injuſtice of theſe bloody men, that ſend their charitable oppoſers to a remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe damnation, ſhall be adjudged to that Hell, which they have preſumptuouſly doomed unto others: As for them, let them ſee how they can anſwer it to that juſt Judge of the World in that great day, that they have preſumed to blot out of the book of life ſo many millions of faithful Chriſtians, only for diſſenting from them in ſuch points as God never gave them warrant to impoſe.</p>
                  <p>From the force then of this Relation it is eaſily ſubinfer'd that it is not lawful for Chriſtian Churches, upon differences about points not eſſential to the faith either voluntarily to forſake the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of each other, or forceably to abdicate and thruſt out each other from their communion. There being the ſame reaſon in this behalf, of a Church, and a ſeveral Chriſtian: As therefore one Chriſtian may not abandon another for differences of opinion in matters not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be believed; ſo neither may one Church, upon ſuch ground either leave or expel another, but if any ſuch act be done, it is to be inquired both where the fault is, and what may be the Remedy.</p>
                  <p>In a meer ſimple dereliction of a Church thus differing, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſo to err, the faults muſt needs be in the Church forſaking: But where the departure is accompanyed with ſuch circumſtances, as may be ſuppoſed to be incident in ſuch caſes, there the ſtate of the buſineſs may be altered, and the blame of either part, either taken off or aggravated. To inſtance in the proſecution of this Relation which we have in hand: Two Siſters are appointed by their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to looke to her houſe, the charge is given equally to both, the Mother is no ſooner out of ſight, then the Elder begins to domineer over the younger, and requires her to do ſomething in the Family, which ſhe conceives may tend to the prejudice of the common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and croſſe the Mothers intention, the younger finding her ſelf grieved, with this carriage, and diſliking the task injoyned, both forbears to do it and ſeriouſly expoſtulates with her Siſter; laying before her the inconveniencies which will follow upon ſuch an act; the Elder impatient of a contradiction, not only gives ſharpe lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:97700:228"/>
but thruſts her Siſter out of doors; neither will admit her to come in again, except ſhe ſubmit her ſelf to her authority, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that chare which ſhe formerly refuſed, the Younger holds off, as thinking ſhe may not yield without wrong to herſelf, and to her Mothers Truſt: The Siſters are now thus parted; but where is the blame? The Younger is gone away from the Elder; but ſhe doth it upon the Elders violence; on the one ſide, ſhe had not gone if ſhe had not been thruſt out; on the other ſide ſhe had not been thruſt out, if ſhe had not refuſed to do the thing required; on the one ſide, the Elder might not be ſo imperious, nor injoyn a thing unfit; on the otherſide the Younger might not upon ſuch a command voluntarily forſake the Elder; but if the Elder ſhall unjuſtly challenge ſuch au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and ſhall thereupon impoſe unmeet ſervices; and ſhall put the Younger out of doors for not performing them, it is clear where the fault reſts.</p>
                  <p>I appeal to God, and the conſciences of all juſt men, if this be not the ſtate of the preſent differences, of the Romans and Reformed Churches; the remedy whereof muſt therefore begin from thoſe parties which have given cauſe of the breach; if they ſhall remit of their undue Height and Rigour, and be content, with thoſe Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate bounds which God hath ſet them both for Doctrine, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and yeild themſelves but capable of error, there may be poſſibility of Reunion, and Peace: But whiles they perſiſt to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge an infallibility of judgment, and uncontrollableneſs of practiſe, they do wilfully block up the way to all reconciliation and concord, and ſtand guilty of all that Grievous Schiſm, under which the Church of God, thus long and miſerably ſuffers.</p>
                  <p>And this upon full deliberation, is my ſetled and finall Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; concerning the main difference in Religion; wherein my ſoul doth ſo confidently reſt; that I dare therewith boldly appear before the face of that great Judge of the Quick and Dead, as knowing it infallibly warranted by his own UNDOUBTED WORD.</p>

                  <p>THe caſe whereof you complan is not more worthy of ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy then of pity; and yet in true judgment not ſo haynous as you conceive it: Evil motions are caſt into you, which yet you entertain not with conſent: Let me aſſure you theſe are not your ſins, but his that injects them: You may be (as you are) troubled with their importunity; but you are not tainted with their evil, whiles you diſlike and hate them, and are grieved with their ſuggeſtion: That bold and ſuttle enemy of ours durſt caſt temptations into the Son of God himſelf, in whom yet he could finde nothing. It were wo with us, if leud motions (though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled) ſhould be imputed unto us: It is only our conſent that brings them home to us, and makes them our ſins; were then theſe thoughts (as you ſuppoſe them) blaſphemies; yet whiles your heart goes not with them, but abhorrs them, and ſtrives againſt them, they may afflict you, they cannot hurt you: As <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid in the like caſe, Birds may fly over our heads, whether we will or no, but they cannot neſtle in our hair unleſſe we permit them. Take heart
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:97700:229"/>
therefore to your ſelf; and be not too much dejected with the wicked ſolicitations of a known enemy: For the redreſſe whereof (as I have not been unacquainted with the like cauſes of complaints) let me preſcribe you a double remedy; Reſolution, and Prayer.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place take up ſtrong reſolutions not to give heed or eare to theſe unreaſonable motions; reſolve rather to ſcorne and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn them upon their firſt intimation, as not worthy of a particular anſwer; For certainly holding chat with them and ſad agitations, and arguing of them, as thoughts meet to receive a ſatisfaction, drawes on their more troubleſome importunity; whereas if they were ſleighted, and diſdainfully turn'd off upon their firſt glimpſe, they would go away aſhamed. Whenſoever therefore any ſuch ſuggeſtions offer themſelves unto you, think with your ſelf: I know whence this comes, it is Satans; let him take it whoſe it is, I will not meddle with it; ſay but in your Saviours words, <hi>Avoid Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>; and divert your thoughts to ſome holy and profitable ſubject, and theſe temptations will by Gods grace ſoon vaniſh.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, apply your ſelf to the remedy of that choſen Veſſel, who when he was buffeted by the meſſenger of Satan, had recourſe to the throne of Grace, and beſought God thriſe, (that is frequently) that he might depart away from him: Whenſoever you ſhall be thus troubled, do you by a ſuddain ejaculation raiſe up your heart to God; and beſeech him to rebuke that evil one, and do not ſo much care to anſwer the Temptation, as to implore the aid of him, who can take off the tempter at pleaſure; who hath an hook in the noſtrils of that Leviathan. Certainly thoſe evil thoughts cannot be more ſwift-winged then our prayers may be, nor ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to our vexation as our prayers ſhall be for our reſcue. Be therefore fervent and affidious in them, and my ſoul for yours the enemy ſhall have no power to harme you. As for your doubt of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the bleſſed Sacrament becauſe of theſe miſconceived blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, it falls alone by what I have already ſaid; The blaſphemies (if they were ſuch) are Satans not yours; Why ſhould you not do your ſelf good, becauſe he would do you a miſchief: In Gods name go on to defie that evil one; and let him take his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to himſelf; and do you goe with cheerfullneſſe and good courage to that Holy Table: as there and thence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to receive new ſtrength againſt all his aſſaults: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p>As we uſe therefore to ſay there cannot be better phyſick to a cholerick body then a ſeaſonable Ague, ſo may I ſay ſafely there can be nothing ſo advantageous to a ſecure heart, as to be ſinſick; for hereby he who before fel in overpleaſing himſelf, begins to diſpleaſe himſelf at his fall: Fire never aſcends ſo high as when it is beaten back with a cool blaſt: Water that runs in a ſmooth level with an inſenſible declination (though an heavy body) yet if it fall low it riſes high again: Much forgiven cauſeth much love; neither had the penitent made an ewer of her eyes, and a towel of her hair for Chriſts feet if ſhe had not found her ſelf more faulty then her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: Had not <hi>Peter</hi> thrice denyed, he had not been graced with that threefold queſtion of his Saviours love; it is an harſh but a true word, Gods Children have cauſe to bleſſe him for nothing more then for their ſins: If that all-wiſe providence have thought good to raiſe up even your forgotten ſins in your face to ſhame you before men, there cannot be a greater argument of his mercy; This bluſhing ſhall avoid eternal confuſion: Envy not at the felicity of the cloſely or gloriouſly guilty; who have at once firm foreheads, and foul bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes; vaunting therefore of their innocence becauſe they can have no accuſers, like wicked harlots who becauſe they were delivered without a midwife, and have made away their ſtolen birth, go cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſtill for maids; nothing can be more miſerable then a ſinners proſperity; this argues him bound over in Gods juſt decree to an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting vengeance, <hi>Wo be to them that laugh here, for they ſhall weep and gnaſh</hi>: Happy is that ſhame that ſhall end in glory.</p>
                  <p>And if the wiſdome of that juſt judge of the world ſhall think fit to ſtrip you of your worldly wealth and outward eſtate, acknowledg his mercy and your gain in this loſs; he ſaw this camels bunch kept you out of the needles eye; he ſaw theſe bels too heavy for that high flight to which he intended you; now ſhall you begin to be truely rich when you can injoy the poſſeſſor of Heaven and Earth; when theſe baſe rivals are ſhut out of doors God ſhall have your whole heart; who were not himſelf, if he were not all-ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>Neither let it lye too heavy upon your heart that your hopefull Sons ſhall inherit nothing from you but ſhame and diſhonour; why
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:97700:231"/>
are you injurious to your ſelf and thoſe you love, your repentance ſhall feoffe upon them more bleſſings then your ſin hath loſt; let poſterity ſay they were the ſons of a penitent Father; this ſtain is waſht off with your tears and their vertue: and for their proviſion, (if the worſt fall) <hi>The Earth is the Lords and the fulneſs thereof,</hi> imagine them born to nothing; we that are more Rich in Children then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate hope well of thoſe veſſels whom we can put forth wel rigged, &amp; well balla'ſt though not wealthy laden: How ſenſibly do you now find that wealth doth not conſiſt in getting much, but well; and that contentment doth not lye in the cofer but in the breaſt; laſtly that all treaſures are droſſe to a good conſcience.</p>
                  <p>For your ſelf; If you be pent up within four wals, and barred both of Sun and Men; make God yours and you cannot complain of reſtraint, or ſolitude: No priſon is too ſtraight for his preſence; Heaven it ſelf would be a priſon without him; your ſerious repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance may win that Society which makes the very Angels bleſſed; this is the way to make him your comforter, your companion, in whoſe preſence is the fulneſs of joy.</p>
                  <p>Shortly, let your thoughts be altogether ſuch as may beſeem a man not unwillingly weaned from this world, and careful only to ſpeed happily in another; We your poor friends can anſwer the kinde reſpects of your proſperity no otherwiſe then with our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for the beſt uſe of your affliction; which ſhall not be wanting from your true and ſorrowful wel-willer</p>

                  <head>A SHORT ANSWER TO THOSE Nine Arguments VVhich are brought againſt the BISHOPS SITTING IN PARLIAMENT.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hoſe reaſons had need to be ſtrong; and the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences hainous that ſhould take away an ancient and hereditary right, eſtabliſhed by law. Theſe are not ſuch,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To trade in ſecular affairs, and to be taken up with them, is indeed a great and juſt hinderance to the exerciſe of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial function; but to meet once in three years in a Parliament for ſome few weeks at the ſame time when we are bound to attend con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation buſineſs, is no ſenſible impediment to our holy calling.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We do indeed promiſe &amp; profeſs when we enter into holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that we will give our ſelves ſo much as in us lies wholly to this vocation; will it therefore follow that we may not upon any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion lend our ſelves to the care of the publick when we are thereunto called? And if this notwithſtanding, we may, yea muſt take moderate care of our houſhold affairs, and the proviſion for our family; why not as well of the Common-wealth?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For ancient Canons of Councells; will they be content to be
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:97700:232"/>
bound by them, who urge them upon us? Or will they admit ſome, and reject others? Or will they admit them where they are contrary to our own laws? Now our <hi>Clarendon Conſtit.</hi> have expreſly, <hi>debent intereſſe omnibus judiciis</hi>: The Canons therefore muſt yield to them, not they to the Canons.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Twenty four Biſhops have dependence upon two Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. When was it otherwiſe? Is it not ſo in all ſubordinations of government? If this be a juſt inconvenience, let all be levelled to an equality, and that ſhall end in a certain confuſion but they ſwear to them Canonicall obedience: True, but it is only <hi>in omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus licitis &amp; honeſtis mandatis:</hi> The ſuppoſition implyed muſt needs ſavour of uncharitableneſs; that the <hi>Metropolitans</hi> will be ſtill apt to require unlawfull things, and the Biſhops will ever baſely ſtoop to a ſervile humoring of them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But they have their places only for their lives; and therefore not fit to have a legiſlative power over the honors, liberties, proprieties of the ſubject. 1. If they have their Biſhopricks but for their lives, yet there are ſcarce any of them that have not ſo much tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall eſtate in fee as may make them no leſs capable of a legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power then many of the houſe of Commons who claim this right. Secondly, is the caſe other now then it hath been all this while? yet for ſo many hundred years there have been good laws, and juſt ſentences given by their concurrence, notwithſtanding this their tenure for Life. 3ly. If they be honeſt and conſcionable though they had their places but for a year, or a day, they would not yield to determine ought unjuſtly: And if diſhoneſt and conſcienceleſs, it is not the perpetuall inheritance of our places that can make our determinations juſt.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If dependencies, and expectations of further preferment lie in our way; why not equally in many Temporall Lords, who are intereſſed in offices, and places in court? why ſhould we be more miſ-carriageable by ſuch poſſibilities or hopes then others? Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, when our age is commonly ſuch, and the charges of removes ſo great that there is ſmall likelyhood of an equall gaining by he change.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. If ſeverall and particular Biſhops have much incroched upon the conſciences of his Majeſties ſubjects, in matter of their propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and liberty; what reaſon is there to impute this unto all? why
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:97700:232"/>
ſhould the innocent be puniſhed for the wrongs of the guilty? Let thoſe who can be convinced of an offence this way undergo a condigne cenſure; Let not an unjuſt prejudice be caſt upon the whole calling for the errors of a few.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. It is not to be expected but the whole number of 26. ſhould be intereſſed in the maintenance of that their Juriſdiction which both the laws of Men, and Apoſtolicall inſtitution hath feoffed them in; why ſhould they not defend their own lawfull and holy calling againſt all unjuſt oppoſition of gainſayers. If their hearts did not aſſure them their ſtation were warrantable and good, they were beaſts if they would hold them; and if their hearts do aſſure them ſo, they were beaſts if they would not defend them: But there are numbers in all the three Kingdomes that crye them down; True, but there are greater numbers for them, perhaps an hundred for one; and if ſome buſie factioniſts of the meaner ſort here about (a body compounded of Separatiſts, Anabaptiſts, Familiſts, and ſuch like ſtuffe) make ſome ſhow and noiſe, yet what are theſe, to the whole Kingdom? Neither do theſe men more oppugne our votes in Parliament, then our ſtations in the Church; ſo as this argument will no leſs hold for no biſhops, then for no votes, as likewiſe that inſtance in the practiſe of <hi>Scotland. Scotland</hi> hath aboliſht Epiſcopacy they ſay; The more pity; let them look, <hi>quo jure,</hi> and what anſwer to make unto that God whoſe ordinance it is: But I had thought it ſhould have been a ſtronger argument; <hi>England</hi> retains Epiſcopacy therefore <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould; then <hi>Scotland</hi> hath aboliſht Epiſcopacy, therefore <hi>England</hi> ſhould do ſo too: Let there be any other Church na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the whole Chriſtian World that hath voluntarily abandoned Epiſcopacy, when it might have continued it; and if their practiſe be herein ſingular, why ſhould not they rather conforme to all the reſt of Chriſtendom, then we to them.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. But the core of all, is, that it ſets too great a diſtance between us, and our Brethren of the Clergy, and ſo nouriſhes pride in us, diſcontentment in them, and diſquietneſs in the Church: An argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that fights equally againſt all our ſuperiority over our Brethren, and againſt our votes here: By this reaſon we muſt be all equall, none ſubordinate; and what order can there be where none is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove other? What is this but old <hi>Korahs</hi> challenge. Ye take too much upon you, wherefore lift ye up your ſelves above the Congregation
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:97700:233"/>
of the Lord: Now; I beſeech you, whether was there more pride in <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> that governed, or in <hi>Corah</hi> and <hi>Dathan</hi> that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured and repined?</p>
                  <p>It is pride then that cauſeth contention, but where is this pride? whether in thoſe that moderately manage a lawfull ſuperiority, or in thoſe that ſcorn and hate to be under goverment? Were thoſe Brethren ſo affected as they ought, they ſhould rather rejoyce that any of their own tribe are advanced to thoſe places wherein they might be capable of doing good offices to them and the Church of God, in ſtead of ſwelling with envy againſt their juſt exaltation, and would feel this honor done to their profeſſion; and not to the perſons.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, what a mean opinion doth this imply to be conceived of us by the ſuggeſters, that we who are old Men, Chriſtian Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, and Divines ſhould have ſo little government of our ſelves as to be puffed up with thoſe poor acceſſions of titular reſpects, which thoſe who are really and hereditarily poſſeſſed of, can weild without any ſuch taint or ſuſpicion of tranſportedneſs.</p>
                  <p>Shortly, in all theſe Nine reaſons there is nothing that may induce an indifferent Man to think there is any juſt ground to exclude Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops from ſitting and voting in Parliament.</p>

                  <head>FOR EPISCOPACY, AND LITURGY.</head>
                  <p>WE cannot be too wary of, or too oppoſite to Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry &amp; Antichriſtianiſm: But let me admoniſh you in the fear of God to take heed that we do not dilate the name and imputation of theſe too farr; for I ſpeak it with juſt ſorrow and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there are ſome well meaning and ſeduced ſouls that are by <hi>Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous</hi> teachers brought into the opinion that the ſacred form of the Goverment of the Church and the holy forms of the publick devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and prayers of the Church and all the favorers of them are worthy to be branded with the title of Popery and Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, my heart bleeds in me to think that that calling which was inſtituted by the Apoſtles themſelves and hath ever ſince continued in the univerſall Church of Chriſt without interruption to this day, ſhould now come under the name of Popery: I ſpeak of the calling; if the perſons of any in this ſtation have been faulty, let them bear their own burden, but that the calling it ſelf ſhould receive this conſtruction in the opinion of well-minded and conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Chriſtians is juſtly moſt lamentable. I beſeech you look back upon the hiſtories of former times, look but upon your Acts and Monuments, and ſee whether any have been more expenſive either of their ink, or their blood againſt the tyranny of Popery and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition then the Biſhops of this Church of <hi>England,</hi> in ſo much as the reverend <hi>Dr. Du Moulin</hi> in his publick Epiſtle profeſſes that the Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> were they to whom this Church is beholden for the liberty and maintenance of the Proteſtant Religion in this
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:97700:234"/>
Kingdom and in this preſent age how many of us have written and are content and ready to bleed for the ſincerity of the Goſpel? If there be any therefore in this holy order whoſe lips have hang'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the onions and garlick, and fleſhpots of <hi>Egypt,</hi> let them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo juſt cenſure; but let the calling, and the zealous and faithfull managers of it be acquitted before God, and Men.</p>
                  <p>For the latter, I ſee and mourn to ſee that many good ſouls are brought into a diſlike and deteſtation of the common prayers of the Church of <hi>England</hi> as meer Maſs and Popery, wo is me that error ſhould prevail ſo farr with good hearts. I beſeech you for Gods ſake and your ſouls ſake be rightly informed in this ſo materiall and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a point.</p>
                  <p>I ſee there is herein a double offence. One of them which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the prayers becauſe they are ſet forms; the other that diſlike them becauſe they are ſuch ſet forms.</p>
                  <p>For the former I beſeech them to conſider ſeriouſly whether they ought to think themſelves wiſer and perfecter then all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of God that ever have been upon the Earth: This I dare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently ſay that ſince God had an eſtabliſhed Church in the World there were ſet forms of devotion: in the Jewiſh Church before and ſince Chriſt, in the Chriſtian Church of all ages; and at this very day all thoſe varieties of Chriſtians in the large circle of Chriſtiano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy they have their ſet forms of prayers which they do and muſt uſe, and in the Reformed Churches both of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> it is no otherwiſe: yea reverend Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf whoſe judgment had wont to ſway with the forwardeſt Chriſtians writing to the Protector of <hi>England, Anno</hi> 1548. hath theſe words, <hi>Quod ad formulam precum attinet &amp; rituum Eccleſiaſticorum valsle prob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ut certa illa extet a qua paſtoribus diſcedere non liceat in functione ſua, &amp;c.</hi> And adding three grave and ſolid reaſons for it, concludes thus: ſo then there ought to be a ſet form of Catechiſm, a ſet form of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Sacraments, and of publick prayers; and why will we caſt off the judgment both of him and all the Divines of the whole Chriſtian World till <hi>Barrow</hi> and <hi>Browne</hi> in our age and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance contradicted it, and run after a conceit that never had any being in the World till within our own memory:</p>
                  <p>For the latter. There are thoſe who could allow ſome form of ſet prayers, but diſlike this of ours as ſavoring of the Pope and
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:97700:234"/>
the Maſs, whence they ſay it is derived; Now I beſeech you Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren as you would avoid the danger of that wo of calling good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and evill good, inform your ſelves throughly of the true State of this buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>Know therefore that the whole Church of God both Eaſtern and Weſtern as it was divided; both the Greek and Latin Church under which this <hi>Iland</hi> was wont to be ranged had their forms of prayer from the begining, which were then holy and Heavenly compiled by the holy Fathers of thoſe firſt times: Afterwards the abuſes and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of popery came in by degrees, as Tranſubſtantiation, Sacrifice of the Maſs, prayers for the dead, prayers to Saints; theſe poyſoned the Church, and vitiated theſe holy forms whiles they continued, but when Reformation came in, divers worthy Proteſtant Divines, whereof ſome were noble Martyrs for religion, were appointed to reviſe that form of ſervice, to purge out all that popiſh leaven that had ſowred them, to reſtore them to their former purity; leaving nothing in that book but that which they found conſonant to godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and pure religion.</p>
                  <p>If any Man will now ſay that our prayer book is taken out of the Maſs, let him know rather that the Maſs was caſt out of our prayer-book into which it was injuriouſly and impiouſly intruded; the good of thoſe prayers are ours in the right of Chriſtians, the evill that was in them let them take as their own.</p>
                  <p>And if it ſhould have been as they imagine; let them know that we have departed from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> but in thoſe things wherein they have departed from Chriſt, what good thing they have is ours ſtill; That ſcripture which they have, That Creed which they profeſs is ours, neither will we part with it for their abuſe.</p>
                  <p>If a peece of Gold be offerd us, will we not take it becauſe it was taken out of the channell? If the Devil have given a confeſſion of Chriſt, and ſaid, I know who thou art even Jeſus the Son of the living God; ſhall not I make this confeſſion becauſe it came out of the Devils mouth? Alas we ſhall be herein very injurious both to our ſelves and to God whoſe every holy truth is.</p>
                  <p>This then is the form which hath been compiled by learned and holy Divines, by bleſſed Martyrs themſelves, who uſed it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably, and bleſſed God for it.</p>
                  <p>But if the quicker eyes of later times have found any thing which
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:97700:235"/>
diſpleaſes them in the phraſes and manners of expreſſion or in ſome rites preſcribed in it, Let them in Gods name await for the reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſentence of that publick authority whereby it was framed and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacted; and let not private perſons preſume to put their hands to the work; which would introduce nothing but palpable confuſion, let all things be done decently, and in order.</p>
                  <p>Shortly my Brethren let us hate Popery to the death but let us not involve within that odious name thoſe holy forms both of adminiſtration, and devotion which are both pleaſing unto God, and agreeable to all Chriſtianity and Godlineſs.</p>

                  <p>I Have long held my peace, and meant to have done ſo ſtill, but now like to <hi>Croeſus</hi> his mute Son, I muſt break ſilence; I humbly beſeech your Lordſhips to give me leave, to take this too juſt occaſion to move your Lordſhips to take into your deep, and ſerious conſideration, the woful, and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition of the poor Church of <hi>England,</hi> your dear Mother; My Lords, this was not wont to be her ſtile, we have heretofore talkt of the famous and flouriſhing Church of <hi>England,</hi> but now your Lordſhips muſt give me leave to ſay, that the poor Church of <hi>England</hi> humbly proſtrates her ſelf (next after his ſacred Majeſty) at your Lordſhips feet, and humbly craves your compaſſion and preſent aid.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, It is a foul and dangerous inſolence, this which is now complained of to you, but it is but one of a hundred of thoſe which have been of late done to this Church and Government. The Church of <hi>England,</hi> as your Lordſhips cannot chooſe but know, hath been and is miſerably infeſted on both ſides, with Papiſts on the one ſide, and Schiſmaticks on the other; The Pſalmiſt hath of old diſtinguiſht the enemies of it, into wild Boars out of the Wood, and little Foxes out of the Burroughs; The one whereof goes about to root up the very foundation of Religion, the other to crop the branches, and bloſſomes and cluſters thereof, both of them conſpire the utter ruine &amp; devaſtation of it; As for the former of them; I do perceive a great deal of good zeal for the remedy and ſuppreſſion of them; and I do heartily congratulate it, and bleſſe God for it, and beſeech him
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:97700:236"/>
to proſper it, in thoſe hands that ſhall undertake and proſecute it; but for the other give me leave to ſay, I do not finde many that are ſenſible of the danger of it, which yet in my apprehenſion is very great and apparent; Alas my Lords, I beſeech you to conſider what it is; that there ſhould be in <hi>London,</hi> and the Suburbs and Liberties, no fewer then fourſcore Congregations of ſeveral Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as I have been too credibly informed, inſtructed by Guides fit for them, Coblers, Taylors, Feltmakers and ſuch like traſh, which all are taught to ſpit in the face of their Mother the Church of England; and to defye and revile her government; From hence have iſſued thoſe dangerous aſſaults of our Church Governours; From hence that inundation of baſe and ſcurrilous libels and pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets, wherewith we have been of late overborne, in which Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts and Prelates like Oxen in a yoke are ſtill matched together; O my Lords, I beſeech you that you will be ſenſible of this great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity: Do but look upon theſe reverend perſons: Do not your Lordſhips ſee here ſitting upon theſe benches, thoſe that have ſpent their time, their ſtrength, their bodies and lives, in preaching down, in writing down Popery? and which would be ready (if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion were offred) to ſacrifice all their old blood that remains to the maintenance of that truth of God, which they have taught and written, and ſhall we be thus deſpightfully ranged with them, whom we do thus profeſſedly oppoſe; but alas this is but one of thoſe many ſcandalous aſperſions, and intolerable affronts that are daily caſt upon us. Now whither ſhould we in this caſe have recourſe for a needful and ſeaſonable redreſſe? The arme of the Church is alas now ſhort and ſinewleſs, it is the interpoſing of your authority that muſt reſcue us. You are the Eldeſt ſons of your dear Mother the Church, and therefore moſt fit &amp; moſt able to vindicate her wrongs, you are <hi>amici Sponſae,</hi> give me leave therefore in the bowels of Chriſt humbly to beſeech your Lordſhips to be tenderly ſenſible of theſe woful and dangerous conditions of the times. And if the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church of <hi>England</hi> be unlawful and unfit, abandon and diſclaim it, but if otherwiſe uphold and maintain it. Otherwiſe if theſe lawleſs outrages be yet ſuffred to gather head, who knowes where they will end? My Lords, if theſe men may with impunity, and freedom, thus bear down Eccleſiaſtical authority, it is to be feared they will not reſt there, but will be ready to affront
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:97700:236"/>
civil power too: Your Lordſhips know that the <hi>Jack Straws,</hi> and <hi>Cades,</hi> and <hi>Watt Tylers</hi> of former times, did not more cry down Learning then Nobility: and thoſe of your Lordſhips that have read the hiſtory of the Anabaptiſtical tumults at <hi>Munster</hi> will need no other Item, let it be enough to ſay that many of theſe Sectaries are of the ſame profeſſion: Shortly therefore let me humbly move your Lordſhips to take theſe dangers and miſeries of this poor Church deeply to heart, and upon this occaſion to give order for the ſpeedy redreſſing of theſe horrible inſolencies, and for the ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of that deluge of libellous invectives, wherewith we are thus impetuouſly overflown; Which in all due ſubmiſſion, I humbly preſent to your Lordſhips wiſe, and religious conſideration.</p>

                  <head>A SPEECH IN PARLIAMENT, In Defence of the CANONS MADE IN CONVOCATION.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>My Lords,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> cannot chooſe but know that whoſoever riſes up in this cauſe muſt ſpeak with the diſadvantage of much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice; and therefore I do humbly crave your Lordſhips beſt conſtruction, were it (my Lords) that ſome few doubting perſons were to be ſatisfied in ſome ſcruples about matter of the Canons, there might have been ſome life in the hope of prevailing; but now that we are borne down with ſuch a torrent of generall and reſolute contradiction, we yield; but yet give us leave I beſeech you ſo to yield that poſterity may not ſay we have willingly betraid our own innocence. Firſt therefore let us plead to your Lordſhips and the World, that to abate the edge of that illegality which is objected to us, it was our obedience that both aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled and kept us together for the making of Synodicall acts. We had the great Seal of <hi>England</hi> for it, ſeconded by the judgments of the oracles of law and juſtice; and upon theſe the command of our ſuperiour to whom we have ſworn and owe canonical obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:97700:237"/>
Now in this caſe, what ſhould we do (Was it for us to judg of the great ſeal of <hi>England</hi>; or to judg of our Judges (alas we are not for the law, but for the Goſpell) or to diſobey that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which was to be ever ſacred to us, I beſeech your Lordſhips put your ſelves a while in to our condition, had the caſe been yours, what would you have done? If we obey not, we are rebels to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; if we obey we are cenſured for illegall procedures? Where are we now, my Lords? It is an old rule of <hi>Caſuiſts, nemo tenetur eſſe perplexus,</hi> Free us one way or other; and ſhew us whether we muſt rather hazard cenſure, or incurr diſobedience. In the next place give us leave to plead our good intentions; ſince we muſt make new Canons. I perſwade my ſelf we all came (I am ſure I can ſpeak for one) with honeſt and zealous deſires to do God and his Church good ſervice, and expected to have received great thanks both of Church and Common-wealth; for your Lordſhips ſee that the main drift of thoſe Canons was to repreſs and confine the indiſcreet and lawleſs diſcourſes of ſome either ignorant, or paraſiticall, I am ſure offenſive Preachers to ſuppreſs the growth of Socinianiſm, Popery, Separatiſm, to redreſs ſome abuſes of Eccleſiaſtical courts and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; In all which I dare ſay your Lordſhips do heartily concurr with them; And if in the manner of expreſſion there have been any fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings I ſhall humbly beſeech your Lordſhips that thoſe may not be too much ſtood upon where the main ſubſtance is well meant; and in it ſelf profitable. In the third place give me leave to put your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips in mind of the continuall practiſe of the Chriſtian Church, ſince the firſt Synod of the Apoſtles (<hi>Act.</hi> 15.) to this preſent day; wherein I ſuppoſe it can never be ſhowed that ever any Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Canons made by the Biſhops and Clergy in Synods, generall, nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, provinciall, were either offered or required to be confirmed by Parliaments: Emperours and Princes, by whoſe authority thoſe Synods were called, have ſtill given their power to the ratification and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of them; and none others; and if you pleaſe to look into the times within the ken of memory or ſomewhat beyond it, <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods</hi> Conſtitutions, what Parliaments confirmed? The Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Canons of King <hi>James</hi> were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tendred to the Parliament for confirmation; and yet have ſo far obtained hitherto, that the government of the Church was by them ſtill regulated; compare I beſeech you thoſe of K. <hi>James</hi> with the
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:97700:238"/>
preſent, your Lordſhips ſhall find them many, peremptory, reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, ſtanding upon their own grounds, in points much harder of digeſtion then theſe which are but few, and only ſeconds to former conſtitutions: if therefore in this we have erred, ſurely the whole Chriſtian Church of all places and times hath erred with us; either therefore we ſhall have too good company in the cenſure, or elſe we ſhall be excuſed.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly give me leave to urge the authority of theſe Canons; in which regard if I might without offence ſpeak it, I might ſay that the complainants have not (under correction) laid a right ground of their accuſation; They ſay we have made Canons and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; alas my Lords we have made none.</p>
                  <p>We neither did, nor could make Canons, more then they can make laws; The Canons are ſo to the Church as laws are for the Common-wealth; now they do but <hi>rogare legem,</hi> they do not <hi>ferre</hi> or <hi>ſancire legem,</hi> that is only for the King to do, it is <hi>le Roy le Veult,</hi> that of bills makes laws; ſo was it for us to do in matter of Canons, we might propound ſome ſuch conſtitutions as we ſhould think might be uſefull; but when we have done we ſend them to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, who peruſing them <hi>cum aviſamento Conſilii ſui,</hi> and approving them puts life into them, and of dead propoſitions makes them Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons; as therefore the laws are the Kings laws, and not ours; ſo are the Canons the Kings Canons, and not the Clergies, Think thus of them, and then draw what concluſions you pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>As for that pecuniary buſineſs of our contribution wherein we are ſaid to have trenched upon the liberty of ſubjects and propriety of goods; I beſeech your Lordſhips do but ſee the difference of times, we had a precedent for it; The ſame thing was done in Qu. <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi> time in a mulct of 3 s. the pound and that after the end of the Parliament, with the ſame clauſes of Suſpenſion, Sequeſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Deprivation, without noiſe of any exception which now is cryed down for an unheard of incroachment; how legall it may be I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute not, and did then make bold to move; but let the guide of that example and the zeal that we had to the ſupply of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties neceſſities excuſe us a <hi>tanto</hi> at leaſt; if having given theſe as ſubſidies ſitting the Parliament, and the bill being drawn up for the confirmation of the Parliament, we now, upon the unhappy diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it as loath to retract ſo neceſſary a graunt we were willing to have it continued to his Majeſties uſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="431" facs="tcp:97700:238"/>But, my Lords, if I may have leave to ſpeak my own thoughts, I ſhall freely ſay that whereas there are three general concernments both of perſons and cauſes, merely Eccleſiaſtical, merely Temporal, or mixt of both Eccleſiaſtical and temporall; as it is fit, the Church by her Synode ſhould take cognizance of, and order for the firſt whcih is merely Eccleſiaſtical, ſo next under his Majeſty, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould have the power of ordering the other; but in the mean time, my Lords, where are we? The Canons of the Church both late and former are pronounced to be void and forceleſs, the Church is a garden or vineyard incloſed; the laws and conſtitutions of it are as the wall, or hedg, if theſe be caſt open, in what State are we: ſhall the enemies of this Church have ſuch an advantage of us, as to ſay, we are a lawleſs Church, or ſhall all Men be left looſe to their licentious freedom, God in Heaven forbid: Hitherto we have been quietly and happily governed by thoſe former Canons, the extent whereof we have not I hope (and for ſome of us) I am confident, we have not exceeded; why ſhould we not be ſo ſtill? Let theſe late Canons ſleep ſince you will have it ſo, till we awake them, which ſhall not be till Dooms-day, and let us be where we were, and regulate our ſelves by thoſe conſtitutions which were quietly ſubmitted to on all hands, and for this which is paſt, ſince that which we did was out of our true obedience, and with honeſt and godly intentions and according to the Univerſal practiſe of all Chriſtian Churches, and with the full power of his Majeſties au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, let it not be imputed to us as any way worthy of your Lordſhips cenſure.</p>

                  <head>A SPEECH in PARLIAMENT, Concerning the power of BISHOPS IN SECULAR THINGS.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lords this is the ſtrangeſt bill that ever I heard ſince I was admitted to ſit under this roof, for it ſtrikes at the very fabrick and compoſition of this houſe; at the ſtyle of all lawes; and therefore were it not that it comes from ſuch a recommendation it would not, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, undergo any long conſideration; but coming to us from ſuch hands, It cannot but be worthy of your beſt thoughts; and truly for the main ſcope of the bill I ſhall yield it moſt willingly, that Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical and ſacred perſons ſhould not ordinarily be taken up with ſecular affairs.</p>
                  <p>The Miniſter is called <hi>Vir Dei,</hi> a Man of God; he may not be <hi>Vir Seculi,</hi> he may lend himſelf to them upon occaſion, he may not give himſelf over purpoſely to them: Shortly, he may not ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend worldly things as that he do neglect divine things. This we gladly yield; matters of juſtice therefore are not proper, as in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary trade, for our function, and by my conſent ſhall be as in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally waved and deſerted, which for my part I never have med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with but in a charitable way; with no profit, but ſome char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge to my ſelf, whereof I ſhall be glad to be eaſed: <hi>Tractent fabrilia fabri,</hi> as the old word is: But if any man ſhall hence think to infer, that ſome ſpiritual perſon, may not occaſionally be in a ſpecial ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his King or Countrey; &amp; when he is ſo required by his Prince, give his advice in the urgent affairs of the Kingdome (which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is the main point driven at) is ſuch an inconſequence as I dare boldly ſay cannot be made good, either by divinity or reaſon; by the lawes either of God or man; whereas the contrary may be proved and inforced by both.</p>
                  <p>As for the grounds of this bill, that the Miniſters duty is ſo great that it is able to take up the whole man, and the Apoſtle ſaith 'tis

                     </gap>, who is ſufficient for theſe things, and that he who warfares to God, ſhould not intangle himſelf with this world, it is a ſufficient and juſt conviction of thoſe who would divide themſelves betwixt God and the World, and beſtow any main part of their time upon ſecular affairs; but it hath no operation at all upon this tenet which we have in hand; that a man dedicate to God, may not ſo much as when he is required, caſt a glance of his eye, or ſome minutes of time, or ſome motions of his tongue upon the publick buſineſs of his King and Countrey.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that expect this from us may as well and upon the ſame reaſon hold that a miniſter muſt have no family at all, or if he have one, muſt not care for it; yea that he muſt have no body to tend, but be all Spirit: My Lords, we are men of the ſame compoſition with others, and our breeding hath been accordingly, we cannot have lived in the World but we have ſeen it, and obſerved it too, and our long experience and converſation both in Men and in books, cannot but have put ſomething into us for the good of others; and now having a double capacity; <hi>qua cives, qua Eccleſiaſtici</hi>; as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the common wealth; as Miniſters and Governours of the Church, we are ready to do our beſt ſervice in both; one of them is no way incompatible with the other; yea the ſubjects of them both are ſo united with the Church and Commonwealth, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſevered: yea ſo, as that, not the one is in the other, but one is the other, is both: ſo as the ſervices which we do upon theſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to the Comonwealth are inſeparable from our good offices to the Church: ſo as upon this ground there is no reaſon of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</p>
                  <p>If ye ſay that our ſitting in Parliament takes up much time which we might have imployed in our ſtudies or pulpits; conſider I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you; that whiles you have a Parliament, we muſt have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation; and that our attendance upon that will call for the ſame expenſe of time which we afford to this ſervice, ſo as herein we have neither got nor loſt.</p>
                  <p>But I fear it is not on ſome hands the tender regard of the full ſcope to our calling that is ſo much here ſtood upon; as the conceit of too much honour that is done us in taking up the room of Peers, and voting in this high Court; for ſurely thoſe that are averſe from our votes, yet could be content we ſhould have place upon the wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks;
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:97700:240"/>
and could alow us ears, but not tongues. If this be the matter <hi>I</hi> beſeech your Lordſhips to conſider that this honour is not done to us but our profeſſion; which (what ever we be in our ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſons) can not eaſily be capable of too much reſpect from your Lordſhips, <hi>Non tibi ſed Iſidi,</hi> as he ſaid of old: Neither is this any new grace that is put upon our calling; (which if it were now to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin might perhaps be juſtly grudged to our unworthyneſs) but it is an antient right and inheritance inherent in our ſtation: No leſs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient then theſe walls wherein we ſit; yea more; before ever there were Parliaments, in the <hi>Magna Conſilia</hi> of the Kingdome we had our places; and as for my predeceſſors ever ſince the Conquerours time, <hi>I</hi> can ſhow your Lordſhips a juſt catalogue of them that have ſat before me here; and truely though I have juſt cauſe to be mean in mine own eyes, yet why or wherein there ſhould be more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs in me then the reſt, that <hi>I</hi> ſhould be ſtript of that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg which they ſo long injoyed though there were no law to hold me here, <hi>I</hi> cannot ſee, or confeſſe. What reſpects of honour have been put upon the prime Clergy of old both by Pagans, and Jewes, and Chriſtians, and what are ſtill both within Chriſtendom and vvithout, <hi>I</hi> ſhall not need to urge, it is enough to ſay, this of ours is not meerly arbitrary, but ſtands ſo firmely eſtabliſhed by law and cuſtome, that <hi>I</hi> hope it neither will nor can be removed except you will ſhake thoſe foundations which <hi>I</hi> believe you deſire to hold firme and inviolable.</p>
                  <p>Shortly then, my Lords, the church craves no new honour from you, and juſtly hopes you will not be guilty of pulling down the old: as you are the eldeſt ſons, and next under his Majeſty the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble patrons of the Church, ſo ſhe expects, and beſeeches you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her into your tendereſt care, ſo to order her affairs that ye leave her to poſterity in no worſe caſe then you found her. It is a true word of <hi>Damaſus, Uti vileſcit nomen epiſcopi, omnis ſtatua perturbatur Eccleſiae</hi>; If this be ſuffered, the miſery will be the Churches, the diſhonour &amp; blurre of the act in future ages will be yours. To ſhut up therefore, let us be taken off from all ordinary trade of ſecular imployments, and if you pleaſe abridge us of intermeddling with matters of common ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, but leave us poſſeſſed of thoſe places and priviledges in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which our predeceſſors have ſo long and peaceably injoyed.</p>
