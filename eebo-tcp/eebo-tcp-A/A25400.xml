            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the most Reverend <hi>Prelate,</hi> the <hi>Lord Bishop</hi> of <hi>Winchester, Peter Moulin</hi> wisheth all health and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</head>
            <p>THat <hi>Honorable man,</hi> your <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor,</hi> was taken hence, not without great damage both to the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi> The King lost a most wise <hi>Counseller,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> a faithfull <hi>Pastor</hi>; but I a <hi>Patron</hi> and a <hi>friend</hi>; who, though he was most carefull and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of my good yet, oblig'd me more by his <hi>Virtues,</hi> then his <hi>benefits.</hi> I have his Letters by me, which he wrote to me when he was sick, and his recovery was almost desperate; the very sight wherof doth exceedingly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict me. But yet my grief was not a little eas'd, when I heard that <hi>you</hi> succeeded in his room, whose <hi>learning</hi> I long since admir'd, and of whose <hi>good affection</hi> I had great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65108:3"/>
when I was with you. Indeed, his most judicious <hi>Majestie</hi> did not stick long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his choice. You were even then design'd his <hi>Successor,</hi> in the judgment of all who knew the wisdome of the <hi>King.</hi> May it, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech <hi>God,</hi> prove happy and fortunate to <hi>your self,</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Kingdom.</hi> May <hi>He</hi> grant <hi>you,</hi> with increase of <hi>Honor,</hi> increase of <hi>Virtue,</hi> and a fresh and lively old age: That <hi>his</hi> most <hi>Gracious Majestie</hi> may long enjoy <hi>you</hi> for <hi>his Counseller,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> daily reap more and more fruits of <hi>your industry</hi> and <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wrote a Book touching the <hi>Calling</hi> of <hi>Pastors,</hi> wherin some passages greiv'd the soul of <hi>your most wise King,</hi> as if they were averse to the Office of <hi>Episcopacy.</hi> But, indeed, on the other side, our Countrymen complain not a little, that I vndertook the cause of <hi>Bishops</hi>; and condemnd <hi>Aerius,</hi> who, in a matter an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, and universally receivd, durst op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose himself against the Practise of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik Church.</hi> And they take it in ill part, that I said, that it was generally receivd in the <hi>Church,</hi> even from the <hi>first successors</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> that, among the <hi>Presbyters</hi> of a <hi>City,</hi> some one should have the preeminence and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65108:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be call'd the <hi>Bishop,</hi> But, though there be many things in my Book, which the <hi>King</hi> set a dash of <hi>his</hi> dislike upon, which, as all things els, <hi>he</hi> observed wisely and with an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sharpness of wit, yet, <hi>Three things</hi> there are, which specially offend <hi>Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> is, that, I said, that the <hi>Names</hi> of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
               <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> are promiscuously ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> for one and the same.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second,</hi> that, I affirm'd, that there is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> but one and the same <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and <hi>Bishop.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Third,</hi> and that the greatest, is, that I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> think the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>Priority</hi> or <hi>Superiority</hi> of Bishops, not to be of <hi>Divine Right,</hi> nor a point of <hi>Faith,</hi> but to be a thing wherein the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> vsed her liberty and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, when she judged the Preeminence of <hi>One</hi> to be fitter for the mantaining of <hi>Order</hi> and conserving of Peace, and that <hi>Vnity may</hi> well be kept whole and intire between <hi>Churches,</hi> though they differ upon that point.</p>
            <p>I confess, these things were wrote by me: which, lest they be drawn to a wrong sense, or be taken in the worser part, take, I pray,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65108:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
breifly my meaning in them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> I said, indeed, that the <hi>Names</hi> of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> were taken for all one in the <hi>New Testament:</hi> But I thought not that the <hi>Dignity</hi> of the <hi>Bishop</hi> was less'ned thereby, since I spake only of the <hi>Name,</hi> not of the <hi>Office</hi> only: and I have (beside clear places of Scripture) the consent not only of <hi>Hierom</hi> the <hi>Presbyter,</hi> but also of the most famous <hi>Bishops</hi> of the <hi>Ancient Church, Chrysostom, Ambrose, Theodoret,</hi> who took it not as a wrong to them, or that any thing was aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of their honor, if it were beleeved that the <hi>Names</hi> of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> were at first used in the same sense.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> That the <hi>Order,</hi> indeed, of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter</hi> was one and the same, that I said: For so did the <hi>Ancient Church</hi> ever think; and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> thinks so, to this day: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be in <hi>that Church</hi> an incredible difference betwixt the <hi>pomp</hi> of the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and the <hi>meaness</hi> of the <hi>Priests.</hi> Thence it is that in the <hi>Roman Pontifical</hi> there is set down the <hi>Consecration</hi> of <hi>Bishops,</hi> but not the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of them. Indeed, <hi>Order</hi> is one thing, a <hi>Degree</hi> another: for men of one and the same <hi>Order</hi> may differ in <hi>Degree</hi> and Dignity; even
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65108:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as among <hi>Bishops</hi> the <hi>Degree</hi> of <hi>Archbishops</hi> is the more eminent.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, that this <hi>Episcopal Degree</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
               <hi>Prerogative</hi> is by <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> not by <hi>Divine Right,</hi> I confess it was said by me. For beside that to speak otherwise then I thought, had not been the part of an vpright honest man, <hi>you,</hi> according to <hi>your</hi> wonted goodness, will easily judg, that a <hi>French man,</hi> living vnder the <hi>Polity</hi> of the <hi>French Church,</hi> could not speak otherwise, but he must incur the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of our <hi>Synods,</hi> and vnder the danger (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) of degrading, be forced to a recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. For to think that <hi>our Churches</hi> do err in points of <hi>Faith,</hi> and in that which is of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right</hi> were, questionles, to brand them with the note of <hi>Heresy,</hi> and to shake the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of many weak ones.</p>
            <p>Truly, I came very vnwillingly to the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this Book, but <hi>our Church</hi> requiring it, and lately enforcing me, for to stop the insolency of our Adversaries, who in this point insult over vs out of all temper, and speak of vs as of so many doltish mushrums, newly sprung out of the earth, and as of a company of base fellows who by force and tumult had got the Pulpit. But, howsoever,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65108:5"/>
I think, I have kept such a temper, that, in defending our own, I have not struck at your government; nor by immoderate affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to a part have inclined, more then was meet, to either side. Nor did I ever mention the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>England</hi> with out due honor.</p>
            <p>These things I thought fit to write to <hi>you, Great Sir,</hi> by whom I chiefly desire my papers may be approved. I had sent <hi>my Book</hi> to <hi>you</hi> before now, but that I was told by divers <hi>you</hi> vnderstood not <hi>French.</hi> Now I send it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause; since <hi>you</hi> enjoy a more frequent and neerer presence of <hi>His Majestie,</hi> I doubt not but <hi>He</hi> may have some speech with you about it, and use <hi>you</hi> as an umpire in the cause. And I shal most willingly stand to <hi>your</hi> iudgment; well knowing that the most learned are ever the most can did; and hoping that <hi>you</hi> wil not lauce too deep whatever may be salved with a fair interpretation. So think of me, as of a man <hi>with whom the Authority of Antiquity shalbe ever in great esteem</hi>; and who shall think my self sufficiently arm'd against al opposite judgments, if <hi>you</hi> shal not vtterly disapprove what I have writ. <hi>God</hi> preserve <hi>you, Great Prelate.</hi> Farewell.</p>

               <p>I Had wrote these in the begining of <hi>March,</hi> and was about to send them presently; when, lo, the indisposition of the <hi>King,</hi> in point of health, made me lay them by, and hindred my sending of them. This sickness, contracted first by grief, for the death of <hi>his</hi> most <hi>dear Consort,</hi> our most <hi>Gracious Queen,</hi> and the neglect of all care of <hi>his</hi> body upon that greif, ended at last in a diseas; a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eas, indeed, so intricat and doubtfull, that the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians themselves were at a stand what the event would be. Wherby I forgat that I wrote, and so omitted to send to <hi>you.</hi> For all I had to do was to fall to my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, with many moe, who were sore perplexed, as then in jeopardy, for a most <hi>Gracious King.</hi> But <hi>God</hi> lookd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and restord <hi>Him</hi> to us, &amp; in <hi>Him</hi> us to our selves.

               <p>Now concerning <hi>your Book. You</hi> write that some pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages therin greivd the <hi>Kings</hi> Soul. And no wonder.

               <p>What could they, who lately made all the stirrs among us, mutter more, possibly? Then, that 1. the <hi>Name is taken confusedly.</hi> that 2. <hi>the Thing is not distinct.</hi> 3. Finally, that <hi>it is a Human invention</hi>: being setled by man may be unsetled, and so stands or falls at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Commonwealth. <hi>These Dictats</hi> are too well known to the <hi>King: He</hi> hath been long usd to them: They have long since on all hands been rounded in <hi>His</hi> ears. <hi>He</hi> knows that there are still among us such, as will from <hi>your</hi> writings presently take a new occasion, perhaps, not to pluck up this <hi>Order</hi> of ours, that for so many ages hath taken root but, surely, to defame and calumniat it.</p>
               <p>And this so much the rather, because, at one and the same time, not by agreement, I beleeve, but yet as though vpon a compact, lo, one <hi>Bucer,</hi> a fellow not hurt, nor medled with by any, in a very unseasonable time, set forth a <hi>Book</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> as it were, of the same argument.

Wherfore, if the <hi>King</hi> set a dash of dislike upon those passages, take it not ill: I dare say, <hi>He</hi> had rather set <hi>many asterisks</hi> of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, then <hi>one dash</hi> of dislike, specially upon what is <hi>your.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>your</hi> own equity. <hi>You</hi> were for manteining of <hi>Your Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Government,</hi> and the repressing of your adversaries insolency: should you not do it, you should incurr the <hi>censure of your Synod,</hi> and be forced either to <hi>recant,</hi> or fear to be <hi>degraded.</hi> In this <hi>We</hi> pardon <hi>you,</hi> and demand the like pardon from <hi>you</hi>; that it may be lawfull for <hi>us</hi> also to defend <hi>our Government,</hi> as becometh upright honest men. For <hi>we</hi> likewise have froward adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and there are consciences, too, among <hi>us,</hi> which <hi>we</hi> may not suffer to be shaken or undermind, as though they liv'd under <hi>another form of Church Government,</hi> then was from the begining, even from the very times of the <hi>Apostles.</hi> And we are ready, if need be, and occasion shall serve, to make this good to the <hi>whole Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How I wish therfore, that <hi>you</hi> had not so much as touchd upon <hi>our Church Government.</hi> For who put <hi>you</hi> upon it? <hi>You</hi> might have turnd <hi>your</hi> weapons against <hi>those enemys</hi> (you speak of) and never have jerkt at <hi>vs.</hi> Theres no such complication of <hi>ours</hi> with <hi>yours,</hi> but that you might easily have pass'd by <hi>ours</hi> with silence, And

Wherfore, if hereafter <hi>you</hi> shall go about any thing in the like kind, pray remember this my advice, which proceeds from a very good will to <hi>you</hi>; I knowing that the <hi>King</hi> is well affected to <hi>you</hi>; that <hi>he</hi> hath deserved well of <hi>you,</hi> (nor will <hi>you</hi> deny it,) and, I hope, will for the future de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve better.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Concerning <hi>those Three points,</hi> if you demand (as you do) what I think, I shall give you here this ingenuous answer; That the <hi>Names</hi> of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken promiscuously in Holy <hi>Scriptures</hi>: that at first, there was not so great force in the <hi>Words,</hi> I shal easily grant you. Nor did <hi>his</hi> Majestie regard so much, <hi>what</hi> you said, as <hi>to what purpose</hi>; as <hi>what others</hi> would catch from thence; who, both in other parts, &amp; here among us, too, are not rightly affected to <hi>this our order</hi>: that these things were spoke <hi>to this purpose,</hi> as if the <hi>Names</hi> being <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuous,</hi> the <hi>Things</hi> themselves were <hi>so</hi> also. For to what end is it, of what concernment, to speak of <hi>Words</hi> taken <hi>confusedly,</hi> when the <hi>Things</hi> are <hi>distinct.</hi> No man, lightly, carps at the <hi>Name,</hi> but he that wisheth not very well to the <hi>Thing</hi> also.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And yet nothing here hath befallen <hi>Bishops,</hi> which hath not befallen those <hi>other Orders</hi> also. For, in those very places, in those very Authors whom you name, it is said in like manner also of <hi>Deacons.</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>S Chrysost in ed Philip c.</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Even a Bishop is called a Deacon: wherupon S. Paul, writing to Timothy, said to him, though a Bishop, Fullfill thy Deaconry.</hi> From thence you may gather, that the <hi>Names</hi> of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Deacon</hi> are taken for the same. Nay, the very <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves call themselves sometimes <hi>Presbyters,</hi> sometimes <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,</hi> and so their whole Office a <hi>Deaconry</hi>; and yet is not <hi>Deacon</hi> or <hi>Presbyter</hi> the same that <hi>Apostle.</hi> Why therfore
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65108:7"/>
did you not add that too, that it might appear that the <hi>other</hi> suffered as much as <hi>Bishops:</hi> and that, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not only the <hi>names</hi> of <hi>Bishops,</hi> but of <hi>other Orders</hi> also were taken, in like manner, <hi>promiscuously</hi>; wheras the <hi>Things,</hi> the <hi>Offices</hi> themselves were distinct.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wheras, then, in those very places, where the <hi>Fathers</hi> speak so, [<hi>That then they communicated in Names</hi>] <hi>they</hi> presently apply a remedy, and give this <hi>item,</hi> that the <hi>Things</hi> themselves are otherwise. And instantly add [<hi>Afterward the proper name was given to each; of Bishop to a Bishop, of Presbyter to a Presbyter.</hi>] By the rule of speech then, who would urge the <hi>common</hi> name, when the <hi>proper</hi> had taken place? For no body would now call a <hi>King,</hi> a <hi>Tyrant</hi>; or a <hi>Souldier,</hi> [<hi>Latro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem</hi>] as of old they were wont, a <hi>Robber:</hi> neither, sure, would they call a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> a <hi>Bishop</hi>; as when S. <hi>Hierom</hi> wrote, had he called himself <hi>Bishop,</hi> and <hi>S. Augustine Presbyter,</hi> you know, he would have been laughed at for his pains.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Add further, that in those very places wherin the <hi>Fathers</hi> speak so, before they speak, they are forced [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] to object by way of exception concerning the use of <hi>names,</hi> and to premise some what that should put the thing out of question. S. <hi>Chrysostom; What mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this? were there then more Bishops of one &amp; the same city? by no means.</hi> No, not then when S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote. <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret; It could not be, that many Bishops should be Pastors of one City.</hi> S. <hi>Hierom; There could not be many Bishops in one City.</hi> S. <hi>Ambrose; God appointed several Bishops over several Citys.</hi> So that they do cleerly shew, the <hi>Offices</hi> were then <hi>distinct,</hi> when they make the inference touching the <hi>name.</hi> I collect then; how ere it was for the <hi>names,</hi> at first; Be it they then neglected the <hi>Propriety</hi> of speech, yet that even then, there was but <hi>one Bishop,</hi> but <hi>one Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:65108:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in <hi>one City.</hi> And this holdeth among <hi>us,</hi> even at this day; but doth it so among <hi>you</hi>? Thus if you had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facd touching the <hi>Thing</hi> it self, and had afterward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd touching the <hi>names,</hi> (though to what end is it to make any stir about the <hi>name,</hi> when we are agreed on the <hi>thing</hi>?) that they were (a little while) taken <hi>one</hi> for <hi>another</hi>; and had not spoken so loosly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the promiscuous use of the <hi>names, his Majestie</hi> would not, I beleeve, have set <hi>his</hi> dash of dislike upon that passage.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> The next is touching the <hi>Order.</hi> Where, I pray, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, whether they be to be called <hi>One</hi> and <hi>the same Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> whose <hi>Offices</hi> are not <hi>one</hi> and <hi>the same.</hi> But that they are not the <hi>same Offices,</hi> even they who less favour the <hi>Episcopal Order</hi> do confess, in that <hi>they</hi> ever except <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> Again, whether they be to be called <hi>One</hi> and <hi>the same Order,</hi> wherin there is not <hi>One</hi> and <hi>the same,</hi> but a <hi>new</hi> and <hi>distinct Imposition of hands.</hi> For, that in <hi>all Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> there was <hi>Imposition of hands</hi> upon <hi>Bishops,</hi> no man, I think, will deny. And, whether the <hi>Antient Church</hi> were of this opinion, let <hi>Isidore</hi> be the witness, who <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Etym.</hi> 7. 12.</note> in plain words calls it the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Bishoprick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the Schole, indeed, if you referr it, they do not agree among themselves.

For what a thing were this, if that, from whence <hi>Ordination,</hi> and so all other <hi>Orders</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, should it self not be an <hi>Order</hi>?</p>

that it cannot be denyed, but their <hi>Deeds</hi> (of which we are certain) not only their <hi>Words,</hi> or <hi>Writings,</hi> are of <hi>Divine Right.</hi> And not only those things of which S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>

Which should I do, <hi>you your self</hi> would account me a sensless ungracious fellow, and worthy to be spit upon by all. But enough of this: For an overlabored Defence, specially to an understanding man, and in a clear and manifest point, is altogether needless. <hi>God</hi> preserve <hi>you,</hi> and prosper <hi>your</hi> endeavours, that they may redound to the edification of the <hi>Church.</hi> Farewell.</p>

               <p>THe Post was not yet gone, he staied here a day or two, but he had these letters, here inclosed, sealed up as they are; when, lo, I received your Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, by the hands of S. <hi>William Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,</hi> Agent for the <hi>King,</hi> lately come from you. I presently recalled my <hi>former,</hi> yet opened them not, but, as they were, inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>them</hi> in <hi>these.</hi> For I would not so trespass as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the same fault again; but rather make amends for my <hi>former tardiness</hi> with the <hi>quickness</hi> of <hi>this</hi> Answer. You shall therfore with my <hi>First</hi> receive these <hi>Second</hi>; together with my thanks for both: but [<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>] the <hi>First Second,</hi> as it were; to wit, in these <hi>Second</hi> Letters my <hi>First</hi> thanks now, and in the <hi>First</hi> my <hi>Second,</hi> (as it falls out.) Thanks, I say, both for that your <hi>Book, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly</hi> sent; and this <hi>Later,</hi> shortly, as I hope, to be sent. For S. <hi>William Beecher</hi> will deny either that it was bound (when he came thence) or els brought to him; and in that consideration he came the later to me: but he bad me look for it, for that I should not look in vain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for pacifying the Kings anger against you,</hi> beleeve me, you need not much trouble your self. There is nothing in <hi>Him,</hi> which needs pacifying: there are ways wherby you may more and more gain <hi>him,</hi> and make <hi>him</hi> yours: and it would be worth your labour, if you do it. And do it you may, if you take that course, which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65108:13"/>
you cannot learn better of any man living, then of <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi> As for me, I gladly acknowledg that <hi>you</hi> are more moderate toward <hi>us,</hi> then most of your men common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are: and, the more you convers with <hi>Antiquity,</hi> will be daily more and more: nay, I add, and much more would be, if <hi>your Church</hi> would give you leave; and I would to <hi>God,</hi> it would. It should seem that <hi>shee</hi> hath transfer'd the faults of <hi>Persons</hi> upon <hi>Things</hi>; and, for some <hi>abuse,</hi> hath taken away the <hi>lawful use</hi>: a fault which you should by little and little unlearn <hi>Her.</hi> You, while you follow and sway with it, follow not the bent of your own mind and iudgment; for Iiudg of <hi>your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> by your <hi>pen</hi>; which was so well inclin'd toward <hi>us,</hi> that it had wrote (and, I think, not against your mind) that <hi>Our Order of Bishops was a thing received in the Church even from the time of the Apostles.</hi> And indeed your pen had wrote very right: Mary, you blotted out [<hi>of the Apostles</hi>] and, in leiu of it, put in [<hi>next to the Apostles.</hi>] But this, I beleeve, you did in favour of <hi>your Church.</hi> And, indeed, that was very true, which you put in [<hi>next to the Apostles</hi>] but that not a whit less true, which you blotted out. For <hi>that Order</hi> was not only from the <hi>Age next to the Apostles,</hi> but even from <hi>the very Age of the Apostles</hi>; or els all <hi>Antiquity</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives us, and ther's not a <hi>Church-History</hi> left worth credit. That <hi>all Antiquity</hi> is for <hi>us,</hi> you your self deny not; and whether <hi>We</hi> must yeeld more to any <hi>present Church,</hi> then to <hi>all Antiquity,</hi> judg you. If I know you well, the more free and ingenuous I am in writing thus to you, you will love me the better: and so shall I you, if you deal as freely with me in it.</p>
               <p>Hear me then I pray. This is not enough for <hi>us,</hi> if a man do not reject <hi>Our Church Government,</hi> as a thing faulty or sinfull, for this is it <hi>We</hi> stand upon, that it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65108:14"/>
may be clear and confessed by all, that the <hi>Government of our Church</hi> is such, as cometh most neer to the <hi>form</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of the <hi>Antient Church,</hi> or (as you grant) <hi>that, next to the Apostles,</hi> or (as you had once wrote, and we contend for't) of <hi>the Apostolick Church.</hi> And, that you are of the same judgment with <hi>us,</hi> I doubt not. If then, by <hi>your Churches</hi> leave, you would once speak out, you should do <hi>us</hi> a curtesie; if you may not, no discurtesie, if for the future you would let <hi>Our</hi> affairs alone. For, that way you are in, it will scarce be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for you, both to <hi>please your own,</hi> and not to <hi>displease us.</hi> And yet, though <hi>Our Government</hi> be by <hi>Divine Right,</hi> it follows not, either that there is <hi>no salvation,</hi> or that <hi>a Church cannot stand, without it.</hi> He must needs be <hi>stone-blind,</hi> that <hi>sees not Churches standing without it:</hi> He must needs be <hi>made of iron,</hi> and <hi>hard hearted,</hi> that <hi>denys them salvation.</hi> We are not made of that metal, we are none of those Ironsides; We put a wide difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them. Somewhat may be wanting, that is of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right,</hi> (at least in the <hi>external Government</hi>) and yet <hi>Salvation</hi> may be had. So that you shall not need <hi>to damn them to the pit of Hell, or pronounce the sentence of condemnation upon your flock.</hi> This is not to <hi>damn</hi> any thing, to <hi>preferr</hi> a better thing before it: This is not to <hi>damn your Church,</hi> to <hi>recall it</hi> to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other form, that <hi>all Antiquity</hi> was better pleased with, i. e. to <hi>Our:</hi> but this, when <hi>God</hi> shall grant the opportunity, and your estate may bear it. If we do but agree upon <hi>this</hi> point, in all <hi>the rest</hi> we shall not fall out. But yet we wish not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, that is but pieced and patched up, but an intire, absolute agreement, without any piecing and patching: which, we doubt not but, <hi>you</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise wish with <hi>us.</hi>

            </head>
            <p>GReat Sir. I received your Letters, full both of choice stuff, and of the testimony of your good affection to me. For although you seem to be a little more moved then ordinary, yet that great sweetness, which you temper your reproofs with, puts me in hope that your goodwill is not lessned toward me, and that you will readily accept of this my satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. It is to my great profit and honor to be taught by you; nor am I so sensless as to contend with a man of so great learning and worth. Neither indeed did I write to that end, that you should write to me again: for it is abundantly sufficient for me, if you take my Letters in good part. Nor are my wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of any such value, that they should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get you any trouble, or take you off from
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65108:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
your more weighty affairs. If therfore any thing was written by me amiss, I am much indebted to that my error, which hath drawn from you so learned and accurate Letters, that no gold can value, and weigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them; which I shal keep by me, while I live, as a most pretious <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and threasure.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, because you seem to me not to have reached my meaning in some pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of my former Letters, you will pardon me, if I endeavour in these to explain my mind a little more fully.</p>
            <p>I said that the <hi>Names</hi> of <hi>Presbyter</hi> and <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> are taken in the <hi>New Testament</hi> for one and the same.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> the same.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>difference</hi> between <hi>Bishop</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> 
               <hi>Presbyter</hi> is but of <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> not of <hi>Divine Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These things you wish had not been said by me. And you bring many Arguments to the contrary, indeed, learnedly and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, but wherof a good part toucheth not me. Breifly of each.</p>
            <p>You deny not but the <hi>Names</hi> of <hi>Presbyter</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and <hi>Bishop</hi> are <hi>promiscuously</hi> taken in the <hi>New

Testament.</hi> But, you say, to what purpose this? Forsooth, you think that I tacitly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate therby, that the <hi>Things</hi> likewise are <hi>promiscuous.</hi> For no man, likely, carps at the <hi>Name</hi>; but he that is ill affected to the <hi>Thing.</hi> And you add, that the <hi>Fathers,</hi> in those very places, wherin they teach that the <hi>Names</hi> are taken in the same sense, do presently apply a remedy, and add, that this afterward was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, and that the <hi>Names,</hi> as well as the <hi>Offices,</hi> were and are <hi>distinct.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here it is easie for me to prove to you that I had no purpose to abuse the passivity of the <hi>Names,</hi> therby to confound the <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</hi> For there I presently apply the same remedy, which, you truly say, was applyed by the Fathers.

            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> I come to the Second part of your censure. I said that there is but <hi>One Order</hi> of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter.</hi> You contrary-wise are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Bishops</hi> is another and diverse from that of <hi>Presbyters</hi>: and to that purpose bring many testimonies from the <hi>Fathers</hi>; who speak of the <hi>Ordination</hi> of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>: neither do I oppose; for the <hi>Antient's</hi> speak so, indeed. And although the <hi>Roman Pontifical</hi> absteins from <hi>that word,</hi> yet the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Bishops</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> did use it. <hi>Leo.</hi> then in his 87. <hi>Epistle,</hi> which is to the <hi>Bishops</hi> of the Province of <hi>Vienna,</hi> commandeth, I that a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,</hi> who is not rightly <hi>ordained,</hi> he displa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and, in the same <hi>Epistle,</hi> he often useth the same word. Now between an <hi>Order</hi> and a <hi>Degree</hi> you make this difference; that a <hi>Degree</hi> denotes only a <hi>Superiority</hi>; but an <hi>Order</hi> is a <hi>power</hi> to a <hi>special Act:</hi> That ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every <hi>Order</hi> is a <hi>Degree</hi>; but not every <hi>Degree</hi> an <hi>Order.</hi> Very well. For though many do not observe this difference of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65108:17"/>
words, yet it is best to use proper terms; that things which differ in <hi>substance,</hi> be distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in <hi>names,</hi> too. But these do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice me at all. For you should have consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with your self, whom I have to deal with. I dispute against the <hi>Pontificians,</hi> who make <hi>Seven Orders; Door keepers, Readers, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orcists, Acolyths, Subdeacons, Deacons, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>: but the <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>character</hi> of <hi>Bishops</hi> they will by no means have to be diverse from that of <hi>Presbyters.</hi> Could I, disputing with <hi>them,</hi> use other words, then such as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by them? Could I deal with <hi>them</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Bishops,</hi> which <hi>they</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg not? Should I have inveigh'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>them</hi> for not making the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> distinct from that of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> when <hi>our own Churches</hi> make it not? He that should do this, should not so much contest with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as with <hi>our own.</hi> Then to what purpose is it to insist so much upon the <hi>distinction</hi> of <hi>Words</hi>? since every <hi>Order</hi> is, by <hi>S. Paul,</hi> call'd a <hi>Degree.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.13.</note> Nor can a <hi>Bishop</hi> be depriv'd of his <hi>Orders,</hi> but he must be <hi>degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> and fall from his <hi>Degree.</hi> I pray, weigh my words well:<note place="margin">

               <hi>Every Bishop is a Presbyter, and a Priest of the Body of Christ; and of these
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65108:18"/>
the Church of Rome makes but one Order.</hi> It plainly appears that I do not in these words affirm, what ought to <hi>be beleeved,</hi> but what is the <hi>sense</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But heer somewhat falls in, which may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a doubt. It is confess'd by all, that every <hi>Bishop</hi> is a <hi>Presbyter</hi>: but a <hi>Presbyter</hi> is not a <hi>Deacon.</hi> Hence it comes to pass, that there is another manner of difference betwixt a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> and a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> then betwixt a <hi>Presbyter</hi> and a <hi>Deacon.</hi> Since therfore a <hi>Presbyter</hi> differs in <hi>Order</hi> from a <hi>Deacon,</hi> it seems to follow that a <hi>Bishop</hi> differs not in <hi>Order</hi> from a <hi>Presbyter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is it without some doubt, that you say, that <hi>Order</hi> is a <hi>power</hi> to a <hi>special Act.</hi> For a <hi>power</hi> to a <hi>special Act</hi> is given to many without <hi>Order</hi>; as to them who are <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily</hi> delegated to the performance of some <hi>special actions.</hi> Then you deny that <hi>Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> are another <hi>Order</hi> from <hi>Bishops</hi>: And yet an <hi>Archbishop</hi> hath a <hi>power</hi> to some <hi>special a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>; as namely, to call a <hi>Synod,</hi> and to do other offices, which are not lawfull for <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>; and which are not permitted to <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops</hi> themselves under the <hi>Papacy,</hi> but when <hi>they</hi> have received the <hi>Archiopiscopal
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65108:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Pall</hi> from <hi>the Pope.</hi> You, out of your great wisdom, will consider, whether it be appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent by these, that the <hi>power</hi> to a <hi>special A<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ction</hi> may be conferr'd, even by a <hi>Degree,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>Diversity</hi> of <hi>Order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Third point is still behind: to wit,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> that I said, that <hi>Episcopacy</hi> is by the most <hi>Antient Ecclesiastical,</hi> but yet not by <hi>Divine Right. You</hi> on the other side resolve and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein that it is by <hi>Divine Right</hi>: and to that purpose produce many examples of <hi>Bishops,</hi> S. <hi>Mark; Timothy; Titus; Clemens; Polycarp</hi>; S. <hi>Iames, Bishop</hi> of <hi>Hierusalem</hi>; all who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Episcopacy</hi> from the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles themselves.</hi> And you quote a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Fathers,</hi> who affirm as much. (Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly all, and according to the truth of the <hi>Primitive Historys.</hi>) But what then? Why, say you, if <hi>Bishops</hi> were constituted by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> plain it is that the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> is by <hi>Apostolical,</hi> and so consequently by <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right.</hi> This indeed is to make your self master of the whole strength of the cause. But that Axiom of yours [<hi>All things that are of Apostolical Right are likewise of Divine</hi>] seemes to me (by your good leave) to be liable to some exceptions. Many things were
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65108:19"/>
ordered about <hi>Ecclesiastical Policy,</hi> which even the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> acknowledgeth not to be of <hi>Divine Right,</hi> by not observing the same. S. <hi>Paul</hi> in 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> v. would have Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conesses appointed in the Church: But this fashion was long ago out of date. The same S. <hi>Paul</hi> 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> XIV. would that, at the same Hour, in the same Assembly, Three or Four should prophecy, i. e. as S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands it, <hi>Interpret the Word of God</hi>; and that the others should judg of what was spoken: which custome is long since ceased. The <hi>Apostles</hi> command, touching absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from things strangled and blood, was for many Ages observed by the <hi>Antient Church:</hi> witness the <hi>Apologetie</hi> of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> chap. IX. the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Gangra, Canon,</hi> II. and the <hi>Trullan, Canon</hi> LXVII. and there is frequent mention of the same point in the <hi>Councils</hi> of <hi>Worms</hi> and <hi>Orleance.</hi> yet S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> in his XXXII. Book against <hi>Faustus,</hi> chap. XIII. saith that <hi>Observing hereof was generally neglected by the Christians</hi>; and that they who were posses'd with that scruple were laugh'd at by others. You have, not the <hi>Apostles</hi> alone, but even, that precept of <hi>Christ</hi> himself, <hi>Touching shaking off the dust of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65108:19"/>
the feet, against the refusers of the Gospel.</hi> If any should now go about to lay the foundation of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> among the <hi>Tartars</hi> or <hi>Sinenses,</hi> were he bound to observe that Rite against the refractory? Such things as apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to <hi>Salvation</hi> and to <hi>Faith</hi> were ordered by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> by a <hi>Divine Inspiration</hi>; but in the <hi>rest</hi> they did often use <hi>their own pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>; as S. <hi>Paul</hi> intimates, 1. Corinth. 7.25.</p>
            <p>Nor are you ignorant, so oft as examples are brought of <hi>Bishops</hi> placed by the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> in a <hi>higher degree</hi> above <hi>Presbyters,</hi> what is commonly answered: <hi>viz.</hi> that they had not that preeminence, as <hi>Bishops,</hi> but as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists</hi>: of whose superiority above <hi>Pastors</hi> somewhat you may have in S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> on the IV. to the <hi>Ephesians.</hi> Which reply of what strength it is, I had rather stand to your iudgment, then any mans. Indeed S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> on that same place, makes <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists</hi> inferior to <hi>Bishops,</hi> and without <hi>Seas.</hi> Yet, however you shall call <hi>Titus, Timothy,</hi> and S. <hi>Mark,</hi> whether <hi>Bishops</hi> or <hi>Evangelists,</hi> it is clear <hi>they</hi> had <hi>Bishops</hi> their successors and <hi>heirs</hi> of their <hi>preeminence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You determine therfore that <hi>our Churches</hi> do offend against the <hi>Divine Right</hi>; yet so,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65108:20"/>
as you exclude them not from hope of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: but do think, that, in <hi>our Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> men may attain to Salvation: for this you brought in, in your Second Letter, that you might deal the kindlier with us. But in your larger, you liken us, in this point, to <hi>Aerius</hi>; who, you say, was deservedly, upon this ground, by the <hi>Antients</hi> put in the <hi>black Book</hi> of <hi>Hereticks.</hi> Herein, Great Sir, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to your equity. Think with your self, what streits you drive me to. For, if I should have spoke, as you conceive it, I could not but necessarily accuse <hi>our Church</hi> of <hi>Heresie</hi>; and so doing, be forced <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to be pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to leave my station here, and to provide for my self as I could. Nor could I say that the <hi>Primacy</hi> of <hi>Bishops</hi> is by <hi>Divine Right</hi> but I should brand <hi>our Churches,</hi> (which have spilt so much blood for Christ) with Heresie. For, questionless, to be obstinately set against such things, as are of <hi>Divine Right,</hi> and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily to gainsay what <hi>God</hi> commands, is <hi>downright Heresie,</hi> whether it concern <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Discipline.</hi> Besides that I should have overthrown <hi>that Principle,</hi> wherwith cheifly <hi>our Religion</hi> defends her self against <hi>Popery, viz. That what things are by Divine Right are
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65108:20"/>
sufficiently and evidently contein'd in the Holy Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hear what you will reply. That it had been safer and better for me, to have been si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in these points, then itch to be writing so unseasonably. Because therby it comes to pass that I must necessarily <hi>offend our own Church, or your</hi>; nay, haply, both. And to tell you truth, I had rather have been silent: for very unwillingly I sett my mind to write; nor did I write, but upon command. <hi>Arnoldus</hi> the <hi>Iesuite,</hi> the <hi>Kings Confessor,</hi> publikely and in the pulpit, before <hi>His Majestie,</hi> inveigh'd against the Confession of <hi>our Church,</hi> and further in a pestilent book revil'd it, wherin he mightily insults over <hi>us,</hi> in this question, and odiously seeks to overthrow <hi>our Churches Government</hi>: This book coming to be sold all over <hi>France,</hi> through the high ways and streets, at the voice of a Cryer, did greatly scandalize many. Nay, before this, the Pulpits, the Markets, the Court, the Streets, and the very Barbers shops, rang with this question. This is the field wherin wanton witts sport themselves daily. How earnestly my Book was look'd for, which should stop that insolency, it doth thence
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65108:21"/>
appear, that, in Four months space, it was nine times printed. I could not therfore shun this task. Nor was it possible to write exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of that Argument, but I must begin with the signification of the words, <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi>; and treat of the <hi>Original</hi> of the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi> But here I took occasion to speak ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norably of the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
               <note place="margin">* * *</note> I deriv'd the dignity of <hi>Bishops,</hi> from the very <hi>infancy</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> I condemn'd <hi>Aerius.</hi> I said that S. <hi>Iames</hi> himself was <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:</hi> from whom in a long course, the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of <hi>Bishops</hi> of that City is deduced. Only this one thing was wanting, <hi>viz.</hi> that I did not say that <hi>our Church</hi> was heretical, and did trample the <hi>Divine Right</hi> under her feet; which, indeed, I neither could nor ought to do; yea, had I done it, you your self would have noted that want of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in me.</p>
            <p>This may serve for the Three chief points: To which you further add this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary; namely, your iudgment touching the <hi>Title</hi> of my book, [which I wrote for <hi>France,</hi>] Of the <hi>Calling</hi> of <hi>Pastors.</hi> These words, you say, are <hi>novell,</hi> and never used by any of the <hi>Antients</hi> in this sense. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65108:21"/>
indeed, that the word <hi>Calling</hi> is unusual among the <hi>Antients,</hi> nor taken in that sense. But we <hi>Frenchmen</hi> speak otherwise: for as many as have wrote of that Argument, either <hi>Our,</hi> or <hi>Papists</hi> use this word: which, with us, signifies somewhat more then <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>; for it is taken for the <hi>Office</hi> it self. If I had wrote in <hi>Latin,</hi> I should have given this <hi>Title,</hi> of the <hi>Office</hi> and <hi>Ordination</hi> of <hi>Pastors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither would you have all <hi>Presbyters and Ministers of the Word of God, to be called by the name of Pastors.</hi> For this word, you say, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs only to <hi>Bishops,</hi> (and that the <hi>Antients</hi> spake so.) If this be true, Worthy Sir, the <hi>Churches</hi> in <hi>France, Germany, Lowcountrys</hi> and <hi>Helvetia,</hi> are flocks without a <hi>Pastor.</hi> But S. <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> the xx commandeth the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of <hi>Ephesus, pascere,</hi> i. e. to be <hi>Pastors</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> v. 17. &amp; 28. And S. <hi>Peter, in his</hi> 1. <hi>Epist.</hi> 5. ch. 1. 2. v. <hi>The Presbyters, who are among you, I exhort,</hi> — Pascite, <hi>feed the flock of God, which is among you, taking the over-sight therof, not by constraint but willingly; not for filthy lucre:</hi> which exhortation to diligence, and shunning filthy lucre, no doubt, belongs also to the <hi>inferior Presbyters.</hi> Now to think that they ought not be called <hi>Pastors,</hi> whom
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65108:22"/>
God commands <hi>Pascere,</hi> to feed the flock, I cannot persuade my self. But, if the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God</hi> be <hi>Pabulum,</hi> the food of Souls, I see not why he should not be call'd a <hi>Pastor,</hi> who doth administer <hi>this</hi> food. S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the fourth to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> verse, 11. makes an enumeration of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Offices: God gave some Apostles, some Prophets, some Evangelists, some Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and Teachers.</hi> If <hi>Presbyters</hi> who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the <hi>Word,</hi> whom we <hi>Frenchmen</hi> call <hi>Ministers,</hi> be not understood under the name of <hi>Pastors,</hi> I see not what place they can have in this enumeration of the <hi>Apostle.</hi> S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> in his 59. <hi>Epistle,</hi> saith, that <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Doctors,</hi> here, are the same. The same thinketh S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> upon this place of S. <hi>Paul. Vincentius Lirinensis,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding this place, maketh no mention of <hi>Pastors,</hi> but comprehends them vnder <hi>Doctors,</hi> whom he calls <hi>Treatisers,</hi> who certainly were a different thing from <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</hi> But that <hi>Bishops</hi> only are <hi>Doctors,</hi> I never yet read any where. S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> is so far from thinking the name of <hi>Pastors</hi> to belong only to <hi>Bishops,</hi> that he even calls <hi>Readers, Pastors. Readers,</hi> saith he, <hi>are,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65108:22"/>
and may be Pastors, who fatten the souls of their Auditors with Reading.</hi> The term <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor</hi> is usual among the <hi>Prophets:</hi> Prophet <hi>Isaiah.</hi> 56. 11. Prophet <hi>Ieremiah.</hi> 10. 21. and 22. 22. and 23. 1. 2. Prophet <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel.</hi> 34. 2. and Prophet <hi>Zachariah.</hi> 10. 3. Which places whosoever shall weigh in the even ballance of judgment, he shall find, that under the name of <hi>Pastors</hi> were rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd not only the <hi>cheif Priests,</hi> or the <hi>heads of the Levites</hi> but <hi>all the Prophets</hi> and <hi>Levites,</hi> upon whom the <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>teaching</hi> lay.</p>
            <p>But the following matter, and my earnest desire to satisfie you, hath carried me beyond my bounds. I have too too much abus'd your leasure.

               <p>I Never could learn this trick of saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or (which is all one) of tossing replys. No, not, when my years were fitter for it. But now old age, which of it self is a diseas, and yet never cometh without diseases at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it, plucks me by the ear, and bids me get me out of this cockpit, and rank my self with them, whose whole business is <hi>Prayer.</hi> Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, because in this skirmishing, it hath happen'd to us both alike, <hi>viz,</hi> that we have not reach'd one anothers meaning, I shall, not unwillingly, more fully and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expound my mind to you, as you did your to me.</p>
               <p>That which I first meet withall is but a slight mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for I do not understand at all, how I was any whit more mov'd then ordinary. Neither do I remember ought of yours, that mov'd me more then ordinary; nay that mov'd me at all; but only that you said, that some passages of yours had griev'd the <hi>Kings</hi> soul. That word [greiv'd] greiv'd me somwhat, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, and mov'd me more then ordinary: Besides, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that I remember.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His Majestie</hi> had made <hi>three dashes</hi> upon your <hi>Book.</hi> Touching <hi>them</hi> you would know of me, what my mind was, what I thought. I answered, as was truth, where the <hi>King</hi> had made <hi>them, they</hi> ought to be made.</p>
               <p>The first place, noted by the King, was that, <hi>concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the passivity of the words,</hi> (as you speak.) I said it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:65108:24"/>
was justly noted. Here you did not reach my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for you take it for all one, as if I had said <hi>that you therby did tacitly insinuate,</hi> I know not what. But that came not into my thoughts. I did not say, what <hi>you did therby insinuate,</hi> but <hi>what others would snatch at from thence.</hi> For, questionless, <hi>snatch at</hi> they will, <hi>as if you did insinuate,</hi> though you did not, as men are, and stand affected. I, for my part, do not deny, that <hi>those words</hi> are taken for <hi>one and the same</hi>; and so far you are right. This I deny, that those things which are right may all of them, safely, by any man, at any time, be committed to writing. For you must consider, not so much what <hi>you</hi> might <hi>mean</hi> there, as what <hi>others</hi> would <hi>snatch</hi> from thence. Our writings must be regulated by that of the <hi>Apostle, Not what is lawfull, but what is expedient.</hi> See you, whether this controversie be seasonable at this time; and whether it were advisedly done by you; and whether it be not expedient, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to cut off occasions from them, who earnestly snatch at all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of setting novelties afoot. Perhaps, I fear what is safe enough, but I fear though, lest, an occasion being taken from hence, those stirrs unhappily break out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, which seemed wholy to be made up among us.</p>
               <p>Nor was I ever of that opinion, I never wrote it, <hi>that afterward it was otherwise done.</hi> That was not done o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise <hi>afterward,</hi> which was done by the <hi>Apostles themselves.</hi> It is S. <hi>Chrysostoms: were there many Bishops in one City? by no means.</hi> It is S. <hi>Hieroms: For in one City there could not be many Bishops.</hi> It is <hi>Theodorets: It could not be, that there should be many Pastors in one City.</hi> Of what time are these to be understood? When were there not? When could there not be those <hi>many Pastors</hi> in <hi>one City</hi>? What, when S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> S. <hi>Hierom Theodoret</hi> lived? doubtless, when the <hi>Apostle</hi> wrote that to the <hi>Philippians.</hi> I could

               <p n="2">2.

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Then, no where do they say, that <hi>any constitution</hi> was made about it. Nor do I think you will ever read of any such [<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or] <hi>constitution,</hi> in any History. We read, indeed, in the <hi>Acts,</hi> that the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Deacons</hi> was <hi>constituted</hi> by <hi>them:</hi> of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> of <hi>Bishops,</hi> there was <hi>no constitution:</hi> for <hi>Bishops</hi> were formerly instituted by <hi>Christ</hi> in the <hi>Apostles</hi>; and <hi>Presbyters</hi> in the <hi>Seventy Two.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Nor only, that any was <hi>called Bishop,</hi> but that he <hi>was</hi> a <hi>Bishop.</hi> For there were no <hi>Titular Bishops</hi> then: they had their <hi>Name</hi> from their <hi>Office:</hi> they were <hi>called</hi> what they <hi>were</hi>; they <hi>were,</hi> what they were <hi>called.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Nor that should be only with <hi>preeminence,</hi> but that should be invested with <hi>power: power,</hi> I say, of <hi>Imposition of hands,</hi> of <hi>commanding,</hi> of <hi>receiving informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> of <hi>reproving.</hi>

other ends,</hi> for which, we said, that <hi>power</hi> was given.</p>
               <p>You see that the <hi>Fathers</hi> had <hi>another gates remedy</hi> for this disease: and that those speeches of yours, <hi>It was constituted; That should be called; should have the preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi>; are too narrow; and I add, by your leave, too weak and dilute; nor the same with those, which are the ingredients of that medicine, which the <hi>Fathers</hi> made.</p>
               <p>But yet I have a mind here to put the question; <hi>If Confusion commonly growes from Equality,</hi> how comes it to pass, that there is no need of this remedy among you?</p>
               <p>Again; if it be true, <hi>that this Form of Government was received every where by all Churches</hi>; that, which was <hi>every where</hi> receiv'd by <hi>all,</hi> why doth not <hi>your Ghurch</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive? why doth <hi>She</hi> only run counter to <hi>all the Churches,</hi> which then were <hi>every where</hi>? For that is a most true word, you said, and deserv'd an asterisk of commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>That all Churches everywhere receiv'd this Form of Government.</hi> Nor were there ever, before <hi>this Age, any Churches,</hi> which were governed by any <hi>other,</hi> then by <hi>Bishops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherfore there was no cause at all, <hi>that you should go about to wipe off that suspition,</hi> (for I had none of you,) <hi>that you were not well affected to our Order.</hi> I shall never be induced to beleeve it; for I cannot but give credit to you, affirming it in your Letters, that <hi>your Countrymen complain of you,</hi> for favoring and wishing so well vnto it. Indeed, that you wish well, I doubt not at all; but ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I am more perswaded by your <hi>word,</hi> then by your <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For here you slip from the <hi>Order</hi> to the <hi>Persons</hi> of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>: of whose <hi>Learning, Industrie, Martyrdom,</hi> you speak much and excellently. But there were, as you

For the <hi>Order</hi> it self, if it be such as you would have it seem, the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>England</hi> cannot make <hi>it better,</hi> nor of <hi>Spain worse.</hi> I advis'd you not to transferr the faults of <hi>Persons</hi> upon <hi>Things</hi>; and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learn <hi>your Church</hi> that custom.</p>
               <p>As for those <hi>Antients,</hi> whom you worthily call the <hi>Light of the Church,</hi> and who themselves were <hi>Bishops,</hi> though you say much, yet you say not enough. For this is not enough, <hi>That you would not give sentence against them; That they were not wrongfully made; That they did not usurp an unlawfull Office</hi>: These are but terms of <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution, Not give sentence against; Not wrongfully made; not usurpers of an unlawfull Office</hi>; speak out, speak as the truth is, <hi>That they were lawfully made</hi>; (lawfully, if ever any) and did <hi>exercise a most lawfull Office:</hi> That <hi>our,</hi> at this day, are to be made after <hi>their</hi> example: That the <hi>same Office</hi> is to be exercised by all <hi>Ours</hi>: These speak home to the <hi>Order,</hi> are nothing to the <hi>Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, whatever become of those passages, I cannot but commend your conclusion there; nor shall I stick to set an asterisk of approbation upon it: I would to <hi>God</hi> that might put an end to the whole controversie betwixt us. It is this: <hi>The venerable Antiquity of those first Ages shall be ever in greater esteem with me then the new upstart device of any whosoever.</hi> O would to <hi>God,</hi> that <hi>Antiquity</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:65108:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
might be more and more in esteem with <hi>you</hi> with <hi>all</hi>: for if Antiquity might prevail, if these <hi>new upstart devices</hi> were discarded, then, sure, the <hi>Cause</hi> of <hi>this Order</hi> could not be in danger.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> The Second dash of dislike set by <hi>His Majestie,</hi> and very justly, was at that place, where you contend that the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter is one and the same.</hi> I have shew'd that it is <hi>not the same.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Both, 1. Because the <hi>Offices</hi> are <hi>not the same.</hi> For a <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter</hi> doth <hi>not Ordain</hi>; no, not in <hi>S. Hieroms</hi> iudgment.</p>
               <p>As also, 2. Because there is <hi>not the same Imposition of hands,</hi> but a <hi>new one</hi> in a <hi>Bishop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, 3. Because, among the <hi>Fathers, Isidore</hi> clearly calls it the <hi>Order of Bishops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And lastly, 4. Because those <hi>Two Orders</hi> were distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished by <hi>Christ</hi> in the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and the <hi>Seventy Two.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here you produce to us the Title of the <hi>Pontifical</hi>; which is concerning <hi>Consecration,</hi> not <hi>Ordination.</hi> I shew'd that the <hi>Antient Bishops,</hi> even of <hi>Rome</hi> it self, spake o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise; otherwise the <hi>later Popes.</hi> Among the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi> that the word <hi>Ordination</hi> was most usual, and most approved.</p>
               <p>You appeal to the Schole. I acquainted you, in what sense the Schole calls <hi>them</hi> the <hi>same,</hi> or <hi>not the same.</hi> The <hi>same</hi> in reference to the <hi>Body of Christ</hi>; upon which they terminat <hi>their Seven Orders</hi>: About the <hi>Body of Christ</hi> a <hi>Presbyter</hi> doth as much as <hi>a Bishop.</hi> You your self say as much: <hi>Of these in respect of the Body of Christ, the Church of Rome makes but one Order. Not the same</hi>; if you respect the <hi>power</hi> to a <hi>special Act, viz.</hi> of <hi>Ordination,</hi> which is <hi>peculiar</hi> to a <hi>Bishop.</hi> This is <hi>not mine,</hi> as you imagin'd, but the definition of <hi>Orders,</hi> all the <hi>Schole</hi> over. Nor yet <hi>that difference,</hi> which afterward you put upon <hi>me: both</hi> of them are from the <hi>Schole</hi>; both <hi>definition and differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:65108:26"/>
These things, if you would speak <hi>Scholastically,</hi> were not to be deny'd by you, who appeal'd to the <hi>Schole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to what purpose do you say, <hi>that you deal with or, that you dispute against the Pontificians, who will not have the Order of Bishops distinct from that of Presbyters</hi>? And yet presently you subjoin: <hi>Ought I to inveigh against them,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the Pontificians) <hi>because they do not make the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Bishops distinct from that of Presbyters, when Our Churches do not make it neither? He that should do this, should not so much contest with the Church of Rome, as with our own.</hi> You <hi>dispute</hi> therfore against them, but yet you will not <hi>inveigh</hi> against them: you <hi>dispute</hi> against the <hi>Pontificians,</hi> and yet you <hi>allege</hi> their <hi>Pontifical.</hi> You di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute against <hi>them,</hi> yet <hi>your own Churches</hi> do the self same thing. Nor yet will you affirm, <hi>what ought to be beleev'd, but what the Church of Rome thinketh: which</hi> thinketh the very same that <hi>your Church</hi> doth; and <hi>your Church,</hi> I beleeve, you would have to be beleev'd. You do not therfore contest with the <hi>Pontificians; for,</hi> I trow you have no mind to contest with <hi>your own.</hi> 'Twere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst your Religion so to do. Nevertheless <hi>your Church,</hi> as you confess, doth the same thing in this point that the <hi>Roman</hi> doth.</p>
               <p>You say it is <hi>best to use proper terms, that the things which differ in</hi> substance <hi>be distinguished in</hi> Name: and yet in the same page, afterward, as if you were som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what angry, you ask, <hi>To what end is it, to stick so much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the distinction of Words</hi>? To what end then is it, to make <hi>proper words,</hi> which are made <hi>proper</hi> for no other end, but for <hi>distinction</hi>? If this be to no end, it is better, trust me, neither to <hi>use proper words,</hi> nor to <hi>make</hi> any <hi>words</hi> at all <hi>proper</hi>; for we must use the <hi>better,</hi> both <hi>you,</hi> and <hi>we.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:65108:27"/>Notwithstanding this, why do you reject the <hi>distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of words,</hi> here? Because, <hi>every Order</hi> (you say) is <hi>a Degree.</hi> What then? Since <hi>every Degree</hi> is not an <hi>Order,</hi> if we will use <hi>proper words. Deaconry,</hi> in S. <hi>Paul,</hi> is a <hi>Degree</hi>; and the <hi>same</hi> is an <hi>Order</hi> with all men. But <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaconship</hi> is a new <hi>Degree,</hi> and yet no <hi>Order. Nor can a Bishop be outed of his Order, but he must be degraded</hi> (say you) <hi>or fall from his Order.</hi> Yea, but he may be <hi>degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> though he be <hi>not outed of his Order</hi>; for of his <hi>Order</hi> he can <hi>no way be outed.</hi> For after (that, which they call) <hi>Degradation,</hi> there remaineth a <hi>power</hi> to the <hi>Acts</hi> of his <hi>Order</hi>: the <hi>use</hi> of which <hi>power</hi> may be <hi>inhibited</hi>; the <hi>power</hi> it self <hi>cannot</hi> be <hi>taken away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here some scruples arise in your mind. The First is: <hi>that every Bishop</hi> is a <hi>Presbyter:</hi> very true that, and confest by all. But a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> you say, is not a <hi>Deacon.</hi> Among you, haply, he is not, according to your novell device: But with that <hi>Reverend Antiquity</hi> (which you speak of) he is: Nay, then, a <hi>Bishop</hi> himself is a <hi>Deacon:</hi> Read S. <hi>Chrysostom, Even a Bishop was call'd a Deacon; wherupon</hi> S. Paul, writing to <hi>Timothy, said, Fulfill thy Deaconry; to him, being a Bishop. Whence also it is, that many Bishops now adays write, to my Fellow-Presbyter, to my Fellow-Deacon.</hi> Read S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> on the 4. to the <hi>Ephesians. For all Orders are in a Bishop; because he is the first Priest,</hi> i. e. <hi>the Prince of Priests.</hi> And, on the 1. to the <hi>Corinth</hi>: 12. <hi>Though Apostles be Prophets too; for the first Degree hath all other vnder it.</hi> I may truly therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr the contrary; <hi>Seing a Bishop differs not from a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, by any other way of difference, then a Presbyter doth from a Deacon; But a Presbyter differs from a Deacon in his Order; therfore it is agreable, that a Bishop differ from a Presbyter in his Order.</hi> This ever seem'd agreable to the consent of <hi>Antiquity.</hi> I wonder that these things scap'd
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65108:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you; for I dare not suspect, that what are so obvious to <hi>all</hi> are unknown to <hi>you.</hi> But the <hi>Deaconry,</hi> in use a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>you,</hi> deceived you; a meer stranger <hi>it,</hi> I speak it boldly, to all <hi>Antiquity</hi> (with whom <hi>Deacons</hi> were ever one part of the Clergy.)</p>
               <p>The Second scruple. That <hi>Order</hi> is a <hi>power</hi> to a <hi>special Act,</hi> I say not of myself; the whole <hi>Schole</hi> saith so; it is the <hi>definition</hi> of <hi>Order</hi> received in the <hi>Scholes</hi>: speak you, if you have another; for I remember not that I have any where read of any other. Your scruple here ariseth from them, who (say you) are <hi>extraordinarily delegated to the performance of certain Acts.</hi> I rejoin: What have they who are delegated <hi>without Order,</hi> to do <hi>with Order</hi>? The very word <hi>Order</hi> requireth that this be understood of <hi>ordinary power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Third Scruple. An <hi>Archbishop hath a power to a special Act.</hi> What Act? To call a Synod. I eas you of this scruple also. <hi>This Act</hi> is <hi>not special</hi> to an <hi>Archbishop</hi>: for a <hi>Bishop</hi> exerciseth the <hi>same Act: He</hi> doth as much call a <hi>Synod in his Diocess,</hi> as <hi>the other</hi> doth <hi>in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</hi> Though, if we will speak truly, <hi>the calling of Synods is a special Act to neither of them, but is by Delegation from the Prince</hi>; by whose Laws there is special provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion against unlawful Assemblys. You, in your wisdom, see, that nothing appears here, why either by a <hi>Degree</hi> any <hi>Power</hi> may be conferd, or by an <hi>Order</hi> may not be conferd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Third dash of dislike</hi> was upon your <hi>denying Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> to be of Divine Right.</hi> you grant it to be of <hi>Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</hi> But <hi>that</hi> serves not you to make it be <hi>of Divine Right. No, not among us, who do not observe certain things which were appointed by the Apostles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, 1. <hi>not Widows.</hi> I read of no command there for the appointing of <hi>Widows</hi>: but for <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and those
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65108:28"/>
                  <hi>Churches,</hi> which had <hi>Widows,</hi> there is a command touching <hi>their Age.</hi> The institution of <hi>Widows,</hi> was left free to <hi>every Church.</hi> For none were to mantein Widows, unless they would; and, indeed, they could not be manteined among the poorer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Not,</hi> 2. <hi>that Custom for three or four to prophecy at one hour.</hi> But that Custom was, cleerly, <hi>extraordinary</hi>; and the extraordinary gifts ceasing, that ceased too.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Not,</hi> 3. <hi>to abstein from things strangled, &amp; blood.</hi> Yea, but that was <hi>temporary,</hi> not appointed by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> with any other intention, then, to be in force, during the <hi>non-burial</hi> of the <hi>Synagoge</hi>; the <hi>Synagoge once bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,</hi> to be free, to observe or not.</p>
               <p>So your first instance was, <hi>not necessary</hi>; your second, not <hi>ordinary</hi>; your third, <hi>temporary, not perpetual.</hi> These do not make a <hi>Divine Right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, that the <hi>Precepts</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> may not be of <hi>Divine Right,</hi> you will not have <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> touching <hi>shaking off the dust of their feet, to be so,</hi> neither. But, in truth, <hi>this</hi> is no <hi>Precept</hi>; but, if a <hi>Precept,</hi> of <hi>Divine Right.</hi> For, I hope, you will not say that <hi>Christ</hi> commanded <hi>this, using his Prudence, without Divine inspiration.</hi> No man ever understood that, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, according to the <hi>Letter</hi>; and that upon this ground; because it was <hi>sometime observed, sometime altered, sometime quite omitted:</hi> not according to the <hi>Letter,</hi> I say, but, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, according to the <hi>mind</hi> of the speaker. Whose mind was, that such were to be given for desperate, whether <hi>with</hi> or <hi>without</hi> using the <hi>Ceremony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, be more sparing, I pray, of that point, <hi>of the Apostles oftimes using their prudence.</hi> For it cannot be said or writ without great danger, <hi>that the Apostles in some things had Divine Inspiration, in the rest did often use their own prudence</hi>; and that in their writings which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65108:28"/>
For even that very place, where <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my judgment,</hi> you know, is concluded with [<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>] <hi>But I think also that I have the Spirit of God.</hi> so that his very <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, his judgment had the dictate <hi>therof,</hi> from the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> As for that place, which you quote, if it were not written by <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inspiration,</hi> but by <hi>humane prudence,</hi> we are to score it for <hi>Apocryphal.</hi> How then? are we for making an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex,</hi> and for <hi>Expurging the New Testament</hi>? For sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate we must the <hi>pretious</hi> from the <hi>vile.</hi> What were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctated by <hi>humane prudence</hi> will never stand in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with those which were by <hi>Divine inspiration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, although there be weight enough to confirm this cause, from the <hi>Right</hi> and maner of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> yet, you may remember, that I deriv'd this distinction of <hi>Orders</hi> higher, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>Christ</hi> our Saviour in the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> and <hi>Seventy-Two Disciples.</hi> That it is every where among the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and clearly confessed by <hi>them,</hi> that <hi>Bishops</hi> succeeded the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> the <hi>seventy Two.</hi> I cited <hi>Cyprian; But Deacons must remember, how our</hi> Lord <hi>chose</hi> Apostles, <hi>i. e.</hi> Bishops <hi>and</hi> Prelates; <hi>but the</hi> Apostles, <hi>after the</hi> Ascension <hi>of our</hi> Lord, <hi>appointed to themselves</hi> Deacons, <hi>as ministers of their</hi> Episcopacy, <hi>and of the</hi> Church. That those <hi>Seven</hi> were instituted, <hi>Acts</hi> VI. by the <hi>Apostles</hi>; but no <hi>Presbyters,</hi> but after the example of the <hi>Seventy Two</hi>; nor <hi>Bishops,</hi> but after <hi>their own</hi> pattern. <hi>This Order</hi> therfore hath the strength and sinews therof, not only from the <hi>Apostles,</hi> but even from our <hi>Saviour</hi> himself.</p>
               <p>Would you have me fetch it yet higher? even out of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> and there from the <hi>Divine Law</hi> it self? S. <hi>Hierom</hi> doth: <hi>And that we may know that the Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal traditions were taken out of the</hi> Old Testament; <hi>what</hi> Aaron, <hi>and his</hi> Sons, <hi>and the</hi> Levites <hi>were in the</hi> Temple,

               <p>But far be it from me that I should drive you to <hi>any streits.</hi> For neither would I have you hold your peace, being so <hi>provoked by the Iesuit.</hi> Nay, but write, by al means write: but yet, when you write, so mantein your own, that you pinch not upon, I say not, other mens matters which belong not to you; yes, which somewhat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern you: (for our affairs are not meer strangers to you.) And, see, heer's a larg field for you, wherin you may shew the sharpness of your, wit, (which indeed is excellent.) But do not, do not hope that you can <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, play on both sides. <hi>Your own will complain of you</hi>; Ours need no such defence; So you will loose the thanks of either side.</p>
               <p>But, although <hi>these things be evidently enough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in Holy Scriptures,</hi> to any whose eye is single, yet is not that Principle so, as you have laid it. For, not what belong to <hi>Divine Right,</hi> but what belong to <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Good manners</hi> [are evidently enough conteined.] But these are not adaequate to <hi>Divine Right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Howbeit, you might well, you might have wrote (as you speak) exactly, had you begun, not where the <hi>words</hi> were <hi>promiscuous,</hi> but, where the <hi>Things</hi> being

always <hi>distinct,</hi> the <hi>signification of the words</hi> began like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to be <hi>distinct.</hi> It was possible for you to have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steined from words <hi>aequivocal, confused,</hi> and <hi>promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously taken</hi>; nor did any necessity enforce you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin there.</p>
               <p>You might also have balk'd all occasion of diverting to us. <hi>Your design was touching Bishops:</hi> you were to treat of <hi>them,</hi> and of the <hi>Office it self.</hi> Of the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to what purpose? Doth <hi>England</hi> make that lawfull, which out of <hi>England</hi> is unlawfull? The <hi>abuses</hi> of men, wherever they are, must be taxed: the <hi>office</hi> it self, in what country soever, is the same; of it self, in it self, by it self lawfull: Nor, if the <hi>Bishops</hi> be not good, is the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> of <hi>Bishops</hi> not good: Yea but let the <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> be, let <hi>Them</hi> be no <hi>Bishops,</hi> unless they make good their Name.</p>
               <p>But here, I know, the King would set an asterisk of approbation. <hi>When you derive Episcopacy from the very infancy of the Church. When you acknowledg S.

                  <note place="margin">* * *</note> See, you have Three <hi>asterisks</hi> for the Three <hi>dashes.</hi> For these things are most true; and according to the judgment of the <hi>Antients,</hi> even of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who leads the train of the <hi>Antients. The true profession is the doctrine of the Apostles; and the antient state of the Church, through the while world, is according to the succession of Bishops, to whom</hi> They <hi>deliver'd that Church, which is in every place; which hath reached even unto us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Somwhat I added, afterward, concerning the novel, upstart name of <hi>Calling</hi>: and so of <hi>Pastors</hi>; (as they are now in use with you.) Touching that of <hi>Calling,</hi> you do not deny but that it is vnusual: you used, I suppose a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the figure of extenution; for it is so unusual, that it
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65108:31"/>
is not at all. <hi>Calling,</hi> indeed, is sometime used for the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi>; for <hi>Ordination,</hi> never. But neither do you deny what I observed touching that word, <hi>Pastors.</hi> Nor do you produce any, either among those <hi>Antients,</hi> or the <hi>later Writers,</hi> before our Age, that was so call'd, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Pastor,</hi> who was not, indeed, a <hi>Bishop.</hi> Only, I know not how, you heap up many things together, but all beside the matter: that you seem not in them neither to have reach'd my meaning. For, what if I grant all that you allege? <hi>That your flocks are not without a Pastor</hi>; (as it seemeth good to you to stile him:) That all you say out of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> S. <hi>Peter,</hi> the <hi>Prophets</hi> is true: What are these to me? who only say that the <hi>Antients</hi> spake <hi>thus</hi>; that <hi>that other name</hi> is not from <hi>Antiquity.</hi> I recall you therfore to this; That, among the <hi>Antient Christians</hi> in former ages, you shew me out of their writings, where the word <hi>Pastor</hi> was ever used, and they spake not of the <hi>Bishop</hi>: or, that it was used (as with you it is) of a <hi>Parish Priest.</hi> Prevail thus far with your self, as to shew <hi>this</hi>; for, unless you do <hi>this,</hi> you do nothing to the purpose.</p>
               <p>But yet see, of what force those things are, that you brought there. For S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not say there, that <hi>Presbyters</hi> [did <hi>pas ere</hi>] were <hi>Pastors</hi>: this He saith, <hi>Wherein the Holy Ghost hath made you Bishops</hi> [<hi>pascere</hi>] to feed [to be <hi>Pastors over</hi>] <hi>the Church of God.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul's Pastor</hi> therfore is a <hi>Bishop.</hi> And, lest you should think that the name <hi>Bishop</hi> is to be taken, there, <hi>appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively</hi> (as if you would say, <hi>Such as haue the Cure of</hi>) not <hi>properly</hi>; behold, the <hi>Syriack</hi> Interpreter himself reteins the <hi>Greek</hi> word <note place="margin">

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65108:32"/>
For I wholy doubt, whether that place, of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> belong to <hi>inferior Presbyters.</hi> For He addeth there (as you know) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>] being <hi>Bishops,</hi> with [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] being <hi>Pastors.</hi> That word indeed I stand not upon. That which follows there [<hi>not Lording it over the Clergy</hi>] doth plainly evince, that they, to whom S. <hi>Peter</hi> wrote this, had <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>power and authority over the Clergy:</hi> otherwise, that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> that <hi>Domineering</hi> and <hi>Lording</hi> over them could not possibly be apply'd to them. Wherfor S. <hi>Peters Pastor</hi> must needs be a <hi>Bishop.</hi> And who indeed can doubt of this, seing the conjunction of <hi>those two</hi> words took the first rise from S. <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, wheras you inferr that the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is [<hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulum</hi>] food: that therfore they, who administer <hi>this</hi> food, do [<hi>pascere</hi>] feed: I shall easily grant you, that feed they do, that is, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, but not therefore <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>But what you bring from that place to the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesians,</hi> chap. 4. are either <hi>uncertain</hi>; For 1.

To S. <hi>Augustine, Pastor</hi> and <hi>Doctor</hi> are no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the same, then <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Degree</hi> were, to us, a little before. Every <hi>Order</hi> a <hi>Degree,</hi> but not every <hi>Degree</hi> an <hi>Order</hi>: so every <hi>Pastor</hi> is a Doctor, but not every <hi>Doctor</hi> a <hi>Pastor.</hi> Who saith this? Saint <hi>Hierom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:65108:32"/>2. Of him, who makes no mention, there, of <hi>Pastors,</hi> nor will I make mention. The <hi>Monks</hi> are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inclin'd, commonly, to <hi>Treatisers,</hi> then to <hi>Bishops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. For S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> who understood <hi>Bishops</hi> in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles; Presbyters</hi> in <hi>Prophets; Deacons</hi> in <hi>Evangelists</hi>; no wonder, if at last he fell upon <hi>Readers,</hi> when he had none beside them, to whom, after <hi>those Three,</hi> he might referr them.</p>
               <p>Thus, say I, either <hi>vncertain</hi> they are: or, when they are <hi>Certain</hi> they make against you. By name, S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi>; Who defineth <hi>Pastors</hi> to be <hi>they,</hi> to whom was committed (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) the generality of the people. Are your so? And he adds who were <hi>such,</hi> as <hi>Timothy,</hi> saith he, and <hi>Titus</hi>; who were both <hi>Bishops</hi> in S. <hi>Chrysostoms</hi> account: and, I beleeve, in your account, they were more then <hi>Presbyters,</hi> labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Word.</p>
               <p>Yet remains what you glanc'd at, out of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. Which places if any do accurately consider, he shall find, that not only the high Priests, but also the Prophets and Levites, upon whom the Office of teaching lay, were called by the name of Pastors.</hi> Doubtless, he shall. Add moreover; he shall find <hi>Princes</hi> in the State, and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates</hi> often, nay oftner, a great deal, to be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the name of <hi>Pastors,</hi> then all them put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>whom</hi> you set down. And yet we do not call <hi>Princes</hi> by the name of <hi>Pastors.</hi> Nor do I think that at <hi>Geneva</hi> he is call'd a <hi>Pastor</hi> who is the chief <hi>Magistrate.</hi> The <hi>Pastors</hi> therfore in the <hi>Prophets</hi> reach not home to this. Tell me, who of the <hi>Antients</hi> ever spake so; otherwise we are beside the cushion.</p>
               <p>Lastly, that seem'd to me a wondrous strange op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. <hi>Indeed it is not by the Antients; but we Frenchmen speak so.</hi> For, must the <hi>Antients</hi> speak as
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65108:33"/>
the <hi>French</hi>; or the <hi>French</hi> as the <hi>Antient Christians</hi>? And you run upon the same rock again, afterward. The <hi>Presbyters who labour in the Word, whom we French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men call Ministers.</hi> For it's strange, how it became lawfull for <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> to put upon a <hi>Presbyter</hi> that <hi>name, which</hi> never any among the <hi>Antients</hi> used, but for a <hi>Deacon.</hi> I speak not this otherwise, but that even among <hi>us</hi> too, that bad fashion is taken up, of calling <hi>them Ministers,</hi> and <hi>Pastors</hi> too. But <hi>these words were brought in by them,</hi> who best relish any upstart fashion; but against their mind who reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence <hi>Antiquity</hi>; and, as they may, disclaim these usages. For we suffer, as I said, many things, which we teach not; and bear with that which we cannot take away. But he, that but bears with a thing, loves it not, though he loves to bear with it.</p>
               <p>And now you have an Answer to your Letters, so far as my occasions give me leave. For I have not the happiness of much leasure. But although I read none of yours unwillingly, yet I read no passage more willingly, then that last, wherin you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, <hi>How desirous you are of peace, how glad you should be that all the</hi> Reformed Churches, <hi>who are united by</hi> one Faith, <hi>were united by</hi> one <hi>and the same bond of</hi> Ecclesiastical Government.

               </p>
