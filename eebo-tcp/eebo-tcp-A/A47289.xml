            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>CHRISTIANITY, A DOCTRINE OF THE CROSS: OR, Passive Obedience, UNDER ANY Pretended Invasion of LEGAL RIGHTS and LIBERTIES.</p>
            <p>LONDON: Printed for <hi>Jos. Hindmarsh,</hi> and <hi>Rob. Kettlewell,</hi> and are to be sold at the <hi>Golden Ball</hi> in <hi>Cornhill.</hi> 1691.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT is a sad Reflection to a true Christian Spirit, to see some of the noblest Virtues of our Holy Religion, and Points of Good Practice, not only neglected in the Lives, but endeavoured to be driven out of the Reverence and Esteem of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Among these, I think none of late have bore more of the rude Batteries of Noise and Violence, or fallen deeper under the Wanton Sport or Malicious Strokes of Profane Wits, than the Doctrine of <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I take it to be an unquestionable Gospel Truth, and Primitive Doctrine. And to carry in it the most lively exercise and expression, of the two grand Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Patience.</hi> It is <hi>Faith,</hi> that under persecuting or oppressive Governors, rather than save our selves by sinning against God or them, dare run Ventures, and trust or rely on him, either to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent those Persecutions and outward Losses, that are ready to meet us in this stedfastness to our Duty, or to support us under them, and abundantly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensate


<pb facs="tcp:61813:3"/>
and Reward us for them. And it is <hi>Patience,</hi> that bears all the pressing Conflicts without Fainting, till the Grace of God has brought us through them. And these two Virtues, raise us so much above our selves, and this World; or above Human Weaknesses, Affections, and Interests: that God has always dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, them with especial Marks, and Prerogatives of his Favor and Acceptance. And on the same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, good Men have ever held them, as the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Glory of the Saints, and what they were most ambitiously to aim at. As on the other Hand, for the same Reason, they have ever been the greatest Terror and Stumbling-Block, to Worldly and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Minds.</p>
            <p>My design in the ensuing Papers, is to do what seasonable Service I am able, to this great and noble instance, of Oppressed Truth and Righteousness. And because, after all that has been so often, and so well said of late upon this Subject by others, particularly in the Elaborate and much Celebrated Discourses, of <hi>Jovian,</hi> and <hi>the Case of Resistance of the Supreme Powers Stated,</hi> &amp;c. The Adversaries of this Truth still insist with great Confidence and Triumph, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Plea <hi>of Legal Rights for Authorizing Resistance</hi>; I have singled out this Plea, and Discuss'd it in the ensuing Treatise. My aim is, not so much to ingage in particular and personal Disputes, as to speak to the Argument; and to say so much, as among Minds willing to see it, may be sufficient to Prove and Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish


<pb facs="tcp:61813:3"/>
a Doctrine so necessary, as that whereof I write, and to obviate the most Colorable Pretences brought against it. <hi>Passive Obedience,</hi> is a great, and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Truth: and I seek herein, by setting it off with as much Strength and Clearness, and withal as brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as I can, to build up honestly disposed Readers in the Belief and Practice thereof, notwithstanding any things, which, either in pretended <hi>Favor to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> or on any fancied <hi>Autority from Civil Right,</hi> they shall find urged in opposition to it.</p>
            <p>I must advertise thee further, that this Treatise was sent away in Company of another, Intituled, <hi>Of Christian Prudence,</hi> &amp;c. And being both then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and designed for the Press, there is a Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to it in Page 160. of that Book. Which, not being observed by those, who had the care there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, (the Author himself being at a great distance from the Press,) that Book was Published first, and this was left to follow it. And now it is come abroad, I beseech Almighty God of his Infinite Mercy to vouchsafe it his Acceptance, and to accompany it with his Grace, that it may not fail to do an Holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion some Honor, a Noble, but decried and exploded Duty, some Credit, and thy Self and his Church some Service.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>PAssive Obedience</hi> to Sovereign Powers, <hi>is keeping under their Obedience, when we suffer wrongfully at their hands.</hi> If they command things against the Law of God, or of the Land, we ought not; or if against the inviolable Liberties, which Laws have secured against the Prerogative in their respective Kingdoms, we need not ordinarily be <hi>Active,</hi> in doing what we are bidden. In other things, a just and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Authority must have <hi>Active Obedience.</hi> But when they come to punish against Laws, or for such things as with a safe Conscience their Subjects could not act in; they are still to continue under their Obedience, and in a state of Subjection. And this is by <hi>being Passive,</hi> or not rising up to Resist, and Levy War against them. They may seek to guard off the unjust Suffering, by Petitioning, by claiming the help of Law from Courts of Justice, whilst there are any Provisions for help yet untryed therein, or by any other fitting ways consistent


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61813:6"/>
with Subjection. But not by running to Arms when all other ways fail, and by lifting Soldiers, (for no Man will stand in Arms by himself against him,) to defend their own Rights against their lawful Sovereign. Whilst a Prince is our lawful Sovereign, Obedience must be <hi>Due</hi> to him; and whilst we are under his Obedience, we must be Passive, and have no liberty in this sort to resist him.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine of Passive Obedience, and Non-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, seems both most plainly prescribed by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and most sutable to the Spirit and Genius of Holy Religion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi> Commandment, under the name of <hi>Honor,</hi> injoyns both <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>Support</hi> of Princes, as our Politick <hi>Fathers.</hi> But when Subjects make War upon them, instead of paying <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Reverence,</hi> they are plainly in a state of <hi>bidding Defiance:</hi> and when the Sword is unsheathed against them, that is evidently not for their <hi>Support,</hi> but for the <hi>beating and pulling of them Down.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>Christianity, is a <hi>Doctrine of the Cross,</hi> which is one of its Distinguishing Marks; nothing, in account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, being more necessary, more proper, and praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, than for Christians, to <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. x.38.

lay on: it is plain they profess not to Resist, which is out of the way of bearing, but to shew Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Obedience under them. For there is an end of taking up, and bearing Crosses, when, instead of taking up and bearing, Men set themselves with all their might to shake them off, or beat them back again.</p>
            <p>These passages, and such like, do sufficiently bear out the Duty of <hi>Non-Resistance,</hi> even to the most ordinary Understandings, if they will but attend to them. Besides, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> has <note n="†" place="margin">Rom. xiii.2.</note> told us in express terms, that <hi>they who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the Higher Powers, shall receive to themselves damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this was true, say the Advocates of Resistance, at those times, and in those Cases, for which these Rules were given. But those were, where the wills of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors were Laws, or where the Laws brought Cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: not where the Laws, as it is with us, are a Cover against them. <hi>Religion</hi> it self, say they, doth not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorise Resistance; but <hi>Civil Right</hi> doth. And if Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is by Law made a <hi>Civil Right,</hi> we may Resist for it, as we may for other Civil Rights and Properties. Not being bound by any of these Precepts, to bear Crosses which the Law keeps off. Nor tyed to submission, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der invasion of Civil Rights, which carry with them a power to rise in Defence thereof.</p>

                  <hi>Religion, is an internal thing.</hi> It doth not hang with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, as the things of the world; but is inward, in the mind. It is lodged in our hearts, and is to dwell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Spirits. <hi>The Kingdom of God is within you,</hi> says our Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> xvii.2. It consists in a <note n="†" place="margin">Jo. iii.3. and 2 Cor. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>New Nature,</hi> and <hi>the Renewal of the mind,</hi> says S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> xii.2. It lies in <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> which are Spiritual and internal things. Their Power, and Excellence, take life from, and are seated in the inner Man: though they are expressed and made visible, in the outward Conversation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:61813:7"/>And depending thus purely upon our own Minds, it may equally subsist under all the alterations of this World, whether Prosperity or Adversity, Peace or Persecutions. To believe, and to do Right, which is the whole of Religion, is alike practicable under all times, and in all Circumstances. And whether we shall do thus or no, is not in the power of others, but, under God, only of our own wills. This makes the rewarda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of Faith and Obedience, that they are to be the Oblation of our own good will, and we are to chuse them. It also shews the Excellence thereof, that, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on our own will, nothing else, which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver force our wills, can rob us of them. These virtues, lodged in a truly good heart, are like <hi>a Treasure laid up in Heaven, where no thief can break through, or steal,</hi> Mat. vi.20. No Powers, that can force away from us any outward things, are able to storm our Hearts, or force what is within us, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Good Conscience,</hi> or that <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> which is the consequent thereof. <hi>Your joy,</hi> says our Lord to his Disciples, <hi>no man taketh from you,</hi> Jo. xvi.22.</p>
               <p>And from this, I shall note <hi>two</hi> Points fit to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in this case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, Others force, can never make us lose Religion.</hi> For no force can reach it, not being placed among things, that are liable to be forced away, but lodged in the Heart. Any outward force upon us, must stop at the outside of us: or, if it pierce further, it will force away our Lives, before it reach our Hearts. Nay, when it comes there, it may force our Hearts out of our Bodies; but it cannot force our Religion out of our Hearts, unless we please. Our Hearts, where Religion reigns, are only in the hand of God, and of ourselves.</p>
               <p>Indeed, Religion, whilst professed in this World, by the blessing of God, has oft much of the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this World. And these worldly advantages


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61813:8"/>
and encouragements, are subject to the same force as all other worldly things, and may be taken away by violence. And the losing of what is worldly about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in the eye of worldly Wisdom is the losing of Religion. It thinks Religion is gone, when the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Recompences and Inducements about it are: and that to keep Religion in the Land, it must be sure to keep them here. And accordingly, when Persecution comes, whose business is to force away these worldly goods from Religion, it asks, What will become of Religion? But all this while it considers not, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is a spiritual thing, which can subsist without these worldly encouragements: that it looks all at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother World, and so can continue the same it was, when bereft of all the good things of this World: that, tho it may have things without in possession, yet is it none of them; but lives it self and is lodged with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, where no force can come, but where it can keep whether outward Force will or no. What would these worldly wise men have said, had they lived in the days of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles?</hi> For then they would have been called to embrace Religion, and at the same time to leave this World; and have seen Religion thrive, when it had nothing worldly about it: and all that Persecution can do at any time, is only to bring it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this, which was its Primitive State. But Religion is not lost then, but kept and upheld, and subsists as truly as it did the first day it appeared, and all the time it was growing up, and making its way over all that opposed it, in the unconverted World. This, in Christianity must pass for a certain Maxim, that, <hi>Tho ill Arts, to keep off Persecution, may, and in Gods just Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ordinarily do; yet Persecution it self never shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the Church.</hi> Our blessed Lord has given us his own word for this; <hi>The gates of Hell,</hi> i.e. all the powers of Darkness, <hi>shall not prevail against the Church.</hi>


                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:61813:8"/>
Mat. xvi.18. and Persecution is one of their main and strongest Batteries.</p>
               <p>Yea, Persecution doth not waste, but improve and increase Religion. It destroys it, among worldly wise men, who are driven from any thing by worldly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations. So that if any are religious only, or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from worldly motives, they will quit and give it up for worldly losses: and worldly Wisdom, rating who will keep, or who will forego it, only on world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prospects; it concludes Religion, if not quite lost, must needs be mightily brought down, almost to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, by Persecutions.</p>
               <p>But 'tis otherwise, in the eye of Spiritual Prudence. For that knows it, as I say, to be seated in mens hearts, and free wills; and so to be without the reach of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward force and devastations. And that its genuine and proper supports, which it stands on there, are not the good things of this, but the future hopes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of another World, which no Persecutors can take from us. So that when they have done their worst, and despoiled us of what is most valuable in this World; yet all that is still left, which <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> the Author thereof has offered to support it. Nay, that, instead of being abated, is heightned, by what they take from us. Because, the more we suffer for our Duty here, the more we are to hope, and expect to receive hereafter. The other world, which is to make men religious, and to support Religion, is not only as much, but a great deal more for us, when we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Persecutions, than when we are under none.</p>
               <p>Indeed Persecution, leaving no external visible support, is the truest Tryal of Pretenders to Religion, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers, who follow it mainly for the sake of what is not its own, viz. <hi>Present indemnity at least, if not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence and incouragement</hi>; and who, for the sake of what is, viz. <hi>future and unseen Rewards.</hi> They are a


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61813:9"/>
                  <hi>Touch-stone,</hi> to try Hearts and Tempers, <hi>that they who are approved,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> says in case of <hi>Heresies</hi> and <hi>Schisms, may be made manifest,</hi> 1 Cor. xi.19. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly in the Scriptures, we read of <hi>Tryals</hi> and <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,</hi> meaning Persecutions, 1 Cor. x.13. Jam. i.2. and of <hi>the fiery Tryal,</hi> or Furnace of Affliction, that fines and purges the Gold from the Dross, 1 Pet. iv.12. <note n="†" rend="inter">

                  <hi>Persecution is not only most worthy of God, but, as I may so say, necessary to him, for the probation or reprobation of his Servants,</hi> says <hi>Tertul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And making this discrimination, it will lessen the number of the external Professors of Religion. It strikes off all <hi>the seed sown in thorny ground,</hi> which can be <hi>choaked by the cares of this World,</hi> Mat. xiii.7.22. And those on <hi>the stony ground too,</hi> who have <hi>no</hi> sufficient <hi>Root</hi> of Religion, but too much of this World, and whose Root, lying almost at the Surface, is soon scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and parched up when <hi>the heat of Persecution comes,</hi> ver. 5.6.21. It is <hi>the Fan,</hi> as <note n="‖" rend="inter">
                     <hi>Pala illa quae &amp; nunc Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicam aream purgat, eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siam scilicet, confusum acer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum fidelium eventilans, fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum Martyrum, &amp; paleas Negatorum.</hi> ib.</note> 
                  <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> says, <hi>that purges the Lords floor, winnowing the Church, which till then is a confused heap of Professors, and separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Chaff and light Corn from the good Wheat,</hi> the nominal from the real, the Christians of this World from those of a better.</p>
               <p>But it takes off no Right Christians, who are not Right, so long as any thing can make them desert their Saviour, or any Duty of his Religion, when they are call'd by him to own and stick to them. <hi>If any man love Father or Mother, or his own Life more than me, he is not worthy of me.</hi> Mat. x.37.39. Luc. xiv.26. <hi>If he take not his Cross and follow me, he is not worthy of me.</hi> Mat. x.38. <hi>If he doth not bear his Cross and come after me, he cannot be my Disciple.</hi> Luk. xiv.27.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:61813:9"/>As for those who are right true Christians, Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution perfects them. It takes them off from fleshly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and cures their inordinate love and complacence in, or hankerings after this World. It makes them sit loose to it, and have a generous contempt thereof. It heightens their pious Resolutions, instead of abating them; it doth not stop their Carier in duty, but enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it. It begets in them a triumphant disdain of the Injuries or Reproaches, that are thrown upon them for doing a good thing; and a complacence in the Cross, instead of a displeasure with themselves, when it meets them in a good Cause. For in these Sufferings, having the support of God's Promises, the comfort of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the applause of a good Conscience; they are not only patient under their Lot, but satisfied with it: they do not only bear their Burden, but glory and rejoyce therein. <hi>Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you and persecute you for righteousness sake. Rejoyce then and be exceeding glad,</hi> says our Lord, Mat. v.10, 11, 12. Luc. vi.22, 23. <hi>Count it not strange, but rejoyce, in as much as ye are partakers of Christs sufferings, that ye may be also of his glory.</hi> Under such Sufferings, <hi>happy are ye, for the spirit of God rests upon you,</hi> says S. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. iv.12, 13, 14. Accordingly, says S. <hi>Paul, I take pleasure in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christs sake,</hi> 2 Cor. xii.10. and the <hi>Hebrews took joyfully the spoiling of their goods, knowing they had in Heaven, a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more enduring substance.</hi> Heb. x.34. A state of Persecution, is the most advantageous time for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian to appear perfect in; and passive Virtues, are the best Ornament, and most compleat Dress, wherein he can shew and recommend himself. He is never so good, so glorious, and great, as when he is bravely and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedly doing his Duty, and confessing under the Cross of Christ. Nay, put the worst that can come, that such a religious man be cut off, and dye for his


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61813:10"/>
Religion: yet even then must no man prophanely ask, <hi>What is become of Religion?</hi> For that is then become which should become of it, <hi>viz.</hi> to carry the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors thereof to be everlastingly happy in Heaven. And by their dying for it, which is more, no hurt but good will come to Religion among those that survive.</p>
               <p>For Persecution, as it perfects, so it spreads and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagates truly religious men. If Religion thereby loses out-side Professors, it gets sincere and faithful Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The Church loses not so much by the Sufferings, as it gets by the Examples of the holy and <hi>blessed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.</hi> For these strangely affect, and strike upon the Spirits of men. Their Faith, and Patience, and other noble Virtues, shew men the power, and excite their curiosity, and mightily dispose them to hearken, and inquire into the truth of what they suffer for. So that <hi>Semen est sanguis Christianorum, the blood of the Martyrs was the seed of the Church,</hi> as <note n="†" place="margin">

                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> says they found by experience in the Sufferings of the ancient Church.

There is a witness in the blood of Saints, that begets Faith in Beholders: and therefore among the <hi>Three, that bear Witness</hi> to Christ <hi>on Earth,</hi> S. <hi>John</hi> reckons <hi>the blood</hi> for one; <hi>the Spirit, the Water, and the Blood,</hi> meaning thereby their Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in his Cause. 1 Jo. v.8. And S. <hi>Paul,</hi> noting <hi>the signs of an Apostle,</hi> who was to persuade and get be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in others, tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> they <hi>were wrought among them in all patience.</hi> 2 Cor. xii.12. Their Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, were one proof of their being <hi>Gods Ministers. In all things,</hi> saith he, <hi>approving our selves as the Ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, necessities, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses,</hi>


                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:61813:10"/>
and Persecutions of every sort, as well as <hi>by the word of truth,</hi> and <hi>by the</hi> gifts of Miracles or the <hi>power of God,</hi> 2 Cor. vi.4, 5, 7. The Patterns and the Prayers, the passive Graces and Sufferings of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Saints and Martyrs, as well as their Preaching and miraculous powers were a cause that spread Religion so strangely under the primitive Persecutions: instead of cutting off, it was really a Widener, and a true prolifick Principle and Seed of the Church.</p>
               <p>Thus doth God turn this great rule of worldly Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom into mere Folly. In this, he absolutely <hi>confounds the wisdom of the Wise,</hi> and <hi>takes the</hi> fleshly <hi>Wise,</hi> as the Scripture says, <hi>in their own craftiness,</hi> and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates how <hi>the Wisdom of this World is Foolishness with God.</hi> 1 Cor. iii.19, 20. When Persecutions go to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the Religious, they do not pull down, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate and advance Religion. When they destroy and cut off some, they drive in more, and Religion gets new ones in their room. It loses none but out-side or insincere Professors, but increases in the number of hearty and upright Followers, who are the true honor of Religion and ornament of the Church.</p>
               <p>From this I observe, how we must not say with worldly wise men, that <hi>worldly ease and immunities are best for Religion.</hi> Indeed, outward Peace and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, are things very valuable and acceptable to its Professors, as their place of professing it is here in this World, and whilst they bear about them fleshly Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. But, as we must thankfully value, and improve it, when we have it; so must we consider too, that Religion it self, and the Spirit, (tho the Flesh be of another mind) may be bettered by the want thereof. And therefore, that is but fit in this case, to leave God to take his own way, and chuse for us. And if at any time he is bringing Persecution on, 'tis not for us to step out of his way to keep it off, and excuse our selves by saying, <hi>it is better for Religion.</hi> For when was it


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61813:11"/>
ever better for the Church, than in the <hi>first Ages,</hi> when they run thro the most, and forest Persecutions? Is not that best for the Church, which makes the most and the best good Christians? And when were they more, or better, in the places where Christianity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd, than in those first and persecuting Ages? Were not those times, a continual, and vast increase, of fresh Converts? And were not those Converts of much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more Christian Lives, under this Discipline of Persecutions, than others use to be in times of Peace and secular Advantages?</p>
               <p>And on the other hand, to abate the advantage of worldly Peace and Possessions, are not they too liable to carnalize and corrupt the Spirits of men? Do not the worldly Possessions, which were design'd to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage men in the way and ministry of Religion, too oft steal their hearts away from it? and then, when a Persecution comes for any necessary Truth or Duties sake, instead of being a friend and support, are not they an Enemy within the Walls, to betray and deliver it up? The sad experience of such general and shameful Defections from religious Truths, to hold their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Possessions, made <hi>Faustinus</hi> and <hi>Marcellinus</hi> in their Book of Prayers to the Emperors, to call them <note n="*" place="margin">

And when God sends Persecution, it is both the School wherein to shew forth this rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed temper of mind, and wherein to improve and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it. 'Tis not for us therefore to say, it is better for Religion, but only for Flesh and Blood whilst they profess Religion, to be out of Persecution. For when God sees fit to send it upon his Church, as he always doth when they cannot shun it without Sin: he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, and will undoubtedly effect it, to purge and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie, to perfect and promote, true and acceptable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Godliness thereby. And all that <hi>loses,</hi> is only mixt and mongrel Professors, and our own world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and carnal selves.</p>
               <p>Such, is the real importance of Persecution, to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the Church. It gets more thereby, than it loses. It is deprived of nominal, mixt Professors; but aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with better Christians. Tho it should shew fewer Professors; yet can it at such times produce more, and more perfect Saints, and Heirs of eternal Happiness. It takes from its faithful Followers, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, not spiritual; present, not future. So that it destroys, or lessens it, only in the opinion of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minds or fleshly prudence, who look only at what is kept or lost of this Worlds goods and advantages: but advances, confirms, and multiplies it in the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the spiritually minded, and according to the esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of true <hi>Christian</hi> Prudence.</p>
               <p>Like to this, of others <hi>Force</hi> not making us lose Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is another Observation, of <hi>others Force not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the effect of our Ministry.</hi> This is wont to be one Plea at such times. For as the People are ready to say, they take Arms against their persecuting Prince, that they may not be deprived of the benefit of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters: so among the Ministers themselves, are some tempted to stretch and go greater lengths in comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance therewith, than they think their duty allows, <hi>on

pretence of serving God, and keeping in to do good in their places. If we stick at this, say some, what will become of our Ministry, and the exercise thereof? and what way can we have, to do God service in our stations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, If this has any force at all, it seems to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Gods own ordering, as if in this disposal of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, he had called us from a better way to a worse, and in debarring and discharging us from our former Stations, (as he doth, when we can no longer hold them without sin,) had summoned us to a less useful Post to serve him in. But a mind that truly and sincerely seeks to serve God, and not, under an hypocritical pretence thereof, to serve its worldly interests, will easily give him leave, when he sees fit, to change the scene of our service, and to chalk out and call us, as he pleases, to the place where, and the Station in which he will be served. And besides, the external force, tho it drive us out of our Stations, will not take us away at such times, from doing him service. For, besides what we have opportunity then to do for him, we may serve him more by suffering in a good way, than we ever should be able to do by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Stations through a bad one. Nay, our suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for a good Cause, may be like to be of more real use and influence, than all our Preaching up the same Cause might be, without suffering. There is a Witness in the Blood, as I observed, and a persuasiveness in the sufferings of Martyrs and Confessors, which affects and convinces more, than any words or Sermons they could use. Let us then, on such occasions, take care to suffer <hi>Christianly,</hi> and leave it to Gods care to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply any want of us in our Stations, and to serve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by our sufferings, more than it were possible for us to serve him by any other ways.</p>
               <p>And as others Force, can never make us lose Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: so neither</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>When Force and Persecution comes upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> especially from <hi>our Governors,</hi> in the Eye of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61813:12"/>
Wisdom, <hi>is our armed Resistance, or encountring Force by Force, a way to defend and preserve Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If our Force be a way to preserve any thing at such times, it is the worldly appendages of Religion: <hi>viz.</hi> our Secular Profits, Civil Liberties, Powers, Honors, and other Advantages, which the Laws have conferred and settled in favor of the Truth, and given the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors thereof a Title to. What it can have any pretence to, is to guard worldy things, possessed by Religious Men, as they are Members of this World, as well as Professors of Religion. And if it come in to guard worldly things, it is on the score of worldly Prudence, and is made use of by the Religious, not as <hi>Religious,</hi> but as <hi>worldly wise.</hi> Tho, as to Publick Force for redress of Publick Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, however to the aggrieved, before they have tryed, it may seem otherwise, I think it is a most unwise course: and instead of preserving what part of those worldly things was endangered, it brings all into much greater danger, and to secure one part, throws away se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral. Adding only this for our Recompence, that instead of losing and suffering a little, against the grain of our angry Passions; it throws us into the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of a great deal more, but in the pleasure and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of them.</p>
               <p>But as to Religion, it is <hi>not outward Force,</hi> but <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience, Prayer and good Practice,</hi> which is the way to preserve it. This may seem a Riddle in the Eye of worldly Wisdom, and pass not for the Prudence, but for the folly of Religious Men. But this <hi>foolishness of God,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks, <hi>is wiser than men</hi>; and this seeming <hi>weakness of God, is stronger than</hi> any boasted force of <hi>men,</hi> 1. Cor. i.25. And when their magnified ways, by Humane Confidences, and an Arm of Flesh, instead of preserving, betray and undermine the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion they fight for, and these <hi>worldly-wise</hi> are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by, as they promised themselves, but <hi>taken in their own Crastiness:</hi> this despised way of Faith, and


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61813:13"/>
Patience, and good Prayers, which builds on God and not upon our selves, and which he counts wise, though they count foolish, is found not only to preserve, but to promote it, and to make it glorious and triumphant. Thus it did in greater Tryals and Persecutions, than any God has proved his Church withal in these later Ages. And it will still have the same effect, to those who dare trust God with Religion and themselves, and allow his Providence and Promises, to make up to them, what Humane appearances do to Carnal Politician. <hi>In your Patience, possess ye your souls,</hi> or <hi>preserve ye them,</hi> the word <gap reason="foreign">

Luke xxi.19. <hi>He that will save his life shall lose it; and be that will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it,</hi> said he in those times, when Mens necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, would make them listen after all Human Arts and Devices, to save themselves. Luke ix.24. <hi>In returning and rest, shall you be saved, in quietness and confidence shall be your strength, your strength is to sit still,</hi> said God by <hi>Isaiah</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> when, in their distress, they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising themselves more relief from the unlawful aid of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and from tumultuary ways. <hi>Is.</hi> xxx.7.15.</p>
               <p>This is to be taken off, indeed, from Human strengths, and staid on Providence. But that makes it only a greater tryal of Faith, not a weaker remedy and method of relief. For when all is done, the last and best security is <hi>Providence.</hi> And the surest way to fix that in our favour, is this of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience.

Yea, though innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Wolves compass us about on every side, we shall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served safe, and get the better of them. But if, instead of continuing like Sheep among Wolves, we turn Wolves our selves, and put on wolfish Natures; then are we like to be overcome, as being left to our selves. For, then the Shepherd withdraws his help from us, who feeds and watches over the Sheep only, not over the Wolves. When thou turnest thy self into a Wolf, away he presently goes, and leaves thee, as one that reliest no longer on his strength, but beginnest to trust to thy own, and sufferest not his Power to be made manifest in thee. For when, being vexed with injuries, thou sufferest all with a mild and equal mind, not standing up to fight for thy self, but trusting to him to fight for thee: thou attributest to him the whole triumph of the day. But if, instead of suffering like a Sheep, thou shalt stand up to tear and devour like a Wolf, and go out and fight against the Enemy: by that thou hidest and darkenest the glory of his Victory. — Though this way of Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and Patience, seem to Men the most unmeet to Cure, or Guard against our Persecutors violence:</hi> yet, says he, <hi>God that knows better, what is like be effective with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature, than Men themselves do, knows that bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is not wont to be broken and extinguished by boldness,


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61813:14"/>
but by mildness. And of this we see plain experience in the holy Apostles. Who, as oft as the people of the</hi> Jews <hi>rose against them, and sharpened their Teeth upon them, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated the Dove, as our Lord requires, and by answering them with a becoming mildness and moderation, overcame their Anger, extinguished their Fury, and retarded their hasty and violent motions. For when they said, have we not charged you over and over, that you should not teach in this Name? Although they could have wrought infinite Miracles, yet they neither spoke, nor acted any thing harsh and provoking, but apologizing for themselves with all mildness, said, whether it be just to hearken to you, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than unto God, judge ye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such, as that <hi>good Father</hi> truly observed, is the prosperous issue of this course of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience.</hi> And that when there is nothing promising in Human ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, but all rests on Faith in God, or reliance on Providence. When the Sheep are to arm themselves, with nothing but Simplicity and Mansuetude in the midst of Wolves, <hi>what consolation,</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Ibid.</note>saith he, <hi>can there be for them? Only the power of him that sends them. Therefore this he sets in the first place, loe! I send you — He that could have made them, that, as Lions, they should have struck terror into others; thought fit rather to order, that they should come as Sheep among terrifying Wolves: for that makes you more illustrious, and better declares my power and strength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I have here said, to note the wisdom and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfulness of this way, of <hi>trusting God for Relief,</hi> by keeping to his way of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> when his Vice-Gerents Persecute us: and not stepping out there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of into any forbidden ways, as warlike force, in trust to an Arm of Flesh, at the suggestion of worldly Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And though this is not wisdom, to those that look only at Human Appearances: yet it will be found so, by those that mark events, and the Ways and Rules


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61813:14"/>
of Providence. For God sets himself against this worldly wisdom, and turns it into foolishness, to take Men off from trusting in an Arm of Flesh. And speeds and prospers this other method of spiritual Wisdom, by surprizes of Success, and invisible interpositions, and turns and ways never thought of till brought to pass; to call us all to rely on Providence, whilst, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining our selves to his ways, we place our Faith and Trust in himself, as they who please may find more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discoursed, in a Treatise of <hi>Christian Prudence,</hi> Ch. 8.</p>
               <p>Thus, is Religion to be preserved, by Faith, and Patience, and Spiritual Methods; and not by Force: it cannot be taken by Force, and so needs not be kept by it.</p>
               <p>Nay, instead of being preserved by Force, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired thereby, when it is used in its behalf. They are much deceived, that fansie War will do good to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Instead of that, the force and fighting of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Men, are the greatest violence to Religion. Tho it gets by the Force it suffers, it lofes mightily by the Force it uses. When Force gets within it, and mixes with it, whilst it seeks to preserve the Shell, it consumes the Kernel, and pretending to Guard the Body, it eats out the very Heart of it.</p>
               <p>For Religion it self, lies mightily in Love and Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence: <hi>He that loves another, hath fulfilled the law,</hi> Rom. xiii.10. <hi>A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another,</hi> Joh. xiii.34. <hi>And by this shall all men know that ye are my Disciples, if ye have love one to another,</hi> vers. 35. But, instead of Love and Benificence; Wars and Fightings lye all in angry passions, and doing mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. It, is shown in forgiving; that, in avenging Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. It, in doing good for ill; that, in doing all the ill men can. It, in mourning, with those that mourn; and rejoycing, with those that rejoyce: that, in mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Mirth, and rejoycing over the Cries and


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61813:15"/>
Grief of others. It, in loving our Neighbour, as our selves; yea, our Enemies that hate us, tho without a cause; or, our Persecutors, that hate us for the best things: but that, in hating and persecuting all as Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, having no regard to good or ill, Relations or Strangers, Friends or Foes. That, is tender of all the Things and Rights, both of God and Men: this of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, sparing neither things sacred nor profane, and counting all it can take its own, and Spoil and Rapine, Waste and Devastation, no wrong. That, is for saving of Lives, in regard to community of Natures, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to Gods Image: this, for destroying them. By these, and many more that might be added, it appears how Religion is calculated for a state of Peace: so that whensoever War bursts out, and is put in practice, the greater part of its Duties are under suspension, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Violence. I do not say it forbids all Wars: in compliance with the state and necessities of this World, on just and great Causes, it connives and gives way to them. But this it doth by no means, as a way to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote it self, or advance the observance of its Rules, which are in so great measure no Rules at all, whilst War reigns. And therefore what it doth in this case, is only to tolerate it: it allows, but it doth not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage, or persuade to it.</p>
               <p>Besides, as the Liberties of War run counter to so great a body of its Rules; so, in time of War, there is also the usual restraint taken off, and impunity added to all Wickedness. They are, too often, then most in power, who are better Soldiers, than Christians; and have the least sense of Religion and Conscience. Then a shole of irreligious Tempers, as Pride, Insolence, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, Uncompassionateness, Anger, Revenge, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness, Ambition, Neglect of the things of God and Religion, or open profanation of them: in a word, all vicious and corrupt Passions are superinduced upon the


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61813:15"/>
minds of men, which are a revival of the old man, and most opposite to the very life and design of true Religion. So that Religion it self, is not like to have any good, more than the civil State is, by Wars. Its Professors, will in the end be worse by it, in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as well as in their Fortunes. They will come out, more opposite to God, and the Temper of Saints, and so be worse Christians.</p>
               <p>Yea, not only as to its <hi>moral Practice</hi>; but even as to <hi>Orthodoxy of Profession,</hi> and <hi>Purity of Worship,</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, instead of being reform'd and amended, by the just Judgment of God, and the natural course of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Passions, is too oft made a great deal worse, by warring against our Governors. A spiritual defection many times accompanies a civil one; as the <hi>Israelites,</hi> with <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> fell off <hi>from God to the Calves,</hi> when they had <hi>revolted from the house of Solomon.</hi> And in our late <hi>long civil Wars,</hi> when they rebell'd for Religion, by Rebellion against the King, was a strange defection in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced from Christianity; <note n="‖" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Such, in reality, is the difference between our suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering others Force in Persecutions, and our using Force our selves, by listing Armies for Religion against our persecuting Rulers. We may practise all the parts of Religion, whilst they are forcing us; several, that have no place in external peace and quietness; and all, with more perfection and honor than at other times: so that


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61813:16"/>
in suffering the force of Persecutors, Religion it self gets, whatever else loses; and its Rules, have more true and tryed, more perfect and triumphant Observance, than they could have otherwise. But when we come to use force our selves, to defend Religion against our persecuting Governors; in this time of force, we lay aside the greater part of its Rules, and give a loose to all degenerate and vicious Tempers, utterly opposite to its habits: so that, whatever else gets, it loses.</p>
               <p>And therefore in spiritual Wisdom, which wisely seeks the growth of religious tempers on the minds of men, and the advancement of Faith and good Practice; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is not to be defended, or preserved, by our ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Arms against its and our Persecutors. It would live and thrive, be preserved and prosper'd, by our suffering: but, when to preserve those mundane Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges which are tack'd to it, we go to War, it is sure to be worsted by our fighting. <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd it, is stiled, not the <hi>Lord of Hosts,</hi> or <hi>God of Battels,</hi> but the <hi>Prince of Peace:</hi> and the Gospel, which contains it, is the <hi>Gospel of Peace.</hi> So, 'tis our keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Quiet, not running to Arms, that best suits it, and must do it good.</p>

                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:61813:16"/>Their Plea is, That the Scripture Precepts, of <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and <hi>Submission,</hi> and <hi>not-resisting higher Powers,</hi> but <hi>bearing crosses under them; were not design'd for Sufferers in all cases, but only for Sufferers according to Laws.</hi> They forbid all liberty of resisting, not absolutely, say <note n="‖" place="margin">
                     <hi>See the Authors cited</hi> p. 2.</note> they, to every man: but to him only, that has the Laws against him; or, who suffers under a Prince, whose Will is his Law, and without any Law to cover him. But, where men suffer in their civil Rights; or, where Religion suffers, that stands by Law, and is taken into the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects civil Properties; especially where they suffer an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion of most important Rights, or a breach upon the Constitution it self: those Precepts, they say, forbid not Resistance in such cases, nor were they given, or intended for any such Sufferers. And tho the nature of Religion will not, yet the nature of civil Right, they think will authorize men, notwithstanding those Gospel Injunctions, to arm in defence thereof.</p>
               <p>I take this to be a great, and most lamentable perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of those Gospel Precepts, which were given to men that had legal Rights, and suffer'd the most illegal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasions of them. And to clear this point, I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to shew, how under the most heinous and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Invasions, that oppressive Sovereigns have made upon Laws and Rights; God has still call'd Subjects to this Non-Resistance. And how such Invasions gave no exemptions therefrom, either to the <hi>Christians,</hi> under the persecuting Emperors; nor to the <hi>Jews,</hi> under their Kings; nor is allow'd to exempt <hi>us,</hi> by our own Laws. Nay, if this plea, of <hi>defensibleness of legal Rights,</hi> can exempt us: I think it will be found, that a like defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibleness of natural Rights, would as well exempt all other Subjects, and so leave no such duty in the World, as <hi>Passive Obedience.</hi> There being as good Authority, to defend our natural Rights this way, against persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Laws; as there is to defend any legal Rights, against illegal Persecutors.</p>

               </p>
               <p>These were the Rules of Christian Subjection, under all the aforesaid Emperors, whereby the Christians of that, and of the ensuing Ages, were to govern themselves. And these, do not teach taking up Arms against inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Princes; but passive Obedience or Non-resistance under them. And that at a time, when the invasion of Rights, was most crying and notorious; and in the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derest points, both of Life, Power, and Fortunes. And when they had not merely the nature of Right to plead, as implying a power, as some say now, of forcible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence

even against the Prince himself, should he offer to infringe it. But when also, <note n="‖" place="margin">P.

That is, a Law of <hi>Valerius,</hi> from this, and other such like Laws passed in his <hi>Consulship,</hi> sirnamed <hi>Publicola,</hi> as <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Dec.</hi> 1. <hi>l.</hi> 2.</note>

               </p>
               <p>And indeed, the meaning of all the Gospel Precepts, of <hi>taking up the Cross, Patience,</hi> and <hi>Non-resistance,</hi> must needs be meant of <hi>Invaders of Rights,</hi> whether natural or civil, matters not much, as I shall shew afterwards. For where are the Crosses, what place for Patience, or what provocation to Resistance, under the Maintainers of Rights or righteous Rulers? There is difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Patience and Non-resistance of Criminals, and the Patience and Non-resistance of Christians. That is, when they suffer according to Right; this, when against Right: that, when they suffer for ill; this, when for good and rewardable things. <hi>If, when ye suffer for your faults, ye take that patiently, what glory is it to you? But, if when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, that is acceptable with God.</hi> 1 Pet. ii.19, 20. So that to pretend we are for Passive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and yet, not to be for suffering, but resisting, when our Rights are invaded; seems as much as to say, we are always for it, but when we are call'd to use it. Good Kings, will not punish, but reward good men and well-doers; and that will afford, but very little tryal of their Passive Obedience.</p>
               <p>Under the <hi>Successors</hi> of these <hi>Emperors,</hi> the Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Christians, were carried on still by the <hi>breach of Rights.</hi> Not only the Rights of God, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: as all their Persecutions, were a reverse of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,

and usurping a Power to punish and torment his servants, for obeying him. But by a <hi>breach</hi> of the <hi>Rights of the Empire</hi> too.</p>
               <p>To clear this I observe, that though the <hi>Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,</hi> had a very large and extensive Power, much wider than is injoyed by our Kings, and as absolute by the <hi>Lex Regia,</hi> as could well consist with the <hi>Government of a Free People</hi>: yet was <hi>this Imperial Power, to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred by stated Laws, and to consist with popular freedoms and immunities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In several things, the Emperor was bound up <hi>to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Subject,</hi> not having a plenary Power to act alone, without the <hi>concurrence of the Senate.</hi> Such was <hi>the Consecrating of any new God</hi>; which, as <note n="†" place="margin">Apol. p. 6. c. 13.</note>

               <p>And therefore, when the Emperors, after all the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Senate and People, had by Law been transferr'd on them, were styled <hi>absolute:</hi> that is, not as being loose in their Administration, from all Laws, or popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Immunities.

Yet still so, as to be Governors of Free born Subjects, not of Slaves. And to administer the several parts of their Power, by the Laws of the Empire; as the other Magistrates, ere it was taken out of their hands, had done before, Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, whilst those Laws were in force, and before they themselves, when possessed of the Legislative in such sort as might consist with the Liberties of a Free People, had alter'd or revoked any that were legally revocable, by <hi>Regular Repeals.</hi> Whilst any Laws were in force, those Laws, as I noted from <hi>Cicero,</hi> were to model the Courts, and guide the Sentences. And S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> afterwards, who had himself been first an <hi>Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,</hi> and then a <hi>Judge of the Empire in Civil Affairs,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Yea, even the <hi>Persians</hi> themselves, whose Princes did so exceed in Prerogative; yet in the height of their absolute Power, were not loose from inviolable Laws, however few those Laws were, or free they were from being call'd to account, for any Breaches of them. For the Scripture tells us, of <hi>the Laws of Medes and Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which alter not.</hi> Esth. i.19. and Dan. vi.8.12.15.

               <p>Thus were the <hi>Roman Emperors,</hi> not merely <hi>arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> but <hi>limited Governors,</hi> who were to Rule their People according to <hi>stated Laws.</hi> And the <hi>Roman Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> were <hi>privileged Subjects,</hi> who lived under the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and Protection of <hi>Legal Rights, Freedoms, and Properties</hi>; for which they had as good Law, as the Emperor had for his Prerogatives, and whereof they could not be despoiled, without Violence to the Law and legal Constitution, whereupon the Emperor himself stood.

               <p>For what now said the Holy Bishops, and Fathers to their Flocks, in Point of Passive Obedience or Non-Resistance, to these illegal Oppressors, and Invaders of Civil Rights and Immunities? The forementioned Precepts of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> they make their Rules, esteeming them, as all Christians ought to do, for <hi>Catholick Precepts,</hi> given to guide Christians of every time and place, and that ought to bind up their own hands, in those hard and trying Days; as, in foregoing times, they had bound up the hands of their Predecessors.

to afford it; according to some present Casuists way of stating this Question: Why might not the Christians, have thought themselves discharged, from paying any thing to these Emperors?</p>
               <p>There was <hi>nothing of Law,</hi> but <hi>arbitrariness in all their Courts,</hi> where <hi>Galerius,</hi> as I noted above,<note n="*" place="margin">ib. c. 22.</note>

And if there is no Allegiance due to a lawful Governor, when he lays aside the Laws, and breaks in upon the Constitution it self, such an one being no longer the Governor their Law and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution owns: the Christians might have been free in Conscience to look to themselves, and to stand up with others for their common Defence, against all his barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and illegal Usage.</p>
               <p>I will add but one Plea more. There was a treating of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and other Subjects of the Empire, more like <hi>Enemies</hi> than <hi>Subjects.</hi> Thus, <hi>Lactantius</hi>

               <p>Thus, had they lived in those days, might the <hi>modern Casuists</hi> and Advocates for Resistance, have urged all the Pleas, of <hi>Invasion of Liberties and Properties; of ceasing of Protection, from unjust Powers</hi>; of <hi>breach of Laws, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of very Forms and fundamental Constitutions</hi>; of <hi>Rulers ceasing to be mentis compotes,</hi> or falling under mental or moral Incapacities, or <hi>their turning publick Enemies,</hi> and the like; against the now exploded Doctrine, of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> and <hi>Non-resistance,</hi> under the <hi>fiery tryal of the primitive Persecutions.</hi> But those blessed Martyrs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, <hi>had not so learned Christ.</hi> These illegal Invaders of Rights, and bloody Persecutors of Religion, they still own'd and suffer'd, as <hi>Gods Vicegerents.</hi> And, as our Lord himself, and his blessed Apostles taught, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised: so these their true Followers took care, even in

               <p>Now as to this, it solves not the Argument, from the Dueness of Non-resistance to <hi>Jewish</hi> or <hi>Israelitish</hi> Kings:


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61813:36"/>
for that was as due to those that wanted, as to those that had these immediate Nominations. It was as due to <hi>Ahab,</hi> and all those other Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> that were such Invaders of Laws and Rights, as I observed, as to <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> or to <hi>Jehu.</hi> And yet, among the Kings of <hi>Israel, Jeroboam,</hi> and <hi>Jehu</hi> alone, had this prophetical Nomination; all the rest coming in by humane Titles, like the Kings of other Nations. And as due to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and <hi>Josiah,</hi> and all the other Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> that were Kings by descent; as to <hi>Saul,</hi> or <hi>David,</hi> who were set up by immediate Message from God. And yet, after <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> the Crown in <hi>Judah,</hi> went by the course of Descent in the Royal Blood, without any Interposition, so far as we can see in Scripture, of Gods personal Nomination. Even in <hi>Joash</hi>'s Case, who was set up against <hi>Athaliah</hi> after <hi>six years</hi> possession, no such thing was pretended. <hi>Jehoiada the Priest,</hi> who managed that Revolution, not pretending for young <hi>Joash,</hi> any Message of a Prophet, or Answer from the Cloud of Glory, which, had that been their method of setting up Kings in those days, he, as <hi>chief Priest,</hi> should have consulted; but only his heritable Right ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Constitution of <hi>Jury,</hi> or being of <note n="†" place="margin">2 Chron. xxiii.3.</note> 
                  <hi>the House of David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides, Non-resistance, and other Duties to Sovereign Governors, do not depend upon the method, or way of coming into Power; but only on that rightful Power and Authority, they are come into. <hi>Honor thy Father, obey Magistrates, submit to the King as supreme, be subject to the Higher Powers,</hi> and other like Sayings of Scripture requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring these Duties, look only at the <hi>Authority.</hi> If a Man is the true Father, the rightful Power, and the lawful King, they ask no more to make all these due to him: making no difference, whether he comes to have this Right, by an Humane Title, or by a Divine.</p>
               <p>Now all that Gods personal Nomination doth, is, as other personal Titles do, to fix the Power in a certain person. It gives no inlargement of Power, or greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61813:36"/>
of Prerogative. And not widening or enlarging the Authority, it can make, or call for no more Duty. And accordingly, these Duties, were as much the due of those Kings, that came in by humane Titles among the <hi>Jews</hi>; as of those, who were personally named by God himself. And they are as due, to any Kings of other Nations, as they were to <hi>Jewish</hi> Kings. For Government, is institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God, for all Nations, as well as <hi>Jury.</hi> And Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Governors, is a natural Duty. So that Subjects of all Governments, are call'd to pay these Duties, as much as the <hi>Jewish Subjects</hi> were. Now to bid men be <hi>subject,</hi> and <hi>submissive,</hi> and <hi>obedient,</hi> and <hi>not to resist,</hi> and the like, are as plain and full, as I noted at first, as the most ordinary Understandings need to be taught, against all Resistance. What said God more than this against Resistance, to the <hi>Jews,</hi> when he named any King himself? Nay, if we come to make Comparisons, where are the Sayings against it, under any such Kings, so numerous and express? And these are as plain, if Men are willing to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what God plainly tells them, when spoken in case of a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, who had a humane Title<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as they would have been, in case of <hi>Saul,</hi> who had a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Title.</p>
               <p>They are due to any persons, as having <hi>Gods Authority,</hi> and being his Vicegerents. Thus <note n="‖" place="margin">Rom. xiii.1, 2.4, 5.</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> notes of <hi>all Duties of Subjects,</hi> and particularly of <hi>Non-resistance,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>They that resist shall receive Damnation,</hi> as resisting <hi>the Powers that be of God,</hi> and <hi>the Ordinance of God,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring <hi>Subjection out of Conscience,</hi> because <hi>they are Gods Ministers.</hi> So that as to matter of Resistance, any other King has the conscionable Bar against it, as much as a King of Gods own naming, if he be but <hi>Gods Minister</hi> and <hi>Ordinance.</hi> But now the Power of Kings by humane Titles, is Gods Power, and God owns this way of coming in, and empowers them as much, as those that come in by his own personal Nomination: declaring, that their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is his Power, and that they are <hi>his Ministers</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</hi>


                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:61813:37"/>
All which, S. <hi>Paul</hi> says as expresly of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, as he could have said of any Prince, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately call'd out, and commission'd by God himself.</p>
               <p>The seditious <hi>Jews,</hi> I conceive were of this Opinion, that the Heathen Powers, not set up by any Revelations, but left to humane Claims, were not <hi>Kings of Gods ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</hi> And so were wont to despise, and speak slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully of them: <hi>Despising Dominion, and speaking evil of Dignities,</hi> as S. <hi>Jude</hi> says of the <hi>Seditious Judaizers,</hi> v. 8. But S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells such Men, that these Powers, were as truly <hi>of God,</hi> as any of their own Nation: and that Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, for obeying Powers, was as much for obeying these, as it had been for obeying them. <hi>There is no power,</hi> saith he, <hi>but of God.</hi> And <hi>he that resists the Power, resists the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God.</hi>

               <p>And like to this, <hi>of the different ways of their coming in, making no difference in our Duties to them, we find in other instances.</hi> In point of <hi>Property,</hi> we come into our Lands and Possessions, by an <hi>humane Law and Allotment</hi>; but they came into theirs in <hi>Canaan,</hi> by a <note n="*" place="margin">Numb. xxvi.53, 54, 55, 56. and cap. xxxiv.13.17.29.</note> 
                  <hi>divine.</hi> But yet there is as much <hi>Stealing,</hi> and a breach of the <hi>eighth</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, in taking away our things from us; as there was, in taking away theirs from them. And in case of <hi>Servitude,</hi> the Primitive Masters came by their <hi>Servants,</hi> either as their <hi>Captives, taken in War</hi>; or as their <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase,</hi> bought with money like their Cattle in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets: but we by <hi>Contract,</hi> all our Servants voluntarily submitting themselves to us, and at their own choice. Yet, for all this different Rise of Masters Powers, when once Servants are got under them, the same Gospel Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, of <hi>Diligence, Fidelity,</hi> and <hi>not answering</hi> again, &amp;c. do equally oblige in both Cases. The Duties respecting either <hi>Power,</hi> or <hi>Property,</hi> depend not on the particular


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61813:37"/>
manure of coming in: but only on the <hi>Rightfulness,</hi> and <hi>Degrees,</hi> of that Power and Property, which any Persons are come in to. More Power, I grant, there is in some Princes, and more Liberties to some Subjects, than to others, according to the difference of Civil Governments and Constitutions. But since the Power of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Kings, was a Power <hi>limited by Laws,</hi> as ours is; an Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Laws and Rights, can no more justifie Resistance in our Case, than it did in theirs. And to say they did not come into this limited and Legal Power the same way, makes no difference as to this business.</p>

But this, as I have shewn, is contrary to the sense of those Gospel Precepts, and to the Belief and Practice of Gospel and Primitive Times. Which tied up the Hands of Christians, when they suffered illegal things, and were treated by their Governors, in numerous and most concerning Points, against the Laws.</p>
               <p>Again, <note n="‖" place="margin">Ib. Art. 10.</note> they say those Precepts were directed <hi>against Jews, who were not for submitting, or paying Allegiance, to Foreiners, or Heathens.</hi> Admit they had one Eye against these: yet, at the same time, they had as much against any others, that would have run into the same <hi>Jewish</hi> Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, or have been for making Warlike Resistance to those Powers, on any other pretences. The thing those Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts are plainly for securing, is <hi>Non-Resistance to those Powers, notwithstanding any thing, that could be alledged against them.</hi> And as the <hi>Jews</hi> might pretend in those days, that they were Foreiners, and Heathens: so might others, and with as much truth too, that they were Invaders of Laws, of Rights, and Liberties. And yet for all these,


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61813:38"/>
or any other pretences Seditious Spirits should start, the <hi>Apostles</hi> peremptorily injoyn all good Christians, to own them still as <hi>Gods Ordinance,</hi> and to forbear all <hi>warlike Resistance</hi> towards them, <hi>not only for wrath, but for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science sake.</hi> And thus, in obedience to those injunctions, they all practised at that time: as their followers did, in the succeeding Persecutions. And the Scriptures are written for a Rule of <hi>Christs</hi> Church, alike in all times: as much to us, as they were to former Ages. So that these Precepts, both of <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testament,</hi> are as binding upon us, as ever they were, upon either the <hi>Jews,</hi> or the <hi>Primitive Christians.</hi> And whatever pretences were pleadable in their Case, whilst the Inspired Pen-men told them they were bound not to Resist: to be sure those same pretences, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Cancel our Obligation more than it did theirs, or make it lawful for us do it. We must follow them to Heaven, in the same way the Apostles taught, and they took; or else we are not like to get thither at all.</p>

For those very Laws, which establish our Religion, and particularly the <hi>Act of Uniformity,</hi> forbid this way of Defence, and <hi>declare it unlawful on any Pretence whatsoever, to take up Arms against the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Declaration was made, upon occasion of the <hi>Great Rebellion</hi> begun in 41. and for preventing any ones falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61813:38"/>
the like again. And therefore, by <hi>any Pretence whatsoever,</hi> it must more particularly include all those Pretences, which were given out for taking Arms at that time. And those Pretences, as may be seen from <hi>the Votes and Declararations of that Parliament,</hi> a brief Account whereof is given in the <hi>View of the late Troubles,</hi> were, the <note n="†" place="margin">Vid. p<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 96, 97, 98, 99.</note>

                  <hi>keeping out of Foreign Forces,</hi> which the King was said to be endeavouring to bring in, to inslave this Kingdom. Which Pretences, are the best that can be invented for Forcible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and so, as oft as they are bent on change, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be made use of, by Men of like Minds in latter Ages.</p>
               <p>Indeed, so far as Words and plain Declarations can do it, our Law seems to have taken all the Care the Wit of Man can take before hand, to prevent all Recourse to this way of Defence against our Lawful Sovereigns, by leaving none in this way to be our Defenders, or capable to pretend a Power of making use thereof. If any could list Armies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the King, not only in Defence of private Rights, but of the Laws, or the very Constitution it self, when the Kings chance to break in upon them: It would certainly be the <hi>two Houses of Parliament.</hi> But the Act about the <hi>Militia</hi> 13. <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 6. and 14. <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 3. declares the Power of the <hi>Militia,</hi> so much contested by the Parliament in King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>First</hi>'s time; yea, and that on this very Pretence, that they might therewith Defend the Laws and Liberties against him: <hi>to be solely in the King. And that neither one, nor both the Houes of Parliament, can, or lawfully may, Levy any War, either Offensive, or Defensive, against him.</hi> So that take even the most Defensible Rights, which seem best to deserve a War; and put them into their Hands, who have the best Claim to be their Defenders: and yet tis plain by this Act, that they are not to defend them against the King, by Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying War, or Listing Soldiers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:61813:39"/>Tis true, our Parliaments are taken into the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and have a share in the Highest Acts, as <hi>making Laws.</hi> Whence some have argued, that upon the Princes Breaking in upon the Legislative Power, the Parliament may take Arms against such an Invader, as one Sovereign may against another. This Inference, is directly against the Act last mentioned, which declares they have no Power against him, either for <hi>any Offensive, or Defensive War.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to clear this Point, this Share of theirs in the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation, as I conceive, is not a <hi>Sovereign's,</hi> but a <hi>Subject's</hi> Part. They are called in to consult, and with Authority of Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, upon all Laws to be imposed on them: which is a great Security, indeed, of their being well-governed, and bound to nothing but what is for their Benefit, no Law being to be made or repealed, without their own Consent. But this Liberty of consulting, and Authority of Negative, is still un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the King the <hi>only Sovereign</hi>; nor on equal Terms with him, as <hi>two Independant Sovereigns.</hi> Agreeably, we find the Stile in the <hi>Acts</hi> so often is, <hi>Be it enacted by the King our Sovereign Lord, with the Assent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and of the Commons in this present Parliament As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled, and by Authority of the same.</hi> As 37.

               <p>By all which, I conceive it plainly appears, that the two Houses sit with the King in Parliament, and concur in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Laws, not as Coordinate Powers, that are equal to him; but as Subordinate under him: not in Place of Sovereigns, but of Subjects under him their sole Sovereign.

               <p>This Plea of Equity, against the Letter of these Laws and Legal Declarations, is for excepting some particular Cases, from being meant and comprehended in the general Terms used therein: and that is by way of Presumption, that the Makers of those Laws and Declarations would have except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, had the Cases been foreseen, or particularly put to them. But there is no Place for presumptions of a thing, against express Declarations to the contrary; or for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing such exceptions in Laws, that say themselves they do not except any Cases.

In mere Positives, or in things of mere Human Obligation, it may have more Place. But in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of intrinsick Goodness, and Natural Obligation, it has none. They are standing Rules, that admit of no exception, and the Plea of Equity must always, and only be for the keeping, but never for the breaking of them. No Man must ever pretend Equity, for leave to commit Murder, or Adultery, or to Steal, or to Rebel, or to Transgress any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law of Nature. For the main care of Equity, is to


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61813:40"/>
make these Duties inviolable; and so the Argument to be drawn from thence, is in every Case to Act according to them, but in no Case to Act against them.</p>
               <p>The Pretence for Equities exempting some Cases from the Prohibitions of Resistance, is for the <hi>safety of Subjects,</hi> because say <note n="*" place="margin">Id. p. 2.12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> some, <hi>no Man can owe so much Duty to his Prince, as not to have a Salve for his</hi> Safety <hi>especially for his Life.</hi> But what a Man owes, or is oblig'd to by the Law of Nature, not only to his Prince, but to the meanest Fellow-Subject, or to any of Mankind, is without any such Salvo, even for Life, and he may not transgress such Natural Duty towards them, tho it were to save his Life. It not being lawful to Steal, or Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or commit Adultery, or Transgress any other Natural Duties against our Neighbours, no not when we are the most put upon it, and tempted thereto to save our selves.</p>
               <p>I add, whatever People spurr'd on by a desire of Revenge, may vainly fancy in Favor of their own Passions, that Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty sets more by Submission in all Cases, than by this desired Liberty of Resistance. Its first Precept about this Matter is, whatever the Governor be, to have Government kept up; which is by holding on Submission, that is always cast off by Resisting. And this, not only in Regard to Gods Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, whereto it calls for Justice and Submission, tho in an evil Prince but also in Care of the Subjects own Good. Which amidst all the hazards Men may think the Doctrine of Non-Resistance to be attended withal, is much more, and much safer, in this Constancy of Submission and Non-Resistance; than it would be in the contrary Liberty of Resisting and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Arms, on the foresaid Pretences.</p>
               <p>Lastly, that Equity doth not exempt from this Non-Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is plain, because it is a general Principle, and what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption it gives would be General: under all Governments, absolute as well as limited, and in all times and Places, one having as much Claim to Natural Equity, as another has. And so, there would have been Exemption thereby under the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, fancied (tho without Ground) to have been absolute and arbitrary Governors; and in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive


<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61813:41"/>
Scripture Times, as well as under our Kings, and in this present, or the preceding Age. Whereas, our Blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and his Holy Apostles and the Primitive Saints, plainly admit of no exemption under those Emperors.<note n="†" place="margin">Id. p. 15.22.</note> And the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers of this Plea own there was none, nor allow any Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Resisting, under any absolute and arbitrary King.</p>
               <p>They <note n="‖" place="margin">Id. p. 12, 23. <hi>And Inquiry into the Measures of Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority.</hi> Art. 14.</note> appeal likewise, from these <hi>Declarations of our Laws,</hi> to the <hi>Nature of our Constitution,</hi> and the <hi>end of our Frame:</hi> and think, it will justifie that Resistance, which these Sayings and Declarations of Law Condemn.</p>
               <p>But as to our Constitution, thereby the <hi>Supremacy is fixed solely in the King</hi>; and therein is an <hi>express denyal of all Coercive Power over him</hi>; and a Declaration or <hi>Maxim,</hi> that <hi>he can do no Wrong,</hi> what he doth, being by Ministers, and they only, and not he, being accountable in any Court here for the same. All which, leaving neither Fault im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable to him to deserve it, nor Autority in any others to Try and Judge him for the same, must needs bar all <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures</hi> of the Crown.

And in a Government of this Frame, owning <hi>one irresistible</hi> Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, and thus carefully <hi>excluding all taking Arms against him,</hi> I do not see whence any should hope to fetch this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Resisting.</p>
               <p>And as for the end of that part of our Constitution, which lies in <hi>securing our Liberties</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi>; that is plainly with limitation, and <hi>so far only, as they can be secured to Subjects continuing Subjects, i.e.</hi> in Consistence with Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, which is thrown off by Military Resisting. They are to be secured thereby to the Subjects of these Realms, so far as they can be secured, under a Sovereign and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistible Prince, (as our Constitution makes ours to be,) and by Men keeping to their Duty and Obedience.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. Of Passive Obedience under Invaders of Natural Rights. And these as Defensable by Arms, as Civil Rights.</head>
               <p>HAving hitherto shewn, that the Invasion of Civil Rights and Laws, gives no exemption from the Gospel Duties of Obedience and Non-Resistance, which I think I have made pretty plain, both from the Case of <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and from our <hi>own Laws</hi> themselves: I now proceed to shew, in the</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourth</hi> and last place, that if this defensibleness of Legal Rights, would exempt us; a <hi>like Defensibleness of Natural Rights, would as well have exempted all other Subjects of Sovereign Powers.</hi> And so, contrary to what the Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates of Resistance themselves affirm, would have left no such Duty in the World, as <hi>Passive Obedience.</hi> The true Christian, and <hi>Thank worthy Passiveness,</hi> as<note n="†" place="margin">1 Pet. ii.19, 20.</note> S. <hi>Peter</hi> observes, not being that of Malefactors, who <hi>suffer for their real Faults</hi>; but of <hi>Righteous</hi> Persons and <hi>Well-Doers,</hi> who cannot suffer, but by an Invasion of Rights, or unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous usage.</p>
               <p>All Oppressors, <hi>invade Mens Natural Rights</hi>; if they have no <hi>Civil Laws, to make them Civil Rights.</hi> That Ruler, who has no Civil Laws to guide him, is yet bound to guide himself, by the Law of Nature and Reason. Now Nature, makes Right and Wrong, and appoints Laws for them. Else, by the mere Law of Nature, there could be no such thing, as unrighteousness, or wronging of our Brethren. <hi>Thou shalt not Kill,</hi> and <hi>thou shalt not Steal,</hi> are some of Natures Laws. And all <hi>shedding of innocent Blood,</hi> all <hi>Theft, Lies,</hi> and <hi>breach of Faith,</hi> are by Nature violations of Right, and so unrighteous Actions.</p>
               <p>Now, Natural Rights, are as Defensible this way, as any Civil Rights are. I do not only say, they are as


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61813:42"/>
Sacred, and Inviolable: yea, having God, and not man for their Author; and a Divine Law, not an Human, for their Guard, they must needs be more inviolabe. But also, that they are as Defensible by Force, as any Civil Rights. Thus, Princes, and Sovereign States, take Arms against each other, to defend their Natural Rights. And so may Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Persons, (under like moderation of <hi>Christian Charity,</hi> as they are to shew in quarrelling for any other Rights,) when assaulted by Thieves, Murderers, or other unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Attempters, and have no leisure, or opportunity, to call in the Protection of Government, and Guard of Civil Laws: one private Person, having Liberty to fight another in these Cases, in defence of their Lives, Persons, Liberty, and other things, which are Natural Rights. And this is the <hi>Liberty of Self-Defence</hi>: which is a Liberty of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending these Natural, (or other) Rights, by our own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Force; when, being out of the Cover of Laws, we are left, as in a State of Nature, to defend our selves.</p>
               <p>Indeed, mere Natural Rights, have no Civil Defence, till they are taken in to be Civil Rights. That is, there is no Commencing an Action, and suing for them in any Civil Courts, till they are backed and defended by Civil Laws. But this way of Defending by force of Arms, is a Natural Defence, in which Laws give a Man no help at all, but he is left purely to the strength of his own Natural Powers. And for Natural Rights, a Man may make his Natural De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, which is no more than the liberty of Self-Defence.</p>
               <p>Nay, when Men come to defend their Civil and Legal Rights this way, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>running to Arms,</hi> they defend them not as Civil Rights. For what Defence any thing gets, by having a Civil Law for it, and being a Civil Right, is a <hi>Legal Defence,</hi> or <hi>Defence by Legal Process.</hi> It may be pleaded in a Law Court; and whilst Courts have Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority, and Law can be heard in them, that will defend it. But when Men leave contesting these Rights at Law, and fall to Arms, they absolutely throw off this Civil De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; there being no Cover or Defence from Law, among


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61813:42"/>
drawn Swords, nor any use in War, of Witness, Judge, and Juries. And, instead of that, they come back to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Defence, or by their own Natural strength, which is to defend them as Natural Rights. So that Natural Rights, must needs be as defensible by Arms, I conceive, as Civil Rights: since Civil Rights, as Civil, are not at all defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible by Arms, but by Law Suits; and to defend them this way, Men must bring them out of the State of Civil, which lies in being under Government and in Courts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the State of Natural Rights. And when, in any Case, the Law justifies this Defence afterwards, it is not as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Civil Law, but under the Notion of a Natural Right, or as being the Natural Liberty of Self-Defence.</p>
               <p>But now, if Subjects might have recourse to this forcible Defence, and Levy War against their Sovereigns, upon their violation of Natural Laws, and Invasion of Natural Rights, which are as defensible this way, as any Civil Rights: then there is no such thing as <hi>Passive Obedience,</hi> nor ever was any Submission and Non-Resistance due, to ill and injust Kings. And so in reality, there should have been none due, in those times, when God always required it, both among <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Christians:</hi> whose Passive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was never tried, but when they suffered unrighteously, by an Invasion of their Natural and Divine however, if not also of their Civil and Human Rights. So that this Plea, of the <hi>Defensibleness of these Rights by Force,</hi> will afford no ease peculiar to us, nor alter the Case of Non-Resistance with us, from what has been so long since determined of it, in the Scriptures, and the Primitive Church. Had it been true, it would have set the suffering Subjects loose in those days. And, as the Inspired Men, and Holy Fathers, taught Non-Resistance, as a Truth then: they would, were they now alive, tell us it is as true now, and bid us do the same in ours.</p>
               <p>This forcible defence of Civil Rights then, as well as a like forcible defence of Natural Rights, must be limited to Private Persons. If Men were under no Civil Governors,


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61813:43"/>
they would be left each to defend their own Rights. And when they are under Government, they are still left to it against other Private Persons, in Cases that will not stay for the defence of Laws, or for recourse to Governors. But there is no liberty for Subjects, to defend their Rights thus by joyning in Arms, against their lawful Sovereigns. The Holy Scriptures, and our own Laws, as I have shown, plainly forbidding this way of Defence, when Subjects suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Invasion of Rights. And the Pleaders for Resistance, allowing they may not take it in defence of Natural and Divine Rights, no not in defence of Religion it self, till it is taken in to stand by Civil Law; and Civil Rights, are not more defensible by force of Arms, than Natural and Divine Rights are.</p>
               <p>To the Sovereign Power, the Command of God is, <hi>to be Subject.</hi> Then there is no Resisting, since warlike Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance throws off Subjection. So, Levying War in Subjects, can be no way of defending Rights against their Sovereign. Nor can they take any ways of Defence, but what are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with Subjection. Therefore their Defence of Rights, must only be in those ways, which keep in the Order of Government and Justice. If they are oppressed by a lower Power, they may seek to a higher, and so rise, till in this way they have tried the Sovereign himself, beyond whom, in Subordination of Government, there can be no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, but to God himself. So there is Human help this way, against all Governors, but the Supreme. Yea, some Kings themselves, are but imperfect Sovereigns. They have reserved Cases: and though they are Supreme, in all others; yet in these they have Superiors, to take Cognizance of, and declare their Failures, and discharge their Subjects from bearing them any more Allegiance. And here is Human Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress, and that by force, even against the King: not by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and casting off the Order of Government; but by keeping under, and paying subjection to those, whom, in these Cases, the Laws have made Superior unto him. This may seem the Case of <hi>Poland,</hi> where a Clause said to be in the <hi>Coronation Oath,</hi> sounds to this purpose.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:61813:43"/>But, where a King is the <hi>Sole Supreme,</hi> both <hi>over all Persons</hi> and <hi>in all Causes</hi> that can come under Judicial Cognizance: he can only have God above him. And when he Invades the Rights, and stands in it; after we have sought to Courts, and made Supplications, and used all ways for a Subjects Redress: there is no way, but to be content with so much Right, as we can have by continuing under his Government; and for the rest, to leave it to God, (who will be sure to do it first or last,) either to redress, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge our Cause. But the way of Subjects, by order of God, who requires them for all this to continue subject, cannot be to resume the liberties of ungoverned Persons, and fall every one to right themselves against him by force of Arms; which is to throw off the state of Subjects, and set up to be their own Governors. Nay, this way of defending Rights, would be the most unwise, and opposite to that securing of Rights they aim at, as well as most of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive to Almighty God. For however, in their heat, and uneasiness under Wrongs, Men are apt to think this a way of recovering, and defending such Invaded Rights: in the end they will find, it is the way to leave, both them and all their other Rights, defenceless, and under no Guard, or Security at all. For Government, is the best safe Guard, of our Liberties and Properties. And if once we go to pull it down, we go at the same time, when we do not think it, to pull down our selves, and to set open our own Freedoms. The Fence being broken down, the Inclosure becomes common, and our Rights lie open to all Intruders.</p>
               <p>From this Discourse I shall observe, that as to the Point of <hi>using Forcible Defence,</hi> it seems no great difference, <hi>when Religion is Persecuted,</hi> whether <hi>it stand upon its own Right, or be taken into the Law of the Land, and stand on Civil Right.</hi> Every Man has a Right, to be truly Religious, and to serve God. He has a Right, to seek Eternal Happiness; and to Truth in Religion, as the way to it. And every Prince Invades this Right; yea, I add, and God's too, who


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61813:44"/>
denies him this, and Persecutes him for it. If God has a Right to our Service, we must needs have a Right, nay, be under Duty and Obligation, which I think is more than a Right, to serve him. And this Right, is unalienable; no Prince, or Power on Earth, who are all Authorized to Rule us under God, not to Rule over him, can, or ought to set it aside, or deprive us thereof.</p>
               <p>And as no Prince can, so can no Law do it. For whence must that Law have such Authority? Is it from God? No sure, he cannot Authorize any Human Laws, to set aside his own Laws, for that were to give Men Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority over himself. It is only the Power of the Law Maker, that gives the Law its Power. And if the Human Power that made the Law, cannot take away this Right; the Stream cannot rise higher than the Spring, nor the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect have what the Cause had not, so that the Law made by him cannot do it. If a Law attempts to take away this Right, it is as bad, as if a Prince doth it. As he is an unrighteous Prince, so is it an unrighteous Law; and we do not cease to have this Right for either, but suffer equally an Invasion of an unalienable Right in both.</p>
               <p>Now, since Religion, however Persecuted, whether with or without Law, is an unalienable Right: how should its having, or wanting a Civil Law, either give or take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way this forceable Defence of it. For its own Natural and Divine Right, is as defensable by Natural Force, as I have shown, as any Civil Right the Law will add to it.</p>
               <p>And what is it, that a Civil Law doth, towards this way of its Defence? It maks it, say <note n="†" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Johnson's Remarks on Doctor</hi> Sherlock'<hi>s Case of Resistance</hi> &amp;c. p. 19, 20.</note> they, <hi>a Civil Right and Property: And a Persecuting Law against it, though, as it is wicked, it cannot command our Obedience; yet, as it is a Law, it may dispose of our Civil Rights.</hi> True, a Civil Law, will make or unmake a Civil Right, which gives or takes away a Civil Defence, by Courts and Law Suits. When it has a Civil Right, it will have Redress in Courts, and have Men punished for invading of Civil Liberties. And when it has lost this, by a Law against it; its Professors must


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61813:44"/>
not come to Sue for in Court, or hope to find any help there.</p>
               <p>But what is this <hi>Defence of Courts,</hi> by being a Civil Right, to <hi>Natural Defence,</hi> or <hi>defending it by Force of Arms?</hi> Were the Doctrine of Resistance true, as I have shewn, it need not go to <hi>Civil Right,</hi> to have this Natural De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: or, if it did, Civil Right would send it back again to Natural Right; Civil Rights, when they come to this way of Defence, throwing aside what they have by being Civil, and coming into the State of Natural Rights. So that whilst it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a Natural, or Divine Right, it is Defensible by Arms, as if it were a Civil Right. And such a Right, true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion always is, and however Persecuted, whether with Law, or without, or against it. It holds this Right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alienably under the unrighteous Invasion of Laws, as much as under the illegal Invasion of Rulers. And having the Right as fully, if it were Defensible this way, it might Defend it as lawfully against their Invasions, as against his. And then the Professors of True, but Persecuted Religion, might fight for it against their Persecuting Sovereigns, not only for the Laws, but for the Truths sake; and be as Free to make this Defence for it, when it is driven out by the Law of the Land, as when it has that Law on its side. Which, besides what is said thereto above, I note against those, who make an armed Defence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion among us, different from a like Defence in the days of the Apostles and Primitive Persecutions: on account, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion than had the Laws against it; but now, through the blessing of God, it has the Laws on its side.</p>
               <p>What has been offered upon this last Point, is sufficient also, over and above what has been said to that before, against those, who make our case different, from that of the Primitive Saints, either <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Christians: because the Non-Resistance they paid, was not,</hi> say they, <hi>to limited Rulers,</hi> as our Kings are, being bound up by Laws; <hi>but to Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Governors.</hi> For, though some are more <hi>Absolute,</hi> i.e. more left to Discretion, and have fewer Human Laws to direct them, than others: yet, were no Governors ever perfectly so. There were, both Laws, and Popular Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms

and Immunities, under the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, as I have shew'd. And <hi>Laws not to be alter'd,</hi> under the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians.</hi> And a body of Laws, (which <hi>God</hi>

               <p>Besides, all the Power of People, and the Liberty of resuming their primitive natural Rights, and standing up to right themselves when wrong'd by their Governors: is grounded, by the Advocates for Resistance, on the <hi>Original Contract,</hi> whereby, in the first Framing and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of every Government, when the People, as they say, parted each with their native Liberty, and set Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors over them, they every where made these Reserves for themselves. This <hi>Original Contract,</hi> is the last Ground, when things are run up to the top, of all Peoples rising in Arms against unjust Powers; thus reassuming the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority they had formerly intrusted, when they see it mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>employed, and deposing those Kings who had abused their Trust.</p>
               <p>Now this <hi>Original Contract,</hi> particularly as to our own Nation, will not be pretended, I believe, to be any where extant upon <hi>publick Record.</hi> And the rather, for that in <hi>Magna Charta</hi> it self, the <hi>grand Record of our Liberties</hi>; those Liberties are not fetch'd from the <hi>Peoples own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,</hi> as if originally we came by them that way: but

                  <hi>to have and to hold, to them and their Heirs, of us, and our Heirs for ever,</hi> says the <hi>Charter.</hi> And much less, I think are we to expect any Records of such Reserves, under the <hi>first</hi> and most <hi>ancient Governments.</hi> For under them, the People were so far from making, or recording, any such fancied Reserves of Rights and Privileges: that they had not any Record of Laws but what were in their Princes Breasts, not so much as stipulating for any Rules whereby they would be govern'd, but trusting and submitting themselves, to the Justice and Discretion of their Rulers, as I have noted of the <hi>first</hi> Kings.</p>
               <p>But this Contract, is fetch'd from the common Reason and Nature of things: there being no other way possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as these Men say, whereby <hi>Civil Government should take Rise.</hi> Now the Nature of things, is one and the same, to <hi>all Times</hi> and <hi>Places.</hi> And common Reason, must be as common to <hi>East</hi> as <hi>West</hi>: to the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> under those more <hi>absolute Powers</hi>; as to the <hi>Goths,</hi> or <hi>Germans,</hi> or other <hi>Northern Nations,</hi> who have provided better for <hi>popular Liberties.</hi> And therefore, if common Reason and the Nature of things, will carry such an <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Contract,</hi> the ground of Resistance, for us; it would have done as much for them. And if it was not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, to authorize Resistance in their Case, as these men themselves affirm, asserting them to have been under a tye of Conscience to Passive Obedience: it cannot suffice any more to do it in ours. Common Reason, and Nature of Government, gives equal provision to all, and as much Original Contract to the Subjects of absolute Emperors, as to those of legal Monarchs: who, whatever Liberties and Provisions they have more, have them not from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Reason, but the special limitations of their own Laws. So that on this account, we must not take more liberty to our selves, or make our Case, in point of Resistance, different from theirs.</p>

               </p>
               <p>No, say I, under those illegal Actings, they are still Kings and Sovereigns. Tho there be no Authority deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the Action, which, if it be against the Laws of God and the Land, is condemn'd and vacated, not autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized and enforced by either of them: yet the Authority abides still in the Person. And as to the dueness of Non-resistance in such illegal Actings, the Question is not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the illegal Act has any Authority; but whether the Sovereign that acts so, retains his Authority. For Passive Obedience, is due to the Person in Authority: and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever liberty we might otherwise take, to oppose such an Action; we must keep passive, under such a Person. If, for all his illegal Act, he is still thy <hi>Father</hi>; the <hi>fifth</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment says, <hi>Honor</hi> and <hi>obey him.</hi> If he retains his Authority over us, and continues to be the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Higher Power</hi>; S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that <hi>in Conscience</hi> towards God, <hi>we must needs be subject to him.</hi> And whilst we are to be subject, we must not resist: for when once we fall to warlike Resisting, there is an end of Subjection. So that it is not enough to say, the Illegality doth disautho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize the Action, or hinder it from being binding; unless it also disauthorize the Person, and make a Forfeiture of his Authority over us. For whilst his Authority lasts, we are bound to continue his Subjects; and that tyes us to be passive in such Cases.</p>
               <p>Now, a King may keep his Autority, for all he doth some inautoritative, and illegal Actions. He doth not lose Power, by abusing his Power, or stretching to make it more: nor make away that real Autority which he has, by going beyond it in an unautoritative Act, or pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to some Authority which he has not.</p>
               <p>What Autority have any Sovereign Powers, to make Laws against the true Religion? If their Autority is from God, I am sure he has given them no Commission, to forbid what he has commanded. They go quite against the Rule of Legislation, when they employ it in making Laws against him. And those Laws, carry no binding Force from God along with them, to oblige Subjects to their Observance. So that if by inautoritative Acts, be meant <hi>Acts against the Rule of Administration</hi>; or <hi>without any real Right, to warrant the King himself in command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to oblige others to obey them:</hi> all Laws are inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritative Acts, which are made against the true Religion. But yet, they that urge this Objection, will not say, that any Kings forfeit their Crowns, or ease their Subjects of the Duty of Passive Obedience, by making persecuting Laws. Nay, <note n="†" place="margin">

                  </note> they say there is a necessity of not resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, but being passive under them, because they have such Laws whereby to persecute them.</p>
               <p>What is the real and intrinsick Authority, or Legality, of a Sentence grosly unjust, and apparently contrary to Law? I mean not only contrary to <hi>Legal Forms,</hi> as a


<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61813:47"/>
                  <hi>Judgment</hi> would be without a <hi>Jury:</hi> but contrary to those particular Laws in any Case, which the Judge, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Form, ought to pronounce by. A Man comes to a Judge and Jury, to have Law, or the benefit of those particular Laws, which he grounds his Claim upon. And the Judge, is to pass Sentence according to these Laws, and to give what the Laws give him. And, I suppose, those Laws do not authorize this Sentence, if it grosly and corruptly perverts, what they say. In this Case, if they authorize what the Judge says, I think they must no longer authorize what they say themselves, since his Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is directly contrary to theirs. And accordingly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of authorizing, they will reverse it, so soon as they fall into the hands of a more upright Judge and Jury, that will find and pronounce aright. So that here is a Sentence against the Laws, that should have ruled it: which, not having the Laws concern'd therein, to auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize and bear it out, if Autority must come from Law, I think will be an inautoritative Act. But I imagine these Objectors do not believe, he ceases thereupon immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to be a Judge, which would vacate all the Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he passes afterwards. Or, that the aggrieved Parties have Remedy any other way, than by legal Appeals. Wherein, if they can find no Redress at last from the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power it self, yet are they not thereby set loose from being any longer his Subjects, nor have any Discharge, as I think is confess'd on all hands, from their Passive Obedience.</p>
               <p>How many illegal, and unautoritative Acts, were done by <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Ahab, Ahaz,</hi> and <hi>Manasse,</hi> and other ill Kings among the <hi>Jews</hi>; which yet did not unking them? And by the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, as I have shown, which yet did not disrobe them of their Purple, or free the poor oppressed Christians, and other Subjects of the Empire, from being subject to, and passive under them? Among these, are instances enow, as may appear from what is said above, of illegal Acts, against the Autority of all Laws,


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61813:47"/>
both of God, and of their own Realms. And yet of the Sovereigns, who were the illegal Actors, still retaining their Sovereign Autority, and holding the Sufferers in their former state of Subjects, and under an obligation of Conscience to Passive Obedience. And this is a clear proof, that God, tho he has given Rules to higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which are Duties of Governors, and according to which, at the great Day, he will judge them himself: Yet, has not made these Rules of exercising Power, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of their holding Power, or Grounds of Forfeiture. He himself, under the most enormous Breaches of these Rules, having plainly declared, by the inspired Pen-men, of those Princes that broke them, that they were still in Autority, and that their Subjects, as they would answer the contrary to him, were to keep in their Obedience and Duty to them notwithstanding. So that wheresoever any Forfeiture of Crowns comes in, it must be, by some special provisions in a Peoples own Laws. And where Law makes a Forfeiture, it will make a Prince forfeit in a legal way, by appointing some superior Power to try the Fact, and judicially to declare the Forfeiture. But I do not conceive, how there can be any legal way of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting, where the Prince is declared by Law, to be the <hi>Sole Supreme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, if unautoritative Acts do not disautorize the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and make him sink into a private Man; but for all them, a King continues still to be a King: where is the Argument for Resistance from such inautoritative Acts? Yes, <note n="‖" place="margin">
                     <hi>Thoughts of a Priv.

But Resistance, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Defence, tho it be for an Action, must be of some Person. And what if there is something, to bar such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, in the Person? As I think the Law appoints in the Persons of <hi>Father and Mother,</hi> when it declares, <hi>he shall


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61813:48"/>
surely be put to death, that smiteth them.</hi> Exod. xxi.15. And in the <hi>Persons of Higher Powers,</hi> when it calls us to <hi>honor,</hi> to <hi>keep subject,</hi> and <hi>not to resist them.</hi> So there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his person, to keep out all Resistance, and arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against our Sovereign. The Argument for not resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, or making a warlike Defence against him, is because he is King. And then, what takes off this, and can be an Argument for Resistance, must be something that doth unking him. And since such unautoritative Acts, are no Forfeitures of Crowns; 'tis plain, whatever other Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities they are a ground of, they are no ground of levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing War, or armed Resistance.</p>
               <p>This, I take to be a very good, and sufficient Ground, and I think it is the true Ground, of Submission and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Obedience, under illegal Violence and Persecutions. The illegal Act, I conceive, has nothing in it self to bar Self-defence; having no Autority to bear out and inforce it, as may seem, either from God or Man. Not from God; for if his Law carries his Autority, (and where doth he display his Autority, if not in his Laws?) what is against his Law, is against his Autority. Nor from Man, for the same Reason, of its being against humane Laws, which carry their Autority. But the Autority of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, is a Bar to this way of Defence against our Sovereign. And when the Sovereign will do such illegal Acts, tho he has no Autority to justifie himself therein, nor to make his unrighteous or illegal Commands, really obligatory and binding: yet, because he is a Person, under whose Autority and Obedience we all are, this will be the effect of them. Seeing Subjects under Government, can have no Remedy, but what keeps the order of Government, and must be content with so much, as keeping to that Order allows: till God alter his mind, we can have no present Redress. And being his Subjects, we cannot go to arm against him, to defend or right our selves. And this is <hi>Passive Obedience.</hi> So that when the irreligion or illegality of the Command, exempts us from any Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61813:48"/>
to active Performance: this Autority of his Person, doth notwithstanding lay on us an Obligation, of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under his Obedience, and making no warlike Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
               <p>And on these Grounds it will be easie to give a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and plain Answer to those Questions, which the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputers for Resistance shall think most posing, about the Authority of Kings, when they act against Laws.</p>
               <p>If it be asked, What is a Kings Autority, when he doth such illegal Acts? 'Tis just the same it was before he did them; for as he doth not get, so he doth not lose any rightful, and real Autority thereby.</p>
               <p>But what doth his Autority give, to the illegal Act, or Order? Doth it authorize the Subjects in an illegal thing? or make the Law, which forbids it, cease to be a Rule to them? No, the Laws of God and Men, are to be the Rules of conscionable acting. The Autority of the Law, is the Autority of a Rule. And for a Rule, it is the best Autority. And an humane Law, is the best Humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority. And where Kings, neither make, nor unmake and repeal Laws, alone; the King commanding in the Laws, is of more Autority to rule the Subjects Actings, than the King commanding against them.</p>
               <p>And what doth his Autority give him, as to that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular illegal Act? Not to be questionable, or account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for it among Men, or coercible by Force and armed Opposition. And that, because for all that act, he is still our King, and we owe him Subjection. Receiving such il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal Acts from our King, we must receive them as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. And the obligation of continuing Subjects, excludes all Liberty of armed Resistance.</p>
               <p>Whence, say they, in an illegal Act, has a Sovereign Prince this Autority? From the <hi>Fifth</hi> Commandment, and from all those Commandments, that require Submission, and Obedience, and being subject unto Princes. For the plain intent of all those Precepts, as may sufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, I think, from what I have said on this Argument;

is to require these, to Princes that break, as well as to those that keep Laws; to unjust, as well as to righteous Sovereigns. And if God commands us to submit, and keep in Subjection to a Sovereign Prince, that acts against Laws; he must forbid us to resist such: for men put off Subjection, when they fall to Resisting.</p>
               <p>It may be asked still, has he it from the Law of the Land? Yes. What, from the Law he invades? Doth the Law give him Autority to break it self? No, but by all those Laws, that declare he incurs no Forfeiture by such Invasions. For all those Laws, that own and declare such Invader to be still our King, determine our Subjection to him, and forbid us to resist him. For Men are no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the state and posture of Subjects, when they come to arm against their Sovereigns.</p>
               <p>If a Man suffers illegally, they will demand by what Law? By none surely, for then there is an end of the Illegality. But to ask for a Law for his suffering, is to ask for something to justifie, or make it just in the eye of Law, that he should suffer. But this is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended from the Kings Autority; and it is supposed to be an unjust, and illegal Suffering. But if the King has no Autority, to justifie the illegal Suffering; has he any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority, to bar the illegal Sufferers resisting? Yes, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Autority not being lost by that illegal Act, but still abiding in him. For all he makes a Man suffer against Law, he is still his King. And that is a Reason against Resisting. For by all Law, both of God and Man, we must be subject to our King. And he ceases to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that draws his Sword against him.</p>

               <p>Whatever the rightful Sovereign be then, that bears hard upon any Man; let me ask him who is most uneasie, if, for all his Personal unworthiness, and oppressive Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he be not still <hi>the Lords anointed,</hi> and <hi>the Ordinance of God.</hi> And so long, if he will be a Follower of the Holy Scriptures, the Primitive Fathers, or our own Church, whose Testimonies have been alledged, how can he lift up his hand against him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A second Ground of their Non-Resistance, was in <hi>Patience and Submission to Gods Providence.</hi> In such hard Cases, they were like to ease their Suffering by Patience, and make it worse by Resistance. <hi>In your Patience,</hi> says our Saviour, <hi>possess ye your Souls. Luke</hi> xxi.19. When the Cross was brought upon them, they were called to take it up, not to drive it away; to <hi>follow Christ</hi> in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it themselves, not to follow the World in endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Force it upon others: according to those Precepts of our Lord, for <hi>taking up,</hi> and <hi>bearing his Cross.</hi> These Persecutions they looked on, as sent by God for tryal of their Patience, not of their fighting Valor in making Resistance: and were careful under them, to shew invincible Stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in Sufferings; not refuse to Suffer, and rather fight in their own Defence. <hi>The Cup, which my Father hath given me, shall I not Drink it?</hi> Therefore <hi>put up thy Sword,</hi> said <hi>Christ.</hi> Joh. xviii.11. <hi>Lo here is the Patience of the Saints,</hi> says S. <hi>John,</hi> noting what in their Persecutions they sought to Signalize. <hi>Rev.</hi> xiv.12.

                  <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all your injuries, the Judgment and Vengeance of God is our Defence. And upon that account it is, that none of us makes any Resistance, though we have Numbers more than enough,</hi> says S <hi>Cyprian.</hi> And <hi>loe, here is the Faith, and Patience of the Saints,</hi> said S. <hi>John. Rev.</hi> xiii.10. They committed their Rights to him, when despoiled of them by unjust Force, and never went about to make Parties and Tumults, by Force to Right themselves; to shew the Faith they had in his <hi>Justice,</hi> his <hi>Providence,</hi> and <hi>Promises</hi>; and how far, and freely, even in these dearest and most concerning Interests, they durst trust him.</p>
               <p>Now both these also, are Reasons equally not to Resist, under any rightful Sovereigns. The Cross is the same, under one, as under others. The same Tryal of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and of Faith, when they fall under the same distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: whether by Christian or Heathen, Sober or Dissolute, by Princes that Invade, or that observe Civil Laws and Legal Properties.</p>
               <p>Now, to all this, that has been said on this Subject, it would be a very weak and unjust exception, to say, <hi>this forbidding of Resistance on violation of Laws, is setting up for illegal and arbitrary Government.</hi> For to <hi>Govern Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily,</hi> is to <hi>Rule by Discretion,</hi> or to have no written Laws to Govern by. And where there are Stated Laws, to regulate and direct Administrations; there is all the Human care that can be, to prevent Arbitrariness in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:61813:54"/>There are but two ways, to limit and lay Restraints, or keep any Governor within compass. One is, <hi>Laws</hi>; which restrain him as a <hi>Rule,</hi> by fixing and prescribing for him, his just Bounds. The other, is a <hi>Superior Power,</hi> that can call him to account when he Deviates, and forceably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel him to return into a Right Course; and these restrain him as his <hi>Rulers.</hi> Now, as for this later way, of appointing Higher Powers, for their Supervisors and Correctors: it is visible this can be no way of restraining Sovereigns; who can be no longer Sovereigns, but Subjects, if they have any Superiors, He that is by Law declared the <hi>Supreme,</hi> especiall <hi>the only Supreme</hi> in any Realm, must needs be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, and no Man can be above him. Though the Laws of his Realm, are to be his Rule; yet no Man in his Realm can be his Ruler, nor they, who all profess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves made subject to, pretend to set upon him.</p>
               <p>Besides, if such Correctors were appointed, to secure the Laws: yet would that be only a Dream of Security, which would vanish, as Experience made us awake and come to our selves, and not secure them really, more than they are secured already. For these Correctors, being sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to like Over-sights, Passions, and Misgovernments, are as liable to Prevaricate and Violate the Laws, as those whom they are set to Supervise. The Laws are safe enough, in the Hands of good Kings; and as unsafe, in the Hands of ill Correctors, as of ill Kings; and such Correctors, are every whit as liable, and like as oft to be ill, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse the Laws, as Kings themselves. And what redress for the Invasions and breach of Laws, when they do amiss? So that this doth not Cure, but only shift the Disease, which is uncureable under any Sovereign or last Judge, be it King or Parliament. Army or Mobile, through the Nature of this World, and the inseparable uncertainties of Human Affairs.</p>

                  </gap>ne of Human Subordinations then, some must be Sovereigns; and these must be Men, subject to be drawn aside like our selves: so can these have no Restraint,

but Laws; nor any Judge but God, and so be unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able here on Earth. The only possible restraint of Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariness in them, is Laws. And the best restraint these can lay, is, if Acts of State and Justice, are to be sped, not only by the Sovereign himself in Person, but by his <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</hi> And if, though the Sovereign himself is not, yet his Ministers are accountable, and tryable for Breach of Laws, as well as others. Which, I think, is as much se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity under a Sovereign, as Sovereignty allows. And this Human Security, we have in this Realm, to Guard our Laws: although we may not resist our Sovereign, and fight for those Laws against him by force of Arms; which is a throwing off his Sovereignty over us, and setting up for our Selves.</p>
               <p>But though this Doctrine of Non-Resistance, yea, even <hi>in Defence of Laws,</hi> doth not make <hi>Arbitrary Power:</hi> yet, on the other Hand I would have it considered, whether the <hi>Liberty of Resistance,</hi> is not like to bring in <hi>Arbitrary Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</hi> They may <hi>cast off Obedience,</hi> say some, <hi>for Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good, i.e.</hi> when they see it Expedient, for they must judge of it. Is not this to set Subjects loose, when they see Cause. And if they are <hi>Arbitrary Governors,</hi> who in Ruling are left to Discretion: are not they also, as Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Subjects, who in Obeying are left to Discretion? Now, to Cure Arbitrary Power, by Arbitrary Obedience; is to Cure Tyrannical Government, by no Government, which is as bad, nay, abundantly worse. The very worst of Tyrants, are <hi>the Ministers of God for good,</hi> in comparison of no Government. One Tyrant's Lust, cannot Rifle all Virgins; nor his Avarice, devour all Estates; nor his Revenge, reach all Persons; nor his Cruelty, cut off the Common Wealth. But under no Government, the Rabble will Govern all. And that will be branched out into many thousand Tyrants, who Persecute without Pity, as well as Justice; and pull down and spoil, without any Relentings; and have no Generosity to spare, or greatness of Soul to neglect or leave any thing; but think the meanest Plunder


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61813:55"/>
a desireable Prey, and sweep all before them. <hi>A Poor Man, that oppresseth the Poor, is like a sweeping Rain,</hi> says <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. Prov.</hi> xxviii.3. And I think the Experience we have had of late, in these three Realms, of the Rabbles Ruling is enough to convince all Considerate Men, that a few months of their Expedition, is much more full of illegal Violence, Injustice, and Inhumanity, and a great deal more formidable, than a Tyrants whole Reign.</p>
