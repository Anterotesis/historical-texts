            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p n="4">4. All Gods decrees are infinitely <hi>wiſe, holy, juſt;</hi> tending to his <hi>glorie:</hi> and have no externall cauſe, but are ſquared according to the rule of his <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>juſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe poſitions are evident and granted (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) by all ſides. Hence theſe generall inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (as alſo diverſe others) may be concluded.</p>
               <p n="1">I.

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Particular poſitions about Gods dealing with man, to bring him to ſalvation. Concluſions thence.</head>
               <p>IN the next place we deſcend more particularly to theſe poſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>God</hi> from all eternitie decreed to make the <hi>world,</hi> and all things therein <hi>exceeding good,</hi> and <hi>man</hi> after his owne image.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God ſeeing <hi>man falne</hi> from this <hi>happie eſtate</hi> to have brought on himſelfe death, and vanity on the creatures, from eternitie decreed, that the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon in Trinitie</hi> ſhould aſſume humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and being <hi>God, and man</hi> alſo without ſinne, ſhould ſhed his <hi>pretious blood, and offer</hi> up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by death a <hi>ſacrifice of infinite merit,</hi> and <hi>in it ſelfe ſufficient</hi> for all mankinde.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

by their preaching the word.<note place="margin">CHAP. 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. God decreed to give man certaine religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rites; as of old, <hi>types, ſacrifices</hi> of diverſe kinds, <hi>circumciſion,</hi> the <hi>paſſeover;</hi> and ſince Chriſts time <hi>Baptiſme</hi> &amp; the <hi>Lords ſupper;</hi> as to <hi>inſtruct man,</hi> ſo on Gods part to <hi>ſeal</hi> the covenant made to them, who rightly uſe the ſame: that he is their <hi>God in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 1.20. Hoſ. 5.15.</note>5. God decreed <hi>by the viſible things of the world,</hi> by ſeverall <hi>puniſhments,</hi> and <hi>judgements, perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, captivities, warres, famine, &amp;c.</hi> and by <hi>mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>

                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which the <hi>ſpirit of God wrought by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of his ſervants</hi> for the converſion of man,) to humble and inſtruct man.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 6.3. Acts 7.51. Eſay 63.10. Nehe. 9.30.</note>6. God decreed by his <hi>Spirit to ſtrive with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</hi> for the bringing them to repentance, and faith, both of old and in theſe later times; but <hi>not alwaies to ſtrive with them:</hi> And therefore in his unſearchable <hi>mercy and juſtice,</hi> hath fixed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>limits</hi> for the ſame; which are knowne on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his divine wiſedome: unleſſe ſometimes he reveale them, as <hi>in the hundred and twentie yeares</hi> ſet for the old <hi>world.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 6.</note> So there was a fixed time in Gods decree,<note place="margin">Luk. 19.42.44.</note> a <hi>day of the Iewes,</hi> untill which God by his <hi>Spirit</hi> working together with the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his prophets, ſent early and late, and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the preaching of his <hi>Son</hi> ſued to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to turn unto him. In which <hi>day of viſitation,</hi> ſeeing <hi>they knew not the things which belonged to their peace, and would not</hi> be gathered to God; <hi>God</hi> ſtrove no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with them: but left the generalitie of that nation to themſelves.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:4125:7"/>7. God alſo from eternitie, ſeeing the falling away of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> of old, and of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> in theſe later daies, from the true Church (to whom belonged the promiſes in Chriſt, and the priviledges of the fame) decreed to <hi>leave a way open to the Gentiles,</hi> then, for their comming into the true faith and worſhip of <hi>God:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 12.38. &amp; 48.</note> and now <hi>ſets open the gates of the ſpirituall Ieruſalem on each ſide of the Cittie,</hi> for all nations to come in.<note place="margin">Reve. 21.25.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe decrees (diſtinctly laid downe for our better underſtanding) in <hi>God,</hi> are not one former or later then another; but all at once upon his <hi>ſight of all things,</hi> from all eternitie, by his infinite <hi>wiſedome, goodneſſe, and juſtice,</hi> moſt holily decreed the <hi>word of God</hi> telling us, that theſe things in time have beene, are, or ſhall be done and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med on <hi>Gods part.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now from theſe poſitions it may be inferred,</p>
               <p n="1">I. That <hi>God</hi> by making <hi>man</hi> at firſt in an <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie eſtate;</hi> and when man was falne, by <hi>providing a Saviour in himſelfe ſufficient</hi> for all, by taking a <hi>courſe on his owne part</hi> for the ſalvation of all (ſo farre as in <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>Iuſtice</hi> he pleaſed) by <hi>ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he wils not the deſtruction of the wicked;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 33.11.</note> and <hi>by lamenting at</hi> it, ſhewes us evidently, that ſo far he wils the ſalvation of all men.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>God</hi> did not decree to paſſe by, nor to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the greateſt part of mankinde in <hi>Adams</hi> fall, as not bound to them (as indeed he was not to any,) but on his part decreed to take a courſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Adams</hi> fall (ſo far as in <hi>mercie</hi> and <hi>juſtice</hi> he would) for the recovery of all: And when the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4125:8"/>
                  <hi>fixed time</hi> of his ſtriving with them was expired, <hi>then only</hi> (in the execution of his decree) he left them to themſelves: as <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>his houſe:</hi> the <hi>Iewes Apoſtate,</hi> and their <hi>ſeed continuing in apoſtacy:</hi> and ſo of others in like ſort.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>God</hi> hath taken a courſe on his part to keep <hi>man from ſinne,</hi> and is <hi>not the author of mans ſinne;</hi> having made man at the firſt in ſuch an holy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, as that he had <hi>free will to good:</hi> and (when that <hi>free will</hi> was loſt) taking a courſe on his part to have man guided by his <hi>word and ſpirit,</hi> a meanes in it <hi>ſelfe ſufficient</hi> to keep man from ſins dominion: for he hath promiſed to be with his ordinance, and on <hi>his part</hi> will not faile.</p>
               <p n="4">IIII. It is of <hi>Gods infinite mercy,</hi> that the fathers, and Iewes of old, that any nation now, have <hi>Gods word</hi> for their guide and inſtruction, in any kind whatſoever for their ſalvation: (&amp; not any thing in themſelves is a cauſe thereof.)</p>
               <p n="5">V.

               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Gods al-ſeeing eyes</hi> beholding from al eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, what courſes he on <hi>his part</hi> would take, and how among his people the <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> ſhould faithfully doe, what he ordered and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the ſalvation of their people; ſeeing even them alſo who are not in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not <hi>by his or the Rulers or teachers default,</hi> but by <hi>their owne</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting with fleſh and blood, and diſobedience to Gods will revealed to them:<note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Theſe things being thus, it may be hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; 1.

The <hi>Gaderens</hi> after one mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle done among them, upon the loſſe of their ſwine, beſeech <hi>Chriſt to depart out of their coaſts.</hi> The <hi>Iewes at Antioch</hi> heare the Goſpell preached to them <hi>one Sabbath:</hi> but the <hi>next Sabbath</hi> drive the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> out of their citie. <hi>They of Capernaum and Bethſaida</hi> had many great <hi>works of Chriſt</hi> done among them; but <hi>repented not. Demas</hi> heard the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> walked with <hi>the Apoſtles</hi> for a time, but at length fell off to the <hi>preſent world. Iulian the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtata</hi> heard the <hi>Goſpell, profeſſed</hi> the ſame for a time, at length violently and maliciouſly <hi>perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>careleſneſſe and want of due conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> opens a very great gappe on <hi>mans part</hi> to his owne ruin. As not to regard the <hi>trumpet of Gods warning</hi> them: his <hi>miracles, promiſes, threats, &amp;c.</hi> to preferre mans <hi>folly</hi> before Gods <hi>wiſedome</hi> in the mouth of his meſſengers; to prefer this <hi>worlds wealth</hi> before the <hi>true treaſure; momentany</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures before pleaſures at <hi>Gods right hand for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more:</hi> To <hi>feare men</hi> that can but kill the body,

               <p n="3">3. That though <hi>Gods goodneſſe and mercy</hi> is ſuch that he <hi>knocks</hi> at mans heart,<note place="margin">Rev. 3.20.</note> and <hi>ſtands and abides knocking</hi> there; and notwithſtanding many and great ſinnes of infirmity and ignorance, &amp;c. <hi>ſtill continues</hi> ſuing to be admitted into the heart of man, <hi>drawing him</hi> to it by the preaching of the <hi>Miniſters, who work together with him;</hi>

               <p>Furthermore from theſe two ſections conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together, ariſe theſe concluſions.</p>
               <p n="1">I. That the condemnation of the wicked is meerly of &amp; from <hi>mans default;</hi> where the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet is not blowne, both by default <hi>of Rulers and teachers,</hi> and alſo in regard of <hi>their owne ſinnes,</hi> in which they dye.

               </p>
               <p n="2">II. That the wickedneſſe of the damned is not the cauſe of Gods will to damne them: for <hi>ſinne in man,</hi> which is evill, cannot produce <hi>juſtice in God</hi> (which is holy and good, and an attribute of God before ſinne ever was) as its effect: But <hi>Gods holy and juſt will</hi> is the ſquare of his actions.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4125:24"/>
is the cauſe of the traitors condemnation and death; but the law of the land being the <hi>rule of juſtice,</hi> is the cauſe, that the Iudge wils the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and puts to death the Traitor.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The worke of any of <hi>Gods free Graces and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours</hi> not merited by any man, proceedeth not <hi>de facto</hi> ſo farre with ſome men, as with others, <hi>by default of the men themſelves.</hi> The benefit of his <hi>raine &amp; ſun extends to all,</hi> ſo alſo many other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward gifts: Chriſt wrought one <hi>miracle</hi> among the <hi>Gadarens,</hi> but at that time preached not the word in their Cities; for <hi>they would not.

God cauſed the <hi>word</hi> to be preached to <hi>Demas,</hi> gave him ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie with the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> but left him to the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his heart <hi>imbracing this preſent world.</hi> God cauſed the <hi>word</hi> to bee preached to <hi>Iulian,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which he walked for a time, and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> but at length <hi>God</hi> left him to the cruelty of his owne heart to perſecute <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</hi> God made <hi>Iudas an Apoſtle;</hi> he according to his office walked a while, and preached the Goſpell; but at length God left him to the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe of his heart, to betray the <hi>Lord of life,</hi> and to deſperation.</p>
