            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>READER,</head>
            <p>THIS reprehensive Lamentation of
<hi>English Malignity,</hi> or hatred,
and scorn, and persecution of <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Godliness,</hi> by them who
profess to believe in God, and to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
was written in prison (but without
any provoking sense of my suffering) in
<hi>Anno</hi> 1685. or 1686. And by one that was
not wholly ignorant, how much of the Papists
counsel and power, was causal in our change
since the return of K. <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. 1660. And
therefore it grateth so much upon the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
though they were professed Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
who were the open Agents.</p>
            <p>It was written by one who can remember,
at least since 1627. that the serious practice
of Godliness was the common scorn of the
vulgar rabble; and he that did but read
the Scripture, and Books of Piety, and pray
in his family, and catechize Children or
Servants, or hear a Sermon at the next Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
<pb facs="tcp:99576:3"/>
Church from a Godly Conformist, when
he had none at home; yea that did but seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
talk of Christ or Scripture, or the Life
to come, or preparation for Death and Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
went under the name of a Puritane,
which was a reproach in the mouth of
drunkards, swearers, fornicators, and all the
sensual, worldly sort, both high and low.
And that Conformable Ministers (yea and
Gentlemen) that were but seriously Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
no more scap't this scorn than Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists
(who were then so few, that
they were in most places unknown.) He sadly
remembreth how greatly this malignant
rabble triumphed in the Bishops Visitation
Articles, and in the Preaching and Talk of
many Priests, who sharpened their Sermons
with Invectives against Puritans as dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Hypocrites, though they had not a
Nonconformist within many miles. He
heard the Godly Conformable Ministers la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that the Bishops and Ecclesiastical
Courts by their jealousie and heat against
the Nonconformable Puritans, became the
strength and encouragement of this malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
vitious rabble; and that the young
worldly Ministers took it for the way to
<pb facs="tcp:99576:3"/>
preferment, to Preach against Puritans,
while they treated the multitude of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
prayerless families that had no sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of serious Religion, as their good and
peaceable Flocks. He lived to see the
Godly Learned Conformists, so grieved for
this, that they long'd for a Reformation;
and many Conformists (as Bishop <hi>Robert
Abbot,</hi> Bishop <hi>Downame,</hi> &amp; divers others
published their Reproof and Lamentation
for it: And good <hi>Robert Bolton</hi> (in his
<hi>Directions for walking with God)</hi> thinks
that since Malice entred into the heart of
man, there was never a word tossed with
more Malice in the mouths of drunkards
and prophane men, than the word [Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.]
Hundreds and thousands of these
wicked scorners of Religion, were either
admitted (or driven) to the Sacrament, or
lived quietly in great Parishes while they
despised it, while these poor Puritans were
strictly hunted after! And if they fasted
and prayed with a dying or sick friend,
without getting a License for it from the
Bishop, the Church-warden must enter them
into their Inquisition, or be forsworn.</p>
            <p>These Puritans having the greatest
<pb facs="tcp:99576:4"/>
averseness to Popery, in some things were
too suspicious of all that they thought smell'd
of it: And when they heard that in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
the Papists had most barbarously mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the Protestants (two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand)
and that they boasted that they rose
by the King's Commission, and threatned
to invade <hi>England,</hi> and that the English
Papists were against the Parliament; this
made them think that the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
was not safe, but in the Parliaments
part and care: Upon which the next year
when our odious Civil War began, many of
them went into the Parliaments Armies:
But the generality would fain have lived
quietly at home, but the debauched rabble
and their Patrons would not suffer them:
But they turned the name <hi>Puritan</hi> into
<hi>[Roundhead]</hi> and <hi>[Down with the
Roundheads,]</hi> was the common Cry. I
have my self by the <hi>Cry</hi> been in present
danger, in passing through a City where no
man knew me, because I wore not long
Hair. If their Neighbours did but pray,
and sing a Psalm in their houses, the rabble
would (like the Sodomites at the door of
<hi>Lot)</hi> set up a Cry against them in the
<pb facs="tcp:99576:4"/>
streets, and say, <hi>[Down with the
Roundheads]</hi> the <hi>Rebels,</hi> a <hi>Gowry,</hi> a
<hi>Conspiracy,</hi> &amp;c.] Even where I lived
they assembled with weapons, and sought
my life, and knockt down (mortally by the
issue) even strangers in the streets that
medled not with them, because they were
accounted friends to the Puritans. By this
means the Parliaments Garrisons and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
were fill'd with Religious men, that
were forced to flie from their houses by the
malignant, ignorant drunkards, to save their
lives: And this, even this was the ruine
of K. <hi>Charles,</hi> and his Army, and of the
persecuting Bishops and Clergy. Necessity
made thousands to be Souldiers that could
not live at home: And most were moved
by an Argument, that was not cogent, still
saying, <hi>[We cannot believe that God
would suffer the generality of the most
Religious to chuse the wrong side, and
the generality of the Papists and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
drunkards and malignants to be in
the right.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O what shame and pity is it that the
Antipuritan Clergy no better remembred
from 1660. till now, by what means they
<pb facs="tcp:99576:5"/>
fell; and that they no more understood, nor
yet understand, what a torrent of sin, of
danger, and of shame, is come upon them,
by their strengthning themselves by sheltring
(to say no worse) the sensual irreligious
malignant rabble (Rich and Poor) that
they may tread down the Puritans, that
by their own doings are brought into a
dislike of them. Will God ever bless a
prophane rabble (or Gentry) to be the
honour and strength of the Church, against
the Religious that desire a Reformation?</p>
            <p>It is not their new foolish names and
scorns, (as Whigs, Trimmers, Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
<hi>&amp;c.)</hi> that will prove that it is not
serious Piety that they hate: As long as
the most filthy wicked livers are the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
and Accusers, and in their own
Party and Companions, the vilest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery
passeth for sufferable, and a small
disgrace, and thousands of such live at
ease, when preaching the Gospel, and
praying without their Fetters or Book, must
cost men ruine, and imprisonment, and
scorn. And <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> his sharp
Invective against <hi>Ithacius, Idacius,</hi> and
the rest of the Bishops in their Synod was,
<pb facs="tcp:99576:5"/>
that in prosecuting the <hi>Priscillian</hi> Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks,
they brought the matter to that pass,
that if Godly men did but fast, and pray,
and read Scripture, the Bishops made them
suspected as Priscillianists (even St. <hi>Martin</hi>
himself.) Woe to them that turn the sacred
Offices of Magistracy and Ministry against
God that did ordain them, to be used as
in his name, and in some representation of
himself, sacrilegiously blaspheming him as
an Enemy to himself. Shall the Throne of
Iniquity have fellowship with God, that
frameth mischief by a Law, to make sin
common and allowed?</p>
            <p>By this the Reader may see that there is a
double History needful to the full understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this Book; and of the nature and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of <hi>Malignity;</hi> that is, 1. The History of
<hi>Adam</hi>'s fall, and the great depravation of
humane nature thence arising; and the true
meaning of the Enmity thence put between
the Womans and the Serpents seed, exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified
in the two first Brothers born into the
world; as also in <hi>Ishmael</hi> and <hi>Isaac, Esau</hi>
and <hi>Jacob;</hi> and frequently mentioned by
Christ and his Apostles.</p>
            <p>2. The History of the advantages that
<pb facs="tcp:99576:6"/>
Malignity hath got in <hi>England</hi> since the
Reformation; and especially since the return
of <hi>Charles</hi> the second. This must contain
the sad differences begun at <hi>Frankford</hi> in
Q. <hi>Marys</hi> days; the errours and extreams
of both the differing Parties; the by assing
determinations of Q. <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the first Bishops that had been
exiles, and their Successors; the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
provocations by over-opposing Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,
and the Bishops design to root them
out; and the making of the Canons to that
end: The rise of a new sort of Bishops, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
in <hi>Laud, Neile, Howson, Corbet</hi> and
<hi>Buckeridge,</hi> with <hi>Mountague,</hi> and their
growth under <hi>Buckingham</hi> against the old
Churchmen: The design of a Coalition with
<hi>Rome,</hi> and the French and English at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
thereto: The interruption of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
by the first Long Parliament, and the
Wars: The Scots forcing the Parliament
(that in their straits asked their help) to
take their Covenant: The imposing that
Covenant on the whole Ministry, and
making it a dividing Engine on pretence of
Unity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Parliaments casting out (with
a multitude of flagitious Ministers) some
<pb facs="tcp:99576:6"/>
Doctors, for being against them, for the
King, contrary to the desires of Peace-makers:
The Presbyterians under <hi>Monk</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
King <hi>Charles</hi> the second: The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
and preferment of his Doctors, and
their revengeful resolutions: Their design to
get all Church-power and Preferment, and
Academick Rule into the hands of them that
most hated Puritans, or would endeavour their
extirpation, and would educate Youth in bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
prejudice and hatred of them: The vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
hatred of serious Godliness in Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists
and Nonconformists, under the name of
Puritans: The power that a few returned
Doctors had with the King and Chancellor
in the dispose of Preferments, and thereby
to over-rule the Parliament, and to procure
the Acts of Uniformity, Corporation Oaths,
Vestry and Militia Oaths, and the Acts for
Banishments, Confinements, Imprisonments,
Fining, Ejecting, Silencing and Ruining
such whose Consciences pleaded Gods Law
and Authority against any of their Oaths,
Impositions, and silencing Prohibitions to
preach the Gospel: The great difference in
the Wars (I meddle not with the Cause) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Adherents and Souldiers of the
<pb facs="tcp:99576:7"/>
K. <hi>(Ch. I.)</hi> and the Parliaments in point
of Piety and Sobriety: The Animosity and
implacable heat, by which the before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered,
and now Ruling Party, proceeded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the ruine of those that they took for
Enemies to the Cause Civil or Ecclesiastick,
which they had owned: The unhappiness of
the then present Ministry, that being young
then, had never medled with Wars, that they
must equally suffer as Enemies, for fearing
the Imposed Oaths, Subscriptions, Covenants
and Practices: The rejoycing of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sort of the luxurious, drunkards, whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers
and Infidels, that they had got so
many of the Religious into contempt, and
scorn, and ruine: The woful increase of
Whoredom, Luxury, and Impiety and Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism
hereupon: The great numbers of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
people, who before hoped for Peace and
a pious Prelacy, that fell hereupon into an
hatred of Prelacy, and a great disesteem of
the Conforming Ministry; and so our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
are grown to a fixed factious Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and malice and worldly interest will hear
no motions or petitions for Peace; and yet
madly plead all for Love and Peace, while
they implacably fight against them, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
<pb facs="tcp:99576:7"/>
those as the Enemies of Peace, who
beg Peace of them, and cannot obtain it.</p>
            <p>This is the sum of the doleful History
which this Book presupposeth: But should I

four years, at first because it would not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured,

Church Reformation would make such a
complaint less necessary. But now I perceive
the Devil will be the Devil, and Mankind
will be born <hi>blind, sensual</hi> and <hi>malignant,</hi>
till there be a <hi>new Heaven and Earth in
which dwelleth Righteousness.</hi> Come

            <head>Chap. I. A Lamentation for the case of the
Deluded, Malignant, Militant World.</head>
            <p>§ 1. THE depraved and miserable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Mankind, hath long been the
astonishing wonder of the sober and inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
part of the world: Philosophers were
puzzled with the difficult questions, <hi>whence it
first came?</hi> and <hi>why it is no more remedied?</hi>
Christians are taught by the sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
how to answer both, by laying it on
mans <hi>misusing of his free will,</hi> supposing Gods
permission of his tryal and temptations; and
on his resistance and rejection of remedying
grace, in the degree that it is vouchsaft or
offered. But still there are difficulties, and
our understandings are dark, and hardly satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
And whence ever it comes, the case is
doleful, and we cannot but think of it with
astonishment and lamentation. When we
saw an hundred thousand made dead corps
by the <hi>London</hi> Plague 1665. it did not take off
the terrour to know <hi>how it begun.</hi> And when
we saw the City on a dreadful flame, which
none could stop, it cured not the general
astonishment to conjecture <hi>how it was kindled</hi>
or <hi>carried on:</hi> No doubt but Hell it self pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimeth
that God is <hi>Holy, Wise</hi> and <hi>Iust,</hi> and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99576:9"/>
Devils and Men are the cause of their own
everlasting punishment. But yet if we had a
sight of it, amazement and dread would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm
us. And, alas! what a Map of Hell is
the greatest part of Earth? Hell is a place
of <hi>Lying, Malignant</hi> and <hi>murderous, hurtful
Spirits, miserable by</hi> and <hi>for</hi> their wickedness:
And is not this in a lower degree, a true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of most of the Earth?</p>
            <p>§ 2. Nineteen parts in Thirty of the
Earth are Idolaters and Heathens: And do I
need to say, how ignorant, wicked and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
they are? Many of them publickly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the Devil, as Witches do with us; and
he deludeth them, and appeareth in divers
shapes to them, and ruleth them as he doth
Witches. And those that are more civil are
strangers or enemies to Christ: Six parts
of the thirty are Ignorant Mahometans, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyers
indeed of Heathenish Idolatry, and
such as take Christ for a great and true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
but know him not as a Saviour, but
equal or prefer a gross Deceiver, and live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
barbarous Tyrants who by violence keep
them in the dark. The other five parts that
are called Christians, alas! consist most of
people bred up in lamentable Ignorance,
mostly barbarous or debased by the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Tyrants; such as the Moscovites, most
of the Greeks, the Abassines, Armenians, and
many Eastern Sects and Nations. What Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
the vulgar Papists are bred in, in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99576:9"/>
               <hi>Italy, Spain, Germany, Poland, France,</hi> and
other Countreys, and what enmity to true
Reformation prevaileth in Princes, Priests
and People; and by what <hi>Lying</hi> and <hi>Cruelty</hi>
they fight against Truth, and what Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Murders and inhumane Massacres have
been their powerful means, I need not use
many words to tell.</p>
            <p>And are the Protestant Reformed
Churches free from fleshly, worldly, wicked
men? from ignorant malignant cruel Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to Truth, and Piety, and Peace?</p>
            <p>§ 3. Our Kings Dominions are the best
and happiest Nations on Earth. Here is most
Knowledge of the Truth, and most propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
that truly Love it, and live in a holy
obedience thereto, and fain would live a quiet
and peaceable life in all godliness, honesty
and sobriety: But, alas! they must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with their own personal uprightness
and reward, and the peace of their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
in Gods acceptance. But with men
there seemeth to be no hopes of common
<hi>Wisdom,</hi> Piety, Love and Peace.</p>
            <p>We are all baptised with one Baptism; we
all profess to be the servants of one God, and
the faithful followers of one Christ, and to
believe in one Holy sanctifying Spirit, and
to believe the same Canonical Scriptures as
the Word of God, indited by that Spirit;
and to be of one Holy Catholick Church,
which is all the Members of Christ on
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99576:10"/>
Earth; and to hold the Communion of Saints:
We mostly in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> agree in
the Protestant Reformed Doctrine, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments;
Our concord in profession is so
great, that if some men had not devised some
Oaths, Professions, Covenants, Practices
and Knacks, and Engines of their own (which
they dare not say, God made) to become
the matter of our unavoidable dissent, they
could hardly have known how to pretend
any difference in religion among us, and hell
would scarce have found any Cloak for
malicious accusations, enmity and discord.</p>
            <p>You shall scarce meet with a man that will
not speak well of Love and Peace, and say
that <hi>we must Love God above all, and our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
as our selves, and do as we would have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
do to us.</hi> And yet is there any Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or Disagreement? Alas how great, and
how uncureable?</p>
            <p>§ 4. Who would think that knew us not
by our Profession, but only by our Actions,
but that the three Kingdoms consisted of the
deadliest Enemies to each other? Of Turks
and Christians; of Wolves and Sheep, that
I say not of Devils and Men? Yea Turks and
Christians can live together in <hi>Hungary</hi> and
all the Eastern Countreys; <hi>Orthodox</hi> and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
can live together, in <hi>Poland, Helvetia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Holland,</hi> &amp;c. But Protestants and Protestants
cannot live together in <hi>Britain.</hi> Cities and
Corporations, Countreys and Churches, i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:99576:10"/>
not Families also, are distracted in enmity and
more than mental feuds and war. <hi>Guelphes</hi>
and <hi>Gibelines,</hi> party against party, studying
Accusations against each other, as if they
were Scholars daily exercised in the School
of him that is the Accuser of the Brethren.
All their Learning and Wit is called up, and
poured out, to render others as odious as
they are able. All their power, interest,
friends and diligence are used to ruine and
destroy each other. No lies or perjury with
some seem unlawful to accomplish so desired
an effect. In all companies, the discourse and
converse that should be to edifie each other
in Love, and comfort each other by the
hopes of dwelling together in Heaven, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up with slanders, backbitings, scorning,
railing and plotting the overthrow of the
best of their neighbours. Innocency never
wants odious or scornful names: As if they
were acting their part that called Christ and
his Apostles, and the ancient Christians, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers,
Blasphemers, Enemies to</hi> Caesar, <hi>Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders</hi>
of <hi>Sedition,</hi> that <hi>taught men to worship
God contrary to the Law.</hi> Every drunkard and
wicked liver can as easily make his conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
neighbour a Rogue, or a Traitor, or a
Schismatick, or an Hypocrite, as he can open
his mouth and speak. And to justifie all this
malice is become a virtue; hating the most
religious, is Zeal for Government and Order;
destroying Christs Members, is standing up
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99576:11"/>
for the Church; hunting them as Dogs do
Hares, or as Hawks do the lesser birds, is a
meritorious work, of supererogation no
doubt, and will not finally lose its reward:
God is served by hating and scorning them
that are serious in his service. It is Religion
to make Religion odious, and call it Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie,
and to be for that which is uppermost,
and befriends their worldly Interest, and to
make him suspected of Disloyalty, who is for
obedience to God. Conscience, and fear of
sinning, and of damnation, is the mortal ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to be conquered or driven out of the
Land; as if there were no quietness to be
expected in mens minds, no concord in the
Church, no obedience to the Clergy, or the
Laws, no safety from Sedition, till Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
be silenced or banished, and men give
over fearing God; or as if Christ and <hi>Caesar</hi>
could not both reign, but God or Princes
must be dethroned.</p>
            <p>And O that the sacred Tribe were inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and none of them were the leaders in
such hypocritical malignity! Their Canons
<hi>ipso facto</hi> excommunicate all (not excepting
Princes, Parliaments or Judges) that do but
say, <hi>that any of their Ceremonies, Liturgy, or
Officers in Church Government,</hi> (not excepting
the lowest or Lay-mens power of the Church
Keys by decreeing Excommunications and
Absolutions) <hi>are repugnant to the Word of God:</hi>
And when they have <hi>ipso facto</hi> Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99576:11"/>
them all, they call them Separatists for
not coming to their Communion: Think not
the contradiction and hypocrisy incredible:
read but the 5, 6, 7, and 8. Canons, and judge.
They have a Law, and by their Law he is
cut off from the Church or Christ, that doth
but call any of these the Inventions of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
sinful, or say that God forbids them;
And the Jail must be his dwelling till he die
there, who in ten cases remaineth Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
and doth not openly profess that
he repenteth, and judgeth that to be sinless,
which he is utterly unable so to judge.
When we have preached seven and seven
years, to perswade a Drunkard, a Liar, and
Prophane swearer, an Atheist, to Repent,
he liveth quietly out of the Jail though he
repent not: But if a man repent not (when
he cannot) of judging that God forbids such
humane inventions and impositions in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
take him Jaylor; He that will not be
for our humane Offices, Ceremonies and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
shall not be of our Church; And
when we have cast him out, we'll say, He
separateth: and if he be not of our Church,
he shall be in Jail; As if the Church and the
Jail, would hold all the land, except his sin
be such a Peccadillo as Atheism, Sadduceism,
Bestiality, Hobbism, Popery, Man-slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Adultery, Drunkenness, Swearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
not aggravated by the crimes of breaking the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99576:12"/>
Canons in point of conformity; Or if many
thousands cannot or will not come within the
Doors of the Parish Church, so they will
go to no unlicensed preacher, nor worship
God in House or Church at all, they live
quietly out of Prison. But if the mote of an
Oath or Ceremony scrupled be in their eye,
that eye must be pulled out (if the mote can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not)
or else the whole body be cast into their
Hell. And if the Preacher be but a Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
of Domination, his way is oft to call to
the Magistrate to execute the Law upon such
as dare presume to worship God openly, till
they hold all such imposed Oaths, Covenants,
Professions and Practices to be lawful: He is
to make his auditory believe that such men
are dangerous, intolerable persons, and that
their meeting to worship God and learn their
duty, is to cherish Sedition, Heresy and Schism,
and that Rebellion is in their hearts; and
that the Preachers that even to a thing indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
are not of their mind and obedience,
are deceivers, and factious, and it is no sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
but a duty to forbid them to preach
the Gospel. If the People dare not trust the
Parson, Vicar or Curate of the Parish, (be
he what he will, whom a—Patron choos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for them) with the Pastoral Ordinary
conduct of their Souls, or if he Preach not at
all, if they go to the next Parochial confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
for the Sacrament, he is to be driven
home, and used as disobedient.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:99576:12"/>
Through the great mercy of God while
the Bible is Licensed, a Preacher in <hi>England</hi>
knoweth not how to spend his hour, if he
say not somewhat for Faith and Godliness,
Love and Peace: And when they come
down, none are so hated by some of them,
as those that believe and do to their utmost
what they for fashion sake perswaded them
to believe and do. Their neighbours who
have not a word with the Priest of any thing
but this World, nor read a chapter or put up
a prayer in their families, these are good and
quiet neighbours; But if any seriously pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
for their everlasting state, and mind
their Salvation above the World, especially
if he pray without-book, and dislike the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and scandalous lives of sorry Priests,
these are the dangerous troublers of the land,
away with them, and give us those that trouble
us not with the talk of God and of death, and
Heaven or Hell, of Scripture or of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and that scruple nothing that we would
have them say or do. If such pray, it is but
in hypocrisy; If they go to hear any other
Preacher, it is in faction. If they speak any
words to God which are not written down
for them to read, they sawcily prate to God
and speak but nonsence; If they be earnest
as knowing what they pray for, they do but
whine and cut faces, and speak through the
Nose, or are a pack of groaning Hypocrites.
It is confest that the spirit of Adoption and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99576:13"/>
Supplication is Gods Gift; and that this Spirit
taught the Bishops and Convocation in what
words to pray to God: But if the most holy or
learned man besides them pretend to it, and
think that any may pray by the Spirits help
but the Convocation, there are reverend
men that will deride that <hi>Spirit</hi> or that <hi>prayer.</hi> I
would at least they would let men pray by
<hi>reason</hi> and the sense of <hi>their Souls necessities</hi>
(as a Child will beg pardon of an offended
Father,) if they will not give them leave to
pray by that Spirit (which all must live by
that will be saved.)</p>
            <p>Physicians use their patients with some
humanity, and will not say to him that saith,
<hi>[My stomach cannot take down this Potion; I
shall cast it up] You shall take it or die, or go to
Prison:</hi> Or if one say, <hi>[This Pill is bigger than
my Throat can swallow,]</hi> They will rather say,
<hi>It shall be made less</hi> than they will cut his
Throat wider to get it down. And sure the
reason is because the Law doth make them
Physicians to none but Volunteers, and give
them no compelling power: If it did, I
know not what inhumanity they might come
to: For I will not believe that there is any
thing in Divinity which tendeth to make
men more inhumane than Physicians. I
have seen <hi>Iews</hi> and others that will eat no
swines flesh; And I have known many that
a tast of Cheese would cast into a swound
near death: And I never knew any say, <hi>you
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99576:13"/>
shall eat this, or die:</hi> Nor that ever motioned
the making of a Law that all men should be
imprisoned, or forbidden all other meat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who
refused to eat Swines-flesh, for fear of tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
Jews.</p>
            <p>But we have Priests too many, that will
say, <hi>Take every Oath, Promise or Ceremony re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of you, or preach not, nor worship God
openly at all:</hi> Take me for your Pastor, or
you shall have none: Hear me, or hear no
man: Receive the Communion from me, or
from none: Deny not the lawfulness of a
Ceremony, or be Excommunicate.</p>
            <p>§ 4. And is it now any wonder that the
people say as they are taught? And these are
lessons easilier learnt than a Catechism, or
the Creed, or the meaning of Baptism. How
quickly can a man learn to call his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Whig, or Tory! Or to hate a Godly
man, or in a Tavern or Ale-house to scorn
them, or drink and curse to their confusion,
and to say, I hope to see them all hang'd or
banished out of the Land: As a Priest that
knows not what Divinity or the Priestly
Office is, may before he taketh many degrees,
attain the ability learnedly to call his Godly
Neighbours, Schismaticks, or Hypocrites or
worse; So no doubt a few such Sermons, if
not a Tavern, can quickly teach them that
never knew what Religion is, yea that can
scarce speak sense, to revile the wisest and
best men, as if they were sinners against the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99576:14"/>
true Religion, if they will be serious in any
true Religion at all.</p>
            <p>§ 5. O sinful! O miserable Land! Who
kindled all the hellish flames of thy maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and mad divisions? And who continueth
them, and for what? What cloven foot hath
entred, and expelled concord? What Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
ruleth thee? Were it the Spirit of Christ,
it would be for healing, Love and Concord;
It would set men on studying to promote
Love to all, even unto enemies, but much
more to the most holy. It would make men
zealous of good works, and if it were possible
as much as in them lieth to live peacebly
with all men, to bless those that curse them,
to pray for those that hate and persecute
them, forbearing and forgiving one another,
even as God for Christs sake forgiveth us.
It would teach them while they have time
to do good to all men, but especially to them
of the houshold of Faith; Mens hearts would
be constituted of Love: It would become a
nature in them. Their Speech and Converse
would be the Savoury breath of Love: Their
dealings towards all men would be the works
of Love: Their sharpest reproofs would be
but to do the sinner good.</p>
            <p>But alas another Spirit hath possessed thee
which rageth and teareth thee; and is blind
and deaf; It calleth for Fire from Heaven,
and it kindleth a fire of Hell: And sure his
name is <hi>Legion;</hi> for there are many. It
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99576:14"/>
passeth under the names of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred</hi>
of some evil: But it must needs be Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Sensual and Devilish, for it is neither
Pure, nor Peaceable, Gentle, or Merciful and
Impartial, but foameth with bitter envy and
strife, unto confusion and every evil work:
And yet thou knowest not what manner of
Spirit thou art of.</p>
            <p>Is it God that setteth rulers and people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
each other. Doth he divide his own
Kingdom, against it self, when he tells us that
the Devil will not do so by his. Is it God
that sets the parts of the same body in a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
and War against each other? As if it
were the interest of the nobler and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
parts to weaken or destroy each other?
And it were an addition to the health and
welfare of the one, which is gotten by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
from the other? Is it God that mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
people despise or dishonour their lawful
Governours, or any Rulers to hate the best
Subjects, and desire more to be feared than
to be loved, and rather to have power to do
hurt, than actually to do good? Is it God
that sets Corporations, and Churches and
Neighbours and Families, in a state of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
Vexation, Strife, and a kind of War
against each other? Doth the Spirit of God
indite the malicious Pamphlets, which exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
the utmost of Wit and Hatred, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Love, and to call the Nation into the
Devils Camp, by mutual hatred to live as
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99576:15"/>
Enemies, and Fight against the Lord and the
ways of Peace. And if any endeavour a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling
healing of our wounds, it's turned
into scorn, and his healing motions are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
as the grand causes of division;
and to beg for peace is heinous Schism, and
next Rebellion against the Church, and a
crime sufficient to forfeit that mans Peace
and Reputation: And he that tells men of
the only possible terms of Concord, is made
the chiefest cause of discord. To serve and
worship God no otherwise than <hi>Peter</hi> and
<hi>Paul</hi> did, and than God prescribeth is enough
to render us unworthy to live on <hi>English</hi>
Earth? And if <hi>England</hi> may not suffer such,
why should any other nation suffer them?
There are men that keep holy days for
St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and dedicate Churches
to them, and their bellies are maintained at
<hi>Dives</hi> rates, and their Wealth and Revenues
and Grandure held up, by that which is dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to these Churches, (and to alienate any
of this superfluity from their flesh were worse
Sacriledge than to cast out and silence a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
faithful Preachers;) And yet if St. <hi>Paul</hi>
were a Preacher now in <hi>France, Spain, Italy</hi>
or <hi>England,</hi> and would worship God but as
he did when he was on Earth, and would not
swear, say and do as much more as the
Bishops Canons bid him, I think we should
again hear those words, <hi>Acts 22. 22. Away
with such a fellow from the Earth, for it is not fit
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99576:15"/>
that he should live</hi> (here:) Unless he wrought
miracles to convince men: And whether
those would prevail is a doubtful case; or
whether he would not pass for a Deceiver
and Fanatick.</p>
            <p>§ 6. As in times of War, all broken, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly
and idle fellows, turn Souldiers, as the
easiest trade to live by, and are never after
good for any other trade, but to kill and rob
men; So the <hi>Love-killing Regiments,</hi> have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
other trades, and this is like to put
down all. Booksellers complain that they
can fell few Books but News and Scorning
or Invective Libels. And what is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of our (formerly weekly and now daily)
News Books? Why, they tell us that such a
City or Corporation are altogether by the
Ears as Enemies, some choosing one Mayor
and some another; Some called <hi>Whigs,</hi> and
others <hi>Tories;</hi> Some seeking the ruine and
Blood of others, and some hardly escaping
the power of false Witnesses and Oaths!
One Jury acquitting a man whose life is sought,
and another condemning him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In such a
Town or City so many find, and so many
distreined on, and so many crowded into
Jails, and such and such Preachers cast into
Prison, and such a one dead there, for pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to God and openly worshipping him
without-book, or by no book but his own.
In such and such a Country the people prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
each other on such accounts, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99576:16"/>
some flying into other parts, and some into
<hi>America</hi> to seek that peace among Savages
and Wolves, and Serpents, in Wildernesses,
which they could not have under sacred Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Prelates and their Clergy. In <hi>France</hi>
the poor Protestants hunted like Hares, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
suffered to live at home, nor to flie
naked to beg their bread in other Lands;
and all this for the concord and peace of the
holy Catholick Church; a pattern so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of imitation, that even such excellent
men as <hi>Grotius</hi> think, that it's worth all ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards,
labour and cost, to reduce <hi>England</hi> and
the Lutherans to the French-Church-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence,
and to silence and ruine all as Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinists
that are against it. From <hi>Hungary</hi> we
must read, how the persecuted Protestants,
after their utmost suffering and patience, are
fain to call in Turks to save them from the
cruelties of Christians. And that those parts
that are under the Turks have far more

            <p>These and such other are the subjects of
our News-books, which have broken the
poor <hi>Booksellers,</hi> who were wont to live by
selling Books of Learning, and of practical
Divinity. And too many Preachers are fain
to be short as well as formal in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
for Christian Love, because they spend
so much time in Preaching up hatred and
destruction. Were there but any Art that
could devise any Engine that could reach the
heart, and turn it into the hatred of those
that never did them wrong (as they say some
Philters and Charms will make men mad
with Love;) Or if any Apothecary had an
effectual Medicine against brotherly Love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I
doubt these would become the most accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
Shops and prosperous Trades in all
the City: But for want of such, some Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits,
Printers Booksellers, Clubs, Drinking-houses,
and Play-houses (to pass by fouler)
must serve the turn. But if God have not
mercy on the Land by restraining them,
Gunpowder-makers, Gun-smiths, Sword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers,
Souldiers, Swearers and Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
will swallow up most other Trades in
the Land. It's worth enquiry whether in
foresight of this, they set not their Sons to
such Trades as these, or Apprentices to such
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99576:17"/>
Lawyers as are best at preparative Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and have learnt <hi>Tertullus</hi>'s Art: Or to
such Schools and Tutors as can teach them
the Learning of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> and the four
hundred Prophets, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.</p>
            <p>§ 7. And all this is the more unexcusable
and lamentable, because they came but late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
out of the fire, which this same malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Spirit kindled; The very same causes
cast the three Kingdoms into dreadful Flames
and Blood. The Histories of the bloody
murder of many hundred thousands called
<hi>Albigenses, Waldenses</hi> and <hi>Bohemians,</hi> in
<hi>Piedmont, Germany</hi> and elsewhere, and of the
Netherland cruelties, the <hi>Spanish</hi> Inquisition
and Invasions, the murder of thirty or forty
thousand at once in <hi>France,</hi> and of two of
their Kings, the Powder Plot here, as well
as the Bonefires in Q <hi>Marys</hi> days, and
much more their Councils and Doctors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
and commanding such usage of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
did set all our Parliaments one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another into a vehement unwillingness to
be so used, and to fall into their hands that
will do it if they can: And when the evil
Spirit had raised cross interests and distrusts
between King and Parliament, the Papists
seeming to be for the War and King, and
suddenly murdering in <hi>Ireland</hi> no fewer than
two hundred thousand, and pretending the
Kings Commission, and threatning the like
in <hi>England,</hi> affrightned the People into the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99576:17"/>
Army, after raised by the Parliament. And
though I think all that War in <hi>England</hi> kill'd
not the fourth part so many as the Papists
had murdered in <hi>Ireland;</hi> yet so dismal and
odious was it, and had so direful an end, as
loudly told us how bad the causes and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
were. Few parts of the Land were
free from spoil, plunder and poverty; yea or
from terrible Sieges and fields of blood:
English-men labouring to destroy each other,
and some hiring Forreigners to help them:
And Lads running from their Parents to be
as Apprentices to the Man-killing Trade.
Counties were against Counties, Cities against
Cities, Neighbours against Neighbours,
single persons flying from Men as from Bears
and Tygers, as after in the Plague-time, afraid
of almost all that they met. And at last the
very Armies falling out among themselves:
The first raised for the Parliament, were
mastered by a second Party, that brought
in (as Auxiliaries) a new Imposition; and that
Party after mastered and cast down by a third
that brought in a new Cause; and that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing,
pulling down their Masters, an Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
odiously destroying the King, and setting
up himself with another Title, and subduing
and ruining those that were against it, even
both the Parties that began the War: And
yet when he was dead, to shew the World
what divisions can do, that same Victorious,
Rebellious Army, fell all into pieces by its
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99576:18"/>
own discord, and was totally dissolved as by
a miracle, without one drop of blood that
ever I could hear of; and the Victorious
leaders many of them hang'd, drawn and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
and their heads and quarters hang'd up
on the City Gates.</p>
            <p>And would not one think that a Nation of
men in their wits, should after so long and
sad experience of the mischiefs of hatred
and division, be willing of the reviving of
Love and Concord, and hate all motions of
dividing any more? But alas, they hate them
that would heal our wounds; and if any one
lay on a healing Plaister, there are hands too
many both Lay and Clergy, ready with rage
to pull it off, and yet it's all on pretence of
healing us, that they will not suffer us to be
healed; for the way of peace they have not
known. Unhappy Surgeons, that know no
Balsom but Corrosives and Distilled Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
yea no way of healing but by dismem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring,
even the usefullest members of the
Body. Having learned of the Romish Leeches
that live on blood, when they are for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausting
the vital Stock, and cast the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
into a Palsy or <hi>Marasmus,</hi> they tell you
it was all but corrupt or haemorrhoidal blood,
and the loss of it necessary to cure the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Land.</p>
            <p>The beginning of some reconciliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the first contending Parties, began to
flatter us with the hopes of Restored Love
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99576:18"/>
and Quietness: Secret consultations prepared
the way: Lords, Knights and Gentlemen,
Print their Protestations for Oblivion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,
and against Revenge. Hereupon
those that by Land and Sea, in the three
Kingdoms had fought against the King, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
him: The land rejoyceth in the smiling
hopes of reviving Charity and Concord:
The King chiefly causeth these hopes by his
Declarations and Act of Oblivion, and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
his healing Gracious Declaration about
Ecclesiastical Affairs. The house of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
and the City Ministers give him thanks
for it: Who would have thought now but
such Experience, such Protestations, such
Obligations, such Authorities should have
put the whole Kingdom into a longing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to perfect the work of Love and Peace?
But it proved clean contrary: Some had other
things in their Heads and Hearts; outlandish
Fashions, especially <hi>French,</hi> have long been
the Badge of <hi>English</hi> folly! There are men
in <hi>Spain</hi> that trade much in the fire, and
Queen <hi>Mary</hi> brought the trade into <hi>England:</hi>
There are men in many other Forreign
Lands, who are so devout that their Canons
and Religion rule their appetites; And they
love no meat like a Carbonado'd Protestant,
nor are pleased with any Perfume or Incense
so much as with the smell of a rosted Saint,
first call'd a Heretick or Schismatick: Like
the Roman Tyrant that gloried in the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99576:19"/>
of the smell when he smelt the stink of the
Carcasses which he had laid to dung the Field.
And there were men abroad that learnt these
Fashions, and Contracted such a familiarity
and Love to Forreigners, as that for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Union with them, all the Divisions,
Distractions and Calamities of <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Scotland,</hi> are not thought too dear a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:
And as some Sons of Nonconformists
must be doubly virulent to expiate the guilt
of their Original sin; So some <hi>English</hi> men
must like <hi>Sampson</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> bring double
Testimony of their real enmity to the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines,
from their Skins, before they can be
trusted abroad as real reconcilers: And they
say that there are some things that will be
closely united, by no cement so well as by
humane blood. Doubtless the Gospel as used
in <hi>English,</hi> and Preached by true Protestants,
(such as the <hi>Pseudo-Bellamie</hi> in <hi>Philanax
Anglicus</hi> hatefully calleth <hi>Protestants</hi> off <hi>Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,)</hi>
goeth not with many beyond Sea, for
the same Gospel which they believe. And
therefore no wonder if the Preachers of it
be unpleasing to them; and he that will
please them, and unite with them, must si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
or oppose those that they would have
to be silenced and disgraced. And some think
that Union with many Kingdoms of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
which call themselves the Catholick
Church, is much to be preferred before the
Love and Concord of a hated party in our
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99576:19"/>
Island. And as Dr. <hi>Saywell</hi> (the Master of a
Colledge and Bishop <hi>Gunnings</hi> Chaplain)
saith (to prove that there is a Universal Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative
and Judicial power in the Clergy,
over Kingdoms as well Persons;)<q> 
                  <hi>[If more
persons or particular Churches give offence by
Heresy, Schism,</hi> &amp;c. The CHURCH UNI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERSAL,
<hi>or the rest of the Bishops may reprove
them for it, and then there is no Reason why one
man should be censured and many should go free,
and consequently our Saviour hath established the
Authority of his Church over all Christians as
well particular Churches as private men: Churches
of Kingdoms and Nations have a</hi> SOVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAIGNTY
<hi>over them to which they must
yield obedience,</hi> Isa. 60. 12. <hi>The Nation and
Kingdom that will not serve thee, shall perish: yea
those Nations shall be utterly wasted,</hi> pag. 343.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Though Kings have no Civil Universal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
over them but Christ, yet it seems all
the world both Kings and Kingdoms have
an Ecclesiastical Soveraignty over them all:
Communion of equalls and Christian Counsel
and Reproof is not enough, such as all Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Princes may use towards one another;
Nor the denial of such Communion to the
uncapable! But all Kings and Kingdoms must
be under one Church Soveraignty, which
hath a Legislative &amp; Judicial power over them
all, to excommunicate, absolve them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
how much more <hi>in ordine ad Spiritua<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ia</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
exposition of Ecclesiastical Power tells
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99576:20"/>
you: As experience long told many Kingdoms
what the Excommunicating of a King, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicting
a Kingdom the worship of God, do
signify towards their Dethroning or Invasion.</p>
            <p>And all this must be done, not as for the
Pope, but under the name of a General
Council, and the poor Pope shall have no
power but, say some, to call that Council, and
call it General when there is no such thing,
and preside in it, and rule us as chief Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch
and St. <hi>Peters</hi> Successor, in the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
of General Councils (that is, continually)
and that not <hi>Arbitrarily,</hi> but by the Laws of
the Church or Councils, (and no mortal man
can tell which those Authorized Legislative
Councils are, among the hundreds of erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
or contradicting ones.) So that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
in <hi>England</hi> is an abhorred thing; for it
is nothing with some but the <hi>Popes absolute
Government of the whole Church, as without or
above Laws and Ecclesiastick Parliaments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And can you reconcile all this to our
Oath of Supremacy, and the Canons that
establish it, <hi>renouncing all forreign Iurisdiction?</hi>
Yes easily, we have been told it meaneth
only <hi>forreign Civil Iurisdiction which belongs to
the King, and not forreign Ecclesiastical Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi>
(which is all that the sober Popes do
claim, save indirectly <hi>in ordine ad Spiritualia)</hi>
To Command a Nation on pain of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
and Damnation (according to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Councils) to renounce their Allegiance
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99576:20"/>
to their Excommunicate Prince, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
him and set up another, is no act of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
but of Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, which
yet hath dethroned Emperours and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
Dominions.</p>
            <p>And saith <hi>A.</hi> Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> (in Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet's</hi>
defence of him, <hi>p. 540. [It doth not
follow, because the Church may err, therefore
She may not Govern. For the Church hath not
only a</hi> PASTORAL <hi>Power, to Teach and
Direct, but a</hi> PRETORIAN <hi>also, to controul
and censure,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And for external obedience to
General Councils when they err, [Consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be not fit to allow a General council that
honour and priviledge which all other Great Courts
have:</hi> Stillingfleet, <hi>p. 534.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that instead of a Council of equals for
concord (as Princes use for peace with their
neighbours,) We have an <hi>Vniversal Soveraign
Court set up with Pretorian Power, to make bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Laws, and pass Iudgment to all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
World, and (say some) They are Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
that obey not these Vniversal Laws, and
obedience to them, and suppressing all forbidden As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
for Gods worship is the only way to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
concord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And where this forreign Jurisdiction is
made of such absolute necessity, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
subjection to it by Kings and Kingdoms,
there is no concord to be had, nor any avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the guilt of Schism, what wonder if
some can wish that silencings, reproaches,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99576:21"/>
ruines, and confusions may be thought no
dear price to obtain an universal union; for
which Christ and his Law are insufficient.

where our difference and danger lyeth.</p>
            <p>§ 8. And is <hi>Englands</hi> self destroying dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
uncureable! God hath in wonderful mercy
given us peace from forreign Enemies? And is
there no hope of prevailing with English
men to live together in peace? Must that of
<hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 36. be our case, to <hi>eat our own Flesh,
and be drunken with our own Blood as with sweet
Wine?</hi> Alas, no counsel, no petitions, no
tears, no experience, no judgments of God
by Plagues and Flames, have hitherto one
jot prevailed; But the Ulcer of mens minds
grows more and more putrid and malignant!</p>
            <p>Two ways are by some proposed: First
that all the Consciencious worshippers of
God in the Kingdom, should bring their
judgments to a full conformity, in every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
to their rulers: Whenas first they
cannot tell us who these must be: some say
to the King or Law? Some say to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
in a National Convocation: Others
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99576:21"/>
say, to the foresaid forreign universal Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
of General Councils, (with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs.)
If the first be the way, what King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
must it be in? Is it no where but in
<hi>Britain?</hi> Or also in <hi>France, Spain, Italy,
Germany, Poland?</hi> And must there be as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Religions as Kings and Laws will make?
And how far must this go? And where must
we stop? Must Kings choose us a God? Or
chuse whether we shall have any God, any
Christ, any Bible, any worship of God, and
so any Heaven?</p>
            <p>If it be the Bishops that must be the common
rule of our Religion, what Countreys and Ages
doth this rule serve for? Was it the rule where
Princes and Prelates were Arians, or Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
or Eutychians, or Monothelites, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists?
Is it the rule now in <hi>France, Spain, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
&amp;c.</hi> Or was it so in the Popes Catholick
Church, from <hi>An.</hi> 700 till the Reformation.</p>
            <p>If it be General Councils, I am weary of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
the Proofs that there never was one,
nor ever is like to be one, or ought to be. If it
be an <hi>European</hi> Council, who shall call them, and
who shall judge whether it be equal, and so
far General? And are not the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>European</hi> Bishops known Papists? And
will they not then be the Major Vote? And
so we must be as bad as they? And if the
rest of the Christian world be not bound by
them (in <hi>Greece, Ethiopia, Armenia, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
&amp;c.) Why are we? Is it the Council of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99576:22"/>
               <hi>Ariminum, Sirmium, Milane,</hi> &amp;c. or of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
2, Nice 2d</hi> many at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> at the
<hi>Laterane,</hi> at <hi>Lyons,</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> at <hi>Constance,</hi>
at <hi>Basil,</hi> at <hi>Trent,</hi> that are our Rule! Must
all that will be Catholicks and saved, hold all
the Heresies, Contradictions, and Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that Councils have held, and obey all
their load of Canons? If the <hi>Italians, French,
English,</hi> &amp;c. are all disagreed, how many and
which Councils we must obey, can all poor
people know which is in the right? And hath
Christ left Religion so uncertain a thing? Or
so mutable that General Councils of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
may be still increasing it? If he was the
the maker of it, by himself and his Apostles,
we may know more certainly where to find
it: Most Christians may say, <hi>Christ we know,</hi>
and <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c. we know: But
your Councils are too many, too voluminous,
too uncertain, for us to know. But if they
are such an absolutely necessary rule as you
pretend, why do not teachers preach them to
us daily as they do the Sacred Scriptures?</p>
            <p>If any would come down to confine these
universal Laws only to <hi>Things Indifferent,</hi> alas,
must the world be confounded and divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
things indifferent? Are not things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
variable as Countreys and Ages are?
And must the world have one Soveraignty
to make Laws for them? Cannot we have
Life, Liberty, Peace and Love without
things indifferent? Or without agreeing in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99576:22"/>
them. Are there any two in the whole
world, that are not ignorant, and that differ not
about many greater matters than things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different?
Doth he know himself, or know
what a man is, that thinks all tolerated
Christians must be so Skill'd in all things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
which men may impose, as to
know them to be such? When it is so hard to
teach the people things necessary, few and
plain? Alas, Lord, why must the Churches
be left in such hands?</p>
            <p>§ 9. But some have found out another
remedy for our divisions; and that is, That
only the Bishops shall be engaged to a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Jurisdiction, or profess the necessity of
obeying them, (under the name of a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Council, and in the intervals, of a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Bishops of the whole world, as
one Aristocracy;) And that this shall not be
imposed on any Lay-Communicants, but their
Consciences shall be left at liberty; Nor at
the first on the inferior Clergy, till they
are prepared to receive it: But only that
the People obey the Priests and Prelates,
and the Priests obey the Prelates and
all their Governing Officers, and the Prelates
only profess obedience to the <hi>Pretorian</hi>
Court called, <hi>The Catholick Church.</hi> Bishop
<hi>Gunnings Chaplain tells us that the Laity are not
required in order to Communion to declare for
General Councils.</hi> Whether they use the like
Moderation in <hi>France, Spain, Germany,</hi> I
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99576:23"/>
know not, <hi>viz. For the Bishops only to Profess
obedience to the Pope,</hi> and the <hi>Priests to the
Bishops, and the people to the Priests</hi> and <hi>Bishops.</hi>
I hear they go further.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And</hi> if Conventicles <hi>(as they will call them)</hi>
are also suppressed, we need not fear Religious Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
Murder and Ruine, (upon a feared Roman
Successour.) <hi>For saith the same</hi> Bishops Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,
<hi>pag</hi> 283. [For matters may be so ordered,
that all Officers, Ecclesiastical, Civil and Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
and all that are employed in Power or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of any kind, be persons both of known
Loyalty to the Crown, and yet faithful Sons of
the Church, and firm to the established Religion,
and the Laws that they act by may be so explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the favour of those that conform to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Worship, and the discouragement of all Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that we must reasonably be secure from all
violence that the Papists can offer to force our
submission: For when all our Bishops and Clergy
are under strict obligations and Oaths, and the
people are guided by them; and all Officers Civil
and Military are firm to the same interest, and
under severe penalties if they act any thing to the
contrary; Then what probable danger can there
be of any violence or disturbance to force us out of
our Religion, when all things are thus secured,
and the power of External Execution is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
in the hands of men of our own perswasion.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The Dr. says well: I am of his mind
in this: When they have subdued and cast
out all Dissenters (as they do in <hi>France)</hi> and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99576:23"/>
the Bishops and Clergy are setled under a
Forreign Church-Jurisdiction, and the People
setled in Obedience to them, and all Offices
Civil, Military and Ecclesiastick in their
hands, I do not think they need to fear that
the Papists will use violence to change their
Religion, whoever reigneth.</p>
            <p>But the Question is, whether this suppose
an <hi>Vnion</hi> with all in <hi>England</hi> that are now
against a Forreign Jurisdiction, or only the
<hi>destruction of them,</hi> or else the <hi>forcing them to
these terms?</hi> As to a <hi>destruction of them, or
forcing them to such terms,</hi> surely <hi>Violence</hi> must
do this. And what <hi>though the Subjects of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Power</hi> fear no <hi>Violence,</hi> are all the rest
(that is, the Protestants) of the Kingdom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable?
We suppose the old Church
of <hi>England,</hi> and all our Parliaments since the
Reformation, were against a Forreign Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction:
And will it be no loss to <hi>England</hi> to
destroy so many, that is, the Body of the
Land?</p>
            <p>But the Question is, Whether they may
not be thus brought to concord by consent?
I answer, no, unless you suppose them to be
men that indeed have no Religion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
can easily part with the bare name. For
they are sworn by the Oath of Supremacy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>all forreign Iurisdiction:</hi> And put the
case that the Pope and a Council, or the
King of <hi>France</hi> would bring the Emperours
or the Kings Army to serve him, and be at
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99576:24"/>
his Command, and he would only desire that
the General Officers and Colonels may be
engaged to obey him, and the Captains and
lower Officers to obey them, and the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to obey the Officers; but the common
Souldiers shall be bound to no more, than
this obedience to their Officers. Query,
Whether all these Souldiers be not Traitors
to the King or Emperour? <hi>Cromwells</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Souldiers took no Commissions against
King or Parliament; they did but obey their
Officers that pulled down both! And were
they therefore guiltless. Protestants will
not thus follow such Prelates, against their
Oaths, and against the known truth, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their duty to God and the King.</p>
            <p>§ 10. But though it be notorious that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
and Jurisdiction be the things which
cause the Papal <hi>Clergy</hi> to trouble and tear the
Christian world, what is it that makes the
<hi>Laity</hi> so mad, &amp; getteth this Clergy such a mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
crowd against their own Tranquillity and
Salvation? It's as visible as any moral thing, that
the Churches Divisions and Wars, and Miseries
have about a thousand years risen, from <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
thrusting such worldly, fleshly, unholy
men into holy Offices, who seek them but
to serve their Pride and Covetousness, and
Fleshly Appetites, and Ease, and who are
Enemies at the heart to the serious obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to Christ, which formally they preach.
Christs own Apostles in their time of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99576:24"/>
began to strive which of them should
be greatest; of which we have recorded his
sharp rebuke; which St. <hi>Peter</hi> himself did
after second, in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3. in words so
plain, that if his pretended Successours had
not first claimed a power (as the Church)
to be the determining expounders of all the
Bible, they had lain under the Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christ and <hi>Peter,</hi> Naked, without a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
or Cloak: But this <hi>Church-expounding
authority</hi> sets them above all the Word of
God, which is now but what they please to
make it, and an instrument to execute their
wills: And indeed it is now rather the Pope
and his Prelates and Councils than Christ,
that are the Law-makers to the Church:
For it is not he that maketh the <hi>words</hi> only
that makes the Law, but he that giveth them
their <hi>sense.</hi> The <hi>words</hi> are but as the <hi>body,</hi>
and the <hi>sense</hi> is the <hi>Soul</hi> of the Law. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial
Church now scorn the name of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
and being become <hi>Pretorian</hi> and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisterial,
they give Christ and his Spirit in
the Apostles leave to make the words and
body of the Scripture or Divine Law, as
God formed <hi>Adams</hi> body of the dust, so
that they may give it the breath of Life, and
also may make far more Voluminous Laws
of their own, and cut off and condemn all
the Children of God, that cannot believe that
it's lawful to obey them.</p>
            <p>And though the Ignorant think that the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99576:25"/>
claim of universal Legislation and Judgment,
in the universal Church and General Councils,
be no Service to the Domination of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Clergy men, no nor to any, seeing there
will never be a General Council,] They
understand not the <hi>mystery</hi> of <hi>iniquity,</hi> and
mistake. We have <hi>English Writers</hi> that have told
them, 1. That indeed <hi>Power is first given to
the body,</hi> (fine doctrine for <hi>Royalists)</hi> but <hi>by</hi>
the <hi>Body</hi> it is <hi>given to the Prelates to use for them.</hi>
2. That as a <hi>General Council</hi> hath the <hi>Supream
power,</hi> so the <hi>Prelates</hi> under them have the
Inferior Ruling power, and the executive in
the intervals of Councils: 3. That as Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
represent the Church in Soveraignty, so
every Bishop is by his office, the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative
of the Clergy of his Diocess, and
every Metropolitan the Representative of
his Province, and every Patriarch of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchate;
And then are not the Patriarchs
(at least with the Metropolitans,) Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Rulers in such Intervals? 4. And the Pope
is the Patriarch of the West, and hath a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
in the Church universal, and must be
confest to be <hi>principium unitatis Catholicae,</hi> and
say some, to be the President of Councils.
5. To which others add, that it <hi>belongs only
to the president to call Councils, and to Iudg
which are Lawful, without whose call they are
so far from binding us, that they are themselves
but unlawful Routs.</hi> And what would you
have more?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:99576:25"/>
But what's all this to the poor Priests?
What? Why, 7. The people know not what
the volumes of Councils say, and it is the
Priests (or no body) that must tell it them,
(both what their exposition of Scripture is,
and what their own additional Laws are)
without which they cannot be obeyed: so
that indeed the peoples Faith is ultimately
resolvedly into the authority of the Priest,
who tells them what the Bishop saith, who
tells them what the Metropolitan and his
Synod saith, who tells them what the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch
and his Synod saith, who tells them
what the chief Patriarch and a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
saith, who tell them determinatively
what Christ and the Scripture saith and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>But what's this to Councils when there
are none? Yes, 8. Those that are past and
gone, have left all those binding Laws by which
the present Bishops as an Aristocracy must
govern all the Christian World.</p>
            <p>But are not they for <hi>Monarchy in the state?</hi>
How come they then to plead for a <hi>Soveraign
Aristocracy</hi> over the Catholick Church, and
how come even the French Clergy to be for
the power of a Church Parliament above the
Pope? I cannot answer that; let the Pope and
they debate it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But I wonder that</hi> A. <hi>Bishop</hi> Laud <hi>should
be for the derivation of all power from the</hi>
Body, <hi>as</hi> Richard Hooker <hi>is: See Dr.</hi> Stillingfleets
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99576:26"/>
               <hi>Defence of him</hi> p. 544. 545. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> [No Body
collective, whensoever it assembled it self, did
ever give more power to the representing body of
it, than a binding power upon it self and all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars;
Nor ever did it give this power, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
than with this Reservation in nature, that
it would call again and reform, and if need were,
abrogate any law or ordinances upon just cause
made evident, that the representing Body had fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in trust or truth. And this power no Body
collective, Ecclesiastical or Civil, can put out of
it self, or give away to a Parliament or Council,
or call it what you will, that represents it—The
power which a Council hath to order, settle and
define differences arising concerning faith, it hath
not by any immediate institution of Christ, but
it was prudently taken up by the Church from the
Apostles example.] <hi>See Dr.</hi> Stillingfleets <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confess that the generality of Politicians
and Lawyers, Heathens, Papists and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
go much this way, as to Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and say that the <hi>Majestas persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>
is in the King or Senate, but the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestas
realis</hi> in the Body which giveth the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical
power, and on just cause may take it
away. It is no honour to be singular in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks,
and I have said enough of this else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<hi>(Christ. Direct. p. 1.)</hi> But if it be the
Body of the whole Church on Earth that
must give Church Officers and Councils their
power, and recal it when there is cause, if
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99576:26"/>
ever the whole Christian World meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to vote it, when it cometh to Poling,
we will give both the Monarchical and the
Aristocratical Conciliar Papists three for one,
to try who hath the power given by the Body.
But while two or three parts do already dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own
almost all their Councils, the case is decid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But if an <hi>old Councils</hi> Heresies, Errours or
Tyranny can be invalidated only by a <hi>new one</hi>
that is <hi>truly General,</hi> or a new one as <hi>Papal</hi> as
the last, we confess that <hi>Trent</hi> Canons are
like to be the Law, to the end of the
World.</p>
            <p>§ 11. But again, what is it that maketh so
many of the Laity serve the Popish Prelates
universal claim, or keep up the destructive
enmity and divisions of the Christian World?
A stranger would think that it were chiefly
caused by some great contrariety of real In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,
or that one party adhered to some
principles or practices, which were really
hurtful to the others rights? While both
were serious for Christianity. But it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by long experience notorious, that all
the Christian Worlds calamitous divisions
are principally from the old enmity between
the <hi>Womans</hi> and the <hi>Serpents Seed,</hi> and that all
is but the Prosecution of that which their
first Patriarch <hi>Cain</hi> began: exemplified after
in the discrimination of the Children of men
and the Sons of God, and in <hi>Esau</hi> and <hi>Iacob, Ish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi>
and <hi>Isaac,</hi> and so down to the days of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99576:27"/>
Apostles: And, saith <hi>Paul, As he that was
born after the flesh, persecuted him that was born
after the spirit; even so it is now.</hi> Among us it
is notorious, that if we knew how to cure
men of the radical Enmity of the flesh against
the spirit, and of a carnal minds averseness
to God and serious Godliness, the rest of
our differences were never like to continue
our Wounds and cruel Factions.</p>
            <p>In Families you may hear that this is the
fundamental difference. Husband and Wife,
Parents and Children, Master and Servants,
upon the meer account of serious Godliness,
do live like Enemies, that are impatient of
each other. If the Husband be ungodly, the
Wife, Children or Servants that have but
a care of their Salvation, are still under his
restraints, or frowns, or scorns: This praying
(especially if it be without Book) so much
preaching and hearing; yea any serious talk
of God, or Heaven, or Scripture, is a
troublesom weariness to him; and he tells
them, it is but Hypocrisie, or more ado than
needs: If any compassionately tell him of
the evil of his swearing, or tipling, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness,
he tells them they are precise
Puritanes or Fanaticks, and worse than he.
If they will needs hear Sermons, he will
have them go but to some cold or ignorant
Preacher, or one that will please him with
a calumny or scorn at Puritans, or that will
say as he doth, that this stir for Salvation,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99576:27"/>
and medling so much with Scripture and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
is but proud, self-conceited Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism.
In a word, it is serious Preaching, and
Hearing, and Reading Gods Word, serious
Praying, and Preparation for the Sacrament,
serious Discourse of the state of their Souls,
and Preparation for Death, Judgment and
Eternity, serious fearing and avoiding sin, and
speaking against the sin of others, that is the
common eye-sore and trouble of the world,
which they secretly hate, and cannot bear
with in their Families, in their Neighbours,
in Magistrates, in Ministers or People.</p>
            <p>And because it easeth their minds by vent,
and by keeping up some hopes that they
may be saved without this serious Godliness
themselves, they cherish a conceit that the
persons that herein differ from them are as
bad, if not much worse than others; and
gladly hear those that slander and deride
them: Such Company, such Pamphlets, such
Sermons please them. And to make them
odious, they have for them some contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
scornful Nickname; which, though it
be of no signification, is as effectual as the
truest charge. Among the Roman Sects, do
but call a man a Heretick, or Schismatick, a
Lutheran, a Calvinist, a Zwinglian; and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
do but call him a Sectary, a Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
a Puritan, a Calvinist, a Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist,
an Independant, a Presbyterian, a Round-head,
a Fanatick, a Whig, and it serveth the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99576:28"/>
turn as well as if you had proved him a proud
Hypocrite, or a Rebel. And there be among
the real Schismaticks also some persons, that
if you do but call a man Episcopal, a Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist,
an Arminian, a Church of <hi>England</hi> man,
that goeth to the Common-Prayer, they
think that he must needs be a Temporizer,
Graceless or Dangerously unsound.</p>
            <p>And thus the miseries of the Land are
continued and increased. But because the
spirit of <hi>Cain</hi> is the Grand Incendiary, and
the Enmity against <hi>serious Holiness</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all the world, is the principal cause of
Divisions, Hatred, Wars and Blood-shed, I
will here annex many Reasons which, with
men that have any Reason left them, should
cure this <hi>Malignant Enmity</hi> to <hi>Holiness,</hi> if
men will but soberly consider them.</p>
            <p>I have said so much to such already, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in my <hi>Saints Rest; Now or Never;</hi> my
<hi>Family Book;</hi> and a <hi>Saint</hi> or a <hi>Brute,</hi> that I
cannot do this work again without repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much that's said. But seeing all that
doth not serve, and the Ulcer breaketh out
more dangerously than ever, till it come to
a <hi>Noli me tangere,</hi> we must continue some
hope and use of means; and if we lay on
fresh Plaisters of the old materials, while
only New Books are by such regarded, we
are bound to do our best: It is but so much
labour lost; and it is not utterly lost to our
selves, while we have peace of Conscience
in Gods acceptance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:99576:28"/>
But being sure to be misreported when I
have done my best to be understood, that I
be not guilty of it, I will first shew what I
mean by <hi>serious Godliness,</hi> and next what I
mean by <hi>Malignity</hi> or <hi>Enmity</hi> to serious God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="2" type="chapter">
            <head>Chap. II. Whom I mean by Godly Persons,
and whom by Malignant Enemies to
Godliness.</head>
            <p>§ 1. BY GODLINESS I do not mean,
1. Any <hi>Superstition,</hi> or making Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
or Religious Duties which God never
made, and extolling <hi>these,</hi> and the Party that
are for them. God hath made us Religious
work enough: Could we do that well, we
need no more. Religion, so far as it is made
by men, is no <hi>Religion,</hi> but a <hi>contradiction</hi> or
<hi>equivocation;</hi> for <hi>Religion</hi> is our <hi>Obligation</hi> and
<hi>Duty to God,</hi> and Conscience of it. Could I
be for <hi>Superstition,</hi> or more Religion than
God hath made us, I might be for all the
New Religions of <hi>Rome,</hi> Franciscans, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans,
Carthusians, Jesuits, Oratorians, and
all the rest: And I might be for their Works
of Supererogation, their Massings, worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Bread, Angels, dead Saints, Images, their
Pilgrimages, Relicks, and all their pretended
Traditions and Councils, their new made
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99576:29"/>
Church-Laws; and I should know no
end.</p>
            <p>§ 2. And 2. By <hi>Godliness</hi> I mean not any
<hi>singular,</hi> odd Opinion differing from the
Scripture, and making a Sect, or any Errour
whatsoever; nor any Opinion which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to any thing which the whole Church
on Earth did ever hold as necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
or Communion.</p>
            <p>§ 3. Nor 3. Do I mean any <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Duty</hi>
of inferiour moment, which only makes to
the well-being of a Christian, though this be
an <hi>Inferiour part of Godliness;</hi> at least not that
which a godly willing person knows not to
be his duty.</p>
            <p>§ 4. Much less 4. Do I mean any proud
false conceit of a mans own Godliness, and
becoming one of an unwarrantable Sect, that
he may be conspicuous to others, or cherish
this presumption in himself; and say to
others, <hi>Stand by, I am holier than thou:</hi> Or as
the Pharisee, <hi>I thank thee Lord that I am not
as this Publican:</hi> (Though yet all that will
be saved must greatly differ from the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and must with thankfulness own Gods
grace.)</p>
            <p>§ 5. Nor 5. Do I mean any unlawful pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
which on the pretence of Godliness
may be done, whether unjust censures, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting,
unwarrantable separations from others,
divisions, disobedience to Authority, Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Rebellion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These are all contrary
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99576:29"/>
to Godliness and true Religion. Christ is the
strictest condemner of them, and Godliness
the best cure. If any Godly or Religious
person, be guilty of any one of these, 1. It
cannot be as known and in a predominant
degree; 2. And it is his Disease (as a Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
to a man) and not his Godliness.</p>
            <p>§ 6. <hi>But by GODLINESS I mean only
the</hi> serious Consent to, and Performance of
the Covenant which we made with God in
our Baptism: <hi>That we seriously believe
that</hi> there is One only God, of most perfect Power,
Knowledge and Goodness, our Creator, Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer,
Governour and End; whom we must
Obey, and Serve, and Love above all Creatures
whatsoever; and that he is the Rewarder of them
that diligently seek him, and will give everlasting
blessedness to the faithful, and everlastingly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
the ungodly. That we seriously believe that
Iesus Christ is the Redeemer and Saviour, who
Teacheth, Ruleth, Pardoneth, Sanctifieth and
Saveth all true penitent Believers; who is our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessor,
Head and Iudge. That we seriously be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that the Holy Ghost indited and sealed by
his Gifts and Miracles the Doctrine and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of the Prophets and Apostles, <hi>now record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Scriptures, and that he is sent
from the Father and the Son to Regenerate,
Sanctifie, Comfort and Strengthen those that
shall be saved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that we seriously consent to Love and
Obey God our Father, Saviour and Sanctifier as
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99576:30"/>
his Creatures, Subjects and Children in these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
that we may be pardoned and saved by
him. And that we be willing to forsake the
Devil and his Works, and the World and Flesh,
so far as they would tempt us to break this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
against God, and our Obedience and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And lastly,</hi> That we seriously or sincerely
<hi>(though not perfectly)</hi> endeavour in our lives
to keep this Covenant, preferring God in our
Love and Obedience, and our Hopes of Life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
before all the pleasures and treasures of
this World, and resisting the temptations of the
Devil, World and Flesh, which would turn us
from him, and from our Obedience and Hope:
And that we truly <hi>(though not perfectly)</hi> trust
God and our Redeemer for the Heavenly Glory
which he hath promised.</p>
            <p>This is plainly, distinctly and fully what I
mean by <hi>Godliness</hi> or <hi>Holiness:</hi> And such are
the persons (though all imperfect, and of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
degrees) which I call <hi>Saints</hi> or <hi>Godly:</hi>
He that feigneth me to mean any thing else,
doth but abuse himself and me: If there be
none such, there are no Christians, and all
the Word of God is vain.</p>
            <p>But every Duty commanded by God is a
part of the matter of our Obedience and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<hi>viz.</hi> As according to the first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
to take God for our God, to be
absolutely Obeyed, Loved and Trusted, and
to renounce all Idols, and neither to <hi>Obey,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99576:30"/>
Love or Trust our selves or any creature before
him;</hi> So also according to the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
to renounce all scandalous symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing
with Idolaters, in the outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God in their sinful way; especially
by Images, and other apearances of Idolatry:
And that we worship God, according to his
Word.</p>
            <p>And according to the third Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that we avoid all Prophanation of holy
things; All Perjury, false Vows, and father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
falshoods upon God or his Words, and
rash Swearing and Unreverent using of Gods
Name, and turning his worship into a life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
form.</p>
            <p>And according to the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that we worship God publickly in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
assemblies, and devote the Lords day to
holy exercises; that we search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
pray for what God hath promised, or
commanded; Meditate and Confer of holy
things, and celebrate the Sacraments in the
Communion of Saints.</p>
            <p>And so according to the second Table that
we honour and obey our Parents, and (as far
as their right of Government reacheth) all
other that God sets over us: And dishonour
them not, nor obey Civil, Ecclesiastical or
Domestical Usurpers against them.</p>
            <p>That we do our best to save our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
Life and Bodily welfare, against Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers
or Usurpers; and hurt no mans life or
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99576:31"/>
health either violently or by <hi>Iezabels</hi> pretence
of Justice.</p>
            <p>That we keep our Senses, Thoughs, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
Passions and Actions, from all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chastity
and immodest lasciviousness.</p>
            <p>That we wrong no man in his estate, but
to our power help them.</p>
            <p>That we avoid all Injustice, Lying, false
Witness, false Judgment and Oppressive, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
Government; And promote Truth
and Justice to our power.</p>
            <p>And lastly that we love our Neighbour
as our selves, and take his <hi>welfare</hi> and his <hi>suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>
as our own, and do as we would have
others do by us, and covet not to draw from
him to our selves.</p>
            <p>So that he that pretendeth to love God
and Godliness, and obedience to Christ,
and yet loveth not such a life as this, he lieth,
or says he knows not what.</p>
            <p>And he that hateth men or opposeth them,
for any one of all these duties, (for reading or
hearing Gods Word, for praying for things
promised, for holy Conference and Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for sanctifying the Lords day, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
a Shepherd and not a Wolf; for ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring
prophaneness, and other great sins)
doth thereby declare that it is so much of
Godliness or Obedience which he abhorreth;
and it is through Ignorance doubtless if he
seriously love and practise the rest of Gods
Commands.</p>

§ 7. II. By <hi>Malignant Enemies of Godliness,</hi>
1. I do not mean every one that hath any
backwardness to any duty, which he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
in the practice: Nor every one that
is guilty of some omissions: The spirit is
willing, and the flesh is weak.</p>
            <p>§ 8. 2. I mean not those that are Godly in
the main so far as they can know, but through
education or otherwise are ignorant of some
Integral Truths or Duties, and have an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
contentious Zeal against them by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake;
and by factious company are taught
therefore to speak evil falsly of those from
whom they differ. I hear some revile all
even with terms of enmity and unchristian
threatnings, yea seeking their ruine, who do
not swear, say and practise all that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to English Conformity. I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
them therefore Malignant Enemies of
Godliness, if they live <hi>soberly, righteously</hi> and
<hi>godlily</hi> in their way, and prefer God before
Men, Heaven before Earth, the Soul before
the Body, and a Holy life before the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and profits of the flesh. If they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
against all that are not for Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sans,
Lay-Chancellours Excommunications,
Symbolical Crossing of Children as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting
sign of Christianity, and all the rest;
I wish them more Charity, but I call them
not <hi>Malignant Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I find Bishop <hi>Gunnings</hi> Chaplain thinks that
he doth <hi>say well,</hi> when he saith, that <q>
                  <hi>[Not
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99576:32"/>
only Murderers, Adulterers, Drunkards, but such
Schismaticks as disturb the peace, and weaken
the authority of the Churches Discipline</hi> (theirs)
<hi>are to be excommunicated and reckoned among
Heathens and Publicans; and Enemies to the
Gospel of Christ</hi> (if they preach it without a
Diocesanes license.) p. 214. <hi>And that it is
already our case, that it's a very difficult mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to find a Iury and Witnesses especially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Dissenters, upon whose credit we may
rely.)</hi>
               </q> All this signifieth how little blind
Faction is to be believed, and how far it
conquereth even humane modesty and vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city:
But yet I difference it from the <hi>Enmity</hi>
to <hi>Godliness</hi> which I speak of. And that you
may see that he is no Papist, though for a
<hi>Forreign Iurisdiction,</hi> he tells you of <hi>Cromwell</hi>
that <hi>[There is too great, reason to suspect that
he intended to settle Popery in the Nation, when
matters had been ripe to go through with it.]</hi>
I confess this is news to me: I have roundly
told him to his face of his Disloyalty in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
our <hi>English</hi> Monarchy, and told the
world then of his treacherous Usurpation,
but it never came into my thoughts that he
intended to <hi>settle Popery in the Nation.</hi> But
if these words come from Clergy Truth and
Modesty, they are very considerable. I hope
the old Royalists will be against Popery the
more if <hi>Cromwel</hi> was for it: And the Papists
I hope will be no more angry with Dr. <hi>Moulin</hi>
that answereth <hi>Philanax Anglicus,</hi> for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99576:32"/>
the Kings death to be caused and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
by the Papists, if <hi>Cromwel</hi> was for
them. But Faction will face men down, that
Snow is black.</p>
            <p>So on the other side, I hear some that are
against Infant Baptism, sharply censure all
that are not of their mind; And some over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sharply
censure the Prelatists and Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists;
And almost all the Christian world
is divided into parties, that too little stick at
the injurious censuring of others; The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
Greeks, Abassines, Armenians, Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
Jacobites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And among the Papists,
the Dominicans and Molinists, and Janse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And among the Protestants, too
many. This is no small sin, but it is not
that enmity to Godliness it self which I
mean.</p>
            <p>§ 9. 3. And I mean not by <hi>malignity,</hi> mens
<hi>Differences</hi> in <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Political Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies.</hi>
Though I take Popery to be half a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Controversy, and to be unsufferable by
such Princes and People whom they bind
themselves to depose and destroy: And that
to Subject all the Christian world to the
Legislative, Judicial and Executive Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of one Pope, or one <hi>Pretorian Court,</hi>
is no better than to proclaim such a Pope or
Court, to be publick enemies and usurpers
to all Christian Princes and States. But yet
abundance of Political differences may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
with serious Piety: My reason is, because
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99576:33"/>
God hath not made Political Controversies
so clear as that all good Christians can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
them. Neither the Light of Nature,
nor the Bible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor Tradition endeth them.
Nor hath he put them into our Creed or the
ten Commandments, nor laid mens Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on them, as he hath done on the Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials
of Religion: Nor commanded all men
to be so well Skill'd in Statute Books and
Common Law as to be able to know which
party is in the right. And therefore I joyn
not with those Clergy or Lay-Gentlemen,
who damn all that are not of their mind and
side, in differences of that nature.</p>
            <p>I often hear some say that Kings and States
do all receive their Authority from the
Body of the Nation who are the chief seat of
it. So <hi>Hooker,</hi> so <hi>Laud,</hi> and indeed as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
so Heathen, Papist and Protestant Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
ordinarily hold: I call not all these <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants,</hi>
though I am fully satisfied, 1. That
God is the Instituter of Magistracy <hi>in genere.</hi>
2. And that he hath so far specified it as to
determine of its unchangeable Essentials
(that they shall as his Officers promote o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to the ten Commandments.)
3. And that he never gave this governing
power to the people. 4. But that all that the
people do is, 1. To specify it as to the number
of persons (a Monarchy, Aristocracy or, mixt
of these and some Democracy.) 2. To li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it by determining of the Degrees of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99576:33"/>
power, about Property and Liberty, and all
things which Gods Law hath left undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
and mutable. 3. And to determine
of the persons and Families that shall receive
the immutable power from God and the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
from men.</p>
            <p>I often hear some most magnify Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and some Aristocracy, and some Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
and some a mixture; and some <hi>English</hi>
Clergy men are for a Civil Monarchy Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to a Catholick Clergy-Aristocracy:
I call none <hi>Malignants</hi> for any such diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</p>
            <p>I find some Papists and Protestants Politick
writers saying that when it proveth hurtful
to the Common-wealth, the people may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
the power given the Prince, and change
the Government, and <hi>Hooker</hi> saith, <hi>No doubt
in such a case a Prince will part with it:</hi> And
A. Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> before cited, saith of the
like, and abrogating Laws, <hi>This power no Body
Collective Ecclesiastical or Civil, can put out of it
self and give away,</hi> And I find many that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol
<hi>Hooker</hi> and <hi>Laud,</hi> call this a principle of
Rebellion. It is neither of them that I call
<hi>Malignants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I find most writers of Politicks agreed that
the Law of nature Alloweth and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Kingdoms and Commonwealths <hi>self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
against any publick Enemies that seek to
destroy them.</hi> And that no man on pretence
of Right to a Crown hath any right to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99576:34"/>
the body of the people, or the <hi>Bonum
publicum</hi> which is the Essentiating end of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
nor can be <hi>simul rex &amp; publicus
hostis.</hi> I hear others take this for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
doctrine of Rebellion, and say, that
if a King would destroy all the people of a
Kingdom (in revenge, or in siding with
another Kingdom of his own or anothers,)
they ought not to resist him, or any that he
Commissioneth to do it: And that if he
should Commission a few men to kill all the
Parliament as they sit, or to burn the City,
it is Rebellion to resist by self-defence. I
hear Lawyers themselves at great difference
on such matters, some for more power, and
some for less: I find the great Defenders of
Monarchy, such as <hi>Barclay</hi> and <hi>Grotius de Iure
Belli,</hi> naming many cases in which Kings may
be resisted, yea and forfeit all: And I find o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
among us of a contrary mind. Yea I
find the <hi>Conformable</hi> and <hi>Diocesane</hi> Pillars
quite differ in such cases, Bishop <hi>Bilson</hi> naming
many cases in which resistance is no rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>(To Subject his Kingdom to a Forreign
Realm, or to change the form of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
from Impery to Tyranny, or neglect the
Laws Established by common consent of Prince
and People, to execute his own pleasure; In these
and other such cases which might be named, if
the Nobles and Commons joyn together to defend
their ancient and accustomed Liberty, Regiment &amp;
Laws, they may not well be counted Rebels,</hi> saith
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99576:34"/>
he, <hi>of Obedience,</hi> pag. 520.) But I hear many
now say the contrary, and Condemn such
Doctrine as disloyal.</p>
            <p>I find some joyn with the Papists in accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Reformation as caused by Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in <hi>Germany, Geneva, France, Belgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
&amp;c. And I find Bishop <hi>Iewel, Bilson,</hi> and
other Bishops defending the <hi>French</hi> defence,
and Dr. <hi>Peter Moulin</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in his
answer to <hi>Philanax Anglicus,</hi> Contradicting
their accusers, as false in Point of History.</p>
            <p>Abundance of such Political Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
are now lately agitated, some charging
their adversaries with Rebellion, and some
with Tyranny: Some saying, they are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Treason against the King; and others,
They are Traitors against the Kingdom:
And too ordinarily damning one another; as
if these matters were Articles of our Creed.</p>
            <p>What a dismal difference is there now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
those words in the Declaration in the
Corporation Act; <hi>[There is no Obligation on
me or any other person, from the Oath called the
solemn League and Covenant: Some say there
are none but Rebels will refuse it; And that if
any obligation had been granted to things law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
or necessary some would have extended it to
Rebellion or Schism.</hi> And therefore all Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
is to be renounced. Others say, that
National perjury is a forerunner of Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Calamity or ruine; and that where
Oaths bind not, there can be no Trust; and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:99576:35"/>
no Trust, no Commerce: And they think as
Dr. <hi>Sanderson,</hi> and Casuists, Papists and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
do, that though an Oath or Vow be
unlawfully Imposed and Sinfully taken, and
part of the matter of it be unlawful, and
the Imposers and Takers are bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and no one is bound by it to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
part, yet the taker is bound to that
part of the matter which is lawful or neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary:
And they take it to be lawful and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to <hi>Repent of sin,</hi> to <hi>oppose Prophaneness,
Schisms, Heresy and Popery, to defend the King,</hi>
and therefore that it obligeth them to these.</p>
            <p>I meddle not with the Roman opinion
that it is the Henrician Heresy to say that
Kings have a power of investing Bishops,
and disobeying the Popes Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and of such as Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> that dare
not question or deny the power of the Pope
and Councils to Excommunicate and depose
Kings, because then they must condemn ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
General Councils, which are their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
itself, and (saith he) must grant that
the Pope is Antichrist, and the Church
erroneous that hath so long used this.</p>
            <p>I name all these Political Controversies,
1. To tell you that it is not factious
and passionate enmity to each other on
such accounts, which I mean by enmity to
Religion.</p>
            <p>2. And to remember men, that if in so
many and great points of Politicks and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99576:35"/>
the Learned and Christian World,
have so great difference, what reason is there
that we should Damn or Excommunicate, or
hate each other about a hard opinion in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
or a Ceremony.</p>
            <p>3. And to tell the Popish Church, that if
it were a good argument that there must be
one Pretorian Court or Church, to oblige
all the World by an universal determination
in what sence to expound the Scripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is abused to errour by mens mistake,
and there must be an end of Controversies; by
the same reason there must be an universal
Pretorian Court to expound all human Laws,
and end the controversies of Lawyers; Yea
and to master all mens Reason; for Scripture
is no more commonly controverted and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
than Law is; And not half so much as
<hi>Reason</hi> is, which is pleaded for almost all the
falshood and wickedness in the World.</p>
            <p>§ 10. Moreover it is not personal feuds
between Man and Man that I mean by <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi>
to Godliness: No though any such be
against an Innocent and Godly Man, where
it is not for his Godliness, but some other
difference.</p>
            <p>§ 11. I will say more though some dislike
it, it is not a Papist as such that I mean
by a <hi>Malignant</hi> Enemy of Godliness; I know
that Education, and Temptation, and want
of hearing the confutation of their errours
judiciously made, may cause Godly persons
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99576:36"/>
to think that the universal Church must be
united in some humane Head or Soveraign
power; and that there is no other way to
end controversies and schisms, and that (as
Dr. <hi>Saywell</hi> saith) there must be some over
Kingdoms or National Churches, as well
as over particular persons, that many may
not escape while a few are punished: It is
easy to be deceived by the pretences of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Concord, while men see the divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and discords of others: And the false
pretences of Antiquity are so confidently
uttered by their Clergy, that men unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the history may verily believe
them: And the plea for an uninterrupted suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of Ministerial ordination, and that a
Superior must give power to the Inferiors,
deceiveth many. If there must be a Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sane
to ordain and rule all Presbyters, and a
Metropolitan to ordain or rule the Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanes,
and a Patriarch to rule them, from
whom shall the Patriarchs receive their
power, or commands, but from a Pope?
The poor reasoning which the French now
use with the Protestants puzleth unskilful
persons; <hi>viz. Was there any Church before
your reformation? If yea, where was it? And
had not you your Ministerial power from it? It
was</hi> Rome <hi>or none: And if it was the true
Church then, it is so now.</hi> We answer them,
there was and is one only Catholick Church:
Of this Christ only is the Head or Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:99576:36"/>
governour, and no man or men; Of
this all Lawful Pastors are his official guides
in their several Provinces, as many Justices
and Mayors of Corporations under one
King: That all these having one King (Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus)
and one Law (of Christ) and one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and one Faith and Hope, are to keep
the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace,
and to use Synods when needful to that end,
but not as a Pretorian or Regent Aristocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
or Court. That the Church before <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
was all over the World where ever
there were Christians: in <hi>Ethiopia, Egypt,
Syria, Armenia, Georgia, Circassia, Asia,</hi> and
where ever the Greek Christianity is, in
<hi>Moscovy,</hi> and in all <hi>Europe</hi> where there were
true Christians. That the envious man hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sowed Tares, this Church is unhappily
fallen into many corruptions, diseases, and
factious sects, almost all censuring one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
no part of it is perfect: That the Papal
part is in Doctrine, Worship and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
one of the most corrupted parts! Yet
so far as their diseases or errours nullify not
their profession of Christianity, they are
parts, though leprous. And therefore though
they are the most uncharitable and schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
part, as they cut off or unchurch all
the Christian World save themselves, yet
being as <hi>Christians</hi> united to the rest in the
common faith, their Baptism &amp; Ordinations
are not nullities as they invest men in the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:99576:37"/>
Christian Society and Christian Ministry;
though that part of them is a nullity which
engageth men in a schism and in sin. That
the Ministerial power is not the gift of Man,
but only of Christ, who by the Charter of
his recorded Word, giveth the power and
the obligation to that person who is duely
chosen and called thereto: As the Kings
Charter giveth the power to the Mayor of
a Corporation duly qualified and chosen:
that the ordainers are but partly Judges of
due qualification, and partly Ministerial In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vesters,
and not at all the Donors of the
Power: that ordination is for order sake
needful, when it may be had to keep men
from being Judgers of their own sufficiency:
But <hi>order</hi> being only for the <hi>thing ordered,</hi>
(as the Sabbath was made for man, and not
man for the Sabbath) is not necessary against
the end. That there is no necessity that a
Superior must ordain: but as the Colledge
of Physicians, Philosophers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> make Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians,
Philosophers as approved, so may
equals in the Ministry: Do not Bishops
make or consecrate Bishops. If this were
not so, who makes the Pope? If he did not
pretend that his power is given him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
from Christ, he must grant that there
are some men above him to give it him,
and so he is not the Soveraign. If they
say that the power of Popes (and Kings)
is given by the whole body (the Church)
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99576:37"/>
he is then no Pope: for it's known that three
parts of the Christian World are against
him. If he will say, None are the Church
but those that are his party, any sect or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
may say the like, and appropriate au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to themselves.</p>
            <p>Nothing more cheateth the ignorant,
than ambiguous words, and confusion: And
explaining those words, and needful plain
distinction, would save the writing of many
volumes, and would make truth easily meet
the seeker, and unravel all the spider Webs
of deceivers.</p>
            <p>Do but well use these few distinctions and
all Popery vanisheth into smoak. 1. Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
between a Catholick Church as headed
by Christ; (This we are all members of;)
and a pretended Catholick Church, headed
by the Pope or any men: This is another
Church as to the denominating form, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
another informing, unifying head: And
this is it which we deny.</p>
            <p>2. Distinguish visibility: Christs Church
is so far visible as to have a Head who was
visible on Earth, is visible in Heaven, and
will visibly come to Judgment, and visibly
reign for ever. It hath visible Laws, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
and Officers; The subjects bodies and
their profession are visible; And it is no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
visible; no not as to the <hi>Souls</hi> or <hi>real
faith</hi> of the subjects. The Papists Church
hath an Usurping Visible Humane Head on
earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:99576:38"/>
3. Distinguish of Baptism and Ordination
as into Christs Catholick Church, and done
by Papists as Christians; And as into the
Popes Catholick Church and done by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
as Papists.</p>
            <p>4. Distinguish of <hi>Subjection,</hi> and <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:</hi>
We owe Communion when we owe
no Subjection, and where men have no right
to be our Governours.</p>
            <p>5. Distinguish between Communion in
Christianity, and that in Essentials, Integrals
or Accidents; and Communion in errours
and corruptions, or defects. We have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with Papists and all Christians in
Christianity, (if they be Christians indeed:)
But we renounce Communion in the errours
and sins of them and all others, as far as we
are able to avoid them. All Christians have
Union and Communion in the Essentials of
Christianity: No Christians have Union
and Communion in all the Integrals (on
Earth) all being imperfect: But the more
such Union and Communion, the better. No
Christians have, or ought to have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in all the Accidents. All should avoid
Communion in sin.</p>
            <p>6. Distinguish between Communion of
Hearts, Communion of Profession, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
in Local presence: We have Heart
Communion in one Essential Faith, Hope
and Love with all true Christians on Earth.
We <hi>profess</hi> all one Faith in the Essentials:
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:99576:38"/>
We have nearer Communion, or fuller with
the Reformed Churches which are soundest
in the Integrals, than we have with the
more faulty and corrupt. But we have Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
presence but in one place at once; and
we ought to avoid Local presence where
we cannot have it without sin, though we
have Communion in Faith, Love and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
with the same men. If a Reformed
Church will not admit our Local presence
without subscribing some one untruth, we
must be absent, when we may be present
with a worse Church which excludeth us
not by any such Imposition.</p>
            <p>7. Accordingly distinguish of Separation:
We separate not at all from <hi>Union</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
with Papists as they are Christians,
or as they hold any Truth: But 1. We
separate from <hi>Subjection</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> to
them, which we never owed them, or any
other Church. 2. We separate from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with their Church, as it is a Policy
informed by an Usurping Humane King or
Head. 3. We separate from all their sins so
far as we know them. 4. We deny Local
presence in their Mass-worship, because of
the sin imposed on us, both before it, and in
it. 5. We are uncapable of Communion in
all accidents, or mutable indifferent things.</p>
            <p>Understand and use well these few plain
distinctions, and you need little more to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
all the Papists.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:99576:39"/>
And I fear not to add, that were the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
in my power (as I never did) I never
would use any inhumanity or cruelty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them; yea, I would use no <hi>Offensive,</hi>
but only <hi>Defensive</hi> force against them; nor
hurt one of them, further than they made
it necessary for the Defence of the Land, or
those whom they would hurt.</p>
            <p>I knew not till a Book called <hi>The Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of England</hi> lately told me, how many
very severe Laws are against them. I am no
Judge of the times that they were made in,
nor of their occasions: But I think that of
late they have <hi>done more hurt</hi> than good: For
1. Some of them seem too severe. 2. Some
I cannot prove to be justifiable; <hi>viz.</hi> Those
which would compel them to come to our
Sacramental Communion, when many a
good Minister would not receive them if
they came: And that which excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth
them that never were of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion:
And that which layeth the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
as such in prison, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. It greatly
tendeth to misinform Forreigners, who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these Laws, think they are all put in
Execution; and so believe those that tell
them, that the Catholicks here are under
constant Cruelties, and frequent Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms;
whenas I never in all my life knew
of one Papist that suffered so much for his
Religion, as I have done my self, within
these few years past, though my sufferings
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:99576:39"/>
are so small as to be no meet matter of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great complaint. 4. These Laws being
a continual danger to them (should there be
Governours that would execute them) doth
put them on continual plotting and striving
against them. Sufferings, or great dangers,
put men by fear upon self-defence, and the
utmost endeavours for deliverance, who
would be more quiet if they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in safety; and though their Clergy
would be still plotting the recovery of the
Papal power, to subject King and Kingdom
to the Sacred King of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet the Laity
would be less against the common Peace,
when they found that it was their own Peace.</p>
            <p>§ 12. I have told you what I mean not
by <hi>Malignant Enmity to Godliness;</hi> I tell you
now what I mean by it; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the blindness and ungodliness of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Nature, increased by practice into Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine
Enmity, and turning mens hearts by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
and disaffection from God and Heaven,
doth possess them with a deep dislike of a holy,
heavenly and spiritual life; first as to their own
practices, and then as it is in others; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is against their worldly hopes and fleshly
lusts, they hate it, and reject it themselves, and
then hate and maliciously oppose it in others;
yea though Law, Custom, and worldly Interest
draw them formally to profess Christianity and
Obedience to Gods Laws, and to Vow that in
Baptism, they hate the serious performance of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:99576:40"/>
their own Profession and Vows; and would be
glad to drive it out of the world, and to set up
Hypocrisie and Ceremony, or a Stage Religion
and Mummery, or the toothless Mass and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities
in its stead: And if custom or shame
hinder them from persecuting or scorning Truth
and Godliness in its proper name, they will shew
their mind by these things following.</p>
            <p>1. They will set up some worldly, fleshly
Interest (like the Papal Kingdom) which is
contrary to the Christian and holy Interest;
and then they will persecute <hi>Christians</hi> not
<hi>as Christians,</hi> nor <hi>as Godly</hi> in name, but as
such indeed by pleading Conscience and
Obedience to God, against their inconsistent
interest and ways.</p>
            <p>2. Among all that are against their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
false interest, they will cull out the more
serious godly persons to afflict.</p>
            <p>3. Among all the faithful, they will cull
out those who do Christ most service in the
world; because Christs service is it that is
their disservice, and opposite to their sin.</p>
            <p>4. They will make a scorn of their very
Religious duties, and take up mimical deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
to make them seem ridiculous or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible.</p>
            <p>5. When they can charge them with no
crimes, they will purposely make Nets to
catch them, as the Enemies of <hi>Daniel</hi> did by
him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. And as the Spider makes her
curious Webs to catch and kill the Flies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:99576:40"/>
6. Yea they will <hi>make faults</hi> by slander,
and lies, if not by perjuries, if they can find
none.</p>
            <p>7. Yea their virtue, piety and innocency
shall be all called Hypocrisie; and when
they cannot accuse their actions, they will
accuse their hearts and secret thoughts, and
judge them as if they had a Casement into
their breasts.</p>
            <p>8. Yea if their innocency cannot be so
stained, they will hate them so much the
more, because they cannot tread down their
reputation.</p>
            <p>9. They will search after, and aggravate
all the failings of Religious people, and turn
them into crimes.</p>
            <p>10. If any one of them, or an Hypocrite,
that's like them, be guilty of any notable
fall, they will perswade men that all the rest
of their lives is like that crime; yea and
that all that profess much seriousness in God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
are as bad as they; that all the rest of
the life of <hi>Noah, Lot, David, Solomon, &amp;c.</hi>
were as bad as the criminal part; and that
all the Servants of Christ are <hi>Peter</hi>'s, or
<hi>Iudas</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>11. That it is not their sins, but their pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which they hate, you will see in that
they live in far greater sin themselves, and
take it to be no great harm, but hate those
that reprove them.</p>
            <p>12. And they make light of the common
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:99576:41"/>
crimes of others. They can bear with an
Atheist, an Infidel, a Drunkard, a prophane
Swearer, a derider of Godliness, yea a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutor,
a Fornicator, a man of no Religion,
if he will but be for them, and serve their
interest, and will not scruple Communion
with such: But men never so sober, just and
godly, that cross their wills and carnal ways,
they cannot endure: And if they be such
Clergy-men, as the world hath too many,
such serious Godly men, for disliking their
ungodliness, are made the common objects
of their Pulpit and discoursing scorn or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations,
and perhaps are excommunicate
<hi>ipso facto,</hi> for dissenting from their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
or Wills.</p>
            <p>13. Such usually in former ages have been
the chief Instigators of Princes and Rulers,
to hate men of serious Religion, and to stir
up Persecution against them, and to render
such odious to the world as Hereticks or
intolerable Villains. O what difference is
there between the true narratives of the
Lives of <hi>Luther, Calvin, Beza,</hi> and abundance
such, and the odious lies and defamations
written of them by some others. Yea, those
who commend <hi>Melancthon, Bucer,</hi> and many
such for Learning and Moderation, hate their
Doctrine of Reformation and serious Piety.</p>
            <p>14. And you may note, that in any slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of a Godly man, they will sooner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
one or two ignorant malicious Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:99576:41"/>
against them, that never knew them,
than the testimonies of hundreds of most
faithful persons who praise and vindicate
them, though they better knew them.</p>
            <p>15. They seldom give the accused leave
to speak for themselves before they believe
Accusations against them; but conclude that
they are as bad as back-biting malice report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them behind their backs.</p>
            <p>16. They are glad to hear of any infamy
of Religious persons, and loth to hear them
praised without contradiction; and are glad
to hear of any suffering which befals them.</p>
            <p>17. If there be any publick differences in
a Church, City or Land, they are usually
against that side, which most favoureth se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Godliness, be they who they will. If
the King, Parliament, and Bishops will be
for the persons and ways of soberness, justice
and serious Godliness, they would be on the
other side. And they will cry up any that
will cry them down, or would oppress
them.</p>
            <p>18. Lastly, The quality of the Enemies
may help with the rest to tell what it is
that they are against: when it is the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of worldlings, proud, ambitious men,
sensual drunkards, gluttons, fornicators, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
and irreligious, who hate Godliness
so far, as to drive it from themselves and
families, and rather venture on Hell fire,
than be truly godly; it's easie to know what
these hate in others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:99576:42"/>
I have told you who I mean by <hi>Malignant
Enemies of Godliness,</hi> that the mistakers and
slanderers of my words may have no excuse.
Could we now but prevail against this
Cainism, or Devilism, it would do much to
recover the Peace of many Nations of the
Earth: But Christ hath told us, that this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
between the seed of the Woman and
the Serpent, of which <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> were
the first specimen since the Fall, will never
cease till Christ come, as is terribly descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 6, 10, 11, 12. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.
But yet some <hi>Sauls</hi> may become <hi>Pauls,</hi> and
for the hope of the recovery of such, I will
adjoyn such Reasons as should convince any
that have the use of Reason left.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="3" type="chapter">
            <head>Chap. III. Undeniable Reasons against
Malignant Enmity to serious Godliness.</head>
            <p>1. TO deny that there is a God who is
the Supreme Governour of Man, is
to be mad in despight of the whole world
which proveth it: And it deposeth all Kings,
who claim their Authority as given them by
God, and as his Officers; for if there be no
God, there's none to give them Authority:
And to grant that there is a God, and yet
deny him our love, honour and obedience, is
to speak gross contradiction, or else profess
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:99576:42"/>
open malice against God himself. If he be
God, he is perfectly <hi>Wise;</hi> and should not
perfect Wisdom govern us? If he be God,
he is perfectly <hi>Good,</hi> and mans chief Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor;
and should he not then have our
chiefest Love? If he be God, he is of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Power; and should he not then be
obeyed? If he be God, he made us, and still
maintaineth us, and we live continually by
his will, and have all that we have of his
bounty; and we, and all we have are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his own; and is not then all our thanks
and service due to him? If he be God, he is
our Judge, and will be just in punishing and
rewarding; and should we not then serve
him with the greatest fear, and with the
highest hopes? These things are undeniable.</p>
            <p>Dare any man that believeth there is a
God, say, that man can Love him too much?
or too much honour him, or obey him? Can
we return him more than his due? It is
therefore no less than practical Atheism, or
else a rebellious defiance of God, to blame
or hate men, for loving, honouring and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him to the very utmost of their power.
And to deny God, or defie him, is a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
fold more damnable sin and treason,
than to deny and defie the King, or your
own Parents.</p>
            <p>2. God hath himself commanded man,
to Love him with all his heart, and soul,
and might; and to obey him with his
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:99576:43"/>
greatest fidelity and diligence, and to fear
him more than any creature, and to place
our chiefest hopes on his promised rewards,
and to seek first his Kingdom and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
and not to sin wilfully to save our
lives, or gain all the world, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 5, 6, 7.
&amp; 10. 12. &amp; 11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>Mat. 22. 37. Heb.
11. 6. 1 Cor. 15. 58. Luke 12. 4. Heb. 12. 28, 29.
Mat.</hi> 10. 39, 42. &amp; 16. 25, 26. &amp; 6. 33. <hi>Luke
14. 26, 33. Mat.</hi> 5. 19, 20. And the Law of
Nature speaks no less. And if God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
it, and you condemn it, do you not
condemn God? If you command your Son,
or Servant, or Subject any thing, he that
blames him for obeying you, blames you
more than him. If it be a fault of folly to
love and serve God with all our heart, and
mind, and might, the fault or folly would be
Gods that requireth it, and not ours. And,
is such a blasphemer meet for humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
who will accuse his Maker? If God
be blame-worthy, he is not perfect: And if
he be not perfect, he is not God: And so
to be against our utmost obedience, doth
amount to no less than Blasphemy or
Atheism.</p>
            <p>3. Do you think that Man is a creature
that needs to be blamed for loving or obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God too much? Do you not know that
Nature is vitiated by sin, and Man is now
backward to God, and all that's good and
holy? You may as well blame a lame man
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:99576:43"/>
for running too fast, as a sinful man for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
God too much. It's more foolish
than to blame a sick man for working or
eating too much that can do neither? Or to
hold a man in a Consumption from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the Hill too fast? Do you find your
own hearts so forward to a holy life, as that
you need pulling back or hinderance, when
no exhortation or necessity will perswade
you to it? And if you need no such reproof
or stop, why should you think others need
it? Do you not use to say that all men are
sinners? And do sinners need to be blamed
for obedience? Do you not daily confess
that you have done the things which you
ought not to have done, and left undone the
things that you ought to have done, and
there is no health in you; And yet will you
blame men for too much Obedience? It
seems then that your Confessions of sin are
Professions of it; and while you tell what
you have done, you do but tell what you
mean to do, and what you would have all
others do: or else you blame your selves for
sinning, and hate your Neighbours for not
sinning.</p>
            <p>4. If you hate men for holiness and avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sin, you hate Jesus Christ most: for he
was most holy, and free from all sin: And
you hate the Angels and all in Heaven, for
they are holy and void of all transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:99576:44"/>
5. Have you any better Master to serve
than God? or any better work to do than
he commandeth, or any better thing to seek
and hope for than he hath promised? If not,
should not the best be preferred. What do
you love and seek your selves? Is money or
fleshly pleasure better than God and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?
Is Sin and Sensuality a better employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
than his Service? Is your flesh and lust
a better master? Compare them, and we are
content that the best be preferred.</p>
            <p>6. Why do you take on you to believe in
Christ, if you be against holiness, and for sin?
Christ came into the world to die for sin,
to shew Gods hatred of it: And would you
have us wilfully to commit it, and to despise
his Blood? He came to destroy the works
of the Devil; and will you plead for them?
He came by his Doctrine, example and
grace to bring man to holy obedience: And
do you hate men for the same, and yet call
your selves Christians?</p>
            <p>7. How dangerously do you draw to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the sin against the Holy-Ghost, if
you hate or blame men for being holy,
or seeking to be such; when it is all the
work of the Holy-Ghost on mens Souls to
make them holy? It's a dangerous thing
to hate the work of the Holy-Ghost; and
as it were defy him, and do despite to
him.</p>
            <p>8. Are you not your selves in your bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:99576:44"/>
Vowed and Devoted to God the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost, renouncing the world,
the Flesh and the Devil? And do you hate
men for being such as you have vowed to be
your selves? And do you think that
God will not severely reckon with you
for such Perjury and base Perfidiousness.</p>
            <p>9. Do you not in your daily hypocritical
devotions condemn your selves by your own
tongues? Do you not pray that the <hi>rest of your
lives may be Pure and Holy?</hi> And at the
same time hate Purity and Holiness? Do
you not pray that <hi>Gods will may be done on
Earth as it is done in Heaven?</hi> And can we
have a higher, purer pattern? Do you know
any that doth Gods will better than it's done
in Heaven? Or is it not damnable hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy
to pray for that which you hate, and hate
all men that desire and endeavour it? When
you say or hear all the ten Commandments,
you pray, <hi>[Lord have mercy upon us and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
our hearts to keep this Law:]</hi> And do you
hate men for endeavouring to keep it? If
you come to the Lords Table, you confess
your sins, and bind your selves in Covenant
to forsake them, and to live a holy life, and
you take the Sacrament upon it; And the
Liturgy warneth you to take heed that you
dissemble not, nor be <hi>hinderers of Gods holy
word, lest the Devil enter into you as he did into</hi>
Judas, <hi>and fill you with all unrighteousness.</hi> And
if you hate or oppose that holy obedience to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:99576:45"/>
God which you profess, after all this, what
must be the portion of such hypocrites? And
in your Creed you profess to believe in
God, the Father, Son and Holy-Ghost, and
to hold a Holy Catholick Church, and the
Communion of Saints; And yet do you
hate Saints that obey the Father, Son
and Holy-Ghost, and hate their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?</p>
            <p>10. Hath not God printed on mans nature
such a sense of the difference between Good
and Evil, as that all Laws and Government
are founded in that sense? And no man
loveth to be counted or called a bad or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,
or unconscionable man: A Lyar, a
Knave, a Perjured man or a wicked man:
And yet do you hate men for avoiding wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness?</p>
            <p>11. Do not you use to accuse Religious
men of some sin or other. (Truly or falsly)
and think by that to make them odious?
And yet do you accuse them, and hate them
most for not sinning? To be Sober, Just
and Godly is but to avoid sins of Omission
and Commission. And do you at once accuse
them as sinners and hate them for obeying
God, and sinning no more?</p>
            <p>12. Doth it never affright you to find the
Devils nature in you, as hating the Divine
or holy nature which is in faithful Godly
men? And to think how openly you serve
the Devil, and do his work? No man that
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:99576:45"/>
believeth there are Devils can doubt, but
that the hatred of God, as holy, and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of his holy Word, and Work, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
is the Devils malignity, and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
of them his work. If he were to
write you his Commandments, they would
be contrary to Gods, and the chief of them
should be, <hi>[Thou shalt not Love God, nor
serve him with all thy Heart, and Soul, and
Might, nor Love those that do so; but hate, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride,
oppose and persecute them.</hi> And is it
honourable openly to serve the Devil? Christ
tells such men, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. That the Devil is
their Father, because they have his nature,
and that his work they do, for he was from
the beginning a Lyar, and a Malignant Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer,
and turned man from obeying God.
And can you think that he loveth you, or
that his Service against God is better than
Gods; or his reward better?</p>
            <p>13. Doth it never touch your Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to consider that you are the Children and
followers of cursed <hi>Cain;</hi> and how punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
his case against <hi>Abel,</hi> and yours against
Gods Servants is the same? <hi>By faith</hi> Abel
<hi>offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than</hi>
Cain, <hi>by which he obtained witness that he was
righteous, God testifying of his Gifts; and by
it he being dead, yet speaketh,</hi> Heb. 11. 4. <hi>Cain</hi>
hated him because God more accepted him
and his offering; 1 <hi>Ioh. 3. 10, 11, 12. In this
the Children of God are manifest, and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99576:46"/>
of the Devil: Whoever doth not righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is not of God, nor he that loveth not his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
For this is the message that ye heard from
the beginning, that we should love one another:
Not as</hi> Cain, <hi>who was of that wicked one, and
slew his Brother: And wherefore slew he him?
because his own works were evil and his brothers
righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>14. Is it possible that any man can unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
believe a Heaven as the reward of holy
obedience, and yet think we can do too
much to obtain it, or be too careful to make
it sure? Is not everlasting glory worth the
cost of a holy life? Or can it be too dearly
bought?</p>
            <p>15. Or is it possible to believe Gods
Judgment, and Hells Punishment, and yet
to hate those that do their best accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Gods own Counsel to escape
it?</p>
            <p>16. What monstrous cruelty is it in you
to wish poor Souls to do that which God
hath told us they shallbe damned for? God
saith, <hi>Without holiness none shall see God,</hi> Heb.
12. 14. <hi>Except your righteousness exceed the
righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, you
shall in no wise enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi>
Mat. 5. 20. <hi>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they
shall see God,</hi> Mat. 5. <hi>If ye live after the Flesh
ye shall die, but if by the Spirit you mortify the
deeds of the Body, ye shall live,</hi> Rom. 8. 7, 8. 13.
<hi>What manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:99576:46"/>
Conversation and Godliness?</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 11. <hi>We
receiving a Kingdom which cannot be moved, let
us serve God acceptably, with Reverence and
Godly fear, for our God is a Consuming Fire,</hi>
Heb. 12. 28, 29. <hi>Be stedfast, unmoveable
always abounding in the work of the Lord,
for asmuch as you know that your Labour is not
in vain in the Lord, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 58. This is the
very tenor of the Gospel: And would you
wish men to damn their Souls for nothing?
To lose Heaven, and suffer Hell for ever,
and all to avoid a pure and holy life? What
a bloody motion is this? Worse than if you
intreated us all to cut our own throats. Let
us try first whether you will do far less at
our request? Will you give the poor all your
Lands and Estates? Will you run into Fire
or Water, or set your own houses on fire
when any will but desire it? It's like you
have heard of the Woman who being
tempted to adultery, desired the tempter
first to hold his Finger in the Fire for her;
Which when he refused, she told him, it
was less reason she should burn in Hell to
Satisfy his lust. If you will not part with
your Life or Estate when another desires
you, why should we part with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for ever, and choose Hell at your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire?</p>
            <p>Yea we see that you will not leave an ill-gotten
gain, or a Sport, or a Whore, or a
Drunken Cup, for all the Love of God, the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:99576:47"/>
blood of Christ, and the hope of Heaven;
And shall we part with God, and Heaven,
and Christ to humour you?</p>
            <p>And what is it that you offer us instead of
all that we must part with? And to ease the
pain which we must undergo? Nothing,
or worse than nothing. If we should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
God and our hope of Heaven, you
cannot give us health or wealth for it:
Much less can you secure these or life to us
till to morrow. And will any thing that
you can give us, be better than Heaven to
us? Or will it make Hell tollerable?</p>
            <p>Will you undertake to answer for it at
the bar of God, if we are charged with an
ungodly, fleshly life, or omitting our necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
duty? You cannot answer for your selves
but by trembling confession: You cannot
save your selves; Nor will all your wealth
and honour get you one drop of Water to
cool your tongues. And shall we trust that
you can answer for us, or save us? When
you would have any man wilfully to neglect
that holy life which God enjoyneth, you
would have him to be madder than one that
would Burn his House, and Kill himself, if
you did but require it. And what horrid
cruelty is this? You are worse than man-eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Cannibals? But the best is you cannot
force us to it; And if you think to hire or
flatter us into Hell, you must have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more to say, and to offer us than we
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:99576:47"/>
yet ever heard of; Much less are we so
much below Bedlams, as to forsake our
Salvation, lest you should call us Precisians,
or Puritans, or any such nick-name or word
of scorn, as doth but shew the folly and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
of the speaker. You will not be
laught or mockt out of your Estates, or
Lives; Nor we out of our Salvation. In
short, Nature is not willing to lie in Hell,
and Grace maketh us desire Heaven; And
we never yet found that any thing else was
more desireable.</p>
            <p>17. And what is there amiss in the
Word or Work of God, and in a serious
godly life, that should make us be against it?
Doth God make bad Laws? Are your wills
and lusts and appetites a better law? Or
could you have taught God to amend the
Bible, or to govern better? God needs us
not: His Laws are all made for our good?
All his ways are pleasantness, and all his
paths are peace. Speak true reason. Is it
a better life to love a Whore, or to please
Lust and Appetite, than to love God?
What is there in Love and Obedience to
God that should make it detestable, or
make us miserable? Is it a greater trouble
to live in hope of Heavenly Glory, than to
live in the despair either of a Sadducee or a
Rebel? You may wiselier tempt us to fall out
with our food, or friends, or health. We
know that Faith and Godliness, are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99576:48"/>
mans duty, but his interest, much more
than health is to our bodies, food to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and the converse of dearest friends to
our delight.</p>
            <p>18. We have had experience of both
ways, and would you have us mad against our
experience? We tryed the World and Sin
too long, and found nothing in it but bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
pleasure and luscious Poyson: Nothing
that will save Soul, life or health: And some
tryal God in mercy hath given us of his love,
and the life of obedient faith and hope:
And the more we try it, the better we find
it: Only we can reach to so small a degree
as doth but tell us how good it is, and make
us long for more. And whether the Devil
would perswade, scorn or affright us from
it, by his own mouth or by yours, we hope
it shall be all in vain.</p>
            <p>19. And who or what are you that would
reason, mock or affright us from a life of
obedience to God? Are you wiser than
God, and dare you give him the lie, that we
should believe you before him? Or are you
better than God, that you can make a better
choice for your selves and us? Are you
more merciful than God, and would save
us from some hurt that he would do us?
Are you truer than God, and more to be
believed? Are you greater than God, and
more to be feared? Or are you not the most
foolish, ignorant and damnably your selves
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99576:48"/>
deluded by the Devil: And shall the words
or mocks of such, drive us to forsake our
Souls and God? Should we obey you and
lie in Hell for it for ever, it would be no
small part of the torment of our Consciences,
to think that we came thither by regarding
the threats or scorns of worms and fools
before all the Word, and Love of God and
our Redeemer.</p>
            <p>20. And before we change our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to God for another course, let us know
what we shall change it for, and whether it
be for something better: Hath your course
made you better or happier than the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
are? Do we not see and feel with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
that the worldly, fleshly, ungodly sort,
are in all Nations the Plagues of the Earth,
and worse to mankind than Wolves and
Serpents? They will not let the world live
in peace; striving and fighting for dominion
and mastership, and more of the world, they
are like Dogs about their Carrion, worrying
and tearing one another: They turn Man
into a more odious creature than Swine or
Toads, by filthy lusts, and horrid prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
They make their Countreys worse
than <hi>Bedlam,</hi> raving against that which the
God of Heaven hath commanded and made
necessary to Salvation. And are these such
good and pleasant fruits as should entice us
to change our master, work and hopes, for
this, and worse that followeth it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:99576:49"/>
And who shall be our Rule, if we forsake
God and his Word? If Princes, how many
minds are they of through the world? And
are they all in the right? Or how shall we
know which is right but by the Word of
God? Or must all men be for the God and
Religion of his King? If it were Prelates,
of how many minds are they through the
world, and how bitter in condemning one
another? If it must be the major part, how
shall obscure men know who those be that
can have no just cognisance of the state of
the Earth, whether Papists, Greeks, Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites,
Nestorians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be the major part?
And how shall we know that the major part
of the Clergy are the best and soundest,
when we see that the major part of the
Laity is usually the worst? Or is it certain
that the Papists Bishops are sounder than our
Protestant Bishops, because they are more?
If we forsake our Concord in God and his
Word, we can have none.</p>
            <p>21. What mean you to do with <hi>Conscience,</hi>
your own, and ours, and other mens? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
is Gods Officer in us, and judgeth of
men and actions as they stand subject to God
and his Judgment. To drive Conscience out
of the world, and to drive all reverence and
obedience to God out of the world, is all
one. To subject Conscience to Lust or Man,
is to subject God to Lust or Man in our esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and practice. And is God so easily
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:99576:49"/>
deposed? And will he give up his Scepter
to a scorner, a drunkard, or a persecutor?</p>
            <p>And what shift will you make at home to
quiet Conscience in your selves? You little
know how deep it biteth, and how hardly it
is quieted, when it is awaked, as shortly and
certainly it will be: Then <hi>Iudas</hi> will bring
back his price, and say, <hi>I have sinned in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
innocent blood;</hi> and all the comfort
his companions will give him is, <hi>See thou to
that: What's that to us?</hi> And hanging or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitating
himself is next. It's like he before
thought as you do, that he could have better
mastered his Conscience: But you may as
wisely think to conquer pain and death.</p>
            <p>But whatever you do with your own, if
we should leave our obedience to God, to
obey you, or any men, we know not what
we should do with our own Consciences,
nor how to quiet them. God hath brought
us out of that Darkness and Lethargy which
quieted them in sin heretofore: And we
cannot now be ignorant of that duty to
God, that self-interest, that danger to wilful
sinners, and that evil of sin, which would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
Hell in us here: And are not your scorns
and threatnings easier than this?</p>
            <p>22. Do not most men at death see the
madness not only of enmity, but of neglect
of a holy life, and wish that they might die
the death of the righteous, and that their
last end might be like his? Had you rather
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:99576:50"/>
die a <hi>Dives</hi> or a <hi>Herod,</hi> or a <hi>Lazarus</hi> or a
<hi>Paul?</hi> Is it not a shame to your devilish
cause and you, to see men live in one mind
and die in another? And scorn, hate and
persecute serious Godliness till the Sentence
of death is past upon them, and then to wish
they were such themselves. Or if you be
more hardened to the last, you are the more
hopeless: But how quickly did such another
change his note, and cry, <hi>Father</hi> Abraham,
<hi>send one to my five brethren to warn them, that
they come not to this place of torment?</hi> If you
mock at these words, you mock at Christ
that spake them, and sure you look not to
be saved by a derided Christ. And it's base
Hypocrisy to deride him, and yet call your
selves Christians, and go to Church as if you
served him. Live as you would die and be
judged, for you shall be judged as you live and
die. Either hold to the mind that you will
never change, or change it quickly before it
be too late.</p>
            <p>23. If you know what a man is, you know
that his Soul is better than his corruptible
flesh; And if you think your Throats and
Guts and Fancies worth all the Cost and
Care and Labour which you bestow on them
in the world, shall not we think our Souls
worth more? What Godly man that you
think makes too much a do for Heaven, doth
bestow more time, and words, and labour
for it, than you do for the Flesh and World?
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:99576:50"/>
Do we not see how men will labour at land,
and venture through dangerous Seas, and
Fight in Wars, and Plot against all that stand
in their way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this all day, from year to
year, and all for Provision for Flesh and Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
And do those that you accuse do more for
their Salvation? If you know not now, you
will shortly know, which makes the better
choice and bargain.</p>
            <p>24 What harm doth Godliness and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
do you in other men? Had you not
rather have a son that takes Disobedience,
Whoredom, Gaming and Drunkenness for
sin, than one that makes no Conscience of
them? Had you not rather have a Wife whose
Conscience restrains her from Scolding
and Adultery, and a Servant that makes
Conscience of robbing or deceiving you,
than one that doth not? Sure unconsciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Servants and Debtors are more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
than they that fear God and believe
that injustice is a damning sin? But the
truth is, most wicked men are for so much
Conscience and Religion in others, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains
them from wronging or hurting
them; but no more, nor for that much in
themselves which may restrain them from
hurting others.</p>
            <p>But if you resolve rather to be damned
than to be Sober, Just and Godly, and obey
God against the flesh; Why cannot you bear
with other men that make a wiser choice?
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:99576:51"/>
What hurt doth their praying do you; or
their preaching, while they are responsible
for any ill Doctrine? What if they be read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scripture, or hearing Directions for
a holy life, while you are Drinking, or
Gaming, or reading a Romance, or Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Libel, doth their Piety hurt you?
What if they dare not Swear and Drink
as you do, doth this do you any harm?
What is it but the Serpentine enmity that
maketh you hate those that never hurt
you?</p>
            <p>25. If you will believe God, it is for the
sake of Godly men that God preserves the
World from ruine: He would have saved
<hi>Sodom</hi> had there been but ten such persons
in it: He will not destroy the world, till
he hath gathered all his chosen out of it: And
do they deserve to be most hated?</p>
            <p>26. How exceeding dear a love hath God
and our Redeemer exprest, to all holy, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
believers? God calls them his Jewels,
his Treasure, in whom he delighteth; He
gave Christ specially for them: He sealeth
them to Salvation by his Spirit: he justifieth
them, and will glorify them in Heaven:
Christ calls them Flesh of his Flesh, his
Friends, his Spouse, they are united to him,
he washeth them in his blood, and feedeth
them with his Flesh, and will make them
equal to the Angels, and will condemn their
Enemies: And are not you devilish enemies
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:99576:51"/>
to God and Christ, who cull out those for
your malice and Enmity, whom God choos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out to magnify the wonders of his Love
on them for ever?</p>
            <p>27. The Angels of Heaven rejoyce at the
Conversion of a sinner, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 10. And
rejoyce to be Christ Servants for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
continually: And is it not Devils
then and their Servants and Souldiers that
are against them? Take heed; Gods Angels
that smote a <hi>Herod,</hi> may do execution on you
ere long.</p>
            <p>28. The Holy Ghost saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. That
the Saints shall judge the world, and even
the Angels, that is, the evil ones: Did you
believe this, you would be afraid to hate and
persecute them now.</p>
            <p>29. Even Heathens are for much honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and worshiping their Gods; yea many
offer them too costly Sacrifice: What praises
doth <hi>Iulian</hi> give to the Sun, and what strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of life doth he Command his Priests?
What great contempt of the Body and the
World, did the Platonists, the Stoicks and the
Cynicks profess? And shall profest Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
hate those that are obedient to the true
God yea to shew that the War between
Good and Evil goeth on in all the World;
even among Heathens those that were for
true virtue were despised and hated by the
sensual.</p>
            <p>30. And is it not a self-condemning thing
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:99576:52"/>
in those that accuse Gods Servants as mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too much adoe in obeying the Law of
God, and yet make (as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
doth) abundance more Laws or Canons of
their own, and require precise obedience to
them all? Yea will burn men at a Stake
for breaking their Laws; Doth God make
too much work in the Judgment of them
that think it not enough without much more,
as if Gods Law were too narrow and insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient?
Yea learn by the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
whose Canons (5, 6, 7, 8.) <hi>ipso facto</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
them that do but affirm any
thing to be repugnant to Gods word in their
Liturgy, Ceremonies or Church Governing
Offices: And can you think that obeying
God deserveth hatred, when disobeying men
deserveth excommunication? Learn of our late
Laws, which account all the Ministers of
<hi>England</hi> worthy to be cast out and silenced if
they dare not take the imposed Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Oaths and Subscriptions, and do what
the Act of Uniformity imposeth; And
do you think it worthy of reproach to be
as strict in obeying Gods known Laws,
as is required to the Act of Uniformity and
the Canons?</p>
            <p>31. Even the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> applaudeth
great Rigor and Strictness of life, in such as
will obey the Pope; And they have allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Orders of Fryars whose rules tye them to
great abstinence, to much praying, and some
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:99576:52"/>
to much Preaching, so that Religion is all
their calling. And shall the strict obeying of
Gods known Laws render men odious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
professed Protestants? Yea the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
honour the very Bones and Relicks of
their dead Saints? And you your selves
keep holy days for many Saints: And will
you at the same time hate and hurt those
that endeavour to imitate them? Will you
imitate those Pharisees whom Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
Woe against, who at once honoured
the dead Prophets with building them Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
or Tombs, and murdered the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that succeeded them?</p>
            <p>32. You can never come to Heaven, or be
saved from Hell your selves, without serious
Holiness, Justice and Sobriety: And will
you hate that without which you cannot be
saved?</p>
            <p>33. Scarce any sin doth more certainly
prove you to be ungodly, than hating godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
What ever hope there may be of
those that sin against Conscience, and wish
to be better, and purpose Repentance, that
man cannot be a truly Godly man, that is an
Enemy to godliness, so that this is a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
deaths mark on you.</p>
            <p>34. You would extirpate the principle of
self-love, which God hath made insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
from us. There is somewhat in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which we cannot lay by, which makes
us unwilling to be damned. If you that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:99576:53"/>
no Hell, dare venture into it, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do so, who do believe it. If you say,
that it is our folly to believe that none shall
be saved without <hi>Holiness,</hi> and mortifying
the deeds of the body by the Spirit, bear
with that folly which doth you no harm: It
is not Men or Devils that we had it from,
but the Holy Ghost in Scripture. If it be
your wisdom to give God the lie, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
a Drunken sot, or the Devil, before
him, it shall be none of ours: Speed as you
choose, and let us speed as we choose: we
shall meet your Souls shortly in another
mind and tune. Strive not to make us choose
damnation now our Eyes are open: We
were once too easily befool'd: but cannot
now so hate our selves.</p>
            <p>35. Moreover, he that would not have
a man live a life of holy obedience to God,
would have him lay by that which he was
made for, and that which God continueth
his life for, and that which he hath his reason
and all his daily mercies for. What else
have we to do in the World? Have men
going to the Grave and Eternity, nothing to
do but Eat and Drink, and Laugh, and Play,
and run up and down like Ants with sticks
and straws, and then die, and call all vanity
and vexation too late? If we may not spend
our time in making sure of a better World,
we had rather we had never been born, or
had died in infancy, or that we had a dose
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99576:53"/>
of <hi>Opium</hi> that would make us sleep out the
rest of our lives in quietness, rather than
spend it as you do, and then give a sad ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ount
of all: we had rather we had been
Birds or Beasts, Dogs or Swine than Men,
were it not for that life which you hate,
and the hopes which depend on it. It had
been a greater kindness to us to have mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
us at the birth, than to tempt us to
live for our damnation.</p>
            <p>36. What do you think it is that is Gods
<hi>Image on mans Soul,</hi> you know that it's said in
Scripture that God made man at first in his
own Image, and that Christ by his Spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neweth
them to that Image. What is it
think you, God hath not hands and feet, and
bodily parts as we have? It is the Soul that
hath his Image. And do you think it is the
love of Money, and Lust, and Sport, or
Gluttony, or Drunkenness that is his
Image? Scripture saith <hi>Eph. 4. 23, 24. Colos.</hi>
3. 10. it is <hi>Holiness:</hi> And this is called the
<hi>Divine nature,</hi> as coming from God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
nature unto God. Either Holiness,
Wisdom and Righteousness is Gods Image,
or else there is none such on man; And
then you make Gods Word to be false.
And if this be it, and this it which you hate,
are you not haters of God? And is not that
to be devilish and hated by God?</p>
            <p>37. While you are angry at them that
say few are saved, or that none but Saints
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:99576:54"/>
or serious godly obedient men are saved,
you would sink all the World into utter des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair,
and make none or next none to be
saved. One part of the haters of godliness
believe no life to come; And these would
have all men despair. For if there be none,
there is none to be hoped for: and they that
think men die but as Dogs &amp; Swine do, must
be expected to live like Dogs &amp; Swine. The
other part of you, labour by all means to
make themselves and others believe that
the profession of more godliness than world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
carnal men have, is but hypocrisy, and
that such are at the heart as bad as others:
And if this be so, what is the consequence,
but that <hi>none are saved?</hi> For unless you will
give God the lie, or be saved in spite of
him, you must believe that none are saved
that are not sanctified by the Spirit of Christ,
and live not after the Spirit, mortifying the
flesh, <hi>Ioh. 3 3, 5. Heb. 12. 14. Rom. 8. 6, 7.
8, 9, 13. 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 17. And that no man can
be saved that loveth the world more than
God and Heaven, and fleshly pleasure more
than holiness. And therefore if there be
none such, then none are saved. Hypocrisy
will not save men: God tells us that Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards,
Fornicators, Covetous, Thieves, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioners,
Revilers, Effeminate, Idolaters,
cannot enter into the Kingdom of God,
1 <hi>Cor. 6. 9, 10. Eph.</hi> 5. 5. And if any <hi>man
love the world</hi> (best) the <hi>love of the Father
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99576:54"/>
is not in him, 1 Ioh.</hi> 2. 5. And if all that
pretend to be better are hypocrites, than
none at all are saved.</p>
            <p>It may be you have the kindness to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
some few. But if those few be all that
be not either carnal men (described <hi>Rom.
8. 5, 6, 7, 9.)</hi> or hypocrites, how few then
do you make to be saved, if God be true?</p>
            <p>38. Who do you think it is that Christ
meaneth, when he saith, <hi>I send you as Lambs
among Wolves? Ye shall be hated of all men for
my names sakes; Blessed are they that suffer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
for righteousness sake? When they say
all manner of evil of you falsly for my sake: The
World will hate you as it hated me, because you
are not of the World, but I have chosen you out of
the World: Marvel not if the World hate you?
As many as will live godly in Christ Iesus shall
suffer Persecution, &amp;c.</hi> Who do you think all
this is spoken of? It is not of you, that are
fleshly, worldly, ungodly men; Who Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth
you for righteousness sake? Who
hateth, revileth or imprisoneth, or fineth
you, for living <hi>godly in Christ</hi> Jesus? Do you
suffer as much for reviling Preachers, as we
have done for Preaching? What suffer you
for all the Oaths that be sworn daily in
Streets and Taverns, and the horrid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness,
Atheism, Sadduceism, Infidelity
that men are guilty or? If you did suffer
for Whoredom, Drunkenness, Blasphemy
is that for Christ or righteousness? When
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99576:55"/>
the Holy Ghost saith, <hi>As he that was born
after the Flesh persecuted him that was born af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Spirit, even so it is now,</hi> is it such as you
that he meaneth? When <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>[They
speak evil of you, and falsly accuse your good
conversation in Christ, 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 16. whom
meaneth he? When he saith, 1 <hi>Pet. 4. They
think it strange that you run not with them to all
excess of ryot (lasciviousness, lusts, excess of
wine, revellings, banquetings and abominable
idolatry)</hi> who do you think he meaneth?
And when he saith, 1. <hi>Pet. 2. 9. Ye are a
chosen Generation, a royal Priest-hood, a holy
Nation, a peculiar People, that ye should shew
forth the praises of him that hath called you out
of darkness into his marvellous light;</hi> who is it
that he meaneth? You'll say, <hi>It is Christians:</hi>
True: But is it Hypocrites? Is it those
that will say at last, <hi>Lord we have Prophesied
in thy Name, and Eat and Drunk in thy presence,
to whom Christ will say, Depart from me, ye
workers of Iniquity, I know you not?</hi> Sure
false Christians are worse than Heathens.</p>
            <p>39. The way which you take against Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
persons doth shew who it is that sets
you on work, and what it is that is the root
of your enmity. As Gods Image is in the
<hi>understanding, will</hi> and <hi>executive power</hi> of man,
so is Satans; and he is accordingly described
by Christ, to be 1. A Liar and Deceiver;
2. A Malignant, Hater of Goodness, or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness;
and a cause of sin; 3. A hurtful
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99576:55"/>
murderer or destroyer. And these are the
three ways by which Godly people are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
in the world. 1. Belying them is
grown so common with their enemies, that
there is nothing scarcely so notoriously false
which they will not affirm of them, and it's
well if some will not preach it, print it, or
swear it: And they make one another easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believe it. Till experience proved it, I
did not think that humane nature had been
liable to such impudent, monstrous lying.</p>
            <p>2. The daily business of many is, by wit
and diligence to draw men to hate Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
men on false pretences: As plainly as
Christ preacheth and urgeth <hi>Love,</hi> as his great
Commandment; so plainly do these press
and urge men to Hatred: But of this before.</p>
            <p>3. And Hatred tends to <hi>Hurtfulness:</hi>
What plotting and labouring is there in the
world, to ruine and destroy each other?
The malignant spirit is blood-thirsty. It's
strange how the unclean Devils thirst to
draw or suck some blood from Witches.
Nothing more alienates me from the Papal
Kingdom, than that it lives like Leeches up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
blood. To read over the History of the
Inquisition, and of their Massacres, would
make Men take Toads, and Adders, and
mad Dogs, and Wolves, for harmless things
in comparison of some Men. If any would
requite them (or others) with the like, I
hate it in Protestant or Papist. The Turks
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:99576:56"/>
conquered the Greek Empire, partly by the
mutinous divisions of the Christians, and
partly by promising them Liberty of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
And when the Christians thought
they should have that, they yielded up the
Empire with the less resistance. And that
which was so advantageous to the Infidels,
might, well used and limited, be more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
to the Christian Truth and
Church.</p>
            <p>But though good things may be used in
an ill cause, it is a sign of a bad cause which
needeth bad means. That cause which is
carried on by Lying, Perjury and Deceit, by
malignant Love-killing, endeavours, and by
cruelty, and hurtfulness, and blood, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
made suspicious to all wise men. It is a
wonder of impudency in <hi>Baronius, Binnius</hi>
and other Papists, to justifie <hi>Martin,</hi> a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonized
Saint, for renouncing Communion
to the death with the Synods and Bishops
who perswaded the Emperor to draw the
Sword against the Gnostick Priscillianists;
and themselves to defend a thousand-fold
greater cruelties and murders in their own
Church on the account of Religion: But
sin is mad self-contradiction.</p>
            <p>4. I conclude with this great truth: They
that hate and oppose Godly mens obedience
to God, do seek to silence the chief Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ, and to cast out Christianity
from the Earth. Christianity cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:99576:56"/>
to be true, but by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is
its Seal and Witness. This Witness of the
Spirit was not only extraordinary in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
and numerous Miracles, but also or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
in the work of Sanctification. This
Seal is set on all that shall be saved in
all times and places. The Lord knoweth
who are his: And let him that nameth the
name of Christ depart from iniquity. <hi>He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
us to purifie to himself a peculiar people
zealous of good works: Teaching us, that deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live
soberly, righteously and godly in this present
world: Looking for that blessed hope, and the
glorious appearing of the great God and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Iesus Christ, Tit.</hi> 2. 12, 13, 14. By this
healing work Christ is known to be indeed
our Physician, the real Saviour that saveth
his people from their sins. As man gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth
man, and the Father is known by the
similitude of the Child; and as he is known
to be a good Artist that can make others
such. This is Christs standing Witness in
all times and places. And when you would
turn this into scorn, and cloud it with slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
or the charge of Hypocrisie, and
would have such judged an odious people,
and have them driven out of the world,
what do you in effect but spit in the face
of Christ, and crown him with Thorns, and
call him a Deceiver, and crucifie him afresh,
and seek to expel Christianity from the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:99576:57"/>
Earth? What reasonable man could believe
Christ to be Christ, the Saviour of the
world, if he did not sanctifie men, and make
them much better and fitter for Heaven
than other men?</p>
            <p>So that in this you directly militate for
the Devil, the World and the Flesh, against
God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, against
the Holy Catholick Church, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Saints, and the Hope of Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
and life everlasting; which if you
did openly under the name of Infidels or
Heathens, or rather as the profest Souldiers
of the Devil, it were less disingenuous and
hypocritical, than to do it in the Church,
and under Christs colours, and in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
name.</p>
            <p>And you must be sure that you are stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than God and our Saviour, if you will
prevail to the last. God hath undertaken
the defence of the Just: Christ hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
to present them triumphant before
his Father, and cast their Enemies into Hell.
Are you sure you can overcome him? Vile
Worms that cannot fetch a breath without
him! When began you to be stronger than
God? Was it in the womb? or in Infancy
when you could not go? Or was it when
the Devil and the Flesh made you mad or
drunken in ignorant malice? If so, the drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
fit will soon be over, and God will
awake a tormenting Wit. If you can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:99576:57"/>
God, try your strength first on his
works: Stop the Sun: change Night and
Day: turn the Tide of the Sea: live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Meat or Air: resolve that you will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
die: save all your Friends from death.
Can you do none of this, and yet will you
venture a War against God? Or do you
think to fight against his Servants, and bribe
him to be on your side, and forsake them to
your rage? Did Christ take Mans Nature,
and die to save them, and will he now turn
on Satans side against them? He overcame
the Devils temptation on Earth; yea called
<hi>Peter</hi> Satan, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. when he would have
tempted him not to die for his chosen. Let
Men or Devils go try him in his Glory,
whether he will change his mind, and take
your part against his own holy Truth and
Servants.</p>

            <head>Chap. IV. Objections and false Accusations
answered.</head>
            <p>BUT I know that as Christ and his
Apostles were not hated, nor killed
without pretended cause and reason, nor the
Martyrs murdered without accusation; so
none will now justifie the scorning or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting
an innocent person, or a Saint as
such, but they will first make them odious,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:99576:58"/>
and seem worthy of all that is done against
them. They will say, <hi>It is not godly men, but
wicked Hypocrites that we hate and prosecute;
a false and odious sort of persons, who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly,
and set up their own wit and will against
the Laws and Governours of the several King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
where they live: They are the very worst
of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> If they are so indeed, they are none
of the men that I am pleading for, nor you
the men that I reprove. But before we come
to particular Accusations, it is your wisdom
to answer these few Questions.</p>
            <p>1. Have you particular matter against
them to make good this charge? Or is it
only a general malicious Accusation?</p>
            <p>2. Is it individual persons that you mean,
by whom it's proved? or do you thus accuse
whole companies of men? What if one
said of Papists, Jews or Turks, They are
Murderers, Adulterers, Perjured, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Do
you think he were not an odious slanderer,
to speak that of all or most, or the whole
Party, which he can prove but by some
few?</p>
            <p>3. Do you know all the persons whom
you accuse? And have you heard it proved?
Or do you not say this of whole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
assembled to worship God, of whom
you know not one of many? If this be so,
it's inhumane calumny.</p>
            <p>4. Have the particular persons been heard
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:99576:58"/>
speak for themselves, and give the reason of
their actions? and were they proved insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient?
Or were they condemned unheard?
Or was Gods Word derided and taken for
no reason?</p>
            <p>5. Do you not know that the Devil is
the great Accuser of the Brethren? and that
he hath malice and craft enough to say as
bad as you can say, by the best of men? and
must he be believed?</p>
            <p>6. Are you sure you can make God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
you, that these men are as bad as you
affirm? If not, and if he find a man in prison
for obeying his word, and ask who laid
him there, will you undertake to prove that
he was laid there for some crime? If God
own him, and say, he is my Servant, will you
confute him, and say, No, but he is a Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
God knoweth a Saint from a Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
better than you do. Sheep-steelers use
to sheer the sheep and cut out the mark: But
they have to do with men: Gods mark is
where man cannot take it away; And the
foundation of God standeth sure. The Lord
knoweth who are his.</p>
            <p>7. Know you not that Christ, and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
and all the Martyrs were as deeply
charged, and put to death as Malefactors?
We must then have better proof than accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</p>
            <p>8. If they prove faithful Christians whom
you thus accuse, Christ hath undertaken
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:99576:59"/>
their Justification: It is his office. And do
you think to baffle him? Can he not answer
you? <hi>Rom. 8. 32, 33, 35. Who shall lay any
thing to the charge of Gods elect? It is God
that justifieth: Who is he that will condemn
them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. Have you not greater sins your selves
than those whom you accuse? If so, you
condemn your selves. Would you have
God judge of them as you do? If so, do you
not tell him how to judge of you, and even
crave him to condemn you?</p>
            <p>10. Doubtless you know that you are
sinners: And how think you to be justified
at the Bar of God? Is there any but Christ
to judge and justify you? And do you think
he will justifie his Enemies, that hated, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
and condemned his Servants?</p>
            <p>11. Those that dwell near godly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
and should know them, are more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excusable
for their malice and slanders than
forreigners and strangers are. Men of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
land or age may be deceived by lying
fame or history. But you that are their
Neighbours are without excuse. I speak
for none but persons fearing and obeying
God: And you might easily have known
that they are neither Fornicators, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards,
Perjur'd, swearers, Liars, Oppressors,
Thieves, nor suffer for any such crimes as
these.</p>
            <p>12. And if they are as wicked as you say,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:99576:59"/>
why do you not prosecute them for such
wickedness? What are the French Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
now prosecuted and ruin'd for? Have
any Judicatures proved them guilty of any
such crimes against God or Man? Or is it
not only for worshiping God contrary to
the Kings and Prelates Laws? And how is
that? As Christs Apostles did: They refuse
nothing in Gods worship which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
or any of Christs Apostles used,
or any Churches in their days or long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And did the Apostles offer God so
odious a worship as deserved hatred and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction?
When <hi>Daniels</hi> Enemies designed
his ruine, they said, <hi>Dan. 6. We shall find no
matter against this</hi> Daniel <hi>except it be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Law of his God;</hi> And so they got a
Law made against praying to any God but
the King for a certain time. <hi>Daniel</hi> must be
cast to the Lions for breaking the Kings
Law: The poor flies deserve death for
coming into the Spiders Web: But did not
the venomous Worm Spin it of purpose out
of her own Bowels, or condensate air, to
take and kill the flies by craft? In <hi>England</hi>
there are many that worship God as the
French Protestants do, and no better than
Christs Apostles did: If this be their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
wickedness that makes them unworthy
to live out of Prison, say so, and pretend
no other. But if it be Heresie, false Doctrine,
Perjury, Fornication, Robbing, Treason, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:99576:60"/>
or any other crime, why are they
not accused of these before the Judges? And
why are those charged with them that never
were so accused and proved guilty? Will
not all wise men take those persons for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
Liars, who by their published accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations
thus odiously charge multitudes, and
never offer to prove it against them at the
Judicatures? Their accusation shews they
want not will, therefore their not prosecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them for any such sort of crimes, shews
that it is truth that is wanting.</p>
            <p>13. And if they be such wicked persons,
whence is it, that they are charged meerly
with Hypocrisy, by such as say, that they
live soberly and justly and demurely, but
they are at the heart as bad as others.
Their accusers commonly confess that they
are most free from all immoralities, and
have an outward shew of righteousness, but
these heart-searchers see that their hearts are
bad. And do they not by this confute their
own accusations?</p>
            <p>14. And why is it that they that know
them best can see none of the wickedness
which you accuse them of, (beyond those hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
infirmities of which they most accuse
themselves). As I have oft done, I again
solemnly profess, as one that cannot be far
from my account before the judge of all the
the World, that having now lived to the
68th year of my age, and been most familiar
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:99576:60"/>
since the age of sixteen or seventeen, with
that sort of men whom the Vulgar then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Puritans (described by Mr. <hi>Bolton</hi> and
such other Conformists) though I have met
with many that had their mistakes and frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and troublesome differences in lesser
things, and some Hypocrites intruded among
them, yet I never knew any other sort of
men comparable to them in Christian Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
Faith, Obedience to God, Hatred of
sin, Care of their duty to God and man, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety,
Temperance, Chastity, Truth, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
desires, endeavours and hopes: And
that they so far excelled the rest of my
acquaintance, as made their grace amiable
to me, and confirmed my belief of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Scripture: Yea more, if I had not had
the happiness of knowing such a sort of men
that in holiness, Justice and Love excelled
the rest of my acquaintance, or at least cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly
heard of such, I could not have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
in Christ, as a Saviour of men whom
he made no better than Turks and Infidels;
Nor could I have believed a Heaven for men
no better prepared for it. And that now
near my end, I see so great a difference in
Holiness, Justice and Charity, between
those commonly reviled for worshiping God
but as the Apostles did, and those that hate
and persecute them, as greatly helps me in
believing that there is a Saviour and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier,
and Heaven for the faithful, and a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:99576:61"/>
that deceives the rest, and a hell that will
receive them; which is even visibly begun on
Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Accus.</hi> But <hi>(say they)</hi> it is not for their
Godliness or Sobriety that we accuse them, but
for their sin, and wickedness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Still this is but General, and signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
nothing. But, 1. What is that odious
sin? 2. It's Gods merciful Providence that
keeps sin in general under such shame, as
that the actors of it speak against it, even in
their slanders. 3. But if this be the true
cause why do you cull out those that have
least sin to fasten your accusations of sin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
If there be a conformable Minister that
is more Holy, Charitable, and Zealous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
sin than the rest, he is one of those
that is called a <hi>Puritan</hi> and accused of sin?
Why do we hear none of your furious
charges against the common Drunkards Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers,
Gamesters, Whoremongers, Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors,
Profane Blasphemers, Lyars, and the
Families that call not upon God, shew no
serious regard of any Religion at all? You
can live among these, and Swear and Drink,
and Play with them, and never cry out against
them as bad men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:99576:61"/>
               <hi>Accus.</hi> But religion, being the best thing, the
Corrupters of that are worse than Drunkards, and
Swearers, and Adulterers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Such corrupters there may be as are
worse indeed: But what is it that they cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Religion in? They subscribe to all the
Bible, and the ancient Creeds? And if need
be to the <hi>English</hi> Articles of Religion. Is
not all that enough? Their many large pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
writings tell the world their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in Religion; Such as Mr. <hi>Arthur Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dershams,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> Mr. <hi>Greenhams, Dods,
Anthony Burges, Richard Alleins,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
such: What errors are in
these?</p>
            <p>2. Why are they not these twenty years
accused of Preaching false Doctrine, and
proved guilty and punisht for it, if they are
such?</p>
            <p>3. If it be not in Doctrine what is it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Accus.</hi> They worship God contrary to the
Law; in not using the Common-Prayer book.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Those that constantly joyn in the
Parish Churches in the Common-Prayer are
as much hated, Reviled and Prosecuted as
the rest. Therefore this charge is but hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisy.</p>
            <p>2. What do they that for matter or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:99576:62"/>
is positively contrary to Law in Gods
worship: They read Scripture, Pray, Preach,
Praise God with Psalms, Communicate in
the Lords Supper: Doth the Law forbid any
of this?</p>
            <p>3. Not using the rest of the Liturgy is a
Negation, and no Act at all, and therefore
no act of worship, and therefore no unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
act, no more than silence is: He that is
silent, and he that omits the rest of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,
worships not God by using it; but
he doth nothing contrary to it, or forbidden
by it.</p>
            <p>4. If <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were unknown in
<hi>England,</hi> and worshipt God but as they did
on Earth, would you therefore call them
Rogues or Rebels, or lay them in the jail?
Did they worship God in an odious, intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
manner? Did the Holy-Ghost by them
write an infallible Rule for all things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
in Religion? and yet are they unsuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
rogues that worship God but according
to that rule?</p>
            <p>5. Are they wiser men than they that
have made us another rule or worship? or have
they more of Gods Spirit, and more authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in religion?</p>
            <p>6. Do not the Imposers say that all which
they add is <hi>no part of Religion,</hi> but <hi>things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent?</hi>
And are they odious corrupters of
Religion, who omit no part of Religion, but
only humane indifferent things?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:99576:62"/>
7. Do you not reverence the Church for
some hundred years after Christ, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
no Liturgies, but left every Pastor to use
his own Prayers?</p>
            <p>8. Do you not harden the Papists that
call our Religion new, and ask where it was
two hundred years ago, if you make the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy
as now formed and imposed, our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
when it is not two hundred years
old.</p>
            <p>9. The Godly Bishops of <hi>England</hi> have
ever owned the other Protestant Churches,
and their Communion, who have none of
our Liturgies, nor any like it.</p>
            <p>10. If this be the odious crime, why do
you never Revile or Prosecute the Atheists,
Infidels, Sadduces, Hobbists, and those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thousands that seldom if ever go to any
Church, or worship God publickly at all? Is
the worship that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> used worse
than irreligiousness and infidelity?</p>
            <p>11. Who can believe that you are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
zealous against misworshiping God,
when you can ordinarily your selves be in a
drinking house or playing house, at the time
of publick worship? And when so few of
you ever so much as worship God in your
Families, by Prayer, or read the Scripture,
or Catechise your families?</p>
            <p>12. Is it not a strange thing to hear men
accuse others for not using the Liturgy in
Gods worship, and at the same time would
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:99576:63"/>
have them that refuse it, to be forbidden all
publick worshiping of God at all? Doth this
signify any dislike of their omitting Gods
worship? Which is the more ungodly omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion?
to omit all worship of God and live
like Atheists, or to omit only so much of the
Liturgy as the Apostles used not? I have
known many that could not eat cheese, as is
said before (nor scarce smell it without
danger of Death:) If you would have a
Law made that such shall eat no other meat,
few wisemen will believe that it is their
health and life that you desire. If a man
fail in paying his Landlord some odd act of
Service, will you make a Law that he shall
pay nothing at all? If a Subject neglect pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some excise, or using Bow and Arrows,
will you forbid him paying any thing, or
serving the King at all? Sure they that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
men all publick worship, be offended at
somewhat else than that men do not rightly
worship God, unless they think that not to
worship him at all is better than doing it
without their Book.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But he shall be Compelled to better
worship.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> How? when he lieth in jail he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
publickly worship God at all. Is that bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
worship? I know it is banishment which
some would have executed. And will men
worship God any better among Heathens or
Infidels, or others? Or why should other
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:99576:63"/>
Countries endure them, if they be not to be
endured in their own?</p>
            <p>Are not English-men that worship God
only by their own Book, as much Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists
when they are in other Lands,
<hi>France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Holland,</hi> &amp;c.
as those are here that do not use it: And
are they there intolerable and worthy of
ruine?</p>
            <p>Did the Apostles or first Churches banish
any on such accounts? Will Christ banish
them from his Kingdom? Hath he made
any such Laws? And is not he the absolute
Soveraign? Hath he left his Servants to the
will of man, to use them how they will, or
cast out of his Church whom they will? Are
you sure these are none of the number of
whom Christ saith, I was hungry and ye fed
me not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In as much as ye did it not to
one of the least of these my Brethren, you did
it not to me, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Accus.</hi> But they are Schismaticks, and
Separate from the Church; and is not that a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
sin?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Being speaking only to malignant
enemies of serious Godliness, I say; It is not
only Separatists that you hate, but Godly
Conformists yea perhaps most of all, because
you are more restrained from hurting them.
How oft hear we Curses and Revilings against
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:99576:64"/>
               <hi>Conforming Puritanes,</hi> or as some call them
<hi>[Church Whigs.]</hi> If they are not haters of
their brethren, but Friends to Love and
Peace, you nickname them <hi>[Trimmers.]</hi> And
cursing those whom Christ blesseth, when
he saith, <hi>[Blessed be the Peace-makers, for
theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven]</hi> You say,
<hi>[Cursed be the Trimmers, and would the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
were rid of them.]</hi> It is any that are for
a holy life, and obedience to God, that you
abhor.</p>
            <p>2. As I said before, you spare those that
come to the Parish Churches no more than
others: The old Nonconformists wrote
more against Separation than any else in
<hi>England</hi> did. And yet were hated as intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
The reconcilers who are since made
Nonconformists, did publickly offer to be
Subject to Arch-Bishops and Bishops, to use
the Liturgy themselves if reformed, and if
it were not, yet never pleaded for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration:
And yet are never the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured.</p>
            <p>2. But <hi>who</hi> is it that they <hi>separate from?</hi>
Do they not profess Union and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with the whole Catholick Church on
Earth? What separation do you mean? Is
it their <hi>Local absence?</hi> And are not you
such Separatists from all the world, saving
the Assembly where you meet? One cannot
be in two places at once.</p>
            <p>Or is it that they <hi>dislike</hi> somewhat in
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:99576:64"/>
your <hi>Forms</hi> of Worship? so they may in
others Forms, with whom yet they profess
Communion: And <hi>in what</hi> is it that they
shew dislike or separation? They hold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with you as Christians, and as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
from Popery: They separate not
from Papists as Christians: And from you
it is only for that which you say is no part
of your Worship or Religion, but things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different;
which they think to be sin. And
are those Separatists from <hi>your Church,</hi> who
only separate from that which is <hi>no part</hi> of
<hi>your Church</hi> or <hi>Worship?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Are the French and Dutch Churches
in <hi>London</hi> Schismaticks or Separatists, who
profess Communion with our Churches,
though they use not our Oaths, Subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or Liturgy? Liking their own mode
better, and preferring it, is no Separation.
If I like your Liturgy better than any in the
<hi>Bibliotheca Patrum,</hi> is that separating from
all Churches that use the rest?</p>
            <p>4. Who are the Schismaticks in <hi>France,
Italy, Poland, &amp;c.</hi> Those that are called so,
and persecuted as such; or those that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
on them the things which they judge
sinful?</p>
            <p>What if you were in a Presbyterian
Land, where the Liturgy and Prelacy are
forbidden, and another Form set up by Law;
and you should contrary to that Law use the
Liturgy and Ceremonies; or at least refuse
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:99576:65"/>
subscribing against Prelacy, and for Lay
Elders? If they excommunicated or ruined
you for this, who do you think were guilty
of the Schism?</p>
            <p>5. Do they forsake the Assemblies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are <hi>excommunicated?</hi> Or is it not
an odd thing for to excommunicate men
first, and then accuse them for not coming to
Church? I have known Ministers stop in
the midst of Publick Worship, and refuse to
go on, till an excommunicate person went
out. The whole representative Church of
<hi>England</hi> do in their 5, 6, 7, and 8 Canons
<hi>ipso facto,</hi> without tryal or sentence, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
all in <hi>England,</hi> who <hi>affirm any thing
to be sinful or repugnant to Gods Word, in the
Church Governing Offices whatsoever,</hi> in the
<hi>Liturgy, Ceremonies</hi> or <hi>Articles.</hi> And shall
they after this be called Separatists for not
coming in? Doth not the Canon shew that
the Church would not have them come in,
when they cast them out?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But the Church and Canon bid them
repent of that their wicked errour, and publickly
confess it, and so come in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Is a mans Judgment absolutely
in his power? Can a man believe a thing to
be a <hi>wicked errour</hi> meerly because the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
saith so? He that can believe what his
list, believeth nothing truly. If this Belief
be necessary to Church Communion, and to
escape damning Schism, it is necessary to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:99576:65"/>
Salvation: Why then is it not in the
Creed, Ten Commandments or Bible? Do
you call them the <hi>things Indifferent,</hi> and then
call it a <hi>wicked errour</hi> to hold them <hi>sinful?</hi>
Is not this to make it necessary to Salvation
or Communion, to have so much Learning
or Knowledge, as to-<hi>know all Indifferent
words and things in the world to be indifferent,</hi>
which men will impose? I would all
Church-Members with your and others
knew all <hi>necessary</hi> things. Do you believe
in your heart that all, or half the Parishio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
do know these things to be lawful, or
understand any more of them than those
that think otherwise? when thousands can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
answer a necessary question of the
Creed or Catechism; nor know who Christ
is, and how he saveth us?</p>
            <p>Why is there not a Catechism made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the sound proof that <hi>Lay-Chancellors</hi>
power of the Keys, and Diocesan Bishops
that have no Bishops under them, and our
present Court-Church discipline, and all the
Rubrick, Ceremonies and Forms are lawful,
if all must be excommunicate that think
and say otherwise?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> If they are so ignorant that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
know Church Orders to be lawful, they are
not fit to communicate with the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Make no Church Orders necessary
to Communion, but what Christ and his
Apostles have made necessary to it; and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:99576:66"/>
then cast out and spare not all as ignorant
that refuse them.</p>
            <p>2. But again, do you believe that most,
or all that you keep in, are wiser and more
knowing than those that you cast out? How
shall such as I believe you, who know that
in all the Parishes which my cohabitation
allowed me to know, it is the most know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and religious part that most dissent, and
the generality of the grosly ignorant that
understand few Articles of the Creed, do
conform. As ignorant as I am, and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of my calling and mind, I would I
were not only silenced and imprisoned, but
put to death, on condition that all that you
now receive as Members of the Church,
had no more ignorance than we have. But
it's our lot, to tire our selves with teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
poor people to understand their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
Christianity, Creed, Lords Prayer, and
Ten Commandments, and leave most igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
when all's done, and yet our selves af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
our hardest and longest study, to be
judged so ignorant about some Indifferent
things, as to be unfit for Ministry or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Accus.</hi> If men will not obey Church Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
and Laws, they are Rebels, and unfit for
Christian Society. If every man shall follow his
own fancy, what Order will there be? Do not
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:99576:66"/>
all Churches require obedience to their Orders?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The Church hath One Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
King, who hath made Universal Laws
for all; which must be first obeyed, and
against which no man hath power. And
yet his <hi>own Laws</hi> have things <hi>necessary</hi> to all,
in which they must unite, and <hi>Integrals</hi> and
<hi>Accidents</hi> which all know not, in which
they must bear with one another. No man
understandeth all the Bible: And are <hi>many
Laws</hi> and Books more necessary than
Gods?</p>
            <p>2. Whoever depraveth the necessary
points of Religion by his own fancies, should
be rejected. But all men living err in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
lesser things.</p>
            <p>3. In what Countreys is it that your Rule
holds, that Rulers must be thus far obeyed
in Religion? Is it in <hi>China,</hi> or <hi>Pegu,</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dostan,</hi>
or <hi>Turky?</hi> Or is it in <hi>Italy, Spain, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Silesia, Bavaria,</hi> or <hi>France?</hi> Or is it
at <hi>Geneva, Holland,</hi> or the Presbyterian
Countreys? Or is it only in <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Ireland?</hi> And was it so here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. or only since? And
how shall any know where it is, unless he
try and judge his Rulers Commands by the
Laws of God? Will you follow this Rule
in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain?</hi> Or shall all Subjects
judge of Kings capacities?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:99576:67"/>
               <hi>Accus.</hi> But, they hold unlawful Assemblies
of their own, and worship God contrary to Law,
and yield not so much as Passive Obedience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. You know the Ministers are
forbidden their Office, unless they will
take those Oaths, Subscriptions, Professions
and Practices, which they dare not take,
for fear of sin and damnation: And they
would be thankful if their reasons may be
heard, and if any will instruct them better:
And they are confirmed in their Opinion
by the answers, or no answers rather, made
to the reasons already given in. And they
are devoted or vowed to the sacred Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
in their Ordination: And if there be
such a sin as <hi>Sacriledge</hi> in the world, they
are confident it were <hi>Sacriledge</hi> in them to
alienate themselves from the Office which
they have undertaken. As it is <hi>Apostacy</hi> from
<hi>Christianity</hi> to violate our Baptismal Vow,
though men should command it, they doubt
not but it is <hi>perfidious Apostacy</hi> from the <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Ministry,</hi> to violate the <hi>Ordination Vow,</hi>
though Bishops silence them: As it is <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi>
to violate the <hi>Conjugal Contract,</hi> though
a Bishop should require it; seeing he that
married them hath no power to unmarry
them, unless they do it first themselves, and
prove Desertors or Adulterers.</p>
            <p>2. And the people that are excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:99576:67"/>
or forbidden to worship God publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
unless they will do that which they think
is sin, are still under Gods command to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him, and not to forsake Church-assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
for his worship. What would you have
these Ministers and People do? They study
and pray to God to convince them, if they
take these Oaths, Subscriptions, Professions
and Practices to be sin, and they be no sin:
They resolve to be ruled by Gods Word:
They are willing to hear any thing that
may better inform them: They wonder
that men accuse them that have no more to
say to change them. If they desert the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
they fear Gods vengeance: If these
poor people give over all Gods Publick
Worship, and live like Atheists, Conscience
living or dying will torment them. If they
do that which they are perswaded is sin,
when the Imposers call it but Indifferent,
<hi>Paul</hi> hath antidated their Sentence; <hi>He that
doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth
not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin,
Rom.</hi> 14. Change their Judgment they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not:
sin they dare not: To give over wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiping
God, is to renounce Salvation:
Change the Law or Canon, men will not.
It seems to me a strange penalty to forbid
men to worship God at all, because they
think some Subscriptions or Forms to be
sin: More strange than to say, <hi>All that will
not wear Crape shall go naked:</hi> Or, <hi>all that will
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:99576:68"/>
not eat Anchovies shall eat nothing.</hi> If a man
think the use of a Crucifix in Worship sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
sure to give over all Worship is more
sinful: But men have their ways.</p>
            <p>3. What Worship is it that they offer
God contrary to Law? They are willing to
do all required in Scripture by Christ and
his Apostles: And were they Rebels and
Rogues? Or is their Worship intolerable?</p>
            <p>4. What harm will it do their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
or any, if they only read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and praise God with Psalms, and preach
and pray as God prescribeth, without Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions
or Ceremonies? Are any hurt
by this? Doth the same Liberty to the
Dutch here hurt any body, or break Peace?
Doth the difference of Cathedral and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
Worship break Peace; or of those
Churches that have Organs and Altars, and
those that have none?</p>
            <p>The Papists are the greatest pretenders
to Unity, and most cry down Schism; and
yet if all will but be Servants to the Pope,
he will License multitudes of Orders that
more differ from one another than we from
you: Jesuits, Benedictines, Dominicans,
Carthusians, and abundance more.</p>
            <p>5. Dare any man of Self-knowledge and
Conscience say, that all your Worship is
not more faulty, than is the omission of a
Form or Ceremony? Will not all the
world be forbidden to worship God, if all as
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:99576:68"/>
bad as this be forbidden? And how many
worshippers of God, think you, will be left
in <hi>England,</hi> if all must give over that have
greater faults than the omission of a thing
called but Indifferent?</p>
            <p>6. As to what you talk of <hi>Passive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi>
though the phrase be a contradiction,
yet the thing meant is a meer cheat of one
that hath devised that absurd phrase: And
calls <hi>Omissive Obedience</hi> by the name of <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive;
Omitting</hi> an Action is not suffering. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
was forbid to pray, and the Apostles to
preach: They would not yield this <hi>Omissive</hi>
Obedience, but they yielded that which is
commonly called <hi>Passive.</hi> They patiently
suffered.</p>
            <p>7. Do you not know that about two
hundred thousand in and near <hi>London</hi> cannot
come within the doors of the Parish-Churches,
(nor hundreds hear that can croud
in;) shall all these be made Atheists, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for Rebels if they will not forbear to
worship God?</p>
            <p>8. I suppose you know that many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
stay at home in their Houses, Shops,
Taverns, in sin or idleness: Are these
thought worthy of a Jail or Banishment?
Or is their course better than to worship
God as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> did? O the difference
between Gods Judgment and some mens!
But Gods Judgment shall determine all.</p>
            <p>9. Are there no unfaithful and unskilful
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:99576:69"/>
Ministers? Will no Patrons chuse such? Is
not the Ministers skill and faithfulness of
great importance to mens Salvation? What
if Bishops or Laws imposed an unskilful or
untrusty Physician on you, and forbad you to
chuse a better, would you die obediently,
or rather say, no one hath power so to
betray my life? No nor your Soul nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>10. If you have the hearts of Christians
consider this undeniable consequence: If
you will have no union or concord among
Christians till they agree in all things that are
of no greater weight and evidence, than your
forms and ceremonies are, you would have
no concord in the world, no not between any
two persons: And you may as well say, none
shall be endured that are not just of the same
visage and complexion: And then all the
doubt will be, who is the man that will be
the strongest and longest liver, to possess all
<hi>England</hi> himself alone.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Accus.</hi> But they shew that they are Perjured,
false, unconscionable Rogues, that took on them to
scruple Oaths and our Church Communion till
now, and now can do all rather than be out of
places of trust.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. As to your Church communion,
can you blind mens eyes, that they shall not
read, what the old Nonconformists have
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:99576:69"/>
written to perswade men to it? See Mr.
<hi>Hildersham, Bradshaw, Gifford, Paget, Ball,</hi>
and abundance more. And did not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Nonconformists shew the same judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
1660 and 1661 in their treaty? And
do not many come to your assemblies? And
would they not all that are Ministers Preach
there if they could have leave? And have
you not, as is afore proved, Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them by your Canons 5, 6, 7, 8. And is
the <hi>Oxford</hi> Act (which imprisoneth them all
six months if they be seen within five miles
of a Corporation or any place where they
have preached within 20 years) an invisible
thing? Do you lay men in Jail by it, and
yet think it must be unknown? And he that
knows it knows that it Sentences all such to
Jail if they be seen in your Churches? And
is it the course of humane converse, to say,
<hi>If you come into any Church within five miles</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>you shall lie in Iail six months; And if
you do not, you are Rogues and shall lie in Iail for
not coming?</hi> Just when the Ministers agreed
to come more frequently than before, this
act came out, and drove them back. You'll
say, <hi>They can appear in their own assemblies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. His Majesty encouraged them by
granting them Liberty by his Declaration.
2. They have more hope there of escap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of your hands, than they have in
your own Churches.</p>
            <p>And do you not see in Print what Mr.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:99576:70"/>
               <hi>Tombes</hi> the Anabaptist wrote long ago to
perswade his followers to your communion?
And what Mr. <hi>Nye</hi> wrote to perswade the
Independants to come to your Churches? what
great change is here of their judgments?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But why did not the people do so all this
while?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Because their own Teachers did, as
they thought, more profit them. Many a man
thinks it lawful to wear rags that yet had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wear whole and comely cloaths; and
lawful to eat brown bread, and drink water,
that will fare better when they can, and yet
take these when they cannot. The people
that had good houses before the fire, did
without any change of their judgments, get
into any poor rooms or cottages after it.</p>
            <p>2. But suppose they lately change their
judgments, (as many no doubt have) you
that think it is for the better are strange
Christians that reproach men for repenting
and amending. Do you call them to Church
and reproach them for not coming, and
seek to ruin them for it, and now accuse
them for coming? Doth not this shew
that some men desired the present Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
not for concord of all, but to drive
some away, lest they should come in, and
the land have concord? And doth not this
shew what men we have to do with; and
that it is somewhat else than non-conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which such men hate? Your Justice is
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:99576:70"/>
               <hi>[Come to Church, or lie in Iail as Schismaticks:
And if you come you are perfidious rogues.]</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they do or do not, all's one to such
judges: who have some other hateful mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in their Eye.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But their doing it just now to keep their
Charter, and keep from suffering, proveth that
they are perfidious Rogues.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. I pray tell men of brains and
sense, for what it is that you would have
men Excommunicated, and laid in Jail or
Fined, if they Conform not? Do you do
all this without any purpose or hope to
drive them to conformity? And do you do it
only to make them <hi>perfidious Rogues.</hi> If suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
may not alter them, why do you use it
on them?</p>
            <p>2. But who knows not that some things
are lawful to avoid suffering which else
would not be lawful. It is lawful to cast
your goods into the Sea to save the Ship and
mens lives; Which else were a sin: It's law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to give a Thief your purse to save your
life, which else were unlawful: It's lawful
to blow up neighbours houses to stop a fire;
Christ proved it lawful to break the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
in cases of necessity; he withdrew into
the Wilderness and far from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to
avoid the pharisees persecution. And <hi>Paul</hi>
was let down by the Wall in a basket;
Which without danger of suffering, had not
been lawful: Though no sin must be done
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:99576:71"/>
to avoid suffering, yet that may and must be
done, which self-preservation makes no sin,
but a duty; To kill a man that assaults you
in your own defence is not the same crime
as unnecessarily to kill him.</p>
            <p>But as to the other case of taking the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
Oath and Declaration, if you know
the case (as you should do before you accuse
men) you know that it is the true sence of
them that is all the controversy: No body
scruples swearing Loyalty, and renouncing
Rebellion and Sedition, and all unlawful
means of reformation: That which makes
it difficult is that on one side, the proper
universal sence of the words seems to them
unlawful, and Oaths must be taken in the
usual sence, unless our Rulers give another,
yet on the other side, learned, sober Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists
profess that they take such words in
the limited sence, or else they would not
take them; And they argue subtilly to
prove that to be the true sence; And our
Law-makers to whom it belongs will not
end the controversy by an exposition. And
can you wonder here if men fluctuate in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty?
And a late writer having given
subtiler arguments for the limited sence than
were published before, did perswade many:
And in that limited sence twenty Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formist
Ministers took the oath long ago
in <hi>London</hi> at one time.</p>
            <p>But I justify none that mistake in so
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:99576:71"/>
great a matter. And doubtless if they sinned
God will not bless it to their good; It will
prove their snare: And I am glad that we
are agreed that Perjury is a heinous sin: I
beseech you then to consider, 1. Whether
those men are fit to accuse them who drive
them to it, and say to Ministers, <hi>Swear or lye
in Iail:</hi> 2. Or those who are of the mind of
<hi>Grotius,</hi> Bishop <hi>Taylor</hi> and such others, that
Lying is Lawful when it saves our selves,
and wrongs no other: And of those Divines
that say, It's as lawful to defend my self from
pernicious Imposers with my tongue as with
my hands.</p>
            <p>3. Let us all with fear (who believe
there is a God) avoid the dreadful crime of
perjuring the whole land. This whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is sworn against all <hi>Forreign Iurisdiction</hi>
in the Oath of Supremacy; and against all
endeavours to <hi>alter the Government of Church
or State,</hi> by 1. the Corporation Act, 2. The
Vestry Act, 3. The <hi>Militia</hi> Act, 4. The
<hi>Oxford</hi> of Confinement. 5. And obliged by
the Act of Uniformity. Is it not perjury
than to endeavour any alteration of it?
1. What shall we then think of them that
would bring in Popery? would they not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
the Kingdom? 2. What shall we say of
them that write for a Forreign Church Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,
under the name of General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
or a Colledge of Bishops, or of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Patriarchs, of whom the Pope is chief,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:99576:72"/>
and the <hi>Principium unitatis,</hi> to the universal
Church. Is it no change of our Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
to bring us under a forreign Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction?
Is it no change of State Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to make the King and Kingdom, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to that forreign Jurisdiction, who may
excommunicate him, and so bring on him
all the evil which Excommunication infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth?
And what man in his wits knoweth
not that Prelates and Priests are much at
the will and power of the Princes under
whom they live? Doth not our King expect
that his Bishops obey him? And those that
must have this Universal Jurisdiction over
our King and us, are the Subjects of other
Princes, of which the far greatest part are
Papists, Mahometans, Infidels, Heathens, or
such as are called Hereticks; And if our
King and we be made Subject to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of the Turk, the Pope, the Kings of
<hi>Spain, France, Poland,</hi> the Emperor, the
<hi>Moscovite,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Bavaria, Tuscany,</hi>
and such like, is he not made a Subject
to their Lords and Masters, and much
worse? Will not this project perjure <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Whether it be any alteration of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
by them that would change the
Power and use of Parliaments, I leave to
Lawyers.</p>
            <p>4. But I would fain be satisfied of another
case. These Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:99576:72"/>
took a Covenant and Vow, some Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily,
some at their Compositions, who
had been sequestred for the King: This Vow
contained divers matters, of which some are
notorious duties, as to repent of their sins,
to oppose Popery, Schism, and Prophaneness,
to defend the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It's not denied by
most that I meet with, that this Oath or
Vow was unlawfully imposed, and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
taken, and many think some of the
matter was unlawful, <hi>viz.</hi> to oppose Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But seeing Casuists are agreed, that
an Oath unlawfully both imposed and taken,
bindeth to that part of the <hi>matter</hi> which is
lawful and necessary, notwithstanding the
Conjunction of the rest. And the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>England</hi> are all formed by a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
taken by all in power and trust, that
<hi>[There is no Obligation,</hi> (without the least
exception) <hi>on me or any other person from the
Oath called the Solemn League and Covenant;</hi>
The doubt is whether every man may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that, of all the thousands of three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
(whom he never knew,) no one is
bound by that Oath, or Vow, to repent of
his sins, or in his place and calling to oppose
Schism, Popery, or Prophaneness, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the King? and whether all may declare
that the <hi>Londoners</hi> and Ministers, and the
restored old Parliament, and General <hi>Monks</hi>
Army who restored the King, as supposing
they were bound to it by that Oath, were
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:99576:73"/>
all deceived, and were under no such obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
thence? And whether I am not
bound in charity to think that the sequestred
Royalists put a good sence on it, when they
took it? And so whether all the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>England</hi> are free from—And for
what it is that God hath singled them out for
Judgment?</p>
            <p>If you be agreed with us (and with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king)
against so great a sin as Perjury, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
national, let us help one another with
Love and Patience to resolve such doubts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Accus.</hi> But they have been guilty of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
in a Civil War, and therefore are justly
suspected to Preach or hold Rebellious Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1 Are those men lovers of Love
and Concord who purposely make use of
pardoned acts to keep the Kingdoms wounds
still open? Did not the King tell you in
his Declarations and Act of Oblivion, that
the putting up of all (save to the excepted
persons) and closing for the future in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
love, was the only way to the Nations
peace? You would tempt men to think that
you desire to see such days again, by trying
whether destroying men will tempt nature to
a self-defence.</p>
            <p>2. But you have oft had it proved (by
<hi>Henry Fowlis,</hi> Bishop <hi>Barlow</hi> and abundance
more) that no Protestants come near the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:99576:73"/>
Principles and Practices of the Papists, as to
King-killing and Rebellion. And if yet you
know not that the War began between two
parties of Episcopal conformists, here among
the English, you are unfit to judge of that
which you know not: And by reading <hi>Rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,
Whitlock</hi> or any true Histories of such
times and matters, you may be better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed:
As you may of their different
principles if you read <hi>Iewel,</hi> Bishop <hi>Bilson,</hi>
and <hi>Richard Hooker</hi> on one side, and <hi>Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warning</hi>
and <hi>Sibthorp</hi> on the other.</p>
            <p>3. But how few men are alive that had
any hand in those miserable Wars? You
have oft been offered a thousand thanks if
you will silence and hunt no other that are
as innocent as you, and more than many of
of their accusers. And shall thousands suffer
for other mens deeds? 3. What will wise
men think of such a sort of men, as charge
multitudes in general with Rebellious and
Seditious Doctrine, and have accused so few
of any such these twenty years, that I know
not of one publickly Accused, Tryed and
Proved guilty, of all called Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
in all this Land? If they are guilty prove
it, and let the guilty suffer, and not the
innocent: Only had I my wish I would
Bar Perjury, and Condemning men unheard.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Accus.</hi> They are an unpeaceable sort of people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> That's soon said. Who hath these
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:99576:74"/>
22 two years manifested most desires of
Peace? They that have beg'd for it again
and again: Pleaded and written for it:
Offered their Oaths that they would obey
any lawful Commands for it, and do any
thing which they did not believe that God
forbids? Or those Bishops that would not
have one Form or Ceremony, or needless
Subscription forborn, to save thousands of
Ministers from being silenced and laid in
Common jails, nor to save many thousand
of the people from suffering, and to heal the
divisions of the Church. One would think
this should be as easie a Controversy, as when
Soldiers are plundering the Country, and the
people on their knees intreating for their
goods and lives, to determine which of them
is most against War.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Accus.</hi> But what need they make such a stir
with their Religion: What need they any more
than go to Church and live obediently and be
quiet? Why will they be righteous over much; will
not less ado bring men to Heaven? Why do they
differ from their Neighbours, and judge all car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
that be not as Scrupulous as they? God is
merciful; and will he save none but Puritans, or
precise zealots?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Now you come to the real matter
of your distast: I did not meddle with the
case of Nonconformity as it is a Controversy
between Godly men, but only as you make
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:99576:74"/>
a pretence of it, to exercise your enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
serious Godliness, and a handle to lay
hold on many whom Christ will justify and
save. To all before said I add,</p>
            <p>1. If you think they do too much, search
the Scriptures, and see whether it be not less
than God commandeth? And if so, is it
not God whom you accuse and reproach?</p>
            <p>2. If they do too much in obeying God,
why do Canon-makers impose such abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
on them, as if God had not imposed
enough?</p>
            <p>3. Why do you never find fault with
men for being too strong, too healthful, too
rich, too great, but only for being too obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to God? When Christ saith; If we
did all that God commandeth we must say,
we are unprofitable Servants, we have done
no more than was our duty, and the best on
Earth come short of duty. But this which is
the Core I answered before. And conclude,
that all that be in their right wits can easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
bear all your accusations and persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of us, as if we did too much in obedience
to God, than the accusation of Conscience
and the displeasure of God for doing too
little: Which alas when we have done our
best would sink us into despair, had we not
the merits of Christs suffering and perfect
righteousness to trust to.</p>

            <head>Chap. V. An humble Expostulation with
the English Papists who by Information
and Prosecution seek our ruine.</head>
            <p>THough it be not Popery as such that I
am here reasoning against, the course
that many Papists take in seeking our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
giveth me cause of this humble ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulation:
And I speak now of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but of them. I mean, 1. Those that
write so hotly and ragingly to provoke Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors
to ruine us. 2. Those that make a
trade of being delators against us for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiping
God as we do. 3. Those of them
that break in upon us with greatest haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness
and fury, to take away all our goods,
and seek our imprisonment. 4. Those
that seek to ruine us by those Laws which
were made against themselves. 5. Those
that would make Superiors believe that our
Doctrine is more rebellious than theirs. To
these I offer a few modest questions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 1. There are some among you that
profess great Spirituality and strictness in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
<hi>Serenus Cressy</hi> wrote to me (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
<hi>Baker</hi>'s book which he published)
that he forsook the Church of <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he found no Spiritual contemplation
and devotion among us. Such as <hi>Nerius, Sales,
Kempis, Gerson Borromaeus, Renti, &amp;c.</hi> are real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the chief honour of your Church. Much of
that for which I am hated by the Enemies of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:99576:75"/>
               <hi>serious godliness,</hi> I acknowledge to Gods praise,
I was first chiefly awakened to by a book
written by one whom <hi>Watson,</hi> and others of
your party grievously accuse, I mean Parsons
Book of Resolution corrected by <hi>Bunny.</hi>
True Christianity and Godliness is the same
thing in all that have it. Your Priest Mr.
<hi>Hutchinson, alias Berry,</hi> writeth that the most
of serious Godliness among Protestants is
found among those called Puritans: So that
I was fain to defend the Conformists against
his charge: All this being so, is it the Spirit
of God that engageth and enrageth you with
the most destructive bitterness against those
men whom you confess to be the most Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
meerly because they are stiffest against
your Church Government and way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship?
And do you not know that it tendeth
more sensibly than disputes, to perswade the
people whom you thus hate and prosecute,
that your Religion is malignant, and enmity
to real Godliness?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. Do you think it is prudent for you,
as soon as ever you get up and before you
dare openly own your name and cause, to
begin with Malice, Rage and Cruelty, and
that against the most religious (as you say?)
Will not this perswade the people that all is
true that is said of your intended cruelty, and
make them fear you, as so many Leopards
or Wolves? Will they not say, if the young
Serpents can so easily sting, what will the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:99576:76"/>
old ones do? And if your infancy here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with such destructive zeal, what will you
do when you are at full growth?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 3. You cannot be ignorant what
cause to accuse your Church with Cruelty
and Blood, hath been given the world by
your Church Laws and Practices: By the
Council at the <hi>Laterane</hi> under <hi>Innocent 3d</hi>
the Council for damning Henrician Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
even Kings that claim Investiture of
Bishops, and those that decree the burning
of all that you call Hereticks: By the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of so many thousand <hi>Albigenses, Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Bohemians,</hi> &amp;c. By the Inquisitions more
inhumane cruelties in <hi>Belgium</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> &amp;c.
By the Massacres in <hi>France,</hi> and the murder
of <hi>Henry</hi> III. and IV. By Queen <hi>Maries</hi>
flames; By the two hundred thousand mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in <hi>Ireland:</hi> And there be many among
you who disown all this, and say it is not
from the principles of your Religion (when
yet General Councils approved are your
Religion it self.) This being copiously
opened (as I said before by <hi>Henry Fowlis,</hi>
Bishop <hi>Barlow,</hi> &amp;c.) had it not been more
prudent for you to have begun with Lenity
and Love, to have drawn men to think that
you are better minded, than to perswade
them that you are of your rulers and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
mind, and mean to imitate them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 4. Have you not observed that all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
have faln by forcing multitudes to be
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:99576:76"/>
their enemies by seeking to destroy or hurt
them? Most men love quietness, and will
live in peace, if others will give them leave:
But when they see that they must offend o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
or not defend themselves, it sets all
their wit and power on work against their
intolerable enemies: There are few crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in the world that have not some power
and inclination to hurt others for their own
defence. The Bee hath a Sting to defend
her Hive and Honey. And do you not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that your sufferings in <hi>England</hi> came
most by Queen <hi>Maries</hi> flames, and the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
Invasion, and the many Treasons against
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and by the Powder Plot?
And how the <hi>French</hi> Massacre and Murders
of Kings, and the horrid Inquisition set all
our Parliaments against you? And how the
Murder of 200000 in <hi>Ireland</hi> drove many
thousands into the Parliaments Army that
else would not have gone? And will you yet
stir up all the Land to fear and hate you?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 5. Is it not both imprudent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
for you of all men to turn those
Laws against us, which were made against
you, and have so much slept, and little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
you? You will by this call people to
take notice of them, that did not before.
For my own part, as I never hurt any of
you, so I know not that any of the Ministers
did, whose ruine you endeavour. We hear
of none of your sufferings by any such. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:99576:77"/>
these late years many have died as for
the Plot so much talkt of. But by whom
did they die? Was it not by the accusation
and witness of Papists? Were not <hi>Oats, Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
Dugdale, Turbervile, Prance, Dangerfield,
Ienison, Smith, alias Barry,</hi> the York-shire
Witnesses, and the rest besides the Irish, all
men of your selves, that came out of your
own Bosoms? whether the men died justly or
unjustly I leave to God; But sure it was men
of your own selves that did it. And will you
be revenged for this on such Protestants that
medled not in it?</p>
            <p>And you should remember that you and
we have a Protestant King, who hath sworn
all his Kingdom against all forreign juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
and all endeavour of any alteration
of Government in Church or state, and so
much abhors Popery that he hath made a
law severely to punish all that shall but raise
any suspicion that he is a Papist. And you
must in reason take heed of dishonouring
and defaming him, by defaming Protestants
in general.</p>
            <p>And sure since Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> days we
have had no Kings whom you can justly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
of cruelty towards you. No not King
<hi>Iames</hi> when the Powder Plot had provoked
him; if half be true that the Bishop of <hi>Ambrun</hi>
saith of his conference with him, or that
<hi>Rushworth</hi> and others say of the Oath of the
King, Prince and Council for Toleration,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:99576:77"/>
you are disingenuous if you accuse them of
cruelty or rigorous severity.</p>
            <p>In you <hi>Philanax Anglicus</hi> (as formerly in
the <hi>Image of both Churches)</hi> you make all cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Protestants</hi> of <hi>sincerity,</hi> to be of Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
principles, and their Religion introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by it; and yet profess that you honour the
King, as if you would have men doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be a <hi>Protestant</hi> of <hi>sincerity,</hi> or else
were as bad as you describe. Had the severe
Laws been executed against you, especially
for meer Religion, no one could wonder if
you desired relief: But while you live quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and Words and Paper hurt you not (that I
hear of) to begin with so much hurtfulness
to them that medled not with you, will
disserve your cause.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu. 6. And is</hi> it consistent with reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
modesty to go about to make the
World believe that the Protestant Doctrine
is less loyal than yours? Do you think your
Books are invisible, &amp; all your practices for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten:
It is none of the business of this writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to accuse you herein, of any thing but
falsly accusing others, and seeking to destroy
us on such accusation. Though you may thus
deceive the ignorant that know no more of
you than what you tell them, that will but
turn to your dishonour at last. Are not your
foresaid Council Canons which are your
Religion, visible? Have not the forecited
writers truly cited them and multitudes of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:99576:78"/>
your Doctors which may better inform men?
Are all the Wars of <hi>Italy, Germany,</hi> &amp;c. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Princes and Emperors, for the Pope,
forgotten? Was it not a Council of your
Bishops that decreed that all the carcasses of
those Bishops that were for the <hi>Henrician</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy
(that is, for the Emperors power of
investing Bishops and his exemption from
being excommunicated and deposed by the
Pope) should be digged out of their Graves,
and Burnt? Was it not a council that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<hi>Ludovicus Pius?</hi> How many more such
acts have they done? And are not your most
learned Doctors allowed to publish the justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the Popes power to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
&amp; depose Kings if they deserve it (in his
judgment?) Do not your politick Writers,
Casuists and Divines ordinarily hold that the
people give Kings, their power, and may take
it away when they forfeit it, and that tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
is such a forfeiture? And that the people
should not suffer a Heretick to reign? And
that subjects may be absolved from their
Oaths of Allegiance, according to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
<hi>Laterane</hi> and <hi>Greg.</hi> 7. Roman Councils?
But too much is said of this by many, and the
case is past a modest denial.</p>
            <p>Even those Protestants that were in Arms
for the Parliament, and restored the King,
were so far from thinking that their Oaths
of Allegiance may be dispensed with, that if
I knew any thing of those men and times, it
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:99576:78"/>
was principally the Conscience of two Oaths
(the Oath of Allegeance, and the Oath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Covenant) that by them overcame
the opposition of the other Army, and brought
home the King. It was this that engaged the
Ministers of <hi>England</hi> against both <hi>Cromwel</hi>
and a Common-wealth: and the Ministers
were followed by most of the religious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the land, which broke the adversaries
strength: It was this that engaged the exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
members of the (then) long Parliament:
It was this that engaged the City of <hi>London:</hi>
It seems it was this that engaged Gen. <hi>Monk</hi>'s
Army, when they say in their address to him,
(see it, in <hi>Englands Triumph</hi> for K. <hi>Charles</hi> the
2d <hi>p.</hi> 85.) <q>[<hi>We hope to evince to his Majesty
and all the world, that we and all those that
have been engaged in the Parliaments cause,
are his Majesties best and most real subjects;
and that your Excellency and the Armies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your command, have complied with the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
for which they were first raised, for
the preservation of the true Protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the Honour and Dignity of the King, the
Priviledges of Parliament, the Liberty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of the Subjects, and the Fundamental
Laws of the land.]</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I am not justifying all that I recite; I doubt
not but they were much mistaken. But if they
had then been told that shortly <hi>all the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
Offices</hi> and <hi>Trusts</hi> in <hi>England</hi> shall be
constituted by a personal Declaration of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:99576:79"/>
every one, that <hi>[There is no obligation on any
person from the Oath called the Solemn Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant]</hi>
to restore the King, oppose Schism, or
to any thing whatever, the effect would have
been such, as makes me wonder that the
Royalists (as then called) should be very
eager to make all such declare, that all these
Souldiers, Ministers, Parliament and Citizens
that restored the King as bound to it by that
Oath, were therein mistaken, and no such
obligation thence was on them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 7. I need not name to you the sorry
fellows out of the Jails, where they lay for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human
villanies that have been our zealous,
ranting, tearing, prosecuters? And do you
think such actors are an honour to your
cause? If it be good, use good men in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 8. Why do you play your game under
board, and behind the Curtain? If you are
not ashamed of your cause, openly own it. Is
falshood, lying and dissembling beseeming
them that say they are of a Church out of
which none can be saved? I remember when
<hi>Terret, alias Iohnson,</hi> had seduced the eldest
Daughter of the Countess of <hi>Balcarres</hi> (whom
they stole away and made a Nun in <hi>France,)</hi>
and she was after askt, why she did so long
go to our Churches, join in family worship,
read Protestant Books, and talk against the
Papists, and deride them, after she was a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist
her self, she answered that they had leave
to do all that as long as they did not openly
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:99576:79"/>
Profess their Religion, and were not detected.
But when once they were discovered and
openly professed themselves Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
they must then suffer any thing rather
than conform to us.</p>
            <p>Gods cause needeth not such jugling and
lying.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 9. Why do you not ingenuously plead
your cause against us, so as may satisfy an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
Conscience, before you seek our
destruction? 1. Your arguings are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fitted only to cheat the ignorant by am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguities,
and confusion, and equivocal terms;
Your queries or methods to the French suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers,
are only a formed cheat, by confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
1. Subjection to Governours, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with neighbour Churches. 2. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with your Church in Christianity and
Communion with its sins. 3. A Catholick
Church informed only by the soveraignty of
Christ, and a pretended universal Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by the soveraignty of Man (a Monarch
or a Church-Parliament.) 4. The office of
keeping, delivering and teaching men Gods
Laws, and an absolute power to Judge of their
sence, and to make more as a supplement to
their defects, obliging all the world on pain
of Excommunication and Death: And more
such.</p>
            <p>2. Any writings which undeniably open
your frauds, you take no notice of, nor vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
to answer upon the importunity of Mr.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:99576:80"/>
               <hi>Iohnson,</hi> and divers others; I have lately
written; 1. A reply to <hi>Iohnson.</hi> 2. A small
book in answer to one of your Papers, to
<hi>prove that we have a certainty of Christianity
without Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. In answer to another, a small Book
called, <hi>Full and Easy satisfaction which is the
true Religion.</hi> None of them will you answer,
nor those before written: But instead of a
sober investigation of the truth, some of you
raise odious slanders of my life, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
and seek my destruction. I never hurt
any of you, as I said before, nor ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
any to severity against you. I have
long ago publickly proposed terms on which
we might live together as neighbours in
peace. But destruction and misery are in
your way (that I have observed) and the
way of peace you have not known.</p>
            <p>There are three things which alienate
common Christians from you more than all
other disputes. 1. That you can go so open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
against the plainest words of God (as in
blotting out the Second Commandment, in
notorious contradicting 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. and <hi>Rom.
14,</hi> and 15. about the terms of Church Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Communion; about Latin Prayers
and Worship to the ignorant, denying the
Cup to the Laity, denying sense in Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation).</p>
            <p>2. That you befriend Ignorance so much,
by the said Latin Worship, forbidding most
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:99576:80"/>
to read the Scripture translated, and accuse
Gods Spirit of writing obscurely, to cover
this.</p>
            <p>3. That your Religion liveth by cruelty
and blood, and cannot stand without it:
Which at least in prudence you should hide
as long as you can; Or at least not design to
make the ignorant and vicious Protestants,
your Proselytes and Agents conjunctly to
ruin those whom your Consciences know
to be the most Consciencious and seriously
religious.</p>
            <p>By which already the flock of Christ do
(under your Sheeps cloathings) so judge of
you by your fruites, that if any man that is
called a Protestant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Clergy-man, do but
Write and Preach for cruelty and ruin to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
serious Conscionable Christians, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
by this very mark do presently suspect
that he is either a Papist or so near them as
that he is ready to pass over to them, whom
he so assisteth in destructive work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> What must be the cure of Maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> When the heel of the holy seed is
sufficiently bruised, the Serpents Head must
be broken. 1. The War in Heaven which
formerly cast down the Dragon, must break
the supream Serpentine Head. II. Then
his Heads military on Earth will be broken.
I. The usurping universal Head called Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical:
II. The national Serpentine
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:99576:81"/>
Heads. I. Exterior; Mahometan and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.
II. Interior; called falsly Christian:
I. Serpentine Monarchs, that War against
Christ. II. Serpentine Prelates and their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons,
that fight against Christ as in his own
name, and by his pretended commission.</p>
            <p>And all this by Christ, and not by sinful
means.</p>
            <p>Reformation is begun <hi>à Minoritis</hi> at the
lowest, for personal Salvation of the Elect:
But a <hi>Majoritis,</hi> at the <hi>Heads</hi> for publick
welfare: And God must raise Reforming
Princes and Pastors to that end.</p>
