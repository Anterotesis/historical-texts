            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PROPOSALS TO The Honourable Houſe of Commons, Humbly offered and preſented, for the Laying <hi>A Tax upon Raw Hides, &amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <byline>By <hi>RICHARD ORGAN.</hi>
            </byline>
            <p n="1">I. THE ſaid <hi>Richard Organ,</hi> Humbly Propoſes that a Duty be laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Raw-Hides, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not upon Tann'd Leather, becauſe the Charges in Collecting the ſaid Duty will be leſs, and the Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Fell-Mongers will be only, or chiefly concern'd to pay it, who have long ſince raiſed their Commodities, upon hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Tax would be laid upon them, as much as if ſuch Tax were already laid: And by this means ſome of them have got conſiderable Eſtates.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That the Duty to be laid upon Raw-Hides, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> continue as long as that of the Hackney Coaches, and that the Duty to be laid upon Soap be joyn'd with it, which will be a Fund for a Million and an half of Mony, and that the Duties be as follows:</p>
            <p n="3">III. Every Cow, Ox, Bull, Steer and Heifer Hide, fold under 20 <hi>s.</hi> or for 20 <hi>s.</hi> and no more, to any Tanner or Fell-Monger, 2 <hi>s.</hi> Duty ſhall be paid to the King by ſuch Tanner or Fell-Monger, or other Perſon who ſhall buy the ſame; and all ſuch Hides as come to more than Twenty Shillings, Three Shillings Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhall be laid upon them.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Every Calves Skin Sixpence Duty, every Sheeps Skin a Penny, every Lambs Skin a Halfpenny.</p>
            <p n="5">V. All Bucks Skins, Goat Skins, and all Foreign Leather to be Tax'd as ſhall to the Honourable Houſe appear moſt fit and convenient.</p>
            <p>That in order to Collect this Duty there be an Office appointed at <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-Hall,</hi> and that Two Pence <hi>per</hi> Pound be allowed to the ſeveral Collectors, and One Penny <hi>per</hi> Pound to the Receiver General; and that this Office extend to all Places within the Bills of Mortality.</p>
            <p>That this Duty be Collected in all other Parts and Places of this Kingdom, by the Clerk of the ſeveral Markets, with the Allowances aforeſaid; and that an Office be appointed in every City, to receive ſuch Monies by them Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
            <p>That all Hides, Skins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo bought be entred, and a Penalty as this Honourable Houſe ſhall think ſit, be laid upon all Perſons who ſhall buy ſuch Raw-Hides, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without entring the ſame, and Paying the Duties aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>The Benefit of ſuch Duties may appear by this, that there are great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Leather Exported, and particularly Calves Skins. The King hath but a Shilling Duty for every Hundred Weight of them now, but hereby the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will ariſe to Six Shillings a Dozen.</p>
