            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER WRITTEN FROM OXFORD BY M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Stephen Colledge To his Friends in <hi>LONDON,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <head type="sub">Writen by himſelf, Immediately after his Condemnation.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Believe you are in pain (and well you may be ſo) to have a juſt account of this my ſecond Expedition to <hi>Oxford;</hi> which proves indeed ſo little to my Satisfaction, that I am afraid it will not prove much to yours: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever conſidering that Suſpenſe and Anxiety are ſo very near of Kin to real and preſent Evils, and that my Story muſt needs at laſt come to your Hands, though by other means; I have thought fit to write it my ſelf, and acquaint you with ſome things, which being well and ſeaſonably weigh'd, may (I hope) have a particular influence upon your future Conduct and Succeſs.</p>
            <p>On the way thither it was my Fortune to encounter a Gentleman and his man: When we came cloſe together, ſays the Gentleman to his Servant, Ride on you Dogg, for here's ſuch a Stink would poiſon the Devil. As ſoon as they were paſt, I could hear the man ask his Maſter, what that Company might be, or what they carry'd that Stunck ſo? To whom his Maſter reply'd, that they were well-wiſhers to the <hi>Colledges,</hi> and were carrying that tall Gentleman there to the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity.</hi> What to do, ſays the man? For in my mind he looks as if he were too old to Learn. Away, away, <hi>Robin,</hi> ſays his Maſter, doſt not thou remember the Old Proverb, <hi>Live and Learn.</hi> Ay Maſter, ſays the man again, <hi>But the Latter-end is, be Hang'd and forget all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I Arriv'd at <hi>Oxford,</hi> I found all the Streets, Windows and Balconies fill'd, as if it had been at a Coronation. I believe if I had but a Shilling from every body that ask'd, <hi>Which is He?</hi> I might with more reaſon then I could ever hither pretend to, leave off <hi>Joyning</hi> and turn <hi>Stateſman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Methought at firſt, it look'd Great, and I was well enough pleas'd with their pointing: But when I conſidered the occaſion, and remember'd that men might be much talk'd of, that were no Saints, I fell into a deep fit of Melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for fear that after-Ages ſhould mention me with <hi>Heroſtratus</hi> the <hi>Epheſian Diſſenter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among other Paſſages, I took notice of an Old Country-Fellow, which had his Basket of Eggs broke all to pieces in the Crowd; <hi>That wiſh'd heartily I had been Hang'd the laſt time I was there:</hi> And a Rogue of a Bed-maker to ſome of the Colledges that ſtood by, anſwer'd him in two words, which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve was half the <hi>Latine</hi> he had, <hi>Nunquam ſera,</hi> that is to ſay, (ſays he) <hi>All in good time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Ladies were all very Fine, and I believe had moſt of them their Beſt Cloaths on; and I could not perceive above two or three Mourning Gowns among all that Throng of Students.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98755:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
There were ſome that Shook their Heads, ſome cry'd 'twas Pity, and ſome ſaid it was a Proper Fellow, and became a Horſe well; to which a Hopeful Youth, with a little Bit of Red-Ribband in his Hat, reply'd, (what e're he meant by it) <hi>I hope ſhortly to ſee him become one better.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was an Honeſt Stoick, that had ſeen me there the laſt Parliament upon my Charging Horſe, and conſidering earneſtly my preſent Equipage cry'd out pretty Loud, and with a great aſtoniſhment, <hi>Quantum mutatus?</hi> Which the next to him (who I dare Swear was no <hi>Whig)</hi> made this <hi>Engliſh</hi> of it; <hi>So fare all that hate us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As ſoon as I Lighted from my Horſe, (as if Fate had reſolv'd to purſue the Humour) I was Conducted to one of the Strongeſt and Secureſt Lodgings in the City, and whither ſhe will have me next, God knows, but I am of Opinion I ſhall go near to ſtay there, almoſt as long as I live.</p>
            <p>And yet I may tell you that I am not ſuch a retir'd <hi>Anchorite,</hi> but that I Viſit the <hi>Great-Hall</hi> now and then, and am as much look'd upon, as any man there.</p>
            <p>One day I would fain have made them a Set Speech, but the Auditors had no Patience, but minded me of ſome other little Trivial buſineſs, I had there to do; and urg'd me to leave that to the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity</hi> Orator.</p>
            <p>But now methinks it begins to be time to be in good Earneſt, and in this Humour let me adviſe all thoſe that love the <hi>Good Old Cauſe,</hi> and <hi>Stephen Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> to continue Firm and Obſtinate in their Opinion, and ſtand by it with their Lives and Fortunes, which for ought I can ſee, I am like to do very ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, even in the Literal Senſe.</p>
            <p>For not to Mince the matter with you, I think I ſhall ſhortly be Tranſlated into the number of he <hi>Child-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nborn-Martyrs;</hi> for which I would have you ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prepare then Grieve, always having before your Eyes the old Motto,
<q>Hodie mihi Cras tibi.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To give you then in two words an account of a long buſineſs, which I know you have no Mind to hear: I have had a very Fair Tryal (as they ſay;) But I found my Jury here ſo different from that in <hi>London,</hi> that I cannot find that they agree in any thing in the World, but only in the Name.</p>
            <p>There is here and there they tell me a <hi>Cenſurer,</hi> that thinks thoſe Gentlemen knew too <hi>Little;</hi> but I am ſure theſe know too <hi>Much.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot for my Life tell, where the Secret Lyes; whether it be in the Air, or in the Soyl, or in the Will, or in the Underſtanding; but certain it is (I ſpeak it with Grief) that an <hi>Oxford</hi> Jury have made a ſhift in a little time, and with little Trouble, to find a Bill againſt me (as Dead-doing as that of a Watchman's after midnight) which a <hi>London</hi> Jury could not for their Lives tell where to look for.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, receive my Laſt Salutes with as upright and good Hearts, as I ſend them, and tell Mr. <hi>J—y,</hi> that if it were in my Power to appoint, no body ſhould have leave to Print my Story but Himſelf, as well for His ſake, as my own: For if any ſuch Fellow as <hi>N. T.</hi> ſhould Tranſmit my Memory to Poſterity, I ſhall ſcarce be Nam'd twice in a Page, without the Appellation of Traytor.</p>
            <p>And now Gentlemen to make an end, whatever the Law ſays, (for I know you look not much upon the Dead Letter) I hope you will believe that I Die like a <hi>Good Proteſtant,</hi> and an <hi>Honeſt-Common-Wealths-Man,</hi> and that for this only reaſon, that when the Caſe comes to be your own, Charity may think her ſelf bound in Honour oblig'd to find ſome, that may then believe well of you, as you (in deſpite of <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon)</hi> do now of the</p>
