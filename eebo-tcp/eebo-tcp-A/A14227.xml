            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Thus this matter lay dead for diuers yeeres to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: and so would still have done, but that some of high place in both Kingdomes, having beene pleased to thinke farre better of that little which I had done than the thing deserved, advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed me to goe forward, and to deliver the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Antiquitie touching those particular points in controversie, wherein the Challenger was so confident that the whole current of the Doctors, Pastors and Fathers of the Primitiue Church did mainly run on his side. Hereupon I gathered my scattered notes together, and as the multitude of my imployments would give mee leave, now entred into the handling of one point and then of another: treating of each, either more briefly or more largely, as the opportunitie of my present leisure would give me leave. And so at last, after many interruptions, I have made up in such manner as thou seest, a kinde of a <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinall
<pb facs="tcp:19547:8"/>
History</hi> of those seuerall points, which the Iesuite culled out, as speciall instances of the consonancie of the doctrine now maintained in the Church of Rome, with the perpetuall and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant iudgement of all Antiquitie.</p>
            <p>The doctrine that here I take upon me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, (what different opinions soever I relate of others) is that which by publike authoritie is professed in the Church of England, and compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the booke of <hi>Articles</hi> agreed upon in the Synod held at <hi>LONDON</hi> in the yeere <hi>1562.</hi> concerning which I dare be bold to challenge our Challenger and all his complices, that they shall never be able to prove, that there is either any one article of Religion disallowed therein, which <hi>the Saints and Fathers of the Primitive Church did generally hold to be true,</hi> (I use the words of my challenging Iesuit) or any one point of doctrine <hi>allowed,</hi> which by those Saints and Fathers was generally held to be <hi>untrue.</hi> As for the testimonies of the Authors which I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage, I have beene carefull to set downe in the margent their owne words in their owne language (such places of the <hi>Greeke</hi> Doctors only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whereof the originall text could not be had) as well for the better satisfaction of the Readers (who either cannot come by that variety of
<pb facs="tcp:19547:9"/>
bookes, whereof use is here made, or will not take the paines to enter into a curious search of every particular allegation) as for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of those trifling quarrels that are commonly made against translations. for if it fall out, that word be not everie where precisely rendred by word (as who would tie himselfe to such a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danticall observation?) none but an idle cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler can obiect, that this was done with any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to corrupt the meaning of the Author; whose words he seeth laid downe before his eies, to the end he may the better judge of the translation and rectifie it where there is cause.</p>
            <p>Againe, because it is a thing very materiall in the historicall handling of controversies, both to understand the Times wherein the severall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors lived, and likewise what bookes be truly or falsly ascribed to each of them: for some direction of the Reader in the first, I have annexed at the end of this booke, a <hi>Chronologicall Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi> of the Authors cited therein (wherein such as have no number of yeeres affixed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, are thereby signified to be <hi>Incerti tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>; their age being not found by me, upon this sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den search, to be noted by any:) and for the second, I have seldome neglected in the worke it selfe, whensoever a doubtfull or supposititious writing
<pb facs="tcp:19547:9"/>
was alleaged, to give some intimation whereby it might be discerned that it was not esteemed to be the booke of that Author, unto whom it was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled. The exact discussion as well of the Authors Times, as of the Censures of their workes, I refer to my <hi>Theological Bibliotheque:</hi> if God here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after shall lend me life and leasure, to make up that worke, for the use of those that meane to give themselves to that Noble study of the doctrine and rites of the ancient Church.</p>
            <p>In the meane time I commit this booke to thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable censure, and thy selfe to Gods gracious direction: earnestly advising thee, that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver other studies thou intermittest, the carefull and conscionable reading of Gods booke may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be neglected by thee. for whatsoever becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of our disputes touching other antiquities or novelties: thou maiest stand assured, that thou shalt there finde so much by Gods blessing, as shall be <hi>able to make thee wise unto salvation,</hi>

            <head>THE IESVITES CHALLENGE.</head>
            <head type="sub">How shall I answer to a Papist, demaunding this Question?</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our Doctors and Masters graunt that the Church of Rome for <hi>400</hi> or <hi>500</hi> years after Christ, did hold the true Religion. First then would I faine knowe, what Bishop of Rome did first alter that Religion, which you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend in them of the first <hi>400</hi> years? In what Pope his dayes was the true Religion overthrowne in Rome?</p>
            <p>Next, I would faine know, How can your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion be true, which dissalloweth of many chiefe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, which the Saints and Fathers of that primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church of Rome did generally hold to be true?</p>
            <p>For they of your side, that have read the Fathers
<pb facs="tcp:19547:11"/>
of that unspotted Church, can well testifie (and if any deny it, it shall be presently shewen) that the Doctors, Pastors, and Fathers of that Church doe allow of Traditions; that they acknowledge the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al presence of the body of Christ in the Sacrament of the Altar: that they exhorted the people to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse their sinnes unto their ghostly Fathers: that they affirmed, that Priests have power to forgive sinnes: that they taught, that there is a Purgatory: that prayer for the dead is both commendable and godly: that there is <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> and that our Saviour descended into Hell, to deliver the ancient Fathers of the Old Testament; because before his Passion none ever entred into Heaven: that prayer to Saints, and use of holy Images was of great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count amongst them: that man hath free-will, and that for his meritorious works he receiveth, through the assistance of Gods grace, the blisse of euerlasting happinesse.</p>
            <p>Now would I faine know whether of both haue the true Religion, they that hold all these above said points, with the Primitive Church; or they that doe most vehemently contradict, and gaine-say them? They that doe not disagree with that holy Church, in any point of Religion; or they that agree with it but in very few, and disagree in almost all?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19547:11"/>VVill you say, that these Fathers maintained these opinions, contrary to the word of God? why you know that they were the pillars of Christianitie, the champions of Christ his Church, and of the true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Religion, which they most learnedly defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded against diverse heresies; and therefore spent all their time in a most serious studie of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Or will you say, that although they knew the Scriptures to repugne, yet they brought in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said opinions by malice and corrupt intentions? VVhy your selves cannot deny but that they lived most holy and vertuous lives, free from all maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous corrupting, or perverting of Gods holy word, and by their holy lives are now made worthy to raigne with God in his glory. In so much as their admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble learning may sufficiently crosse out all suspition of ignorant error; and their innocent sanctitie free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us from all mistrust of malitious corruption.</p>
            <p>Now would I willingly see what reasonable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer may be made to this. For the Protestants graunt, that the Church of Rome for <hi>400</hi> or <hi>500</hi> yeares, held the true Religion of Christ: yet do they exclaime against the abovesaid Articles, which the same Church did maintaine and uphold, as may bee shewen by the expresse testimonies of the Fathers of the same Church; and shall be largely laid down,
<pb facs="tcp:19547:12"/>
if any learned Protestant will deny it.</p>
            <p>Yea, which is more, for the confirmation of all the aboue mentioned points of our Religion, wee will produce good and certaine grounds out of the sacred Scriptures, if the Fathers authority will not suffice. And we do desire any Protestant to alleage any one Text out of the said Scripture, which condemneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the aboue written points: which wee hold for certaine they shall never be able to doe. For indeed they are neyther more learned, more pious, nor more holy then the blessed Doctors and Martyrs of that first Church of Rome, which they allow and esteeme of so much, and by which we most willingly will be tryed, in any point which is in controversie betwixt the <hi>Protestants</hi> and the <hi>Catholicks.</hi> VVhich wee desire may be done with christian charity and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, to the glory of God, and instruction of them that are astray.</p>

            <head>AN ANSVVER TO THE FORMER CHALLENGE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O uphold the Religion, which at this day is maintained in the Church of Rome, and to discredit the truth which we professe: three things are here urged, by one who hath vndertaken to make good the Papists cause against all gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers. The first concerneth the originall of the errors wherwith that part standeth charged: the Author and time whereof, he requireth us to shew. The other two respect the testimonie, both of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> &amp; of the <hi>sacred Scriptures:</hi> which, in the points wherein we varie, if this man may be believed, maketh wholly for them, and against us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First then would he faine know, what Bishop of Rome did first alter that Religion, which wee commend in them of the first</hi> 400 <hi>yeares? In what Popes dayes was the true Religion overthrowne in Rome?</hi> To which I answere, First, that wee doe not hold that Rome was built in a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> day; or that the great dung-hill of errors, which now wee see in it, was raised in an age: and therefore it is a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19547:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vaine demand, to require from us the name of anie one Bishop of Rome, by whom or under whom this Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonish <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> confusion was brought in. Secondly, that a great difference is to be put betwixt Heresies which openly oppose the foundations of our Faith; and that Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie which the Spirit hath evidently foretold should bee brought in by such as <hi>speake lyes in hypocrisie.</hi> (1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 2.) The impietie of the one is so notorious, that at the verie first appearance it is manifestly discerned: the other is a <hi>mysterie of iniquitie</hi> (as the Apostle termeth it, 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.7.) <hi>iniquitas, sed mystica, id est, pietatis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine palliata,</hi> (so the ordinarie Glosse expoundeth the place) <hi>an iniquitie indeed, but mysticall, that is, cloked vvith the name of pietie.</hi> And therefore they who kept continuall watch and ward against the one, might sleepe while the seeds of the other were a sowing; yea peradventure might at unawares themselves have some hand in bringing in of this Trojan horse, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended thus unto them under the name of Religion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> and semblance of devotion. Thirdly, that the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of errors is oftentimes so obscure, and their breede so base, that howsoever it might be easily observed by such as lived in the same age, yet no wise man will mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, if in tract of time the beginnings of manie of them should be forgotten, and no register of the time of their birth found extant. Wee <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 23.8.</note> reade that the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducees taught, there were no Angels: is any man able to declare unto us, under what high Priest they first broached this error? The <hi>Grecians, Circassians, Georgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Syrians, Egyptians, Habassines, Muscovites</hi> and <hi>Rus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi> dissent at this day from the Church of Rome in many particulars: will you take upon you to shew in what Bishops dayes these severall differences did first a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise?
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19547:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
When the point hath been well skanned, it will be found, that many errors have crept into their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, the time of the entrance whereof you are not able to designe: and some things also are maintained by you against them, which have not been delivered for Catholick doctrine in the primitive times, but brought in afterwards, your selves know not when.</p>
            <p>Such, for example, is that sacrilege of yours, whereby you withhold from the people the use of the Cuppe in the Lords Supper; as also your doctrine of Indulgences and Purgatorie: which they reject, and you defend. For touching the first, <note n="b" place="margin">

               <hi>Gregorius de Valentia,</hi> one of your principall Champions, confesseth that the use of receiving the Sacrament in one kinde, began first in some Churches, and grew to be a generall custome in the Latin Church not much before the Councell of Constance, in which at last (to wit, 200 yeres ago) this custome was made a law. But if you put the question to him, as you doe to us, What Bishop of Rome did first bring in this custome? he giveth you this answer, that it <hi>began to be used, not by the decree of any Bishop, but by the very use of the Churches, and the consent of the faithfull.</hi> If you further question with him, <hi>quando pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum vigere coepit ea consuetudo in aliquibus Ecclesijs? When first did that custome get footing in some Churches?</hi> he returneth you for answer, <hi>Minimé constat:</hi> it is more then he can tell.</p>

Opusc. tom.</hi> 1. <hi>tract</hi> 15. <hi>de Indulgent. cap</hi> 1.</note> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Caietan</hi> give us to understand of <hi>Indulgences</hi>; that no certaintie can be had, what their originall was, or by whom they were first brought in. <hi>Fisher</hi> also fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther addeth concerning <hi>Purgatorie:</hi> that in the ancient Fathers, there is either none at all, or very rare mention
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19547:14"/>
of it; that by the Grecians it is not beleeved even to this day; that the Latins also, <hi>not all at once,</hi> but <hi>by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little</hi> received it: and that, Purgatorie being so lately knowen, it is not to be mervailed, that in the first times of the Church there was no use of Indulgences; seeing these had their beginning, after that men for a while had been affrighted with the torments of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie. Out of which confession of the adverse part, you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> may observe: 1. What little reason these men have, to require us to set down the precise time wherin all their <hi>profane novelties</hi> were first brought in: seeing that this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is more then they themselves are able to doe. 2. That some of them may come in <hi>pedetentim</hi> (as <hi>Fisher</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth <hi>Purgatory</hi> did) by little and little, and by very slow steps, which are not so easie to be discerned, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> as fooles be borne in hand they are. 3. That it is a fond imagination, to suppose that all such changes must be made by some Bishop, or any one certaine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor: whereas it is confessed, that some may come in by the tacite consent of manie, and grow after into a generall custome, the beginning whereof is past mans memorie.</p>
            <p>And as some superstitious usages may draw their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall from the undiscreet devotion of the multitude: so some also may be derived from want of devotion in the people; and some alterations likewise must be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the verie change of time it selfe. Of the one we cannot give a fitter instance, then in your private Masse, wherein the Priest receiveth the Sacrament a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: which <note n="c" place="margin">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19547:14"/>
what Popes dayes your private Masse began. An expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment of the other wee may see in the use of the Latin Service, in the Churches of <hi>Italy, France,</hi> and <hi>Spaine.</hi> For if wee be questioned, When that use first beganne there? and further demanded, <note n="f" place="margin">
                  <hi>Allen. artic.</hi> 11. <hi>demand.</hi> 9.</note>Whether the language formerly used in their Liturgie, was changed upon a suddaine? our answer must be, That Latin Service was used in those countries from the beginning: but that the Latin tongue at that time was commonly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of all, which afterward by little and little degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into those vulgar languages which now are used. When you therefore shall be pleased to certifie us, in what Popes dayes the <hi>Latin</hi> tongue was changed into the <hi>Italian, French,</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> (which we pray you doe for our learning:) wee will then give you to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that from that time forward the language, not of the Service, but of the people, was altered. <hi>Nec enim lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gua vulgaris populo subtracta est, sed populus ab eà reces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit</hi> (saith <note n="g" place="margin">

any deny it, it shall be presently shewen) that the Doctors, Pastors, and Fathers of that Church doe allow of Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c.</hi> And againe: <hi>Now would I faine know, whether of both have the true Religion; they that hold all these a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovesaid points with the primitive Church, or they that do most vehemently contradict, and gainsay them? they that doe not disagree with that holy Church, in any point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; or they that agree with it but in very few, and disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in almost all?</hi> And the third time too, for fayling: <hi>Now would I willingly see, what reasonable answer may be made to this. For the Protestants graunt that the Church of Rome, for 400 or 500 yeares, held the true Religion of Christ: yet do they exclaime against the abovesaid articles, which the same Church did maintaine and uphold; as may be shewen by the expresse testimonies of the Fathers of the same Church, and shall be largely layd downe, if any learned Protestant will deny it.</hi>

               <hi>Wheresoever in these bookes I have made mention of the Church not having spot or wrinkle; it is not so to be taken, as if she were so now, but that she is prepared to bee so, when she shall appeare glorious. For now, by reason of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ignorances and infirmities of her members, the whole Church hath cause to say every day: Forgive us our tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes.</hi> Now as long as the Church is subject to these <hi>ignorances and infirmities,</hi> it cannot be otherwise, but there must be differences betwixt the members thereof: one part may understand that whereof an other is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant; and ignorance being the mother of error, one particular Church may wrongly conceive of some points, wherein others may be rightly informed. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will it follow thereupon, that these Churches must be of different Religions, because they fully agree not in all things: or that therefore the Reformed Churches in our dayes must disclaime all kindred with those in ancient times, because they have washed away some spots from themselves, which they discerned to have been in them.</p>
            <p>It is not every spot that taketh away the beautie of a Church, not every sicknesse that taketh away the life thereof: and therefore though wee should admit that the ancient Church of Rome was somewhat impaired both in beautie and in health too, (wherein we have no reason to be sorie, that we are unlike unto her) there is no necessitie that hereupon presently she must cease to be our sister. S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and the rest of the African Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops that joined with him, held that such as were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by heretickes, should be rebaptized: the African Bishops in the time of <hi>Aurelius</hi> were of another minde. Doth the diversitie of their judgements in this point,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:19547:23"/>
make them to have been of a diverse Religion? It was the use of the ancient Church to minister the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion unto Infants: which is yet also practised by the Christians in Egypt and Ethiopia. The Church of Rome, upon better consideration, hath thought fit to doe otherwise: and yet for all that will not yeeld, that either she her selfe hath forsaken the Religion of her ancestors, because she followeth them not in this; or that they were of the same religion with the Coph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and Habassines, because they agree together in this particular. So put case the Church of Rome now did use prayer for the dead in the same maner that the ancient Church did: (which we will shew to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise:) the reformed Churches that upon better advice have altered that usage, need not therefore graunt that eyther themselves hold a different Religion from that of the Fathers, because they doe not precisely follow them in this, nor yet that the Fathers were therefore Papists, because in this point they thus concurred. For as two may be discerned to be sisters by the likenesse of their faces, although the one have some spottes or ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes which the other hath not: so a third may bee brought in, which may shew like spots and blemishes, and yet have no such likenesse of visage as may bewray her to be the others sister.</p>

thereupon <hi>he would faine know, whether of both have the true Religion? they that doe not disagree with that holy Church in any point of Religion; or they that agree with it but in very few, and disagree in almost all?</hi> Indeed, if that which he assumeth for granted, could as easily bee proved, as it is boldly avouched: the question would quickly be resolved, <hi>whether of us both have the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?</hi> But he is to understand, that strong conceits are but weake proofes: and that the Iesuites have not been the first, from whom such bragges as these have beene heard. <hi>Dioscorus</hi> the hereticke was as peart, when hee uttered these speeches in the Councell of Chalcedon: <note n="s" place="margin">

               </head>
               <p>TO begin therefore with <hi>Traditions,</hi> which is your forlorne Hope that in the first place we are to set upon: this must I needes tell you before we begin, that you much mistake the matter, if you thinke that Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of all sorts promiscuously are struck at by our Religion. We willingly acknowledge, that the word of God which by some of the Apostles was set downe in writing, was both by themselves, and others of their fellow-labourers, delivered by word of mouth: and that the Church in succeeding ages was bound not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to preserve those sacred writings committed to her trust, but also to deliver unto her children <hi>vivâ voce</hi> the forme of wholsome words contayned therein. Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions therefore of this nature, come not within the compasse of our controversie: the question being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us <hi>de ipsâ doctrinâ traditâ,</hi> not <hi>de tradendi modo</hi>; touching the substance of the doctrine delivered, not of the maner of delivering it. Againe, it must be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred that here wee speake of doctrine delivered as <hi>the word of God,</hi> that is, of points of religion revealed unto the Prophets and Apostles, for the perpetuall informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods people: not of rites and ceremonies, and other ordinances which are left to the disposition of the Church, and consequently be not of <hi>divine</hi> but of <hi>posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> and <hi>humane</hi> right. Traditions therefore of this kinde likewise are not properly brought within the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit of this question.</p>
               <p>But that Traditions of men should be obtruded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us for articles of Religion, and admitted for parts of Gods worship; or that any Traditions should be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19547:30"/>
for parcels of Gods word, beside the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and such doctrines as are either expressely therein contayned, or by sound inference may be deduced from thence: I thinke wee have reason to gainsay. As long as for the first wee have this direct sentence from God himselfe; <hi>Matth. 15. In vaine doe they worship me, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for doctrines, the Commandements of men.</hi> And for the second, the expresse warrant of the Apostle, <hi>2. Tim. 3.</hi> testifying of the holy Scriptures, not onely that they <hi>are able to make us wise unto salvation</hi> (which they should not be able to doe, if they did not containe all things necessary to salvation) but also that by them <hi>the man of God</hi> (that is, <note n="x" place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.11.</note> the minister of Gods word, unto whom it appertaineth <note n="y" place="margin">

               <p>Now whether herein we disagree from the doctrine generally received by the <hi>Fathers:</hi> we referre our selves to their owne sayings.

is this: That in the receiving of the blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we are to distinguish betweene the outward and the inward action of the Communicant.

They of the adverse part have made such a confusion of these things, that for the <hi>first,</hi> they do utterly denie, that after the words of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration there remaineth anie Bread or Wine at all to be received: and for the <hi>second,</hi> do affirme, that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and bloud of Christ is in such a maner present, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the outward shewes of bread and wine, that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever receiveth the one (be he good or bad, beleever or unbeleever) doth therewith really receive the other.

               <p>Touching our Saviours speech, of the <hi>eating of his flesh,</hi> and the <hi>drinking of his bloud,</hi> in the sixth of <hi>Iohn</hi>;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19547:35"/>
these five things specially may be observed. <hi>First,</hi> that the question betwixt our Adversaries &amp; us, being not, Whether Christs bodie be turned into bread, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bread be turned into Christs bodie; the words in S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> if they be pressed literally, serve more strongly to prove the former, then the latter. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that this Sermon was uttered by our Saviour, above a yeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the celebration of his last Supper, wherein the Sacrament of his bodie and bloud was instituted: at which time none of his hearers could possibly have understood him to have spoken of the externall eating of him in the Sacrament. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that by the eating of the flesh of Christ, and the drinking of his bloud, there, is not here meant an externall eating or drinking with the mouth and throate of the bodie, (as the <note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh</hi> 6.52.</note> Iewes then, and the Romanists farre more grossely then they, have since imagined:) but an internall and a spirituall, effected by a lively faith and the quickning spirit of Christ in the soule of the beleever. For <note n="e" place="margin">

                  <hi>there is a spirituall mouth of the inner man,</hi> (as S. <hi>Basil</hi> noteth) <hi>wherewith hee is nourished that is made partaker of the Word of life, which is the bread that commeth downe from heaven. Fourthly,</hi> that this spirituall feeding upon the bodie and blood of Christ, is not to be found in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament onely, but also out of the Sacrament. <hi>Fiftly,</hi> that the eating of the flesh, and the drinking of the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ood here mentioned, is of such excellent vertue, that the receiver is thereby made to remaine in Christ, and Christ in him, and by that meanes certainly freed from d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ath, and assured of everlasting life. Which seeing it cannot be verified of the eating of the Sacrament (whereof both the godly &amp; the wicked are partakers:) it proveth, not onely that our Saviour did not here
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19547:35"/>
speake of the Sacramentall eating; but further also, that the thing which is delivered in the externall part of the Sacrament, cannot be conceived to be really, but sacramentally onely, the flesh and blood of Christ.</p>
               <p>The <hi>first</hi> of these may be plainly seene in the Text: where our Saviour doth not onely say, <hi>I am the bread of life,</hi> vers. 48. and, <hi>I am the living bread that came downe from heaven,</hi> vers. 51. but addeth also in the 55. verse. <hi>For my flesh is meate indeed, and my bloud is drinke indeed.</hi> Which words being the most forcible of all the rest, &amp; those wherewith the simpler sort are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded, might carry some shew of proofe, that Christs flesh &amp; blood should be turned into bread &amp; wine; but have no maner of colour to prove, that bread and wine are turned into the flesh and blood of Christ. The truth of the <hi>second,</hi> appeareth by the four<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h verse: in which we finde, that this fell out not long before the <hi>Passeover</hi>; and consequently, a yeare at least before that last Passeover, wherein our Saviour instituted the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of his Supper. Wee willingly indeed do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that that which is inwardly presented in the Lords Supper, and spiritually received by the soule of the faithfull, is that verie thing which is treated of in the sixth of Iohn: but wee denie that it was our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours intention in this place, to speake of that which is externally delivered in the Sacrament, and orally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Communicant. And for our warrant herein, wee need looke no further then to that earnest asseveration of our Saviour in the 53. verse: <hi>Verily, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I say unto you; Except yee eate the flesh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his blood, ye have no life in you.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is not onely an obligation laid upon them for doing of this, (which in no likelyhood could be inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:19547:36"/>
of the externall eating of the Sacrament, that was not as yet in being:) but also an absolute necessitie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, <hi>non praecepti solùm ratione, sed etia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> medij.</hi> Now to hold, that all they are excluded from life, which have not had the meanes to receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: is as untrue, as it is uncharitable. And therefore manie of the Papists themselves, as <hi>Biel, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanus, Cajelan, Tapper, Hessels, Iansenius,</hi> and others, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that our Saviour in the sixth of <hi>Iohn</hi> did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly treat of the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> of the points proposed, may be collected out of the first part of Christs speech, in the 35. and 36. verses. <hi>I am the bread of life: hee that commeth to mee, shall never hunger; and he that beleeveth on me, shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thirst. But I said unto you, that yee also have seene me, and beleeve not.</hi> But especially, out of the last, from the 61. verse forward. <hi>When Iesus knew in himselfe that his Disciples murmured at it, hee said unto them; Doeth this offend you? What then if you should see the Sonne of man ascend up where hee was before? It is the spirit that quickneth, the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speake unto you are spirit and life. But there are some of you that beleeve not.</hi> Which words <hi>Athanasius</hi> (or whosoever was the author of the Tractate upon that place; <hi>Quicunque dixerit verbum in filium homi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that those very words and speeches of his, are his flesh and blood; whereof who is partaker, being alwayes therewith nourished as it were with heavenly bread, shall likewise be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of heavenly life. Therefore let not that offend you, saith he, which I have spoken of the eating of my flesh and of the drinking of my blood; neither let the superficiall hearing of those things which were said by me of flesh and blood, trouble you.

               <p>There remaineth the <hi>fift</hi> and last point: which is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes repeated by our Saviour in this Sermon. as in the 50. verse: <hi>This is the bread which commeth downe from heaven, that a man may eate thereof, and not dye,</hi> and in the 51: <hi>If any man eate of this bread, hee shall live for ever.</hi> and in the 54: <hi>Who so eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternall life.</hi> and in the 56: <hi>He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in mee, and I in him.</hi> and in the 58: <hi>This is that bread which came downe from heaven: not as your fathers did eate Manna, and are
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19547:38"/>
dead: hee that eateth of this bread, shall live for ever.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Origen</hi> rightly observeth the difference that is betwixt the eating of the <hi>typicall</hi> or <hi>symbolicall</hi> (for so he calleth the Sacrament) and the <hi>true</hi> bodie of Christ. Of the former, thus he writeth: <note n="s" place="margin">Quod sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatur per ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum Dei &amp; per obsecratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, non suáp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te naturâ san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctificat uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.

For hee said this, as if he should have said: He that remayneth not in me, and in whom I do not remaine; let not him say or thinke, that he eateth my flesh or drinketh my bloud.</hi> And in another place, expounding those words of Christ here alledged; hee thereupon inferreth thus: <note n="y" place="margin">Hoc est ergo manducare il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam escam, &amp; illum bibere potum; in Christo mane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, &amp; illum ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentem in se habere.

                  <hi>This is therefore to eate that meate, and drinke that drinke; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in Christ, and to have Christ remayning in him. And by this, he that remaineth not in Christ, and in whom Christ abideth not, without doubt doth neither spiritually eate his flesh, nor drinke his bloud: although he do carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and visibly presse with his teeth the Sacrament of the bodie and bloud of Christ; and so rather eateth and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Sacrament of so great a thing for judgement to himselfe, because that being uncleane hee did presume to come unto the Sacraments of Christ.</hi>

For he that is at discord with Christ, doth neither eate his flesh nor drinke his bloud: although, to the judgement of his presumption, he indifferently doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive everie day the sacrament of so great a thing.</hi> Which distinction betweene the <hi>Sacrament</hi> and the <hi>thing</hi> whereof it is a sacrament, (and consequently betweene the <hi>sacramentall</hi> and the <hi>reall</hi> eating of the bodie of Christ,) is thus briefely and most excellently expressed by S. <hi>Augustine</hi> himselfe, in his exposition upon the sixt of <hi>Iohn.</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Hujus rei sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cramentum de mensâ Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicâ sumitur; quibusdam ad vitam, quibus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam ad exitiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                  <hi>The sacrament of this thing, is taken from the Lords Table; by some unto life, by some unto destruction: but the thing it selfe whereof it is a sacrament, is received by every man unto life, and by none unto destruction, that is made partaker therof.</hi> Our conclusion therfore is this:
<q>
                     <p>The bodie and bloud of Christ, is received by all unto life, and by none unto condemnation.</p>
                     <p>But that substance which is outwardly delivered in the Sacrament, is not received by all unto life, but by manie unto condemnation.</p>
                     <p>Therefore that substance which is outwardly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in the Sacrament, is not really the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and bloud of Christ.</p>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:19547:39"/>
The first proposition is plainly proved by the Texts which have been alledged out of the sixth of <hi>Iohn.</hi> The second is manifest, both by common experience, and by the testimonie of the Apostle, <hi>1. Cor. 11. vers. 17, 27, 29.</hi> We may therefore well conclude, that the sixth of <hi>Iohn</hi> is so farre from giving anie furtherance to the doctrine of the Romanists in this point, that it utterly overthroweth their fond opinion, who imagine the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and bloud of Christ to be in such a sort present un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the visible formes of bread and wine, that whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver receiveth the one, must of force also really be made partaker of the other.</p>
               <p>The like are we now to shew in the words of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</hi> For the better clearing whereof, the Reader may be pleased to consider, <hi>first,</hi> that the words are not; <hi>This shall be my body:</hi> nor, <hi>This is made,</hi> or, <hi>shall be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into my body:</hi> but, <hi>This</hi> Is <hi>my body. Secondly,</hi> that the word THIS, can have relation to no other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but that which was then present, when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour spake that word; which (as wee shall make it plainly appeare) was <hi>Bread. Thirdly,</hi> that it being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the word <hi>This,</hi> doth demonstrate the Bread; it must of necessitie follow, that Christ affirming that to be his BODY, cannot be conceived to have meant it so to be properly, but relatively and sacramentally.</p>
               <p>The first of these, is by both sides yeelded unto: so likewise is the third.

A matter which easily might be determined, in anie indifferent mans judgement, by the words immedia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For what did hee demonstrate here, and said was his Body, but that which he gave unto his Disciples? What did hee give unto them, but what he brake? What brake hee, but what he tooke? and doth not the Text expressely say, that <hi>he tooke bread?</hi> Was it not therefore of the Bread, he said; <hi>This is my Body?</hi> And could Bread pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly bee otherwise understood to have beene his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, but as a Sacrament, and (as hee himselfe with the same breath declared his owne meaning) a <hi>memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall</hi> thereof?</p>
               <p>If these words be not of themselves cleare enough, but have need of further exposition: can we looke for a better, then that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> giveth of them, 1. Cor. 10.16. <hi>The bread which we breake, is it not the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:19547:40"/>
of the bodie of Christ?</hi> Did not S. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore so understand Christ, as if he had said; <hi>This bread is my body?</hi> And if Christ had said so; doth not <hi>Kellison</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, and right reason evince, that hee must have beene understood figuratively? considering that it is simply impossible, that Bread should really be the Bodie of Christ. If it be said, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> by <hi>Bread,</hi> doth not here understand that which is properly Bread, but that which lately was bread (but now is become the bodie of Christ:) we must remember, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not onely say <hi>The bread,</hi> but <hi>The bread which vvee breake.</hi> which <hi>breaking,</hi> being an accident properly belonging to the bread it selfe, and not to the bodie of Christ (which being in glorie, cannot be subject to anie more breaking) doth evidently shew, that the Apostle by <hi>Bread</hi> understandeth Bread indeed. Neither can the Romanists well denie this, unlesse they wil denie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and confesse that they did but dreame all this while they have imagined that the change of the bread into the bodie of Christ, is made by vertue of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall words alone, which have not their effect untill they have all beene fully uttered. For the Pronoune THIS, which is the first of these words, doth point to somthing w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was then present. But no substance was then present but bread: seeing by their owne grounds, the bodie of Christ commeth not in, untill the last word of that sentence, yea and the last syllable of that word, be completely pronounced. What other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance therefore can they make <hi>this</hi> to signifie, but <hi>this bread</hi> only?</p>
               <p>In the institution of the other part of the Sacrament, the words are yet more plaine, Matth. 26. vers. 27.28. <hi>He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:19547:41"/>
Drinke yee all of it. For this is my blood of the new Testament:</hi> or, (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> and S. <hi>Luke</hi> relate it) <hi>This cup is the new Testament in my blood.</hi> That which hee bidd them all drinke of, is that which hee said was his blood. But our Saviour could meane nothing but the <hi>Wine,</hi> when he said, <hi>Drinke ye all of it:</hi> because this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was uttered by him before the words of consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at which time our Adversaries themselves doe confesse, that there was nothing in the cup but wine, or wine and water at the most. It was <hi>wine</hi> therefore which he said was his <hi>blood:</hi> even <hi>the fruite of the Vine,</hi> as he himselfe termeth it. For as in the deliverie of the other cup before the institution of the Sacrament, S. <hi>Luke</hi> (who alone maketh mention of that part of the historie) telleth us, that hee said unto his Disciples; <note n="h" place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.18.</note> 
                  <hi>I will not drinke of the fruit of the Vine, untill the kingdome of God shall come:</hi> so doth S <hi>Matthew</hi> and S. <hi>Marke</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise testifie, that at the deliverie of the Sacramentall cup, when he had said, <hi>This is my blood of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is shed for many for the remission of sinnes</hi>; hee also added: <note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.29. <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.25.</note> 
                  <hi>But I say unto you, I will not drinke henceforth of this fruit of the Vine, untill that day that I drinke it new with you in my Fathers kingdome.</hi> Now seeing it is contrary both to sense and saith, that <hi>Wine</hi> or <hi>the fruite of the Vine,</hi> should really be the <hi>blood</hi> of Christ; there being that formall difference in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the things, that there is an utter impossibilitie that in true proprietie of speech the one should be the other: nothing in this world is more plain, than when our Saviour said it was his <hi>blood,</hi> he could not meane it to be so substantially, but sacramentally.</p>

(saith he) <hi>useth to be called by the name of that thing which it signifieth. as it is written: The seven eares of corne, are seven yeares; (for hee said not; they signifie se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven yeares:) and the seven Kine are seven yeares: and many such like. Hence was that saying: The Rocke was Christ. For he said not, The Rock did signifie Christ; but as if it had beene that very thing, which doubtlesse by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance it was not, but by signification. So also the blood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause for a certaine vitall corpulencie which it hath, it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the soule; after the maner of Sacraments it is called the soule.</hi> Our argument therefore out of the words of the institution, standeth thus:
<q>
                     <p>If it be true, that Christ called Bread his bodie, and Wine his blood: then must it be true also, that the things which bee honoured with those names, cannot be really his bodie &amp; blood, but figuratively and sacramentally.</p>
                     <p>But the former is true. Therefore also the latter.</p>
                  </q>
The first proposition hath bene proved by the undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted principles of right reason, and the cleare confession of the adverse part: the second, by the circumstances of the Text of the Evangelists, by the exposition of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and by the received grounds of the Romanists themselves.

               <p>If I should now lay downe here all the sentences of the Fathers, which teach that that which Christ called his Body, is Bread in substance, and the Body of the

But the men with whom wee have to deale, are so farre fallen out with the truth; that neither sense nor reason, neither authoritie of Scriptures or of Fathers, can perswade them to be friends againe with it: unlesse we shew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, in what Popes dayes the contrarie falshood was first devised.

we must put them in minde, that about the time wherein <hi>Soter</hi> was Bishop of Rome, there lived a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sening companion, called <hi>Marcus</hi>; whose qualities are thus set out by an ancient Christian, <note n="a" place="margin">

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:19547:59"/>
the more ancient Fathers this strict discipline was not so restrayned to the censure of publicke crimes; but that private transgressions also were sometimes drawn within the compasse of it. For whereas at first, publike confession was enjoyned onely for publike offences: men afterwards, discerning what great benefit redoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the penitents thereby, (aswell for the subduing of the stubburnesse of their hard hearts, and the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of their deeper humiliation; as for their ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing up againe by those sensible comforts which they received by the publike prayers of the Congregation, and the use of the keyes) some men, I say, discerning this, and finding their owne consciences burdened with the like sinnes, which being carried in secrecie, were not subject to the censures of the Church; to the end they might obtaine the like consolation and quiet of minde, did voluntarily submit themselves to the Churches discipline herein, and undergoe the burden of publick Confession and Penance. This appeareth by <hi>Origen</hi> in his second Homily upon the 37 Psalme, <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his booke <hi>de Poenitentiâ,</hi> chap. 9. S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his Treatise <hi>de Lapsis,</hi> sect. 23. (or 11. according to <hi>Pamelius</hi> his distinction) S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> in his first booke <hi>de Poenitentiâ,</hi> chap. 16. and others. And to the end that this publication of secret faults might be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the best maner: some prudent Minister was first of all made acquainted therewith; by whose dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction the delinquent might understand what sinnes were fit to be brought to the publick notice of the Church, and in what maner the penance was to bee performed for them. Therefore did <hi>Origen</hi> advise (as wee heard) that one should use great care in making choyce of a good and skilfull physician, to whom hee

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:19547:60"/>
their faults. Whereby it is manifest, that the libertie brought in by <hi>Nectarius,</hi> of not resorting to any Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiarie, respected the disclosing of secret sinnes only; such as that foule one was, from whence the publick scandall arose, which gave occasion to the repeale of the former Constitution. For to suffer open and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious crimes, committed in the Church, to passe without controule, was not a meane to prevent but to augment scandalls; nay the readie way, to make the house of God become a denne of theeves.</p>
               <p>Two observations more I will adde upon this part of the historie. The one: that the abrogation of this Canon sheweth, that the forme of Confession used by the ancient, was <hi>Canonical,</hi> that is, appertayning to that externall discipline of the Church which upon just oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion might be altered; and not <hi>Sacramentall,</hi> and of perpetuall right, which is that our Iesuites stand for. The other: that the course taken herein by <hi>Nectarius,</hi> was not onely approved by S. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> who succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him at Constantinople; but <note n="c" place="margin">

And therefore when within some XXI. yeares after the time wherein they finished their histories, and about LXX. after that the publication of secret offences began to be abolished by <hi>Nectarius,</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in Italy did so doe their penance, that they caused a writing to be publickly read, containing a profession of their severall sinnes: <hi>Leo,</hi> who at that time was Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop

For if the soules be fully purged here from all spot of sinne: what need have they to be sent unto anie other Purgatorie after this life? Yes, say they, although the fault be quite remitted, and the soule clearely freed from the pollution thereof: yet may there remaine a temporall punishment due for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie mortall sinnes that have beene committed; which (if reliefe doe not otherwise come, by the helpe of such as are alive) must be soundly layd on in <hi>Purgatory.</hi> But why in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> say we; seeing here there is no more purging worke left? for the fault and the blot being

taken away already; what remaineth yet to be purged? The punishment onely they say is left behinde: and punishment, I hope, they will not hold to be the thing that is purged away by punishment. Againe we desire them to tell us, what Father or ancient Doctor did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver teach this strange divinity? that a man being cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purged from the blott of his sinne, and fully acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted here from the fault thereof; should yet in the other world be punished for it with such grievous torments as the tongue of man is not able to expresse. And yet, as new and as absurd a doctrine as it is, the Pope and his adherents have builded thereupon both their guile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Purgatory</hi> (with which it suteth as evill-favoured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as may be) and their gainefull <hi>Indulgences</hi>; which, by their own doctrine, <note n="z" place="margin">

               <p>PRayer for the dead, as it is used in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> doth necessarily suppose Purgatorie: and therefore whatsoever hath beene alledged out of the Scriptures and Fathers against the one, doth stand in full force against the other. so that here wee need not <hi>actum agere,</hi> and make a new worke of overthrowing that, which hath beene sufficiently beaten down alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.

                  <hi>Purgatory and prayer for the

dead be so closely lincked together, that the one doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily follow the other:</hi> but in so doing, they reckon without their hoste, and greatly mistake the matter. For howsoever they may deale with their owne devises as they please, and lincke their Prayers with their Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie as closely as they list: yet shall they never be able to shew, that the commemoration and prayers for the dead, used by the ancient Church, had anie relation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Purgatorie; and therefore whatsoever they were, Popish prayers we are sure they were not. I easily foresee, that the full opening of the judgement of the Fathers in this point, will hardly stand with that brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which I intended to use in treating of these latter questions: the particulars be so manie, that necessarily doe incurre into the handling of this argument. But I suppose the Reader will be content rather to dispense with that promise, whereby I did abbridge my selfe of the libertie which otherwise I might freely have taken: than be sent away unsatisfied in a matter, wherein the Adversarie beareth himselfe confident beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, that the whole streame of antiquity runneth clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon his side.</p>
               <p>That the truth then of things may the better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare: we are here prudently to distinguish the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall institution of the Church, from the private opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of particular Doctors which waded further herein then the generall intendment of the Church did give them warrant; and diligently to consider, that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morialls, oblations and prayers made for the dead at the beginning, had reference to such as rested from their labours, and not unto anie soules which were thought to be tormented in that <hi>Vtopian</hi> Purgatorie, whereof there was no newes stirring in those dayes.

                  <hi>After the death of most glorious Hierome, a certaine heresie or sect arose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Grecians, and came to the Latines also, which went about with their wicked reasons to prove: that the soules of the blessed untill the day of the generall Iudgment, wherein they were to be joyned againe unto their bodies, are deprived of the sight and knowledge of God, in which the whole blessednesse of the Saincts doth consist; and that the soules of the damned in like maner untill that day are tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with no paines. Whose reason was this: that as the soule did merit or sinne with the body; so with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die was it to receive rewards or paines. Those wicked secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries also did maintaine, that there was no place of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory wherein the soules, vvhich had not done full penance for their sinnes in this world, might be purged. Which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilent sect getting head, so great sorrow fell upon us, that we were even weary of our life.</hi> Then he telleth a wise tale, how S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> being at that time with God, for the confutation of this new-sprong heresie, raysed up <hi>three</hi> men from the dead (after that hee had first <note n="f" place="margin">Nam (ut mihi postmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dùm interroganti dixerunt) beatus Hieronymus eos conduxerat secum in Paradisum, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorium, &amp; Infernum: ut quae ibi agebantur, patefacerent universis. <hi>Ibid.</hi>

               <p>We are to consider then, that the prayers and obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for reiecting whereof <hi>Aërius</hi> was reproved, were not such as are used in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at this day, but such as were used by the ancient Church at that time: and therefore as we in condemning of the one, have nothing to doe with <hi>Aërius</hi> or his cause; so the Romanists, who dislike the other as much as ever <hi>Aërius</hi> did, must be content to let us alone, and take the charge of <hi>Aërianisme</hi> home unto themselves. Popish prayers and oblations for the dead, we know, do whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depend upon the beleefe of Purgatorie: if those of the ancient Church did so too; how commeth it to passe that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> doth not directly answer <hi>Aërius,</hi> as a Papist would doe now, that they brought singular profite to the dead, by delivering their tormented soules out of the flames of Purgatorie? but forgetting as much as once to make mention of Purgatorie (the sole foundation of these suffrages for the dead, in our Adversaries iudgement) doth trouble himselfe and his cause, with bringing in such farr fett reasons as these: that they who performed this dutie, did intend to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie thereby that their brethren departed were not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished, but remained still alive with the Lord; and to put a difference betwixt the high perfection of our Saviour <hi>Christ,</hi> and the generall frailtie of the best of all his servants.

                  <hi>if Purgatory be not admitted after death, prayer for the dead must be unprofitable.</hi> But though <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> and his abettors determine so, we must not therefore thinke that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> was of the same minde; who lived in a time wherein pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were usually made for them that never were drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to have beene in Purgatorie, and yeeldeth those reasons of that usage, which overthrow the former consequence of <hi>Thomas</hi> everie whit as much, as the supposition of <hi>Aërius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For <hi>Aërius</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> both agree in this: that prayer for the dead would be altogether unprofitable, if the dead themselves received no speciall benefite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. This doth <hi>Epiphanius</hi> (defending the ancient use of these prayers in the Church) shew to be untrue; by producing other profites that redounded from thence unto the living: partly by the publick signification of their faith, hope, &amp; charitie toward the deceased; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the honour that they did unto the Lord <hi>Iesus,</hi> in exempting him from the common condition of the rest of mankinde. And to make it appeare, that these things were mainly intended by the Church in her Memorialls for the dead, and not the cutting off of the sinnes which they carried with them out of this life, or the releasing of them out of anie torment: he alledgeth (as wee have heard) that not onely the meaner sort of Christians, but also the best of them without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, even the Prophets and Apostles &amp; Martyrs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, were comprehended therein. from whence, by our Adversaries good leave, we wil make bold to frame this syllogisme.
<q>
                     <p>They who reject that kind of praying and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for the dead, which was practised by the

                     </p>
                     <p>But the Romanists doe reject that kinde of praying and offering for the dead, which was practised by the Church in the dayes of <hi>Aërius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore the Romanists are in this point flatt <hi>Aë<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </q>
The assumption or second part of this argument (for the first we thinke no body will denie) is thus proved.
<q>
                     <p>They who are of the judgement, that prayers and oblations should not be made for such as are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved to be in blisse; doe reiect that kinde of praying and offering for the dead, which was practised by the ancient Church.</p>
                     <p>But the Romanists are of this iudgement.</p>
                     <p>Therefore they reiect that kinde of praying and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for the dead, which was practised by the ancient Church.</p>
                  </q>
The truth of the first of these propositions doth appear by the testimonie of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> compared with those manie other evidences whereby we have formerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that it was the custome of the ancient Church to make prayers and oblations for them, of whose resting in peace and blisse there was no doubt at all conceived.

               <p>Other Doctors were of another iudgement: that the dead received speciall profite by the prayers and oblations of the living; eyther for the remission of their sinnes, or the easing of their punishment. but whether this were restrained to smaller offences only, or such as lived and died in great sinnes might be made partakers of the same benefite, and whether these mens torments might be lessened only thereby, or in tract of time quite extinguished; they did not agree upon.

to be admitted unto the place of rest, but must first be reckoned withall; both for the committall of those smaller faults, unto which through humane frailtie he was daily subject, and for the not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of full penance and satisfaction for the greater sinnes into which in this life he had fallen: and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie being the place wherein he must be cleansed from the one, and make up the iust payment for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; these prayers were directed unto God for the deliverie of the poore soule, which was not now in case to helpe it selfe, out of that place of torment.</p>

                  <hi>They who thinke that</hi> HADES <hi>is properly the seate of the damned, be no lesse deceaved, then they who, when they read</hi> INFE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROS <hi>in Latin writers, doe interpret it of the same place.</hi> The lesse cause have wee to wonder, that <hi>Hell</hi> in the Scripture should bee made the place of all the dead in common, and not of the wicked onely. as in Psalm. 89.47, 48. <hi>Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vaine? What man is hee that liveth, and shall not see death? shall hee deliver his soule from the hand of</hi> HELL? and Esai. 38.18, 19. HELL <hi>cannot prayse thee, death cannot celebrate thee: they that goe downe into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</hi> The LIVING, <hi>the</hi> LIVING, <hi>hee shall prayse thee, as I doe this day.</hi> Where the opposition betwixt <hi>Hell</hi> and the state of <hi>life</hi> in this world is to be observed. Now as the common condition of the dead is considerable three maner of wayes, eyther in respect of the body sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the soule, or of the soule separated from the bodie, or of the whole man indefinitely considered in this state of separation: so do we finde the word <hi>Hádes</hi> (which by the Latins is rendred <hi>Infernus</hi> or <hi>Inferi,</hi> and by the English, <hi>Hell</hi>) to be applied by the ancient Greek interpreters of the old Testament to the common state and place of the bodie severed from the soule, by the heathen Greekes to the common state and place of the soule severed from the bodie, and by both of them to the common state of the dead, and the place propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably correspondent to that state of dissolution. And so the Doctors of the Church, speaking in the same language which they learned both from the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:19547:156"/>
and the forraine writers, are accordingly found to take the word in these three severall significations.</p>
               <p>Touching the first we are to note, that both the <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint</hi> in the Old Testament, and the <hi>Apostles</hi> in the <note n="i" place="margin">

                  </gap> HADES (and answerably thereunto the Latin Interpreters the word <hi>Infernus</hi> or <hi>Inferi,</hi> and the English the word <hi>Hell)</hi> for that which in the Hebrew text is named <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> SHEÓL: on the other side, where in the New Testament the word HADES is used, there the ancient Syriack transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor doth put <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Shejul</hi> in steed thereof. Now the Hebrew <hi>Sheol</hi> (and so the <hi>Chaldy, Syriack</hi> and <hi>Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> words which draw their originall from thence) doth properly denote the interior parts of the earth, that lye hidden from our sight; namely whatsoever tendeth downeward from the surface of the earth unto the center thereof. In which respect we see that the Scripture describeth <hi>Sheol</hi> to be a deepe place; and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth the depth thereof unto the heighth of Heaven. (Iob. 11.8. Psalm. 139.8. Amos 9.2.) Againe, because the bodies that live upon the surface of the earth, are corrupted within the bowells thereof; <note n="k" place="margin">

Ezech. 32.27.) the surface of the earth being the place appointed for the habitation of the living; the other parts ordayned to be the chambers of death. Thus they <hi>that are in the graves</hi> (Ioh. 5.28.) are said to <hi>sleepe in the dust of the earth</hi> (Dan. 12.2.) The Psalmist, in

For if wee do not thus understand the dead to bee raysed by the power of God out of their graves: they which are not committed to buriall, nor layd in graves, but have ended their life either in shipwrackes or in some desart places, so as they could not be committed to buriall, should not seeme to bee recokoned among them who are said should bee raysed up out of their graves. which would bee a very great absurditie.</hi> Thus <hi>Origen.</hi>

                  <hi>Epiphanius</hi> goeth a little furthet, and findeth out a mysterie in the water and bloud that fell from the Crosse upon the relicks of our first father lying buried under it: applying thereunto both that in the Gospell, of the <hi>arising of many of the Saints,</hi> Matth. 27.52. and that other place in S. <hi>Paule, Arise thou that sleepest, &amp;c.</hi> Ephes. 5.14. which strange speculation, with what great applause it was received by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude at the first delivery of it, and for how little reason: he that list may reade in the fourth book of S. <hi>Hieroms</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries, upon the 27. of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> &amp; in his third upon the fifth to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> for upon this first point, of <hi>Christs</hi> descent into the Hell of the grave, and the bringing of <hi>Adam</hi> and his children with him from thence, we have dwelt too long already.</p>
               <p>In the second place therefore we are now to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that as <hi>Hádes</hi> and <hi>Inferi,</hi> (which we call <hi>Hell</hi>) are applied by rhe Interpreters of the holy Scripture, to denote the place of bodies separated from their soules: so with forraine authors (in whose language, as being that wherewith the common people was acquainted,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:19547:175"/>
the Church also did use to speake) the same tearmes do signifie ordinarily the common lodge of soules separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from their bodies, whether the particular place as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed unto each of them be conceived to be an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of blisse or of miserie. For as when the Grave is said to be the common receptacle of dead bodies, it is not meant thereby that all dead carkasses are heaped together promiscuously in one certaine pit: so when the Heathen write that all the soules of the dead goe to <hi>Hades,</hi> their meaning is not, that they are all shut up together in one and the selfe same roome: but in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall onely they understand thereby the translation of them into the other world, the extreame parts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the <hi>Poëts</hi> place as farre asunder as wee doe Heaven and Hell.

But if any such sweet tradition as this were at first delivered unto the Church by <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles:</hi> we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand further, how it should come to passe, that for the space of 360. yeares together after the birth of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, we can finde mention no where of any such thing? For howsoever our Challenger giveth it out, <hi>that prayer to Saints was of great account,</hi> amongst the Fathers of the primitive Church, for the first 400. years after <hi>Christ:</hi> yet for <hi>nine</hi> parts of that time, I dare be bold to say, that he is not able to produce as much as one true testimonie out of any Father, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it may appeare, that any account at all was made of it; and for the <hi>tithe</hi> too, he shall finde perhaps before we have done, that he is not like to carry it away so cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as he weeneth.</p>
               <p>Whether those blessed spirits pray for us, is not the question here: but whether we are to pray unto them. That God onely is to be prayed unto, is the doctrine that was once delivered unto the Saints, for which we so earnestly contend: the Saints praying for us doth no way crosse this (for to whom should the <hi>Saints</hi> pray,

                  <hi>King of Saints?</hi>) their being prayed unto, is the onely stumbling block that lyeth in this way. And therefore in those first times, the former of these was admitted by some, as a matter of probabilitie: but the latter no way yeelded unto, as being derogatorie to the priviledge of the Deitie. <hi>Origen</hi> may be a witnesse of both: who touching the former writeth in this sort. <note n="m" place="margin">Ego sic ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitror, quòd omnes illi qui dormierunt ante nos pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres, pugnent nobiscum &amp; adjuvent nos orationibus suis Ita nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que etia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam de seniori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus magistris audivi dicente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Origen. in Iosue. homil.</hi> 16.</note>

                  <hi>it must not onely be confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that the faithfull in the Church doe adore before the Images (as some peradventure would cautelously speake) but also adore the Image it selfe, without what scruple you will: yea they doe reverence it with the same worship, wherewith they doe the thing that is represented thereby. Wherefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>if that ought to be adored with La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trîa</hi> (or, <hi>divine worship) this also is to bee adored with Latrîa; if with Dulîa or Hyperdulîa, this likewise is to be adored with the same kinde of worship.</hi> And so we see that <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> doth directly conclude; that <note n="h" place="margin">Sic sequitur, quòd eadem reverentia exhibeatur imagini Christi &amp; ipsi Christo Cùm ergo Christus adoretur adoratione latriae; consequens est, quòd ejus imago sit adoratione latriae adoranda. <hi>Thom Summ. part.</hi> 3. <hi>quaest.</hi> 25. <hi>artic.</hi> 3.</note>

of late to our hearing, that your brotherhood, seeing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine worshippers of Images, did breake the said Church-images and threw them away. And surely we commended you that you had that zeale, that nothing made with hands should be worshipped: but yet we judge that you should not have broken those images. For painting is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore used in Churches, that they which are unlearned, may yet by sight read those things upon the walles, which they cannot reade in bookes. Therefore your brotherhood ought, both to preserve the images, and to restraine the people from worshipping of them: that both the ignorant might have had, whence to gather the knowledge of the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie; and the people might not sinne in worshipping the picture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There would be no end, if we should lay downe at large the fierce contentions that afterwards arose in the Church touching this matter of Images: the Greeke Emperours, <hi>Leo Isaurus, Constantinus Caballi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Nicephorus, Stauratius, Leo Armenus, Michael Balbus, Theophilus,</hi> and others, opposing them in the East; and on the other side, <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>second</hi> &amp; <hi>third, Paul</hi> the <hi>first, Stephen</hi> the <hi>fourth, Adrian</hi> the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>second, Leo</hi> the <hi>third, Nicholas</hi> the <hi>first,</hi> &amp; other Popes of Rome as stiffely upholding them in the West. In a Councell of CCCXXXVIII. Bishops helde at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> in the yeare of our Lord 754. they were so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely condemned: in another Councell of CCCL. Bishops helde at <hi>Nice</hi> in the yeare 787. they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced againe, and the veneration of them as much commended. This base decree of the second <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell, touching the adoration of Images, although it were not by the hundreth part so grosse, as that which was afterwards invented by the Popish School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:19547:243"/>
yet was it reiected as repugnant to the doctrine of the Church of God; by the Princes and Bishops of <hi>England</hi> first, about the yeare 792. and by <hi>Charles</hi> the great afterward, and the Bishops of <hi>Italy, France</hi> &amp; <hi>Germany,</hi> which by his appointment were gathered together in the Councell of <hi>Frankford,</hi> the yeare of our Lord. 794.</p>
               <p>The foure bookes, which by his authoritie were published against that <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod, and the adoration of Images defended therein, are yet to be seene: as the Resolution also of the Doctors of <hi>France</hi> assembled at <hi>Paris</hi> by the command of his sonne <hi>Ludovicus Pius,</hi> in the yeare 824. and the booke of <hi>Agobardus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lions</hi> concerning <hi>Pictures and Images,</hi> written about the same time; the argument whereof is thus delivered by <hi>Papirius Massonus</hi> the setter out of it. <note n="g" place="margin">Graecorum errores de ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginibus &amp; pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturis manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stissimé dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens, negat eas adorari debere: quam sententi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am omnes Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholici proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Gregorij<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Magni testimoniu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> de illis sequimur. <hi>Papir.

For with them that understand what they speake, <hi>assistance</hi> hath refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the doing of the worke, not to the receiving of the reward: and simply to say, that a man <hi>for his meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious workes</hi> (taking <hi>merit</hi> here as the Romanists in this question would have it taken) <hi>receiveth through Gods grace the blisse of everlasting happinesse</hi>; is to speake flat contrarieties, and to conjoine those things, that cannot possibly be coupled together. For that conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Bernard</hi> is most certaine: <note n="a" place="margin">Non est in quo gratia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tret, ubi jam meritum occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pavit. <hi>Bernard. in Cantic.

                  <hi>There is no place for grace to enter, where merit hath taken possession.</hi> because it is grounded upon the Apostles determination, Rom. 11.6. <hi>If it be of grace, it is no more of workes: or else were grace no more grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither doe we therefore take away the <hi>reward,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we deny the <hi>merit</hi> of good workes.

But the question is, whence he that <hi>soweth</hi> in this manner, must expect to reape so <hi>great</hi> and so <hi>sure</hi> a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest? Whether from Gods <hi>justice</hi>; which he must doe
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:19547:259"/>
if hee stand as the Iesuites would have him doe upon merit: or from his <hi>mercie</hi>; as a recompence freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed out of Gods gracious bountie, and not in justice due for the worth of the worke performed. Which question, we thinke, the Prophet <hi>Hosea</hi> hath sufficiently resolved; when he biddeth us <hi>sow to our selves in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,</hi> and <hi>reape in</hi> MERCIE, Hose. 10.12. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe we hereby any whit detract from the truth of that axiome, That <hi>God will give every man acccording to his works:</hi> for still the question remaineth the very same; whether God may not judge a man according to his workes, when he sitteth upon the <hi>throne of grace,</hi> as well as when he sitteth upon the <hi>throne of justice?</hi> and wee thinke here, that the Prophet <hi>David</hi> hath fully cleared the case, in that one sentence, Psal. 62.12. <hi>With thee, O Lord, is</hi> MERCY: <hi>for thou rewardest every one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his worke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Originally therefore, and in it selfe, we hold that this reward proceedeth meerely from Gods free bountie and <hi>mercie</hi>: but accidentally, in regard that God hath tied himselfe by his word and promise to conferre such a reward, we grant that it now proveth in a sort to be an act of <hi>justice.</hi> even as in <hi>forgiving of our sins</hi> (which in it selfe all men know to be an act of <hi>mercie)</hi> he is said to be <hi>faithfull</hi> and <hi>just,</hi> 1 Ioh. 1.9. namely, in regard of the faithfull performance of his promise. For promise, we see, amongst honest men is counted a due debt. but the thing promised being free, and on our part altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther undeserved, if the promiser did not performe, and proved not to be so good as his word; he could not properly be said to doe me wrong, but rather to wrong himself, by impairing his own credit.

by the good acts or uses which God hath given us, God is not bound to us by any debt of justice to give any thing more, so as if he did not give it he should be unjust; but we are rather bound to God. And to thinke or say the contrary, is rashnesse or blasphemie.</hi>

It now remaineth on his part, that he make good what he hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken:

namely, that <hi>for the confirmation of all the above mentioned points of his Religion,</hi> he produce both <hi>good and certaine grounds out of the sacred Scriptures,</hi> and the generall consent likewise of <hi>the Saints and Fathers of the Primitive Church.</hi> Wherein, as I advise him to spare his paines in labouring to prove those things, which he seeth me before hand readily to have yeelded unto: so I wish him also not to forget his owne motion, made in the percloase of his Challenge; that all <hi>may be done with Christian charity and sincerity, to the glory of God, and instruction of them that are astray.</hi>
