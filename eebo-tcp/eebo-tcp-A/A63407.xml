         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If the Ship be kept in good order within,

I remark, That it depended much
on the <hi>Tribunus Plebis,</hi> or Lord Mayor of the

by him that the Enemies or Friends of the

            <q>—Non omnis fert omnia Tellus.</q>
            <p>And the truth of it is, thoſe Ancient Philoſophers,
who have firſt laid the Foundations of Arts, Sciences,
and Commonwealths in the World, were Travellers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
theſe very Eaſtern Parts, (partly deſcribed by us

            <p>Yet it may be truly ſaid, That Ancient Travellers

Relations of thoſe Countries they deſcrib'd unto us, in

do but copy their Predeceſſors Stories; and Merchants,

account of the ſame to the World.</p>
            <p>But among all the Ancient and Modern Travellers,
none had ſuch fair Opportunities and Advantages as the
Illuſtrious Monſieur <hi>Tavernier</hi> had, to make a true,
profitable, and exact Relation of the Singularities of
thoſe Remote Parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> where he paſt ſo many
<pb facs="tcp:103159:5"/>
Years in great Splendour, as ſhall appear by the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Conſiderations and Qualifications of a good Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He from his Youth had a ſtrong Inclination to
Travel, which ſecret Inſtinct is certainly a Preordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God for an Undertaking; and this unſeen Impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
carries ſuch extraordinary Inſtruments chearfully
and proſperouſly through all the Difficulties, others of a
contrary diſpoſition would never wade thorough, for
whom it would be in vain to ſtrive againſt the current of
Nature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Travelling <hi>Genius</hi> made him begin early
to fit himſelf for his deſign, and ſoon to go about it. He
was therefore ſufficiently imbued in his Intellectuals with
all due knowledge of Sciences, Language, and Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
and precedent Travellers Maps and Books, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all which common Travellers cannot conceive ſo ſoon
and ſo orderly, nor reap ſo much benefit for themſelves or
others.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But Speculations without Experience are but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
Notions; and the Experiments of this kind
are not to be had without <hi>great Means and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,</hi>
for want of which many a good Undertaking is
Still-born.
<q>
                  <l>Haud facilè emergunt, quorum virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus
obſtat</l>
                  <l>Res anguſta domi—</l>
               </q>
               <pb facs="tcp:103159:6"/>
is an old and true Saying. But our noble <hi>Tavernier</hi>
had an ample Eſtate, drove a great Trade, had Money
in abundance, and a Prince's or Embaſſador-like Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
without which and great Preſents none is ſcarce
look'd upon in Luxurious <hi>Aſia,</hi> fit for admittance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
great and worthy Companies, where Knowledge may
be attained; ſo that he thereby ſoon got into the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
Familiarity, and Cloſets of the Emperours, the
Miniſters of State, and the Philoſophers of <hi>Perſia,
Mogol,</hi> &amp;c. and got into the Acquaintance and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations
of the leading and common Merchants, Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiquers,
and People; and knew their Languages very
well: for it is in vain to have Eyes, if one have not alſo
a Tongue in ſuch caſes.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And whereas Learning and Riches do ſometimes
render narrow Souls of a more proud and unſociable
temper, Monſieur <hi>Tavernier</hi> is by Nature and Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
an obliging, cheerful, and inſinuating Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
and of a graceful Countenance. Comely Perſonages
are beloved almoſt as ſoon as they are ſeen; and thoſe
that have but fair Souls, are not ſo till after they are
known. Now Monſieur <hi>Tavernier</hi> having both theſe
Advantages, had a free entrance into the Friendſhip
and Notions the <hi>Indians</hi> (great or ſmall) had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Natural, Mechanical, Political, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and Trading State of their own Countrey; which he
made more his buſineſs to know, than to grow more rich.
<pb facs="tcp:103159:6"/>
And at ſome times he would reckon Thouſands of Pounds
as nothing to attain his ends in this point of Knowledge
and further Experience; as the peruſal of this his own
Work, and Perſons now in <hi>London,</hi> that knew him in
and after his Travels, can fully teſtifie.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Moreover, Mutual Help of Perſons equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
and curious, is a great advantage in ſuch
Reſearches and Obſervations as theſe. Now <hi>John
Baptiſta Tavernier,</hi> beſides many other Heads and
Hands, had herein the Aſſiſtance of a Brother, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
a Traveller as himſelf in thoſe furtheſt Parts of
<hi>Aſia,</hi> and had no leſs the foregoing Qualifications in
Perſon and Eſtate than this his Brother <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſta</hi>
had, as the Reader may well perceive by this Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
of Travels.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And as for the <hi>Time;</hi> Six Voyages, and about
Forty Years Abode in thoſe Countries they do deſcribe,
did render theſe Brethrens Knowledge vaſt, their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
tried over and over, and this their Account
more ſure and exact (as I ſaid) than that of any other
Traveller heretofore.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And finally, to confirm the undoubted Credit
that's to be given to this Nobleman and his Relation,
(who is above all deſign of Flattering or Deceiving the
Reader) you may meet with ſeveral Worthy Perſons
in this City and the Court of <hi>England;</hi> and I my ſelf,
who was at <hi>Paris</hi> ſome few years ago at Monſieur
<pb facs="tcp:103159:7"/>
               <hi>Tavernier</hi>'s Arrival, and who can witneſs the grand
Eſteem, the ſolemn Honours and Thanks, that were
then given him by Perſons of all Ranks and Degrees,
the <hi>French Eaſt India</hi> Company's Admiration and
Recommendation of him, that he had done his King
and Countrey more Credit in thoſe proud Eaſtern
Courts than ever any did before him; the <hi>French</hi>
King's imploying of him there; the Rarities he
brought home to the Learned; the vaſt Riches and
Memoirs he gained for himſelf, and the incomparable
Jewels and Singularities he brought to the <hi>French</hi>
King; the Titles of <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Baron</hi> conferred upon
him extraordinarily, though he were a Merchant and
a ſtrict Proteſtant. Theſe (I ſay) Public and Private
Teſtimonials do ſhew what Credit other Nations and
his own (which is Singular) had given to him. But
in a word his own Obſervations herein gathered will
prove it better.</p>
            <p>But if any deſire to have ſome Account of the Work
it ſelf, the Newneſs, Profit, and Satisfaction the very
Subject muſt needs yield to all Perſons and Profeſſions
cannot but be acceptable.</p>
            <p>The Naturaliſt ſhall have Plants, Minerals, Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
and <hi>Phoenomena's</hi> never ſeen in our Climate.
And about Phyſic, the Law, Muſic, and Poetry, more
<pb facs="tcp:103159:7"/>
Time and Tryals are required in thoſe Countries than
here; and you ſhall accordingly read of Cures done that
draw near to natural Miracles.</p>
            <p>The Divine will ſee things worth his Obſervation in
their Religion and Morals, wherein they may confound
the very Chriſtians; whereof I'le onely touch but thus
much: That by the Light of Nature thoſe Heathens
own a Supreme Deity, and a Future State of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Torments; and do in view of the ſame moſt
ſtrictly keep the Civil and the Ten Moral Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
much anſwerable to ours, which their Prophets
have left to them. So that they puniſh Murther and
Adultery even in<note n="*" place="margin">Tunquin ch. 7. p. 18.</note> Princes and Princeſſes; terrible
Examples whereof you may here read at large. And
the Church and State Government are ſubſervient in a
Subordination, the one being a Prop to the other.</p>
            <p>Even Stateſmen may find Subject of weighty conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
in the Antiquity, Model, and Exactneſs of their
Government. As for inſtance: Though they have a
ſpecial regard to Monarchy, ſo as to keep the Succeſſion
within the ſame Line; yet the<note n="*" place="margin">Tunquin c. 11. p. 35.</note> Great Conſtable, and
the King's Council have Power left them to propoſe and
chuſe the fitteſt Perſon among the Royal Children, or Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral
Succeſſors, who is nominated in the King's
Life-time, to prevent after Diſturbances. They have
<pb facs="tcp:103159:8"/>
alſo on the other ſide very ſingular and unimitable ways
to prevent the Inſurrections, Diviſions, and Rebellions
of the <hi>Militia</hi> and the People.</p>
            <p>But above all, the Traveller and Traffiquer into
thoſe Parts will be like to run into a thouſand Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences,
and Loſſes of Health, Life, and Eſtate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being guided by ſuch Directions as he carefully gives
herein, which others cannot poſſibly ſo ſoon and ſo well
know.</p>
            <p>It is in fine herein declared, by what means the
<hi>French, Holland,</hi> and <hi>Portugal Eaſt India</hi>
Companies were Settled, Improved, and Worſted in
thoſe Countries; alſo the Coinage, and the Reduction
thereof to ours; the particular places where all ſorts
of <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Commodities are beſt and cheapeſt had;
the Rates and Exchange Returns are here to be found;
the manner how to know their Falſifications in Gold, Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
Jewels, Drugs, Silks, Linen, and all the other
Merchandizes which are brought from thoſe Nations
are here ſet down: It being otherwiſe hard or impoſſible
to eſcape the Cheats of the <hi>Perſians, Chineſes,</hi> and
<hi>Japoners,</hi> without ſuch Inſtructions.</p>
            <p>I'le ſay no more, but that in this Work was imployed
the Help of another Worthy Gentleman, who labour'd
<pb facs="tcp:103159:8"/>
in the firſt Volum of <hi>Tavernier</hi>'s Tranſlation; but it
was brought to an end and perfection by me, who had
the occaſion to be more particularly acquainted with
Monſieur <hi>Tavernier</hi> himſelf, his Native Tongue, and
other Particularities abroad.</p>

and of the Manner how the Author came
to have knowledge thereof.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Kingdom of <hi>Tunquin</hi> has been long
unknown to the People of <hi>Europe;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have they, who have given us Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
thereof, well underſtood the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
as having truſted too much to
defective and fabulous Deſcriptions and
Obſervations. Not that I am willing to be
over ſevere in cenſuring; but ſubmiſſively I am bold to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
That this which I here make Public was extracted out
of my Brother's Writings, of which I had the overlooking in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103159:13"/>
my ſecond Voyage that I made to the <hi>Indies;</hi> and of which
I was the more confident, for that the Author had been
one who had made Eleven or Twelve Voyages from
<hi>Batavia, Bantam,</hi> and <hi>Achem,</hi> to <hi>Tunquin:</hi> Other Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
I collected from the <hi>Tunquineſi</hi> themſelves, with whom
I have had ſeveral Diſcourſes, during the time that I was at
<hi>Batavia</hi> and <hi>Bantam,</hi> where they principally trade. And
that which gave me the more light was this, That thoſe
Merchants ſeveral times bring along with them ſome of
their <hi>Bonze's</hi> or Prieſts, as alſo ſome of their Learned Men
to teach their Children to Write and Read. For theſe Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
when they make a Voyage by Sea, carry all their
Families along with them. And from theſe <hi>Bonze's</hi> and
other Learned Men I had ſeveral Obſervations and Memoirs
in Writing, as being deſirous to be inform'd by me of the
Government and Situation of our <hi>France.</hi> And as I was
never without an <hi>Atlas</hi> and ſome other particular Maps, they
were raviſh'd with admiration, when I ſhew'd them the
Structure and Compoſure of the whole World, and the
Situation of its ſeveral Kingdoms and Eſtates.</p>
               <p>Therefore may the Reader with the more pleaſure and
delight peruſe theſe Relations, when he has ſo much reaſon
to be perſuaded that they are cordially done, and that they
are made public by a perſon whoſe ſincerity has no deſign
to abuſe him. My Brother, who was a perſon both cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and couragious, and one that lov'd to Travel as well
as my ſelf, having heard much talk in the <hi>Indies</hi> of the
Grandeur of the Kingdom of <hi>Tunquin,</hi> reſolv'd to go thither,
and as he had a particular gift to learn a Language in a little
time, he ſoon grew familiar with the <hi>Malaye,</hi> which is the
Language of the Learned in thoſe quarters of <hi>Aſia,</hi> as <hi>Latin</hi>
is among Us in <hi>Europe.</hi> He underſtood that Silk, Musk, and
other Commodities of the like nature, were much cheaper
there then in other places adjoyning, and that the People
dealt with more fairneſs and honeſty. Upon the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of which Information he prepar'd a Ship, and made
his Voyages with good ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>He always carri'd with him a good Sum of Money; and
more then that, he ſtor'd himſelf with a conſiderable number
of ſmall Curioſities, to preſent the King and his Nobility,
according to the general Cuſtom of all the Eaſtern Countries:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103159:13"/>
Thus he came to be well receiv'd the firſt time that he ſet
foot in the Country; ſo that the Cuſtomer being by him
oblig'd with a ſmall Clock; a pair of ſmall Piſtols, and two
Pictures, which were the Pictures of two <hi>Curteſans,</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
gave notice to the King of his arrival. Thereupon
having order to attend the Court, and coming to kiſs the
King's hands, the whole Aſſembly was ſurpris'd to hear a
Stranger, born in a Country ſo far diſtant, ſpeak the <hi>Malaye</hi>
Language ſo fluently. The King gave him a favourable
reception, and kindly receiv'd the Preſent which he brought
along with him. It was a very noble Sword, of which the
Handle and Hilt were all over enchac'd with Rubies and
Emraulds, with a Backſword Blade. To this he added a
pair of Piſtols, adorn'd and inlaid with Silver, a <hi>Perſian</hi>
Saddle and Bridle, embroider'd with Gold and Silver, a
Bow and Quiver full of Arrows, and ſix Pictures, like thoſe
which he had given the Cuſtomer. Theſe things highly
pleas'd the King, who preſently drew forth the Sword out
of the Scabbard, the better to look upon and conſider it. At
length one of his Sons took it up, to try whether it would
fit his hand as well as thoſe of his own Country, and offer'd
to make a blow. My Brother, ſeeing the young Prince
handle the Weapon gracefully enough, after the manner of
the Country, told the King, that if he pleas'd, he would
ſhow the King how they handled that Weapon in <hi>France,</hi>
of which the King readily conſented to be a Spectatour.</p>
               <p>This was my Brother's firſt Reception at Court; for he
made ſeveral Voyages to <hi>Tunquin,</hi> and every time that he
return'd, they ſtill the more and more obligingly entertain'd
him. But that which fix'd him more in the good opinion
and favour of the King and Lords of the Court, was his
<gap reason="illegible: broken" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>olic and gentile behaviour in playing with them for ſeveral
large Sums, inſomuch that being one that ventur'd deep;
he loſt above 20000 Crowns in one Voyage. However
the King, who was a generous Prince, would not ſuffer him
to be a loſer, but gave him thoſe conſiderable Preſents that
ſuppli'd his loſſes. By means of my Brother's thus long
ſojourning in <hi>Tunquin,</hi> and the familiar acquaintance which
he had at Court, together with the Trade which he drove
in the Kingdom, as he was diligent to inform himſelf of all
the Curioſities of the Country, it was eaſie for me upon
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103159:14"/>
the ſame foundation to lay the Structure of theſe Memoirs.
Though I may ſafely ſay, I was no leſs laborious in my
own particular, and by the frequent Diſcourſes which I had
with a great number of the <hi>Tunquineſes,</hi> with whom I met
both at <hi>Bantam</hi> and <hi>Batavia</hi> that came thither to Trade, and
whom I often treated at my own Expences, to inform
my ſelf of the particular Ceremonies and Cuſtoms of their
Country.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the Grounds and Foundations of this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is both faithful and exact, and by which that
noble Country, of which the Deſcriptions hitherto have
been ſo obſcure and uncertain, ſhall be truly diſcover'd and
ſet forth, ſuch as it is; declaring withal, that no other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
or Intereſt, then that of ſpeaking truth, has incited
me to undertake this Deſcription.</p>
               <p>For the better obſervation of a right Method in purſuance
of this Relation, and to conduct the Reader <hi>gradatim</hi> to
the more perfect knowledge of this Kingdom, I will ſpeak
firſt of its Situation, its Extent, and its Climate. Next I
ſhall come to diſcourſe of its Qualities, its Riches, and its
Trade, which are the three Springs and Sources of the
Strength and Force of a Nation. Next I ſhall give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Cuſtoms and Manners of the People as well in
their particular OEconomy and Civil Society, as in relation
to their Marriages, their Viſits and Feſtivals. Next to this
we ſhall give a brief Account of the Learning, and learned
Men, and among them of their Phyſicians, and the Subject
of their Art, that is to ſay, of the Diſeaſes particular to the
Country. We ſhall alſo give a Relation of the Original of
the Government and Policy of the Kingdom of <hi>Tunquin,</hi> of
the Condition of the Court, of the Inauguration and Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
of their Kings, and in the laſt place of the Original of
the Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>And I dare ingage, that the Map of the Country, and the
Cuts which were drawn upon the place, will no leſs contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to the Divertiſement of the Reader, then to the Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Matter which they contain.</p>

               <p>WE ſhall have the leſs reaſon to admire where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Predeceſſors had ſo little knowledge
of this Kingdom, when we conſider that
having formerly been a conſiderable part of <hi>China,</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
in the ſame manner as the <hi>Chineſes</hi> did, kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
cloſe within their own bounds, never minding to
have any Commerce with other People, whom they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd
and lookt upon as <hi>Barbarians</hi> come from the other
part of the World. But now that they find that Strangers
come to find them out in their own Territories, they begin
to ſee that other People have as good Government as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
which has bred in them a deſire to Converſe and
Trade with Foreigners; ſo that now they aſſociate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in friendly manner with all other People, as I have
obſerv'd them to do both at <hi>Batavia</hi> and <hi>Bantam.</hi> Moſt
people believe this Country to lye in a very hot Climate;
nevertheleſs it is now known to be very temperate, by
reaſon of the great number of Rivers that water it; which,
together with the Rains that fall in their Seaſons, cauſe a
brisk freſhneſs of the Air; which indeed happ'ns moſt
uſually over all the <hi>Torrid-zone,</hi> as I have obſerv'd in my
<hi>Indian Travels.</hi> From whence we may alſo have reaſon
to believe the Country to be very fruitful and thick inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited.</p>
               <p>To the Eaſt this Kingdom lies upon the Province of <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
one of the beſt of <hi>China.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the Weſt it is bounded by the Kingdom of <hi>Brama.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the North it borders upon two other Provinces of
<hi>China, Junnan</hi> and <hi>Quanſi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the South it lies upon <hi>Cochinchina,</hi> and the great Gulph
of the ſame name.</p>
               <p>To return to the Climate, the Air is ſo mild and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate,
that all the year long ſeems to be but one continual
Spring; Froſt and Snow are never there to be ſeen; and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103159:15"/>
beſides, the Peſtilence, the Gout, the Stone, and other
Diſeaſes ſo frequent in <hi>Europe,</hi> there are never known. There
are but two Winds, which divide the whole Year between
them; the one blowing from the North, the other from
the South, and both continuing the ſame for ſix months
together. The firſt refreſhes the Earth in that manner, that
there is nothing ſo delightful as the Country of <hi>Tunquin.</hi>
The other begins to blow from the end of <hi>January</hi> to the
end of <hi>July;</hi> and the two laſt months are their months
of rain. The greateſt inconvenience is, that there
ariſe once in ſeaven years, as well in this Country as
in other parts of the <hi>Indies,</hi> thoſe hideous and terrible
Tempeſts, that blow down Houſes, tear up Trees
by the roots, and make ſtrange Deſolations. They ſeldom
laſt above four and twenty hours, nor are their ſad Effects
to be felt but only upon the Seas of <hi>China, Japon, Cochin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>china,
Tunquin,</hi> and the <hi>Manilles,</hi> being rarely known in any
other Seas.</p>
               <p>The Aſtrologers of thoſe parts believe that theſe terrible
Tempeſts proceed from the Exhalations that riſe out of the
Mines of <hi>Japon.</hi> It comes with that ſuddain force that when
it ſurprizes a Veſſel out at Sea, the Pilots have no other
remedy then to cut down all the Maſts, that the ſtorm
may have the leſs force upon the Ship.</p>
               <p>In this fair extent of Land, almoſt equal to that of <hi>France,</hi>
are ſeveral Provinces, whoſe limmits are not well known;
the <hi>Tunquineſes</hi> being no great Geographers, nor having bin
over curious to write the Annals of the Nation. But the
moſt underſtanding and knowing among them aſſur'd me at
<hi>Batavia,</hi> that the whole Kingdom contain'd above twenty
thouſand Cities and Towns. They alſo affirm'd that there
might be many more, but after the manner of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
the <hi>Cochinchineſes,</hi> many of the People chooſe rather to
upon the Water then upon the Land; ſo that you ſhall ſee
live the greateſt part of their Rivers covered with Boates,
which ſerve them inſtead of Houſes; and which are very
neat, though they alſo keep their Cattel in them.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Quality of the Kingdom of Tunquin.</head>
               <p>THis Country for the moſt part is a level Extent,
which riſes up and down into pleaſant Hillocks;
the greateſt Hills which it has lying to the North.
It is water'd by ſeveral Rivers which inter-cut and glide
through the Country: ſome of which carry Galleys of
good burthen, and large Shallps, very commodious for
trade. Yet in all the Country there grows neither Corn
nor Wine, by reaſon of the want of rain, which never falls
but in the Months of <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July.</hi> But it bears an infinite
quantity of Rice, which is the chief ſuſtenance of the
People. Of this Rice alſo they make their Drink, beſides
which they have good <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi> or Strong-water. Their
Fruits are excellent, but much different from ours, as are alſo
the Trees that bear them. The chiefeſt of theſe Trees are
the Palm-tree, which bears a Fruit bigger then in any part
of <hi>Aſia.</hi> The Nut is about the bigneſs of a Man's Head,
in ſhape like a <hi>Coco</hi>-nut; the Shell is very hard, and being
open'd, the Pulp within is as white as Snow, having a taſt
like our Almonds, and every one of the Fruits contains
about two glaſsfuls of Liquor, very refreſhing and pleaſing
to the Palate. The <hi>Gogavier,</hi> very much reſembles our
Lawrel, of which there are two ſorts; the one bears a
Plum, green without and red within: but the Fruit of the
other Tree, which is in much more eſteem, is yellowiſh
without and white within, the top of the Fruit being like a
ſmall Noſegay: the Pulp is full of ſmall Kernels, leſs then
thoſe of a Pomegranate; and if they be eaten before they
are ripe they bind the belly, whereas being eaten when
they are come to full maturity they work a contrary effect.
Formerly this Fruit was not known in the Kingdom of <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin,</hi>
but after the <hi>Portugals</hi> ſeated themſelves at <hi>Macao,</hi> they
carri'd ſeveral Plants thither, ſo that now the Fruit is grown
very common. The <hi>Papager</hi> bears a Fruit which very much
reſembles a ſmall Melon, the taſt whereof is very delicious.
The <hi>Arager</hi> grows upright and ſtreight, like the Maſt of a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103159:16"/>
Ship, bearing no Branches but at the top; which makes it
appear like a Crown. The Fruit which it produces is like a
Nutmeg, but a little more round. The People break this
Nut, and bruiſing it together with <hi>Betlè</hi> leaves, mix both with
a little Chalk, and make uſe of the Powder to keep their
Teeth clean, to dye their Lips of a Vermilion colour, and to
keep their Breath ſweet.</p>
               <p>They have but two ſorts of Figs, the one like ours, and
the other like thoſe which are call'd <hi>Adam</hi>'s Figs, as long as a
Man's finger.</p>
               <p>There is alſo another Tree, very like our <hi>Willow,</hi> which
they call the <hi>Powder Tree,</hi> becauſe that of the Wood they
make Charcoal, and of the Coal a Powder which they make
uſe of in their Wars.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jambager</hi> is another Tree, that grows very high,
which bears a Fruit about the bigneſs of a Citrul-Cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
the Pulp whereof is full of Kernels like a Granate, very
cooling and pleaſant, and very frequently eaten in the Seaſon
of heat.</p>
               <p>The High-ways are alſo planted with Trees on both ſides
for the convenience of Travellers: And there are ſome of
theſe Trees ſo big that two or three thouſand men may ſtand
under them, like that at <hi>Ormus,</hi> or <hi>Bandar Abaſſi,</hi> by me
deſcrib'd in my Relations of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and of which many
other Travellers have made mention. When the Branches
of theſe Trees are about ten or twelve foot long, there iſſue
forth other little Branches which turn downward, and by
little and little deſcending to the ground, take root and
afterwards become as it were ſo many Pillars to ſupport the
<hi>Maſter</hi>-Branches. There are ſome of the <hi>Maſter</hi>-Branches
three hundred Paces long, which are ſupported by theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growing
Branches at the diſtance of every ten or twelve
foot. The Fruit is of the bigneſs of one of our great Nuts,
the Shell whereof is red, containing within nothing but a
Kernel like a grain of Millet. The Rere Mice feed upon 'em,
and alſo make their Neſts in the trees. Theſe Rere-mice
are as big as a good Pullet, inſomuch that their Wings are
above a foot and a half long. They never light upon the
tree like other Birds, but you ſhall ſee them all the day long
hanging at the branches of the trees, faſten'd by their Claws
to the tree with their heads downward. Upon every Wing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103159:16"/>
they have ſeven as it were little Hooks or Claws, ſo that
being ſhot, they never fall to the ground, but remain fixed
to the branches, that at a diſtance you would take them to be
ſome great Pears that hung upon the tree. They are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
a great dainty among the <hi>Portugals,</hi> who leave their
Pullets to eat them. 'Tis true that their Fleſh is very white,
and when they are young they are a delicate ſort of Diet.
I happen'd to eat of them two or three times with the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals,</hi>
who thought they had oblig'd me with a great dainty;
and had I not known what they were, I ſhould have taken
them for Pullets. And now I am talking of the Delicacies
of the Country, I will tell you of one ſort of Dyet which
is very ſingular. This Food is the Neſt of a certain Bird
which is no where to be found, but in the four Iſlands that
lie upon the Coaſt of <hi>Cochinchina,</hi> and of which you have
the Figures in the Table <hi>A, B, C, D.</hi> Theſe Birds are about
the bigneſs of a Swallow, and build their Neſts in ſuch a
manner, that they are neither too cloſe compacted, nor alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
tranſparent; they are like an Onion compos'd of
ſeveral rings and envelopings; that compoſe a Neſt of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſort of <hi>Gunim,</hi> which is ſteep'd in warm water, and mix'd
with all the Sawces which are made both for Fiſh and Fleſh.
It is tranſported all over <hi>India</hi> and into <hi>Holland</hi> for Curioſitie's
ſake. You would believe in eating thoſe Meats which are
ſeaſon'd therewith, that thoſe Neſts were compos'd of all
the Spices in the Orient. I have not only brought this Diet
into <hi>France,</hi> and preſented of it to ſeveral Perſons of Quality,
but I have alſo my Vouchers for the truth of what I relate,
ſeveral of my Friends who have brought it from <hi>Holland,</hi>
among the reſt <hi>M. de Villermont,</hi> whoſe Name is famous for
his Travels into the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi> He and all thoſe that have
eat thereof agree with me, that all the Spices of the <hi>Eaſt</hi>
put together, do not give that effectual reliſh and ſavour
as theſe Neſts do, to the Meats and Diſhes wherein they
are us'd.</p>
               <p>Near to theſe four Iſlands, where theſe Birds Neſts are
found, are five others mark'd in the Map 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
In theſe five Iſlands are ſuch infinite number of <hi>Tortoiſes,</hi> and
ſuch excellent Food, that the <hi>Tunquineſes</hi> and <hi>Cochinchineſes</hi> do
not believe they have entertain'd their Friends at a Banquet
as they ought to do, till the <hi>Tortoiſes</hi> are brought in. Thoſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103159:17"/>
two Nations pickle up great quantities of them, and ſend
them abroad, which is a vaſt trade among them; and indeed
the chiefeſt occaſion of the Wars between them is, becauſe
the <hi>Cochinchineſes</hi> do all they can to hinder the <hi>Tunquineſes</hi> to
fiſh for them, alledging that thoſe Seas and Iſlands belong
to them. Neither is the Meat but the Shell alſo of great
eſteem, and one of the greateſt Commodities for Trade in
<hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tunquin</hi> alſo affords great ſtore of <hi>Anana's</hi> and Orange
trees, of which there are of two ſorts: the one that bears
a Fruit no bigger then an <hi>Abricot;</hi> the other bigger then
thoſe of <hi>Portugal:</hi> both alike in taſt, and being to be gather'd
from the tree for ſix months together. They have alſo two
ſorts of Citrons, the one yellow, the other green; but both
the one and the other ſo tart and ſow'r, that they cannot be
eaten without offence to the Stomach. Nevertheleſs, the
Juyce is made uſe of as we do here of <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> to cleanſe
Copper, Tin, and Iron, before we gild thoſe Metals, as
alſo for Tinctures, eſpecially thoſe of Silk. They are alſo
made uſe of for Lyes to whiten Linnen, and to take out
Spots. Through all the Territories of the <hi>Great Mogul</hi> they
make uſe of this Juyce of Citrons to whiten their Calicuts;
whereby they make them ſometimes ſo white that they dazle
the ſight.</p>
               <p>They make great quantities of Silk in the Kingdom of
<hi>Tunquin,</hi> of which both rich and poor make themſelves
Garments. The <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who thruſt themſelves in every
where, where there is any hope of gain, carry off ſuch a
quantity every year, that it is now become the chiefeſt part
of that Commodity which they carry to <hi>Japon;</hi> whereas
before they fetch'd their Commodities from <hi>Perſia, Bengala,</hi>
or <hi>China.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for ſweet ſmelling Flow'rs, the <hi>Tunquineſes</hi> have but
one ſort, which they call the Flow'r of <hi>Bague.</hi> It grows
like a large Noſegay, and the Branches of the Shrub that
bear it, ſpread themſelves crawlingly upon the ground. As
they have great ſtore of Sugar, ſo they eat very much, while
it is yet in the Cane, not having the true Art to refine it: and
that which they do groſly refine, they make into little Loaves
weighing about half a pound. They eat very much, making
uſe of it always after Meals to help digeſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:103159:17"/>
Through the whole Kingdom are neither Lions, Aſſes,
nor Sheep; but the Foreſts are full of Tigers, Harts, and
Apes, and the Fields are full of Beeves, Cows, and Hogs.
As for Hens, Ducks, and Turtles, they are not to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd,
which is the general Proviſion for their Feſtivals.
Their Horſes are very well ſhap'd; of which there are
always five or ſix hunder'd in the King's Stables; He alſo
keeps the ſame number of Elephants, of which ſome are
for the Service of his Houſe, the reſt bred for the Wars.
Theſe Elephants are of a prodigious bigneſs, neither are
there any ſo tall nor ſo nimble in any part of <hi>Aſia;</hi> for they
will bow themſelves, and ſtoop ſo low, that you may get
upon their backs without help. They have no Cats, but
they have Dogs that ſerve for the ſame purpoſe, and will
watch all night to kill the Rats and Mice, which are very
large and very troubleſom. Very few Birds are to be ſeen
in the Air, which toward the evening grows duskiſh, by
reaſon of thoſe vaſt number of Gnats that get into the
Houſes in the night time and hinder people from ſleeping,
not only by the noiſe which they make, but with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
ſtinging; which is one of the greateſt inconveniencies
of the Country. For remedy whereof in ſome meaſure,
an hour before they go to ſleep they take the Husk or Chaff
of the Rice, which flies from the Rice when it is beaten, and
ſtrew it upon a ſmall Fire in a Fire-ſhovel, and ſo let it ſmoak,
and by that means they kill or drive thoſe Flies away. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
this, they cover the Bed with a Pavilion or Tent that
trails upon the ground, made like a Net with very ſmall
holes to let in the Air. But notwithſtanding all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
can be us'd, they will be about a man when he riſes
i' the morning. But there is yet a far greater inconvenience
in this Country, which proceeds from the infinite numbers of
white Emmets, which though they are but little, have teeth
ſo ſharp, that they will eat down a wooden Poſt in a ſhort
time. And if great care be not taken in the place where
you lock up your Bales of Silk, in four and twenty hours
they will eat through a Bale, as if it had been ſaw'd in two in
the middle. Several of them have fallen from the Ciel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into my Neck, where they rais'd Bliſters upon the
Skin, which preſently fall again being waſh'd with cold
Water.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:103159:18"/>
I have told you that Hens and Ducks are infinitely nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
in <hi>Tunquin;</hi> I will now tell you how they preſerve the
Eggs of theſe Creatures, which they will keep for two or three
years together without being ſpoil'd. They ſalt them, and
to make them take ſalt, they fill a Veſſel full of Water, and
throw a good quantity of Salt into it. If the Egg ſink to
the bottom, the Pickle is not good; then they throw in
more Salt, till they find that the Eggs ſwim. The Pickle
being thus made, they take Aſhes, and make them up into
a Paſt with this Pickle: and in this Paſt they encloſe every
Egg by it ſelf, and then wrap it up in a leaf of an Herb,
not unlike one of our Pear-tree leaves, but much larger, and
then put the Eggs into Earthen Pots cloſe cover'd: after
which manner they keep their Eggs for two or three years
together.</p>
               <p>In other parts of the <hi>Indies</hi> where there is great ſtore of
Oyl, as in the Dominions of the <hi>Great Mogul,</hi> the Kingdoms
of <hi>Pegu,</hi> and <hi>Arochan,</hi> they put their Eggs into great Earthen
Pots well varniſh'd, and then fill the Veſſel with an Oyl
which is made of a ſmall Seed like Rape-ſeed. For as for
Sallad Oyl, after you are once paſs'd <hi>Aleppo,</hi> you ſee no more
Olive-trees over all <hi>Aſia,</hi> but only in one place of <hi>Perſia</hi> near
<hi>Casbin,</hi> where between the Mountains lies a little Valley,
about a League long and half a League broad, full of Olive-trees,
but they make but very little Oyl, preſerving the
Olives only to eat. But to return to the Eggs; they are the
chief Proviſion which they eat a Ship-board. But the Eggs
which are preſerv'd in Salt are preferr'd much before thoſe
that are kept in Oyl; becauſe that in uſing the firſt, there is
no need of carrying Salt to Sea, or of boiling Salt with their
Rice. When they eat them, they boil them till they are
hard, and with every mouthful of Rice they eat a Pea's
bigneſs of Egg, which is as good and better then Salt with
their Rice. As to what remains, there are neither Mines of
Gold nor Silver in the Kingdom of <hi>Tunquin,</hi> neither do they
Coin any Money.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Riches, Trade, and Money of the
Kingdom of Tunquin.</head>
               <p>THE chief Riches of the Country of <hi>Tunquin</hi> conſiſt in
the great quantity of Silks which they ſell to the
<hi>Hollanders,</hi> and other Foreigners, and in their <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
Aloes.</hi> Of which there is ſome worth a thouſand Crowns
the Pound, according to its goodneſs and oylineſs. There
is ſome that is not worth above three Crowns, but it is dry
and good for nothing but to make Cabinets, or Beads to
hang about Womens Necks. All the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> eſpecially
ſuch as let their Beards grow, make great account of this
Wood; and when they give a Viſit, they preſently bring a
little Chafing-diſh, and caſt a ſmall piece of this Wood
upon the Coals, which yields a ſmoak and pleaſing miſt;
with which they perfume their Beards, at the ſame time
lifting up their hands to Heaven, and crying, <hi>Elhemed Illah,</hi>
or <hi>God be thanked.</hi> If the Wood be oily, the bigneſs of a Pea
will ſerve to throw upon the fire, which being a little
moiſten'd in Water, will yield as much ſmoak as a dry piece
as big as a Man's fiſt. Which is the reaſon, that if it be
oily and good it wants no price. One of the chief Preſents,
as I have obſerv'd in another part of this Book, which

               <p>It is ſo much the more pleaſure and profit to trade with
the People of <hi>Tunquin,</hi> by how much the more faithful and
frank they are in their dealing then the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> who will
deceive you if they can; ſo that it is a hard thing to be too
cunning for them, as I have often found by experience.
When you have ſold them any Commodity, and they find
that their Bargain is not very advantageous, their general
way of getting off is this: As they have generally three
ſorts of Reals, one ſort that is full weight, others which are
light, four, others eight <hi>per Cent</hi> if they have no mind to
ſtand to their bargain, they offer to pay you for your Goods
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103159:19"/>
in light Reals, which they have clipt themſelves, and ſo
you are deceiv'd. There are no ſuch People for Trade in
the World: they refuſe to deal in nothing, even in old
Shoes, and if you will ſell them but one of them too, they'l
buy it, without ever enquiring why you will not ſell the
other. But for thoſe of <hi>Tunquin</hi> they are more blunt and
plain in their dealing, ſo that it is a pleaſure to have to deal
with them. I have told you, there are neither Mines of
Gold or Silver in <hi>Tunquin,</hi> neither do they Coin Money
there. So that in Trade they make uſe of certain Lingots
of Gold, as they are brought out of <hi>China,</hi> ſome of which
amount to 300 Livers of our Money, others to ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd.
They alſo make uſe of Bars of Silver as they are
brought from <hi>Japon.</hi> As for ſmall Payments they either
cut the large Bars into ſmall pieces, to which purpoſe they
have their Scales, like our <hi>Stelleers;</hi> or elſe they pay in
Foreign Coin, which are the Reals of <hi>Spain</hi> generally. This
Gold and Silver is brought from <hi>China,</hi> and <hi>Japon,</hi> in lieu
of thoſe vaſt quantities of Silk which are exported out of the
Country, which with Musk and <hi>Lignum Aloes</hi> are the chief
Riches of the Kingdom.</p>

               <p>THey who have written before me concerning the
Kingdom of <hi>Tunquin,</hi> have ſpoken largely of its
Forces both by Sea and Land, and allow it a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious

that the Forces which were uſually wont to meet at the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouz
were 12000 Horſe, 2000 Elephants, as well to carry
the King's and the Nobilities Tents and Baggage, as for the
Service of the War, 300000 Foot, and 300 Galleys. And

                           <head>The King of Tunquin's Setting out for
the War.</head>
                           <p>1. The King going out of his Palace is carried in his <hi>Palan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin</hi>
or Chair by the Chief Officers of his Houſhold.</p>
                           <p>2. The Order of the King's March when he goes to the War.</p>
                           <p>3. The Muſicians and Trumpeters who follow his Chair.</p>
                           <p>4. An Officer who carries a Baſon full of Water, on which doth
float a Braſs Boul with a hole in the bottom of it; ſo that exactly in
an hour this Boul becomes full of Water, and ſuddenly ſinks to the
bottom.</p>
                           <p>5. Then preſently two other Officers do ſtrike the Hour upon two
great Braſs Platters, N. 5. of about a Yard Diameter, and much
after the Form of our Burning Glaſſes, yet of the Metall that Bells
are made of, which cauſes that they are heard a very far off.</p>
                           <p>Afterwards he that carries the Baſon of Water takes up the Cup
from the bottom, and ſets it again a ſwimming atop of the Water, juſt
as it was before. When it is full and ſinks, they after the ſame
manner ſtrike on the ſaid Platters. And this is their way of reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Hour and Times in <hi>Tunquin,</hi> as well as in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and
almoſt throughout the Eaſtern Parts betwixt the <hi>Tropicks;</hi> for
that the Clocks which are made in <hi>Europe</hi> become uſeleſs in
thoſe Countries during the Rainy Seaſon, the Air being there ſo
heavy and damp, that all Iron and Steel, nay the very Knives and
Watches in peoples Pockets do grow ruſty, though you wrap them up
never ſo well in Cotton or Leather, and take all the care imaginable
to keep them dry; yet it will be impoſſible otherwiſe to preſerve them
from Ruſt, than by letting them lie in Oyl while that Weather laſts.</p>
                           <p>This Foggy Dampneſs of the Air is predominant as ſoon as you are
paſt <hi>Perſia,</hi> in all the <hi>Mogol</hi>'s Countrey, from the Fifteenth of <hi>June</hi>
to the end of <hi>September.</hi> The further one goes on toward the Eaſt,
the later theſe Rains do begin and are met withall.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb facs="tcp:103159:20"/>
It's good likewiſe to obſerve, that in the Empire of the Great
<hi>Mogul,</hi> in <hi>Tunquin,</hi> and in other Eaſterly Parts between the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks,</hi>
they do as we divide the Day and Night into 24 Hours, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Day of 12, and the Night to be of as much; ſo to proportion
equally the Times of Working and of Reſt. But they do ſubdivide
both the Day and the Night into 4 equal parts, and this Diviſion is
made known by the Strokes given upon thoſe Platters. As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample:
The firſt Hour of the firſt Watch of the Night is mark'd by
one Blow, the ſecond by another, and the third likewiſe by another.
In the ſecond Watch of the Night the firſt Hour is made known by
two Blows one after another, and ſo of the reſt untill the third Watch;
then at the firſt Hour of that they give three Strokes. And this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is obſerved till the laſt Hour of the fourth Watch, which is mark'd
by four Knocks. In this manner they continue to marck the firſt
Hour of the day with the ſame Regularity.</p>
                           <p>All Perſons of Quality do keep Eight Officers on purpoſe for this
Imploy; who likewiſe are to have a care of keeping the Palace Gates.
This Engine for the marking of the Hours is ordinarily hung up at the
Entry of great Palaces near the Porter's Lodge.</p>

ſaw in the year 1649, when the King was preparing to
make War againſt the King of <hi>Cochinchina,</hi> for certain Ships
which the <hi>Cochinchineſes</hi> had taken from the <hi>Tunquineſes:</hi>
though the Quarrel was taken up by certain Embaſſadors
which the King of <hi>Cochinchina</hi> ſent to the King of <hi>Tunquin,</hi> to
whom the former made ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>The Army that was then prepar'd to march upon this
Expedition was compos'd of 8000 Horſe, 94 thouſand Foot,
and 722 Elephants; 130 for the War, and the reſt to carry the
Tents and Baggage of the King and the Nobility; and 318
Galleys and Barks, very long and narrow, with Oars and
Sails; and this was that which my Brother ſaw. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Souldiery is very toilſom and laborious, and
of little advantage in the Kingdom of <hi>Tunquin.</hi> For they
are all their life time ſo ti'd and engag'd to the Service of
the Wars, that though they are capable of other Labours
for the ſupport of their Families, they are not permitted to
undertake it. Thoſe days that they are not upon the Guard,
they are oblig'd to attend their Captains where-ever they
go, and two days in a week they are compell'd to Exerciſe
with their Bows and Arrows in their preſence. Their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
conſiſt of a hundred or a hundred and thirty Men;
and they of each Company that have made the beſt ſhot,
have one of them two Months Wages, the other one, which
is paid them in Rice. He that makes the worſt ſhot, next
time he mounts the Guard, is oblig'd to ſtand Centinel
double his time. All the Captains look upon it as a great
piece of glory to have their Souldiers Arms and Weapons
neat and bright. If they find any ruſt upon them, they
ſconce them eight days Wages for the firſt fault, and for the
ſecond they are very ſeverely chaſtis'd. As for thoſe that
ſerve in the Galleys, they are entertain'd and liſted propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably.
And ſometimes the Captains ſend their Souldiers
aboard for ſome days, that they may learn to row. For it
is one of the chiefeſt Paſtimes of the Kings of <hi>Tunquin</hi> to ſee
the Mock-fights of the Galleys. When he has a mind to
delight himſelf with this Divertiſment, the King, with ſome
part of his Court, removes to one of his fair Palaces, that
ſtands upon one of the largeſt Rivers in his Country; and
it is a great Honour for any of the Captains whoſe Souldiers
carry the Victory. Now as the Victory is only got by the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103159:25"/>
force of the Oars, it happens ſometimes that there are ſome
Souldiers who ſtrain themſelves ſo hard, that they fall down
dead with the Oar in their hands: for the King is the only
Judge of the Combat. Wherein the pleaſure that he takes
is ſuch, that he ſends an Elephant to the Captain that obtains
the Victory, and gives him three Months Wages beſides.
If any Souldier chance to die in this Exerciſe, his Widow
or his Heirs have two years Pay. But notwithſtanding all
their pain and labour, their Wages are ſo ſmall, that they
are not able to maintain their Wives and Children. But in
regard they Marry very young in this Country, the Wives
as well of the Souldiers as of all the meaner ſort of people,
take care to learn ſome Trade beſides, that they may be
able to maintain their Families. The Captains alſo have
their work prepar'd for them. For they are oblig'd to look
after the King's Elephants, and to manage them for the
Wars, and ſo to breed them, that they may not be afraid of
Wild-fire, or any other Artificial Fires: as alſo to build
places all along the Rivers, for the Galleys to ride ſhelter'd
in, when they can no longer live out at Sea. All theſe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and Captains, and Lords of the Court, which are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
call'd <hi>Mandarins,</hi> have but four days in a Month to
divert themſelves, two at the firſt change of the Moon, and
two at the full.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Manners and Customs of the People of
the Kingdom of Tunquin.</head>
               <p>THe People of <hi>Tunquin</hi> are naturally mild and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
ſubmitting eaſily to reaſon, and condemning
the Tranſports of Choler. They eſteem the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures
of ſtrange Countries far beyond thoſe of their
own; though they are not very curious of ſeeing any other
Countries but thoſe where they were born; and where, as
they ſay, they always deſire to live, to honour the Memory
of their Anceſtors. They have a tone in ſpeaking, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103159:25"/>
ſoft and pleaſing; happy memories, and in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
which is very florid, they uſe ſeveral appoſite Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons.
They have good Poets among them, and People
that love Learning; in which reſpect they are no way infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> their Neighbours.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Tunquineſes,</hi> as well Men as Women, are for the moſt
part well proportion'd, of an Olive Complexion, very
much admiring the whiteneſs of the <hi>Europeans.</hi> Their Noſes
and Faces are not ſo flat as thoſe of the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> as being
generally better made. Their Hair is very black, which
they uſually wear as long as it will grow, being very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in combing it. The Common People plait it in treſſes;
and tie it like a great Roll upon the top of their Heads.
But the Nobility, Men of Law, and Souldiers, tie their
Locks about their Necks, that they may not flutter in their
Faces. They do not believe their Teeth to be handſom, till
they have made them as black as jet; and they ſuffer their
Nails to grow; the longeſt being accounted the faireſt.</p>
               <p>Their Habit is grave and modeſt, being a long Robe that
reaches down to their heels, much like that of the <hi>Japonneſes,</hi>
without any diſtinction of Sex. This Habit is bound about
at the waſt with a Girdle of Silk, interwoven with Gold
and Silver, the Workmanſhip whereof is alike on both
ſides. As for the Souldiers, their upper Garments reach no
farther then their Knees; only their Breeches reach down to
the mid Leg, without either Hoſe or Shoes.</p>
               <p>The vulger ſort of People are altogether ſlaves for one
part of the year. For unleſs they be the Citizens of the
Capital City, where the King keeps his Court, all the other
Handicrafts of what Trade ſoever, as Joyners, Carpenters,
Lockſmiths, Maſons, and the like, are oblig'd every year to
work three Months at the King's Palace; and two Months;
or Moons more (For the <hi>Tunquineſes</hi> reckon their Months by
the Moon) for the <hi>Mandarins,</hi> or great Lords. The reſt of
the year is for themſelves, all which time they have liberty
to work for the ſupport of their own Family. This Service
in their Language is call<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d <hi>Viecquan,</hi> or the <hi>Condition of a
Slave.</hi> But they are liable to other drudgeries worſe then
thoſe before mention'd; as to lop Trees, with which they
chiefly feed their Elephants. This is a ſevere days work, to
which they were condemn'd by the great Grandfather of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103159:26"/>
the King that now reigns, after he had put an end to the
Civil Wars that turmoil'd his Kingdom, and that he had
brought his rebellious Subjects to ſubmit themſelves. They
had occaſion'd him a great deal of trouble, and in regard
he could not ſubdue them without a great hazard of his
Army, his Council advis'd him to famiſh them; but he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
choſe to give them their Lives, and to condemn them
and their Poſterity to this laborious Service, of which he
might in time reap the benefit.</p>
               <p>I have told you elſewhere that the <hi>Tunquineſes</hi> take great
delight to live upon the Rivers, which are there free from
Crocodiles and all other dangerous Animals, which haunt
the Waters of <hi>Nile</hi> and <hi>Ganges.</hi> Where we are to obſerve,
that theſe Rivers overflow their Banks every year, after the
Rains are fall'n, with that terrible violence, that many times
they carry away whole Towns and Villages, at what time
a good part of the Kingdom looks like a Sea, reſembling
the lower <hi>Egypt</hi> under Water upon the Inundation of <hi>Nile.</hi>

               <p>THE <hi>Tunquineſes</hi> cannot Marry without the conſent
of the Father and Mother, or if they be dead, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the allowance of their neareſt Kindred. They

diſappointed, to the great damage of the Public; the King,
who reign'd in the year 1639, being inform'd of theſe Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and their ill Conſequences, ſet forth a Law to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
thoſe Abuſes, and to curb the Authority of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.
He order'd that the young Man who was deſirous
to Marry, ſhould pay no more then ſuch a Sum, according

to the proportion of his Eſtate, amounting to one or two
fourths <hi>per Cent.</hi> and that they were not worth above a
hundred Crowns ſhould pay nothing. Now in regard the
Common People, both Men and Women, are naturally
laborious, all that the Maids can get they preſerve for their
Portions, and to buy them two or three handſom Garments,
with a Neck-lace of Coral or yellow Amber, and a certain
number of Beads, to garniſh their Locks; which they ſuffer
to hang down upon their Backs, accounting the beauty of
their Hair to conſiſt in the length.</p>
               <p>There is no Wedding kept without a great Feaſt; and
they muſt be very poor when the Feaſt laſts not above three
days; for ſometimes they junket for nine days together.
The next day after the Wedding the Bridgroom calls the
Bride his Siſter, and ſhe calls the Bridegroom Brother. The
Law of the Land permits the Man to divorce his wife when
he pleaſes, which they do many times for very ſlight cauſes.
But the Woman has not the ſame Priviledge: or at leaſt, if
ſhe deſire a ſeparation, it is much more difficult to obtain;
and the occaſion muſt be very notorious. The <hi>Tunquineſes</hi>
ſay that this Law was made to keep the Women in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
and to oblige them to be reſpectful to their Husbands.
When the Husband deſires this ſeparation, the Ceremony is
this. You muſt know that many of the Eaſtern People
never touch their Victuals with their hands, but make uſe
of two little ſticks about ſix inches long, gilt and varniſh'd,
which ſerve them inſtead of Forks. The Husband then,
when he goes about to repudiate his Wife, takes one of his
own ſticks, and one of his Wife's, and having broken them,
they take each one half, and ſow it up in a piece of Silk, in
which they keep it. Then the Man is bound to reſtore the
Woman what ſhe brought with her, and to keep the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
which they had between them. But theſe Divorces
are not half ſo frequent as formerly.</p>
               <p>The Laws are alſo very rigorous againſt Adultereſſes. So
that if a woman accus'd of this crime be convicted thereof,
ſhe is caſt to an Elephant bred up to this purpoſe, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
throws her up into the Air with his Trunk, and when
ſhe comes to the ground, tramples her under his feet, till he
can perceive no life in her.</p>
               <p>While my Brother was at the Court at <hi>Tunquin,</hi> he was a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103159:27"/>
witneſs of the ſevere Puniſhment, to which a Princeſs was
condemn'd, for being taken in the Act with a certain Prince.
It is the Cuſtom in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> when a Prince dies, to ſhut up
in the moſt private and retir'd part of all his Palace all the
women which he made uſe of in his life time. There they
are allow'd two Maids to attend them, they eat alone, and
ſee no perſon living any more to the very day of their deaths.
I cannot tell by what means one of the Princes of the blood
had got a view of one of the deceaſed King his Uncle's
wives; but being deſirous to ſee her again, and to overcome
all difficulties that oppos'd him, and to deceive the Guards
that watch'd the Dores, he made uſe of a ſlight not eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd.
For you muſt know, that in the Kingdom <hi>Tunquin,</hi>
as in all the Kingdoms of <hi>Aſia,</hi> in the Houſes of the Kings
and other great Lords, the Kitchin is uſually ſeparated from
the Houſe, and that the Garden is between them; ſo that for
the better carrying the Meat from one place to another, the
Servants make uſe of a kind of Flasket, or rather Iron
Cheſt. And to keep the Meat warm, the Diſhes are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by little ſticks laid athwart, about an inch diſtant
one from another, under which is an Iron Plate with holes
pierc'd quite through, about half a foot above another,
which makes the bottom of the Cheſt; between which
Plates they put lighted Coals, to keep the Meat warm.
Theſe Cheſts being to be carri'd by two men, the <hi>Tunquineſe</hi>
Prince plaid his game ſo well, that he was put into one of
theſe Cheſts wherein the Princeſſes Meat was wont to be
carri'd up into her Apartment. But he was not there many
days before the thing was diſcover'd. He was preſently
brought before the King, who caus'd him to have ſeveral
weighty Chains to be put about his Neck and Waſt, and
upon his Hands and Leggs; and thus chain'd and manacled,
he order'd him to be led about for five Months together,
to be ſeen by the People. After that he was ſhut up in a
cloſe Priſon, where he remain'd ſeven years, till the death
of the King, whoſe Son coming to the Throne, ſet him at
liberty, upon condition he ſhould ſerve as a private Souldier
upon the Frontiers of the Kingdom. As for the Princeſs
ſhe was ſhut up in a little Chamber upon the top of a
Tow'r, where ſhe remain'd twelve days without having
any thing given her to eat or drink; after that the Chamber
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103159:27"/>
was all uncover'd at the top, that the ſun might come at
her, and ſcorch her to death, and ſo ſhe di'd in three days.
The two Maids that ſerv'd her had a little more favour, for
they were thrown to the Elephants, who preſently trod
them to death. The two Porters of the Cheſt, or Flasket,
were ti'd to four ſmall Galleys, by the two Hands, and
two Leggs, and as they Row'd ſeveral ways were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
diſmembred. Being at <hi>Daca,</hi> in the Kingdom of
<hi>Bengala,</hi> I ſaw the ſame Juſtice done to a <hi>Bramerè,</hi> who
would have betraid <hi>Cha-Eſt-Can</hi> to the King of <hi>Arachan.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. VIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of the Viſits, Feasts, and Pastimes of the
Tunquineſes.</head>
               <p>AMong all the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> People the <hi>Tunquineſes</hi> are the
moſt ſociable, and moſt frequently viſit one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Generally they make their Viſits about Noon,
in the hotteſt time of the day, and then every one walks
with a Train ſuitable to his Condition. The Princes and
<hi>Mandarines</hi> ride upon their Elephants, or elſe they are carri'd
in a kind of Litter, where they may either ſit or lie. Six
Men carry it, and behind them follow ſix more to eaſe them
by times. Their Train conſiſts generally of fifty or ſixty
Perſons; neither are they permitted to exceed that number.
As for the ordinary Gentry, and Officers of the Court, they
ride a Horſe-back, not being allow'd above ſeven or eight
Servants to attend them. They chew, <hi>Betlè</hi> continually, as
all the other <hi>Aſiaticks</hi> do in ſuch places where it is to be had.
And when any one comes to viſit another, it would be
taken for a great affront, if at his taking leave, he ſhould
not be preſented with a Box of <hi>Betlè,</hi> to take what he
pleas'd.</p>
               <p>The richer that Box is, the more Honour is given to the
Perſon to whom the <hi>Betlè</hi> is preſented: Inſomuch that when
a Prince is about to be marri'd, he uſually ſends three of
theſe Boxes to his Spouſe, of which I have ſeen ſome at
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103159:28"/>
the Apartments of ſome of the Princes that came to the
Court of the <hi>Great Mogul,</hi> which were worth above 4 or
500000 <hi>Livres:</hi> One ſhall be cover'd with Diamonds, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with Rubies and Pearls, another with Emraulds and
Pearls, or elſe with other Jewels.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Tunquineſes</hi> take it for a great diſhonour to have their
Heads bare, which is only for Criminals, whom they cauſe
to be ſhav'd ſo ſoon as they are taken. So that it is a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
thing for a Criminal to eſcape the hands of Juſtice, for
wherever they go, when they find that a man has no Hair,
he is taken and carri'd to the Governour, who cauſes him to
be nail'd to a Croſs immediately.</p>
               <p>They ſit croſs legg'd, after the manner of the <hi>Aſiatic</hi>
People. At great mens Houſes, in the Halls, where they
receive their Viſits, there is as it were an <hi>Alcove,</hi> with a kind
of a Bedſted rais'd about a foot from the ground. It is
cover'd with a very fine Mat, made of little Reeds bound
together, as it were with fine thread. For it is not the
Cuſtom to ſpread Carpets upon the Floors, as in other
Countries of <hi>Aſia.</hi> Not that the deerneſs hinders them from
making uſe of them, for theſe Mats coſt them more then a
fine <hi>Perſian</hi> or <hi>Indian</hi> Carpet would do, but becauſe they are
cooler to ſit upon, and becauſe the <hi>Punies</hi> do not get ſo eaſily
into them. Being at <hi>Bantam</hi> I bought one of theſe Mats of
a <hi>Tunquineſe,</hi> which was admir'd for its fineneſs. It was nine
Ells ſquare, and as even and as ſoft as Velvet. With theſe
Mats they cover the Beds or Couches, upon which the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darins,</hi>
or <hi>Princes,</hi> and the Nobilty which accompany them,
ſeat themſelves round the Chamber, every one having one
Cuſhion under him, and another at his Back.</p>
               <p>As for their Diet the <hi>Tunquineſes</hi> are not very curious. The
Common People are contented with Rice boil'd in water,
and dri'd Fiſh, or ſalted Eggs. For as for Fleſh they eat
none but at their Feſtivals. The great Lords are ſerv'd every
day with Fleſh and Fiſh, but their Cooks know not what
belongs to bak'd Meats. Otherwiſe they are more neat in
their Kitchins and Chambers then we, only they make no
uſe either of Napkins or Table-cloaths. Whatever is ſet
before them to eat, is ſerv'd in little Plates, not ſo big as
our Trenchers, being made of wood lacker'd with all ſorts
of Flow'rs, like the Cabinets which are brought from <hi>Japan.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:103159:28"/>
                  <pb facs="tcp:103159:29"/>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:103159:29"/>
All theſe Plates are brought up, rang'd in order, in a large
Voyder, lacker'd like the Plates. Uſually the Voyder holds
ten or twelve Plates, and the Meat is cut in little pieces,
about the bigneſs of a Hazle Nut. They make uſe neither
of Spoons, nor Knives, nor Forks, but only of thoſe little
Sticks, of which I have made mention in the foregoing
Chapter, never touching their Meat with their fingers.</p>
               <p>When there are ſeveral ſitting at the Table, either at their
ordinary Meals, or upon ſome Feſtival, they account it a
great piece of Manners to be ſilent; or if they have a deſire
to Diſcourſe, they alway allow the Eldeſt the honour of
beginning, bearing a great reſpect to them that are aged.
But the Youngeſt, at the Table, is never permitted to begin
the Diſcourſe. They waſh their Hands, their Mouths, and
Faces before they ſit down, but never after Meals. And
when they deſire to know whether every one has had his
fill, they ask him whether he have eaten his Rice, according
to the Cuſtom of the Ancient Fathers in Scripture, who, by
Bread, meant the whole Repaſt. Neither is it a Cuſtom
among them to ask one another how they do? but how
many Meaſures of Rice he eat for his Dinner, and whether
he eat with an Appetite. This is a general Cuſtom among
all the Idolatrous <hi>Indians,</hi> unleſs in the Dominions of the
<hi>Great Mogul,</hi> where they eat not Rice only, but Bread, and
there they ask in civility how much Rice they boil'd, and
how much Meal they bak'd for Bread; for the more he eats,
the better in health they think a man is.</p>
               <p>Among all the Paſtimes of the <hi>Tunquineſes</hi> there are none
wherein they take ſo much delight as in Comedies, which
are only Acted in the Night-time; but thoſe which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
the day that they firſt behold the new Moon are the
beſt. They laſt from Sun-ſetting to Sun-riſing, and they
are ſet out with beautiful Decorations and Machines, very
pleaſing to behold. They are excellently well skill'd in
repreſenting the Sea and Rivers, and making a ſhew of Sea-fights,
and Combats between Galleys and Barks, though
they have ſeldom more then eight Actors, Men and Women.
The places appointed for theſe ſights, are great Halls, the
third part whereof the Theater takes up, the reſt being fill'd
with Benches for the Spectators. Upon each ſide of the
Theater is a Box very ſumptuouſly ſet out, reſerv'd for the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103159:30"/>
King when he pleaſes to come. The Actors and Actreſſes
are very magnificently clad. The dreſs for the Womens
heads being a kind of Miter or Diadem, which exceedingly
becomes them, from the hinder part whereof two Ribonds,
three fingers broad, hang down below their waſts. Both
the one and the other Act their parts very perfectly, and,
according to their manner, obſerve an exact time in their
Dancing.</p>
               <p>At one of the corners of the Hall ſit the two Judges of
the Comedy, one of whom beats time upon a Braſs Drum.
Their other ordinary Paſtimes, eſpecially for the Lords and
<hi>Mandarins,</hi> are Fiſhing and Hunting, though they take
more pleaſure in the former, by reaſon of the plenty of
Fiſh which their Rivers afford them. But, as I ſaid before,
they follow theſe ſports only upon the days that are permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them, as being better husbands of their time then we, not
ſparing any part of it from buſineſs. So that they who at the
beginning of that little knowledge which we had of theſe
People, wrote that their Manners and Cuſtoms were wild and
barbarous, were miſinform'd. For as there is no reaſon to doubt
of the truth of what I affirm, and what others have confirm'd
by other Relations, we may well conculde from what I have
ſaid, That all the Duties of Civil Society and Politeneſs are
not confin'd within our <hi>Europe;</hi> but that the Kingdom of <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin,</hi>
anciently a part of <hi>China,</hi> ſtill retains the good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Civility of the <hi>Chineſes</hi> themſelves.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of the Learned Men in the Kingdom of
Tunquin.</head>
               <p>CErtain it is, that the <hi>Tunquineſes</hi> have a very great
inclination for Learning, and that they apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to their Studies with diligence and ſucceſs:
for that they cannot be advanc'd without it to the Offices
and Dignities in the Kingdom. I do not here, by Learning,
mean the underſtanding of the Languages of our Learned
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103159:30"/>
Men of <hi>Europe,</hi> which are altogether unknown to the
Eaſtern People, and much leſs the Philoſophy of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>
of which they never ſo much as heard. But we mean the
knowledge of the Laws of their Country, by means
whereof they obtain the charges of Judicature; the <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,</hi>
and particularly <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> to which all the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entals
have a great inclination, as being great obſervers of
the Stars, by whoſe aſſiſtance they flatter themſelves to be
able to foretel things to come. The <hi>Tunquineſes</hi> are alſo paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
lovers of <hi>Muſic</hi> and <hi>Poetry,</hi> as being great admirers
of <hi>Comedy</hi> and <hi>Tragedy,</hi> of which thoſe two Sciences are
the main Compoſition; ſo that the Muſicians and Actors
of <hi>Tunquin</hi> are accounted the beſt in the whole Eaſtern
part of the World.</p>
               <p>That you may acquire Nobility by Learning, in your
Youth, you muſt paſs through three degrees, of the <hi>Synde,</hi>
the <hi>Doucan,</hi> and the <hi>Tanſi,</hi> from which degree you may
aſcend to that of the Nobility.</p>
               <p>To attain the firſt degree, it behoves the Youth of
<hi>Tunquin</hi> to apply themſelves for eight years together to their
Studies, and that very cloſe, to enable themſelves for the
Office of a Notary, Proctor, and Advocate, to which
there is nothing more conducing then to ſpeak Eloquently
in public. At the end of eight years, they are examin'd
concerning the duty of thoſe Employments; and if any
one fail to give an Anſwer to the Queſtions propounded, he
is ſent back again as incapable to obtain any Employment
for the future, or to ſtudy any longer. For thoſe that
acquit themſelves well of their Examination, which is
very rigorous, their Names are ſet down in a Regiſter,
and preſented to the King, who firſt grants them the liberty
to take upon them the Title of <hi>Synde,</hi> and then if it be
their aim to enjoy the Quality of <hi>Doucan,</hi> they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the <hi>Tanſi</hi>'s to ſtudy <hi>Muſic, Aſtrology,</hi> and <hi>Poeſie,</hi>
not only to be able to be judge of it, but alſo to perform
themſelves upon occaſion. For to be good judges of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,</hi>
which is a great Honour among them, it behoves
them to be both good Comedians and Muſicians. Nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is there any Paſtime more frequent then that of the
Theater in this Country; for there is never any ſolemn
Feſtival among them, which is not accompany'd and ſet
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:103159:31"/>
forth with Artificial Fire-works, in making whereof theſe
People are exquiſite; after which they have their Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
with Machines, and change of Scenes in every Act.
Beſides this, their Actors have a prodigious memory, ſo
that let the part be never ſo long, they never make uſe of
Prompters to aſſiſt them, as we do in <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They that will learn the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> muſt make their
own Inſtruments themſelves, and ſpend five years in this
ſtudy. They are examin'd every year, and if they fail
to anſwer ſuch Queſtions as are ask'd them, for the firſt
four they are pardon'd; but at the end of the five years,
if upon the grand Examination, they fail to anſwer the
Queſtions demanded them by the <hi>Tanſis,</hi> they are utterly
degraded; whereas if they ſatisfie their Examinors, they
are permitted the Name and Dignity of <hi>Doucan.</hi> After
thirteen years thus ſpent, before they can arrive to
the degree of a <hi>Tanſi,</hi> they muſt ſpend four years more in
learning to write and read the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Character to ſuch a
certain number of Words. For the life of a Man would
not ſuffice to learn to write and read the <hi>Chineſe</hi> quite
through. The reaſon is, becauſe that as to this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
it is not in <hi>China</hi> as in other Nations, where one Word
is compos'd of ſeveral Letters. The <hi>Chineſes</hi> for every
Word have a different Figure, all which Figures are very
numerous, as you may eaſily conjecture. By the by let
me tell you, that theſe Figures are made with ſmall Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
and that the <hi>Chineſes</hi> make uſe of a certain Ink, which is
made up into a Paſte, and ſo moiſten'd in Water as you make
uſe of it. They have alſo another ſort of Colour for certain
Words. But they cannot make uſe of Pens, as our <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans,</hi>
which are made of Quils; nor of thoſe of other
Eaſtern People, which are made of ſmall rediſh brown
Reeds, the beſt of which grow in certain Merſhes in
the Kingdom of <hi>Pegu</hi> and <hi>Arachan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to return to the Students of <hi>Tunquin,</hi> they are alſo
oblig'd to underſtand the Laws and Cuſtoms of the <hi>Chineſes,</hi>
as well as their own; and the laſt four years being at an
end, the laſt and great Examination is made in the great
place, within the Encloſure of the Palace of <hi>Tunquin,</hi> which
is a ſtately Marble ſtructure. There the King is preſent,
with the Princes and great Lords of the Court, the <hi>Mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:103159:31"/>
for Learning, and all the <hi>Tanſis;</hi> and many alſo
come on purpoſe from diſtant Provinces to the Solemnity.
Some Relations of <hi>Tunquin</hi> have been a little too ridiculous
in this particular, aſſerting extravagantly; that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
there are above 30 or 40000 Students preſent at
theſe Examinations; but by what I could learn from my
Brother, or gather by that diſcourſe which I have had
with the Natives, the number of Students never exceeds
three thouſand. There are in the place nine Scaffolds ſet
up; of which the one is for the King and Princes, the other
for the Examiners, and thoſe that are to be Examin'd: And
for the better hearing what is ſaid, the Scaffolds are built
like an Amphitheater. But whereas there are eight days
ſpent in this Examination, the King and the <hi>Mandarins</hi> are
never there but only the two firſt days. The laſt day all
the Names of them who have been Examin'd, as well they
who have anſwer'd well, as of them that have falter'd,
are left in the Hands of the ſixteen chief <hi>Manderins,</hi> who
are as it were ſixteen Counſellors of State, and then it is
at the King's pleaſure to favour whom he thinks fit, of
thoſe who have not given full ſatisfaction to the Queſtions
propounded to them. As for thoſe who were found very
ignorant, they are degraded with ſhame, and there is no
more ſaid of them. All thoſe Names are uſually written
upon large Tables, ſet up at the Gate of the King's Palace
for eight days together, to the end, that all the People may
know who are receiv'd into the Rank of <hi>Nobility,</hi> and
who not.</p>
               <p>The eight days being paſs'd, they are all to appear again
upon the ſame Scaffolds, where in the view of all the
World, they who have had the misfortune to have falter'd
in their Examinations, are diſmiſs'd as unworthy of any
Employment: while they who have behav'd themſelves
worthy of approbation, are honour'd with a Veſt of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
Satin, which they preſently put on, and then take upon
them the Name of <hi>Tanſi's.</hi> Then they have given them a
Liſt of the Towns and Villages, where they are to receive the
Rents which the King allows them; wherein however they
have not an equal ſhare; ſome being allow'd more, ſome leſs,
according to their merit, or the favour of the Prince.
Preſently they ſend notice to the places aſſign'd them of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103159:32"/>
time, at which they intend to be there: and then all the
Inhabitants come forth to meet them, in Honour of their
Dignity, with all ſorts of Muſic, and a Guilded <hi>Branquar,</hi>
carried by eight Men. There they are permitted to ſtay
three Months to divertize themſelves, and for their own
recreation. After that they return to Court, to inſtruct
themſelves in the affairs of the Kingdom, and the King's
Houſe, and to perfect themſelves in the knowledge of thoſe
things, which is the way to obtain the Dignity of a <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darin.</hi>
All Embaſſadours who are ſent to the Princes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning,
eſpecially to the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> are choſen out of theſe
<hi>Tanſi's,</hi> among whom they always make choice of the
ableſt, and not of the richeſt, the King allowing them
ſufficient to maintain their Port, and defray the expences
of the Embaſſy.</p>

Tunquineſes.</head>
               <p>THe Phyſicians belonging to the Kingdom of <hi>Tunquin</hi>
do not make it their buſineſs much to ſtudy Books;
ſpending their Youth in ſearching after the nature
and qualities of the Roots and Simples, and how to apply
them according to the nature of the Diſtemper. But more
particularly they apply themſelves to the beating of the
Pulſe, and its diverſity of Meaſure, by which they chiefly
pretend to underſtand the cauſe of the Diſeaſe, and what
Remedy to make uſe of for cure. And therefore when
they go to feel a Pulſe, they feel it in ſeveral parts of the
Body; and according to the diverſity of the part, and the
beating, they judge of the quality of the Diſtemper.
Therefore upon their firſt coming, they feel the Patient in
three places, firſt upon their right ſides, and ſecondly upon
their left. By the Pulſe which they feel upon the wriſt of
the right hand, they gueſs of the condition of the Lungs;
by that which they feel upon the Vein of the Arms, where
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103159:32"/>
generally People are let Blood, they gueſs at the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of the Stomach, and the Region of the Kidneys.
The Pulſe of the left Wriſt diſcovers to them the condition
of the Heart: By that in the Veins of the left Arm, where
uſually they let Blood, they are inform'd of the eſtate
of the Liver. By the Pulſes of the Temples, both right
and left, they give a more exquiſite judgment of the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys.
They are very careful to count how many times a
Pulſe of a ſick Perſon beats in the time of one Reſpiration;
and according to theſe ſeveral Pulſes, they tell you which
part of the Body is particularly diſtemper'd, whether the
Heart; the Liver, or the Lungs; or whether the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
proceed from any outward cauſe, as from Cold, Sadneſs,
or any other diſorderly Paſſion.</p>
               <p>They never make uſe of any other Remedies but of
Herbs and Roots, which they chooſe themſelves; there
being no diſtinction among them of <hi>Apothecary</hi> and <hi>Phyſician.</hi>
Theſe Herbs they mingle ſometimes with a little Ginger,
which they boyl in Water, and give the Decoction, being
ſtrain'd, to the Patient. They have very good Receipts
for the Purples, Epilepſie, and ſeveral other Diſeaſes
which are accounted incurable in <hi>Europe.</hi> They make uſe
of <hi>China</hi> Ink to ſtop a Dyſentery, and for the cure of Wounds.
When the Sea Ebbs from the ſhoar upon theſe Coaſts, they
find upon the Sand a little ſmall kind of Crabs, which dye
immediately, and by the heat of the Sun, which is there
extraordinary, become as hard as a Stone in a ſhort time;
theſe the <hi>Tunquineſe</hi> Phyſicians beat to Powder, and give
to their Patients in Dyſenteries, and Feavers, ſometimes in
<hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> ſometimes in plain Water. They mightily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the Herb <hi>Tea,</hi> which comes from <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Japan;</hi>
which latter Country produces the beſt. It is brought to
them in Tin Pots cloſe ſtop'd, to keep out the Air. When
they would uſe it, they boyl a quantity of Water, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the proportion they intend to uſe, and when the
Water ſeeths, throw a ſmall quantity into it, allowing as
much as they can nip between their Thumb and fore Finger
to a Glaſs. This they preſcribe to be drank as hot as they
can endure it, as being an excellent Remedy againſt the
Headach, for the Gravel, and for thoſe that are ſubject to
the Griping of the Guts; but then they order a little Ginger
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103159:33"/>
to be put into the Water when it boyls. At <hi>Goa, Batavia,</hi>
and in all the <hi>Indian</hi> Factories, there are none of the <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans</hi>
who do not ſpend above four or five Leaves a day; and
they are careful to preſerve the boyl'd Leaf for an Evening
Sallad, with Sugar, Vinegar, and Oyl. That is accounted
the beſt <hi>Tea</hi> which colours the Water greeneſt; but that
which makes the Water look Red, is little accounted of.
In <hi>Japan.</hi> The King and great Lords, who drink <hi>Tea,</hi> drink
only the Flower, which is much more wholſom, and of a
taſt much more pleaſing. But the Price is much different;
for one of our ordinary Beer Glaſſes is there worth a <hi>French</hi>
Crown.</p>
               <p>The moſt dangeroug Diſtempers that befall the <hi>Tunqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſes,</hi>
moſt uſually happen when the bad Air ſurprizes
the People; for of a ſudden it deprives them of their
Speech, and then Death ſuddenly follows without a ſpeedy
Remedy. The beſt Remedy for this ſudden Diſtemper is
to mix ſome Counterpoiſon with <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi> inſtead of Wine,
and to let the Patient drink it as hot as he can. The Patient
alſo, muſt at the ſame time be rub'd with a Cloth dip'd in
<hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> where Ginger has been boyl'd. This takes
away the pains caus'd by cold Winds, and unwholſom Airs.
Though ſome for the more ſpeedy cure of theſe pains, lay
the Patient upon a Bed made only of Girts, four Fingers
diſtant one from the other; and then ſetting a Chaſing-diſh
underneath, cauſe the ſick Perſon to ſweat in a Cloud of
Frankincenſe, till the pain is gone, repeating the ſame
thing Morning and Evening.</p>
               <p>As for Blood-letting, it is by no means us'd in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
They make uſe of Fire, eſpecially for the Purple-Feaver,
a Diſeaſe ſo dangerous in <hi>France.</hi> For the cure of
this, the Phyſitians of <hi>Tunquin</hi> take the Pith of a Reed,
which they dry very well; dip it in Oyl, and ſet it on Fire:
and then apply to every Purple Spot one of theſe lighted
Wicks. The Spot will give a whif like a ſmall Squib,
and that's an infallible ſign that the Venom is gone out of
the body. This Remedy is ſeldom apply'd but in the
night time, becauſe the Spot does not appear ſo well in
the day time. And the Phyſician muſt be very careful,
that when this Venom flies out of the Patient's Body, it does
not find a way into his own; for then there is no Remedy
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103159:33"/>
but Death. There are ſome Phyſicians that will prick the
Purple Spot with a Needle, and let out the Peſtilential
Blood; after which they burn the part ſo prick'd, and then
rub it with Ginger, not permitting their Patient to take
the Air in 20 days after they are cur'd. While they are
under cure, they drink nothing but Water, with Citron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peel
boyl'd in it, and abſtain from Fleſh and Butter. They
give them to eat Rice boyl'd in Water, and ſalt Fiſh; but
the more they abſtain from eating and drinking, the ſooner
they are cur'd. And indeed it is a wonderful thing to ſee
the excellent effects of their Remedies in ſo ſhort a time;
for they have no lingring Diſtempers to hold them years
together, as they do among us.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XI.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of the Original, Government, and Policy, of
the Kingdom of Tunquin.</head>
               <p>IT is not above ſix hundred years ſince <hi>Tunquin</hi> was firſt
govern'd by particular Kings, in regard it was anciently
a part of the Dominion of the <hi>Chineſes.</hi> What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
of the firſt <hi>Tunquineſes,</hi> That they were without
Governours, and without Kings, is altogether fabulous,
like to that which is related of a certain Infant of three
years of Age, who appearing before a great Aſſembly of
the People, exhorted them to free themſelves from the
power of the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> who were their Oppreſſors. Upon
which a lovely Horſe miraculouſly appearing to the ſaid
infant, he mounted the Horſe, and immediately ſetting for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
with thoſe that were gather'd after him, as alſo others
that appear'd as wonderfully to aſſiſt him, he ſet upon the
<hi>Chineſes,</hi> and defeated them in ſuch manner, that they never
durſt venture after that to return any more to reconquer
what they had loſt. But the moſt certain truth of <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin</hi>
Hiſtory aſſures us, That for theſe ſix Centuries laſt paſt,
it has been govern'd by ſix various Families. The firſt that
aſſum'd the Title of King was a famous Robber, whoſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103159:34"/>
Name was <hi>Din,</hi> who having gather'd together a great
Number of Malecontents, and Vagabonds, became ſo
powerful and formidable through his own Valour, that
after ſeveral bloody Battels gain'd, it was no difficult thing
for him to ſeize upon the Throne. But he did not reign
long in peace, for the moſt part of the People rebell'd
againſt him; and in the firſt Battel that he fought, he loſt
his Life. However his own Party won the day; and
having left two Sons, his eldeſt reigned three years; after
whoſe death, the younger Brother rul'd in his ſtead, but
dy'd ſoon after, neither of the Brothers leaving any iſſue
behind them. After that the Kingdom was miſerably
diſtracted by ſeveral Civil Wars, till the weaker Party
calling in the <hi>Chineſes</hi> to their Aſſiſtance, became the moſt
puiſſant. Then it was that a certain <hi>Mandarin,</hi> of the
Family of <hi>Lelequel,</hi> was advanc'd to the Throne, who
being a valiant and prudent Prince, reſtor'd tranquillity to
the whole Kingdom. Who, when he ſaw himſelf Eſtabliſh'd
in peace, built that large Palace, which they, who have
ſeen it, admire, as well for it's Circuit, as for its magnificent
Structure, being all of Marble of divers Colours, both
within and without. This King had but one Daughter,
who ſoon after her Father's death, the better to ſecure her
ſelf, marry'd one of the moſt powerful <hi>Mandarins</hi> in the
Country, of the Houſe of <hi>Tran.</hi> But ſoon after, one of
her Subjects rebelling againſt her, gave her battel, took
her Priſoner, and put her to death. Having thus got the
Power into his hands, the Rebel uſurp'd the Throne; but
nine years after, he was alſo ſlain in Battel by his own
Subjects, who had call'd the <hi>Chineſes</hi> to their Aſſiſtance.
They being thus Maſters of the Kingdom, held it for twenty
years, and ſet Governours over every Province. But at
length the <hi>Mandarins</hi> grew weary of their Oppreſſion, becauſe
of the heavy Tributes which they laid upon the <hi>Tunquineſes;</hi>
ſo that a valiant Captain of the Houſe of <hi>Le,</hi> having aſſembled
a numerous Power together, gave the <hi>Chineſes</hi> three Battels,
and in every one overcame them. The <hi>Chineſes</hi> thus expell'd
out of <hi>Tunquin,</hi> the Conquerour ſeiz'd the Crown, and in
his Family the Regal Government continu'd for above four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
years. After which time, a great Lord, of the
Family of <hi>Marr,</hi> which had formerly enjoy'd the Scepter,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103159:34"/>
to Revenge himſelf of an affront which the King had
put upon him at Court, found a way to eſcape his hands,
and being aſſiſted by a great Number of diſcontented Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
of which the beſt regulated Kingdoms are always
full, and the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> who always ſought an opportunity
to regain what they had loſt, after a bloody Battel, he
poſſeſs'd himſelf of the Kingdom, it being never known
what became of his Predeceſſor. But this new King en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd
the Fruits of his Victory but a ſmall while. For two
years afterwards, a <hi>Mandarin,</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Trin,</hi>
having eſpous'd the Daughter of another great Lord, openly
declar'd War againſt his Soveraign, with a deſign utterly to
extirpate the Houſe of <hi>Marr.</hi> Unhappily for him, death put
a ſtop to his deſigns, though he left two Sons behind him,
able enough to have purſu'd his undertakings. But the
eldeſt, naturally timorous, and fearing to engage himſelf
in a dangerous War, voluntarily ſubmitted himſelf to the
King, who gave him the Government of a Province, and
marry'd him to one of his Siſter's Daughters. The younger
Brother being a valiant Prince, and having his deceaſed
Father's Army at his Devotion, though the King propos'd
him great advantages, would give ear to nothing, but out of
his ambition to Reign himſelf continu'd and ſucceſsfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd
what his Father had begun. In the ſecond
Battel which he gave the King, who was there in perſon,
he took him Priſoner, together with his Brother, who had
ſubmitted to him, and ſome few days after he put them both
publicly to death at the head of his Army; the one as an
unjuſt uſurper of the Throne; the ether as a deſertor, who
had abandon'd his Father's Army, and ſo ill follow'd his
intentions.</p>
               <p>Now though as Victor he might eaſily have aſcended the
Throne, and tak'n upon him the Name and Title of King,
yet he would not accept of any higher Title then that of
General of the Army; and the better to Eſtabliſh himſelf
in his Authority, and to gain the affection of the People,
he caus'd Proclamation to be made through all the Provinces
of the Kingdom, that if there were any Prince of the Houſe
of <hi>Le</hi> yet remaining alive, he ſhould ſhew himſelf, with
full aſſurance that upon his appearing, he ſhould be put into
poſſeſſion of the Kingdom. There was but one to be found,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103159:35"/>
who had been ſo cloſely purſu'd by the Houſe or <hi>Marr,</hi>
while it rul'd, that to ſave his Life he was forc'd to abſcond
himſelf in the Frontiers of the Kingdom, under the Habit
of a private Soldier. The General was overjoy'd to find
that there was yet a lawful Heir of the Houſe of <hi>Le</hi> to be
found, that he might place him upon the Throne. So that
ſo ſoon as he was known to be of the Legitimate Race, all
the Equipage and Attendance of a King was ſent to him,
with Order to all the Provinces as he paſs'd along, to receive
him as if he were already crown'd. The whole Army
march'd two days march to meet the King, and brought
him to <hi>Checo,</hi> the capital City of the Kingdom, where he
was plac'd in the Throne of his Father, and with great
Pomp proclaim'd King of <hi>Tunquin.</hi> But General <hi>Trin,</hi> who
car'd not ſo much for the Royal Title, as the Royal Power,
ſo order'd his buſineſs, that leaving to <hi>Le</hi> all the outward
ſhew and Pomp of Royal Authority, he reſerv'd to himſelf
the whole command of the Army, and the greateſt part of
the Revenues of the Kingdom abſolutely to diſpoſe of at
his own pleaſure. So that from that time to this hour, we
may affirm that there has been, and ſtill are, two Kings of
<hi>Tunquin,</hi> of which the firſt has only the Name and Title of
King, and is call'd <hi>Boüa,</hi> and the ſecond <hi>Choüa,</hi> who has
all the Authority, diſpoſing of all things at his pleaſure,
while the other remains ſhut up in his Palace like a Slave,
not permitted to ſtir abroad but upon certain days: and
then he is carry'd through the Streets of <hi>Checo,</hi> like an Image,
though with a magnificent Train and Royal Equipage. He
has generally 2000 Soldiers for his Guard; and ſometimes
20000 which are quarter'd upon the Frontiers, chiefly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>Cochinchina.</hi> He alſo has ready upon the Frontiers 50
Elephants for War. And upon the Rivers of the Kingdom
where the Enemy can come to damage him, he uſually
keeps 100 great Galleys, with a vaſt company of ſmall
Galliots, to which the Soldiers and Rowers that belong,
have more pay then the others at Land. And theſe, that
they may row with more ſtrength, row ſtanding, with
their Faces toward the Prow, quite contrary to our Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
who turn their backs.</p>
               <p>The King gives public Audience almoſt every day; but
he makes no Edict, or public Decree, that is of any effect,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103159:35"/>
if it be not alſo Sign'd by the <hi>Choüa.</hi> At theſe Audiences
he has with him thirty two Councellors of State, and beſides
theſe, a hundred others to judge of all Appeals of the
Kingdom. The Eunuchs have a very great Power at Court,
as in all other Courts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the King, as to his moſt
important affairs, confides more in them then in his own
Children. The eldeſt Children do not always ſucceed
their Father; for the <hi>Choüa,</hi> or General, with all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors,
which are generally his Creatures, thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
that when the King ſhould have more Sons then
one, he ſhould make choice of whom he pleas'd to ſucceed
him. So that ſo ſoon as he has nam'd him, the <hi>Choüa,</hi>
attended by the principal Officers of the Army, Councellors
of State, and Eunuchs, come to congratulate him, and
to give him their Oaths to ſet him upon the Throne after
the death of his Father; and for the other Brothers they
are always ſhut up in the Palace, as in a Priſon, without
medling with any affairs of State. They never ſtir out of
the Palace but four times a year, and they never ſtay
abroad above ſix days at a time, the Officers that attend them
being put upon them by the <hi>Choüa,</hi> who is as it were Lord
high Conſtable of the Kingdom. The firſt of theſe ſix
days of liberty they go to viſit the Temples, and the Prieſts,
to whom they give large Alms; the two next days they
take their pleaſure in hunting; and the three laſt days they
ſpend their time upon the Rivers, in Galleys ſumptuouſly
trimm'd and adorn'd.</p>
               <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Tunquin</hi> is divided into eight large Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
every one of which has its Governour, and its Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
from whoſe ſentence there lies an Appeal to the
Court. We ſhould wrong this Country to ſay that there
were no Nobility therein; as indeed there are none in moſt
Kingdoms of <hi>Aſia.</hi> But they muſt all attain to this degree
their merit; ſome by the Warrs, and ſome by their Learning.
They who attain their Nobility by Arms, have wherewithall
to live handſomly at home; and they begin to learn their
Exerciſes betimes, at fartheſt by eleven or twelve years of
Age. The firſt thing they are to underſtand, is how to
handle their Swords; the Blades of which are ſtreight,
long, and broad, like thoſe of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> having but
one Edge. They are alſo taught to aim with their Bows,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103159:36"/>
and to fire a Musket with Matches, (for they know not
the uſe of Fire-Locks) to ride the great Horſe, to ſhoot
running, and to manage their <hi>Zagay's,</hi> which are a ſort
of Staves, cheek'd with Iron, like a Half-Pike. When
they are ready in all theſe Exerciſes, then they learn to
make all ſorts of Artificial Fire-works; as alſo how to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
new ones, to make uſe of them againſt the Elephants. By
the way I muſt needs tell you, there are ſome of theſe Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants
as I have ſeen ſeveral times, that are ſo accuſtom'd
to theſe Artificial Fires, that they regard them not at all,
neither are any way diſturb'd at the Squibs that are thrown,
and go off under their very Noſes and Bellies. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
of 200 of theſe Creatures which the Eaſtern Kings
carry to their Wars at a time, you ſhall have hardly fifteen
that are ſo hardy and valiant. So that unleſs their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
take not great care, inſtead of running upon the
Enemy, they turn upon their Friends, and put the whole
Army into a moſt diſmal confuſion; as you ſhall hear by
the following Story. For <hi>Aurenge-Zebe,</hi> the preſent
<hi>Great Mogul,</hi> being then a young Prince, obtain'd of
<hi>Cha-gehan,</hi> his Father, to let him have the command of
an Army of threeſcore thouſand Men, and fourſcore Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants;
and with this force, out of his Antipathy to the
Chriſtians, he laid Siege to <hi>Daman,</hi> a Town belonging to
the <hi>Portugals,</hi> fourteen Leagues from <hi>Surat.</hi> The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
was a perſon of great Valour, and had alſo two Sons
with him, who, together with himſelf, had both ſerv'd
the King of <hi>France.</hi> He had alſo in the Town eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Gentlemen, who voluntarily put themſelves into the
Garriſon for its defence, from all parts of <hi>India</hi> where the
<hi>Portugueſes</hi> had to do, and were all excellently well mounted.
For the <hi>Portugals</hi> at that time made uſe of none but <hi>Arabian</hi>
Horſes, the worſt of which coſt a thouſand Crowns at leaſt.
The Governour finding that the <hi>Indian</hi> Prince began to preſs
hard upon him, having already made two Aſſaults, reſolv'd
with all his Cavalry and Infantry to make a Salley upon <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
Morning, cauſing them to fix at the ends of their Spears
and Lances certain Artificial Fire-works, to which they were
order'd ſuddenly to give fire, as ſoon as they ſhould gain
the Elephants Quarter. This deſign was ſo ſucceſsful, that
when it came to be executed, the Elephants were ſo ſuddenly
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103159:36"/>
terrifi'd, that running impetuouſly through the <hi>Indian</hi> Army,
they trod to the ground, and cut in pieces with the Swords
and Scithes which were faſten'd to their Trunks, what ever
ſtood in their way. The <hi>Portugals</hi> taking advantage of this
confuſion, made no leſs havock among the amazed Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
whom they had ſurpriz'd ſecurely and profoundly
aſleep. For they had an opinion, that the <hi>Portugals</hi> would
never attack them upon the Sabboth day, believing they
had the ſame veneration for that day which the <hi>Jews</hi> had.
But they were utterly deceiv'd, in ſo much that the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals,</hi>
by virtue of this Stratagem ſo cloſely purſu'd, obtain'd
a notable Victory, to the utter deſtruction of 20000 of
<hi>Aurenge-Zebe</hi>'s Army, the ſpoils whereof are reported to
have amounted to above twelve Millions.</p>
               <p>But to return to the Kingdom of <hi>Tunquin,</hi> I muſt tell you,
that the <hi>Tunquineſes</hi> have often wag'd War againſt the <hi>Chineſes,</hi>
becauſe the firſt would not pay the latter the Tribute which
was accorded them by a Treaty made by one of their Kings,
of the Houſe of <hi>Le.</hi> But in the year 1667, the <hi>Chineſes,</hi>
ſeeing that the <hi>Tartars</hi> had made themſelves Maſters of their
Country, made a Peace with the <hi>Tunquineſes,</hi> wherein it
was agreed, that the ſaid Tribute ſhould be no longer paid;
but that they ſhould every year ſend an Embaſſador only to
<hi>Pequin,</hi> to do homage to the Emperour of <hi>China.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for their Juſtice and Policy, they obſerve a very exact
Order and Regulation over all the Kingdom of <hi>Tunquin,</hi> as
well in their Cities, as in the Country. So that few of the
beſt regulated Kingdoms exceed them. More eſpecially
they have a great care, for the public good, to repair the
Bridges and High-ways; and every quarter of a League
there is ſuch Proviſion made, that any Traveller may there
meet not only with Water, but Fire alſo to light his Pipe,
being generally great ſmoakers of Tobacco.</p>
               <p>As for Murder, they are very exact in puniſhing that
crime. For they carry the Perſon apprehended before
the Judge; and then he muſt hold to his Mouth a little wiſp
of Graſs, to ſhew, that by his diſorderly life he had made
himſelf a Beaſt. Not much unlike this is the cuſtom in
<hi>Perſia,</hi> where the King and his Council condemn or pardon
all but ſuch as have murder'd a Man that has any Kindred.
For then all the favour that the King can ſhew him is, to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103159:37"/>
deliver him into the hands of the next of kin to the Perſon
kill'd, who has power to agree with the Criminal for a Sum
of Money, which is rarely done, as being accounted an
Act both infamous and ignominious. So that if there be
no agreement made, then it behoves the next of kin to be
the Executioner himſelf, and put the Criminal to that death
to which he is before condemn'd.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="12" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XII.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of the Court of the Kings of Tunquin.</head>
               <p>ALthough the King, as I have already ſaid, have
not much Authority in his Kingdom, which is
govern'd altogether by the General, who has the
whole <hi>Militia</hi> at his Devotion, yet he is highly honour'd by
his Subjects, and he keeps a very ſplendid Court. The
firſt and fifteenth day of every Month, all the <hi>Mandarins</hi>
who are the Grandees of the Kingdom, are bound to come
in their <hi>Chineſe</hi> Habits to kiſs the King's hands. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable,
or General, was formerly wont to perform the
ſame Office, but by degrees he has obtain'd a diſpenſation,
and only ſends another Prince in his ſtead. As for all the
other <hi>Mandarins,</hi> Governours of Provinces, Juſticiaries,
and Military Officers, every year they go to kiſs the <hi>Choüa</hi>'s
hands, and to congratulate him upon the firſt day of the
year, which is the fifteenth of the fifth Month; as alſo when
he has obtain'd any great Victory over his Enemies. So
that the General has more Honour done him then the King
himſelf. 'Tis alſo the cuſtom of the <hi>Tunquineſes,</hi> among
the Men, that when they meet any Perſon higher in condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
then themſelves, they make four profound obeyſances
to the very Earth. But for the Women, what ever their
condition be among themſelves, they never make but one.
They who are deſirous to be admitted into the Palace to ſee
the King, are oblig'd to put on Violet Robes, and their
Servants muſt be clad in the ſame colour. They that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
the King's preſence to obtain any favour, muſt
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103159:37"/>
carry a Preſent along with him. For though the Conſtable
be the perſon that diſpoſes of all Offices and Commands
over all the Court and Kingdom, yet every year upon the
fifteenth day of the ſeventh Month, the King diſtributes
ſeveral conſiderable Gifts and Largeſſes to his Courtiers; as
alſo to the Children of ſuch Fathers who have perform'd
any important Service for the good of his Kingdom. He
gives them Pains of Gold, every one worth ſix hundred
<hi>Livres;</hi> and Bars of Silver, amounting each to forty ſix
<hi>Livres.</hi> The ſame day he alſo releaſes all Priſoners, both
Criminal and Debtors, provided the crime do not deſerve
death; and that the debt do not exceed two Bars of Silver.
Alſo every year, the three laſt days of the laſt Month, the
40 <hi>Mandarins,</hi> who are the chief Councellors of State, take
the Oaths of all the Lords and Officers of the Court, and of
their Wives; cauſing them to ſwear to be faithful to the
King, and if they know of any thing that concerns the
King's perſon, or his Kingdom, to diſcover it. All Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of Provinces give the ſame Oaths to the Lords and
Gentlemen under their Juriſdictions; and the Governours
of Cities to the Citizens, and other Inhabitants. They
that diſcover any Treaſon never fail of any reward; only
with this diſtinction, in reference to the quality of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that reveal it. For as for the <hi>Mandarins</hi> and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
the King rewards them according to his own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:
But as for the meaner ſort, whether Men or Women,
they are ennobl'd, and gratifi'd with a reward of 50 Pains
of Gold, and 500 Bars of Silver, which in all amounts to
53000 <hi>Livres.</hi> But they eſteem their Nobility far beyond
their Money.</p>
               <p>At certain times of the year, there is a Muſter of the
Youth of the ſeveral Provinces; and all thoſe who are
found not to be either of the Nobility, or not to have learnt
any Trade, are preſently enroll'd for the Service of the
King, who every five years make choice of ſuch as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
for his Guard, and ſends them to the Frontier Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
There are ſome who endeavour to get off by Money;
but if they be diſcover'd, both the Officers and the Soldier
are puniſh'd without redemption. For they hang a little
Bell about his Neck, Fetter his Arms, and in that poſture
ſend him to the Conſtable, who preſently orders his Head
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103159:38"/>
to be ſtruck off. But in regard the <hi>Tunquineſes</hi> are very averſe
from ſeeing any Blood ſhed, the Kindred or Friends of the
condemn'd Perſon, intercede that he may be hang'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
that death to be moſt honourable which is not defil'd

               <head type="sub">Of the Ceremonies obſerv'd when the Kings of
Tunquin are advanc'd to the Throne.</head>
               <p>BEfore we ſpeak of the Enthroning the Kings of
<hi>Tunquin,</hi> and of the Ceremonies that attend it, it
behoves us to relate the manner of their ſetting out
of the Palace, when they go at any time to take their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
The King is ſeated upon a moſt magnificent <hi>Palan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin,</hi>
carry'd by eight Men, where he may be beheld by
all the People; the Lords and Officers of the Court attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him on foot, provided he do not go out of the City:
for when he goes into the Country he rides upon an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,
and the Lords follow him on Horſe-back. When
the Queen Mother, or his firſt Wife go abroad, they are
likewiſe carry'd upon a cloſe <hi>Palanquin,</hi> with Lattice-Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
to the end, they may ſee and not be ſeen; and
behind the <hi>Palanquin</hi> follow the Maids of Honour on foot.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mandarins,</hi> and great Princes, ſolemnize their Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days
every year, with great Feaſting, Paſtimes, Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and Fire-works, and all their Friends and Kindred
fail not to attend them to honour the Solemnities. In the
year 1645, the eldeſt Son of the King, who was by his
Father appointed for his Succeſſor, upon one of his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days
ſhew'd the Court all the divertizements he could
imagin, and the King who had a great affection for him,
ſent him a thouſand Pains of Gold, and five hundred Bars
of Silver, to the value of 120000 <hi>Livres.</hi> At which
time, large Alms are diſtributed, eſpecially to poor Widows
and Priſoners.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:103159:38"/>
When the King dies, and leaves ſeveral Sons, they ſet up
him whom (when alive) he choſe for his Succeſſor. The
third day after the Deceaſe of the King, the Conſtable with
all the Military <hi>Mandarins,</hi> the Lords of the Council, and
all the Governours of Provinces, repair to the Prince's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment,
where they preſent him with a <hi>Chineſe</hi> Habit, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which having mounted him upon an Elephant, they
bring him into one of the great Courts of his Palace, which
is all covered with Cloth of Gold and Silver as with a Tent.
There it is, that being placed upon a Throne magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
enrich'd, all the <hi>Mandarins</hi> proſtrate themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Earth with their Heads downward; in which po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
having lain for ſome time, they riſe, and cloſing their
Hands together, with their Arms and Eyes lifted up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
they ſwear to the new King to be faithful to him till
death. This firſt Ceremony being over, the new King, to
ſhew himſelf liberal upon his firſt coming to the Crown,
cauſes four Panes of Gold, and ſix Bars of Silver, to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to every one. But to diſtinguiſh the Conſtable from
the reſt, he gives him twenty Panes of Gold, and forty Bars
of Silver: and to the Preſident of the Council or Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
ten of Gold and twenty of Silver. Theſe Preſents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus made, ſeveral Pieces of Artillery are fired round
the Palace, accompanied with ſeveral Volleys of ſmall
Shot, there being then in Arms above 30000 Horſe and
Foot; and then the King is ſet upon a magnificent <hi>Palan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin,</hi>
and the Conſtable and chief of the Council ride before
upon lovely Horſes. Sixteen of the principal Officers of the
Court carry the King, <hi>viz.</hi> eight Military <hi>Mandarins,</hi> and
eight of the Council. And in this manner they ſet forward
to the Apartment of the deceaſed King, from whence all
the Lords retire for two hours, except the Eunuchs; and
then it is, that the Princeſſes, Ladies of the Court, and chief
Wives of the <hi>Mandarins,</hi> come to kiſs the King's Hand, and
congratulate his Advancement to the Throne. Which
done, all the Lords return again to a noble Feaſt after the
manner of the Countrey ready prepar'd. Their Viands are
not ſo delicate, nor ſo deliciouſly dreſs'd as ours, neither
have they ſo much variety. 'Tis true, they have thoſe
<hi>Birds-nests,</hi> already mention'd, which they mix in the moſt
part of their Diſhes, which gives the Meat a taſt of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103159:39"/>
almoſt all ſorts of Spices. Of all the Meats which they eat
Colts Fleſh is in moſt eſteem, and Dogs Fleſh, neither of
which agree with our Palates. The Feſtival is concluded
with Comedies and Fireworks, which la allſt the night.
The next day the 30000 Men that gave their Volleys of
ſmall Shot the day before, are drawn up in good order in a
Field next, and all the principal Officers of War, Colonels,
Captains, and Lieutenants, leave the Frontiers to be at the
ſame place. Then the King mounted upon his <hi>Palanquin,</hi>
and carried by ſixteen of his principal Officers, the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and grand Squire riding before, and attended by ſeveral
other Commanders on foot, with ſeveral Mummers that
play and dance before the <hi>Pallanquin,</hi> goes forth of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
the Drums, Trumpets, Cornets, and other Warlike In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,
filling the Air with their Martial Sounds. In
this Pomp, and with this Equipage, the King being come
to the Camp, quits his <hi>Palanquin,</hi> and mounts one of his
great Elephants of War, which are us'd to the noiſe of the
Guns and ſight of the Fireworks. Being thus mounted, he
rides into the middle of all his Troops, in which place all
the Officers ſwear Fidelity to him; after which he beſtows
his Gifts upon them, to every Colonel two Panes of Gold,
and forty Bars of Silver; to every Captain the half of what
he gives a Colonel, and to every Lieutenant the half of what
he gives a Captain: and as for the Souldiers, they have
every one a Moneths Pay. Theſe Preſents being made, the
whole Army diſcharges three Volleys, and then every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
retreats into a large Hutt, where they have Meat and
Drink prepar'd for them, enough to ſerve them a whole
day and a night. In the ſame Field is alſo ſet up a fair woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Palace, ſumptuouſly enriched within with Paintings
and ſeveral pieces of Workmanſhip in Gold. There the
King ſpends all the night, ſome part in Feaſting, ſome part
in Plays and ſeeing the Mummers dance, and the reſt in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
the Fireworks. The next day the King leaves his
wooden Palace, which is afterwards fir'd by the Souldiers,
as well as their own Hutts, and ſo returns to the City. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
arrived at his Palace with the ſame pomp that he went
forth, he ſeats himſelf upon his Throne, and there ſhews his
Liberality to thoſe that made the Fireworks, to the Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
and Dancers, and all the reſt that were any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributory
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103159:39"/>
to the ſetting forth the Pomp of the Ceremony.
Then he gives Acceſs to all the People, and two Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners,
one for the Merchants, and the other for the Handi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts,
make a Speech to the King, the ſubſtance whereof is;
that all the Burgeſſes and Inhabitants of the good City of
<hi>Checo</hi> do acknowledge him for their King, and that they will
be faithful to him till death. The Speech being ended, the
King preſents the Body of the Merchants with 50 Panes of
Gold, and 300 Bars of Silver; and the Body of the Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
with 20 Panes of Gold, and 100 Bars of Silver. The
People gone home, every one ſtrives who ſhall ſpend moſt
in Feaſting and Comedies, adding of their own to the Kings
Bounty; ſo that every Quarter of the City is full of Jollity
and Rejoycing for a week together. Some days after come
the Commiſſioners for the Commonalty, from all parts of
the Kingdom, who in the behalf of their Cities and Towns
make known to His Majeſty the univerſal Joy of the People
for their lawful Prince, aſſuring him of their Fidelity, and of
their Service againſt the <hi>Chineſes.</hi> They name particularly
the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Tunquineſes</hi> have no greater Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
then they, and for that the Hatred between them is ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable.
The King obſerving the good will of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
teſtifies his Acknowledgment in this manner: All
that have not time out of mind been Rebels to their lawful
Sovereigns, but have conſtantly taken up Arms for their
Defence, are diſcharged for a year from all Taxes and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions;
and for the reſt, who have at any time formerly
aſſiſted the Enemy, they are onely exempted for ſix moneths.
All Priſoners for Debt partake alſo of the King's Bounty, ſo
that after the Preſident of the Council has made a Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
with the Creditors for half the Summe, the King pays
the reſt.</p>
               <p>It is a thing almoſt incredible, what a vaſt number of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
the King ſends to the Temples of his falſe Gods, to
be there offer'd to the Idols.</p>
               <p>The number of Beaſts is ſaid to exceed an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,
beſides the value of a million in Panes of Gold, Tiſſues,
and Silks, to adorn the Idols, and Orange-coloured Calicuts
for the <hi>Bonzes,</hi> and thoſe that attend the Service of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gods.</hi>
Among the reſt of theſe Preſents he ſends a vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Pieces of blue Calicuts for the poor people that are
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103159:40"/>
kept in the <hi>Pagods,</hi> as our Poor are kept in Hoſpitals. The
Idolatrous Princes alſo conſume incredible Summes to adorn
the <hi>Pagods</hi> and Images of their falſe Gods. There are ſome
of them three foot high, all of maſſy Gold; others of Silver
bigger than the Life.</p>
               <p>The new King after all theſe Ceremonies are over, takes
his time to go and give thanks to his falſe Deities for his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the Crown when the Moon firſt changes, ſhutting
himſelf up for the firſt week with the <hi>Bonzes,</hi> and living in
common with them with a great deal of Frugality.</p>
               <p>During this time he viſits the principal Hoſpitals, to ſee
how the poor people are us'd, eſpecially the old Folks,
whom they have in great Veneration, to whom he diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
new Alms; for naturally the <hi>Tunquineſes</hi> are very
charitable. To conclude, he makes choice of ſome fair
Situation, where he orders the building of a new <hi>Pagod,</hi>
which he devotes to ſome of his Idols. Thus his Devotion
being ended, upon the firſt day of the ſecond Quarter, he
mounts one of his Elephants of War, attended by all the
Officers of his Court on Horſe-back, and ten or twelve
thouſand men on foot, choſen out of the whole Army to
attend him. All the ſecond Quarter the whole Court ſays
in a certain Plain, where are three Houſes ſet up, one for
the King, one for the Conſtable, and one for the Preſident
of the Council; with a world of Huts for the reſt. There
are alſo ſeveral ſmall Cabins ſet up, which are not covered
and cloſed but upon one ſide, which they turn as the Wind
blows; and theſe are the places where they dreſs their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals:
For at that time the King allows two meals a
day to all his Attendants.</p>
               <p>Through this Plain runs the River of—which
is very broad in that place. Upon this River are ſeveral
Galleys richly gilded and painted, but eſpecially the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral,
which exceeds all the reſt in Maginificence. The
Prow, the Poop, the Ropes, the Oars, but onely that part
which goes into the water, glitter all with Gold; the Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
very ingeniouſly painte the Rowers well clad. For
there the Rowers are all Souldiers and Freemen, contrary
to the Cuſtom in <hi>Europe.</hi> The Souldiers in their youth are
taught to handle their Oars, and have ſomewhat better Pay
than the Land-Souldiers. The Galleys are not ſo big as
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:103159:40"/>
ours, but they are longer, and cut the water better. While
the King ſtays in this place, he diverts himſelf with ſeeing
theſe Galleys row one againſt another. In the Evening the
Rowers come aſhoar with their Captains to kiſs the King's
Hand, and they that have behav'd themſelves moſt ſtoutly
and nimbly, carry off the Marks of his Bounty. The ſeven
days being paſt, the King calls before him all the Souldiers
of the Galleys with their Officers, and gives them two
moneths Wages extraordinary, as he does to his Land-Souldiers.
'Tis a wonderful thing to behold the vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Fireworks which they throw about, as well upon the
Land as upon the Water. For my Brother, who has been
preſent at all theſe Shews, has told me, that for theſe ſeven
days together you would think the Air and Water all on fire.
Being at <hi>Bantam</hi> I once ſaw one of theſe artificial Firework-Shews
which the <hi>Tunquineſes</hi> that were there plaid off before
the King, and I muſt confeſs it was quite another thing from
what we make in <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſeven days being paſt, the King returns to the City in
the ſame order, and with the ſame pomp, as he went
forth; and being come to his Palace, he goes directly to
the Apartment of his Princeſſes, where none but his Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs
accompany him, where he ſtays all the reſt of the
moneth. Every Evening he diverts himſelf with new Fire-works,
which are plaid off before the Womens Lodgings;
where alſo the Eunuchs, together with the Comedians and
Mummers, contribute to divertiſe the Ladies.</p>

of their manner of Burying their Dead.</head>
               <p>WHen the King of <hi>Tunquin</hi> dies, he is preſently
Embalm'd and laid in a Bed of State, where
for ſixty five days the People have liberty to
come and ſee him. All that time he is ſerv'd as he was
when he was alive; and when the Meat is taken from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Body, one half is given to the <hi>Bonzes,</hi> and the other
half to the Poor. So ſoon as the King hath breath'd his
laſt gaſp, the Conſtable gives notice thereof to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of Provinces, and orders them how long they ſhall
Mourn.</p>
               <p>All the Military <hi>Mandarins</hi> and Judges wear Mourning
generally three years, the King's Houſhold nine moneths,
the Nobility ſix, and the meaner ſort three moneths. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
theſe three years there is a Ceſſation from all Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements,
except thoſe that attend the Ceremony of the
King's Advance or Elevation to the Throne. All the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands
which are ſerv'd up to the King are verniſh'd with
Black. The King cuts his Hair, and covers his Head with
a Bonnet of Straw, as do likewiſe all the Princes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors
of State; neither do they leave off that Habit till the
King's Body be in the Galley which is to carry him to his
Enterment. Three Bells which hang in one of the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Palace, never leave tolling from the King's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring
till the Corps be put into the Galley. The third day
after his Deceaſe all the <hi>Mandarins</hi> repair to Court, to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
their ſorrow which they have for the Death of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed
King, and ten days after that the People are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to ſee the Body lie in State, till it be put into the
Galley.</p>
               <p>During the ſixty five days that the Body is thus expos'd,
the Conſtable is buſie in preparing for the Funeral Pomp.
From the Palace to the place where the Galleys wait for
the Body, it is about two days Journey, and all the way</p>

Pomp at the Interment of the
Kings of Tunquin.</head>
                           <p>1. Two Meſſengers of the Chamber proclaim the deceaſed King's
Name; each of them bears a Mace, the Head whereof is full of
combuſtible ſtuff for Artificial Fire or Fuſées.</p>
                           <p>2. Next proceed Twelve Elephants; on each of the four fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
is one bearing the King's Standard. Then follow four other
Elephants, with Wooden Turrets on their Backs, and in every one of
theſe are Six Men, ſome being armed with Muſquets, others with
Fire Lances. The four laſt Elephants do ſeverally carry a kind of
Cage; ſome of which are on all ſides ſhut up with Glaſs Windows,
the other with a ſort of Grates; the firſt being of a Square, the other
having ſix ſides and facing.</p>
                           <p>3. Then rides the Maſter of the Horſe, attended with two Pages
on Horſe-back.</p>
                           <p>4. Twelve Horſes are led by the Bridle two and two, by as
many Captains of the Guard. The Harneſs of the firſt Six Horſes
is very rich, the Bit, and all the Furniture of the Bridle and Saddle
are of pure Gold, the Saddles are embroydered likewiſe with Gold:
But the Six other Horſes Harneſs is all cover'd over with Gold
Plates.</p>
                           <p>5. The Chariot which bears the <hi>Mauſolee,</hi> wherein is the
King's Corps, is dragged by Eight Stags trained to this Service.
Each of theſe Stags is led by a Captain of the Life Guard.</p>
                           <p>6. Then follows the new King afoot clad in White Satten, with
a Straw Cap on his Head. If he hath any Brothers, they attend
on him in the like Attire; and they are ſurrounded with Muſicians
and Players on the <hi>Hoboys,</hi> and other Inſtruments.</p>
                           <p>7. There proceeds afterwards Six Princeſſes in White Satten,
who carry Meat and Drink for the deceaſed King. Theſe are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb facs="tcp:103159:42"/>
by two Ladies of Honour in Purple Garments; and about
theſe Ladies are ſeveral Muſicians.</p>
                           <p>8. Eight Princes of the Royal Bloud go in Purple Garments
with Straw Hats.</p>
                           <p>9. Four Governours of the four chief Provinces of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
each bearing a Stick on his Shoulder, on which hangs a Bag full
of Gold and ſeveral Perfumes; and theſe Bags contain the Preſents
which the ſeveral Provinces make unto the deceaſed King, for to be
buried with his Corps, that he may make uſe of the ſame in the other
World.</p>
                           <p>10. Two Chariots go next, each drawn by Eight Horſes, and
every Couple being led by Two Men. In each Chariot is a Coffer or
Trunk full of Bars of Gold and other Riches, for the deceaſed King's
uſe in the Life to come.</p>
                           <p>11. A great Crowd of the King's Officers, and of the Nobility,
do follow this Funeral Pomp, ſome afoot and ſome on horſe-back, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Offices and Qualities.</p>

the Funeral Pomp of the Kings of Tunquin,

                           <p>The King's Body is put into a Galley, which is drawn up the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
This River is increaſed by ſeveral Brooks that come down
from the Mountains, and it runs through barren and Deſart Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.
In ſome of theſe places they are wont to bury the Corps very
privately; for ſix onely of the chief Eunuchs of the Court are to know
where the King hath been buried. An Oath is tendered to them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to reveal the place. And this is done perhaps on ſome Religious
Motive, and likewiſe through Fear, that the Treaſures which are
buried by him ſhould be digged up. Theſe Riches are ordinarily ſome
Maſſy Bars of Gold and Silver, as likewiſe ſome Pieces of Cloth of
Gold and Silver, and ſuch kinds of other rich Furnitures, which he is
to make uſe of (as they ſay) when he hath need of them in the other
World. Many Lords and Ladies of the Court will needs be buried
Alive with him, for to ſerve him in the places where he is to go. I
have obſerved in paſſing through the Eſtates of the <hi>Raja</hi> or Prince of
<hi>Velouche,</hi> which border on the Eaſterly parts of the Kingdom of
<hi>Viſapour,</hi> that the Wives ſuffer themſelves to be buried Alive near

ſpread with Violet-colour'd Calicut, which is the King's
Colour. But in regard the King and all the Court march
afoot both going and coming, they make it ſeventeen days
Journey. At every quarter of a Leagues end are ſet up
Huts, where is ready prepar'd Water to drink, and Fire to
light their Tobacco. After the Pomp is over, and that the
King is returned home, the Cloth is taken up and given to
the <hi>Bonzes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the order of their March it is thus:</p>
               <p>The two men that go formoſt of all, are the two Uſhers
of the Door of the King's Chamber, who go repeating
aloud the Name of the deceaſed King, carrying each of
them a Mace of Arms, the bole whereof is full of artificial
Fireworks. The twelve that follow, are the twelve chief
Officers of the Galley, which draw the Tomb whereon the
King's Name is written. Then follows the grand Squire on
Horſeback, attended by two others. Next appear twelve
led Horſes, which are led two by two, ſix of which have
their Bridles enrich'd with thin Plates of Gold, and their
Saddles embroydered. The other ſix with Bridles of Gold,
and Houſſes embroidered, and fring'd about with a Gold and
Silver Fringe; every Horſe being led by two men. Next
to them follow twelve Elephants, four which carry each of
them a man carrying a Standard; four others which carry
each of them a Tower with ſix men apiece, ſome with Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets,
others with Fire Lances; the four laſt carry each of
them a kind of a Cage, of which one is made with Glaſs
Windows before and upon each ſide; the other like a kind
of a Lattice, and the other with four kinds of Ruffs: and
theſe are the King's Elephants which he rode upon when he
went to the Wars. Behind them follow eight Horſes, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of them led by a Captain of the Guard, who draw
the Herſe. The new King, and his Brothers if he have
any, or the Princes of the Bloud, follow the Herſe, clad in
Robes of White Satten, which is their Mourning Colour.
Laſtly follow two Chariots, each one drawn by eight Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and carrying two Coffers, wherein are the Panes of
Gold, Bars of Silver, rich Tiſſues and Habits, which are to
be buried with the Body of the deceaſed King.</p>

                  <head>The Funerals of the Tunquineſes.</head>
                  <p>AS fer the ordinary Funerals of the <hi>Tunquineſes,</hi> they are
more or leſs pompous, according to the Quality of
the Perſons.</p>
                  <p>At their Enterments they uſe great ſtore of artificial Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works,
which are the Companions as well of their Sorrow
as their Joy. They ſet upon the Tomb of the deceaſed
good ſtore of Victuals and Comfitures, out of a belief that
the dead are the better for them. For their Prieſts keep
them in that blind Error for their own advantage, and ſo
well order their buſineſs, that there is nothing left by morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
The ſame thing is practiſed by the <hi>Chineſes</hi> at <hi>Bata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi>
where they have a place without the Town to bury
their dead, which puts me in mind of this Story: Every
evening the Guard is relieved as well in the City as in the
Fortreſs. At the ſame time alſo they put forth eight Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and a Corporal at each Gate of the City, who go the
Rounds about the Walls of the City, and as far as within Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-ſhot
of the Walls, being fearful of being ſurpriſed by
the King of <hi>Mataran,</hi> or <hi>Bontam,</hi> their Capital Enemies.
Now becauſe the <hi>Chineſes</hi> burying place lay in the Walk of
theſe Souldiers, when they ſaw the Provant upon one of the
Tombs, took it away to their Guard, and there feaſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
The <hi>Chineſe</hi> Prieſts, that uſually came about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
to take away the Victuals, finding themſelves ſeveral
times bereaved of their Expectations, and ſuſpecting the
Souldiers belonging to the <hi>Holland</hi> Garriſon, firſt complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the General and Council; but that not taking effect,
they reſolved to poiſon both the Meat and the Drink, to
prevent the like Fraud for the future. This took ſo good
effect, that afterwards many of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Souldiers being
poiſoned, deterr'd the reſt from any more ſuch Licoriſh At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Religion and Superstition of the
Tunquineſes</head>
               <p>THe <hi>Tunquineſes</hi> as to matters of Religion are divided
into three Sects: The firſt takes its original from
an ancient Philoſopher called <hi>Confutius,</hi> whoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
is very famous over all <hi>China,</hi> and the neighbouring
Countries. Their Doctrine aſſerts that Man is compos'd
of two parts, the one fine and ſubtil, the other material and
groſs; and that when Man dies, the ſubtiler part goes into
the Air, and the groſſer part ſtays in the Earth. This Sect
maintains the uſe of Sacrifices, and adores the ſeven Planets.
But among all their Gods and Idols they have four in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
veneration; the Names of theſe Gods are <hi>Rauma, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolo,
Ramonu,</hi> and <hi>Brama.</hi> They have a Goddeſs alſo, whoſe
Name is <hi>Satisbana,</hi> which is ſhe whom the Women adore;
but for the King and the <hi>Mandarins,</hi> eſpecially the more ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
ſort, they adore the Heavens. The ſecond Sect had
for its Founder a certain Hermite called <hi>Chacabout,</hi> and is
followed by the moſt part of the meaner people. He has
taught them the Tranſmigration of Souls, and has enjoyn'd
his Followers to obſerve 10 Commandments.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, That they ſhall not kill. 2. That they ſhall
not ſteal. 3. That they ſhall not defile their Bodies-
4. That they ſhall not lye. 5. That they ſhall not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful
in their words. 6. That they ſhall reſtrain their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
Deſires. 7. That they ſhall do injury to no man.
8. That they ſhall not be great Talkers. 9. That they ſhall
not give way to their Anger. 10. That they ſhall labour
to their utmoſt to get Knowledge.</p>
               <p>As for them that deſign to live a Religious Life, they muſt
renounce the Delights of this Life, be charitable to the poor,
overcome their Paſſions, and give themſelves up to Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He taught moreover, that after this Life there were
ten diſtinct places of Joy and Torment: and that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners
of this Law ſhould feel Torments proportionable
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:103159:47"/>
to their Offences, without any end of their Torments. That
they that endeavour'd to fulfill his Law, and had fail'd in
any point, they ſhould wander in divers Bodies for 3000
years before they entered into happineſs. But that they
who had perfectly obeyed his Law, ſhould be rewarded
without ſuffering any change of Body. And that he himſelf
had been born ten times, before he enjoyed the Bliſs which
he poſſeſſed, not having in his firſt Youth been illuminated
with that Knowledge which he afterwards attained. This
<hi>Chacabout</hi> was one of the greateſt Impoſtors that ever was in
<hi>Aſia,</hi> having ſpread his Opinions over all the Kingdom of
<hi>Siam,</hi> over a great part of the Provinces of <hi>Japon,</hi> and from
thence into <hi>Tunquin,</hi> where he died.</p>
               <p>The third Sect is that of <hi>Lanthu,</hi> to whoſe Fables the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponneſes</hi>
and <hi>Chineſes</hi> give great credence, but the <hi>Tunquineſes</hi>
more. He was a <hi>Chineſe</hi> by Nation, and one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Magicians in the Eaſt. He made a great many Diſciples,
who to authorize this black Impoſtor, and the more to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
upon the people, made them believe that the Birth of
<hi>Lanthu</hi> was miraculous, and that his Mother carried him in
her Womb, without loſing her Virginity, ſeventy years.
He taught much of <hi>Chacabout</hi>'s Doctrine; but that which
won the Hearts of the people was, that he ſtill exhorted the
Grandees to build Hoſpitals in all Cities where there had
been none before. Inſomuch that ſeveral of the Nobility
betook themſelves to thoſe places to look after the Sick, as
did alſo a great number of the <hi>Bonzes</hi> for the ſame reaſon.
While my Brother was there, the <hi>Choüa,</hi> a great Enemy to
theſe Vagabonds, ſent for a great number of <hi>Bonzes</hi> and
<hi>Says,</hi> or idle Fellows, and picking out the ſtrongeſt and
beſt proportion'd, ſent them away to the Frontiers for Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
               <p>'Tis the Cuſtom of the <hi>Tunquineſes</hi> to adore three things
in their Houſes: The firſt is the Hearth of their Chimney
made of three Stones The ſecond is an Idol which they
call <hi>Tienſa,</hi> which is the Patroneſs of Handicrafts, as Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Painting, Goldſmith's work, &amp;c. So that when they
put forth a Child to learn any of thoſe Trades, before they
let him work they ſet up an Altar, and ſacrifice to this Idol,
to the end he may infuſe into the Lad wit and aptneſs to
learn. The third is the Idol <hi>Buabin,</hi> which they implore
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103159:47"/>
when they deſign to build an Houſe. For then they erect
an Altar, and ſend for the <hi>Bonzes</hi> and <hi>Says</hi> to ſacrifice to
this Idol. To this purpoſe they make great preparation of
all ſorts of Viands, and then preſent him with ſeveral gilt
Papers, wherein are written ſeveral Magic words, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
by that means that he may not ſuffer any misfortune
to befall the Houſe they are going to build.</p>
               <p>There are ſome <hi>Tunquineſes</hi> that adore the Heaven, others
the Moon, and others the Stars. There are alſo ſome that
adore five parts of the Earth, making a fifth part in the
middle of that which is known to us, and to them alſo, but
confuſedly. When they worſhip them, they have for each
of the parts a particular Colour. When they adore the
Northern part, they clothe themſelves in black; and the
Diſhes and Table whereon they lay their Sacrifices are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
black. When they worſhip the South their Habit is
red; when the Eaſt, green; when the Weſt, white; and
when they adore the middle of the World, they wear
Yellow.</p>
               <p>They offer Offerings likewiſe to Trees, Elephants, Horſes,
Cows, and almoſt to all other ſorts of Animals. They that ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Characters are accuſtomed every fifth moneth
of the year, to ſacrifice for the Souls of the dead who were
never buried. They believe that by ſo doing their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings
ſhall be more enlightned for the apprehending of
all things.</p>
               <p>Every year, at the beginning of the year, they have a
great Solemnity, to honour after their death thoſe who in
their life-time have done any noble action, and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
for their Valour, reckoning in that number thoſe
that have been ſo hardy as to rebel againſt their Princes, as
being men of Courage. Three days before this great So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity,
which is perform'd in a large Field, they ſet up
ſeveral Altars, ſome for the Sacrifices, others for the Names
of the Illuſtrious Men whom they deſign to honour. The Eve
before above 40000 Souldiers ſpend the night in this Plain,
where all the Princes and <hi>Mandarins</hi> are ordered to meet
with their Elephants and led Horſes, and the King himſelf
goes thither in perſon. After they have finiſhed all their
Sacrifices, and burnt good ſtore of Incenſe to the Honour of
the dead, the King and all the <hi>Mandarins</hi> make three pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:103159:48"/>
Reverences where the Altars are; then the King
ſhoots with his Bow and Arrows five times againſt the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
where lie the Names of thoſe that were ſo raſh as to
rebel againſt their Sovereigns. After that the great Guns
go off, and the Souldiers give three Volleys of ſmall Shot,
to put all the Souls to flight. Then they burn all the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
and a great number of gilt Papers, which were made
uſe of at the Sacrifices; concluding all with a moſt hideous
ſhout of all the Souldiery. Which done, the <hi>Bonzes, Says,</hi>
and ſuch like people, come and devour the Meat that was
made uſe of for the Sacrifices.</p>
               <p>The firſt and fifteenth days of the Moneth 'tis a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
thing to hear the Chiming Din of their great Bells. For
thoſe are the more eſpecial Holydays ſet apart for the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of their Gods, and all the <hi>Bonzes</hi> and <hi>Says</hi> give them
more than ordinary Worſhip upon thoſe days, redoubling
their Prayers, and repeating upon thoſe days every one of
them a ſtrange kind of Charm ſix times over. At theſe
times ſeveral people bring Meat and Drink to the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres
of their Kindred, to ſacrifice for the good of their Souls
to eat. The <hi>Bonzes</hi> fail not to be there, and when the
others have paid their Devoirs the <hi>Bonzes</hi> fall to, and what
they cannot eat they give to the poor. But for all the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere
Lives of theſe <hi>Bonzes</hi> and <hi>Says,</hi> neither the King nor
the <hi>Mandarins</hi> make any account of them, ſo that they are in
credit onely with the common people.</p>
               <p>In the Kingdom of <hi>Tunquin,</hi> where the great Cities have
ſeveral <hi>Pagods,</hi> there is hardly a Town or Village that has
not one, and for every <hi>Pagod</hi> at leaſt two <hi>Bonzes</hi> and two
<hi>Says.</hi> But there are ſome <hi>Pagods</hi> that maintain forty <hi>Bonzes</hi>
and as many <hi>Says,</hi> who live in common under a Superiour,
they keep to the Doctrine of <hi>Chacabout,</hi> and a Goat is the Idol
which they adore. They wear about their Necks a kind of
Necklace, conſiſting of 100 Beads, very big and made of
Wood. In their Hands they carry a Staff, which is headed
with a Bird of varniſh'd Wood. They beg for their living,
and are not like the <hi>Bonzes</hi> in other Kingdoms, who beg
Alms as it were their due; theſe on the contrary uſe all the
modeſty and humility that may be, never taking more than
is needful for them: and if they have any thing to ſpare,
they give it to the poor Widows or Orphans that cannot get

their living. Their Orders permit them to marry, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
they leave their Monaſtery. They aſſiſt at the Funerals
of great men, where they ſay a kind of Orizon, ſounding
their Trumpets and Cornets, while the Bells in their <hi>Pagods</hi>
go at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Tunquineſes</hi> alſo have a great veneration for two
Magicians, and one Magicianeſs. The firſt of their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
whom they call <hi>Tay-bou,</hi> makes them believe that he
knows the Events of things to come; ſo that when they
have any occaſion to marry their Children, build a Houſe,
buy Land, or undertake any buſineſs of Conſequence, they
conſult this Oracle to know what ſhall happen to them.
The Magician courteouſly receives them, and with a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
modeſty demands of them (for Example) the Age of
the perſon concerned. Then taking into his hands a great
Book about three fingers thick, wherein are the Figures of
Men, half Men, and ſeveral ſorts of Land and Water Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
of Circles, Triangles, and Squares, he goes to work,
and at the ſame time puts into a Goblet three Pieces of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
whereon are engraven ſeveral Characters onely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one ſide. After he has ſhaken the Pieces in the Cup,
he throws them upon the ground as at Croſs and Pile; if
all the Characters lie undermoſt he looks no further in his
Book, but looks upon it as an unfortunate ſign; but if one
or two Characters come up, he looks in his Book, and
makes the perſon believe what he pleaſes. But if all the
Characters happen to turn uppermoſt, then the Magician
cries out, that the Party is the moſt fortunate in the world.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Magician is called <hi>Thay-Phou-Thouy,</hi> to whom
they have recourſe in all their Sickneſſes. When any ſick
perſon comes to him, he takes a Book full of Figures like
the former; onely the Form of the Book is different, for
this is not above an inch thick, and about four fingers long,
with eight Panes full of Cyphers. If after ſeveral Apiſh
tricks which he acts before the ſick perſon to amuſe him, he
affirms that the Diſtemper comes from the Devil, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
together with the ſick party and they that brought him,
do Homage to the evil ſpirit: this Homage conſiſts of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Sacrifices, and the Friends of the ſick party preſent to
the Devil, or rather to the Magician, a Table furniſh'd with
Rice and other Viands. But if after all theſe Offerings the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103159:51"/>
ſick party do not recover his health, all the Friends and
Kindred of the ſick party, with as many Souldiers as they
can get, ſurround the ſick perſons Houſe, and ſhoot off their
Muſquets three times, to drive away the Devil. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the Magician makes the ſick party and his Friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that the God of the Waters is the cauſe of the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
eſpecially if the ſick perſon belongs to the Water, as
being a Mariner, Boatman, or Fiſherman. And to the end
he may be cur'd, and that the appeas'd God may return to
his watry Habitation, he orders that all the way from the
ſick parties Houſe to the next River may be ſpread with all
the Pieces of Stuff which all the Kindred have, and that
they ſet up Huts at ſuch and ſuch diſtances, and keep in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one a ſeveral Table furniſh'd with all ſorts of Viands for 3
days. And all this to oblige the Deity to retire, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
him till he gets home. But the better to know the
riſe of the Diſeaſe, <hi>Thay-Phou-Thouy</hi> makes them believe,
that they muſt go and conſult <hi>Thay-Bou,</hi> who is the chief
Magician, and if he anſwer that the Souls of the dead have
cauſed the Diſtemper, the Magician imploys all his tricks
and devices to draw to him thoſe miſchievous Souls; and
when he has got into his Clutches, as he pretends, the Soul
that is the Author of the Diſeaſe, he ſhuts him up in a Bottle
full of Water till the party be cured; and then breaking the
Bottle he ſets the Soul at liberty to go about his buſineſs.
When the party recovers, he makes him and his Friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that if the Bottle had not been well ſtopp'd to keep in
the Soul, their Kinſman would have died infallibly.</p>
               <p>The Magicianeſs, which the <hi>Tunquineſes</hi> alſo conſult, is
called <hi>Bacoti,</hi> and ſhe keeps a great Correſpondence with
the Devil, to whom, if ſhe has a Daughter, ſhe offers her as
ſoon as ſhe is born, the more to oblige him. If any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bewail the death of her Child, and be deſirous to know
in what condition the Soul of the Child is in, in the other
world, ſhe goes to <hi>Bacoti,</hi> who to ſatisfie the Mother pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
falls a beating her Drum, to ſummon the Soul to come
to her, who preſently appears, as ſhe pretends, and tells her
its Condition whether good or bad. But moſt commonly
ſhe makes the ſilly Mothers believe that the Soul is happy,
and bids them be of good cheer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:103159:51"/>
The Superſtitions of theſe people are very numerous, but
the moſt remarkable are theſe:</p>
               <p>The ſtudious ſort of people are very diligent to learn, how
by looking in a Mirrour to foretell things to come.</p>
               <p>There are ſome that preſent <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi> to the dead, and
ſprinkle their Aſhes with it; but this onely upon the Aſhes
of their Anceſtors, from whom at the ſame time they beg
for Health; Honour, and Riches.</p>
               <p>Others there are, that upon the firſt day of their year take
a piece of Chalk, and make ſeveral Figures round, ſquare,
and triangular, upon the Threſhold and Steps of their
Doors. They ſay thoſe Figures fright away the evil ſpirits.
Some there are that make great Obſervations upon the Feet
of their Hens, and draw ſtrange Concluſions of bad or ill
fortune from thence. Others travelling into the Countrey,
if they ſneeze but once by the way, return to the place from
whence they parted in the morning, ſaying, That had they
gone on, ſome miſchief would have certainly befallen them:

any danger for that day.</p>
               <p>There are ſome ſo ſuperſtitious, that going out of their
Houſes, if they meet a Woman, they return home again for
two or three hours; but if they meet a Man, 'tis a good
<hi>Omen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt Fruit which they gather at the beginning of the
year, is that which the <hi>Araguer</hi> bears, ſpoken of in the third
Chapter. And this is the firſt which they eat with great
Ceremony, during the firſt Quarter of their ſecond Moneth.
To which purpoſe they are ſo poſſeſs'd with the Devil, that
they poyſon one of theſe Fruits, and give it to a Child to eat,
believing that by taking away the life of the poor innocent
Child, they ſhall thrive the better all the year after.</p>
               <p>When the Moon is eclipſed, they ſay there is a certain
Dragon that aſſails her, and endeavours with all his might
to overcome her, with an intention to devour her. Then
to aſſiſt the Moon, and to put the Dragon to flight, they
diſcharge their Muſquets, ring their Bells, beat up their
Drums, and make a hideous noiſe till the Eclipſe be over:
and then they believe that they have reſcued the Moon, for
which they make as great a rejoycing, as if they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
ſome eminent Victory over their Enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:103159:52"/>
They are alſo very ſuperſtitious in reference to the hours
of the day. They divide the natural day into twelve hours,
and to every one they give the name of ſome Beaſt, as of a
Tiger, a Lion, a Bear, a Horſe, a Dragon, an Ape, &amp;c. The
Moneths alſo and Days have their particular Names: and
when a Child is born, preſently the Father and Kindred go
to ſee the name of the Beaſt by which the Hour was call'd
wherein the Child was born; believing that Animal will
prove fatal to it. At the time that my Brother was at the
Court at <hi>Tunquin,</hi> the King then reigning being born in the
hour of the Horſe, would never give Audience, nor ever ſtir
out of his Palace at that hour, for fear ſome miſchief ſhould
befall him at that time. That Prince was ſo ſuperſtitious,
that one of his Children dying in the fifth moneth, which
bears the name of the Horſe, he would never permit him to
be enterr'd, but caus'd him to be burnt, and ſcatter'd his aſhes
in the Air.</p>
               <p>This is that which I could gather of moſt remarkable and
moſt conſiderable matters concerning the State of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Tunquin,</hi> either out of the Manuſcripts which my
Brother (who died in the <hi>Indies</hi>) left me, or from the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Iſland of <hi>Formoſa</hi> is about Eighty
Leagues in compaſs; ſo that the <hi>Holland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
were never in poſſeſſion of the whole
Iſland, but were onely Maſters of four
Fortreſſes, and two and fifty Villages,
wherein they could number about four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
or fifteen thouſand Inhabitants. As
for that part which is under the <hi>Indians,</hi> the beſt diſcovery
that we can give, is onely ſuch as was made by a young
<hi>Hollander</hi> upon this occaſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:103159:53"/>
There was in the chief Fort belonging to the <hi>Hollanders</hi> a
young man, imployed there as an under-Factor, who being
wild and extravagant, was put out of his place and made a
Souldier. He not able to undergo that miſerable courſe of
life, reſolved with himſelf rather to die, than live in that
mean condition. Thereupon having at ſeveral opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
made a ſhift to make up a little Pack of what he thought
was moſt fit for the Mountainiers of the Iſland, he watch'd
his time and ſtole out of the Fort, and took his way directly
toward the Mountains. With theſe Highlanders he liv'd
four years, in which time having learnt the Trade and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the Countrey, he ventur'd to return to the <hi>Holland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
again, who received him kindly, as being willing to
underſtand the Government of the People, and by what
means they might traffick with them. Whereupon the young
man made them this Relation.</p>
               <p>As for the Government of the People he ſaid, that over
every ſix Villages there was an Overſeer with four Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
who adminiſter Juſtice, and puniſh the ſmalleſt Theft
with Death. The Men are crucified; the Women are laid
along upon a thick Beam of Wood, and then with a Scimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
their Bodies are divided into three parts. The Men are
ſo puniſh'd for Theft or Murder, and the Women for Theft
or Adultery. If it be a Pety Larceny, not above the value
of a Shilling, they give them an hundred Laſhes with a
Whip, and burn them in the Cheek. They that believe
themſelves to be unjuſtly dealt with, whether in Civil or
Criminal Cauſes, enter their Appeal to go to the North Eaſt
part of the Iſland, in which diviſion of the Iſland there ſtands
a City by the Sea-ſide, where he that commands all the
Highlanders reſides. At the end of our Moneth of <hi>March</hi>
ſeveral of theſe Highlanders reſort to this City, eſpecially
the Merchants, who carry along with them all their whole
Stock that they had hoarded together the year before in
Horns of Oxen, Harts, Bufulo's, and Raw Hides; and then
return again at the end of <hi>April,</hi> bringing back in return of
their Commodities <hi>Japon</hi> and <hi>China</hi> Stuffs, Clothes, and
Linen of the ſame Countrey, and Gold and Silver <hi>Japoneſe</hi>
Money, of various Coyns and Value. He told them alſo,
that he believed that in the Mountains near the Sea, there
are certain Mines of Gold and Silver, or ſome River where
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:103159:53"/>
they find it in Powder, and that the <hi>Japoneſes</hi> fetch it in their
Veſſels. He did all he could to diſcover the truth, but after
he had travelled two or three days Journey, the People
would let him go no further. For at the end of every three
or four hours travel there are Guards ſet, who examine all
Travellers whither they go; neither will they let their own
Countrymen paſs, but ſuch as go about their Law or to trade.
Moreover he told them, that if they would give him Goods
to trade withall, as Amber, Coral, Looking Glaſſes; but
chiefly ſome Skins of the Sea Fiſh, which is rougher than
Seal-skin, he would endeavour to get to the very City it ſelf
where the Ships ride. Theſe Skins are greatly eſteemed by
the Natives to adorn the Scabbards of their
Cutlaſſes and Swords. For uſually upon the
back of this Fiſh you ſhall find nine little
Stones, which make a kind of a Roſe, eight
in a Circle and one in the middle, as you
ſee theſe nine diſpoſed in their exact order.
When the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> traded onely to <hi>Japon,</hi>
                  <figure/>
it is incredible how dear they ſold theſe Skins. For if Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
had well ſet theſe Stones at an equal diſtance, and even
in bigneſs, one of theſe Skins would yield above ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<hi>Piaſters,</hi> and more. This Fiſh is caught in the <hi>Perſian</hi>
Gulph, where I have ſeen of them, but I ſaw but very few
ſo perfect as that which I have deſcrib'd, which would in
thoſe Countries yield ten thouſand Crowns.</p>
               <p>But to return to the Story; the Governour gave the
young man what he deſired, and ſent him going: but the
<hi>Chineſes</hi> ſoon after expelling the <hi>Hollanders</hi> out of the Iſland,
it was never known what became of the young man.</p>
               <p>It may be wondered why <hi>Formoſa</hi> was taken ſo ſoon:
but here were two Reaſons, firſt the faint-heartedneſs of the
Governour, and ſecondly his breach of word to a <hi>French</hi>
Souldier of <hi>Rouen,</hi> call'd <hi>Abraham du Puys;</hi> for he having
ſerved out his time of ſeven years, deſir'd leave to be gone,
but the Governour, after he had promis'd him fair at firſt, at
length abſolutely refuſed him. Soon after the <hi>Chineſes</hi> came
to beſiege the place. The Souldier thus diſappointed, and
ſeeing himſelf coop'd up who might have been free, had the
Governour ſo pleaſed, ſtudied a fatal revenge upon all his
Countrymen; for being by this means grown deſperate,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103159:54"/>
watch'd his opportunity, and flinging himſelf from the Fort
into the Sea, ſwam directly to the Enemy. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
offered 200 Pieces of Eight to any perſon that would
venture after him, and bring him back dead or alive. A
Serjeant accepted his offer, but it was to get looſe as the
other had done; and ſo they got both ſafe into the Enemies
Quarters. The <hi>Chineſes</hi> preſently carried them to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Coxima;</hi> and he being a perſon of Valour and Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
made very much of them, whereupon they readily
and willingly inform'd him of the ſtrength and condition of
the Fortreſs. They alſo adviſed him to remove his Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
to the weakeſt part of the Town, whereas he was then
aſſailing it where it was moſt ſtrongly fortified: which if
he would do, they aſſur'd him he ſhould be ſoon Maſter of
the Fort. The General was thinking a little before they
came to have raiſed his Siege, but upon their encouragement
he fell on again according to their direction; and as he was
preparing for a general Aſſault, the <hi>Holland</hi> Commander,
fearful of loſing his Life and his Eſtate, beat a Parley, and
ſurrender'd the place upon Articles.</p>
               <p>During the Siege the <hi>Hollanders</hi> made a Salley, but were
beaten in again, and fourteen of their men were taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.
The <hi>Chineſes</hi> finding thoſe fourteen men in their
power, and remembering how cruel the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had been
to their Nation when they took any of them at Sea, brought
the fourteen men all together, put out one eye of each, cut
off their Noſes, Ears, and one hand, and ſo ſent them back
to the Fort, with order to tell the Commander, that the
<hi>Dutch</hi> had taught them that kind of Mercy.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of Maurice Iſland, where they cut
Ebony.</head>
               <p>THE Iſland call'd <hi>Maurice</hi> Iſland lies almoſt in 84
degrees of Longitude, and 21 degrees of Southern
Latitude, being but 2 degrees and 30 minutes from
the Tropick of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> right over againſt the middle of
the great Iſland of <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> which it has upon the Weſt,
from whence it lies 140 Leagues, and is in compaſs about
60 Leagues. It bears great quantities of Ebony: and here
it was that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> did formerly ſend their Slaves,
their baniſh'd and condemn'd Perſons, to cut that ſort of
Wood, which is Labour much more ſevere and cruel than
that of Rowing in the Galleys. The whole Iſland is ſubject
to thoſe violent and outrageous Tempeſts call'd <hi>Ouragans,</hi>
which nothing can withſtand, ſo that the People are forc'd to
dig themſelves Holes in the ground, not being able to keep
their Huts ſtanding. Neither had the poor Creatures any
other Food than a little boil'd Rice, and about a Farthings
worth of Salt-fiſh among four for a whole day. Since that
the Price of Ebony being brought very low, the <hi>Dutch</hi> have
forſaken the Iſland, the Profit not bearing the ſorry Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which thoſe poor Creatures put them to.</p>
               <p>So ſoon as this Tree is cut down it muſt be ſawed into
Planks, and then buried ſeven or eight foot deep in the
Earth, which ought to be ſomewhat moiſt. There thoſe
Planks muſt lie two years, and ſometimes three, if the Wood
be very thick. After that the Wood is fit to be wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
neither will it ſplinter or ſplit, and will the ſooner ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of a glittering Poliſhment.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Maurice</hi> Iſland puts me in mind of a Story, that the
Sieur <hi>Loocker</hi> told me, concerning what befell him in his
Voyage from <hi>Holland</hi> to <hi>Batavia</hi> in the Year 1643. <hi>Cha
Abbas</hi> the ſecond of that Name, King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> having a
great deſire to learn to paint, ſignified to the <hi>Hollanders</hi> at
<hi>Hiſpahan,</hi> that he deſired them to ſend into <hi>Holland</hi> for ſome
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:103159:55"/>
perſon who was excellent both in Deſigning and Painting.
Thereupon the Chief of the Factory wrote into <hi>Holland,</hi> and
upon his Letters the Company ſent away <hi>Loocker,</hi> to oblige
the King; and to do him the greater honour, gave him the
charge of Merchant of the Veſſel, who is equal with the
Captain, during the Voyage; to whom the Wind and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
was very favourable till they came to the <hi>Cape of Good
Hope;</hi> but after they had doubled the Point, the Pilots bare
too much to the North, whereas they ſhould have ſteered
directly Eaſt; ſo that when they had made the Height of the
Iſland of <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> they met with nothing but contrary
Winds. For it is obſervable, that all the year long there
blows but one Wind toward <hi>Maurice</hi> Iſland; ſo that a Ship
may go thither in eight or nine days, but cannot return in
thirty or forty. For you muſt ſteer Weſtward to 30 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
and from thence Eaſtward to 14 or 15 degrees, and
then you light upon <hi>Maurice</hi> Iſland. Five days together
the Ship was but rudely handled by the ſtorm; which at
length grew ſo violent, and the Sea ſo boiſterous, that all
the great Cabin was broken to pieces, the Beak of the Ship
carried away, and the Foremaſt made unſerviceable. Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
days together they remained in this miſerable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
toſs'd up and down by the Sea and Wind, all which time
they never ſaw the Sun, unable to take any height or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
where they were. The fourteenth day it cleared
up, and the Sun appeared, and then taking the Height they
obſerved themſelves to be not far from the <hi>Maurice</hi> Iſland,
which was very true; for the next day by break of day they
found themſelves not above two Leagues from the Iſland;
and they found themſelves upon the North ſide of the Iſland,
whereas the <hi>Hollanders</hi> liv'd upon the South. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
perceiving that if the Wind did not change, it would be
a long time, and that with great difficulty too, before they
could fetch a compaſs about the Iſland to come to the Fort
where the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were, they call'd a Council, where it
was reſolved that <hi>Loocker</hi> with ten Souldiers ſhould be put
on ſhoar, and that he ſhould endeavour to get to the Fort
by Land, there to make proviſion of Water and Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for the reſt of the Company, againſt they could come
about. <hi>Maurice</hi> Iſland has this advantage, to be furniſhed
with excellent Water, and great ſtore of Goats, Oranges,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:103159:55"/>
Citrons, and other Fruits: but when the <hi>Ouragans</hi> happen
there is not one to be ſeen upon the Trees, unleſs onely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thoſe which are ſhelter'd by the Ebony Boughs, which
are thick and ſtrong, and the Trees deeply rooted in the
Earth. <hi>Loocker</hi> thereupon with ten Souldiers was put on
ſhoar in a Shallop, with Proviſions for ſix days. Nor was
the Iſland in that part above eight or ten Leagues broad,
which they thought to travel in few days: but the Woods
were ſo thick, that had they not been well provided of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters
Hatchets and Axes, they could never have made
their way. The firſt day they travell'd not above a League,
and the next day not above as much more, being ſtill forced
to hack their way along with great travel and pains. So
that being now weary and ſpent, they laid themſelves upon
the ground to repoſe themſelves, and get a little ſleep.
When they wak'd they heard the voices of ſeveral people,
which much rejoyced them, believing them to be the
Slaves and poor Creatures that were cutting Ebony not far
off. Thereupon they fell to work to get as near them as
they could: but the Woods proved ſo thick, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair'd
of doing any good. Nevertheleſs the further they
advanced, the clearer they could hear the voices of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
ſome ſpeaking <hi>Dutch,</hi> others <hi>Portugueſe.</hi> Whereupon
<hi>Loocker</hi> caus'd one of the Souldiers in his company that had
a ſtrong voice, to call out in the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Language, to
the people to come and help them. But inſtead of that
they all betook themſelves to their heels, and fled to the
Commander's Lodge, telling him that there were Devils in
the Woods, and that they had call'd to them in the <hi>Portugal</hi>
Language. The Commander ſeeing both the Souldiers
and the Slaves in ſuch a diſmal amaze and terror, knew not
at firſt what to think; however he endeavoured to reſettle
their diſtraction, and to revive a ſort of people that were
half dead with fear. The next day he perſuaded them to
return to their Work, perſuading them to lay aſide their
vain Fears, which proceeded onely from idle Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
but they flatly denied him, telling him that they would
rather die, than return to be torn in pieces by the Devil.
However, others that had not been preſent at the accident,
and therefore gave not ſo much credit to the report, profer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to ſee the utmoſt of this buſineſs, provided any one that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:103159:56"/>
had heard the voice would bring them to the place. Away
upon this went a good number of them together, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the place fell to work. Now becauſe <hi>Loocker</hi> and
his Companions having labour'd all the night before, were
fallen aſleep; for a good while the Workmen heard no
voice at all, nor ſo much as any thing ſtirring, ſo that they
began to laugh at thoſe that had brought them thither, who
ſtill obſtinately maintained the truth of what they had heard.
This Diſpute at length began to grow ſo hot and ſo loud,
that at length they wak'd <hi>Loocker</hi> and his Fellows, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now got nearer to them by means of their laſt nights la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
heard diſtinctly every word they ſaid, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
their diſtreſs could not chuſe but laugh. Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Loocker</hi> and the Souldiers call'd out again, <hi>Work toward
us,</hi> they cried, <hi>we are Hollanders, come and help us out of the
Wood, and we will put an end to the diſpute.</hi> But the Workmen
no ſooner heard them, but away they ran for their Lives,
and when they came to the Lodge, they were ſo har'd, ſo
ſcar'd, and quite out of breath, that the Governour in vain
endeavour'd to get the leaſt tittle of a word from them. At
length being come to themſelves, they aſſur'd him that it
was too true that the Devils were in the Wood, and that the
more to deceive and wheedle them, to day they had not
onely ſpoken <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> but <hi>Dutch</hi> too. This put the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
and all into a deep Conſternation, inſomuch that
they were all at their Wits end. But the next morning
<hi>Loocker</hi> and his Gang having made their way through, the
Centinel ſpied them firſt from the Fort, and by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of his Muſquet gave notice of the approach of the
Devils. And then it was that the poor affrighted Mortals,
laying aſide their fears, and going forth to meet their own
Shapes, found them to be a company of their Countrymen
in diſtreſs, whom they then received into their kindneſs, to
give an account of their Misfortunes. Three days after the
Ship came into Harbour, though in a miſerable condition.</p>

               <p>THe Company to maintain their Authority and
Commerce in the <hi>Indies,</hi> believe it to be to their
advantage, that the General whom they ſend to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavia,</hi>
and who commands in all the places in <hi>Aſia</hi> where
the <hi>Dutch</hi> traffic, ſhould keep up the Port of a Prince.
There is no Cavalry in <hi>Europe</hi> ſo well clad or mounted as
his; the Horſemen all upon <hi>Perſian</hi> or <hi>Arabian</hi> Steeds. Nor
is his Foot Guard leſs ſumptuous: His Halberdiers wear
their yellow Satten Doublets, Scarlet Breeches lac'd with
Silver Lace, and their Silk Stockins. But this onely for the
General's Guards; for thoſe which they ſend abroad to their
Forts and Garriſons, it is a great pity to ſee how poorly they
are attir'd, and how meanly fed. When the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet
arrives at <hi>Batavia,</hi> the Souldiers which they bring are
drawn up in the Parade of the Fortreſs by the Major, who
chuſes out the handſomeſt to remain at <hi>Batavia,</hi> the reſt
are ſent and diſtributed into other places. When the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and his Wife go abroad, they always ride in their Coach
and ſix Horſes, with ſix Halberdiers attending at each Boot,
and a Troop of Horſe and two Companies of Foot for their
Guard. The Authority of the General is very great, though
he may be ſometimes commanded by his Wife: neither is it
ſafe for them that depend upon them, to do or ſay any thing
that may offend them. But for others, who have their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
immediately from the Company, they never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
themſelves to be ſo circumſpect. For truth whereof I
will relate the following pleaſant Story.</p>
               <p>The Wife of General <hi>Matſuker</hi> having one day underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to play upon a Captain of a Ship call'd the <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and
to laugh at him, for having loſt a Bale of Goods which had
been ſeized by the Company, in regard no particular perſon
is permitted to trade. The Captain nettled at her Diſcourſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
reſolved to be revenged. Nor was it long before he found
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:103159:57"/>
the means; for being commanded away for <hi>Maſlipatan</hi> in
the Kingdom of <hi>Goleonda,</hi> where being arriv'd, laden, and
ready to ſet Sail to return to <hi>Batavia,</hi> the chief of the Factory
deſired him to take in four Bales of Goods for the General's
Wife, as belonging to her, and to deliver them privately to
her. This was Nuts to the Captain: ſo that being return'd
to <hi>Batavia,</hi> he went he went immediately to viſit the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and deliver him the Letters which concerned the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go.</hi>
Immediately according to cuſtom the General invited
him to dinner, at which time it is uſual for the General to
inform himſelf of the Condition of the Factory. Among
the reſt of the queſtions the General asked the Captain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he had any Counterband Goods aboard, or any that
were not upon the Company's ſole account. To which
the Captain anſwered, that all the Goods belonged to the
Company, except four Bales, which the chief Factor at
<hi>Maſlipatan</hi> had particularly recommended to his care, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to Madam General. This being publickly ſpoken
in the preſence of a great many that were at Table, the Lady
that was not aware of ſuch a blow, was not a little ſurpriz'd,
and the General himſelf was not a little in wrath, ſternly
ask'd her how ſhe durſt undertake to trade without his
knowledge. Preſently ſhe denied the whole matter, and
averred that the Captain was miſtaken, and took her for ſome
other perſon. But the General ſent for the Fiſcal, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
him to go forthwith with the Captain, and fetch the
four Bales aſhoar; which being done, he order'd further
that the Goods ſhould be carried into the public Hall of the
Town Houſe, with a Writing fix'd upon them, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
own'd thoſe Goods ſhould come and claim them; but
no body came. So that the Captain had the pleaſure to ſee
the Lady in a delicate raging paſſion, and the Goods diſpos'd
of to the Fiſcal, and the Poor of the Hoſpital.</p>
               <p>The ſame General and his Wife having no Children, they
began to conſider to whom they ſhould leave their Eſtates.
At length the General bethought himſelf of a Niece he had
at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and therefore wrote to the Directors of the
Company to ſend her to him. This Niece of his cried Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbs
and Onions about the ſtreet to get her living; in which
Calling ſhe was at laſt found out, and brought to the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
who preſently changed her Habit, and of a Crier of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:103159:57"/>
Cabbage made her a little Lady; who though ſhe were of
ſuch a low condition, was not without a good proportion
of natural Beauty.</p>
               <p>The Fleet being ready to depart, there was a Cabin built
on purpoſe for this Niece, and the Company having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
her with ſeveral pieces of Tiſſue and Silks; recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
her to <hi>C. Roſſe,</hi> the Viceadmiral's care. This Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
had been ſeveral times at the <hi>Indies</hi> before, and was
both rich and a Batchelour: ſo that when the Ship was out
at Sea, he fail'd not to ſhew all the reſpects imaginable to
this Niece. Now this young Virgin not being accuſtomed
to the Sea, upon the leaſt guſt of Wind ſhe was half dead;
and all that time the Captain would not ſtir from her Bed-ſide,
for fear any Accident ſhould befall her. And as he
was thus diligent not to ſtir from her Bed-ſide in fowl, 'tis
verily believ'd he was ſeldom far from it in fair weather;
and that inſtead of ſitting by her Bed-ſide, he ſometimes got
fairly into it. But whether he were within or without,
moſt certain it is, that before Madam Niece arrived at <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavia,</hi>
ſhe found her ſelf to be with child, though ſhe ſo
diſcreetly concealed it, that none in the Veſſel percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it.</p>
               <p>The Veſſel had no ſooner paſſed the Strait that lies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>Bantam,</hi> but Madam General with a great number of
her Friends in ſeveral little Barques came out to meet Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
Niece, and were not a little ſurprized to find her to be
a perſon ſo well clad and handſom withall, without any
appearance of what ſhe had been before.</p>
               <p>A Coach and ſix Horſes, and ſix Halberdiers, a Troop
of Horſe, and a Company of Foot, waited upon the ſhoar
for Madam General. And thus was madam Niece conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Fort with great pomp, and as kindly received by
Monſieur General. Some few days after ſeveral of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants
of <hi>Batavia</hi> came picquiering to the Houſe to ſee Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
Niece; and ſo it was, that all being ſmitten, every one
deſired her in Marriage: but both Uncle and Aunt were
deaf to all their Suits, as having deſign'd her to a young rich
Merchant, who was then out of the way. <hi>C. Roſſe</hi> laugh'd
in his ſleeve at the buſtle that was made, and ſtill continued
his former reſpects and double Diligences, which were the
more willingly permitted him in regard of the great care of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:103159:58"/>
their Niece, for which the Uncle and the Aunt thought
themſelves oblig'd to him during their Voyage. But at
length ſeeing ſuch a ſwarm of Sweethearts about her, he
thought it but charity to undeceive ſo many poor Gulls, and
without further ceremony to go to her Aunt, and to demand
her Niece for his Wife. The She General who look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
herſelf to be a kind of a Queen at <hi>Batavia,</hi> look'd upon
it as a high offence and indignity for a Tarpaulin Captain
of a Ship to dare to make her ſuch a Propoſal, having alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
refus'd ſuch Matches, perſons that might come to be
Privy Counſellors of all the <hi>Indies.</hi> Nevertheleſs within a
day or two after the Captain renewed his Charge, but then
in a Majeſtic Fury ſhe utterly forbid him the Fort. He ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
little notice of her rage, goes to the General, and after
ſome Diſcourſe makes the ſame Propoſal, and receives the
ſame Anſwer. But then the Captain gave the Husband
ſuch a Bone to pick, that he would not give the Wife; Sir,
ſaid he, twice already have I demanded your Niece in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
this is now the third time that I make the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
if you refuſe me, you ſhall ask me four times before
I accept of her: and ſo ſaying briskly left him. The Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
reflecting upon the Captain's words, went to his Wife
and told her the Story, who gueſſing at the effects of a long
Voyage Familiarity, call'd Madam Niece into examination:
She not being us'd to Diſſimulation confeſs'd the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and without any more to do was married to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
to the great wonder of the whole City, till the birth
of a Boy at the end of ſix moneths unfolded the Riddle. But
this lying in was her ruin; for about five or ſix days after,
the Mother and the Nurſe being ill, the chief Chirurgeon
of the Fort order'd them to take a little <hi>Cremor Tartar;</hi> and
to that purpoſe ſent a young man to the Maſter Chirurgeon
of the Town, to ſend him two quantities of <hi>Cremor Tartar</hi>
in two Papers. He being drinking with his Friends, ſends a
young Barber newly come from <hi>Holland,</hi> to put up the two
quantities according to direction. But the Barber miſtook
the Glaſs, and put up <hi>Sublimate</hi> inſtead of <hi>Cremor Tartar.</hi> So
the two Women taking their Doſes, diſſolved in two Silver
Cups of fair Water, died in 24 hours after.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of General Vanderbroug, and of the Original
of the City of Batavia</head>
               <p>GEneral <hi>Vanderbroug</hi> was of <hi>Anverſe,</hi> and having ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
in the Jeſuits College, retained ſome tincture
of Learning, which he endeavoured to improve
as much as his buſineſs would give him leave. While he
was General he caus'd the <hi>Alcoran</hi> to be tranſlated out of
<hi>Arabic</hi> into <hi>Dutch.</hi> He was alſo a man of courage, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times expos'd himſelf to great hazards for the Service
of the Company, as you ſhall ſee by the following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
               <p>After the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had taken ſeveral Prizes from the
<hi>Portuguezes</hi> by Sea, they wanted a place of Retreat, where
they might repair their endamaged Ships, and repoſe after
the toils of the Sea. At firſt they caſt their eyes upon the
Iſland of <hi>Java,</hi> in that place where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had built a
ſmall Convenience for their Trade. There is a Road in
that part, where Veſſels ride ſecurely all the year, into which
a River diſcharges it ſelf that will receive Shallops of good
burthen, for above a thouſand Paces. The Water of this
River is moſt excellent; for being carried never ſo far to
Sea, it never ſtinks, nor engenders Worms; which can only
be ſaid of the <hi>Thames</hi> and <hi>Ganges</hi> beſides.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> therefore came and lay upon the point of
a River, over againſt the place where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had their
ſmall Houſe. They had with them then the greateſt part
of the Ships which they had in the <hi>Indies,</hi> laden with thoſe
great Bales of Cloth which come from <hi>Bengale</hi> and the Coaſt
of <hi>Surat,</hi> ſo big that a dozen men can hardly manage them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Theſe Bales they landed, and of them made a kind of Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
planting a good number of great Guns between
them: For they never wanted great Guns ever ſince they
traded alone to <hi>Japon,</hi> the onely Kingdom of the World
abounding in Copper; from whence they brought prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
quantities to <hi>Macao</hi> and <hi>Goa,</hi> where they caſt their Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:103159:59"/>
Thus the <hi>Hollanders</hi> thought that by Sea no body could
endamage their ſmall Fortification, made of Bales of cloth,
which was defended by their Veſſels which they had in the
Road: But by Land they were afraid that the King of
the Iſland, <hi>viz.</hi> either of <hi>Materan</hi> or <hi>Bantam,</hi> might di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
them. Obſerving therefore the Situation of the Iſland,
which on that ſide was all covered with Woods, which
reached on that ſide within a League of the Sea; and that
where they ended, to the Shoar there was no other way but
a Bank, which ſeparated the Marſh from the River: So that
the <hi>Hollanders</hi> the better to ſecure themſelves againſt the
two Kings, reſolved to raiſe a Tower upon the Bank. In
this Tower they planted ſeveral Culverins and ſmall Pieces,
cramm'd with artificial Wildfire, and every evening relieved
their Guards. The King of <hi>Materan</hi> perceiving this, and
believing that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> would not ſtop here, advanced
a powerful Army to pull down the Tower. To which
purpoſe he brought with him great Chains of Iron, and
Cables made of the <hi>Coco</hi> Flax; believing that by the favour
of the Night, having got his Chains and Ropes about the
Tower, by the ſtrength of his Men and Elephants he might
eaſily pull it down. But having fail'd in his Enterprize, and
for that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Artillery kill'd him abundance of
Men, he retreated with his Army. But it was not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he return'd again with a more powerful Force by Land,
and alſo a great Fleet of ſmall Veſſels to aſſiſt him by Sea.
With theſe Forces he gave a furious Onſet a ſecond time,
which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> with no leſs vigour ſuſtained, and beat
him off. But nothing diſcouraged with his loſs, he reſolved
to give a third Onſet, onely he ſtaid ſome few days in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of more Forces.</p>
               <p>In the mean while one of the moſt conſiderable Captains
of his Army was accus'd to the King not to have done his
Duty: though ſeaſonably advertiz'd that the King was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to ſeize upon his perſon, and cut him to pieces. For
you muſt know, that among the <hi>Javans</hi> when any perſon
has merited Death, they tie the Offender all along upon a
great piece of Timber, and the next Lord or great perſon
that has a mind to try the goodneſs of his Scimitar, comes
and cuts the Body into four pieces, the firſt ſtroak being made
upon the Breſt, the ſecond upon the Pit of the Stomach, the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103159:59"/>
third upon the lower part of the Belly. The four pieces
if they be Men, are burnt; if Women, thrown to the Dogs,
which they keep for that purpoſe. For the <hi>Javans</hi> never
burn any perſon.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Javaneſe</hi> Lord therefore knowing what he was to
truſt to, made his eſcape to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and was kindly
received by <hi>Vanderbroug.</hi> To ingratiate himſelf, he told
the <hi>Dutch</hi> General all the King's Deſigns in reference to the
carrying the place; where he would make his Onſet, and
what number of men he had. This however did not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
chear up the General, who knew his own weakneſs.
So that the <hi>Javaneſe</hi> perceiving him ſtill penſive, I find (ſaid
he) that thou art afraid of the King's ſtrength, and reaſon
thou haſt, but be rul'd by me: Thou art not ignorant that
the <hi>Javanners</hi> are rigid Obſervers of the Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
and that if any Uncleanneſs from a Chriſtian hand falls upon
their Clothes, they fling them away, and ſpend ſix whole
days in waſhing themſelves, before they believe themſelves
clean. Hear then, ſaid he; let all the Ordure and Dung of
the People that are with thee be heaped in a place together,
and made fluid in Pots for that purpoſe; and when they
mount their Ladders, ſpare not for Showres of that Liquor,
and I warrant ye they will retreat faſter than they came on.
Farther continued he; I know that the points of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
and <hi>Cric's</hi> are poiſon'd, and that this poiſon is ſo
ſtrong, that whoever are wounded therewith die ſuddenly,
unleſs they have recourſe to this onely Remedy; which is to
preſerve their own Excrement, and to dry it to powder;
and when they find themſelves wounded, to take a little of
the powder, and drink it off in a ſmall Beer-glaſs of Water.
The General obſerving what the <hi>Javan</hi> Lord had ſaid, when
the Enemy mounted their Ladders, luſtily beſmear'd them
with the Liquor, which he caus'd to be prepar'd againſt their
coming; ſo that inſtead of gaining the tops of their Ladders,
they made all the haſte they could down again; but being
hindred by thoſe that follow'd them, they threw themſelves
headlong to the ground; by which means ſeveral of them
were maimed, and ſeveral kill'd outright. Thus the Army
disbanded in a moment, and the Emperour was the firſt that
took his flight. <hi>Vanderbroug</hi> obſerving the diſorderly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
of the Enemy, took a ſmall Party with him, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu'd
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103159:60"/>
the flying Enemy, who being encloſed by thoſe in the
Fort, that ſally'd out upon them, were miſerably cut in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
But the General having left the greateſt part of his
men, and returning onely with a ſmall and very inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Company, the <hi>Javanners</hi> who had hid themſelves in
the Merſhes for fear, reſum'd courage, and ſuddenly fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him in his return, and ſo encompaſs'd him on every ſide,
that it was impoſſible for him to eſcape. However they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
themſelves ſtoutly for a while, but being wounded
with the Arrows and <hi>Cric's</hi> of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and not being
provided of the forementioned Antidote, they died imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.
The General was taken alive, not ſo much as
wounded; for as he told me afterwards himſelf, he found
they had no deſire to kill him. So ſoon as he was taken
they carried him to the Emperour, who as ſoon as he ſaw
him bid him not fear any thing, but told him withall, that
it was his pleaſure, that he ſhould command his Men to
quit the Fort and Tower, and be gone; otherwiſe that he
would make both him, and all thoſe that ſhould fall into
his Hands, perpetual Slaves. At the ſame time the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
with his principal Officers, and the General with a good
Guard, came to the Foot of the Wall of the Tower, where
the General in the <hi>Malay</hi> Language, laying before them
his own misfortune, and the improbability of their holding
out long, commanded them to quit the Fort, after they had
embarqued whatever they ſaw fitting, but onely 6 Pieces of
ſmall Canon, 200 Bullets, and 500 Quintals of Powder.
The Emperour was overjoy'd to hear what the General ſaid,
and thought himſelf ſure of the Fort and Tower. But then
the General turning to the Emperour, told him, that none
of his men underſtood <hi>Malay,</hi> and that therefore it would
be convenient for him to repeat the ſame in <hi>Flemiſh.</hi>
Which being granted, he ſpoke to the Souldiers in <hi>Flemiſh,</hi>
and ordered them quite the contrary; that is to ſay, that
they ſhould not be Traitors to their Countrey, but hold out
the place till death, not minding what became of him; and
to that end, that they ſhould bid the Infidels forthwith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
or elſe they would immediately fire all their Guns up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them. The Emperour aſtoniſh'd at their Reſolution re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats,
and carries the General with him. Being thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd,
the General made him believe that he would find a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:103159:60"/>
means to write to the Company, to give them an account
of what had paſs'd, and that he was confident they would
give ſuch order for an Accommodation, as ſhould ſatisfie
His Majeſty, which ſatisfi'd the Emperour for that time. In
the mean while the General found an opportunity to get
into a ſmall Barque, and to get to the Fort, where he was joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
receiv'd. This Recital I had from his own mouth.</p>
               <p>The General having done this and ſeveral other eminent
Services for the Company, and acquitted himſelf with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
and a fair Eſtate, was deſirous to return home,
where the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and ſeveral of the States had
no leſs a deſire to ſee him. Streight he took up his Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and for a good while liv'd ſplendidly,
gave great Preſents and Entertainments to the Prince, and
ſeveral other Grandees of <hi>Holland,</hi> by which means he ran
himſelf into ſo great an Expence, that he was forc'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of the Company, that he might return into their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>One day the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> asking him what Rarities
he had brought out of the <hi>Indies,</hi> he call'd for five Silver
Plates, and ſetting them upon the Table, drew out five
little Bags out of his Pocket, and emptied a ſeveral Bag up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a ſeveral Plate; which ſurpriz'd not onely the Prince,
but ſeveral others of the States then preſent, to ſee ſuch a
number of Diamonds and other Jewels of a vaſt value.</p>
               <p>It was not without ſome difficulty that he was again en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
by the Company; but at length they ſent him Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
of two Ships to <hi>Batavia,</hi> where being arriv'd, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
and Conſuls made him Admiral of the Fleet that was
juſt bound for the Coaſt of <hi>Coromandel, Surat,</hi> and <hi>Perſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being return'd to <hi>Batavia,</hi> General <hi>Vandyme</hi> and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
ſent him to <hi>Malaca,</hi> which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> then beſieg'd,
and where they found a ſtouter reſiſtance than they imagin'd.
There in an aſſault upon the Town he received a ſlight
Wound, of which he was quickly cur'd; but ſoon after he
fell ſick, and died before the Town was ſurrendred.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Country about Cochin, and how the Holland
General crown'd one of the Indian Princes.</head>
               <p>ALL the Countrey about <hi>Cochin</hi> is planted for the
moſt part with that ſort of Tree which they call
<hi>Cocos,</hi> the Fruit whereof produces that ſort of Wine
which the Inhabitants call <hi>Tary,</hi> whereof they make their
Strong Water. They mingle this Wine with courſe black
Sugar unrefin'd, together with the Bark of a Tree which
bears nothing but Thorns. This Bark cauſes the <hi>Tary</hi> and
Sugar to boil and ferment like new Wine. When the <hi>Tary</hi>
and the Sugar have fermented for above ſeven or eight hours,
they diſtill them in an Alembic, and make Strong Water,
which is ſtronger or ſmaller, by how much the more often or
ſeldomer it is diſtill'd.</p>
               <p>Beſides the Coverture of theſe Trees the whole Country
is full of Cows; for they are all Idolaters in this Country,
that onely worſhip their Cows for their Gods, feed upon
their Milk, and eat nothing that has Life.</p>
               <p>When you leave the Countries of theſe Princes, which
they call <hi>Rajas,</hi> travelling toward the North Eaſt you enter
into the Territories of the <hi>Raja</hi> of <hi>Velouche,</hi> which are of a
large extent. He and all his Subjects being Idolaters, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it be about nine or ten thouſand poor People call'd <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
of S. John,</hi> as being baptiz'd after the ſame manner that
S. <hi>John</hi> baptiz'd the People in the Wilderneſs.</p>
               <p>After the taking of <hi>Cochin,</hi> of which we have given a full
Relation in our <hi>Indian</hi> Travels, General <hi>Vangous,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
at the Siege, became ſo haughty that he deſpis'd
all the other Officers, as well Military as thoſe that belonged
to the Government and Juſtice of the City. However to
recompence one of the <hi>Raja's</hi> by whoſe means he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the City, he perſuaded him to quit the Name of <hi>Raja,</hi>
and to aſſume the Title of <hi>King,</hi> that he might have the
Honour to ſet the Crown upon his Head. To this end he
made great inquiry through his whole Army for a Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:103159:61"/>
and having found out one that undertook it, and
caus'd him to make a Crown of maſſie Gold, that weigh'd
near ten Marks, which I believe the <hi>Raja</hi> found more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient
and weighty upon his Head, than an old Muc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kender
with three corners bound about his Head, which is the
mark of the <hi>Raja</hi>'s Sovereignty.</p>
               <p>While they were making this Crown there were great
preparations for the Ceremony: It was performed in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
near the Town, where was ſet a large Tent ſpread all
over with painted Calicut. Within was a Throne erected
with a Canopy of <hi>China</hi> Damask, and all the Steps to the
Throne were cover'd with <hi>Perſian</hi> Tapiſtry.</p>
               <p>The day being come, the greateſt part of the Army, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and Souldiers, went to fetch the <hi>Raja,</hi> who lay in his
Hut a quarter of a League off; where they mounted him
upon one of two Elephants which the General ſent him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
attended likewiſe with two led Horſes, and two <hi>Palan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quins</hi>
for more State. Being come to the place, he was clad
in a Scarlet Robe with great Hanging Sleeves, and ſo brought
in where <hi>Vangous</hi> was ſitting upon his Throne, with a
Sword and a Crown by him. The <hi>Raja</hi> being come to the
Foot of the Throne, the Major of the Army took the Sword,
deliver'd him by the General, and girt the <hi>Raja,</hi> who then
aſcending the Steps of the Throne, proſtrated himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Holland</hi> General while he put the Crown upon his
Head. Then the new King riſeth up, and lays his Hand
upon the Head of a Cow that ſtood near the Throne. Which
done, kneeling with his Hands claſp'd, and lifted toward
the Head of the ſame Cow, he took his Oath to be true and
faithful to the Company, and to embrace their Intereſts.
On the other ſide the General promis'd him on the behalf of
the Company, that they ſhould aſſiſt him when he ſhould
have occaſion againſt his Enemies. Which Solemnities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very gravely perform'd, the Muſquettiers gave three
Volleys, and the new King was conducted back to his Hut
with the ſame Pomp that he was brought. Thus you ſee the
Pride of a Pepper Merchant, to make Kings and domineer
over Crowns.</p>
               <p>One other famous Act of <hi>Vangous</hi> muſt not be forgotten.
You muſt know, that at the taking of <hi>Cochin</hi> the Jeſuits had
in that City one of the faireſt Libraries in all <hi>Aſia,</hi> as well
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:103159:62"/>
for the great quantity of Books ſent them out of <hi>Europe,</hi> as
for ſeveral rare Manuſcripts in the <hi>Hebrew, Chaldee, Arabic,
Perſian, Indian, Chineſe,</hi> and other Oriental Languages. For
in all the Conqueſts of the <hi>Portugals,</hi> their firſt care was to
ſummon all the Learned People of the ſeveral Nations, and
to get all their Books into their hands. During that little
time which the Jeſuits ſtaid in <hi>Aethiopia</hi> they had copied out
all the good Books that came to their knowledge, and ſent
all thoſe Books of <hi>Cochin.</hi> They had ſtaid longer in <hi>Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi>
had it not been for the Jealouſie of the Patriarchs, and
their Biſhops, which are very numerous; ſo that if there be
two men in one Village that belong to one Church, the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
calls himſelf Biſhop. At their Ceremonies of Baptiſm
when they name the Holy Ghoſt, they apply a hot Iron to
the neck of the Infant, ſaying that the Holy Ghoſt deſcended
upon the Apoſtles in the ſhape of Fiery Tongues. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs
and Biſhops were jealous of the Jeſuits, finding that
they had inſinuated themſelves into the favour of the King
and Grandees of the Court. Which ſo enraged the <hi>Aethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
that they caus'd the People to mutiny, preaching that
the King was about to alter the Religion of the Country, and
to draw along with him ſeveral of the Lords. And the
Fury of the People grew to that height, that whatever the
King could do or ſay, he could not appeaſe their Fury: So
that they put him in priſon, and elected his Brother in his
place. The cauſe of this diſorder was laid upon the Jeſuits,
and was the reaſon that they were expell'd the Kingdom;

               <head type="sub">Of the Sieur Hollebrand Glins, Preſident of the
Factory at Ormus.</head>
               <p>WHen the Ships come to <hi>Ormus,</hi> it is a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
for the Goods to lie out of doors. For
ſuch is the extremity of the Heat in that part,
that if the Spices, eſpecially the Cloves, be not carried to the
Water-ſide every foot, and there laid to ſteep in the Water
for four and twenty hours, they would turn to a mere
powder.</p>
               <p>Sugar is brought thither in great Wooden Cheſts, but if
there be the leaſt Cleft for a Fly or an Emmet to get in, in a
ſmall time the Cheſt will be half emptied.</p>
               <p>As for Camphire, which is brought from <hi>Borneo</hi> in Pipes,
if it lie a little too long in that warm Air, it will exhale above
half away.</p>
               <p>To remedy theſe Inconveniences <hi>Sieur Hollebrand</hi> reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to build a bigger Warehouſe. Among the reſt of the
Workmen that were imployed in this Building was a Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith,
who came in the <hi>interim</hi> in a Ship from <hi>Batavia.</hi>
This poor Fellow was imployed to make Locks for the
Warehouſe; for in thoſe Parts they have no other Keys, or
Locks either, than what are made of Wood: So that it was
a Crime for him to be found idle at any time. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Preſident finding him one Sunday in the Afternoon
drinking with two of his Companions that came from the
Ship to ſee him, gave the Fellow half a dozen good Licks
with his Cane, and would have given him more, but that
the Smith being a ſturdy Fellow, and feeling the Blows ſmart,
wreſted the Stick out of the Preſident's Hands, and flung it
out of the Window. For which the Preſident, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
that the Fellow had ſtruck him four Blows, which was
untrue, as I my ſelf being there could witneſs, ſent him la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with Chains to the Ship, where he would have tried
him for his Life, in a full Court of the Merchants of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory:
but they refuſing him, for very madneſs he took
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:103159:63"/>
two Notaries, that he had a power over, went to the Ship
alone, made the Officers of the Ship, and condemn'd the
Fellow to be hang'd. And he had certainly been executed
but for me and ſome other of my Countrymen, (for the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
was of <hi>Geneva</hi>) that threatned the Preſident out of his
deſign. Yet he caus'd him to be drubb'd Naked at the
Main Maſt after that inhuman manner, that he loſt the uſe
of one of his Arms. This the <hi>Geneveſe</hi> could never forget,
and therefore ſought all opportunities to kill him; to which
purpoſe he put himſelf in the ſame Ship with <hi>Hollebrand</hi>
when he returned for <hi>Holland.</hi> But coming to the <hi>Cape of
Good Hope,</hi> and being ſent aſhoar in the Shallop for Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the Shallop was overſet in a ſtormy Sea, and <hi>Hollebrand</hi>'s
Life thereby ſecur'd.</p>
               <p>But before we leave <hi>Ormus,</hi> where <hi>Hollebrand</hi> was build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Warehouſe that caus'd all this miſchief, let us take
notice of this by the way, that there is no abiding at <hi>Ormus</hi>
till <hi>April,</hi> leſt you pay for your ſtay with ſome Malignant
Fever, that may hold a man as long as he lives; or if he be
cur'd by chance, yet will the White of his Eyes be more yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
than Saffron. This ſame ſort of Fever ſeizes our <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans</hi>
in the Port of <hi>Alexandretta</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> and in the Iſlands
where the <hi>Hollanders</hi> lade their Cloves, Nutmegs, and
Mace.</p>
               <p>By the way obſerve, that there is a particular ſort of Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meg
which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> call <hi>Maneque,</hi> and we the Male
Nutmeg, as long again and a little bigger than the ordinary
Nutmeg; and this ſort they never carry into <hi>Europe,</hi> becauſe
they ſell it to better profit in <hi>Perſia</hi> and the <hi>Indies.</hi> This I
ſhall alſo further add, that the ordinary Nutmeg condited,
fuddles more than the ſtrongeſt Wine, eating but onely one
either at the beginning or ending of the Meal.</p>

               <head type="sub">Touching the Iſlands of the Prince.</head>
               <p>THE Fort of <hi>Batavia</hi> has four fair Baſtions, and is
well built but upon an ill Foundation, thoſe Baſtions
being plainly obſerv'd to ſink, and requiring Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from time to time. For the perfecting of which Work
the <hi>Hollanders</hi> wanted Slaves: whereupon a Conſultation
was had where to get Slaves. To which Anſwer was made,
that there was no better place than the Prince's Iſlands.
Which being concluded, the General of <hi>Batavia</hi> diſpatch'd
away three the biggeſt Ships belonging to <hi>Batavia.</hi> Theſe
Ships viſited every one of theſe Iſlands; feigning that they
came from <hi>Holland</hi> and wanted Refreſhment. So ſoon as
the Inhabitants diſcover'd the Veſſels, they flock'd to the
Shoar Men, Women, and Children, as they wont to do,
bringing along with them the beſt of their Proviſion, as <hi>Coco</hi>
Wine, Nuts, and other Fruits of the growth of the Iſlands.
Happy were they that could firſt get aboard, for they always
get more by the Mariners and Souldiers, than by thoſe that
go aſhoar to trade. Now ſo ſoon as they were aſhoar, they
gave them Strong Water to drink till they were drunk; and
when the Maſters of the Ships ſaw them in that condition,
they immediately ſent a good number of their men well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
aſhoar, who bound them that were upon the Sand to
truck for their goods, and carried them away to their Ships,
killing all thoſe that made any reſiſtance. But they did them
little ſervice; for finding themſelves ſo inhumanly us'd as
the <hi>Hollanders</hi> uſe their Slaves, they took a reſolution to eat
nothing, and to ſtarve themſelves to death, rather than to be
forc'd to labour and be beaten every day.</p>

               <head type="sub">How the Hollanders ſent to declare War against the
Perſians, and of the ill Succeſs of their Fleet.</head>
               <p>MUch about the ſame time <hi>Charles Conſtant</hi> was ſent
by the Company with a Fleet of ſeven great
Ships, to declare War againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> in caſe
they would not comply with the <hi>Dutch</hi> in reference to their
Silk Trade and their Cuſtoms. Being arriv'd at <hi>Ormus</hi> he
left the Fleet there, and haſten'd to <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> and from thence
to <hi>Casbin,</hi> where then the King was. But his Embaſſie had
not that effect as he expected: For he thought that the King
would have been frighted at the noiſe of a Fleet of ſeven
great Ships that lay at <hi>Ormus,</hi> but he was miſtaken. For
the <hi>Perſian</hi> knew he need not ſend any Force againſt the
ſaid Fleet, in regard it would be ruin'd without: It being
impoſſible for our <hi>Europeans</hi> to ſtay at <hi>Ormus</hi> in the heat of
Somer, as well by reaſon of the Heat, as for want of Water;
for there is no good Water at <hi>Ormus,</hi> nor upon any part of
the Coaſt of <hi>Perſia,</hi> but what is kept in Ciſterns, and that
full of Worms. 'Tis true, that upon the Coaſt of <hi>Arabia</hi>
there are Wells of good Water, but when the <hi>Arabians</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
any Ships upon the Coaſt, they come down all in
Arms to defend their Wells; for it is their profit to ſell their
Water, and that at a very dear rate, to thoſe that are in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.</p>
               <p>Now the King and Council not being ignorant, that the
longer the Fleet lay at <hi>Ormus,</hi> the worſe would be its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
would not give the Commander his firſt Audience
in two moneths. During which time there died above half
the Men; for from ſix a clock in the morning till four in the
afternoon, if any of the Seamen went to take a little Air
upon the Deck, he preſently fell down dead. The Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
was to blame not to make proviſion of Water being
bound for ſuch a place as <hi>Ormus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Commander <hi>Conſtant</hi> did not take the right courſe
to effect his buſineſs, by publiſhing what he intended to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:103159:64"/>
the Miniſters of State withall. For the Lords of <hi>Perſia</hi>
never take any Preſents themſelves, for fear it ſhould come
to the King's Ear. But there is a private Bill ſent to the
Party for whom it is intended, and he ſends whom he thinks
fit to receive it. Had he ſo done, and doubled his Sum of
5000 <hi>Venetian</hi> Ducats, perhaps the <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> might have
us'd him more kindly, eſpecially for ſo long time as that
King had. For whatever a Predeceſſor does, a Succeſſor
changes many things. So that if the deceaſed King have
given any Houſe or Land to any perſon, it muſt be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the ſucceeding King in his firſt Year, or elſe the Gift
returns to the King. It is the ſame thing if any perſon builds
a Houſe upon the King's Demeſns: which has been a great
inconvenience to the <hi>Auſtin</hi> Friers and bare-foot <hi>Carmelites,</hi>
becauſe their Houſes are built upon the Lands which
<hi>Cha Abbas</hi> gave them of the Royal Demeſns. So that
every time a new King aſcends the Throne, they are forc'd
to make the <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> new Preſents, ſometimes to the
Value of the Land: for it is a rare thing to find a prime
Miniſter that is a Friend to the Chriſtians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the Jeſuits
and Capuchins, who came after them, provided better for
themſelves, each of thoſe Orders having bought the Ground
upon which their Houſes are built.</p>
               <p>The Commander ſeeing that he could not compaſs his
Deſign, and that the <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> would abate nothing of
the forty four <hi>Tomans</hi> which he demanded, went to the
<hi>Divanbegai</hi> and told him, that buying the ſame Goods of
particular perſons, they might be had for thirty two, or at
moſt for thirty three <hi>Tomans.</hi> To which the <hi>Divanbegai</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
him, That all thoſe particular perſons paid the King
Cuſtom, and Convoy upon the Road, the Cuſtom alone
amounting to Eighteen <hi>per cent.</hi> which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> did
not pay: and that there was not a Year wherein they did
not bring in Goods to the Value of 30000 <hi>Tomans;</hi> and that
if account ſhould be taken of the Silks which they carried
away, and of the Goods which they brought in, the <hi>Athema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doulet</hi>
ought to make them pay near 50000 <hi>Tomans</hi> for Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
The Commander ill ſatisfied with this Anſwer went
to his Lodging, and without asking the Advice of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
that were with him, or of his <hi>Frenchman,</hi> who better
underſtood the Practice of the Court, or without taking his
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:103159:65"/>
leave of the King, return'd privately to <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> intending
for <hi>Bander</hi> where the Fleet lay. The <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> being
advertiz'd of his ſudden departure, was very much offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
ſo much the more becauſe at the Commanders firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
he had done him great Civilities, even to the furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Lodgings after the <hi>European</hi> manner, with a Bed,
Stools, and Tables. Thereupon he gave notice thereof to
the King, who when he heard of it utter'd theſe words,
<hi>Has any one given him any diſtaſte, or is he turn'd Fool? He ſhall be
glad to come back again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being come to <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> to the great wonder of the <hi>Franks,</hi>
who heard nothing of his taking leave of the King, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to make up his Pack, intending for <hi>Gomrom,</hi> in caſe the
King did not ſend for him again; which he did, 'tis true, but
not with thoſe Compliments which he expected; for he
flatter'd himſelf that the King would have petition'd him to
return. The King ſent for him indeed, but his Compliment
was not very pleaſing; for the perſon that brought the
Meſſage told him, That it was the King's pleaſure he ſhould
ſpeedily return, and if he would not go willingly he had
order to carry him by force. But notwithſtanding the King's
Command and the Counſel of his Friends, he ſet out from
<hi>Iſpahan</hi> for <hi>Bander,</hi> according to his firſt intent. We accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
him ſome part of his way, and being juſt ready to
take our leaves, we ſaw a <hi>Perſian</hi> Gentile and well mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
(he was a Captain of an hundred men) who calling the
Interpreter to him, Go (ſaid he) and tell thy Preſident, that
he muſt return to his Lodging, and to morrow make haſte
to the King, according to the Order he has already recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
and with that he rode away full ſpeed. The Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter
told the Commander what the Captain ſaid; but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all this the Commander being a perſon of a
hot and obſtinate humour, continued his way. Neither the
Merchants of <hi>Zulpha,</hi> nor any of the <hi>Perſian</hi> or <hi>Armenian</hi>
Servants would follow him, fearing the Baſtinado, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
he was ſecure enough; as it happen'd: for he had
not rode far, before three Captains with their Bows and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
in their hands bolted out upon him, one of which ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
up directly to the Commander, Art thou (ſaid he) the
onely perſon that ever ſet foot in this Empire, that refuſeſt
to obey the Companion of the Sun, whom ſo great a part
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:103159:65"/>
of the World obeys? At the ſame time came up fifty ſtout
Horſemen, and one of them who cammanded them made
at Mr. <hi>Conſtant</hi> with his Mace. Then the Admiral was
forc'd to lower his Sails and return back, forc'd to receive an
Affront which he might have avoided<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When he was come
to his Lodging, the <hi>Perſian</hi> Officer without alighting call'd
the Interpreter, and bid him go forwarn the Commander
in the Name of the King, that neither he nor any of the
<hi>Hollanders</hi> preſumed to ſtir out of their Houſes till further
order; for that if any of them were ſeen abroad, they ſhould
be taught to obey the King's Commands. Thus the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
having been coop'd up nine days, word was brought
the Commander he might return to <hi>Cusbin,</hi> where he found
that all his <hi>Rodomontado's</hi> ſignified nothing, but that he muſt
comply with the <hi>Athemadoulet.</hi>

go off better at <hi>Batavia</hi> than in <hi>Holland,</hi> left her to the care
of General <hi>Com,</hi> who ſucceeded him in his charge. The
Girl was fair and left rich, ſo that her Father was no ſooner
gone, but ſhe had many Suitors that courted her, without
any conſideration of her Birth, among all which there was
none that ſhe fancied, like one that was a Superior Merchant
of the Fort, for whom ſhe had a particular eſteem. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did ſhe believe but that General <hi>Com</hi> would have given
his conſent upon the firſt requeſt, knowing the young man

that the General upon notice how Affairs went, would mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

had revealed the Myſtery, he was ſo far from anſwering
their expectation, that he threw the young Man laden
with Fetters into priſon, and ſhut up the young Woman cloſe
Priſoner in her Chamber. Next day he call'd a Council,
declar'd to them the Matter of Fact, and gave his Opinion,
that the young man deſerv'd to loſe his Head, and that the

               <p>OFttimes when Women think that their Amours are

the Secretary of the Hoſpital, as handſom a perſon as
any was in the City, had a Wife that paſs'd for a <hi>Batavian</hi>

had been ſeven years married without any Children; ſo
that the Woman deſpairing of her Husband's Abilities, and
to know where the fault lay, reſolved to beſtow her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
upon one of her Slaves, who was well ſhap'd but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
black; chuſing rather a private Familiarity with him, than
with any young <hi>Hollander,</hi> whoſe frequent Viſits might
breed ſuſpicion. It ſeems the fault did not lie in her, for
her Sable Gallant had ſo improv'd his Talent, that in a ſhort
time ſhe found the effects of Change. In ſhort, the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
Belly ſwell'd, and her Husband thinking his time had
been come, began to boaſt of his Manhood, and great Joy
there was among the Friends of the Woman upon the hopes
of Iſſue. Great Proviſions were made againſt the Lying in,
and the General himſelf made choice of for Godfather. But
when the good hour was come, and the Woman delivered,
their Joy was turned into Mourning, for the Child prov'd
one of the ſooty Of-ſpring of the Sun-burnt race, a perfect
Black. The Husband and Mother of the Woman bluſh'd as
red for ſhame as the Child was black, and the Goſſips hung
down their heads like Bulruſhes: nay the Husband was ſo
tranſported with fury, that he could not hide his reſolution
to murder his Wife, for bringing ſuch a piece of live Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cole
into the world. But he was prevented, and ſecur'd in
the Fort by the General, till by the intermiſſion of Friends,
who wiſely laid before him the original cauſe of his Wifes
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:103159:67"/>
Tranſgreſſion, they were at length made Friends, and the
Slave for having ſhew'd himſelf a Man, was condemn'd to
tug at the Oars in the Galleys that go to fetch Stone for the
uſe of the City.</p>
               <p>Now as a White Woman may bring forth a Black, ſo
ſometimes a Black may be deliver'd of a White Child. For
at <hi>Baçaim</hi> a <hi>Cafer</hi>'s Wife, as black as himſelf, was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
of a white Child. The <hi>Cafer</hi> ſeeing his Child white,
would have immediately fallen upon his Wife and ſtrangled
her, had not the good women that aſſiſted at her Labour
prevented him, and one of thoſe Goſſips was ſo cunning as
to run to the Jeſuits Houſe, who are well reſpected by
thoſe Blacks, to deſire Father <hi>Thomas de Bare,</hi> who had a
long time been Rector at <hi>Agra,</hi> to come to the <hi>Cafer</hi>'s Houſe.
Preſently the Father came with another of the Fraternity,
and finding the <hi>Cafer</hi> ſtamping and ſtaring almoſt out of
his wits, and in open hoſtility without all reaſon, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe
his fury ask'd him whether he kept any Hens, and
whether he had any that were black. The <hi>Cafer</hi> anſwer'd
that he did keep Hens, and that he had likewiſe black Hens.
Preſently the Father order'd one to be brought him; and
then holding it in both his hands before the good Women,
Does this Hen (ſaid he to the <hi>Cafer</hi>) lay thee any Eggs?
Yes, replied the <hi>Cafer.</hi> Of what colour are they, ſaid the
Father? White, anſwer'd the <hi>Cafer.</hi> Well then, ſaid the
Father, thou art worſe than thy ſilly Creature, and haſt far
leſs reaſon; for if this Hen which is black lay thee white
Eggs, why may not thy Wife which is black bring thee a
white Child? This Compariſon ſo wrought upon the
<hi>Cafer,</hi> who was no Diſputant, that he embrac'd his Wife,
kiſs'd his Child, and all was well again. Though for all
the Jeſuit's Compariſon it was believ'd that ſome <hi>Portugal</hi>
Souldier had quarter'd with his Wife, which was the reaſon
of that more than uſual Production.</p>
               <p>To conclude, there was a certain woman, the wife of
one of the Counſellors of <hi>Batavia,</hi> who had both kindneſs
and affection for a Merchant of the Fort, who was both
young and handſom. And it is the Cuſtom in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
to be not onely kind but free, ſhe had for ſeveral years
ſo well ſupplied his wants, that he was Company for the
beſt. It happen'd that this Counſellor was ſent abroad up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:103159:67"/>
ſome Negotiation, and ſtaid longer than he thought he
ſhould have done. For this reaſon Money grew ſhort with
the Lady; ſo that her Gallant coming for a Supply, and ſhe
not having ready money to anſwer his Expectations, ſhe
gave him a Gold Chain worth 400 Crowns to pawn for his
preſent Neceſſities till ſhe could redeem it. But this Fatal
Chain was the diſſolution of all their former Love: For the
young Gentleman being ſtreighten'd for Money, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no perſon that would lend him ſo much Money as he
wanted upon it, very fairly goes and offers it to a Goldſmith
to ſell. While this unfortunate Lover was driving his Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
in the Shop, who in the name of ill luck ſhould come
by but one of his Miſtreſſes Slaves, and ſpying the Chain in
his hand, runs and tells her Patroneſs how ſhe had ſeen her
Gallant imploy'd. Who ſurpriz'd that her Gallant ſhould
go about to ſell the Chain, when he had onely promis'd to
pawn it in private and ſure hands; now (quoth ſhe) all will
out, there will be the Devil upon Dun when my Husband
comes home; and I forſooth that have liv'd credibly thus
long, muſt be the ſport of my Neighbours and the talk of
the Town. This produc'd a Duel between Love and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
wherein Intereſt getting the victory, away ſhe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
ſends to all the Goldſmiths, to give them notice
that ſhe had been robb'd of a Gold Chain, deſiring them to
apprehend the Party that brought it. She alſo gave the ſame
notice to the chief of the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> and deſir'd the Advocate
Fiſcal to make a public Search. Well, by theſe means the
Chain was quickly found, and the Merchant whatever he
could ſay for himſelf was apprehended and put in priſon;
ſoon after he was condemned for a Thief, and ſentenced to
row all his life in the Stone Galley, which is the Galley
that fetches Stones for the uſe of <hi>Batavia.</hi> But happy for
him, General <hi>Vanderlin</hi>'s Lady falling into a hard Labour
before the time of Execution, and deſiring his Pardon at
ſuch a ſolemn Juncture, eaſily obtain'd it, ſeaſonably reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
him from the Misfortunes of Folly and Neceſſity.</p>

RELATION

JAPON,
AND
Of the Cauſe of the Perſecution of the Chriſtians
in thoſe ISLANDS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Modern Geographers have made
Deſcriptions of <hi>Japon,</hi> by means of
ſuch conjectures as they have drawn
from the Relations of certain Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
who have traded in thoſe
Countries. But in regard there are
very few Merchants who are skilful
in <hi>Geography,</hi> as being ſuch who only
mind the profit and advantage of
their Voyages, thoſe Deſcriptions
have prov'd very uncertain. As to
the knowledge of the Ancients, in
reference to this part of the World,
it is no leſs imperfect; and it is but
only by conjecture to this day, that we believe the <hi>Abadii</hi> of <hi>Ptolomy</hi>
to be that Iſland which is now call'd <hi>Niphon.</hi> That which I could learn
of moſt certainty, was by the Relation of ſeveral perſons who have
Travell'd theſe parts, that the Empire of <hi>Japon</hi> is at preſent compos'd
of ſeveral Iſlands, of which ſome perhaps may not be abſolute Iſlands,
but rather <hi>Peninſula's,</hi> and particularly thoſe that make a part of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103159:69"/>
Land of <hi>Yeſſo,</hi> the Inhabitants whereof are Vaſſals and Tributaries to
<hi>Japon.</hi> Nevertheleſs a <hi>Holland</hi> Pilot, who has been induſtrious to
diſcover whether the whole Country it ſelf were an Iſland, or a
Continent adjoyning to that vaſt Tract of Land call'd <hi>Corea,</hi> unknown
to this day, in thoſe parts where it extends it ſelf behind <hi>China</hi> to the
bottom of <hi>Tartarie Niulhan,</hi> ſaith, that it is ſeparated from <hi>Japon</hi> by a
narrow Sea, which at this day is call'd <hi>The Streights of</hi> Sanguar.
Through all the Iſlands of <hi>Japon,</hi> where formerly were accompted to
have been 66 Kingdoms, there are three remarkable for their largeneſs,
of which that of largeſt extent is called <hi>Niphon,</hi> the next <hi>Ximo,</hi> and
the third <hi>Xicock.</hi> The <hi>Japonners</hi> accompt it a Journey of twenty ſeven
days from the Province of <hi>Quanto,</hi> to the Country of <hi>Yeſſo;</hi> and they
ſay farther, that this Country of <hi>Yeſſo,</hi> in thoſe parts which are remote
from the Sea, is ſo full of inacceſſible Mountains, that thoſe <hi>Japonners</hi>
who have attempted a diſcovery by Land, could never accompliſh their
deſign, being diſcourag'd by the length of the Journey, and the
difficulties and badneſs of the ways.</p>
            <p>The Iſland of <hi>Niphon</hi> is four times as big as the other two; and there
is alſo a Mountain therein that vomits up Flames of Fire, like Mount
<hi>Etna</hi> in <hi>Sicily;</hi> formerly it was diſtinguiſh'd into thirty five Kingdoms,
but at this day it is only divided into five parts, the names whereof are
<hi>Jamaſoit, Jetſen, Jetſeſen, Quanto,</hi> and <hi>Ochio,</hi> lying all in order as you
travel from Weſt to Eaſt. Theſe five parts are again divided into
ſeveral Provinces. The Iſland of <hi>Ximo,</hi> or <hi>Saycock,</hi> is ſituated to the
South-Weſt of <hi>Niphon,</hi> being about 160 Leagues in circuit. The Iſland
of <hi>Xicock</hi> is ſeated by the South of <hi>Niphon,</hi> being about 120 Leagues in
compaſs. The other Iſlands that lye round about are not ſo conſiderable,
for in thoſe Seas lye ſeveral Iſlands ſcatter'd up and down, as in the <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelago,</hi>
between the <hi>Morea</hi> and the Coaſts of <hi>Aſia</hi> the leſs. As to the
reſt, I refer the Reader to the Map annexed, believing it to be very
true, as having been made upon the places themſelves.</p>
            <p>The Emperour at preſent keeps his Court in the City of <hi>Yeddo,</hi> in
regard the Air is there more temperate, and the Heats not ſo violent;
but when he has a Son that is arriv'd to the Age of fifteen years, he
ſends him to <hi>Surunga,</hi> there to reſide, till the death of his Father makes
him way to the Throne.</p>
            <p>Since <hi>Yeddo</hi> has been made choice of for the Seat of the Empire, it
has ſo greatly enlarg'd it ſelf from day to day, that it is at preſent three
Leagues in length, and three in breadth, very populous, and the Houſes
ſtanding very cloſe together. When the Emperour rides through the
City, or that there is any publick ſhew to be ſeen, it is impoſſible to get
by the crowd of the people, though the Women are not permitted to be
of the number. The Emperours Palace is cover'd with Plates of Gold,
to which the Palaces of the Lords are every way correſpondent in Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence;
ſo that afar off the City affords the richeſt and moſt magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Proſpect that was ever beheld: Though it be not ſo beautiful
within, by reaſon that the ordinary Houſes are built only of Wood.
The Great <hi>Dairy</hi> keeps his reſidence at <hi>Meaco,</hi> which is alſo a very large
City, containing above a hundred thouſand Houſes; it was formerly
the capital Seat of the Empire, at what time the <hi>Dairy</hi>'s were laid aſide.
So ſoon as he is Crown'd by the <hi>Bonzes,</hi> who are the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Lawyers,</hi>
he is then no more to expoſe himſelf to the light of the Moon, nor to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103159:69"/>
ſhave his Head, or cut his Nails. The Natives report, that the Empire
of <hi>Japon</hi> was formerly govern'd by a Prince call'd <hi>Dairy,</hi> who had
acquir'd ſo high a reputation for Holineſs, that his Subjects ador'd him
as a God, and that to increaſe the awe and reverence of the people, he
ſuffer'd his Hair and Nails to grow, affirming, that it it was a piece of
Sacriledge to make uſe either of Razor or Sizzars. The Princes
that ſucceeded him, though they had only the name of Kings, have
ſtill preſerv'd the ſame cuſtom, believing that it becomes not their Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
to appear in view of the Moon, as being Sons of the <hi>Sun.</hi> If he
have a Daughter that is ripe for Marriage, the Emperour is oblig'd to
Marry her, and ſhe it is that bears the Title of Empreſs, though ſhe
ſhould happen to have no Children, which is contrary to the Maxims
of all the Eaſtern Monarchs, who give the Title of Queen and Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
only to her, among all the reſt of their Wives, that is firſt brought
to Bed of a Male Succeſſor to the Crown.</p>
            <p>At the end of every ſeven years, the Emperour ſends one of the chief
Princes of his Court to the <hi>Dairy</hi> with a Basket full of Earth, and to
tell him, that all the Lands which the Emperour commands, are at the
<hi>Dairy</hi>'s Devotion; and indeed the Empire belongs to him by right of
Succeſſion, though at preſent he enjoys only the Title, and very large
Revenues, which render him highly conſiderable in the Empire.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Japonners</hi> are Idolaters, and adore the Sun; but though they have
a great number of Temples and different Idols, yet they are not over
obſtinate in their Devotion, only the Emperour is very ſevere againſt
all other Religions. They never ſtir out of their Native Country to
travel, unleſs it be to <hi>China,</hi> and the Land of <hi>Yeſſo;</hi> and within theſe
few years the Emperour has prohibited his people under extream penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
from having any Commerce with Foreigners, the <hi>Chineſes</hi> and
<hi>Hollanders</hi> excepted. He had receiv'd Ambaſſadours at ſeveral times
from ſeveral Princes, but never ſent any of his own to them again.
Nevertheleſs it is affirm'd, that ſeveral Lords of theſe Iſlands newly
converted to the Faith, in the year 1585, ſent their Children to <hi>Rome,</hi>
to render their acknowledgments to <hi>Gregory</hi> the Thirteenth; and that
being return'd back in the year 1587, to <hi>Goa,</hi> they were afterwards
receiv'd, and welcom'd again into their own Country with great marks
of joy. The little inclination which they have to Navigation and
Traffick, proceeds in part from the great abundance of all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for Human ſupport, which their own Country produces; and then
in the next place from the jealouſies of the Emperour, who is afraid of
the alterations which new Religions may make in his Government;
for they are very fickle, and eaſily ſeduc'd after Novelties, which has been
the occaſion of many Revolts, and Civil Wars, till <hi>Quabacondon</hi> wreſted
the Empire out of the hands of the <hi>Dairy;</hi> and reunited all the Provinces.
They are ſo fiery and revengeful, that upon the leaſt affront given them,
if they cannot have an opportunity of a preſent revenge, they will rip
up their own Bellies, and kill themſelves. I was told a Story to confirm
this. Two young Lords that ſerv'd the Emperour met in the
Palace, and joſtl'd one the other by accident; the moſt furious of the
two was immediately for drawing his Sword. The other told him, the
place was not convenient, that he was going to wait; but that if he
would ſtay for him in ſuch a place, he would give him ſatisfaction.
Accordingly the party that thought himſelf affronted went and ſtay'd, but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103159:70"/>
his impatience was ſuch, that after he had ſtay'd a while, not finding
the other to come, he ripp'd up his own Bowels for very vexation.
Upon which the people crowding about him, ask'd him the reaſon of
his killing himſelf; to which they could draw no other anſwer but this,
<hi>A cowardly Raskal has affronted me.</hi> By and by the other comes, makes
way through the throng, and ſurpriz'd with what he beheld; <hi>Poor
Creature,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>thou need'st not have doubted my being as good as my word,
this Dagger ſhall aſſure thee of it:</hi> And ſo ſaying, he kill'd himſelf upon
the place, and fell by the others ſide.</p>
            <p>There is no Nation under Heaven that fears Death leſs than this, or
that is more enclin'd to cruelty. If any Prince or great Lord makes a
Feaſt for his Friends, at the end of the Feaſt he calls his principal Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
and asks 'em, if there be any that has ſo much love for him as to
kill himſelf before the Gueſts for his ſake. Preſently there ariſes a
diſpute among them who ſhall have the Honour; and who ever the
Prince is pleas'd to name, rips up his Belly with a <hi>Cric,</hi> which is a kind
of Dagger, the poynt whereof is Poyſon'd. This cuſtom is alſo
practis'd upon the Death of their Maſters, or when they lay the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of any Palace; for they are ſo ſuperſtitious as to believe, that
theſe Victims are neceſſary to render both the Owners of the Building,
and the Habitation fortunate.</p>
            <p>They puniſh all manner of Theft with Death. 'Tis alſo a capital
Crime among them to play for Money. Adultery is only puniſh'd in
the Women: But Coynage of falſe Money, ſetting Houſes on Fire,
Deflowring and Raviſhing of Virgins, are not only puniſh'd in the perſons
of the Criminals, but alſo of thoſe who are next of kin to them. The
Women live retir'd, and are very faithful to their Husbands. The
Emperour having put to Death one of the Lords of his Court, out of
hopes to enjoy his Wife; ſhe fearing violence, beſought the Emperour
to give her time to conſider, which was granted for ſome few days.
At the end whereof ſhe ſhut her ſelf up in a Room with her Children;
and after ſhe had delivered a Paper to one of her Servants to carry to the
Emperour, ſhe ſet the Chamber a Fire, and burnt both her ſelf and her
Children. The Emperour met with nothing elſe in the Paper but
reproaches of his Tyranny, and atteſtations of joy from the Lady, that
ſhe had the opportunity to Sacrifice her ſelf to the memory of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
Several other ſtories I have heard, which make me believe,
that this Nation is not uncapable of doing actions worthy a <hi>Roman</hi>
Vertue.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Portugals</hi> were the firſt people of <hi>Europe</hi> that diſcover'd the Iſlands
of <hi>Japon.</hi> They were thrown upon the Coaſt by a violent Storm, in
the year 1542, and underſtanding that there was great ſtore of Gold
and Silver in the Country, they return'd with a reſolution to ſettle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
The firſt place where they thought to fix was neer <hi>Surunga,</hi> a
City which ſtands about four Leagues from the Sea: But becauſe there
is but one Road, and that not very ſecure neither for Shipping, they
remain'd there not above five years. At length they took poſſeſſion of
a little forſaken Iſland call'd <hi>Kiſma,</hi> which they peopl'd afterward's;
but ſince the laſt Perſecution of the Chriſtians, the <hi>Portugals</hi> were forc'd
to abandon it, having no more Commerce with the <hi>Japonners.</hi> How the
<hi>Hollanders</hi> came to erect their Factories there, I ſhall tell the Reader in
another part of this Relation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:103159:70"/>
Seven years after the firſt coming of the <hi>Portugals</hi> to <hi>Japon,</hi> St. <hi>Francis
Xavier</hi> made a Voyage thither to Preach the Goſpel. The firſt place where
he Landed was the Iſland of <hi>Niphon,</hi> where he ſtay'd two years and ſome
Months, and travel'd ſeveral parts of theſe Iſlands; but his principal
deſign being to go to <hi>China,</hi> he took ſhipping accordingly. The Veſſel
was no ſooner out at Sea, but St. <hi>Francis</hi> fell ſick, ſo that the Captain
put him aſhore again in the Iſland of <hi>Sechen,</hi> by others call'd <hi>Haynan,</hi>
belonging to <hi>China,</hi> where in a few days after he dy'd, and never was
in <hi>China,</hi> as ſome have reported and believ'd.</p>
            <p>After his death the Chriſtian Religion ſpread it ſelf very much in
<hi>China,</hi> the people being very docible, and apprehenſive of the inſtructions
which were given them, but the behaviour of the <hi>Portugals</hi> diſpleaſing
the Principal Governours, and thoſe who had moſt Power at Court,
they did them ill Offices to the Emperour, and the <hi>Bonzes</hi> miſliking the
new Religion, and jealous of the effects thereof, were the fomenters of
continual perſecutions againſt the new Converts, pretending they
favour'd the deſigns of the <hi>Portugueſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs the Chriſtian Religion daily got footing, and perhaps the
whole Nation would have embrac'd it, if the covetouſneſs and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Chriſtians themſelves had not been the chief impediment
of their converſion. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> did all they could to lay the fault
upon the <hi>Portugals,</hi> but the truth will eaſily appear by the Letter written
to one <hi>Leonard Campen,</hi> a <hi>Hollander,</hi> wherein it is ſaid, that when the
<hi>Hollanders</hi> were ask'd by the Natives what Religion they were of, they
made this anſwer, <hi>We are no Chriſtians, we are</hi> Hollanders. I do not go
about to blemiſh a whole Nation for the fault of a few, but only to
ſhew what a dangerous thing it is, to make an ill choice of Officers upon
the ſetling of a new Commerce in Regions ſo remote.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Holland Eaſt-India</hi> Company having ſet out a Veſſel for <hi>Batavia,</hi>
put aboard about a dozen young Boys, and as many Girls, taken out of
the Hoſpitals in the Country. Among theſe Boys there was one who
was deſign'd to ſerve in the Kitchin, but Fortune made him an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of one of the greateſt Misfortunes that ever befell our Age.
During the Voyage, the Merchant having obſerv'd him to be a Boy of
a ready wit, and for that reaſon believing that he might one day prove ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to the <hi>Holland</hi> Company, caus'd him to be taught to write and
read; wherein he improv'd ſo well in a ſhort time, that being come to
<hi>Batavia,</hi> he was thought capable of a higher Employment. The Veſſel
being arriv'd, the General and his Council reſolv'd to ſend the ſame Veſſel
to <hi>Japon,</hi> with ſome part of the Lading which was brought from <hi>Europe.</hi>
Thereupon the Merchant was commanded upon this Voyage, and the
under Accomptant happening in the mean time to dye, this Boy was by
him advanc'd to the place, and by the Merchant carefully inſtructed in
the knowledge of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade.</p>
            <p>The Veſſel being arriv'd at Firanda, the new under Accomptant
believing no place more proper for him them that to raiſe his fortune,
reſolv'd to leave his Benefactor, and therefore when the Ship was to
return, he hid himſelf out of the way, till he knew the Ship to be far
enough on word on her Voyage, and by that means becoming a Member
of the Factory, he grew ſo perfect in the Language of the Natives,
and ſo uſeful to the Company, that do length. He came to be Preſident
of the Factory; the Authority of which Employment ſo puff'd him
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103159:71"/>
up, that he was not only for continuing and upholding the Commerce
of his own, but excluding all other Nations. Now, as I have already
obſerv'd, the <hi>Portugals</hi> were the firſt Traders, and the firſt that propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
the Chriſtian Religion in thoſe parts; therefore it was that the
Chriſtian <hi>Japonners</hi> would not Trade with any but the <hi>Portugals,</hi> as
having known them longer, and finding them more true to their words.
This the Preſident obſerv'd, and made it his buſineſs to render them
obnoxious at Court, and by vertue of his Preſents, engag'd the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of Provinces, and other great Lords, to favour his deſign.</p>
            <p>However, the <hi>Portugals</hi> wanted neither friends nor confederates. And
though they were not in a condition to be ſo liberal as the Preſident, yet
they made aſhift to defend themſelves, and render his under hand
Dealings ineffectual. Thereupon finding that thoſe Tricks would
not take, he had recourſe to the fouleſt of Calumnies; for he counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
a Letter written in the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Language, containing a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of a deſign of the Chriſtian <hi>Japonners</hi> to have made a general In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
and a particular Conſpiracy againſt the perſon of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.
This Letter he carry'd to a Lord of the Country, into whoſe
favour and confidence he had wrought himſelf, who preſently thought
it to be his duty to give intelligence of ſo important a deſign to the
Court.</p>
            <p>The Preſident inform'd him by what accident the Letter came to his
hands, and gave an account of ſuch circumſtances, as made his Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
look with a probable countenance, relating, how that the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
had taken a <hi>Portugal</hi> Veſſel returning from <hi>Japon</hi> to <hi>Goa,</hi> and that
the <hi>Holland</hi> Captain having taken this Letter among other Papers, open'd
it, and perceiving of what conſequence it was, had ſent an Expreſs to
the Preſident to proceed as his prudence, and the affection of the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Company toward the Emperour ſhould guide him. That the <hi>Portugals,</hi>
who were but Subjects to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> had a pernicious Maxim, not to
ſuffer any Religon but their own in any place where they had to do,
and that for their own ends they never ſpar'd either the Life or Liberty
of Man; that they thought it an acceptable Sacrifice to God, to cut the
Throats of thoſe whom they could not convert. And laſtly, that the
<hi>Hollanders</hi> were a people that accorded with all Nations and Religions,
and minded nothing but their Trade.</p>
            <p>The Lord believ'd all theſe fraudulent Calumnies, and ſent a Copy
of the Letter to the Emperour, the ſubſtance whereof was, That the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> in the <hi>Philippine</hi> Iſlands, and the <hi>Portugals</hi> in <hi>Japon,</hi> being in
confederacy with the Chriſtians of the Country, had ſent to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Goa</hi> to ſend by a time prefix'd eight or ten Veſſels, with Men
and Arms, but eſpecially a good number of Officers to command the
Revolters, for that then there would be a numerous Army ready, and
that they ſhould eaſily make themſelves Maſters of <hi>Japon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Portugals</hi> were then under the Dominion of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and
though they would ſuffer no <hi>Spaniard</hi> in their <hi>Indian</hi> Acquiſitions but
the Viceroy, yet ſeveral of the Religious Orders did ſlip into <hi>Japon;</hi>
carried thither by a true and real zeal; yet this zeal, when once indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet,
does as much miſchief as covetouſneſs it ſelf. The Father <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,</hi>
for ſo they call the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> by reaſon that their Church
in <hi>Goa</hi> is dedicated to St. <hi>Paul;</hi> theſe <hi>Jeſuits</hi> I ſay, had made a fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs,
and gain'd great credit among the people, notwhithſtanding
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103159:71"/>
their continual perſecutions, according as the Lords of the Country
were well or ill affected towards them. Their number therefore
encreas'd, and the new Converts had this advantage, that they enrich'd
themſelves by Trading with the <hi>Portugals,</hi> who had made a poſitive
Agreement not to Trade with the <hi>Bonzes.</hi> This provok'd the <hi>Bonzes</hi>
againſt them, and the multitude of the Chriſtians ſo far augmented
the Emperour's jealouſies and fears, that in a ſhort time they produc'd
the effects of open rage and cruelty.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> had converted to the Faith a great Lord of the Kingdom,
who liv'd moſt commonly at <hi>Bugen,</hi> in the Iſland of <hi>Ximo,</hi> a perſon of
great Intereſt and Power in the Iſland. He had four Sons, two of
which liv'd with him, and following his Example, had embrac'd the
Catholick Faith. The Father was Baptiz'd by the name of <hi>Ignatius;</hi>
the eldeſt of the two was call'd <hi>Francis,</hi> and the youngeſt <hi>Charles:</hi> the
two eldeſt Sons were at Court in great favour with the Emperour. The
younger of the two that had embrac'd the Chriſtian Religion, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
himſelf wholly to the ſtudy of the Scripture, and retir'd with
the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> to their Seminary. His Example had wrought with a great
number of young Lords, and as he was eloquent beſides, he was of
great uſe to the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in preaching the Goſpel, and reclaiming the people
from the groſſneſs of their Errors.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Japonners</hi> are naturally endow'd with a noble mind, and great
inclination to Learning; ſo that there is nothing wanting in that Nation
but able Teachers. Not but that they have Doctors of their own: the
<hi>Dairy</hi>'s Court is full of them; where they preſerve the Annals of their
Country, and pretend that Printing and Artillery were in uſe among
them before they were known in <hi>Europe.</hi> From this Court come all
their Books, in regard the perſons that attend upon this Prince apply
themſelves only to their Studies. It is reported, that they learnt all theſe
things by their frequent Commerce with the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> and that they are
alſo originally deſcended from them. And in truth, the greateſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of the Iſland of <hi>Niphon</hi> is call'd <hi>Quanto,</hi> according to the name
of the Sea-Coaſt part of <hi>China,</hi> where lies the greateſt Traffick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Japonners</hi> and <hi>Chineſes.</hi> Moreover, if there be any credit to
be given to the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Hiſtories, they ſay it was but a ſmall part of their
vaſt-Empire, which extended it ſelf from North to South 56 Degrees
of Latitude, from the Frozen Sea to the Equinoctial Line, being boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the Weſt by the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, and extending Eaſtward over all
the Southern <hi>America</hi> to <hi>New Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Father <hi>Thomas Barr,</hi> a <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> has often told me when I was at
<hi>Agra,</hi> a capital City of the <hi>Great Mogul,</hi> where the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> have a very
fair Houſe, that this and ſeveral other young Lords improv'd
themſelves ſo far in ſix or ſeven years, that they were as Learned as their
Maſters themſelves, and that they were more zealous in converting
thoſe of their Nation. Now the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> at that time had no Houſe for
the Inſtruction of Youth and Proſelytes, and therefore they deſir'd this
young Lord to lend them one of his. Thereupon he having four very
fair ones, with great Revenues belonging to them, gave that which
was neareſt to the City to his Converters. A while after, the youngeſt
of his Sons fell ſick, and was carried to this Houſe for the Air's ſake,
where he recover'd by the care of the Fathers, and the Prayers of the
Chriſtians; but his Father did not long enjoy the pleaſure of ſo great
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103159:72"/>
a Cure, which ſeem'd almoſt miraculous; for he dy'd at what time both
his Sons and the Chriſtians ſtood moſt in need of his protection.</p>
            <p>The two eldeſt, who were with the Emperour, underſtanding the
the Death of their Father, came to take poſſeſſion of their Inheritance,
and demanded of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> the Houſe which their Father had given
them, for in <hi>Japon</hi> no Parent can alienate the Eſtate of his Children;
nay, when they come to ſuch an Age, he is oblig'd to put them in
poſſeſſion of their Eſtates, reſerving only ſuch a proportion to himſelf.
The <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> loth to part with ſo fair a convenience, would not quit their
hold, though it were for their own quiet, and to engage the whole
Family to ſtand by them in their time of trouble. This refuſal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd
the two Brethren, and this quarrel between them and the <hi>Jeſuits</hi>
happen'd at the ſame time that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Preſident was labouring to
bring about his deſigns. He h<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d notice of this diſpute, and as he was
a great Impoſtor, he made <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> his buſineſs to enflame the two Brothers,
not only againſt the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> but againſt the <hi>Portugals</hi> in general, giving
them a Copy of the Letter which he had fram'd, as is before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Lords, who were Favourites of the Emperour, joyning
Intereſt of State to their particular Intereſt, made their complaints at
Court, with extraordinary aggravations; urging that there was no
ſecurity for the Eſtates of particular Men, for the quiet of the Empire,
nor the Life of the Prince, unleſs not only all the <hi>Portugals,</hi> but alſo all
the Natives of <hi>Japon,</hi> who had ſuck'd their Errors, were exterminated
out of the Iſland. To make good the reaſons of their Exaſperation they
ſhew'd the Emperour a Copy of the Letter, and put him into ſuch
a fright, as well for his Perſon, as the Empire, that he would admit of
no juſtification on the other ſide.</p>
            <p>Some of his Lords, who were Friends to the <hi>Portugals,</hi> beſought him
to examin the truth of what was alledg'd, before he proceeded to utmoſt
extremities againſt a whole Nation, and againſt his own Subjects.
But he was inexorable, and preſently gave private Orders to certain
Commiſſioners, to go through all the Provinces of the Empire, and
to baniſh not only the <hi>Portugals,</hi> but alſo all the Chriſtian Natives. Now
in regard they had their private confederates, as well in the Court, as
in other places, they had intelligence, in all parts, of the cruel reſolution
tak'n againſt them, though none were more zealous and faithful to
them then the two Lords of <hi>Ximo, Francis</hi> and <hi>Charles.</hi> Thereupon
the Chriſtians met together to conſult for their own ſafety, and their
common preſervation, and ſeeing all attempts to juſtifie themſelves
prove ineffectual, they reſolv'd to ſtand upon their guards, and to dye
in the defence of their Innocency and Religion. The two Lords put
themſelves at the head of the Chriſtians Army, the elder of which had
been a Souldier, and underſtood the Art of War; the younger kept up
their Spirits and Courages by his continual Exhortations.</p>
            <p>The Emperour's Commiſſioners underſtanding that the Chriſtians
were thus embody'd, gave him ſpeedy notice thereof, but ſaid nothing
either of the number of their Forces, or of their deſigns. The <hi>Jeſuits</hi>
and <hi>Auſtin Fryars</hi> at <hi>Goa,</hi> told me, that the Army of the Chriſtians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
of above 40000 Men, beſides thoſe recruits that came up to them
before and after the Battel was fought.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:103159:72"/>
The Emperour not beleiving that the Army was ſo numerous, ſent
againſt them at firſt not above 25 or 30000 Men, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the youngeſt of the two Lords of <hi>Ximo,</hi> that liv'd at
Court. But thoſe Troops were no ſooner upon their March, but
he rais'd new Forces, and ſent another Army after them, conſiſting of
40000 Men, commanded by the young Lord, to whom the <hi>Dutch</hi>
Preſident had ſhew'd the Letter firſt of all.</p>
            <p>The Chriſtians having intelligence of the approach of theſe two
Armies, prepar'd to receive them, chooſing an advantagious place to
intrench themſelves. The firſt Army ſoon appear'd in ſight of the
Chriſtians, who lay ſo encamp'd, that the Imperialiſts could diſcover
no more than one part of them. However, before the Engagement,
the youngeſt of the Chriſtian Brothers advis'd his other Brother to ſend to
the General of the Emperour's Army, who was their Brother likewiſe, to
deſire Peace, and to beſeech him to intercede for them to the Emperour,
and to aſſure him, that they were ready to lay down their Arms, and
throw themſelves at his Feet, and to juſtifie their Innocency. To this
purpoſe a Letter was fram'd and ſent to the General, but the Meſſenger
that carry'd it was nail'd to a Croſs in ſight of the whole Army of the
Chriſtians, and at the ſame time the Enemy came on with great fury to
aſſail them.</p>
            <p>The Fight laſted almoſt three hours with equal advantage; the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the Imperialiſts ſeeking every where for his Brothers, while they
ſtrove to avoid him. The Chriſtians, who knew that all their ſafety
conſiſted in their Victory, and that there was otherwiſe no hope of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
fought with ſo much valour; that the Imperialiſts were forc'd to
give ground. Their General was ſlain upon the place, and at length
the whole Army of the Idolaters was cut in pieces.</p>
            <p>This Victory wrought the Converſion of ſeveral of the Idolaters;
and the Chriſtians, after they had given thanks to God three days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
prepar'd themſelves for a ſecond Combat, not doubting but the
other Army would ſet upon them while they were weary, and weaken'd
by the laſt Battel. But that General more prudent then the former, only
poſted himſelf where the Chriſtians could not come at him, and writ
to the Court the particulars of the Defeat of the firſt Army, upon which
he expected the Emperour's Orders.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, the Army of the Chriſtians daily encreas'd, ſo that
in a few days they were above fifty thouſand ſtrong. The Emperour,
reſolv'd to ſtifle this Revolt in the beginning, ſent Orders through all
his Empire to make new Levies; and all the while the <hi>Dutch</hi> Preſident's
Confederates ceas'd not to aggravate him againſt the Chriſtians, not
ſuffering the other Courtiers to open his Eyes, and prevent ſo unjuſt a
proſecution. The defeat of his Army had put him into ſuch a rage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
that though the Captains of the Chriſtians Army did all they
could to clear themſelves from the falſe accuſations laid upon them, and
to obtain their pardons, there was no poſſibility of being heard.</p>
            <p>The Emperour call'd his Council, where the wiſeſt were of opinion,
that it would prove the beſt way to receive the ſubmiſſions of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
who offer'd to lay down their Arms upon a general pardon, and
the free exerciſe of their Religion. But the Preſident's Cabal carry'd it
beyond this ſober advice, and the Emperour, exaſperated by his Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures,
took the wrong courſe. Thereupon the Council reſolv'd with
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103159:73"/>
all ſpeed to raiſe a vaſt Army, which was to joyn with the other, and
ſo to ruin the Chriſtians all at a blow. The <hi>Dairy</hi> alſo, who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
upon all important affairs, approv'd this Council. Thereupon
the Lords who are oblig'd to furniſh the Emperour with Men, ſtrove
who ſhould bring their Troops and Companies firſt to the Randevouz
appointed, which was neer the place where the ſecond Army lay; ſo
that when both Armies were joyn'd together, there was in the Field a
Body of 150000 Men. The Brother of the General, who was ſlain in
the firſt Battel, commanded under the Emperour, who reſolv'd to go
in perſon.</p>
            <p>But firſt of all he caus'd a Proclamation to be made in his Camp,
whereby he forbad any Quarter to be given to any Chriſtian, unleſs it
were the two Brothers, whom he intended to puniſh openly; and that
they who left the Field before the Chriſtians were baniſh'd, ſhould be put,
they and their Kindred, to the moſt cruel Deaths that could be imagin'd;
but that they ſhould be rewarded that brought the Head of a Chriſtian
to the Emperour. The Copies of this Proclamation were ſcatter'd in
the Army of the Chriſtians, though they did no harm but only encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd
them againſt the Idolaters, ſeeing there was no hope of pardon.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs the youngeſt of the two Brothers offer'd to go and throw
himſelf at the Emperour's Feet, to implore his clemency in the name of
the whole Army; ſaying withall, That he ſhould accompt himſelf happy
to ſuffer Martyrdom to ſhew his Innocency; but they would not ſuffer
him to ſtir. All he could obtain from them, was to write a Letter full
of reſpect, ſubmiſſion, and repentance for what had been already done,
declaring that they were ready to lay down their Arms, if the Emperour
would grant them pardon, and the free Exerciſe of their Religion,
offering with the hazard of their Lives to make out the falſity of all
thoſe things wherewith they had been accus'd.</p>
            <p>This was by an Idolater carry'd to a certain Lord who ſecretly favour'd
the Chriſtians; but the Emperour toar it without reading it, vowing
at the ſame time, that he would never return to his Court 'till the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were all extirpated. The Chriſtian Army underſtanding the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's
reſolution, minded nothing more then their own defence. 'Tis
true, the Ground where they lay was advantagious enough for the
ſmallneſs of their Number, but the Idolaters were three to one; beſides
that the Idolaters of the Country, who favour'd the Chriſtians before,
now declar'd all againſt them ſo ſoon as they ſaw the Imperial Army.
So that now both Armies lying ſo near together, ſeveral hot Skirmiſhes
paſs'd between 'em; and at length it came to a general Battel. At firſt
the Chriſtians overthrew the Idolaters, not able to ſtand before them:
with ſo much vigour did the youngeſt of their Chieftains aſſail them.
He was remarkable for his Habit that day, but more remarkable for his
courage; ſo that the Field was cover'd with the Bodies of the ſlain, fear
and dread poſſeſſing the yielding Enemy. But while the Victor forgot his
Brother's advice, and purſu'd too far from the Body of the Army, he
was encompaſs'd on every ſide, wounded, and being carried away by
the preſs of his Enemies, was at length taken, and lead before the
Emperour. His eldeſt Brother, more experienc'd in War, rally'd and
recall'd thoſe that had follow'd his Brother, and till Night maintain'd
the advantages, which he had got over the Imperialiſts, who were ſtill
ſupply'd with freſh Succours, as neceſſity requir'd. The next day the Fight
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103159:73"/>
was renew'd again by break of day, and with a ſucceſs as honourable,
but more bloody to the Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>The third day the Emperour enrag'd at ſuch a reſiſtance, caus'd them
to be ſet upon in ſeveral places at one time. The General of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
Army rode from Rank to Rank, encouraging the Souldiers both
by his Exhortations, and his Example: but at length having receiv'd
ſeveral wounds, he was overlaid by the multitude of his Enemies that
crouded to his deſtruction. And now the General being loſt, and the
Chriſtians having no perſon to command them, it ceas'd to be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,
and became a Maſſacre. However, reſolving to dye with their
Swords in their hands, they flung themſelves into the thickeſt of their
Enemies, and Sacrific'd themſelves to their own Innocency. Their
Camp was ſoon forc'd, and all the old Men, Women, and Children
put to the Sword, except ſome few that eſcap'd and hid themſelves in
the Mountains, who afterwards made a relation of this bloody Story to
them who rehears'd it to me.</p>
            <p>This was the deplorable end of the Chriſtians, and indeed of the
Chriſtianiſme of <hi>Japon,</hi> which the Preſident procur'd by his impoſtures
and fallacies. And it has been made appear by three exact accompts, that
there has periſh'd, either in Battels or by Tortures, above 60000 Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.
The eldeſt of their Captains ſuffer'd a moſt cruel Martyrdom
for ſeven days, neither could any offer, that the Emperour could make
him for his Brothers and his own Valours ſake, induce him to renounce
the Chriſtian Faith. After that, there was a kind of Inquiſition ſet up
thorough the whole Empire, which laſted for ſeveral years, whereby
thoſe that perſever'd in the Faith, were condemn'd to moſt intolerable
Torments, in ſo much that the Relation which <hi>Van Varen,</hi> a <hi>Hollander,</hi>
whoſe credit it would be a vanity to queſtion in this particular, cannot
be read over without Horrour. In ſixteen years, that is, from 1613
to 1629, the Chriſtians were ſo multiply'd, that there were above
400000; but in the year 1649, the ſame <hi>Hollander</hi> relates, that thoſe
<hi>Japonners</hi> who were brought from thence by the Company's Ships to <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi>
affirm'd, that Chriſtianity was utterly extirpated out of the
Iſland.</p>
            <p>Being at <hi>Ogli,</hi> a large Town upon the faireſt Arm of the <hi>Ganges,</hi> I
met a <hi>Holland</hi> Merchant, who had ſerv'd the Company in <hi>Japon</hi> a long
time and had made ſeveral Voyages. He came thither with two
<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> laden with Bars of Silver and Copper, which he had exchang'd
for Silks, which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> buy at <hi>Bengale.</hi> This Merchant know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I was there, came to viſit me; and I finding him to be a ſincere
honeſt Man, and well verſt in the affairs of <hi>Japan,</hi> eſpecially in
reference to the laſt perſecution of the Chriſtians, grew cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
of his converſe, and invited him often to my Houſe. In our
familiar diſcourſes concerning the ſettlement of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> in the
<hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and of the extraordinary gain which they make by their
Trade there, and paſſing thus from one thing to another, at length I ask'd
him who was the Author and Contriver of a Maſſacre ſo horrid, as
that was reported to be. Whereupon he related to me all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of which I have here made a recital, and many more which I have
forgot or omitted, as being either not pertinent to my ſubject, or elſe
already related by others. He had his information from ſuch of the
Natives that had eſcap'd out of the Battel, and ſeveral of the Idolater
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103159:74"/>
Merchants, in whoſe memories the fact was then freſh: and indeed he
was ſo ingenious in his Story, that I could not find any motive to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
me to miſdoubt the truth of it. For many times he could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
ſhedding tears, and to interrupt his diſcourſe with his ſighs, often
imprecating Heav'ns Vengeance upon the Preſident, and proteſting
he wonder'd the Company employ'd him ſo long. But God reſerv'd
his puniſhment to himſelf. For the deſerts of his crimes always atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him, and provoking judgments and misfortunes upon whatever
Enterprize he took in hand, he miſerably periſh'd in ſight of <hi>Lisbon</hi> in
fair weather. All the men in the Ship were ſav'd; only he returning
to recover a certain Cabinet of Jewels which he had there, the Ship
ſplit, and the <hi>Portugals</hi> had the ſatisfaction to ſee him ſwallow'd up in the
Sea, who had been the occaſion of the Ruin of ſo many of their
Country-men in <hi>Japon;</hi> and immediately they rang their Bells in the
City for joy of his Death.</p>
            <p>In my laſt Voyage to the <hi>Indies</hi> I was at <hi>Bandar-Abaſſi,</hi> where the
<hi>Hollanders</hi> have a Factory. Thither arriv'd two Veſſels from <hi>Japon</hi> to
take in Silks, which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> buy of the <hi>Perſians</hi> to exchange in
<hi>Japon.</hi> The Captain of one of the Ships told me, that during ſeveral
trading Voyages which he had made to that Iſland, the Emperour had
caus'd two Inquiſitions to be made after the Chriſtians; in the firſt of
which the Inquiſitors met with 247, who were all moſt exquiſitely
tormented to Death; in the latter they only found 63, among whom
were ſeventeen Children, twelve Girls and five Boys, of which the
eldeſt were not above thirteen years of Age.</p>
            <p>Among all the perſecutions which the Chriſtians ſuffer'd, there was
none comparable to this for extremity of Torments: For the <hi>Japonners</hi>
are the moſt ingenious in cruelty of any people in the World, and the
moſt conſtant in ſuffering. For there have been Children from ten to
a dozen years old, who for 60 days together have endur'd to have their
Bodies faſten'd to the Croſs, half burnt, half torn in pieces, while
their Executioners forc'd them to eat, on purpoſe to prolong their Lives
in miſery; and yet they would not renounce the Faith which they had
embrac'd. Neither did this barbarous Inquiſition extend only to the
Chriſtians, but to their Kindred and Relations, nay, to their very
Neighbours. For if a Prieſt were taken in any Houſe, all the people
in that Houſe, and the Houſes adjoyning, were hall'd to Execution,
for not having made the diſcovery.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of every year there is a new Inquiſition, at which
time all that can write are requir'd to ſubſcribe, or elſe the chief of the
Family ſubſcribes for all the reſt, that they neither are Chriſtians, nor
are acquainted with any Chriſtians, and that they abominate Chriſtianity
as a Religion dangerous to the State.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Braganza,</hi> being advanc'd to the Crown, that ſudden
change which in one day, and without the leaſt Tumult in <hi>Lisbon,</hi>
wreſted the Crown of <hi>Portugal</hi> from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> wrought the
ſame effect at <hi>Goa.</hi> All the <hi>Portugals</hi> at <hi>Goa</hi> at the ſame time acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
their new Soveraign; the Viceroy who was a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> was ſent
away to <hi>Spain</hi> by the firſt Veſſels that were homeward bound; and <hi>Don
Philip de Maſcarennas,</hi> a <hi>Portugal,</hi> Governour of <hi>Ceylan,</hi> came to <hi>Goa,</hi> and
took upon him the command of Viceroy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:103159:74"/>
So ſoon as he came to the Government, his firſt thoughts were how
to Eſtabliſh the Trade of the <hi>Portugals</hi> in <hi>Japon,</hi> which when they were
expell'd, amounted to three Millions of <hi>Pardo's</hi> yearly, one <hi>Pardo</hi> being
worth twenty ſeven <hi>Sous</hi> of <hi>French</hi> Money. The hopes therefore of
regaining ſo great a loſs, made him toward the end of the year 1642,
take a reſolution to ſend a ſolemn Embaſſy to the Emperour of <hi>Japon,</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
with magnificent Preſents: For which reaſon he made choice of
what was moſt rare, and moſt likely to be acceptable to the Emperour,
and the Grandees of his Court. The moſt coſtly of theſe Preſents was
a piece of <hi>Lignum Aloes,</hi> otherwiſe call'd <hi>Wood of Calambour,</hi> four Foot
in length, and two Foot in Diameter; a larger piece then which the
<hi>Indies</hi> had never ſeen, having coſt 40000 <hi>Parao's.</hi> To this he added a
great quantity of fair Coral Beads of an extraordinary bigneſs. This is
the moſt acceptable Preſent that can be ſent to the Lords of <hi>Japon,</hi> which
they faſten to the Strings wherewith they draw their Pouches together.
With theſe he ſent a great number of Carpets and Hangings of Cloth
of Gold, Silver, and Silk, and ſeveral pieces of Tiſſue of Gold and
Silver. 'Tis ſaid the whole Preſent coſt the City of <hi>Goa</hi> above eight
hundred thouſand <hi>Pardo's,</hi> which amounts to about 86666 <hi>l. 13 s.
4 d.</hi> of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Money. Beſides all this, the two great Ships which
were prepar'd for the Embaſſador, carry'd one of them 50 Peeces of
Canon, and the other 35, both laden with all ſorts of Commodities
which are eſteem'd and priz'd in <hi>Japon,</hi> amounting to about 83333 <hi>l. 6 s.
8 d.</hi> Sterling. The Equipage of the Embaſſador was no leſs ſumptuous.
And becauſe the Viceroy would not be thought to give any occaſion of
offence to the Emperour, he would not ſuffer one <hi>Jeſuit</hi> in the Train,
but only four <hi>Auguſtins</hi> for the Admiral, and four <hi>Jacobins</hi> for the other,
Men of diſcretion and conduct. While I was at <hi>Goa,</hi> in the year 1648,
I met with ſome of theſe Fathers, who gave an exact accompt of the
Embaſſy.</p>
            <p>They made a proſperous Voyage, and arriv'd happily at their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Port. But you muſt underſtand, that when any Ship arrives at
<hi>Japon,</hi> no perſons are permitted to come aſhore, 'till the Governour of
the place have an accompt who they are, that they may give notice
thereof to the Emperour, and know his pleaſure, whether they ſhall be
received or no. In the mean time the Ships rode in a very dangerous
place, at the entry of the Haven, into which there was no ſteering,
without the aſſiſtance of the Native Pilots.</p>
            <p>The Governour of <hi>Nangaſaqui</hi> ſurpriz'd to underſtand that they were
<hi>Portugueſes,</hi> wrote in all haſt to the Emperour. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Preſident
being inform'd of the news, play'd all the pranks he could, us'd all the
contrivances imaginable to fruſtrate the ſucceſs of the Embaſſy, and
to ruine the Veſſels that brought the Embaſſadour and his Preſents.
To which purpoſe he found a way to bribe the Courrier, who was ſent
with the Emperours Orders; ſo that inſtead of twenty days, which
were ſufficient for his journey, he made it above two Months before he
deliver'd his diſpatches. During which time the two Ships had ſuffer'd
very bad weather upon the Coaſts, and endur'd many a ſevere Storm.
At length the Orders came that none ſhould be permitted to Land but
the Embaſſadour, the two Captains, and the two Pilots, to give an
accompt of the ſubject and cauſe of their coming. The Embaſſadour
being Landed, acquainted the Governour that he came to compliment
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103159:75"/>
the Emperour in the behalf of the King his Maſter, and to aſſure him
that they were no longer under the Power of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> That
about a year ſince, a lawful Heir of <hi>Portugal</hi> had recover'd the Diadem
of his Anceſtors which the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had uſurp'd. That this new King
was ſo juſt and generous a Prince, that underſtanding that ſome of his
Subjects had deſerted the Iſland of <hi>Japon,</hi> without paying their Debts,
he had now ſent to make a general ſatisfaction; but chiefly out of that
reſpect which obliges all Soveraigns newly come to the Crown, to give
notice thereof to thoſe Princes, whoſe friendſhip they deſire.</p>
            <p>The Governour inform'd the Emperour of all theſe things; but the
Preſident having as good intelligence by means of his Friends at Court,
alledg'd to the Emperour that they were Rebels, who came from the
utmoſt parts of the Weſt, to bring the News and Example of their
Revolt to <hi>Japon:</hi> That the natural reſtleſneſs of this Nation caus'd fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
diſturbances and revolutions among them. That they were never
long at reſt themſelves, nor would ſuffer others to be at quiet. That
conſidering the experience he had had, he could not be either too cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
for the ſecurity of his perſon, or the tranquillity of his Empire.
Laſtly, that the Emperour and the Empire would be ruin'd paſt reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
if thoſe people were ever admitted to ſet footing therein.</p>
            <p>This Counſel well ſeconded by the reſt of the Cabal, eaſily made an
impreſſion in the Heart of the Prince naturally Barbarous, and an
Enemy to the Chriſtians. Thereupon he ſent an Order to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to invite all the <hi>Whites</hi> aboard, and to treat them for eight days in
the beſt manner he could. At the end of eight days they were order'd
to repair aboard again, and at the ſame time he made a Preſent to the
Embaſſadour, and chief of his Train, conſiſting of ſix great Cabinets,
and ſix Coffers lacker'd with black, with Figures in Relief, intermix'd
with ſpangles of Gold, all the Embelliſhments being of Maſſie Gold.
With them were ſix Cabinets, and ſix Coffers, lacker'd with Red,
Embelliſh'd after the ſame manner with Silver. I ſaw ſome of them
when I was at <hi>Goa,</hi> and I muſt confeſs I never beheld any ſo rare and
beautiful in that kind, which made me admire the ingenious Induſtry
of the Artiſts of <hi>Japon;</hi> Our <hi>European</hi> imitations of their workmanſhip
being no way comparable to them.</p>
            <p>The Embaſſadour having receiv'd his Preſent, had Order to remove
all the Goods in the ſecond Veſſel into the Admiral. He would have
made great Preſents to the Governour, who refus'd them; telling the
Embaſſadour withall, that he had expreſs command to refuſe them, and
to declare to the Embaſſadour, that if he did not make haſt away, he
would ſink his Ship. That the Emperour his Maſter had made a new
prohibition, forbidding all <hi>Portugals</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> to venture near his
Dominions upon any pretence whatſoever; nay, though it were upon
pretence of an Embaſſy, upon pain of being crucifi'd upon the place,
without liberty to ſpeak for themſelves. As for the Debts of the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals,</hi>
he had undertaken to diſcharge them himſelf; only he had ſent
that Preſent to the King his Maſter to thank him for that Embaſſy. The
Embaſſadour had no ſooner remov'd the Goods out of the ſecond Veſſel
into the Admiral, but they ſank her before his face. And not contented
with that affront, the Governour ſent for all the Blacks that were in the
Admiral, and cut off their Heads, pretending they were <hi>Indians,</hi> and
that, as ſuch, they could not be ignorant of the Rigorous prohibitions
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103159:75"/>
which the Emperour had put forth, forbidding all Strangers, except the
<hi>Hollanders,</hi> to ſet footing in <hi>Japon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the <hi>Portugal</hi> Embaſſadour was thus harbarouſly fruſtrated and
diſmiſs'd, he ſent News thereof to the General at <hi>Batavia,</hi> urging him
to execute the deſign which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had upon <hi>Macao;</hi> telling him
alſo, That though there were a probability of a League between the
<hi>Hollander</hi> and the <hi>Portugal</hi> againſt the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> yet that it could be no
harm to ſeize <hi>Macao</hi> beforehand, as they had made themſelves Maſters
of ſeveral places, while the <hi>Portugals</hi> were under the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
The General taking the Preſident's advice, was ready to ſet Sail upon
this enterprize, when a Meſſenger from <hi>Portugal</hi> brought him the News
of the Treaty concluded between <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Holland;</hi> as alſo of the
Navy which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had ſent to <hi>Lisbon</hi> to aid the <hi>Portugals.</hi> At
firſt he made as if it had been a falſe Rumour, and put the Meſſenger in
Priſon; nevertheleſs while he delay'd the departure of the Fleet, he
receiv'd expreſs Orders from his Superiours to Treat the <hi>Portugals</hi> as
Friends and Allies. So that he was conſtrain'd to turn all his Forces
againſt the <hi>Molucca</hi> Iſlands, then in the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Preſident was very ſorry for the laſt News, by reaſon that the
General and he had great deſigns upon the Conqueſt of that place, and
had promis'd the Company by that means to make them abſolute Maſters
of the Trade of <hi>China,</hi> and of all the Eaſt. True it is, that <hi>Macao</hi> is
very advantagiouſly ſeated for thoſe that deſign to be Maſters of thoſe
Seas, eſpecially upon the Coaſts of <hi>Quantung</hi> and <hi>Fockien,</hi> which are
the Provinces, whither are brought down all the Merchandizes of this
Empire. It lies at the Mouth of the Gulph of <hi>Canton,</hi> in a ſmall
<hi>Peninſula</hi> adjoyning to a larger Iſland, and built upon a kind of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory,
on three ſides environ'd with the Sea, which no Ship can
come neer by reaſon of the Flats, unleſs it be on that ſide next the Port,
which is defended by a ſtrong Fortreſs. This City drew from the only
Fair of <hi>Quanchiu</hi> 1300 Cheſts of Silks of all ſorts, every Cheſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
150 pieces, and 2500 Lingots of Gold, not reckoning the raw
Silks, the Gold Wire, and other Merchandizes: whence it may be
eaſily judg'd what advantage the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> made of it; and wherefore
the Preſident deſir'd ſo much to expell them from thence.</p>
            <p>But his Deſigns were diſappointed, not only by the revolution in
<hi>Portugal,</hi> but alſo by the loſs which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſuſtain'd of the Iſland
of <hi>Formoſae,</hi> which the <hi>Chineſes</hi> took from them, following the advice
of a <hi>French</hi> Souldier, whom the Governour of <hi>Tayovan</hi> had refus'd to
diſmiſs after his time was out. For the better underſtanding this
accident, you muſt know that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> being ſetl'd in <hi>Japon,</hi> and
having excluded all other Nations from thence, except the <hi>Chineſes,</hi>
whom the Emperour permitted to return, after that the Maſſacre com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by the <hi>Japonners</hi> in a City of <hi>China,</hi> of which they had a deſire
to make themſelves Maſters, had caus'd a Ceſſation of the Commerce
between the two Kingdoms, and conſtrain'd the Emperour of <hi>China</hi>
to ſet a price upon the Heads of the <hi>Japonners.</hi> Nevertheleſs the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
did all they could to make a new Rupture between the people, or
elſe themſelves to ſeize upon ſome place that lay proper to ruin the Trade
of the <hi>Chineſes</hi> to <hi>Japon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this purpoſe, not daring to attempt upon the <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> they
over-ran the Seas which environ'd the neighbouring Iſlands, and took
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103159:76"/>
the Veſſels of the <hi>Chineſes</hi> which were bound for <hi>Macao,</hi> exerciſing
ſtrange Cruelties upon the people that had eſcap'd into thoſe Iſlands,
after the irruption of the <hi>Tartars</hi> into <hi>China. Coxinga,</hi> the Son of
<hi>Chinchilunge,</hi> that famous Pirate, who ſav'd the remainders of that
ruin'd Empire, then commanded thoſe people, and was become formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
to the <hi>Tartars</hi> themſelves. Who to revenge himſelf upon the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Pirates, undertook the Siege of <hi>Tayovan,</hi> where they uſually
retir'd, and by gaining that place drave them wholly out of <hi>Formoſa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a large Iſland plac'd at the poynt of the <hi>Phillippines,</hi> ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out in length from North to South, and to the Weſt lying oppoſite
to the Provinces of <hi>Fockien,</hi> and <hi>Quantung.</hi> The <hi>Chineſes</hi> call it <hi>Tali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eukieu.</hi>
Since which time, 'tis very probable that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> gave it
the name of <hi>Formoſa,</hi> from its beauty and fertility. They being the
firſt people of <hi>Europe</hi> that diſcover'd it, and inhabited it; and upon one
of its Promontories to the North built the Fort of <hi>Kiling.</hi> The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Inhabitants live almoſt all in the Woods and Mountains, where they
maintain themſelves by hunting the Hart, and wild Boar, whoſe dry'd
Fleſh, Skins, and Horns they ſell to the <hi>Sangleys,</hi> who in exchange
bring them other neceſſaries. The little Iſland of <hi>Tayovan</hi> lent its Name
to the little Fort which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> built, over againſt the great Iſland;
it was very convenient for the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who made great advantage
of the Cattel, Hides, and Horns, both of Harts and Bufalo's, which
they carry'd from thence, and ſold to the <hi>Chineſes</hi> and <hi>Japonners,</hi> who make
great uſe thereof in ſeveral of their Trades and Manufactures. But the
chiefeſt advantage which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> made of this Iſland conſiſted in
this, that it lay in the middle way between <hi>Batavia</hi> and <hi>Japon,</hi> and
ſerv'd as a place of ſecurity for their Ships in bad Seaſons, and to take
in refreſhments. There alſo they laded off ſeveral of the Goods of the
<hi>Chineſes,</hi> which they took by way of Piracy from the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> or which
were brought them by the <hi>Sangleys,</hi> who are the Original Merchants of
the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> ſetled at the <hi>Philippines,</hi> but who drive the greateſt Trade
of that Country, independent from the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coxinga,</hi> though an Idolater and a Pirate, baniſh'd out of his Country,
and provok'd by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> had ſo much humanity as to ſend to the
General at <hi>Batavia</hi> to ſend away Veſſels to fetch away his Men, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
them all without ſuffering them to receive the leaſt injury. He
had his Friends and Favourers in the Emperour of <hi>Japon</hi>'s Court, as
being a declar'd Enemy to the <hi>Tartars,</hi> whoſe neer Neighbourhood the
<hi>Japonners</hi> cannot endure. For ſo quick a Conqueſt of ſo many Lands
and Provinces in ſeven years, as it were only upon ſight of the Enemy,
had very much alarum'd them. He by his Friends acquainted the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
of the acts of Hoſtility, committed by the <hi>Hollanders</hi> againſt
the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Merchants: Adding moreover, that they had made private
propoſitions to league themſelves with the common Enemy; and that
it was one of the Nations of the North, born for the deſolation of other
Countries, and to invade the Peace of Empires. That they had ſetled
themſelves in the Iſlands of the Eaſt only by treachery and violence.
That for ſome years ſince, they had made it their buſineſs to cruiſe the
Seas between <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Japon,</hi> on purpoſe to make themſelves abſolute
Maſters of the Trade, and that if he did not take a ſpeedy courſe, they
would do the ſame miſchief in his Dominions which the <hi>Tartars</hi> had
done in <hi>China.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:103159:76"/>
The Preſident had much ado to divert the Storm, for the moſt potent
Lords at Court, although his Penſioners and Friends, began to open
their Eyes, and in ſome meaſure took <hi>Coxinga</hi>'s part, ſaying, That the
<hi>Chineſes</hi> were unfortunate enough, in being laid waſt by the <hi>Tartars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
without being perſecuted and afflicted by the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> That ſeeing
that after they had been expell'd their Country, they had nothing left
but their Boats, and ſome few Rocks for their places of refuge, it was
a piece of inhumanity to diſturb them in their laſt Sanctuaries, and to
deprive them of their liberty of the Sea, and their Commerce with
<hi>Japon,</hi> from whence thoſe miſerable Exiles had their chiefeſt ſupport.
The <hi>Bonzes,</hi> the Merchants, the vulgar People, all took the <hi>Chineſes</hi>
part. Thereupon the Emperour ſent for the <hi>Dutch</hi> Preſident, and told
him, I underſtand, ſaid he, that thy Company abuſes my Protection,
and that their Veſſels, inſtead of being contented with the Trade which
I have permitted them, preſume to play the Pyrates upon the <hi>Chineſes,</hi>
and to trouble the Seas adjoyning to my Empire. If I hear any more
of theſe complaints, I will cauſe thee and all thy Nation to be Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifi'd.
I know not how the Preſident appeas'd the Emperour's fury;
this I know in general, that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> made a ſecret alliance with
the <hi>Tartars</hi> againſt <hi>Coxinga.</hi> Him the Inhabitants of <hi>Fockien</hi> call'd to
their aſſiſtance, having rais'd an Army of 200000 Men; whereupon
he went to aid them with a very powerful Navy. After ſeveral Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes,
the <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Chineſes</hi> came to a pitch'd Field, where the
Captain of the <hi>Tartars</hi> having plac'd the beſt part of his Cavalry in
Ambuſh, order'd his Men to retreat by degrees, 'till they had drawn
the <hi>Chineſes</hi> into the Ambuſcade; at what time the <hi>Tartars</hi> encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing
them on every ſide, kill'd 80000 upon the place; <hi>Coxinga</hi> with
his Navy not being able to relieve them.</p>
            <p>During this War, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> took their opportunity, and made
themſelves Maſters of the Iſland of <hi>Fiſhers,</hi> between <hi>Formoſa</hi> and the
Coaſt of <hi>Fockien.</hi> In a ſhort while after <hi>Coxinga</hi> dy'd, and <hi>Savia</hi> his
Uncle, the richeſt Merchant of <hi>China,</hi> who out of his own revenue
had disburs'd the expences of the laſt War, grew weary of the charge,
and was deſirous to make Peace with the <hi>Tartars.</hi> Of which one of
the Sons of <hi>Coxinga</hi> being advertiz'd, ſeiz'd upon his Uncles perſon,
and ſhut him up in a cloſe Priſon, where he kill'd himſelf for madneſs.
The <hi>Hollanders</hi> overjoy'd at the Dath of <hi>Savia,</hi> who had always hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
them from the Trade of the Province of <hi>Fockien,</hi> ſent a Navy
againſt his Nephew in favour of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who made War againſt
him all along the Sea-Coaſt. Several Combats happen'd between the
<hi>Juncks</hi> of the <hi>Iſlanders</hi> and the <hi>Holland</hi> Veſſels in view of the <hi>Tartars,</hi>
who ſatisfi'd themſelves with being only Spectators. But all the benefit
which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> reap'd from the advantages which they obtain'd
over the <hi>Iſlanders,</hi> was only to put into the Hands of the <hi>Tartars</hi> the
Cities of <hi>Bemos</hi> aed <hi>Queſmoy,</hi> and all the places thereabouts, which
<hi>Coxinga</hi>'s Party poſſeſs'd before. For notwithſtanding all their kindneſs,
the <hi>Tartars</hi> would not aſſiſt them to retake <hi>Tayovan;</hi> ſo that they only
were content to build certain ſmall Forts in the ſmall Iſlands adjoyning
to <hi>Formoſa:</hi> and ſince my return from the <hi>Indies,</hi> I never could inform
my ſelf of the truth of the iſſue of that Enterprize.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were not content with their ſettlement at <hi>Firmando,</hi>
which was an Iſland both deſert and barren, ſeated upon a Streight,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103159:77"/>
which ſeparates the Point of the Land of <hi>Corea</hi> from <hi>Japon,</hi> a place no
way commodious for their Deſigns of Engroſſing the Trade of <hi>China,</hi>
as being too remote from <hi>Nangiſaqui:</hi> Beſides, that the North and South
Winds are ſo violent at their Seaſons in this Streight, between the two
Coaſts, that it is impoſſible to come near the ſhoar when they blow.
The Preſident therefore having ſuch good luck in the Expulſion of the
<hi>Portugals</hi> out of <hi>Japon,</hi> doubted not but that he might obtain the ſmall
Iſland of <hi>Kiſma,</hi> an Iſland that had been wholly deſerted ever ſince the
Habitations of the people had been deſtroy'd. At firſt he only deſir'd
leave to build a ſmall Tenement for the conveniency of the Factors.
Now between this Iſland and <hi>Nangiſaqui,</hi> there is only a narrow Frith,
not above a Musquet Shot over. Here the Preſident deſir'd the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
that he might make a Bridge of Boats for a more eaſie intercourſe
between the City and the Port. The Governour gain'd by Preſents,
gave him leave to build the Bridge; but ſeeing that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> made an
ill uſe of it, and that they came too frequently and numerouſly into the
City, he built two Forts at both ends of the Bridge, and furniſh'd
them with Souldiers, who were to take notice who paſs'd to and fro.
He alſo publiſh'd an Order, That ſuch <hi>Hollanders</hi> as came by day into
the Town, ſhould return to their Lodgings before night, upon pain
of Death. This Order, and the little conveniency which they had for
Lodging in their own Quarters, very much troubl'd them; ſo that the
Preſident made new Applications at Court, and obtain'd leave to build
a Factory, and Warehouſes for their Goods.</p>
            <p>The Governour thereupon ſent a Surveyor to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> to mark
out the Ground which the Emperour had given them to build upon.
This perſon being largely rewarded, made them good meaſure, and
yet they were not contented; ſo that in the Night-time they had
enlarg'd their Quarters, by removing the firſt marks. The Governour,
being advertiz'd thereof, began to be very angry; but they found means
to appeaſe him with their Preſents: ſo that he eaſily condeſcended to the
ſlight reaſons which they gave him for what they had done. Thus in
a ſhort time they finiſh'd their work, which was without encompaſs'd
with a Wall, much like a Garden Wall, but within contain'd a real
Fort, flanck'd and lin'd according to all the Rules of Art; and which,
the outward Wall being beaten down, not only defended their Bridge,
but commanded the entry into the Haven of <hi>Nangiſaqui.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They took great care not to admit any but <hi>Hollanders,</hi> for fear their
Deſign ſhould be diſcover'd. So that when the whole was finiſh'd, the
Preſident gave advice to the General at <hi>Batavia</hi> what he had done,
deſiring him to ſend him eight Braſs Guns, ſo broken, as to be eaſily
put together in the places where they were broken. He adviz'd him
alſo to put them up in Hogſheads, pack'd up like other Goods; and
inſtead of Mariners, to ſend a good number of Souldiers, habited like
Mariners, for the ſecurity of the Factory. But this Stratagem had not
that ſucceſs which he expected; for about that time the Emperour had
ſent a new Governour to <hi>Nangiſaqui:</hi> So that when the Ships arriv'd at
<hi>Batavia,</hi> the new chang'd Officers, being more vigilant then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
coming to weigh the Bales as they were put aſhore, and finding
certain Hogſheads at the bottom of the hold, which they could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
by reaſon of their weight, they preſently brake them up, and
perceiving there the broken pieces of Canons, carry'd ſome of them
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103159:77"/>
to the Governour, who immediately ſent intelligence thereof to <hi>Yeddo,</hi>
of which the Preſident had as ſuddain notice by his Penſioners. He
having his invention at command, repairs forthwith to the Emperour's
Court, and there tells the Emperour, That he had receiv'd Orders
from his Superiours to preſent him with certain Peeces of Canon, made
according to the neweſt Invention of his Country, the uſe whereof
was ſo convenient, that they were with little difficulty and trouble to
be drawn up, and made uſe of, where others could not poſſibly be brought
to play: and that he thought no Preſent could be more acceptable or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to him, to render him Victorious over his Enemies. Upon
this the Emperour was very well ſatisfi'd, and ſent to the Governour
of <hi>Nangiſaqui</hi> to ſend him thoſe Guns, and withall, not to moleſt the
<hi>Hollanders,</hi> either in their Factory, or in vending their Wares.</p>
            <p>Having ſo fortunately diſengag'd himſelf out of theſe Briers, he lays
another deſign, and ſends to the General at <hi>Batavia,</hi> a perſon of a
turbulent and unquiet Spirit like himſelf, to ſet out two Veſſels, to
make a diſcovery of all the Coaſts of <hi>Japon,</hi> and particularly of thoſe
Coaſts which were next the Gold Mines, and to ſee if they could find
any ſafe Harbour for Ships to ride in, in thoſe tempeſtuous Seas, or any
places proper to fortifie, that they might no longer depend upon the
uncertain humour of the Court of <hi>Japon,</hi> which was as inconſtant as
their Seas. The General provided two Ships, and furniſh'd them with
excellent Pilots, good Souldiers, expert Mariners, and Proviſions for
two years, with all other Neceſſaries and Inſtruments, as well for del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
as building. One of the ſeven of the General's Council was chos'n
Superviſor of the Enterprize. 'Tis ſaid, that thoſe two Veſſels skirted
all along the Coaſt of <hi>Japon,</hi> from the Eaſt to the South, and from the
South to the North, fetching a compaſs about the Iſlands to the 47 <hi>deg.</hi>
of Northern Latitude, and that they diſcover'd one Iſland which they
call'd <hi>The States Iſland,</hi> and afterwards touch'd upon another Land
which they nam'd <hi>The Company's Land,</hi> inhabited by White people,
with long Hair, habited after the <hi>Japon</hi> faſhion, which they found to
be a Continent adjoyning to <hi>Niulhan,</hi> and <hi>Corea;</hi> and that after they
had wander'd a long time upon the Sea, without any other deſign
then to make new Diſcoveries, they paſs'd through the Streights of
<hi>Sanguar,</hi> which ſeparates the Land of <hi>Yeſſo</hi> from <hi>Japon,</hi> and kept along
thoſe Coaſts of <hi>Japon</hi> to the Eaſt, to obſerve the Bays of <hi>Aizu,</hi> and
<hi>Xendai,</hi> where are the Gold Mines. In that part a furious Tempeſt
took them, in ſight of the Mountains, where the Gold Mines lye,
which laſted four days together. The ſecond of theſe Veſſels run full
againſt a Rock, and ſplit her ſelf, with the total loſs of every Mothers
Son in the Veſſel. The Admiral held out a longer time, but coaſting
the Land where the Mountains of <hi>Sataque</hi> appear, the Tempeſt grew
ſo violent, that ſhe alſo brake againſt the Rocks. In this ſecond Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack
only the Admiral, and thirteen perſons more eſcap'd, partly by
the help of the Planks, and partly by Swiming. The <hi>Japonners</hi> upon
the Coaſt preſently ran to view them, and wonder'd to ſee people in
thoſe parts, whoſe Language they did not underſtand. Nevertheleſs,
they entertain'd them civilly enough; but in regard they were Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and that there was a ſtrict prohibition not to receive any Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
among them upon any pretence whatſoever, they were at a great
loſs what to do with 'em. One, wiſer then the reſt, advis'd his
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103159:78"/>
Brethren to carry them to the Emperour, whoſe counſel was follow'd;
and ſo they took their journey toward <hi>Yeddo,</hi> which was above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Leagues off.</p>
            <p>The Emperour, being inform'd of their arrival, order'd that they
ſhould be civilly us'd; and at the end of eight days ſent for them, and
caus'd them to be ask'd, of what Country they were, and what Deſign
brought them into his Seas? The Admiral, who was a perſon of a
ready ingenuity, anſwer'd, That he was a <hi>Hollander,</hi> who all his life
time had ſerv'd his Country as a Souldier, where he had the command
of a thouſand Horſe, and two thouſand Foot, at what time Fortune,
or rather the care of preſerving his Honour, forc'd him from his Native
Soyl. I was, ſaid he, one of the chief Commanders in the Army,
and though I ſay it, my Service had gain'd me a fair reputation.
The Prince, who commanded us, had a great confidence in me, which
made one of his near Relations jealous of me; ſo that he was not only
content to do me all ill Offices with the General, but ſought all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
to pick a quarrel with me. I dare be bold to ſay, that had he not
been ſo nearly related to the Prince, I ſhould not have taken his affronts
ſo long patiently. But at length he provok'd that patience to ſuch a
degree, and ſo deeply and openly affronted me, that I was conſtrain'd
to meet him with my Sword in my hand. His misfortune and mine ſo
order'd it, that I kill'd him at the firſt puſh. My Friends aſſiſted me to
make my eſcape, and kept me hid for ſome days, thinking to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peas'd
the Princes anger; but it continu'd ſo violent, that they advis'd
me to abſent my ſelf for ſome years. Therefore to render my Exile leſs
tedious, and that I might be ſtill doing ſomething for the Service of my
Country, I deſir'd my Friends to furniſh me with two Ships, with a
reſolution to ſeek out and deſtroy all thoſe Pirates that infeſted the <hi>Indian</hi>
Seas. I have been in chace of them for a whole year together; and
ſometimes we met with Tempeſts ſo violent, that drave us we know not
whither our ſelves, my Pilots not being experienc'd in the Eaſtern Seas.
Soon after meeting with another Tempeſt no leſs rude and boyſtrous,
we were forc'd to let our Ships drive as the Winds themſelves were
pleas'd to force them, which at length drove us upon the Coaſts of this
Empire, where we have ſuffer'd Shipwrack, not having ſav'd above
fourteen of four hundred, which I brought along with me. Happy
in ſuch a misfortune, to be caſt upon the Territories of a Prince ſo
potent and generous, that, no queſtion, will have compaſſion upon our
miſeries.</p>
            <p>When the Interpreter had repeated this Relation to the Emperour, the
Prince, and all the Lords of the Court were very much concern'd, and
admir'd both the Courage and Aſpect of the Stranger. The Emperour ſent
him very rich Preſents, and to all thoſe of his Company; and gave
Order, that he ſhould be conducted to <hi>Kiſma,</hi> to the <hi>Holland</hi> Factory,
and that he ſhould be well treated upon the way, during the whole
journey, which was five and twenty or thirty days Travel. There
this famous Champion ſtay'd four Months, in expectation of the Ships
that come every year from <hi>Batavia</hi> to <hi>Japon;</hi> ſo that he had time enough
to make a full Relation of the Lands which he had obſerv'd, and of all
the particulars of the Shipwrack. One day as he was telling how he had
cajoll'd the Emperour, and that the Preſident was applauding the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his wit for inventing ſuch an imaginary piece of Knight-Errantry,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103159:78"/>
a <hi>Japoneſe</hi> Boy that ſerv'd the Preſident, heard all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
without being obſerv'd by his Maſter. Some Months after,
the Preſident had beaten this Boy, which he, as all the <hi>Japoneſes</hi> are
of a fiery and vindicative Nature, reſolving to revenge, went to the
Governour of <hi>Nangiſaqui,</hi> and repeated to him the whole Diſcourſe
between his Maſter and the Admiral. The Governour, finding it to
be a buſineſs of importance, ſends advice thereof to the Court. The
Emperour was ſo enrag'd at the injury and affront put upon him, that
he commanded the Governour to ſtop the Admiral and his Train, and to
ſend him with a good Guard to <hi>Yeddo,</hi> and not to let any Ship enter the
Harbour, 'till he had had a full Examination of the matter.</p>
            <p>This Order was not ſo ſecret, but that the Preſidents Friends had
notice thereof, who preſently gave him intelligence of it ſo ſeaſonably,
that the Admiral was ſent away before the Order came to the Governour.
Eight days after, three <hi>Holland</hi> Veſſels arriv'd at <hi>Kiſma,</hi> to whom the
Governour ſent expreſs command to keep out at Sea, and not to come
aſhore. The Preſident feigning to be ſurpriz'd at this Prohibition, went
to the Governour to know the reaſon, who gave him this Anſwer, The
Emperour, ſaid he, is acquainted with your tricks, you ſhall have no
more kindneſs from me; I have ſent to Court to give notice of the
arrival of your three Ships, and I ſhall follow my Orders when they
come. Upon this the Preſident made no doubt but the Admiral's ſtory
was diſcover'd; and recollecting with himſelf that he had beaten his
<hi>Japoneſe</hi> Boy, and that he was run away from him, he ſoon conjectur'd
at the Author of all the miſchief. In ſhort, the Governour receives his
Orders, the Tenour whereof was, That he ſhould ſend away the three
Veſſels, without permitting them to land either Men or Goods; and
that he ſhould tell the Preſident, That the Emperour was ſatisfi'd that
the Admiral was a Cheat and a Spy, whom he intended to puniſh
ſeverely; and therefore, if he did not ſend for him to <hi>Japon</hi> by the firſt
opportunity of the Winds, he would put to Death all thoſe of his
Nation, and fling their Goods into the Sea.</p>
            <p>Upon the return of three Ships to <hi>Batavia,</hi> there was no ſmall hurly
burly in the Iſland; for by them they underſtood the danger that their
Country-men were in, if they did not ſend back the Admiral. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
an extraordinary Council was call'd, to deliberate upon an affair
of ſo great importance, who were all of one mind, that the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
was to be ſent back, and that it was better for one to ſuffer, then a
whole Nation.</p>
            <p>The Admiral being advertiz'd of this their reſolution, publickly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
againſt the violence and injuſtice they were about to do him;
telling them, that he was born a Subject of the Republick of <hi>Holland,</hi>
who had only the Power of his life and death; that in their Service, he
would expoſe his life to a thouſand hazards, but that he was not oblig'd
to ſacrifice himſelf for the particular Intereſts of a private Trade.
The Miniſters took his part, and made it a caſe in Religion. The
common people mutiny'd againſt the General, and the Tumult
grew to that heat, that the Sea-men were ſent for from aboard their
Ships to diſperſe the multitude. At length, by the interpoſition of
a Miniſter, the buſineſs was brought to a concluſion; who perſwaded
the Admiral by his ſmooth Language, to appeaſe the diſorder of the
people, by ſubmitting to the Reſult of the Council. Thereupon he
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103159:79"/>
promis'd to return to <hi>Japon,</hi> provided they would allow him what he
demanded, not only for his reward, but alſo that which ſhould bear
him out in that ſame new part which he had in his head to act.</p>
            <p>Firſt he demanded two Ships magnificently trim'd, a Train of fifty
choſen Men, every one of which was to have three changes of Habit,
of the richeſt Stuffs that could be had: Moreover 50000 Crowns for
his Voyage, a Cupboard of Gold and Silver Plate, with all Equipage
proportionable, and that thoſe that accompany'd him ſhould reſpect
him, as a perſon of great Quality.</p>
            <p>All this was allow'd him, and the Admiral departed from <hi>Batavia,</hi> and
arriv'd well at <hi>Nangiſaqui.</hi> The Governour ſurpriz'd at the beauty of
the Veſſels, could not believe them to be Merchants, and therefore ſent
to know who they were; but he was more ſurpriz'd when he knew
that it was the Admiral. Forthwith he diſpatch'd a Courrier to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
to give him notice, and to inform him with what magnificence
the Admiral was return'd. The Preſident alſo ſent, that he might have
a favourable reception, and to deſire his Friends to let the Emperour
know, that this was a Perſon of great Quality, whom an Honourable
Action had driven from his Country, and that he no ſooner underſtood
the accuſation that lay againſt him, but that he was return'd with that
Equipage that became him, to juſtifie himſelf.</p>
            <p>'Till the Order came, the Governour, according to cuſtom, caus'd
all the Sails and Rudders of the Ships to be brought to him, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
any perſon to come aſhore. At length the Order came, that
the Admiral and his Attendants ſhould be receiv'd into the City, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with all things neceſſary for their perſons, and that they ſhould be
convoy'd to <hi>Yeddo,</hi> and that in all places where they came, they ſhould
be nobly treated. The Preſident accompany'd the Admiral to aſſiſt
him, as well with his Coun<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ils, as with the favour of his Friends.
Their Entry was very magnificent, and the richneſs of their Habits
brought the people from all parts, as being mainly greedy after No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty,
ſo that the noiſe thereof was ſpread all over the Court: Yet the
Emperour would not admit them to their Audience upon the day which
they deſir'd.</p>
            <p>Two Months were elaps'd, during which time the Admiral kept
open Table, and diſplay'd his daſling Riches to the Eyes of the <hi>Japoneſes,</hi>
and being of a quick and apprehenſive wit, he caus'd himſelf to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
in the Language of the Iſland, and in a ſhort time he began to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
many Words. When the Emperour ſent for him, he clad himſelf
and his Train in a richer Habit then that which they had on when he
made his Entry. At firſt the Emperour ſeem'd to be angry; I underſtand,
ſaid he, that thou art an Impoſtor and a Traytor, that thy Birth is
obſcure, and that thou art come as a ſpy into my Kingdom, and therefore
I am reſolv'd to puniſh thee according to thy merits.</p>
            <p>When the Interpreter had explain'd the Emperour's words, the
Admiral with an undaunted countenance, Sir, ſaid he, a Prince ſo
great as you are, ſhould rather be a comfort and ſupport to the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
then add to their affliction. Fortune, that perſecutes me, has
in nothing been more cruel to me, then in raiſing thoſe Calumnies,
with which ſhe has endeavour'd to blemiſh my reputation with your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.
She might expell me my Country, and caſt me upon unknown
Coaſts at the other end of the World; but ſhe can never inſpire into
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103159:79"/>
me thoughts unworthy of my Birth. This is the ſecond time I have been
within your Dominions, the firſt by occaſion of Shipwrack, the ſecond
to obey your Majeſties commands. The firſt accuſes none but the
Winds. And had I been guilty of what I am accus'd, I ſhould never have
ventur'd my ſelf into your hands ſo far off from your Power. But,
Sir, my Accuſers have one advantage which I have not; they ſpeak
your Language, I underſtand it not, nor how to make you apprehend
the truth of my juſtification. Allow me eight Months to learn the
Speech of your Country, and then, if you will be ſo gratious as to hear
me, I make no doubt but to confound my Accuſers, and to ſatisfie your
Majeſty in all things.</p>
            <p>The Emperour was ſurpriz'd, and mov'd with his Anſwer, but more
eſpecially at his requeſt of eight Months to learn the <hi>Japonick</hi> Language.
I grant it thee, ſaid the Emperour, for it is but juſt that a perſon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd
ſhould have both the Liberty and means to do it. And in the mean
time I will take care that thou be honourably entertain'd in all places
where thou haſt a deſire to reſide.</p>
            <p>The Admiral us'd this Liberty with ſo much prudence, and got ſo
much the love of the Courtiers by his carriage and his liberality, that
by their converſe, he not only learnt the Language, but by vertue
of their good Character, the Emperour would often ſend for him, and
ask him ſeveral Queſtions concerning our <hi>Europe,</hi> in reference to the
Qualities of the Countries, the Manners of the People, the ſeveral
Forms of Government, the Extent of the ſeveral Kingdoms, their
Riches, Strength, and War-like Diſcipline; of all which, the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
gave him ſo handſome an Accompt, that the Prince took great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in his Diſcourſe. And at length he had gain'd ſo much the favour
and confidence of the Emperour, that he utterly laid aſide all the ill
thoughts which he had of him, and condemn'd to Death, as a falſe
Witneſs, and a Traducer, the <hi>Japoneſe</hi> that had accus'd him.</p>
            <p>After ſo fortunate an eſcape, the Admiral thought it but common
prudence to make a fair retreat in the Grandeur of his Reputation, and
thereupon he took leave of the Emperour, who loaded him with Honours
and Preſents. The Courtiers were alſo ſorry for his departure, ſo that
ſome of them accompany'd him back, and took order for his entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which was very magnificent all the way to <hi>Nangiſaqui,</hi> where
he took Shipping a few days after, and return'd to <hi>Batavia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the People throng'd to the Port to ſee him when he Landed. He
told them in few words the ſucceſs of his Voyage. Some applauded
his ingenuity and courage; others extoll'd the Service which he had
done the Company and Nation. The Council receiv'd him alſo with
thanks and praiſes, and gave him all the Gold and Plate which he had
brought back. A while after he departed for <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> where he
was no ſooner arriv'd, but he preſented a Petition to the States General
againſt the <hi>East-India</hi> Company, for ſending him back to <hi>Japon,</hi> and for
reparation of the violence and injury done him. The buſineſs was
long in debate, but at laſt the Company was condemn'd to pay him
great damages, and Intereſt for the ſame.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Preſident: He began now to be weary of being
confin'd to one Factory, though he made up his Pack well enough
where he was. But his Ambition carry'd him farther, and he thought
he had done Service enough to be advanc'd to a higher Dignity. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103159:80"/>
was his preſence ſo neceſſary at <hi>Japon,</hi> where he had ſettl'd the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Trade in as good a condition as it could well be. And in truth,
the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had then almoſt the whole Trade of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi>
They had taken from the <hi>Engliſh, Formoſa, Amboyna,</hi> and <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ooleron,</hi> and
by that means engroſs'd all the Trade of Cloves, Mace, and Nutmegs.
They had taken <hi>Baton</hi> by ſurprize. The Inhabitants of the <hi>Celebes,
Ternate,</hi> and <hi>Tidor,</hi> were become their Vaſſals; and the King of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſar</hi>
having made an Alliance with them, had expell'd the <hi>Portugueſes</hi>
out of his Dominions. By means of their Factories in <hi>Sumatra,</hi> they
had got all the Pepper Trade of the Weſtern Coaſt of that Iſland into
their hands, beſides ſeveral other advantages which they had in ſeveral
other places, where they had encroach'd upon the <hi>Portugals, Spaniards,</hi>
and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> themſelves. The <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company at that time enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
140 Ships, part Men of War, and part Merchant-men, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
with great Guns, Ammunition, and Proviſion of all ſorts, and
in theſe Ships above 6000 Men, part Souldiers, part Mariners. <hi>Bata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
was the Soul of their Conqueſts, made upon the Ruins of the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſes,</hi>
which had they lain all together, would have made a large
Empire, and by which they might have grown infinitely rich, had
not the expences of their Navies and Souldiers eaten out the gains of
their vaſt Trade. One of their wiſeſt Generals told me frequently,
<hi>We have,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>but too many Fortreſſes, we need no more then the</hi> Cape
of Good Hope, <hi>and</hi> Batavia, <hi>Factories well ſettl'd, good Ships, and honeſt
Men to ſerve us.</hi> For in ſhort, their Officers pillage unmercifully, and
cauſe the Commerce and Dominion of their Country men to be deteſted
by the <hi>Indians,</hi> through their <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Cruelty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know my ſelf, that in the year 1664, the Expences of the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
in the <hi>East-Indies</hi> amounted, <hi>communibus annis,</hi> to twelve Millions a year,
not to reckon Shipwracks, decay of Ships, and waſt of Goods, and
yet their Cargo's for <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> have not amounted to above ten
Millions; and ſometimes the Cargo's are ſo mean, that the Receits do
not anſwer the Expences. Nevertheleſs their perſeverance and courage
were worthy of admiration. For what could be more to be admir'd,
then to ſee that a ſmall number of Merchants, aſſembled at firſt upon
the ſingle ſcore of Trade, ſhould afterwards preſume to make War in
Regions ſo far diſtant, aſſail ſo many Princes and Nations, plant ſo
many Colonies, beſiege ſo many Cities and Forts, and laſtly, ſet forth
ſo many Navies at ſuch prodigious Expences, that it would put many
potent Soveraigns to a plunge to do as they did?</p>
            <p>This was the Eſtate of the <hi>Holland Eaſt-India</hi> Company, at what time
the Preſident, the principal Subject of this Relation, was recall'd from
<hi>Japon</hi> to <hi>Batavia,</hi> there to take upon him the Office of <hi>Chief Director.</hi>
He carry'd thither great ſtore of Wealth, and built ſeveral magnificent
Houſes in the City. His Authority alſo was very large; but he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd
it according to his uſual cuſtom, and was hated by all the Officers
of the Company, and the Citizens themſelves. He thought himſelf
ſecure of the Employment of General, but he was deceiv'd in his hopes;
upon which he took pet, and return'd for <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> where he liv'd
quietly for ſome years. At length his turbulent and ambitious Spirit put
him upon new Deſigns, to revenge the injury which he thought he had
receiv'd. To which purpoſe he return'd to the <hi>Indies.</hi> His undertaking
was not ſo proſperous for thoſe that employ'd him, and who merited to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103159:80"/>
have been better ſerv'd. He pillag'd, couzen'd, and caus'd ſeveral
diſorders in their affairs, and at length returning home again, periſh'd
in the River of <hi>Lisbon</hi> with his Money and Jewels, as hath been already
related.</p>

What paſs'd in the Negotiation of the DEPUTIES
Which were ſent to

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Relation which I have undertaken, I ſhall
make a faithful Report of things in ſuch manner as
I ſaw them tranſacted by the Deputies ſent to <hi>Perſia,</hi>
and the <hi>Indies,</hi> as well on the behalf of the King,
as of the <hi>French</hi> Company, for the ſettlement of
Trade.</p>
            <p>The Thirteenth of <hi>July,</hi> 1665. the Sieur <hi>Lalin,</hi>
Gentleman in Extraordinary to the King, and the
Sieur <hi>de la Boulaye,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Anjou,</hi> with the Sieurs <hi>Beber,
Mariage,</hi> and <hi>du Pont,</hi> Deputies of the new <hi>French</hi> Company, for the
ſettling of Trade in <hi>Perſia</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> and took
up their Lodgings at <hi>Zulpha,</hi> being the Suburbs of the ſame City, where
alſo at that time liv'd the Sieur <hi>L'Eſtoile,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Merchant. <hi>Lalin</hi> and
<hi>Boulaye,</hi> without ſaying any thing to the Deputies, deliver'd to <hi>L'Eſtoile</hi>
the Letters which Monſieur <hi>de Lyonne</hi> had written to him; the Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereof was thus. <hi>To Mr.</hi> L'Eſtoile, <hi>firſt</hi> Valet du Chambre <hi>to the
King of</hi> Perſia, <hi>or in his abſence, to Mr.</hi> Logis, <hi>his Son in Law.</hi> Which
was not a little to be admir'd at by the <hi>Franks,</hi> who had ſojourn'd any
time in that Country, to find that Monſier <hi>Boulaye,</hi> who had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in <hi>Perſia,</hi> and ſhould have better underſtood the Cuſtom of the
Court, ſhould be no better able to inſtruct a Secretary of State, then to
let him give <hi>L'Eſtoile</hi> the Title of <hi>Valet du Chambre</hi> to the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:103159:81"/>
who has none to ſerve him in his Chamber but Eunuchs, and never
ſuffers a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to touch his Habits, for fear of being defil'd.</p>
            <p>The purport of the Letters, was to admoniſh <hi>L'Eſtoile</hi> to ſupport;
aſſiſt, and protect the Deputies in the Buſineſs upon which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
had ſent them; and in caſe of loſſes by the way, to furniſh them
with ſuch neceſſaries as they ſhould want.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Perſia</hi> was then three days journey from <hi>Iſpahan;</hi> for
which reaſon a Meſſenger was diſpatch'd with a Letter to the <hi>Nazar,</hi> or
Grand Maſter of the Houſe, and another to the <hi>Mirzateker,</hi> or his
Lieutenant, to know whether his Majeſty would command them to
wait on him there, or whether they ſhould expect his return to <hi>Iſpahan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean while the Deputies could not agree amongſt themſelves:
For the three Merchants <hi>Beber, Mariage,</hi> and <hi>du Pont</hi> affirm'd, that
the two Gentlemen were only intereſted by the by in this Negotiation;
and that having no right to take cognizance of the Affairs of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
they ought not to trouble themſelves any farther, then the King's
Letters directed them, in the affairs of the Company. That the Effect
of the King's Letters was no more, then that two Gentlemen, deſirous
to ſee the Court of <hi>Perſia,</hi> were joyn'd with the Deputies of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
and therefore it belong'd to them only to treat with the Miniſters
of the King of <hi>Perſia.</hi> That the Gentlemen had no more to do then to
deliver the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Letter to the <hi>Perſian</hi> King, and to deſire a
nomination of Commiſſioners to treat with the Deputies. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,
which all the <hi>Franks</hi> in vain endeavour'd to compoſe, came at
length to the <hi>Nazar</hi>'s Ears; who was ſtrangely ſurpriz'd at it, having
then a deſign to procure an Order from the King to remove out of
<hi>Iſpahan</hi> and the Suburbs, all the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of what opinion ſoever, and
place them over againſt <hi>Zulpha.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, the Deputies rais'd new objections and difficulties every
day; which Father <hi>Raphael</hi> of <hi>Mans,</hi> Superiour of the Order of <hi>Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins</hi>
in <hi>Perſia,</hi> employ'd all his credit and induſtry to accommodate.
He wrote them out ſeveral forms of a Letter, which they were to ſend
to the <hi>Nazar;</hi> but thoſe that pleas'd the one Party, did not like the other.
At length Father <hi>Raphael,</hi> weary of ſcribling and altering, amending and
correcting, and all to no purpoſe; told them ſeriouſly, they did ill to
act in ſuch a manner, and to inſiſt upon idle formalities; that the <hi>Perſian</hi>
Style, wherein they ought to write to the <hi>Nazar,</hi> ought to be conciſe
and plain, without ſuperfluities, or impertinencies; and laſtly, that
all their contentions did but redound to the diſadvantage of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
whoſe Intereſts they pretended to manage. After ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts,
Father <hi>Raphael,</hi> at laſt, finiſh'd the Letter to the content of both
Parties, which was tranſcrib'd into the <hi>Perſian</hi> Language; with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the <hi>Mirzateker,</hi> and both were diſpatch'd away. The <hi>Nazar</hi>
having read it, preſently inform'd the King of the <hi>French</hi> Companies
deſign, and of the arrival of the Deputies. His Majeſty commanded
him to let them know that they were welcome, and that in a ſhort
time, he would return to <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> and give them Audience.</p>
            <p>Some few dayes after, the Court return'd to <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> and while the
King ſtopp'd at one of his Houſes near the Gates of the City, the <hi>Nazar</hi>
ſent for Father <hi>Raphael,</hi> to know of him who the <hi>French</hi> Deputies were,
and who had ſent them into <hi>Perſia,</hi> to which the Father gave him the
beſt ſatisfaction he could. For the <hi>Nazar</hi> wonder'd that they were
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103159:82"/>
come into the Kingdom, and ſent, as they ſaid, from ſuch a potent
Prince, and yet that the Governours of <hi>Erivan</hi> and <hi>Tauris</hi> ſhould know
nothing of their paſſage through thoſe Cities. The <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> alſo
was in the ſame Aſtoniſhment; and it gave them reaſon to ſuſpect both
the Quality of their Perſons, and the Reality of their Commiſſion.
For either they were ignorant of the cuſtom of the Country, or elſe
they did ill to travel <hi>incognito,</hi> like ordinary Tradeſmen, and Perſons of
mean condition. But Father <hi>Raphael</hi> having aſſur'd them, that they
were ſent by the King of <hi>France</hi> to ſettle a Company of Trade, and
that he had Letters of Advice thereof out of <hi>Europe,</hi> the <hi>Nazar</hi> bid
Father <hi>Raphael</hi> tell the Deputies they ſhould be in a readineſs, for that
the King would give them Audience in a few days.</p>
            <p>But the former miſunderſtanding, ſtill continuing between the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
and Deputies, Father <hi>Raphael</hi> fearing ſome miſchievous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of it in the preſence of the King, or that they ſhould make ſome
diſpute for priority, the Father repreſented to the <hi>Nazar,</hi> that whereas
the Deptuies were of two Orders, the one of Gentlemen, and the
other of Merchants; therefore to take away all ſuſpition of jealouſie,
it would do well, that His Majeſty would be pleas'd when he admitted
them to their Audience, to permit the Gentlemen their ſeats on the one
ſide, and the Merchants on the other. Which the <hi>Nazar</hi> approv'd, and
the King allow'd of the ſame day.</p>
            <p>The 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> the King being at his Palace of <hi>Scader-Abbas,</hi>
upon the bank of the River, between the Bridge of <hi>Zulpha,</hi>
and the Bridge of <hi>Schiras,</hi> caus'd a preparation of Artificial Fire-works
to be made, which came to above 2000 <hi>l.</hi> and early in the Morning
caus'd notice to be given, that he intended that day to give audience to
the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Deputies. Father <hi>Raphael</hi> alſo had Order to be
ready with the Deputies, to the end, the <hi>Mehemender,</hi> or Maſter of
the Ceremonies, might not be oblig'd to wait. Accordingly that very
day the <hi>Mehemender</hi> came to <hi>L'Eſtoile</hi>'s Houſe, and from thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
the Deputies, with all their Train, and the reſt of the Franks
then reſident in thoſe parts all mounted on Horſe-back, with a march ſo
ſlow and grave, and for the advantage of the ſight ſo far about, that it
was almoſt Night before they arriv'd at <hi>Scader-Abbas;</hi> at what time the
<hi>Mehemender</hi> enter'd the Palace alone, leaving the Merchants at the
Door. In the mean while, the Merchants believing that Father <hi>Raphael</hi>
did not favour them ſo much as the Gentlemen, cry'd out aloud, that
they would have an Interpreter alſo for themſelves, or elſe would go no
farther. Father <hi>Raphael,</hi> who acted only by the <hi>Nazar</hi>'s Order, and
for the advantage of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, told them, that whither they
went any farther or no it was all one to him: that for his part he was
not there as an Interpreter, either for the one or the other, but only in
obedience to the King's commands.</p>
            <p>In the mid'ſt of this debate the <hi>Mehemender</hi> return'd to carry the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
to their Audience; five hundred Musketeers being rank'd in order
upon the bank of the River, to give them a Volley as they paſs'd along.
The <hi>Mehemender</hi>'s march at firſt was ſlow and grave, but approaching the
place where the King was, and from whence he had a view of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties,
he caus'd them to double their pace to the foot of the Steps,
where the Lackeys took off their Shooes; and from thence they proceeded
into the Hall of Audience, where the <hi>Kans,</hi> and other great Lords were
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103159:82"/>
ſitting. Upon each ſide ſtood the Youth of Quality, ſumptuouſly clad
in Tiſſue of Gold and Silver, their Cloaks and Mantles being lin'd
with Martins, Sables, and other rich Furs. The Deputies being come
into the King's preſence, the <hi>Mehemender</hi> caus'd them to kneel, and
bow their Heads to the Ground three times: That done, he
caus'd them to riſe, and lead up <hi>Lalin</hi> by the hand alone, as being the
perſon who had in charge the preſenting of the Letter to the King.
After him follow'd <hi>Boulaye,</hi> and the reſt of the Deputies, and thus they
mounted up to the place where ſate the <hi>Athemadoulet,</hi> and the <hi>Nazar.</hi> The
King was ſeated upon a Scaffold ſomewhat higher then the reſt, encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas'd
with 150 young Gentlemen magnificently clad, to whom the
<hi>Sieur Lalin,</hi> at the head of the Deputies, made his compliments in
<hi>French,</hi> and then humbly preſented the Kings Letter, ſeal'd with a flat
Seal upon a flying <hi>Label,</hi> enclos'd in an Embroider'd Box, with the
Arms of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Navar,</hi> in relief, upon the Lid. Father <hi>Raphael</hi>
explain'd to the King the effect of <hi>Lalin</hi>'s Speech. After which the
King gave a little bow with his Head, and at the ſame time gave a ſign
to the Maſter of the Ceremonies to carry them back to their places.
Being come to the bottom of the Hall, where the Officers had Order to
ſeparate the Gentlemen from the Merchants, the Officers by miſtake put
<hi>Boulaye</hi> with two of the Merchants, and <hi>Mariage</hi> one of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
with <hi>Lalin,</hi> which made <hi>Boulaye</hi> cry out aloud in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<hi>Menbeg-Zaddè,</hi> I am a Gentlemen; but the thing being done, and
the King being preſent, there was no help. Then the <hi>Perſian</hi> Muſick
began to play for a quarter of an Hour; which having given over,
the Maſter of the Ceremonies came again, and carried up Father <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael,</hi>
and the two Gentlemen, as he ſuppos'd, of which <hi>Mariage</hi> by
the forementioned miſtake happen'd to be one, again to the King: at
what time <hi>Lalin</hi> with a comely grace made his Harangue, and ſet forth
the occaſion of his Deputation to His Majeſty, of which His Majeſty
teſtifi'd his good liking by a nod of his Head. For <hi>Lalin</hi> had a handſom
preſence, and ſpake with an acceptable Tone, and his magnificent
Habit very much added to the comely Air of his Perſon. The Speech
was expounded by Father <hi>Raphael;</hi> which when he had done, the King
ask'd the Deputies ſeveral Queſtions, and then with his hand made them
a ſign to retire to their places, beck'ning at the ſame time to Father <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael</hi>
to ſtay; and cauſing him to come near him, more particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
himſelf of the Power of the King of <hi>France,</hi> the Extent of his
Dominions, his Military Diſcipline, and his Councils: of all which
the Father gave him the beſt accompt he could, and then with the King's
leave, retir'd to his place. This Scene being over, a Flagon of Gold,
and a Glaſs were ſent to the Deputies, attended with a ſhort Banquet of
Fruits, and other ſorts of Food; the Inſtrumental and Vocal Muſick
playing all the while. Which being over, the King again ſent for
<hi>Lalin, Mariage,</hi> and Father <hi>Raphael,</hi> and after a ſhort Diſcourſe, having
diſmiſs'd all but father <hi>Raphael,</hi> he fell into a diſpute with him touching
the Unity of the Divine Nature, the neceſſity of one Prophet, and
how <hi>Mahomet</hi> was the Seal and Crown of all Prophets. He ſeem'd to
admire that the <hi>Franks,</hi> who had the Reputation of being People of Wit
and Diſcretion, could think <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be a God: to all which parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
the Father endeavour'd to give the King the beſt ſatisfaction he
could. But then, Father <hi>Raphael</hi> being deſirous that the three Deputies
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103159:83"/>
ſhould partake of the King's favour as the other two had done. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the King ſent for the other three Deputies, and having diſcours'd
a while with <hi>Boulaye,</hi> while Father <hi>Raphael</hi> interpreted between them,
in a ſhort while he diſmiſs'd them all again, but Father <hi>Raphael,</hi> with
whom he enter'd into a more jocular Diſcourſe then the former, of the
Colours, Black and White, and of the Beauty of the <hi>French</hi> Women,
the King confeſſing that naturally he did not love Brown Women, the
White complection being more agreeable to him, as being that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
which alone compos'd the Beauty of Women. The Father
modeſtly made his anſwer, that Beauty conſiſted only in fancy; for
that the <hi>Perſians</hi> lov'd thick and full Eyebrows, which were not at all
eſteem'd in <hi>France.</hi> Then the King caſting his Eyes upon the Box
wherein the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Letter lay, he took out the Letter, and
obſerving it to be a ſmall piece of Parchment, and not ſuch a one as he
had receiv'd from ſeveral Princes and Potentates of <hi>Europe,</hi> nor indeed
like thoſe which the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> had brought him formerly from the King
of <hi>France</hi> himſelf, in a fair piece of Parchment, with a large Seal deep
cut, he gave evident Demonſtrations of his contempt of it, and was
about to have thrown it away. Father <hi>Raphael</hi> perceiv'd him to be out
of humour, to whom the King in purſuance of his diſlike, ſaid, <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael,</hi>
I never receive open Letters without a Seal, take it, and let me
ſee it no more, for I do not believe it comes from ſo great a King as the
King of <hi>France,</hi> and at the ſame time made him a ſign to retire. He
durſt do no otherwiſe then take the Letter, and ſo returning to his place,
he told both <hi>Lalin</hi> and <hi>Mariage</hi> what had paſs'd in his Diſcourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and the King. Two hours, after that, were ſpent in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
the <hi>Mummeries</hi> of their common Dancers, a paſtime very
uſual in <hi>Perſia.</hi> Which being over, the King ſent again for <hi>Lalin,
Mariage,</hi> and the Father; and after ſome few Queſtions, to whith they
gave the beſt Anſwers they could, he again diſmiſs'd both the Deputies,
retaining only Father <hi>Raphael</hi> with him. The Father, then taking his
opportunity, told the King, that he had always obſerv'd it to be the
cuſtom of the <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> to cauſe the Letters, which the <hi>European</hi>
Princes ſent His Majeſty, to be interpreted in his preſence. And
therefore, added the Father, I beſeech Your Majeſty to permit me to
give the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Letter to the <hi>Athemadoulet,</hi> to the end, it may
be truly interpreted to him according to uſual cuſtom. Thereupon the
King made a ſign to the Father to give it him, and glad he was to be ſo
rid of it. The Father obſerving the King in a good humour, ſpoke to
him in behalf of the other three Deputies, that he would be pleas'd to
admit them to be ſent for a ſecond time, in regard the others had been
ſent for three times. But the King told him, it was enough for him to
ſpeak to the Gentlemen, let his Miniſters talk with the Merchants.
The Father being then diſmiſs'd, he ſent for <hi>Lalin</hi> alone, for whom he
ſhew'd himſelf to have a very great kindneſs and affection; and at the
ſame time commanded the <hi>Nazar</hi> to bring him the next day, together
with Father <hi>Raphael,</hi> and <hi>Lagis</hi> the <hi>Geneveſe,</hi> who was retain'd in his
Service, to Court, for that he intended to be merry with them. Then
he went on, and told <hi>Lalin,</hi> that ſo ſoon as the <hi>French</hi> Ships were arriv'd, he
would ſend an Embaſſadour to the King of <hi>France,</hi> and make a ſtrict
Alliance with him. <hi>Lalin</hi> reply'd, that His Majeſty of <hi>France</hi> deſir'd
nothing more. Why then, reply'd the King, is not my Alliance ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103159:83"/>
but that you muſt go ſeek the Alliance of the Blacks, from
whom you will not draw thoſe advantages, with which you flatter
your ſelves? For you muſt know, that the Deputies kept their affairs
ſo ſecret, that no body knew of them but all the World, the Servants
as well as the Maſters. Not conſidering, that the <hi>Perſians</hi> are good Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians,
and that that Court is never without Spies. Therefore the
King knew, that as ſoon as the Deputies had diſpatch'd at his Court,
they were to depart for the <hi>Indies,</hi> with which Nation he keeps no good
Correſpondence. And for that reaſon, he was not a little offended with
them, though they endeavour'd to perſuade him, that their Errand to
the <hi>Indies</hi> was only for Linnen and Spices.</p>
            <p>The Deputies preſented to the King a very fair <hi>Fuzee,</hi> together with
the Kings Picture, in little, drawn to the Life, which was ſo much the
more eſteem'd, becauſe at the ſame time ſeveral large Cuts had been
brought to <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> and preſented to the King, which perfectly agreed
with the Picture in Oyl, by which the whole Court was convinc'd that
it was the real Portraiture of the King. When theſe Preſents were laid
before the King, he ask'd the Deputies, for which of the Eaſtern Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
the <hi>French</hi> had moſt affection; to whom M. <hi>Lalin</hi> made anſwer,
that certainly for the <hi>Perſian;</hi> thereupon the King return'd, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
they had reaſon; for that the <hi>Perſians</hi> were white, like the <hi>French,</hi>
and that it was impoſſible for them to have any affection for the <hi>Indians</hi>
who were black.</p>
            <p>At length the King, to ſhew the Deputies his higheſt favour, would
have them drink the <hi>HEZARD PICHE,</hi> in a golden Cup, which holds
about a Pint of <hi>Paris.</hi> He order'd the Wine to be the ſame which he
drank himſelf, which was in a Bottle of Chryſtal Glaſs, ſtudded with
Diamonds. <hi>Lalin</hi> drank couragiouſly, and ſo did <hi>Mariage;</hi> but Father
<hi>Raphael</hi> made a fair excuſe, and got off. After midnight the <hi>Zerhaftes,</hi>
or Table-Cloaths of Cloth of Gold were ſpread upon the Floor, and
ſeveral roaſted Viands very hot of the Spice, and Diſhes of Salt Fiſh,
purchas'd from the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, were brought and ſet upon the Cloaths;
together with ſeveral Paſtrie Meats, dry'd Raiſins, Comfits, Almonds,
and Piſtaches, and other provocatives to drink. The repaſt being
ended, ſeveral Buffons were brought in, who Sung and Danc'd after
the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> faſhion, and made a hundred wry Mouths and ugly Faces.
Among the reſt of the Divertiſements, there were two Men introduc'd,
that play'd one againſt another with each a Battoon in his hand, with a
piece of Linnen dipt in Naphta, ty'd to the end of the Stick, which caſt
forth a very clear brightneſs in the dark; at the ſame time four artificial
Whirle-Winds were made to riſe one after another, which were all
hovering in the Air at once, and in a continual Agitation.</p>
            <p>Three Hours after Midnight the Maſters of the Ceremonies came to
raiſe the Deputies to take leave of the King; and ſo leading them to
the lower end of the Hall, after a profound reverence, they retir'd, not
one perſon beſide ſtirring out of his place, to the end they might have
time to take their Shoes without confuſion. When they were gone, the
King diſmiſs'd the Court, and then it is that the croud is ſo great, that
not one in twenty but loſes their own, and gets whoſe-ever Shoes he
can lay his hands on.</p>
            <p>The Deputies and Father <hi>Raphael</hi> being upon their return home, by
that time they got half way, met an Officer belonging to the <hi>Athemadoulet,</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:103159:84"/>
who told Father <hi>Raphael</hi> that his Maſter expected the <hi>French Begzades</hi>
at his Houſe by Ten a Clock next Morning, to treat them, by his Majeſties
Order.</p>
            <p>Father <hi>Raphael, Lalin,</hi> and <hi>Boulaye,</hi> were punctual to their time, and
no ſooner did the <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> know of their arrival, but he came
down into his Hall of Audience, to receive them, where he had alſo
order'd a very fair Banquet to be ready for their entertainment. There
Father <hi>Raphael</hi> left them, while he went with the <hi>Athemadoulet</hi>'s Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
to Tranſlate the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Letter into the <hi>Perſian</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
which being finiſh'd, and he come again into the Hall, after
ſeveral Civilities paſt on both ſides, the Father and the Deputies return'd
to <hi>Zulpha.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Merchant Deputies offended at the Honour which the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
had receiv'd, would have gone in their Turn; but Father <hi>Raphael</hi>
told them, that it was not the Cuſtom in <hi>Perſia</hi> to viſit the Prime Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,
without being ſent for. In the Evening, Father <hi>Raphael,</hi> and
the <hi>Begzades</hi> received new Orders to attend the King, but the King
ſtirr'd not out that Evening, ſo that their Journey was in vain.</p>
            <p>The Merchants ſtill perceiving the Honours which were done the
Gentlemen, and believing Father <hi>Raphael</hi> to be the cauſe of all, they
began to rail at him, and give him foul Language, and threaten'd to
write into <hi>France</hi> to give an accompt of his behaviour. Father <hi>Raphael</hi>
netled at the Language of the Deputies, told them, that he had done
what in him lay to procure them the ſame Honours, which the others
had receiv'd, though they were ſo little ſenſible of it. That he would
continue his endeavours for the Advancement of their Affairs, though
not for their own ſakes, yet for the ſake of the Company, that had ſent
them. Which anſwer, though it were ſharp enough, and ſhew'd that
the Father was angry, yet he did not forget, that they were his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen;
ſo that he ventur'd to carry them twice to the Prime Miniſter
of his own accord, contrary to the Cuſtom. The firſt time he was
not to be ſpoken with. The ſecond time, he made an Errant to him
with the three Deputies, to preſent him a Copy of the Letter from the
Directors of the Company, in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Language; at which time he
ſhew'd them the Deputies, acquainting him withal that thoſe were
the Perſons with whom he was to treat in point of Trade. To which
the <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> reply'd, that he had no Commiſſion from the King
to meddle with thoſe Deputies, but only, to entertain the <hi>Begzade</hi> that
brought the King's Letter, which he had already done. Thereupon
the Father deſir'd him he would be pleas'd to ſpeak to the King to nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Commiſſioners to treat with them, which the <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
to do. That day in the evening, a Meſſenger was ſent to Father
<hi>Raphael,</hi> to acquaint him, that the King had appointed the <hi>Nazar</hi> to
treat with the Deputies the next day, and to know their demands. Of
which the Father gave the Deputies quick intelligence.</p>
            <p>The next day, being the Firſt of <hi>September,</hi> Father <hi>Raphael</hi> fail'd not
to be with the Deputies very early in the Morning, to bring them to
the <hi>Nazar;</hi> but he was very much ſurpriz'd to ſee, that they would not
go altogether, but ſtill loo'k with an evil Eye one upon another, and
continued their former differences. To the end therefore that he might
ſet things to rights, he went to the <hi>Nazar,</hi> and told him, that he
thought it would be the beſt way for the Merchants Deputies to come
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103159:84"/>
firſt, becauſe that they were the Perſons with whom he was chiefly to
Treat. The <hi>Nazar</hi> anſwer'd, that the King underſtood that they were
all five in the ſame Commiſſion joyntly. To which, when the Father
anſwer'd the ſecond time, that it would be the beſt way to do as he had
propos'd; The <hi>Nazar</hi> with a Surly Countenance, why, What's the
matter now? ſaid he to the Father; Are not you <hi>French-men</hi> aſham'd to
be thus at odds one with another, and to give all the World, nay the
very Foot-boys occaſion to diſcourſe of your Diviſions? What would
they have us think of them and their Commiſſion? Are they ſo little afraid
of offending the King? Or, is their King more indulgent then the King
of <hi>Perſia,</hi> who would never pardon ſuch faults in his Subjects? To this
rebuke the Father made no reply. Only he deſir'd the <hi>Nazar,</hi> that he
might have two Horſe-men to attend the Deputies at <hi>Zulpha,</hi> telling the
<hi>Nazar</hi> not a word of his deſign to bring the Merchants an Hour ſooner
then the Gentlemen. This fell out to the Fathers deſire; For the Father
ſent one of the Horſe-men to <hi>Zulpha,</hi> to the Gentlemen, with order to
drink with them, and not to be over haſty, but to bring them fair and
ſoftly along with him; with the other he made haſt to the Merchant
Deputies, and cauſing them to double their pace, they got betimes to
the <hi>Nazar</hi>'s Houſe, where they were civilly receiv'd. <hi>Dupont</hi> preſented
the <hi>Nazar</hi> with the Deputies Commiſſion, tranſlated into the <hi>Perſian</hi>
Language; after which they fell into a diſcourſe, which laſted above
three quartes of an Hour, concerning the Cuſtoms, Tolls, and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Merchants, and the juſtneſs of the <hi>French</hi> in their Dealing.
They had juſt finiſh'd their Diſcourſe of Trade, when the <hi>Nazar</hi> was
advertiz'd, that the three Gentlemen were arriv'd; who thereupon
deſir'd Father <hi>Raphael</hi> to go and receive them. The Father went and
waited upon them in, neatly chiding them for having ſtay'd ſo long,
and making the <hi>Nazar</hi> wait. Well ſaid he, now you are together, go
into that Cabinet, and write down your demands, and the Articles
of your Commiſſion. The Merchant Deputies, which had now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd
with the <hi>Nazar</hi> what they had to ſay, were well enough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to enter into a General Conference with the Gentlemen. Then
calling for Pen, Ink and Paper, they made a draught of their Demands,
the chief of which were, three Years Immunity from Cuſtoms and
Tolls, to begin from the time of the arrival of our Ships; and that
after that, they ſhould enjoy all the Priviledges and Favours granted to
other Nations. They alſo deſir'd precedence above all other Nations,
when they ſhould be call'd to Court, as they ſuggeſted, that they had
at the Court of the Grand Signior. And laſtly, they requir'd a Houſe
for thoſe that belong'd to the Company, to live in the City.</p>
            <p>Theſe demands were dictated word for word by Father <hi>Raphael,</hi> to the
<hi>Nazars</hi> Secretary, in the Name of all the five Gentlemen; and becauſe
the <hi>Nazar</hi>'s Secretary knew not how to pronounce them, the Father
undertook to write them in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Character; which being done,
and the writing read in the hearing of the Deputies, the <hi>Nazar</hi> took
the Paper to preſent to the King.</p>
            <p>Thus after a fair Banquet, accompany'd with Muſic, both Vocal
and Inſtrumental, the Deputies were diſmiſs'd by the <hi>Nazar,</hi> who bid
them rely upon his care; for that he would do them all the Favour that
lay in his pow'r, and give them his Majeſties Anſwer in a ſhort time.
The Deputies very well ſatisfy'd with the <hi>Nazar</hi>'s reception, ſent him
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103159:85"/>
afterwards a Preſent, which was a Shame both to the Nation and the
Company, that pretended to ſuch great and high things, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to ſix and opinion of their Wealth and Grandeur among Strangers.
For they ſent him only a <hi>Tin Cup</hi> Enamel'd, and eight little Caſes of
Perſpectives, or Looking-Glaſſes, the whole not amounting to above
40 Crowns. They alſo made much ſuch another Preſent, but meaner,
to the <hi>Mirzateker,</hi> conſiſting of about a Dozen Pair of Gilt Sciſſars
for Women. We muſt ſpeak the Truth: For they were not a little
ſaught at for their ridiculous Preſents, which were the Scorn and
Contempt of thoſe that receiv'd them, when the Deputies were
gone.</p>
            <p>To Father <hi>Raphael</hi> they preſented a Purſe, with 40 <hi>Tomans,</hi> or Six
Hundred Crowns in it, believing that he would never accept of it;
and indeed he refus'd it with ſcorn; not a little angry with them, that
they ſhould have ſuch mean thoughts of him, as to believe him
Mercenary.</p>
            <p>Two days after, the <hi>Nazar</hi> gave notice to the Father, that the King
had granted the <hi>French</hi> their Demands; and had order'd every one of
them a <hi>Calaat,</hi> or a Veſt-Royal, and in reſpect of Superiority, a Horſe
for Monſieur <hi>Lalin.</hi> That the Kings Anſwer and the <hi>Grant</hi> were both
ready for the Directors of the Company, according to their deſire.</p>
            <p>The King was then onward upon a journey to <hi>Mazandran,</hi> three
days Travel from <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> at one of his Palaces, call'd <hi>Tajabat.</hi> A
Pleaſant Situation, in the mid'ſt of a great Valley, ſhaded with Trees,
and full of Villages.</p>
            <p>The Ninth of <hi>October,</hi> came a Letter from the <hi>Nazar,</hi> to Father <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael,</hi>
ſignifying the King's Pleaſure, that both he and the Deputies
ſhould repair to <hi>Tajabat</hi> with all ſpeed. Thereupon the Father and they
made ſuch haſt, that in leſs than three days they got to <hi>Tajabat,</hi> where
the <hi>Nazar</hi> order'd them to lye in the Houſe of an <hi>Armenian</hi> Renegado.
The King ſent them immediately eight or ten bottles of Wine, with
four Gold Diſhes, full of lovely Fruits, and Tapiſtries for their
Dining Room. But theſe Preſents occaſion'd new Quarrels; For there
being two Factions, and both living apart, there was a great diſpute
who ſhould have this preſent. Father <hi>Raphael,</hi> having done all
that poſſible he could to reconcile the buſineſs, and not being able to
perſuade them, in a juſt Paſſion, bid them take their Swords and Piſtols,
and go and decide the Quarrel in the Field. Till now, ſaid he, I have
done all I could to conceal your deteſtable diviſions from the Court,
which nevertheleſs, is but too well acquainted therewith: Is it your
deſign to publiſh your own Ignominy, and to make not only your ſelves,
but the whole Nation of the <hi>French</hi> ridiculous to the <hi>Perſians?</hi> At length
they were ſo far reconcil'd, that one Room ſerv'd them to Feed, and
conſequently the ſame Furniture. For the Father's reproofs had put
them a little out of Countenance.</p>
            <p>The Seventeenth of <hi>October,</hi> the <hi>Mehemander</hi> came to the Deputies
Lodgings, and brought five Royal Veſts; The Richeſt, which was of
Tiſſue of Gold, was for Monſieur <hi>Lalin;</hi> the next, not altogether ſo
rich, for Monſieur <hi>Boulaye;</hi> and the other three of a lower price, for
the Merchants; The value of the whole might amount to 600 Crowns,
for which the <hi>French</hi> Deputies moſt generouſly gave the Officers that
brought them 25 or 30 Crowns, as a Gratuity. The Officers of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103159:85"/>
Stable alſo brought two Horſes for the Gentlemen, for which they
receiv'd ſix Crowns in Gold, as a reward. I confeſs, I ſhould have been
aſham'd of ſuch a poorneſs of Spirit, at ſuch a time as that.</p>
            <p>At length alſo the <hi>Ragan</hi> or Patent for the Company was deliver'd
into the Hands of the Deputies, faithfully Tranſlated by Father <hi>Raphael</hi> to
this Effect.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That whereas the Merchants of the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> who are
favour'd by the Favour extreemly Royal, and the Juſtice exceſſively
Royal, being made conſtant in the hope and participation in the
time, have preſented their Petition, which is arriv'd at the Ear
of the Miniſters Commiſſioners for the Court of Grandeur and high
Fortune; Their Intentions and Demands have found the Viſage of
Acceptation, and we have ſtrictly commanded, that the Conſervatours
of Rights, Tolls and Priviledges, acknowledge them for exempt
and priviledg'd, during the ſpace of Three Years; and that there be
nothing demanded upon their Goods and Factories, conformable to
the requeſt of the Deputies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The next day, the <hi>Mehemander Bachi,</hi> came early in the Morning to
attend the Deputies, and bring them with all ſpeed to the Court:
Where being admitted into the Garden, they met the King a Horſe-back,
and all the Court a Foot. The <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> held the King's
Anſwer to the King of <hi>France,</hi> in a Bag of Cloth of Gold, Seal'd with
the Kings Seal upon red <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wax. The Sieur <hi>Lalin</hi> then, and the
reſt of the Deputies were order'd to go neer and Kiſs the Kings Boot,
who kept his Grandeur, without ſpeaking a word. When they had
ſo done, the <hi>Athemadoulet</hi> calling them to him, there, ſaid he, there is
the Anſwer for the <hi>Grand Cha,</hi> that is, for the King of the Kings of
<hi>France.</hi> The Deputies having made their Obeyſances to the King, the
whole Court took Horſe; and the King took the Road of <hi>Cachan;</hi> and
within an Hour, that Campaign, which look'd like a thick peopl'd
City, became as Deſert as the moſt part of <hi>Perſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Deputies, having read over the Patent, began to find many
defects, and <hi>Mariage</hi> would fain have follow'd the Court for amendments,
and would have perſuaded <hi>Lalin</hi> and Father <hi>Raphael</hi> to have gone along
with him. But Father <hi>Raphael</hi> over-perſuaded them to retun firſt to
their Lodgings at <hi>Zulpha,</hi> and there to hear the Patent diſtinctly read
over, and to conſider better of it. When they came to <hi>Zulpha,</hi> and
that they had debated upon the meer Letter of the <hi>Patent,</hi> then they
were worſe mad then they were before. Then there were ſo many
Cavils, ſo many Diſputes, ſo many Exceptions, and ſo many Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
put upon the Words <hi>Conformably</hi> and <hi>Reaſonably,</hi> that they muſt
get a Horſe back immediately. <hi>Boulaye</hi> ſtopp'd this fury for a while; So
that after many Diſputes and Conſultations, it was agreed, that <hi>Mariage,</hi>
as chief of the Negotiation, and <hi>Lalin,</hi> ſhould follow the Court; and
that <hi>Boulaye, Breber,</hi> and <hi>Dupont,</hi> ſhould proceed forward to the <hi>Indies.</hi>
The Sieur <hi>L'Eſtoile,</hi> and all the reſt of the <hi>Franks,</hi> were of opinion,
that <hi>Lalin</hi> ſhould forthwith depart for <hi>France,</hi> with the King's Letter.
But their Counſel was not follow'd, and ſo the Deputies divided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
<hi>Lalin</hi> and <hi>Mariage</hi> to follow the Court, which was then remov'd
as far as <hi>Mazandran:</hi> And the other three to purſue their Journey to
the Eaſt <hi>Indies.</hi> The two former fain would have had Father <hi>Raphael</hi>
have accompany'd them to the Court; but he fairly excus'd himſelf.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103159:86"/>
Neither would <hi>L'Eſtoile</hi> permit his Son, to whom he allow'd 20 <hi>Tomans</hi>
a Year, to return to the Court, chooſing rather to ſend him to <hi>Bander</hi>
with the other three. Whereupon, the Seventeenth of <hi>November,</hi> they
ſet forward upon their Journey.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Du Pont,</hi> without doubt, was the moſt ſolid and judicious of all the
Merchants, but he took it ſo to heart, to ſee the diſ-union among them,
that he fell into a languiſhing Diſeaſe at <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> and dy'd not far from
<hi>Schiras.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for <hi>Lalin</hi> and <hi>Mariage,</hi> they left <hi>Iſpahan</hi> the Fifteenth of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
and arriv'd at Court ſoon after, where they lay a long time neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
their Diviſions ſtill continuing, which made them contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and ruin'd the Affairs of the Company. One
Evening, the <hi>Nazar</hi> ſent them a Flow'r, adviſing them, that as that
Flow'r never chang'd; ſo it became them not to vary in their Reſolutions.
After a long and tedious ſtay, <hi>Mariage</hi> obtain'd ſome few impertinent
Alterations in his Patent; and permiſſion to make Wine at <hi>Schiras,</hi> as
the <hi>Engliſh, Hollanders,</hi> and <hi>Portugueſes</hi> had.</p>
            <p>With theſe Alterations they both leave the Court; and <hi>Mariage</hi>
would certainly have accompany'd <hi>Lalin,</hi> who had an intention to ſee
<hi>Ardevil, Tauris,</hi> and <hi>Kom,</hi> had he not been ſolicited to return to <hi>Zul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,</hi>
by a Young <hi>Dalilah,</hi> that had ſmitten his heart. For by the means
of an old Woman, the Mother of one of his Lacqueys, he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd
a young <hi>Armenian</hi> Virgin, whom he kept privately to himſelf;
yet not ſo privately, but the noiſe thereof was quickly ſpread all over
<hi>Zulpha.</hi> All the <hi>Armenians</hi> were ſcandaliz'd at it, and ſent to ſeize the
Baud, to puniſh her, by their Laws, as ſhe deſerv'd. <hi>Mariage</hi> adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd
thereof, flew out of his Lodging to her aſſiſtance, and to protect
her from Juſtice. But ſeeing the People in an uproar, and finding the
Stones to flye too thick about his Ears, he was forc'd to mind his own
ſafety, and to ſeek for ſhelter in the next Houſe where he could be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.
But the Buſineſs was not ſo put up, for the <hi>Armenians,</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
to ſee that a Deputy of an Illuſtrious Company, who was come
to the Court of <hi>Perſia</hi> upon ſo ſerious an Affair, ſhould do ſo much wrong
to his Nation, by publickly appearing in ſo ſhameful an Action, and ſo
unworthy of a Perſon in public Employment, that they reſolv'd to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
him all manner of ways. They were reſolv'd, to that end, to have
ſent into <hi>France</hi> an Expreſs, to have Complain'd to the King of his ill
Management and bad Behaviour. But <hi>Mariage</hi> at length reſtor'd the
<hi>Armenian</hi> Girl which he had kept cloſe lock'd up; after which time the
<hi>Armenians</hi> never look'd upon him but with ſcorn and contempt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lalin</hi> being return'd to <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> departed thence the <hi>22th</hi> of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
1666. for <hi>Bander,</hi> with a Reſolution, to Travel into the <hi>Indies.</hi>
But he fell ſick at <hi>Bander,</hi> and thinking to return to <hi>Schiras,</hi> for the
Air's ſake, he dy'd by the way at a Village call'd <hi>Bend-Ali.</hi> A Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
endow'd with noble Qualities, and whoſe Gentile and Generous
behaviour was an honour to his Nation.</p>
            <p>The Thirtieth of the ſame <hi>November, Mariage</hi> alſo left <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> and
departed for <hi>Bander,</hi> with one Father <hi>Mercier,</hi> a <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> whom he
took along with him as his Almoner, and <hi>Lewis L'Eſtoile,</hi> his <hi>Kalmachi,</hi>
or Interpreter: There he ſtay'd four Months for the arrival of the Ships,
but none coming, and the heats encreaſing, he reſolv'd to ſpend the
reſt of the Year at <hi>Schiras.</hi> As for the <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> and young <hi>L' Eſtoile,</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:103159:86"/>
becauſe there was no Converſe but with the people of the Country,
they return'd back to <hi>Iſpahan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Boulaye</hi> and <hi>Beber</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Suratte</hi> the firſt of <hi>April,</hi> 1666. Being
come to the <hi>Bar,</hi> they ſent to Father <hi>Ambroiſe,</hi> chief of the Miſſion of
the <hi>Capuchins,</hi> who preſently attended them with a Sloop, which he
had obtain'd of the Governour, and brought them home to the <hi>Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin</hi>'s
Houſe, where they ſtay'd till they departed for <hi>Agra.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
before was arriv'd there a Merchant of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> who had run him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
out at heels, and of a <hi>Maronite</hi> Chriſtian was become a <hi>Roman</hi>
Catholick, in hopes to patch up his broken Fortune, being in truth a
meer Counterfeit, and a Hypocrite: For theſe <hi>Levantine</hi> Chriſtians
ſeldom change their Religion, but upon ſome motive of Intereſt; and
when they have got a good Sum together, they preſently whip back
again into their own Country, and for a ſmall piece of Money obtain
abſolution of their Patriarch. Thus ſeveral of the Religious <hi>Franks</hi>
that travel out of <hi>Europe</hi> into <hi>Aſia</hi> are often deceiv'd, making a great
noiſe of their Converſion of the <hi>Levantines,</hi> when the Converſion, at
the bottom, is only an outward Converſion, and a meer piece of Gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery.
Among many others that I could relate, I will only mention
one, of a <hi>Franciſcan,</hi> call'd <hi>Paul Stella,</hi> who coming with 400 Crowns,
or thereabouts, in his Pocket, for his ſubſiſtance, a <hi>Maronite</hi> ſmelt him
out, and under the pretence of giving him the Honour of his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to the Catholick Religion, never left him till he had ſuck'd him
dry, and turn'd the Channel of his Money. This <hi>Maronite</hi> Merchant
before mention'd, whoſe Name was <hi>Chelebi,</hi> ſhew'd himſelf very zealous
for the <hi>Capuchins,</hi> and he had reaſon enough; for the <hi>Capuchins</hi> of <hi>Aleppo</hi>
had been very ſerviceable to him, and had help'd him in his Affairs when
they were at the loweſt ebb. They were overjoy'd at his arrival at <hi>Surat,</hi>
and gave it out immediately that it was he that had given them Money
for the building their Houſe and Church. But when I came to look
over my Accompts, I found that the Money that had pay'd for the
Ground and a good ſhare of the building, came out of my Purſe;
Father <hi>Ambroiſe</hi> having promis'd that I ſhould be reimburs'd upon my
return to <hi>Paris.</hi> But I never heard more of my Money, nor indeed did
I ever look after it.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why the <hi>Capuchins</hi> were willing that the <hi>Aleppo</hi> Merchant,
who never had disburs'd a Peny, ſhould own the Expences of their
Houſe and Church, is this; becauſe no <hi>Frangui</hi> Chriſtian is permitted
in the <hi>Indies</hi> to enjoy the propriety of Houſes, or to make any reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of thoſe which they hire, without the leave of the Governour of
the place. Both the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> Companies are only <hi>Leſſees</hi> to
the <hi>Indians;</hi> the <hi>Great Mogul</hi> having ſuffer'd from the Chriſtians in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
places, where under pretence of repairing or adorning certain
Houſes, which they poſſeſs'd by way of propriety, they have ſo well
fortifi'd them, that when the Governours have come to require any
Duties from them, they have made them good ſo long, till they have
forc'd the Governours to yield to their demands.</p>
            <p>So ſoon as the Deputies were landed at <hi>Surat,</hi> they preſently ſpread
abroad a report, that there were ſeven or eight Ships belonging to the
<hi>French</hi> Company that would ſuddainly follow them. The <hi>Aleppo</hi> Merchant
was overjoy'd to hear the News, and was in great hopes, that by the
favour of the <hi>Capuchins,</hi> and the advantage which he had of ſpeaking
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103159:87"/>
ſeveral of the <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Languages, that the greateſt part of the <hi>French</hi>
Merchandize would paſs through his hands. Upon theſe hopes he
made great Treats, and preſented large Preſents to the Deputies, and
maintain'd their Servants at his own Charges. He found the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
to be ſufficiently covetous, but he was ſtill in great expectations,
that his civil Entertainments, and the Preſents which they receiv'd
from him, would oblige them to acknowledge his kindneſs, and that
one day he ſhould find himſelf repay'd by the management of their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
but he was foully miſtaken. For it coſt him above 1500 <hi>Rupies,</hi>
part which he ſpent upon them himſelf at <hi>Surat,</hi> and partly what his
Nephew furniſh'd them withall at <hi>Agra</hi> for their preſent occaſions.</p>
            <p>Three or four days after their arrival at <hi>Surat,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Preſident ſent
to viſit them by ſome of his Council, and would have waited on them
himſelf, but that he lay then ill of the Gout. The <hi>Holland</hi> Commander
did the ſame with his Council, ſhewing all the civilities and kindneſſes
that lay in his power; and a few days after invited them ſolemnly to a
great Feaſt, with as many as they could bring along with them. In
the midſt of their Jollity the King's Health was ſent about, and after
that, the Proſperity of the <hi>French</hi> Company; which oblig'd <hi>Boulaye</hi> to
begin another Health to the happy Progreſs of the <hi>Holland</hi> Company.
But when it came to Mr. <hi>Beber</hi>'s turn to drink it, notwithſtanding all
that <hi>Boulaye,</hi> and the reſt of the Company could ſay to him, they
could not oblige him to pledge it. Nay, he did worſe then this, for
he threw the Glaſs, Wine, and all at his Feet; and when he had ſo
done, he roſe in a heat from the Table, and after a pitiful manner left
the Company, and went home to his Lodging, though without any
attendance. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> were ſo diſcreet as to take little notice of
his folly, but remain'd very merry at the Table with Mr. <hi>Boulaye</hi> till
Midnight. But they could not forbear telling their Friends, that they
wonder'd, in regard there were ſo many diſcreet and ingenious Men in
<hi>France,</hi> that the Company ſhould make choice of ſuch a Fool for the
management of ſuch an important Affair as he was ſent about; and
that they foreſaw he would do the Company no ſmall injury.</p>
            <p>While the Deputies ſtay'd at <hi>Surat,</hi> the Governour of the place, at
the requeſt of Father <hi>Ambroiſe,</hi> entertain'd them, and ſhew'd them all
the reſpect that could be ſhew'd to Strangers. One day that they were
in Diſcourſe together, he told them, that if they would follow his
Counſel, he adviz'd them not to go to Court till their Ships were
arriv'd. But ſeeing that they were reſolv'd to the contrary, he offer'd
them Money, Horſes, and Souldiers, to attend them, with Letters
of Recommendation to ſome of the Grandees of the Court. The <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bander,</hi>
or Provoſt of Merchants, made them the ſame offers that the
Governour had done; all which they refus'd very obſtinately. More
then this, they behav'd themſelves very ill, in reference to the Preſents
which the Governour and the <hi>Cha-Bander</hi> ſent them, for they gave
their Servants that carry'd them not a <hi>Doight,</hi> which is look'd upon as a
very dirty action in the <hi>Indies.</hi> For the <hi>Indians</hi> never give their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
any other Wages, then what they get by carrying Preſents from
their Maſters. And the more they have given them, the more Honour
it is, both for him that receives, and him that ſends the Preſent.</p>
            <p>The Deputies then being reſolv'd for <hi>Agra,</hi> hir'd their Waynes, and
their Oxen to carry their Luggage, and five and twenty Souldiers for
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103159:87"/>
their Convoy. They likewiſe made a great noiſe, of their being
honour'd from ſo Great a King, and ſo Noble a Company. Upon
which ſcore, they ought to have had five or ſix Wains for their Baggage,
every one their <hi>Pallaquin</hi> and a Led-horſe, and every one a Flag with
their Arms or their Cyphers, which is the gentile way of Travelling
in <hi>India,</hi> and as I was always wont to travel. But they took but
five and twenty Souldiers, whereas they ought to have hir'd an hundred
and fifty at the rate they talk'd.</p>
            <p>But inſtead of ſo doing, three Days Journey from <hi>Surat, Beber</hi> began
to quarrel with <hi>Boulaye,</hi> that they had too great a Train at their heels,
for which he blam'd the Adviſe of Father <hi>Ambroiſe</hi> and the Merchant
of <hi>Aleppo:</hi> That for his part he would pay for no more than four
Souldiers, and that if he would not ſend the reſt back, he ſhould pay
them himſelf. Upon which, they agreed to ſend back the ſix Souldiers
which the Governour had order'd to attend them as far as <hi>Brampour;</hi>
upon their diſmiſſment, not giving them ſo much as the Worth of a
Pipe of Tobacco.</p>
            <p>When they came to <hi>Agra,</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Chelebi,</hi> the <hi>Aleppo</hi>
Merchant, fail'd not to wait upon them, and to offer them his ſervice.
There was at that time a <hi>French</hi> Chirurgeon, whoſe Name was <hi>James,</hi>
he ſpake good <hi>Indian,</hi> and was married in the Country to the Daughter
of a <hi>Portugal:</hi> The <hi>Nahab,</hi> the King's Uncle and Grand Vizier, had a
great kindneſs for this Chirurgeon; and by his procurement it was,
that the Deputies had Audience of <hi>Giafer-Kan,</hi> for ſo was the <hi>Nahab</hi>
call'd. They requeſted of him, that by his favour they might preſent
a Letter from their King to the <hi>Great Mogul,</hi> as alſo that they might
be admitted to treat concerning the Settlement of a <hi>French</hi> Trade in the
Countrey. The <hi>Nahab</hi> told them, that he would ſpeak to the King,
and take care that they ſhould be admitted to their Audience in a little
time. With that he order'd them to be conducted to the Lodgings
appointed for them, which they found ready furniſh'd with all neceſſary
proviſion for the Belly; but their Lacqueys and Servants were to cook
it themſelves; for it is not here as it is in <hi>Perſia,</hi> where the Meat is ſent
ready dreſt out of the King's Kitchin to the Embaſſadors Table.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Nahab,</hi> who underſtood that they had brought no Preſents,
neither for him, nor any of the Grandees of the Court, nor for
the King himſelf, was not over haſty to admit them to their Audience.
So that it was above a Month before the Deputies could ſet Eyes upon
the <hi>Nahab</hi> again, though the Chirurgeon, and other <hi>Franguis,</hi> us'd all
their Intereſt in their behalf. Being very weary of this Delay, they
gave it out, that they could ſtay no longer at <hi>Agra,</hi> in regard they
were to be at <hi>Surat</hi> upon the Arrival of the <hi>French</hi> Veſſels. Upon
which falſe Report, the <hi>Nahab</hi> ſent to them for the King their Maſter's
Letter, that he might preſent it to the <hi>Great Mogul</hi> himſelf. Upon this
Demand of their Letter, they were quite blank, not being acquainted
with the manner how the Kings of <hi>India</hi> receive thoſe Letters which
are brought them by Embaſſadors: For they never receive any with
their own hands, but ſuch as come from the <hi>Grand Signior:</hi> All other
Letters, according to the Grandeur of the Kings that ſend them, are
put into the hands of the Grand Officers of the Court, who preſent
them to the King: And the more potent the King is, from whom the
Letter comes, through the fewer hands it paſſes before it is preſented
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103159:88"/>
to the <hi>Great Mogul.</hi> For the preſent State of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> is very
well known in the Court of the <hi>Great Mogul,</hi> and the Difference
between the Soveraigns of both, in reference to their Grandeur and
Puiſſance. Neither is there a Stranger that enters into the Kingdom,
of whom the Governour of the Frontier Province does not give advice
to the <hi>Nahab;</hi> and if he appear to be a perſon of Ingenuity, there's
no help for't, but he muſt go to Court, where he is careſs'd, on
purpoſe to get information of the Country from whence he comes.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Deputies, they obſtinately refuſ'd to ſend the
Letter to the <hi>Nahab:</hi> At which he was not a little troubl'd; fearing leſt
upon the Arrival of the <hi>French</hi> Veſſels, it might be the occaſion of a
Rupture, and hinder the concluſion of the Treaty of Commerce.
Moreover he was not a little jealous, leſt they ſhould ſeize upon the
<hi>Great Mogul</hi>'s Veſſels in their Voyage to <hi>Mecca,</hi> as <hi>Hugh Lambert</hi> the
<hi>Holland</hi> Pyrat did, who took all the Baggage belonging to the Queen
of <hi>Viſapour,</hi> when ſhe was going to <hi>Mecca</hi> and <hi>Medina.</hi> The <hi>Nahab</hi>
having made theſe Reflexions to himſelf, ſo wrought with the King,
that he conſented that the Deputies, contrary to cuſtom, ſhould be
admitted into his preſence, there to give the Letter into the Hands of
the Prime Miniſter, to be by him preſented to the King. This, as I ſaid
before, was an unuſual favour; and yet the Deputies were ſo obſtinate,
as to reject this Propoſition, ſaying, that they would rather return
home, and carry back their Letters, then not preſent them to the King
themſelves. This obſtinacy of theirs, to maintain their own conceited
humour againſt the Cuſtom of the Countrey, was very much blam'd
by all people, that admir'd at the patience of the <hi>Nahab,</hi> who at
length ſent them word, they might take their own courſe, ſince they
refuſ'd the Honours which he would have done them. After that,
the Deputies ſtaid ten or twelve days in the City, flattering themſelves,
that the <hi>Nahab</hi> would comply with their Folly; but they were deceiv'd.
For the <hi>Nahab</hi> offended at their idle carriage, took ſuch order, that
not one perſon living, either Merchant or other, went to viſit them
all the while. So that they reſolv'd to return to <hi>Surat,</hi> in expectation
of their Ships.</p>
            <p>When they left <hi>Agra,</hi> they went and lay two Leagues off from the
City in the Field, ſetting up one Tent apiece, (and thoſe pitiful ones
Heaven knows) to ſerve for them and their Servants, whereas they
might have lodg'd with more ſecurity in a fair Inn that ſtood not far
off. Now it is the Cuſtom at the <hi>Great Mogul</hi>'s Court, that every
Night ſome Prince or great Lord keeps Guard in his turn for a Week
together, having under him five or ſix thouſand Horſe, that beat the
Road for three or four Leagues round the place where the King quarters.
A Party of theſe Horſemen ſcouting by the Deputies Tents, and
enquiring whoſe they were, one of the Servants reply'd, that they were
the Tents of the <hi>French</hi> Deputies: of which the Horſemen gave
immediate notice to their Captain, at that time the Grand Provoſt of
the Empire. A Perſon handſom, well endow'd, and a great Lover of
Strangers, who had raiſ'd himſelf by his Valour, as being an <hi>Abyſſin</hi>
by Nation. So ſ<gap reason="illegible: broken" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n as he underſtood that they were the <hi>French</hi> Deputies,
he ſent one of his principal Officers, with fifty Horſe, to deſire them
to give them leave to guard them that Night, becauſe they were in no
ſecurity, and for that if they came to any miſchief the Head of their
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:103159:88"/>
Captain muſt anſwer for it. But they very ill receiv'd the kind proffer
of the Provoſt, proudly anſwering, that they were ſtrong enough to
guard themſelves, and the firſt that came near them ſhould know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>French</hi> had Courage or no, adding withal, that if their Captain
were afraid, they would guard him, with a deal of other ſcurrilous riffraff
which very much ſurpriz'd the Officers.</p>
            <p>The next day they ſet up their Tents about a quarter of a League far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
becauſe they expected ſomething to be brought them from <hi>Agra.</hi>
The <hi>Conteval</hi> or Grand Provoſt admiring they made ſuch ſlow journeys,
and that they had now pitch'd in a more dangerous place then before,
ſent the ſame Horſemen with the ſame proffer, or elſe that they would
be pleas'd to lye in an Inn where they might be ſafe. <hi>Boulaye</hi> was of the
mind that ſo kind an offer ſhould not be refus'd: but <hi>Beber</hi> gave them
nothing but bad language; reviling their Captain, that he was afraid
they ſhould go and lye with his wives, offering if he pleas'd to go and
guard them. He ſpoke half Portugueſe, half Italian, which being a kind
of <hi>Lingua Franca,</hi> ſome of the Horſemen made a ſhift to underſtand him,
and having made a report to the Grand Provoſt of his Inſolent Anſwer,
the Lord was not a little nettl'd at it, and therefore reſolv'd to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd.
About midnight fourſcore or a hundred Horſe came and cut
all the Cords of <hi>Bebers</hi> Tent, thinking to have let it fall about his ears. But
he found a way to quit himſelf by the aſſiſtance of his Servant; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to eſcape to the Houſe of a <hi>Dervich</hi> on the other ſide of a ſmall
Rivolet, nere the place where the Tents were ſet up. But the Moon
ſhining as bright as day, he could not hide himſelf from the purſuit of
the Horſemen, who ſhot at him, and with their Arrows wounded him
in three places, once in the thigh and twice in the buttocks. <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laye</hi>
hearing the noiſe which the Horſemen made, peep'd out of his Tent,
and ſeeing ſo many Horſemen in purſuit of <hi>Beber,</hi> was not a little daunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
He was afraid of running the ſame <hi>riſco;</hi> but not having long to
conſider, he took his purſe of Duckets, and fled till he got about half a
league off, where he lay all night under a great Tree. But by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
he found that the Horſemen had nothing to ſay to him; being
ſatisfi'd when they ſaw <hi>Beber</hi> fall, as believing him dead. For had they
not thought him ſo, they would never have left him, till they had quite
done his buſineſs. But to colour the buſineſs, that it might not ſeem
a point of revenge they broke open all <hi>Beber</hi>'s Cheſts; that it might ſeem
as if he had bin robb'd; but they found very little or nothing to enrich
themſelves.</p>
            <p>So ſoon as <hi>Beber</hi>'s boy ſaw that the Horſemen were gone, he ran to the
Town for a <hi>Pallanquin</hi> to carry his Maſter thither. Being brought to
the Town they laid him in the Jeſuits houſe, where <hi>Boulaye</hi> alſo arriv'd
not long after and took up his Quarters, to the great conſolation of the
Jeſuits, whoſe Revenues are but ſmall in thoſe parts, where there are
no devout people to leave them Legacies. Their Ordinary was very
ſparing; but it was ſuch as the Deputies muſt be glad of. Though it
were a feaſt for <hi>Boulaye,</hi> who was not wont to make better chear. For a
Sheeps head, of his own purchaſe, uſually ſerv'd him two meals. Which
made him ridiculous to the <hi>Franks,</hi> who liv'd after a more ſplendid rate.
At <hi>Smyrna</hi> and <hi>Aleppo,</hi> when he was not invited by the <hi>Franguis,</hi> he had
recourſe to his Sheeps tongues, or a cold piece of double Tripe, which
he carri'd to the poor <hi>Cabaretts</hi> of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> taking his Chopin of Wine
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103159:89"/>
to waſh it down: and ſuch was his good husbandry that what was left
was order'd to be ſet up for his ſupper. One day he had drank a little more
then he had bled, and the <hi>Franguis</hi> found him a ſleep in the ſtreet, about
a hundred paces from the Cabaret. They had ſo much charity for him as
to remove him to his lodging, leſt other Nations ſhould laugh at the
choice which they had made of an Envoy to ſettle the Trade of ſuch a
conſiderable Company. As for <hi>Beber,</hi> who lov'd good Chear when it
coſt him nothing, as being a true exemplar of covetouſneſs, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> entertainment, though they out-run the Conſtable to
treat him like a Deputy. His man who had more wit than he, and plainly
ſaw what a trouble he was to his Hoſts, made them a merry relation of
the Noble Table which his Maſter kept for him, how he had made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
of a Barrel of Herrings; which when Invitations fail'd, he wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
fed upon, rubbing his bread with the tail to give it a <hi>haut goust.</hi> For
my part, ſaid the Boy, I am but a poor Servant, yet I have made a ſhift
to ſpend an hundred and fifty Crowns which I had got in the ſervice of
the Conſul of <hi>Smyrna.</hi> 'Twas my misfortune to be inveigl'd out of his
ſervice, for I was with a Noble Maſter where I got Money; but in this
man's ſervice I have eaten all that I had got before. Two days after I
arriv'd at <hi>Agra,</hi> and heard of <hi>Beber</hi>'s being wounded and where he lay, and
went to give him a viſit. And as I never went unprovided in my travels
with all things neceſſary, I had ſome Oyntments and Plaſters, which
were very ſerviceable to him.</p>
            <p>It was an eaſie thing to obſerve that <hi>Boulaye</hi> was glad of the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of <hi>Beber</hi>'s being wounded, that he might have the ſole honour of
giving the Letter to the King. For he pretended to be the true <hi>Envoy</hi>
from the King of <hi>France,</hi> and that <hi>Beber</hi> was only ſent to bear him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
<hi>La Boulaye</hi> therefore believing that the buſineſs would take effect,
perſuaded the Chyrurgion already mention'd to ſolicit the <hi>Nahab</hi> who
had a kindneſs for him, ſo cloſe, that thereby the <hi>Nahab</hi> permitted him
to bring the Letter. But <hi>Boulaye</hi> who thought he ſhould give it himſelf
to the King, was much ſurpriz'd when he ſaw that the <hi>Nahab,</hi> who had
got the Letter into his own power, gave it to one of the meaneſt Officers
of his Court, who by the Prime Miniſter's order, gave it to another,
and he to a third, who brought it back to the <hi>Nahab,</hi> who at length pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
it to the King, but not in the preſence of <hi>Boulaye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus you ſee the Effect of the ridiculous pride of the Deputies,
<hi>Boulaye</hi> was forc'd to ſtay in an outer Court, having two more to paſs
thorough before he came into the King's Quarter. Where, while he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
big with expectation, word was brought him, that the King
would return an Anſwer to the King his Maſter, ſo ſoon as the Ships
ſhould be arriv'd; and ſo he was forc'd to go back to his Lodging with
the melancholy diſſatisfaction of a fruſtrate hope.</p>
            <p>The wounded Gentleman being new cur'd, but ſtill very lame, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd
Audience of the <hi>Nahab,</hi> that he might have juſtice for the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
done him by an Aſſaſſination and a Robbery. The <hi>Nahab</hi> readily
admitted him, limping when he came into his preſence worſe then
when he firſt left his bed. The firſt Compliment he made was of the
Wounds he had receiv'd, and then he demanded ſatisfaction for the loſs
of his Blood, and the Goods which had bin ſtolen from him. The <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi>
promis'd him to inform the King of the buſineſs, aſſuring him that
he ſhould have no wrong done him upon the high-way within the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103159:89"/>
where he had to do. Four or five days after, the <hi>Nahab</hi> ſent to
<hi>Beber</hi> to know how much the Loſs which he pretended to have receiv'd
amounted to. <hi>Beber</hi> brought in an account of four and twenty thouſand
<hi>Roupies,</hi> or 12000 Crowns, and for the loſs of his Blood, he left it to the
Kings Generoſity.</p>
            <p>His Accompt he made out thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Imprimis.</hi> A Note for the value of ſix thouſand <hi>Roupies</hi> which he had
lent a Merchant when he departed for <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> which Note was among
the Papers he had loſt. As to that, the <hi>Nahab</hi> ask'd him whether the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
in <hi>France</hi> did not make an Entry of ſuch publick Acts as were ſign'd
before them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Beber</hi> made anſwer, that he ſhould never be paid, if he could
not produce the ſame Paper that had bin taken from him, and that he
could not demand his Money without it. The <hi>Nahab</hi> replying; that
that was contrary to the Cuſtom of all Nations, and that he knew it could
not be as he ſaid, added withal, that he ſhould take no care for his ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
in that particular. After that he read on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item.</hi> Five thouſand <hi>Roupies</hi> in Gold and Silver Money.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item.</hi> Four thouſand <hi>Roupies</hi> in Gold Lace and Galoon to trim his
Clothes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item.</hi> Two Diamond Rings at two thouſand one hundred <hi>Roupies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item.</hi> Two other Rings, a Topaz, and another of ſea-green water,
which coſt three hundred <hi>Roupies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item.</hi> His Clothes, his Linnen, and for a Cheſt of Medicaments,
which might be worth 4000 <hi>Roupies;</hi> of which he had procur'd his Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon
to give in a Bill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item.</hi> A Chain of Gold valu'd at 500 <hi>Roupies.</hi> In all amounting to 24000
<hi>Roupies,</hi> as I ſaid before.</p>
            <p>Two or three days after, the King caus'd an Order to be deliver'd to
him for the payment of his Money at the Treaſury-Chamber. Upon
which Order, he agreed with a Merchant to be paid at <hi>Surat.</hi> And when
he was ready to depart, the King commanded 12000 <hi>Roupies</hi> to be paid
him for the loſs of his Blood. But that ſum he never receiv'd. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in haſte to be gone to <hi>Surat,</hi> and failing to preſent the <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> he
drill'd him out ſo long, that his patience was quite tir'd, and ſo he was
forc'd to go without it.</p>
            <p>I could never underſtand the Policy of the <hi>Great Mogul</hi> to pay <hi>Beber</hi>
the ſum which he ſaid had bin taken from him; when the <hi>Nahab</hi> knew
to a thread what he had loſt, and had given in an accompt thereof to the
King; the whole not amounting to 2000 <hi>Roupies.</hi> And as for the <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis,</hi>
ſo ſoon as they underſtood that he had demanded 4000 <hi>Roupies</hi> for
his Chirurgeons Cheſt, they all cry'd out that it was a meer cheat. For
a few days before <hi>Beber</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Agra,</hi> the Chirurgeon had receiv'd 200
<hi>Roupies</hi> by the Charity of the <hi>Franks</hi> to return to <hi>Surat,</hi> and he fell ſick
the next day that this Bill was preſented to the <hi>Nahab.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the <hi>Mogul</hi> had read the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Letter, the <hi>Nahab</hi> by
order of his Maſter, order'd a Lodging to be provided for the Deputies,
which overjoy'd the Jeſuits, who were by that means rid of two very
troubleſome Gueſts. As for <hi>Boulaye,</hi> in regard the King had ſignifi'd his
pleaſure, that he would not return any anſwer to the King's Letter till
the arrival of the Ships, he never troubled himſelf any farther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
ſtaid till the waters were fallen, that he might go to <hi>Bengale,</hi> and from
thence to <hi>Golconda</hi> to ſettle a Trade in thoſe parts. But <hi>Beber</hi> moil'd like
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103159:90"/>
a horſe, and did nothing but run to and fro, to know the King's pleaſure
touching the ſettlement of Trade. But the <hi>Nahab</hi> either laugh'd at him,
or took little notice of what he ſaid. For indeed by <hi>Beber</hi>'s outward
appearance, and deportment, no man could make any other judgment
of him, but that he was a poor ſpirited fellow, and one that knew not
what it was to live. For all the <hi>Europeans</hi> that travel into <hi>Perſia</hi> and the
<hi>Indies</hi> are always richly habited, nor would any of them keep <hi>Beber</hi>
company, who by his Habit look'd rather like a Footman, than a Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a Royal Company of Trade. At length a whim took him to
make himſelf a ſuit of painted Calicut, after the <hi>French</hi> Faſhion, the
like whereof had never been ſeen in the Country; the whole Suit not
ſtanding him in above 13 <hi>Livres</hi> and 13 <hi>Sous.</hi> For the trimming of his
new Suit he took off the Ribbands of his old Cloaths, which he was two
days lathering, and ſmoothing with a Taylers Gooſe. When he had
got this rare Habit upon his back, he went to viſit the <hi>Nahab,</hi> who was
then attended by the Principal Lords of the Court. Who when they
ſaw him enter, fell all a gazing upon him, and ask'd one another whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that <hi>Frangui</hi> were turn'd <hi>Faquir,</hi> or a <hi>Dervich</hi> of <hi>Hoſſen Mamout,</hi>
which they uſually call the ragged <hi>Saint.</hi> For you muſt know, that all
the <hi>Faquirs</hi> or <hi>Derviches</hi> that are of this Order, never apparel themſelves
but with ſuch rags as they pick up in the ſtreets, and if they meet with
any pieces better than other, they make of them a kind of Galoon to
trim the reſt. They alſo carry half Pikes, with a great company of
Tatters faſten'd to the end of them, to make a ſhew of their beggery. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>'s
Habit very much ſurpriz'd the <hi>Nahab,</hi> and all others that beheld
him ſo ridiculouſly accouter'd. As he paſs'd one morning by my win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
I bid him good morrow, telling him withal, that he look'd more
ſpruce and gay than he us'd to do. He reply'd, that he had reaſon ſo to
do, for that he had receiv'd Letters from <hi>Surat,</hi> by which he had advice,
that the Country people upon the Coaſt of <hi>Cape St. John</hi> had decry'd
four Veſſels out at Sea, which they could not make to be either <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
or <hi>Hollanders,</hi> from whence he concluded that they were the Companies
ſhips; and that he was going to the <hi>Nahab</hi> with the News. But I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
him at that time, telling him that I had often obſerv'd that raſcally
ſort of people to come both to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> with ſuch kind of
Intelligence, on purpoſe to get Money; when indeed they had never
ſeen any ſuch ſight, and admoniſhing him not to believe Reports upon
ſuch ſlight foundations. I ask'd him what date his Letters bore? he
told me, thirty days ago. Then, ſaid I, if the diſcovery had bin true,
the <hi>Nahab</hi> would have had notice of it in fourteen; and then he would
certainly have told you of it, or my ſelf; for it is but two days ſince I took
my leave of him. Thereupon he took my counſel and reſolv'd for <hi>Surat</hi>
in a few days.</p>
            <p>Three days after that the Chirurgeon had given in his Bill for the
Cheſt of Medicaments that he had loſt among <hi>Beber</hi>'s Baggage, he was
ſo touch'd in Conſcience, that he fell ſick, and dy'd in two days. Upon
his death-bed he ask'd pardon of God for the Cheat which he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to, to ask 4000 <hi>Roupies</hi> for that which was really worth but four
hundred; 200 of which he had receiv'd from the Charity of the <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis,</hi>
the reſt upon the ſale of a Horſe.</p>
            <p>For my part, finding that <hi>Beber</hi> was reſolv'd for <hi>Surat,</hi> I made what
haſt I could out of <hi>Agra,</hi> to be quit of his company. But the ſecond
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:103159:90"/>
day after my departure, having ſet up my tent by a Rivers ſide, juſt as I
was going to dinner I ſpy'd <hi>Beber</hi> coming, nor could I get rid of him
afterwards till I came to <hi>Surat.</hi> So that we were forc'd to travel toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
though he committed a thouſand Impertinencies by the way.
Among the reſt, he put one trick upon the Chief of the <hi>Cheraffs</hi> or
Bankers at <hi>Brampour,</hi> not to be paſſed over in ſilence.</p>
            <p>In regard the ways were bad, and that he had but one pitiful weak
Chariot, and four weak Boys, which with the help of Oxen, were
hardly ſtrong enough to help him out when he ſtuck in the mire, he ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
came to his journeys end till two or three hours after me. Now upon
the report that ran of the <hi>French</hi> ſhips being ſeen out at Sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
the general belief that <hi>Beber</hi> would be one of the Principal Truſtees
of the Company, ſeveral, as I ſaid before, courted him, and ſought to
engage his Friendſhip. Being arriv'd at <hi>Brampour,</hi> the Chief of the
<hi>Cheraffs,</hi> attended by a dozen of his ſervants came to viſit us. Upon the
firſt acquaintance <hi>Beber</hi> told him that he wanted a <hi>Pallaquin</hi> to go to <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi>
whereupon the <hi>Cheraff</hi> civilly offered him his, and caus'd it to be
trimm'd up for his better accommodation. <hi>Beber</hi> thought that trimming
would have bin finiſht in one day, when indeed it requir'd three or four.
The next day I order'd my Coach to be got ready, and order'd my <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laquin</hi>
to be carri'd away. <hi>Beber,</hi> who verily believ'd that the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny's
ſhips were already in the Road of <hi>Surat,</hi> began to curſe and bann
the <hi>Cheraff,</hi> who preſently came to him and endeavour'd to appeaſe him
with good words. He told him, it could be no prejudice to him to ſtay
a day or two; for by that time the Roads would be better, and he might
travel the faſter. But <hi>Beber,</hi> being tranſported with paſſion, was ſo
far from taking the <hi>Cheraffs</hi> reaſons for ſatisfaction, that ſnatching a
Cudgel out of his Waggoners hands that ſtood next to him, he gave
the <hi>Cheraff</hi> three or four good Licks croſs the ſhoulders. The Merchants
and other people that were in the Inn, were ſtrangely ſurpriz'd at ſuch a
piece of rudeneſs, and ran out preſently, ſome with Stones, and others
with Cudgels, making a hideous noiſe, and crying out, that they had
never ſeen the like. They took it for a moſt enormous Crime, to ſtrike
the Chief of the <hi>Cheraffs,</hi> above fourſcore years old, whoſe very age
ought to have bin protection enough from ſuch an Affront. Good luck
it was for <hi>Beber,</hi> after ſuch a raſh action committed, that I was well
known at <hi>Brampour,</hi> having been there ten or twelve times, and in ſome
of my Travels having dealt for above 200000 <hi>Roupies.</hi> There were
none of the <hi>Cheraffs</hi> with whom I had not dealt by Letters of Exchange,
and very few Merchants or Brokers who had not had ſome buſineſs or
other upon my accompt. They cry'd out, ſpeaking of me; See there the
Monſieur <hi>Franqui,</hi> with whom we have dealt ſo often, yet never heard
him give us an ill word. Another good chance he had to meet there
the <hi>Coutevall</hi>'s Lieutenant, and three Merchants of <hi>Surat;</hi> and thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us, having diſingag'd <hi>Beber</hi> out of the Brabble wherein he had
ſo ſillily bemir'd himſelf, we made him get into my Coach, and ſo packt
him out of the City. I follow'd him two hours after: for had he ſtaid
longer in <hi>Brampour,</hi> I believe the <hi>Faquirs</hi> and <hi>Derviches</hi> would have beat
out his brains. For he was no ſooner gone, but a great number of that
ſort of rabble came to the Inn, crying out, Where was that Dog of a
<hi>Cafer</hi> that had beaten the <hi>Cheraff.</hi> Thereupon, ſeeing the Multitude
encreaſe, I ſtole out of the Town, without ſaying a word, and rid on
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:103159:91"/>
till I got three leagues from <hi>Brampour,</hi> to an old Town call'd <hi>Badelpoura,</hi>
where I overtook <hi>Beber,</hi> who had hir'd a Coach made after the faſhion
of the Country. It was but reaſon, that I ſhould have my own Coach
to ſleep in in the night: For though in all places where you come to lye
in the night, the <hi>Indians</hi> will offer you a little bed to lye on, yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the rains were but juſt over, the bedſteads were ſo full of Puhies,
that there was no reſting. Theſe Punies are ingender'd by the moiſture
which the rains, that fall for four months together, cauſe in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.
Which being over, and the Sun recovering its wonted heat, the
women carry forth their beds every morning, and beating them, well
with good big ſticks, never leave till the Punies fall to the ground, and
there turning up their bellies preſently dye. Theſe beds conſiſt of four
feet and four round ſtayes, as broad and as long as you pleaſe. To the
ſtaves are faſten'd girths about four fingers broad, which are much more
commodious than the bottoms of our beds that are plank'd with Deal
or other wood. Over the girths they only lay a ſingle Coverlet or
Sheet, which is a manner of lying eaſie enough, conſidering the heat of
the Country.</p>
            <p>The fourth day after our departure from <hi>Brampour,</hi> being near a great
Town call'd <hi>Semqueles,</hi> in a flat Country, we perceiv'd all the Plain co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with Tents. It appear'd to be the Camp of one of the chief <hi>Kans,</hi>
or Lords, whom the <hi>Great Mogull</hi> had ſent with 50000 men againſt the
Rebel <hi>Raja Sevagi.</hi> This Lord, underſtanding who we were, very ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy
ſent us Melons, and Mango's, and bid his Officers tell us withal,
that we were out of all danger, and might ſafely purſue our journey.
Whatever I could ſay to <hi>Beber,</hi> to perſwade him that it was but an act
of civility and good manners, to wait upon the Prince, I could by no
means engage him. I ſeeing his impertinency, ſhifted my habit, and
ſent one of my ſervants to the Camp, to learn whether the <hi>Kan</hi> drank
Wine; and underſtanding that he did, I took a bottle of <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and
another of <hi>Schirus</hi> Wine, and a ſmall pocket Piſtol delicately embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd
with ſilver; and with this ſmall Preſent away I went to wait upon
the General. Being come into his Preſence, I excus'd <hi>Beber,</hi> as not
being well, and immediately preſented him the little Piſtol, which he
took, and bid me charge, being deſirous to try it. After he had ſhot it
off, ſaid he to his Lords that ſtood by, Now muſt we confeſs theſe <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui's</hi>
to be ingenious. This man ſees that I am going to the Wars, and
preſents me wherewithal to deſend my life. Then caſting his eyes
upon the little Hamper, where the Bottles were, he ask'd what it was?
They told him in his Ear. Oh, ſaid he, looking at the ſame time upon
two or three <hi>Mim Bachi's,</hi> or Colonels that were preſent, This <hi>Franqui</hi>
Gentleman has given me a bottle of Wine, well we muſt drink it;
for I find I ſhall pleaſe him in ſo doing. When the <hi>Mollah's</hi> heard him
talk of Wine, they ſlunk away; which made the <hi>Kan</hi> laugh heartily.
Theſe are <hi>Agi's,</hi> quoth he; they have bin Pilgrims to <hi>Mecca,</hi> and never
drink Wine after they come home again. Having taken my leave, he
ſent me a <hi>Pomere,</hi> which is a kind of Scarf that may alſo ſerve for a
Girdle. It was made of white Sattin with flow'rs of Gold, and might
be worth about a hundred <hi>Roupies.</hi> He that brought it, told me, I
ſhould do the <hi>Kan</hi> a great kindneſs, to ſend him another bottle of Wine:
thereupon I ſent him two of three, which was all my ſtore. He ſent
me ſix Horſemen to conduct us three days journey, till we had paſs'd a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:103159:91"/>
great River that flows from the Mountains of the South, which waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the City of <hi>Baroche,</hi> from whence it takes its Name, falls into the
Bay of <hi>Cambay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we came to our laſt ſtage, which is a great Town, call'd <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noli,</hi>
from whence it is but 14 Leagues to <hi>Surat, Beber</hi> ſent one of his
Hirelings to give notice thereof to Father <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> When the News
came, the Father went with the <hi>Aleppo</hi> Merchant, often already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
to borrow the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Preſident's Coaches: and there were about
15 or 16 more Coaches all in a train, with ſeveral Horſemen and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
<hi>Banians</hi> that made haſt to meet the Deputy. This happen'd
upon the firſt of <hi>November,</hi> 1666. They carri'd with them Proviſion
enough to make merry, and every <hi>Banian</hi> had his Preſent ready. For
my part, I as ſoon as I had ſaluted the Father Capuchin, I went directly
to my Lodging, where I had left two Servants to take care of a Sum of
Money which I had receiv'd of the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> unwilling to hazard
it upon the Road. For in whatever part of the <hi>Indies</hi> I came, I had
credit enough to buy without Money. I only gave my Bills for payment
at <hi>Agra, Viſapour, Golconda,</hi> or <hi>Surat,</hi> where I generally left my Money,
as having receiv'd it there for the moſt part of the Lords or Kings of the
Country.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Beber,</hi> he was no Changeling, the follies that he committed
are too numerous to be related: but how he began the year 1667, is not
to be omitted.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Thevenot,</hi> upon his return from <hi>Madraſpatan</hi> and <hi>Golconda,</hi> lodg'd
in the Capuchins houſe. <hi>Beber</hi> going to viſit him, told him, that the
Capuchins were the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Spies, and that he had often advis'd
Father <hi>Ambroſe</hi> to break with them, and not to go any more to their
Houſe. That while he frequented their Society, the <hi>French</hi> Company
would be ſure to find ſome obſtacle in their Trade when the Ships ſhould
arrive; and that if the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had not been at <hi>Agra,</hi> they might have
done what they pleas'd with the King. That the hundred thouſand
<hi>Roupies</hi> which they had preſented to the King and Grandees of the Court,
had hinder'd them from obtaining what they deſign'd. By which it
appear'd, he underſtood not the humour of the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> for they are
not ſo liberal: nor would all their tricks, or preſents have any thing
avail'd them, the <hi>Great Mogul</hi> being deſirous that all Nations ſhould be
welcome to his Dominions, eſpecially Merchants, as well they that
import little, as they that bring in much. M. <hi>Thevenot</hi> told him, that
he had never obſerv'd ſo much of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> in all his travels; for if
it were true, that they had ſuch a deſire to hinder the Trade of other
Nations, they would not afford them paſſage in their Ships, or to put
their Goods aboard, as they often did. Moreover, they ſend away many
times one or two Ships according to the quantity, laden all with ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
Goods, from <hi>Maſlipatan</hi> or <hi>Surat,</hi> in which Ships, there is not oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſo much as one Bale belonging to the Company. And this, added
he, is farther obſervable, That they afford their Freight cheaper then
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or any other Nation, who have Ships in theſe parts. Thus
Monſieur <hi>Thevenot</hi> endeavour'd to convince M. <hi>Beber;</hi> who would have
had Father <hi>Ambroſe</hi> have fallen out with the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> But he knew
better things then to diſoblige perſons to whom he was ſo much behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as he was every day. For every week they allow'd the houſe a
certain quantity of Bread and Meat, and upon Faſt-days ſent them Fiſh,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:103159:92"/>
Eggs, Brandy, and Wine, which were no ſuch unkindneſſes to be
quarrell'd with. Monſieur <hi>Thevenot</hi> at the ſame time told <hi>Beber,</hi> that
he ſhould do well to repay Father <hi>Ambroſe</hi> the Money which he had
borrow'd to pay for the Coach which he had broken to ſerve him, as
alſo that which he had given the Seamen, for trying if they could
diſcover the <hi>Companies</hi> Veſſels upon the Coaſt. But he turn'd his deaf
ear to that diſcourſe, and would never be perſuaded to reimburſe the
Money which Father <hi>Ambroſe</hi> laid out for him. Monſieur <hi>Thevenot</hi>
perceiving his unwillingneſs, and preſſing him to do things handſomly,
put him into ſuch a chaſe, that he fell a ſwearing after ſuch a violent rate,
in a Parlour, that was parted only by a thin board from the place where
the Maſs was ſaid, that one of the Fryers, juſt ready to go to the Altar,
came forth to deſire him to leave his blaſpheming. But <hi>Beber</hi>'s inſolence
took his admonition ſo ill, that he very rudely beat the Fryer in Mr. <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venot</hi>'s
preſence; ſwearing, That had it not been out of reſpect to him,
he would have knockt him o' the head. The Capuchin being ſo inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
us'd, came to Me, being hardly able to ſtir his neck, by reaſon
of one of the blows that <hi>Beber</hi> had given him. I chaft his neck with
Oyl of Coco's, and wrapt it up warm: but we durſt not ſpeak a word
of <hi>Beber</hi>'s idle action, for fear of expoſing our ſelves to the laughter of
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who would have made good ſport with it.
Beſides theſe Enormities, he put away his Servant that had ſav'd his
Life, and kept his Wages. After that he went to lye at an Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
houſe, whoſe Name was <hi>Mouillon,</hi> who came from <hi>Goa,</hi> with a
good quantity of <hi>Portugal</hi> Wine, and kept a Tavern at <hi>Surat.</hi> While
he lay there he had a great Conteſt with the Merchant, who receiv'd
the 24000 <hi>Roupies,</hi> which the King had given him for the loſs which he
alleadg'd that he and his Chyrurgeon had ſuſtain'd. For the Merchant
would acknowledge the receipt of no more then 23900 <hi>Roupies,</hi> the
other Hundred being deducted for Fees of the Treaſury. He alſo main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
That the Merchant had receiv'd the 12000 <hi>Roupies</hi> which the King
had allow'd him for the loſs of his Blood: but it was known that the
Grand Treaſurer would never pay that Money. Thus when he ſaw that
his Cheats were diſcover'd to all the World, he began to bethink him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
how to get away: and we obſerv'd, that he would fain have quitted
<hi>Surat</hi> without noiſe. But there is ſuch good Order taken both by Land
and Sea, that no perſon can go away without the knowledge and leave
of the Governour. For as the Countrymen that come from the other
ſide of the water cannot return unleſs they ſhew a mark in their hands
made with red Earth at the Cuſtom-houſe; neither Horſe nor Coach
can ſtir without a Note from the <hi>Chabander,</hi> and another for the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars,</hi>
who lye ſometimes two or three Leagues from the Town. <hi>Beber</hi>
nevertheleſs had ſome aſſurance from his Vintner, that he might get
into a Boat, by bidding the Boatmen carry him to <hi>Reynel,</hi> a large Town
on the other ſide of the water. The Maſter of the Boat ask'd him for
his Ticket, but <hi>Beber</hi> anſwer'd him with his Cudgel, forcing him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and telling him, he was not to demand Billets of ſuch a perſon as
he was. As he was got half way the River a great number of Souldiers
hollow'd after the Boatmen, to row the Strangers back aſhoar. But
<hi>Beber</hi> laid his hand upon his Sword, and compell'd the Boatmen to go
forward. That evening, <hi>Beber</hi> being return'd, the poor Boatmen were
apprehended, and baſtinado'd till they were almoſt maim'd. The
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103159:92"/>
people cri'd out, that it was the <hi>Frangui</hi> that ought to be ſo ſerv'd, and not
the poor Watermen, who had done nothing but by conſtraint.</p>
            <p>Thus did this Envoy behave himſelf both in <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>India,</hi> to the
great hindrance of the <hi>French</hi> Nation. Now let us ſee what became of
both <hi>Boulaye</hi> and <hi>Beber</hi> after all their Extravagancies.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sieur de la Boulaye,</hi> according to the accompt given by the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
that were at <hi>Agra,</hi> left the Town five or ſix days after my departure.
Knowing I went to <hi>Surat,</hi> he had plaid his game ſo well with me, that
he got a Hamper of twelve large bottles of Wine for 138 <hi>Roupies,</hi> though
they coſt me more, for which he gave me a Note of his hand, that I
have ſtill in my cuſtody, to be paid at <hi>Surat,</hi> upon the arrival of the
<hi>French</hi> Companies ſhips. From thence he travell'd to <hi>Patna,</hi> where he
ſtaid nine or ten days, partly with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> partly with the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:</hi>
from whence he departed for <hi>Daca,</hi> the Reſidence of the Governour
of the Province. The Governour of the Province of <hi>Bengale</hi> was
then the <hi>Great Mogul</hi>'s Uncle, whoſe name was <hi>Cha-Eſt-Kan,</hi> a potent
Prince, who has always under his Command thirty or forty thouſand
men.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Patna, Boulaye</hi> had a project, that from thence he might eaſily paſs
into <hi>China,</hi> and to that purpoſe he there embarqu'd with ſome <hi>Perſian</hi>
Souldiers, who were going to liſt themſelves under <hi>Cha-Eſt-Kan.</hi> But
after that, to this hour, it never could be certainly known what became
of him: but by all probable conjectures, it is verily believ'd, that the
<hi>Perſian</hi> Souldiers murder'd him and his little Slave, in hopes of ſome
good booty. Of the truth whereof, the Obſervation that follows was
no ſmall evidence. About a quarter of a mile from <hi>Daca</hi> lies a Town,
where five ſeveral mungrel <hi>Portugal</hi> Officers, belonging to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Bengale,</hi> as Canoneers and Carpenters, and ſome of the ſame
Nation that ſerve in the Cavalry of <hi>Cha-Eſt-Kan.</hi> There they have alſo
a ſmall Church very well built, where an <hi>Auſtin</hi> Fryar officiates, to
whom, about three months after <hi>Boulaye</hi>'s departure from <hi>Patna,</hi> a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Perſian</hi> in the Habit of a Souldier, with two more companions,
brought two large Books, the one in <hi>Folio,</hi> and the other in <hi>Quarto</hi> to
ſell. The Fryar, who was a mungrel alſo, underſtood no <hi>Latin;</hi> but
finding them not to be in the <hi>Portugal</hi> Language, would have ſtopp'd
the Books as ſtoln from the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> had not the Souldier been too
ſtrong for him. Theſe Books were thought to have been <hi>Boulaye</hi>'s;
who, to my knowledge, had two Cheſts full, well bound; in reading
whereof he ſpent the greateſt part of his time. His Avarice was his
Ruine; for had he taken a Bark by himſelf, as I did when I went from
<hi>Patna,</hi> and had oblig'd the Watermen to give him good ſecurity, he
could have run no hazard. For my part I took one with four and twenty
men; and every one, knowing I never ſpar'd for coſt, gave me excellent
ſecurity. Theſe Barks are little Galliots, which will undertake to carry
you to your journey's end, and name your own day. If you will lye
aſhoar every evening, they will ſet up your Tents; and ſtop at any
Town or City to take in Proviſions. I never made ſo pleaſant a Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
in my life, nor with leſs trouble. For in theſe Barks, there is a
Room where the Sun cannot come in, where you may repoſe in the day
time, and ſit in the cool Air on that ſide from whence the Breez comes.
There is another place cover'd for your Kitchin; and another little
Garderobe for the private deeds of Nature. By the way I kill'd great
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:103159:93"/>
ſtore of large Geeſe, Cranes, and Crocodiles, which I gave the Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who were very glad of them; for they ſold them in the Towns
as they row'd along. The people in thoſe quarters are very good natur'd
and officious. Dyet is little worth, as being the place where you may
buy a hundred Pullets for a Crown: and for three or four Pence, you may
buy a Fiſh of a prodigious length and bigneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beber</hi>'s end was no leſs ſad. For when the <hi>French</hi> Companies Ships
were arriv'd, M. <hi>Caron,</hi> who commanded them, and M. <hi>Rambos,</hi> with an
<hi>Armenian,</hi> who had the management of the chiefeſt part of the buſineſs,
had been acquainted with what had paſs'd at <hi>Surat,</hi> between <hi>Beber</hi> and
the Capuchins. Preſently Affections and Intereſts parted. <hi>Caron</hi> and
<hi>Rambos</hi> took <hi>Beber</hi>'s part; the <hi>Armenian</hi> held for the Capuchins, which
was at length the ruin of <hi>Beber</hi> and <hi>Rambos.</hi> The <hi>Holland</hi> Commander
going aboard to viſit the Sieur <hi>Caron,</hi> upon his return would not permit
the Captain to ſtir out of his Cabin; ſo that <hi>Rambos</hi> and the <hi>Armenian</hi>
took upon them to wait upon the Commander. Upon this Occaſion
the <hi>Armenian</hi> took upon him to precede <hi>Rambos,</hi> and briskly threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
before the <hi>French</hi>-man; who being provok'd at the Affront, gave
the <hi>Armenian</hi> a ſwinging cuff o' the Ear before all the company. To be
ſhort, the Sieur <hi>Caron, Rambos,</hi> and <hi>Beber</hi> holding all together, the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian</hi>
found himſelf too weak to reſiſt: and in regard he had the
Management of the Caſh, he was accus'd of Misbehaviour, and was
condemn'd to be hang'd. But becauſe they could not execute the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
which they had given at <hi>Surat,</hi> they ſent him away to the Council
Royal of the Iſland of <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> of which M. <hi>Mondevergue</hi> was chief;
who was ſo far from confirming the Sentence given at <hi>Surat,</hi> that he
admitted the <hi>Armenian</hi> to juſtifie himſelf; and finding that he was not
only innocent, but that he might be very uſeful to the Company, he
ſent him back to <hi>Surat</hi> with more power then he had before. This put
<hi>Beber</hi> and <hi>Rambos</hi> into a fit of Deſpair, to ſee the perſon whom they
thought to have ruin'd, now above them. Thereupon they found a
way to get 12000 <hi>Roupies</hi> a piece for their Wages, which they pretended
to be due from the Company: and with that and 24000 <hi>Roupies</hi> which
<hi>Beber</hi> had of his own they Embarqu'd both together for <hi>Goa.</hi> Where,
being arriv'd, <hi>Beber</hi> dy'd ſoon after: But as for <hi>Rambos,</hi> he return'd home
again through <hi>Iſpahan.</hi>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS
UPON THE
TRADE
OF THE
EAST-INDIES.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat Nation which has a deſign to ſettle a Trade in the
<hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> muſt be ſure in the firſt place, to poſſeſs
themſelves of a convenient place in that Country, to
carine their Ships, and ſhelter themſelves during the
tempeſtuous Seaſons. This want of a good Haven is
the reaſon that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have not made thoſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
which otherwiſe they might have done; becauſe
it is impoſſible that any Veſſel ſhould remain in thoſe
Seas without being carin'd, or elſe eaten by the worms.</p>
            <p>Therefore, becauſe it is a long way from <hi>Europe</hi> to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> it
would be requiſite to have a retreating place at the <hi>Cape of good Hope,</hi> to
take in freſh Water and Proviſions, whether going or coming; but
eſpecially in their return, in regard that the Ships being then laden, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
take in Water for any long time.</p>
            <p>The Road of the Iſland of <hi>St. Helen</hi>'s, where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have built
a Fort, is a very commodious place: and if the Water be not ſo good
upon the North-ſide, yet the Plain is an excellent ſpot of Ground to ſow,
with convenience of all things neceſſary for human ſupport.</p>
            <p>This advantage the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> have depriv'd all other Nations
of, by their Forts upon the <hi>Cape of good Hope,</hi> and <hi>St. Helen</hi>'s. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſome River's mouth, near the <hi>Cape of good Hope,</hi> ought to be ſought
for, for the ſame purpoſe, which would be far more convenient then
the <hi>Dauphin Iſland,</hi> where there is no Trade but that of buying Cattel
for their Hides; which being a Trade of ſo little conſequence, would
ruin a Company to follow it.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why I make this Propoſal is, becauſe that in the year 1648,
two <hi>Portugal</hi> Veſſels being bound from <hi>Lisbon</hi> to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and
reſolving to touch at the <hi>Cape,</hi> to take in freſh Water, miſtook their juſt
Depths, ſo that the Sea running high, they fell into a Bay, 18 or 20
Leagues from the <hi>Cape,</hi> upon the Coaſt that looks to the Weſt. In that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:103159:94"/>
Bay they found a River, whoſe Water was very good; and the Blacks
of the Country brought them Refreſhments of all ſorts of Fowl, Fiſh,
and Bullock's fleſh. There they ſtaid above 15 days, and before they
ſet ſail, they took two of the <hi>Negro's,</hi> which they carri'd along with
them to <hi>Goa;</hi> to teach them the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Language; on purpoſe to try
if they could diſcover by them any knowledge of the Trade of the
Country. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Commander at <hi>Surat</hi> deſir'd me, to inform my
ſelf, when I went to <hi>Goa,</hi> what the <hi>Portugals</hi> had learnt from thoſe two
<hi>Negro's.</hi> But one <hi>St. Amand,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Ingeneer, who was Superviſor
of the Fortifications of <hi>Goa,</hi> told me, That he could not make them learn
one word of the Language; and that he could only gueſs by their ſigns,
that they had ſome knowledge of <hi>Ambergreece</hi> and <hi>Elephants Teeth.</hi>
The <hi>Portugals</hi> however made no queſtion but to meet with Gold, if they
could find a way to trade higher up i' the Country. The Revolutions
of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and their Wars with <hi>Spain</hi> have hinder'd them from making
any more particular diſcovery of the Coaſt. Which it were to be wiſh'd
the <hi>French</hi> would undertake, provided they gave no cauſe of jealouſie to
the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> of what they were going about.</p>
            <p>There is alſo a neceſſity of poſſeſſing, or at leaſt having the liberty
of ſome place near <hi>Surat,</hi> to ride ſafe in, and to waſh and tallow in, in
caſe they ſhould be ſtaid by the Rain-Seaſons. The reaſon is, becauſe
that during that ill ſeaſon, at what time it is impoſſible to keep the Seas,
the <hi>Mogul</hi> jealous of his Fortreſs of <hi>Surat</hi> ſuffers no Foreign Veſſel in the
River, where nevertheleſs, the Ships being unladen, may ride ſecurely
from the terrible Tempeſts that laſt for five Months.</p>
            <p>The only ſecure place for the Companies Veſſels would be the Town
of <hi>Dia,</hi> belonging to the <hi>Portugals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The advantage of the ſituation is conſiderable for ſeveral reaſons.
The circuit of the City contains almoſt 400 Houſes, and might be
capable to receive a greater number of people, where the Ships would
find all conveniencies during their ſtay. It is ſeated upon the Coaſt
of <hi>Guzerat,</hi> upon a point of the Gulph of <hi>Cambaye,</hi> looking toward the
South-eaſt. The form of it is almoſt round; and above half the Circle
environ'd by the Sea. It is not commanded by any Hill; and the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals</hi>
have begun thoſe Fortifications, which might be eaſily finiſh'd.
It contains ſeveral Wells of very good Water, and a River which falls
into the Sea near the City, whoſe Water is better then that of <hi>Surat,</hi> or
<hi>Souali,</hi> and the Harbour is very commodious for Shipping.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Portugals,</hi> when they had firſt ſettl'd themſelves in the <hi>Indies,</hi>
kept there a Fleet compos'd of Galleys, Brigantines, and other light
Veſſels, whereby they made themſelves Maſters, for a long time, of all
the Trade of the Places we have treated of. So that no Ship could
trade, without the Governour of <hi>Dia</hi>'s Paſsport, who made it in the Name
of the Viceroy that liv'd at <hi>Goa.</hi> The Impoſition, which the Ships paid,
was ſufficient to maintain the Fleet and Garriſon, and to enrich the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
beſides.</p>
            <p>When the Rain-Seaſons are over, that the wind ſits at North and
North-eaſt, you may ſail from <hi>Dia</hi> to <hi>Surat</hi> in three or four Tides with
light Veſſels; but great Ships that are laden muſt fetch a compaſs about
the Bank.</p>
            <p>The City has no Land belonging to it, but what it ſtands upon, yet
it would be no difficult thing to agree with the <hi>Raja,</hi> or Govervour of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103159:94"/>
the Province, and to obtain as much as ſhould be ſufficient for the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants.</p>
            <p>Neither is the Land about it very fertile, and beſides, the people are
the pooreſt in the whole Empire of the <hi>Mogul.</hi> Nevertheleſs the Country
is ſo well ſtor'd with Cattel, that an Ox or a <hi>Bufalo</hi> will not coſt above
two <hi>Piaſters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> make uſe of theſe Cattel to feed their
People, and to ſpare the Proviſions of their Ships, while they ſtay at
<hi>Souali.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is obſervable that the <hi>Bufalo</hi>'s fleſh in thoſe parts cauſes frequent
Dyſenteries, which the Bullocks fleſh or Beef never does.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Raja</hi> that commands the Country has only the Title of Governour
for life. Which is common to moſt of the <hi>Raja's</hi> in the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
whoſe Anceſtours were Lords of Provinces, where now their
Deſcendants only enjoy the Titles of Governours.</p>
            <p>Having thus got poſſeſſion of a good Poſt; the next thing of Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is to chooſe out two men conſiderable for their Honeſty Prudence,
and Skill in Trade, who are to be allow'd the full of their Expences.</p>
            <p>Theſe two perſons are to ſerve the Company, the one in the nature
of a Preſident, with a Council, conſiſting of a certain number of perſons,
to aſſiſt him. The other in the quality of a Broaker, who muſt be an
Idolater of the Country, and not a <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> in regard all the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
he has to deal with are Idolaters.</p>
            <p>Civility and Faith of Promiſe are altogether requiſit to gain Credit
among ſtrangers. And theſe particular qualities are requir'd in the
particular Broakers, who are under the Broaker-General in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
where the Factories are ſettl'd.</p>
            <p>Good Intelligence is neceſſary for theſe two perſons, to underſtand
the alteration of Manufactures.</p>
            <p>This alteration happens either through the craft and ſubtilty of the
Workmen and the Merchants themſelves, or by the correſpondence of
the Broakers and Workmen.</p>
            <p>Which alteration may cauſe ſo much dammage to the Company, that
the Broakers ſhall gain ten and twelve i' the hundred by it.</p>
            <p>If the Preſident and Broaker-General combine with the particular
Broakers and Merchants, it will be a difficult thing for the Company to
avoid being deceiv'd; but if theſe two perſons are but faithful and honeſt,
the fraud may be eaſily remedi'd by changing the particular Broakers.</p>
            <p>The Officers of a Company may be unfaithful to their Truſt in this
reſpect:</p>
            <p>When a Veſſel arrives in Port, the Preſident for the Nation receives
the Company's Letters, and the Bills of Lading; upon which he calls
his Council, ſends for the Broaker, and gives him a Copy of the ſaid
Bills.</p>
            <p>The Broaker ſhews them to three or four of the principal Merchants
of the Country, who are wont to buy by whole ſale. If the Preſident
and the Broaker hold together for their own profit, the Broaker inſtead
of facilitating the ſale as he ought to do, adviſes the Merchants to be
ſhie, and to offer only ſuch a price: Then the Preſident ſends for the
Broaker and theſe two or three Merchants; and in the preſence of the
Council he asks the Merchants what they will give for the Goods in
the Bills of Lading mention'd. If the Merchants are reſolute to give
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103159:95"/>
no more then ſo much; The Preſident puts off the ſale 15 days longer,
more or leſs, as he pretends himſelf preſs'd to ſell. In the mean time
he ſends for the Merchants ſeveral times for a ſhew, and at length, to
avoid ſuſpicion, and to diſcharge himſelf, he asks the advice of the
Council, and as they approve, orders the delivery of the Goods to the
Merchant.</p>
            <p>But though the Temptations be very great, to which theſe two Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
are ſubject, by reaſon of their pow'r, their frequent opportunities,
and their diſtance from their Superiours, the Company, beſides their
being wary in their Election, may remedy theſe diſorders by depriving
them of that pretence, which the <hi>Dutch</hi> Commanders and Broakers
have, of being conſtrain'd to ſell off preſently to the Merchants in groſs,
to avoid the expences of delay.</p>
            <p>The Errour which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> commit in this reſpect is, That their
Officers beſpeak every year upon Credit all the Goods which they have
occaſion for in the Empire of the <hi>Mogul,</hi> according to the Orders which
they receive from <hi>Batavia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The credit of this Advance coſts them ſometimes twelve, ſometimes
fifteen <hi>per Cent;</hi> ſo that ſo ſoon as their laden Veſſels are arriv'd in the
the Port where they are to be ſold, they are oblig'd to ſell them preſently
off at the Merchants rate firſt offer'd to their Broakers, to make up a
preſent ſtock to pay off their credit for the Goods beſpoke for their Ships
to carry back again, and to get more credit for the next year. This is
that which cheriſhes that confederacy between the Preſident, the Broaker
and the Merchant, who makes advantage enough of this neceſſity of
ſelling.</p>
            <p>Whereas the better way were, for them that carry the ſame Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> do, to carry Money alſo to pay the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
for the Goods beſpoken for the next year.</p>
            <p>The Company making this advantage ſhall not be put to pay that
great Intereſt of 12 and 15 <hi>per Cent.:</hi> and beſides, they ſhall have better
Goods, and better cheap. The Ships loading ſhall be ready before they
arrive in Port; and being quick laden they may return before the bad
Seaſon. Neither ſhall the Company be put to ſell their Goods at a low
price; becauſe their Broakers will have time to ſtay for the coming of
Merchants from other parts; or elſe becauſe they have time enough to
ſend them to other places, where they are ſure of a quicker ſale.</p>
            <p>Obſerve alſo, That it is far more profitable to carry to the <hi>Indies</hi> Gold
and Silver in Ingots, rather then ready coin'd; for being coin'd the
Money is valu'd only according to their Alloys; and there is always a
defalcation made for the charge of Coinage.</p>
            <p>The Broaker alſo, if he be diſhoneſt, may combine with the Maſter
of the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Mint, which is ſettl'd in ſeveral parts of the Empire, and
put a lower value upon the Gold and Silver then it deſerves, by telling
the Preſident and Council, that upon the touch it appears to be no more
worth.</p>
            <p>But it is an eaſie thing to avoid this deceit, provided the Preſident be
a perſon of credit and prudence, by ſending for one of the Refiners of
Gold and Silver, that live in the Country, who perfectly underſtand the
Touch of Metals, and to let him Eſſay the Gold and Silver before the
Broaker's face.</p>
            <p>This is that which the Sieur <hi>Walkenton</hi> did for the <hi>Holland</hi> Company
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:103159:95"/>
in their Factory at <hi>Caſambazar,</hi> where he bought every year ſix or ſeven
thouſand Bales of Silk. For by this Eſſay he found, that his Broaker
being in confederacy with the Maſter of the Mint, had cheated the
Company of one and a half and two <hi>per Cent.</hi> in the value of the Gold
and Silver which was brought him from <hi>Japan,</hi> as well coin'd as in barr,
to a very conſiderable ſum of Money.</p>
            <p>The Broaker alſo may confederate with the Maſter of the Mint to
couzen the Merchant in weghing his Gold or Silver, by making uſe of
falſe Weights or Scales unduly pois'd.</p>
            <p>But that fraud is eaſily avoided, if the Preſident and his Council will
be but ſo patient as to ſee their Metal weigh'd themſelves, and take care
that the Weights be right, and the Scales true.</p>
            <p>One of the moſt important Obſervations in reference to the Trade of
the Company, and diſcipline of their Factories is this:</p>
            <p>To prevent the Merchants or under-Merchants, Accomptants and
under-Accomptants, who officiate under the Commanders and Broakers,
from driving any particular Trade by themſelves, for they having a
familiarity with the men of Manufacture, and finding by the Letters of
Advice what Goods are likely to be moſt vendible next year, buy them up
upon their own accompts, and find a way to lade them off in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's
Veſſels, to the great dammage of the whole, though to the great
gain of particular people.</p>
            <p>And this the Preſident permits them to do, either for his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
or by connivance under the pretence of their ſmall Wages. The
Captain of the Veſſel alſo winks at what they do, becauſe he has a ſpell
for loading and unloading. And becauſe theſe people having no great
Stocks, are deſirous to put off their Goods with the firſt opportunities,
they give order to their Correſpondents to under-ſell the Company ten
or twelve in the Hundred, which is the abſolute ruin of a Trade.</p>
            <p>To remedy this diſorder there ought to be a Fiſcal, or King's Proctor,
in every of the chief Factories belonging to the Company, to act in the
King's Name, and by his Authority.</p>
            <p>He is to be independent from the Preſident and the Broaker, in the
Exerciſe of his Office; ſo that he may have an eye, as well upon their
behaviour, as upon the demeanour of the under Officers.</p>
            <p>He ought to be a perſon of good Credit, reſolute and vigilant; and
he muſt have a ſtrength of men correſpondent to his Employment, and
a Deputy to act under him.</p>
            <p>He is to have good Information of the departure of all Ships when
they are once laden, and when they are ready to ſet ſail for the Port
whither they are bound. When he hears of the Arrival of any Ship,
he ought to go himſelf, or ſend his Deputy with a ſufficient Guard, to
take an Accompt of the Ship's Lading.</p>
            <p>If it be a place near to which there are any ſmall Iſlands, or by-Nooks, it
behoves him to take care that no Goods be privately convey'd aſhoar
in thoſe private corners, where there are receivers a now ready: and
whatever he finds thus privately unladen he ſhall have power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcate.</p>
            <p>He ſhall alſo confiſcate whatever he finds not Mark'd with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's
Mark.</p>
            <p>He may alſo diſcharge any inferiour Officers to whom any ſuch Bales
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103159:96"/>
ſhall belong; and for the ſuperiour Officers, he ſhall complain of them to
the Company.</p>
            <p>He ſhall have pow'r to open all private Letters, to inform himſelf of
Prohibited Goods, and Private Correſpondencies.</p>
            <p>This Prohibition of Private Trading cannot be too ſeverely impos'd,
and it is obſerv'd with ſo much exactneſs in <hi>Holland,</hi> that when one of
the Company's Ships is ready to ſet ſail from <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> a Burgomaſter
gives the Captain and all the reſt of the Seamen their Oaths, that they
ſhall be contented with their Wages, and meddle with nothing of
Trade.</p>
            <p>All the Officers of the Factory ſhould be advanc'd by degrees, ſo that a
ſub-Accomptant may have hopes to be a Preſident; that the hopes of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
may oblige them to live with more credit, and cauſe them to
ſtudy to make themſelves more capable of all the Intrigues and Subtilties
of the Trade of the Country.</p>
            <p>It is of great importance not to ſhew any favour in this particular of
preferment, unleſs he have paſs'd through all particular Degrees and
Offices beforehand. And thus much concerning the Diſcipline of the
Factories.</p>

did not the Merchants of <hi>Tartary,</hi> and the <hi>Mogul</hi>'s

and to <hi>Surat,</hi> where it is wrought up.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place they make Carpets of Silk and Gold, others of Silk

               <p>The Calicuts that come from <hi>Renonſari,</hi> and <hi>Baroche,</hi> are one and twenty

               <p>The broad <hi>Bafta</hi>'s are a cubit, and one third part wide; the whole

in price.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, it comes from the Territories of <hi>Biana, Indoua,</hi> and
<hi>Corſa</hi> a day or two's journey from <hi>Agra:</hi> which is eſteem'd the beſt of all.
It is made alſo eight days journey from <hi>Surat,</hi> in a Village called <hi>Sarqueſs,</hi>
two leagues diſtance from <hi>Amadabat.</hi> Here the flat <hi>Indigo</hi> is made. There
is alſo <hi>Indigo</hi> little inferior in goodneſs and price, which comes from the
King of <hi>Golconda</hi>'s Territories. The <hi>Mein</hi> of <hi>Surat,</hi> which contains
42 <hi>Serre's,</hi> or 34 and a half of our pounds, is valu'd from 15 to 20
<hi>Roupies.</hi> They make as good as this at <hi>Baroche.</hi> That which is made up
about <hi>Agra</hi> is made up in half Balls, and is the moſt ſought for in all <hi>India.</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:103159:98"/>
It is ſold by the <hi>Mein,</hi> which in thoſe places contains 60 <hi>Serres,</hi> or 51 and
three quarters of our pounds. The uſual price is from 36 to 40 <hi>Roupies.</hi>
There grows alſo <hi>Indigo</hi> ſome 36 leagues from <hi>Brampour,</hi> about a great
Village call'd <hi>Raout,</hi> and round about the neighbouring Towns in the
road to <hi>Surat:</hi> Of which the Natives uſually make above a hunder'd-thouſand
<hi>Roupies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There comes <hi>Indigo</hi> alſo from <hi>Bengala,</hi> which the <hi>Holland</hi>-Company
tranſports for <hi>Maſlipatan.</hi> But they buy this <hi>Indigo,</hi> and that of <hi>Brampour</hi>
and <hi>Amadabat,</hi> cheaper by 24 in the hunder'd, then that of <hi>Agra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Indigo</hi> is made of an Herb which they ſow every year after the rains are
over: which when it is grown up, is very like our Hemp. They cut it
three times a year; firſt when it is about two or three foot high; and
they cut it within half a foot of the ground; the firſt cutting far exceeds
the two latter. The ſecond cutting is worſe then the firſt by ten or
twelve in the hunder'd. And the third worſe then the ſecond by 12 in the
hunder'd. The difference is found by breaking a piece of the Paſte, and
obſerving the colour. The colour of that <hi>Indigo</hi> which is made of the firſt
cutting, is a Violet-blue, but more brisk and lively than the two others:
and that which is made of the ſecond is more lively then the third.</p>
               <p>When they have cut the Herb, they throw it into Pits which they
make with Lime, which becomes ſo hard, that you would judg it to be
one intire piece of Marble. They are generally fourſcore or a hunder'd
paces in circuit; and being half full of water, they fill them quite up
with the Herb. Then they bruiſe and jumble it in the water till the leaf,
for the ſtalk is worth nothing, becomes like a kind of thick mud. This
being done, they let it ſettle for ſome days; and when the ſetling is all at
the bottom, and the water clear above, they let out all the water. When
the water is all drain'd out, they fill ſeveral baskets with this ſlime, and
in a plain Field you ſhall ſee ſeveral men at work, every one at his own
basket, making up little pieces of <hi>Indigo</hi> flat at the bottom, at the top
ſharp like an egg. Though at <hi>Amadabat</hi> they make their pieces quite flat
like a ſmall cake. Here you are to take particular notice, that the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
becauſe they would not pay cuſtom for an unneceſſary weight,
before they tranſport their <hi>Indigo</hi> out of <hi>Aſia</hi> into <hi>Europe,</hi> are very careful
to cauſe it to be ſifted, to ſeparate the duſt from it; which they ſell
afterwards to the Natives of the Countrey to dye their Calicuts. They
that ſift this <hi>Indigo</hi> muſt be careful to keep a Linnen-cloath before their
faces, and that their noſtrils be well-ſtopt, leaving only two little holes
for their eyes. Beſides, they muſt every half hour be ſure to drink milk,

Yet notwithſtanding all this caution, they that have ſifted <hi>Indigo</hi> for
nine or ten days, ſhall ſpit nothing but blew for a good while toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Once I laid an Egg in the morning among the ſiſters, and when I
came to break it in the evening it was all blew within.</p>
               <p>As they take the Paſte out of the Baskets with their Fingers dipt in
Oil, and make it into Lumps, or Cakes, they lay them in the Sun to dry.
Which is the reaſon that when the Merchants buy <hi>Indigo,</hi> they burn
ſome pieces of it, to try whether there be any duſt among it. For the
Natives who take the Paſte out of the Baskets to make it into Lumps,
lay it in the Sand, which mixes with the Paſte, and fouls it. But when
the Merchants burn it, the <hi>Indigo</hi> turns to Aſhes, and the Sand remains.

               <head>Spice.</head>
               <p>CArdamom, Ginger, Pepper, Nutmegs, Nutmeg-Flowers, Cloves
and Cinnamon, are all the different ſorts of Spices known to us.
I put Cardamom and Ginger in the firſt place, becauſe that Cardamom
grows in the Territories of <hi>Viſapour,</hi> and Ginger in the Dominions of
the Great <hi>Mogul.</hi> And as for other Spices, they are brought from other
Foreign parts to <hi>Surat,</hi> which is the grand Mart.</p>
               <p>Cardamom is the moſt excellent of all other Spices, but it is very
ſcarce; and in regard there is no great ſtore in the place where it grows,
it is only made uſe of in <hi>Aſia,</hi> at the Tables of great Princes. Five
hundred pound of Cardamoms, are pric'd from a hundred to a hundred
and ten Rials.</p>
               <p>Ginger is brought in great quantities from <hi>Amadabat,</hi> where there
grows more than in any other part of <hi>Aſia;</hi> and it is hardly to be imagin'd
how much there is tranſported candited into Foreign parts.</p>
               <p>Pepper is of two ſorts. There is a ſort which is very ſmall, another
ſort much bigger; both which ſorts are diſtinguiſh'd into ſmall and great
Pepper. The larger ſort comes from the Coaſt of <hi>Malavare;</hi> and <hi>Tuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corin</hi>
and <hi>Calicut</hi> are the Cities where it is brought up. Some of this
Pepper comes from the Territories of the King of <hi>Viſapour,</hi> being vended
at <hi>Rajapour,</hi> a little City in that Kingdom. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> that purchaſe
it of the <hi>Malavares,</hi> do not give Money for it, but ſeveral ſorts of Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
in Exchange; as Cotten, Opium, Vermilion, and Quickſilver; and
this is the Pepper which is brought into <hi>Europe.</hi> As for the little Pepper
that comes from <hi>Bantam, Afchen,</hi> and ſome other parts towards the Eaſt,
there is none of it carried out of <hi>Aſia,</hi> where it is ſpent in vaſt quantities,
eſpecially among the <hi>Mahumetans.</hi> For there are double the Grains of
ſmall Pepper in one pound, to what there are of the great Pepper; beſides
that the great Pepper is hotter in the mouth.</p>
               <p>The little Pepper that comes to <hi>Surat,</hi> has been ſold ſome years for
thirteen or fourteen Mamoudi's the Mein; and ſo much I have ſeen the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> give for it, to tranſport it to <hi>Ormus, Balſara,</hi> and the Red Sea.
As for the great Pepper, which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> fetch from the Coaſt of
<hi>Malavare,</hi> five hundred pound in truck brings them in not above thirty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eight
Reals; but by the Commodities which they give in Barter, they
gain <hi>Cent. per Cent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Nutmeg, the Nutmeg-Flow'r, the Clove, and Cinnamon, are the
only Spices which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have in their own hands. The three firſt
come from the <hi>Molucca</hi> Iſlands; the fourth, which is Cinnamon, from
the Iſland of <hi>Ceylan.</hi>

'Tis obſervable of the Nutmeg, that the Tree which bears it is never
planted, which has been confirm'd to me by ſeveral perſons that have
liv'd ſeveral years in the Country. They related to me, that the Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meg
being ripe, ſeveral Birds come from the Iſlands toward the South,
and devour it whole, but are forc'd to throw it up again before it be
digeſted. The Nutmeg then beſmear'd with a viſcous matter, falling
to the ground takes root, and produces a Tree, which would never
thrive were it planted. This puts me in mind of making one obſervation
upon the Birds of Paradiſe. Theſe Birds being very greedy after Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs,
come in flights to gorge themſelves with the pleaſing Spice, at the
ſeaſon, like Felfares in Vintage time; but the ſtrength of the Nutmeg
ſo intoxicates them, that they fall dead drunk to the Earth, where the
Emets in a ſhort time eat off their Legs. Hence it comes, that the Birds
of Paradiſe are ſaid to have no Feet; which is not true however, for
I have ſeen three or four that had Feet; and a <hi>French</hi> Merchant ſent
one from <hi>Aleppo</hi> as a Preſent to <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth that had Feet; of
which the King made great account, as being a very lovely Fowl.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding all the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Projects, you may buy Cloves at
<hi>Macaſſar</hi> without purchaſing them of the <hi>Hollander;</hi> in regard the Iſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
buy them of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Captains and Soldiers, which the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
have in thoſe places where the Cloves grow, giving them in exchange
Rice, and other neceſſaries for the ſupport of life, without which they
would ſtarve, being very ſadly provided for.</p>
               <p>When the Natives of <hi>Macaſſar</hi> are thus furniſh'd of Cloves, they barter
them in Exchange for ſuch Commodities as are brought them; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they give Tortoiſe-Shells in exchange, and Gold Duſt; by which
the Merchant gains ſix or ſeven in the hundred, being better than the
Money of the Iſland, though it be Gold, by reaſon the King oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
enhances the value of it. The places where Cloves grow, are
<hi>Amboyna, Ellias, Seram,</hi> and <hi>Bouro.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Iſlands of <hi>Banda</hi> alſo, in number ſix, <hi>viz. Nero, Lontour, Poulcay,
Roſeguin,</hi> and <hi>Grenapuis,</hi> bear Nutmegs in great abundance. The Iſland
of <hi>Grenapuis</hi> is about ſix Leagues in compaſs, and ends in a ſharp point,
where there is a continual fire burning out of the earth. The Iſland
<hi>Damme,</hi> where there grows great ſtore of Nutmegs, and very big, was
diſcover'd in the year 1647, by <hi>Abel Taſman,</hi> a <hi>Dutch</hi> Commander.</p>
               <p>The Price of Cloves and Nutmegs, as I have known them ſold to the
<hi>Hollanders</hi> at <hi>Surat,</hi> was as follows.</p>
               <p>The Mein of <hi>Surat</hi> contains forty Serres, which make thirty-four of
our Pounds, at ſixteen Ounces to the Pound.</p>
               <p>A Mein of Cloves was ſold for a hundred and three Mamoudi's and
a half.</p>
               <p>A Mein of Mace was ſold for a hundred and fifty-ſeven Mamoudi's and
a half.</p>
               <p>Nutmegs for fifty-ſix Mamoudi's and a half.</p>
               <p>Cinnamon comes at preſent from the Iſland of <hi>Ceylan.</hi> The Tree
that bears it is very much like the Willow, and has three Barks. They
never take off but the firſt and ſecond, which is accounted the beſt. They
never meddle with the third, for ſhould the Knife enter that, the Tree
would dye. So that it is an art to take off the Cinnamon, which they
learn from their youth. The Cinnamon Spice is much dearer to the
<hi>Hollanders</hi> then people think; for the King of <hi>Ceylan,</hi> otherwiſe call'd
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:103159:99"/>
King of <hi>Candy,</hi> from the name of his principal City, being a ſworn
Enemy to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> ſends his Forces with an intention to ſurprize
them, when they gather their Cinnamon; ſo that they are forc'd to
bring ſeven or eight hundred men together to defend as many more that
are at work. Which great expence of theirs very much enhances the
price of the Cinnamon. There grows upon the Cinnamon Tree a
certain fruit like an Olive, though not to be eaten. This the <hi>Portugals</hi>
were wont to put into a Caldron of Water, together with the tops of
the Branches, and boil'd it till the Water was all conſum'd. When it
was cold, the upper part became a Paſte like white Wax; of which they
made Tapers to ſet up in their Churches, for no ſooner were the Tapers
lighted, but all the Church was perfum'd. Formerly the <hi>Portugals</hi>
brought Cinnamon out of other Countries, belonging to the <hi>Raja's</hi> about
<hi>Cochin.</hi> But the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have deſtroy'd all thoſe places, ſo that the
Cinnamon is now in their hands. When the <hi>Portugals</hi> had that Coaſt,
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> bought their Cinnamon of them, and uſually paid for it by the
Mein fifty Mamoudi's.</p>

Gum-Lake for the moſt part comes from <hi>Pegu;</hi> yet there is ſome alſo
brought from <hi>Bengala,</hi> where it is very dear, by reaſon the Natives
fetch that lively Scarlet colour out of it, with which they paint their
Calicuts. Nevertheleſs, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> buy it, and carry it into <hi>Perſia</hi>
for the ſame uſe of painting. That which remains after the colour is
drawn off, is only fit to make ſealing Wax. That which comes from
<hi>Pegu</hi> is not ſo dear, though as good for other Countries. The difference
is only this, that it is not ſo clean in <hi>Pegu,</hi> where the Piſmires foul it, as
in <hi>Bengala,</hi> where it grows in a heathy place, full of Shrubs, where
thoſe Animals cannot ſo well come at it. The Inhabitants of <hi>Pegu</hi> never

nothing at all induſtrious.</p>
               <p>The Women of <hi>Surat</hi> get their livings by cleanſing the Lake after the
Scarlet colour is drawn from it. After that they give it what colour
they pleaſe, and make it up into Sticks for ſealing Wax. The <hi>Engliſh</hi>

other places. I have been told it for a very great certainty, by ſeveral
ancient people in <hi>Bengala,</hi> that Sugar being kept thirty years becomes
abſolute poiſon, and that there is no Venom more dangerous, or that
ſooner works its effect. Loaf-Sugar is alſo made at <hi>Amadabat,</hi> where
they are perfectly skill'd in refining it; for which reaſon it is call'd Sugar
Royal. Theſe Sugar-Loaves uſually weigh from eight to ten pound.</p>

breadth. Every Bale may contain two hundred pieces; among
which they will juggle in five or ſix or ten, leſs fine, or leſs white, ſhorter
or narrower than according to the ſcantling of the Bale, which cannot
be found out but by examining them piece by piece. The fineneſs is
diſcern'd by the eye, the length and breadth by the meaſure. But the
<hi>Indians</hi> practiſe a more cunning way, which is to count the number of
threads which ought to be in the breadth, according to the fineneſs of
the ſcantling. When the number fails, it is either more tranſparent,
more narrow, or more courſe. The difference is ſometimes ſo difficult
to be perceiv'd, that there is no way to find it out but by counting the
threads. And yet this difference in a great quantity comes to a great
deal. For it is nothing to couſen a Crown or two Crowns in a piece
that comes but to fifteen or twenty Crowns. Thoſe that whiten theſe
Calicuts, to ſave charges of a few Limons, will knock the Calicuts
exceſſively upon a Stone, which does fine Calicuts a great injury, and
lowers the price.</p>
               <p>As for their Calicuts dy'd blew or black, you muſt take care that the
Workmen do not knock them after they are folded, to make them look
ſleek; for many times when they come to be unfolded, you ſhall find
holes in the creaſes.</p>
               <p>As for your painted and printed Calicuts, which are painted and
printed as they come out of the Loom, the Merchant muſt take care that
what he beſpeaks be finiſh'd before the end of the Rains, for the thicker
the Water is where they are waſh'd, the more lively will the printed and
painted colours appear. It is eaſie to diſtinguiſh between the printed
and the painted Calicuts; and between the neatneſs of the work: but
for the fineneſs and other qualities, they are not ſo eaſily diſcern'd; and
therefore the Broaker muſt be more careful.</p>
