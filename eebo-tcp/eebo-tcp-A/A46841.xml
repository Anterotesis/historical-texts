         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The Lord of the Manor there stood looking on, and did not in the least suppress the rude multitude, but appeared rather to countenance them.</p>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115034:5"/>
took notice of them, that they lay thick on the ground, and being smal, judged they were many thousands of them.</p>
               <p>And Secondly, The other Body or Division of the Toads, went to a Iustice of the peace his house, a little way off; and went into his Barn, to his amazement, there being by provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence also an honest man the next morning, who saw the Toads in great abundance, and heard the Iustice say, that it was a judgment upon them for suffering the boyes to abuse those ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest men in the Town, and no man can tell whence these Toads came.</p>
               <p>About a Fortnight after in the same Town, these Christians were again sorely abused, and the next Friday fortnight after, there appeared in the Lord of the Manors Orchard, a great swarme of <hi>Flyes,</hi> about the bigness of Caddus <hi>Flies,</hi> with long wings; they that saw them said they might have taken up baskets of them, and the same day also, an honest Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an man saw the Lord of the Mannors Garden covered with these <hi>Flies,</hi> in heaps like unto swarms of <hi>Bees</hi>

                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> late High Sheriff of that shire, spake with some of those parts where the Whirlewind was so dreadful, and that suffered by it. About three or four of the clock afternoon it began to be very dark with clouds, as if some very great storm were ready to come; which occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned many People about <hi>Worthington,</hi> to repair from the fields into their houses, and suddenly there arose a mighty <hi>Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind,</hi> which untiled and unthatched many of the houses in <hi>Whorthington:</hi> and thence it went to <hi>Worthington-hall,</hi> where the effects were as great or greater.</p>
               <p>It took away, or cast down several Bays of a Building there bringing down the great Barn.</p>
               <p>Also it took up a great Logg of wood from a Mill-pond, whirling it out.</p>
               <p>And so it passed on to a Wood called <hi>Springwood,</hi> where the place that it passed through, may yet be discerned, by the great trees blown down, and arms of trees, and unbarking of many trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Also thence it passed along to <hi>Tongue,</hi> which is a village near it, where also it blew down many trees, tearing some up by the roots. Amongst other things there, Major <hi>Beniskin</hi> told Mr. <hi>A. Palmer</hi> beforesaid that it took away a Hive of Bees of his, of which he could never hear since.</p>
               <p>And though there was harm to dogs, by the fall of tiles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Lord wonderfully preserved men, women and children.</p>

               <p>But such is the sad estate of this Generation, that they call good evil, and evil good (with sorrow wee speak it) taking their advantage against us in our serving the Lord.</p>

waiting upon God, by uncivil beating at our doors, and sounding of horns; yea wee have been stoned, when going to our meetings, the windows of the place where wee have been met, struck down with stones; yea taken as evil doers, and imprisoned, when peaceably met together to worship the Most High in the use of his most precious Ordinances.</p>
               <p>Wee have (O King) spread these things before them in Authority in those parts, but can have no redress from them; but the rage of our Adversaries hath been augmented by hearing us abused by some of them (in open Court) who sate on the bench of Iustice, under the odious Tearms of Knavish, Iugling, Impudent, and Phanatick Fellows, &amp;c.

                  <head>From Redding - Prison, Iuly 16. 1660. Where divers peaceable people were put, having Oaths put upon them, which they were not satisfyed to take: Of the LORDS Instructing, and comforting them, and their Relations.</head>
                  <p>OUr Lord and King, whom wee serve, hath brought us under his own pavilion, and his Banner over us hath been (and still is) Love; and hath been teaching of us these Lessons following:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:115034:13"/>
First, In the Losse of all outward things, having Christ, wee enjoy all things, and are satisfied, in the Lord, we shall take the spoiling of our goods with far more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort than the enemy will do in the spending them, for that Word in the twentieth <hi>chap.</hi> of <hi>Iob, ver.</hi> 22, 23. is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much upon our hearts concerning him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Wee hope wee have learned in whatsoever condition (wee are in) to bee therewith contented: and are perfwaded in our hearts, this is given us in, as an answer of many prayers breathed forth unto the Lord on our behalfes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That whereas formerly wee could hardly part with any thing for the Lord, wee are now made willing (by him) to part with all things, for him, and to say with good Old <hi>Ely,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 18. Its the Lord, let him do what hee pleaseth; and that in <hi>Iob</hi> 1. 23, 23. is set before us (for our Examples, upon whom the ends of the World are come) <hi>the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh, and blessed bee the name of the LORD; in all this Iob sinned not, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Wee have (since our Confinement) tasted a greater sweetness in the promises of the Lord, than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; and particularly these places following wee have had sweet experience of; <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 25. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 19. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 7. And wee can truely say by experience, That faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is hee, that hath thus promised, for hee hath also done it; Its the Lords doing, and is marvelous in our Eyes. Wee are also brought (by the power of his grace) to a more watchful srame over our Hearts, Thoughts, and Actions, by these Tryals, than formerly.</p>
                  <p>One thing, that had almost slipt our memory, the knowledge of which will (wee hope) rejoice your Hearts; that our Relations that are precious to the Lord, and to us, bear this our suffering with incomparable patience, rather singing for Ioy, than weeping for grief: also our societies from whence wee were taken, are exceeding cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and a very lively spirit of Faith and Prayer is amongst them; and their meetings rather increaseth than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115034:14"/>
Sure the Lord is neer, his wondrous works declare; for the singing of birds is come; and the <hi>Turtle</hi> is heard in our Land.</p>
                  <p>And now Brethren, for asmuch as the mercies expected, and prayed for by us, are to bee enjoyed in the way of Righteousness, it greatly concerns us, wee cry mightily to the Lord, as did his Servant of Old, <hi>Isa.</hi> 62. 1. Then shall wee have that New Name which God will give us, which is expressed in the Last verse of that Chapter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>New the God of all Peace, fill you with Peace and joy in Beleiving; so pray</hi>

                  <head>First Argument against these healths.</head>
                  <p n="1">THat which in its very best acception is but a vaine, a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Heathenish, Foolish, and Unnecessary Custome, Tradition, invented by Riotous, Drunken persons, to draw on Drunkenness and excess, must needs be sinful and utterly unlawful. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 2, 3. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 17, 18. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 20, 21. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 3, 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2. <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 11, 22. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 15, 16.</p>
                  <p>But this Drinking and Pledging of Healths, is so (as shall be proved anon) Therefore tis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>But this Drinking of healths is so, Therefore it must of necessity be sinful, and unlawful.</p>
                  <p n="3">Thirdly, That which doth pervert and cross the true end, and right, and proper use of drinking, must needs be sinful and unlawful: because it is an abuse of Gods good creatures.</p>
                  <p>But this drinking of healths, doth pervert and cross that true end. Therefore it must needs be sinful.</p>

4. That which is against the rules of Charity, and Iustice, must needs be sinful and utterly unlawful, because it is a violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law of God, of Man, and Nature.</p>
                  <p>But the Drinking of Healths, is so; because it tends for the most part both to the Temporal and Eternal hurt of those who pledge it: Therefore it must needs be sinful.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That which is Scandalous, Infamous, and of ill report a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the best and holiest Saints of God, and the better sort of Carnal Men, must needs be sinful, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 17. <hi>ch.</hi> 14. 3, 13, 15, 20, 21. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1, to 13. <hi>ch.</hi> 13. 13 32, 33. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 21. <hi>Phil.</hi> 48.</p>

                  <p>Therefore they must needs be Sinful, and unlawful.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That which doth oft times cause men to Despise, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach their Brethren without a cause, is sinful; God informs us in this case, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 3, 4, 13, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>But this Erinking of <hi>Healths</hi> is so, for if any man out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science refuse to pledge an <hi>Health,</hi> he is presently Branded, and Sentenced for a <hi>Puritan,</hi> and repined at by those who begin the <hi>Health,</hi> and they hate him in their hearts This daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, together with the Scriptures, and Fathers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>But this Drinking of <hi>Healths</hi> is sin, for it confines, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains both the Matters, the Measure, the Time, the End, and Manner of Mens Drinking, to the will of such as begin the <hi>Health,</hi> as experience testifie; therefore 'tis Sinful and Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Of which first take part of a Letter from</hi> Canterbury, August 6.</p>
                  <p>On Saturday at night fel out here a great Storm of Thunder and Lightning, and Hail, for about two hours. One Mr. <hi>Price</hi> was in the Downs, <hi>who is said to be a Purser of the Admiral,</hi> he tels that <hi>Hail-stones</hi> fell aboard their Ship in the storme, as big as <hi>Musket Bullets,</hi> and that on the Shore <hi>at Deal,</hi> it hath broken many Windows to a great dammage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another relation sent from one</hi> Mr. R. <hi>at</hi> Dover, <hi>to his Brother in</hi> London, shewing what <hi>effects that</hi> Hail <hi>had their.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Last <hi>Saturday</hi> to wit the 4th instant. from Ten at night, till two or three in the morning, was a great Thunder &amp; lightening: and such showrs <hi>of Hail,</hi> as the like was never known <hi>with us.</hi> The <hi>Hailstones</hi> were as big as <hi>Walnuts,</hi> some were measured to be 4 inches about, it hath dashed out much <hi>Corn</hi> and <hi>Fruit</hi> where it passed. <hi>Fifty pound</hi> will not mend the <hi>Glass windows</hi> in <hi>Dover,</hi> that are broken by the <hi>Hail.</hi> How far it reached I knew not, but I hear it was at <hi>Deal,</hi> as well as here, also at <hi>Folke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> where two cat tell were drove over the cliff, and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Doubless it signifies somewhat; that in the midst of <hi>Summer</hi> such <hi>Hail</hi> should be, that some affirm was more then 4. inches about.</p>
                  <p>Likewise one Mr. <hi>Fennir</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> coming to Town, relates that he spake with an honest man who was at <hi>Sandwich,</hi> and affirmed, that he measured some <hi>Hailstones,</hi> after they had lain for some time on the ground, to be <hi>Three inches</hi> about, and better. Also that the storm had done much harm to the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> Town. <hi>Thus for the relations of that Hail, which may yet more occasion our fearing of that God, and him alone, that at his pleasure by Hailstones, while-wind storms,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>can easily destroy all his and his peoples Enemies.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Consider of these Scriptures,</hi> Exo. 9. 18, to, 28. in Egypt <hi>Psalm</hi> 78. 47. <hi>He destroyed their Vines by Hail. Yea in</hi> Joshuas <hi>Wars more were destroyed by</hi> Hailstones <hi>in one battel, than by the sword,</hi> Iosh. 10. 11.</p>
