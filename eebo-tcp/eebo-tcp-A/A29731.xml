            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

may as justly answer,

is true; there are many
<pb facs="tcp:60810:10"/>
Functions so peculiar

that they are not a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but is Knowledge in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,

why thought unworthy?
Is not this the Prime rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
least the Doctrine
of the Gospell should be
tainted with Errours; and
receave impurity from
Lay mens writings; and
therefore None but Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymen,
fit to doe it. But
who sees not that this
Reason is thrust upon
<pb facs="tcp:60810:12"/>
Lay men thorough Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymens
sides? For, are all
Clergie mens writings,
free from such taynting?
Was not <hi>Origen</hi> a Clergie
man? yet how many; how
grosse Errours had their
originall and beginning
from him? Was not <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>
a Clergie man?
yet if his writings be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned
of Haeresie; hee
wil scarce be found wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to have his Clergie.
<pb facs="tcp:60810:13"/>
And not to insist upon
the Antients; (of whom
scarce One, is <hi>sine Naevo</hi>)

yet how doe his writings

of praemunire; &amp; so either
Both of them to bee Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded;
or Both of them

should It be feared, least
the Doctrine of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell

may not attaine to as

It may as iustly bee said

and their Accidens?
<pb facs="tcp:60810:14"/>
As though to attaine to
<hi>Legit ut Clericus;</hi> were the
uttermost height of a
Lay mans learning? Doth
not the whole staire case,
by which all Learning
Humane and Divine, is
ascended up by, lye open
before them? Have they
not alike Gifts of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
alike helpes of Art?
have they not as much
conference with Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men; as much plenty
<pb facs="tcp:60810:15"/>
and supply of Bookes?
have they not equall lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to study; equall will
and Desire to learne? and
indeed, what One step, in
the whole Ascent of
Learning is wanting to
them? To say; they
want yet the steppe of
taking Holy Orders; this
will prove nothing to
this purpose. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a high steppe, in
the Ascent of Sacred
<pb facs="tcp:60810:15"/>
Character; but in this
of Knowledge, It seemes
to bee no step at all. For
doth conferring of Holy
Orders, conferre any
thing to Knowledge?
If this were so: then
most likely, It should
have done it, when
Christ, a most powerfull
Agent in all hee did,
conferred Holy Orders
upon the Apostles, but
It appeares, this gave

Vnlesse we thinke

Are they commanded to

that may bee worth the

this, but to appoint God,

shall send his Presents,
Or rather, to refuse his

not by messengers, of our

no reason to exact wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

is no reason to Deny

such ability is <hi>Dos Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis,

Dowry of the Person,
<pb facs="tcp:60810:24"/>

therefore when <hi>David</hi>

but onely for the Priests:
It was not his <hi>Vnctio Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galis</hi>

            <p>Next to the worke it

If then Lay men were the

have this for their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
that Lay men shall

have reason to tye up
Lay mens handes from

their Eyes from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:
but for men that

much like, as if they

or if to have Children,
yet not to be Legitimate;
for, what is their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,

must presently be a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;

but that where the One

            <p>You will perhaps In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
that if lay-men be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to bee writers in
Diuinity; they may as
well be allowed, to bee
Assistants in Councels,
where Points of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

of a King; we should
there upon conclude him
presently to bee of the

though wee allow of lay

though wee give them
place in Theologicall

And yet even this Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of Lay men in
Councels, not perhaps
so strange a matter, as
they would make it.
Doth not <hi>Nicephorus</hi> in

And why may not the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion

in this point have its
weight: seeing it is not

laymen to bee admitted,

            <p>But why then is it said,
the Priests lips shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
Knowledge? For if
Priests be appoynted the
Keepers of Knowledge;
what have Lay men to
doe, with any thing in
their Keeping? But of
whom was this spoken?
<pb facs="tcp:60810:32"/>
was it not of Priests un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the law; who were
Priests, Borne all; not
made Priests, as Ours are?
and Knowledge might
well be then tyed to the
Priesthood; when the
Priesthood it selfe, was
tyed to one Tribe; but
now that the Priesthood
is set at liberty; and
no longer tyed to One
Tribe; now, Knowledge
also is set at Liberty; and
<pb facs="tcp:60810:33"/>
no longer tyed to the
Priesthood. And though
we bee not all Priests in
office, yet wee are all
Priests in capacity; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
capable of that
knowledge which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in Priests: and
that which Saint <hi>Peter</hi>
cals <hi>Regale Sacerdotium,</hi>
the Royall Priest-hood,
extends no lesse to lay
men, then to them of the
clergy. But chiefely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
<pb facs="tcp:60810:33"/>
It is justly said; The
lips of the Priest shall
preserve Knowledge,
because to their custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
were committed the
Bookes of the Law; and
they appoynted to Read
and expound them in
their Synagogues. But
what makes this against
Lay men now; to whom
the Bookes of the Law
and of the Gospell, lye
as open as to Clergy
<pb facs="tcp:60810:34"/>
men themselves? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

that the Teaching of
Cleargy men should be
neglected, but that
the Learning of Lay-men
should not bee
contemned. Or may wee
not conceave; It is justly
said; The lippes of the
<pb facs="tcp:60810:34"/>
Priest shall preserve
knowledge; because in
them, It is a necessary
Duty; where in Lay

It is done <hi>Ex Officie;</hi>

for that, beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by the Church:
but when hee would goe
as farre as the lips; goe
up into the Pulpit; and
Preach publikely to the
People, being yet but a
Lay man: This was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude
upon the Priestly

justly censured a Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressor:
and yet even in
this too, there were Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of that time, and

those no meane Ones

            <p>But is it not said, that
No Scripture is of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Interpretation; and
how is it not of private
Interpretation, if pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
men Interpret it?
Indeed no more, then
if Clergie men Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
it: For it is not the
<pb facs="tcp:60810:38"/>
person of the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour;
but the manner of
Interpreting, that makes
it to be private; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Cleargy man, may
make it of private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation,
if he follow
his private sense; and
have no Guide but his
owne Spirit; and a Lay
man may make it, of no
private Interpretation, if
he be guided by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of the spirit that
<pb facs="tcp:60810:38"/>
writ it. In many cases, no
doubt, the Rule upon
which to ground our
consideration, is <hi>Quis,</hi>
and not <hi>Quid:</hi> but are
there not many Cases al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
in which the Rule is
<hi>Quid,</hi> and not <hi>Quis?</hi> when
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith; <hi>Omnia

held in high account,
whose Authors yet are

and would you have
them bee rejected; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
perhaps the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of them, were but
<pb facs="tcp:60810:39"/>
Lay men? shall you not
in so doing, reiect ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
excellent Writings
of the Antient Fathers,
who writ many of their
Bookes, before ever
they entred into Holy
Orders? How much
better may that bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to Lay men here,
which Christ spake in his
owne case; if I have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ill, reprove me in it:
but if I have spoken
<pb facs="tcp:60810:40"/>
well, why doe yee strike
me? and if no man can
call God, Lord; but
by the Holy Ghost; may
wee not bee sure, that a
Treatise, orthodoxly
and piously written in
Divinity: is <hi>à Spiritu san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto;</hi>
a worke even of
God; whosoever be the
Ministeriall Author? If
Christ were <hi>Flos Horti,</hi>
a Flower of the Garden;
then indeed None but
<pb facs="tcp:60810:40"/>
Gardiners should have
Right to gather him:
but seeing he is <hi>Flos cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi;</hi>
a Flowre of the Field:
Now he lies open for all
to gather; and Gardiners
have no more Right,
nor meanes to gather
him then any other. If
the Scriptures were as
the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi>
of the Temple; into
which none might enter,
but the High-Priest; then
<pb facs="tcp:60810:41"/>
indeed we might well
thinke them to be <hi>Adyta
non adeunda;</hi> No matters
for Lay men to bee suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to meddle with: but
seeing they are as the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trium,</hi>
the common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle
of all; and that
Not onely all may come;
but to which all are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
to come; and bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
if they come not,
what should hinder, why
a Lay man being conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
<pb facs="tcp:60810:41"/>
with them, may not
be Intelligent of them; &amp;
why Meditating in them,
Day and Night, he may
not bring forth somthing
worthy of the light? It is
said to be a Tenet among
the Turkes, that their
Alcoran which is their
Scripture; is not to bee
Vnderstood by study,
but by Illumination;
and that Illumination is
proper to their Priests;
<pb facs="tcp:60810:42"/>
and never influenced
upon the Laitie; but I
hope, this Tenet for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
our Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
shall take no hold,
amongst us Christians.
To conceave that Lay
mens writing in Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
is an Affront to the
Cleargy; is the conceit
of Ioshua in his Non age;
a simple conceit; It is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Glory, and ought
to bee a Ioy unto them:
<pb facs="tcp:60810:42"/>
For what greater Ioy to
a shepheard, then to have
his Flocke thrive? what
greater Glory, to a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
then to have his
schollers prosper? and
what are Lay men to the
Cleargie, but as sheepe to
Pastors; and as Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
to Masters? who
knowes not that Clergie
men bee as Pilots in the
ship of the Church; and
worthily sit at the Helme;
<pb facs="tcp:60810:43"/>
and Is it any preiudice to
them, that Lay men bee
suffered to row at the
Oare? who doubts but
Cleargie men, are as
Captaines and Leaders
of Gods Armies: and
may not Lay men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be allowed the place
of souldiers, in fighting
Gods Battles? Cleargie
men no doubt, are the
Prime Laborers, in Gods
<pb facs="tcp:60810:43"/>
Harvest; but may not lay
men therfore be allowed
to be Gleaners? Though
Clergie men be distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of Christs whole
loaves; yet without any
Preiudice to them; Lay
men may be permitted to
gather up the Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Is it not enough,
that Lay men strike saile
to the Clergie, as they
passe by, but they must be
wholly excluded from
<pb facs="tcp:60810:44"/>
following the Fleet?
Would not <hi>Moses</hi> have
said in this Case; Envy
ye for my sake? would
God that all the Lords
People were Prophets:
that so, whilst many
bring in, to the Gazophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacium
of the Church,
though but every One a
little, a greater treasure
may sooner be gathered,
then when but a few
bring in, though Every
<pb facs="tcp:60810:44"/>
One a great deale. And
(not to beare too hard a
hand upon Lay men) Is
it not congruous that as
Clergie men are permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to doe many things,
which yet more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
belong to the Layity;
so Lay men, may bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to do some things,
which yet we may grant,
more properly to belong
to the Clergie. And have
I not now, spoken a
<pb facs="tcp:60810:45"/>
word, which with men
that are not contentious,
may justly give a period
to the Question; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
make it, without
question? For, though
Lay men be not allowed
to write in Divinity, and
to Publish their writings,
of their owne heads; yet
at least, It cannot be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed,
as a thing fit to be
permitted by superiors.
For so, all Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb facs="tcp:60810:45"/>
Pretended will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyded;
Neither Schism
will bee occasioned;
Nor Errours Creepe in;
Neither Laymen will be
Denyed the Use of their
Talents; Nor Clergie
men abridged, in the
honour of their Calling;
but all will bee done in
that decent order, which
is fit to bee Observed, in
the Israell of God; and
in the Flock of Christ.

This Restraint, of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing

of which it may
be said, <hi>Non suit Sic ab

times, and even to these
last times, both Cleargy
men; and Laymen;
might write what they
list; and Publish what
<pb facs="tcp:60810:49"/>
they writ; which perhaps
made <hi>Salomon</hi> say, <hi>Facien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di

but now at last, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Gospell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoroughly sifted,
and setled; It hath see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
good to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of the Church, to
make a Restraint; yet so,
that even those, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
not Lay men to
Reade the Scriptures
without Licence; yet
<pb facs="tcp:60810:49"/>
with Licence, allow
them to write of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and would it not
be strange, if our Church
which allowes Lay men
to Reade the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
without Licence;
should not with Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
allow them to
write?</p>
            <p>But because my selfe a
Layman, speaking for lay
men; may bee thought
partiall in the Cause;
<pb facs="tcp:60810:50"/>
or rather, because Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
have not their
strength, so much in
themselves, as from the
person that delivers
them; heare, what Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymen,
them selves say;
and what allowance they
give to Laymens writing.
Take Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> One
of the soundest Fathers,
and of the soundest
times; who though hee
have written no Treatise
<pb facs="tcp:60810:50"/>
hereof, of purpose; yet
he hath a passage in him,
that sufficiently expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
what his Opinion
is: For in his Second
Epistle, <hi>Ad Petrum pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterum
De Anima;</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
a Laymans work
in Divinity; which this
<hi>Peter</hi> had Commended
to him; he writes thus:
<hi>Absit ut erubescam Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

<pb facs="tcp:60810:51"/>
Laico, praedicanda &amp; Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanda

An humblenesse
he accounts it in a Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
man, to learne of a
Lay man; but yet an
Humblenesse, worthy
to bee praysed, and fit
to bee practised. About
his time and sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
is also Saint
<hi>Hierome</hi> who upon the
Epistle to the Colossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
<pb facs="tcp:60810:51"/>
writes thus; <hi>Hie O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenditur,

great Incitement to

Honour is the Fomenter
of Arts: and glory an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centive
to Studie: and
these indeed, are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
in Clergy men; in
Lay men Little or None
at all; but then, the Lay
man hath another In
citement more forcible
then Both these: and
that is; The Love of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and the Delight he
takes in studie; for where
<pb facs="tcp:60810:64"/>
this love is; all lab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rs
seeme easie; all time
seemes short; as was
seene in <hi>David;</hi> who,
though nothing be more
deare then Life; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
maintaines Life
but Food; yet his Love
to meditating in the
Law of God; made him
forget oftentimes to eat
his bread. This Love is
that which onely makes
the good stomacke;
<pb facs="tcp:60810:64"/>
where the digestion is
as good, as the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
is great; and each
of them makes way to
the continuance of the
other: which in the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
man commonly is not
so: For the End of his
study, being set upon pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fit
and preferment; that
profit and Preferment
once gotten, the study
abates: where the Lay
man that studies for love
<pb facs="tcp:60810:65"/>
never slacks his Inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
but the more it is
enjoyed, the more it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth.
Yet I speak not
this, as though Clergy
men may not study out
of love too; but because
Lay men have no other
Incentive of their study,
but their love: and then
is love most forcible,
when &amp; is sincere; it is
not mingled with any By

and then give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

that further Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
would bee but su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous:
that all this
while they may bee ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
said to have studied
the Politicks then Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
but the Lay man, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no end in his stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
but his study; and
seeking not Learning for
<pb facs="tcp:60810:66"/>
Preferment; but accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Learning it selfe
to bee his Preferment;
he never thinkes he hath
enough, though he have
never so much: and It
may bee said of him in
a good sense, which is
said of a Coveious man
in a bad: <hi>Quo plus bt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buntur,

the more he drinkes, the

to drinke; the more lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="tcp:60810:67"/>
hee attaines, the
more hee labours to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
more; and Now,
which of these Two, is
the likelier man to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to that height of
Learning: of whom It
may be said: <hi>Iamque ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce

Besides the Clergie
man hath many actions,
Incident to his calling,
which call him away
<pb facs="tcp:60810:67"/>
from actions of Study:
many Imployme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts which
are as rubs in his course

then by his owne choice,
as perhaps more Inclined
to some other study;
where the Lay man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
free and at liberty,
enters into it, by the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
propension of his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
and as his naturall

Inclination Leades him:
and Now, which of these
Two, is the likelier man
to attaine the greater
Perfection in Divinity;
Hee that enters into the
study, if not against his
will; at least <hi>Inuita Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva:</hi>
or Hee that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

seeke them, having had

Clergie men, that have
beene excellent schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,

yet if wee could
looke into the course of
their lives; wee should
finde, that the greatest

they got being Lay men,
as indeed the Lay mans
life is sittest for study:
the Cleargy mans for

            <p>And because the mind
is more Intentive, where
the object is more At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive;
It will not be

here, of the Excellency
and preheminence of
Divinity, that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
<pb facs="tcp:60810:70"/>
how much more
of the Adamant there
is in it then in any
other kind of Learning;
&amp; therefore no marvaile
if mens minds be drawne
unto it, with a kind of
violence; at least with
more then an ordinary
Inclination: It is true
all other kinds of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
have their severall

and Liberty of Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;

with the sweetnesse

<pb facs="tcp:60810:71"/>
though they be pleasing

in the minde a kinde of

               </gap> that the time

workes in Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
yet at last, as in a kind

them to the Fire, and
would have had them
burnt. And it is written
<pb facs="tcp:60810:72"/>
of Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> that hee

And as for Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie;
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> affords it no

thus; all human learnings
have their Remorses: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
divinity though it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
to Repentance yet
<pb facs="tcp:60810:72"/>
it never Repents: but is
the only studie, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemes
the time, and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies
her Children: And
though shee scorne not
those other Arts; Yet she
holds but little fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with then: as being
her selfe Queen: &amp; They
but Hand-maids. Againe
where all other studies
have both their use, and
delight ended in this life
and all their Characters
<pb facs="tcp:60810:73"/>
blotted out by Death,
yet the studie of Divinity
leaves in the minde a
kind of Impression, that
(as some thinke) will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be obliterate, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a beginning of that
Knowledge of God in
his word, which shall
hereafter be perfected in

makes us in this life to
Foresee the Next; and
in some measure to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb facs="tcp:60810:73"/>
of the Next: but in
a full measure, Prepares
us for the Next. In all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
studies, It is enough,
if wee observe, <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phandum,
sed Paucis;</hi> a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
proportion is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient: but in the study
of Divinity, there is no
staying at <hi>Paucis;</hi> No
stinting of proceeding:
For to make a stop, is to
take a Fall; where the
further we goe, the fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
<pb facs="tcp:60810:74"/>
way we shall find; &amp;
the greater mysteries will
be revealed. Indeed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
is in great part, if
not a Reparation, yet an
Exaltation of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
which our first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
lost, by eating the
Forbidden Fruit: and
where by eating that
Fruit, they were then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from Conversing
with God in Person; wee
by the fruit of Divinity
<pb facs="tcp:60810:74"/>
are admitted now to
Converse with him in
Spirit; and though by it'
wee come not to know
so much of the Creatures
as <hi>Adam</hi> did; yet certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we come to know more
of the Creatour then
<hi>Adam</hi> did; For by it,
we come to know the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation
of the Son of
God; a Mistery which the
Angells desired to know,
and knowing admire:
<pb facs="tcp:60810:75"/>
wee come to know the
Nature of God, which
transcends all Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks:
we come to know
the Power, of God which
transcends all Fictions of
poetry: we come to know
the wisdome of God,
which transcends all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks;
we come to know
the creation of the
World: which tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends
all Philosophy:
that wee may truly say;
<pb facs="tcp:60810:75"/>
all the Tomes of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Arts, are but Atomes
compared to this of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.
Divinity teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us Humility and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
Two vertues, which
Morall Philosophy ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
knew; It teacheth us
Obedience to the Law
of God: and submission
to his Will: Two sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
which Heathen

Divinity teacheth
<pb facs="tcp:60810:76"/>

Divinity makes
us certaine of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
of the Soule; a
Secret to which Humane
Learning never approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb facs="tcp:60810:76"/>
but with doubting;
makes us certaine of the
Resurrection of the Body
a Secret to which human
Learning never approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
so neer as doubting
Divinity makes us fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see;
that, which we cannot
see; makes us know that
which wee cannot Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend:
makes us Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
imagin. Many are the
troubles of the righteous
<pb facs="tcp:60810:77"/>
in which Estate there is
no kind of learning that
gives any comfort to the
mind but only Divinity:
for this teacheth us the
true Interpretation of
Afflictions; that they are
oftentimes as well Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of God, as Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
which no other

This world is a
Maze of Perplexities &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:60810:77"/>
Doubts: in which, there
is no other learning that
can affoord an <hi>Ariadnes</hi>
Thread to guide us, but
onely Divinity; for this
discovers to us all the
snares that are laid by
the world to entrap vs;
all the subtilties that are
used by Satan to deceave
us; which no other lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
discovers; because
none acknowledgeth. By
reason of sinne, there is

growne an Enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
God and us: in
which miserable Estate,
there is no kinde of
Learning can set the

onely Divinity: for this
assureth us, the promised
seed of the woman to
bruise the Serpents head,
the only meanes for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling
us to God;
which no other learning
can assure; because none
<pb facs="tcp:60810:78"/>
acknowledgeth: that we
may truly say, all other
learnings are but <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pundia,</hi>
Toyes to please
Children; &amp; indeed they
please us no longer, then
while we are Children in
Knowledge: as Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> saith; <hi>when I was
a Childe, I spake as a
Childe: I thought as a
Childe, I did as a Childe;
but when I came to bee a
man, I put away all
<pb facs="tcp:60810:79"/>
Childishnesse:</hi> but how to
come to bee a man in
knowledge; and how to
put away the Childishnes
of ignorance; there is no
other learning but Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
that informeth it,
because there is no other
kinde of learning, that
acknowledgeth it.</p>
            <p>The Jewes among many
their Fables of God,
have this for one; that
every day he spends cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb facs="tcp:60810:79"/>
houres in studying
the <hi>Talmud;</hi> which is
their body of Divinity;
a blasphemous Fiction,
but yet a Fiction, that
addes as much to the
honour of Divinity; as it
Derogates from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Gods Deity. He
that studies Divinity, is
continually meditating
in the Law of God; &amp; he
that doth so, is Pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

               <hi>David,</hi> but hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

Alas: for these are the

saith: <hi>Hee that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth
Knowledge en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth
sorrow;</hi> but
then hee meanes not
the Knowledge in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity;
for the more this
Knowledge encreaseth,
<pb facs="tcp:60810:80"/>
the more it fills the mind
with the true objects of
Ioy; with which, all sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
is Incompatible;
but onely that sorrow
for which wee have not,
never shall have cause
to bee sorry. If Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
were not a
thing to be Desired; the
Cherubins that are An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells
of Illumination
should not have so high
an Order, in the Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie
<pb facs="tcp:60810:81"/>
of Angels as they
have. But then it must be
a knowledge that tends
to his Glory, who is the
Fountain of Knowledge;
which no learning teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
but only Divinity.
What availes it to know
a world of secrets, if wee
know not the secret of
the world, to what end it
was made; thereby to
Glorifie him that made
it? which no learning
<pb facs="tcp:60810:81"/>
teacheth but onely Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
What would it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
us to know the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of all creatures, that
wee could give them
Names expressing their

VPON THE
Fall of LVCIFER</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Fall of
<hi>Babel</hi> was a
great Fall: for
when they had reared
the Walls above the
Clouds; and raysed them
up to the confines of
<pb facs="tcp:60810:86"/>
Heaven; even then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
tooke it, and layd
it flat with the ground;
and hath left it an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of desolation to this
day. But the Fall of man,
was a greater Fall; for
he being seated in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise;
a seate levell with
the Angells; and nothing
but God above him;
was brought down into
this vale of misery:
where he hath no better
<pb facs="tcp:60810:86"/>
a place to dwell in, then
the beasts of the field.
But the Fall of Lucifer,
as it was before, so it
was beyond both these
and exceeded them as
much in greatnesse as in
time. For where the Fall
of <hi>Babell,</hi> was but a Fall
from a higher to a
lower: and the Fall of
man, but from a better
to a worse; the Fall of
Lucifer was a fall, from
<pb facs="tcp:60810:87"/>
the highest to the lowest:
from the best to the
worst; or rather to a
lower then the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to a worse then the
worst; seeing they fell
into Hell, which had
beene no Hell, if; they
had not fallen into it for
though God made the
place, yet their fall made
the misery of the place:
which had beene none
without it. The fall of
<pb facs="tcp:60810:87"/>
               <hi>Babel</hi> was but of a pyle
of stones, reared up by
the hand of man, as it
were against their will;
and their Fall was but a
returning to the place
from whence they came;
and the Fall of man, was
but of an earthly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and but from one
part of the earth to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
a remoove ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then a fall; to a
courser part indeed, but
<pb facs="tcp:60810:88"/>
yet to a larger and of
more elbow room, then
where he was before;
and but the same out of
which, he was taken; and
therfore naturall to him:
but the fall of Lucifer,
was a fall, though not
of Heaven it selfe, yet
of a prime Creature of
Heaven: and of a
great part of the Host
of Heaven; and thatto
a place, no lesse made
<pb facs="tcp:60810:88"/>
by his fall, then for it:
and which is now the
center, or rather the
sinke of all falls, and of
all that fall: a finall,
yet endlesse fall: though
fallen, yet still falling,
because into a bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
pit.</p>
            <p>But how could Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
fall; that had such
stayes to hold him up;

Creature, that was but
only a Creature, everhad,
before or since? Guifts
of knowledge and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding;
Guifts of
strength and power:
Guifts of brightnesse and
splendour; and were
not all these Guifts, of
force sufficient to keepe
him from falling? could
not understanding make
him know the danger;
could not strength make
<pb facs="tcp:60810:92"/>
him shun the danger;
could not brightnesse
make him see the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
but that he must
fall headlong into it:
as one that had neyther
sight nor strength, nor
understanding? O my
soule, These guifts
are all excellent; but
their excellency is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
where grace is
wanting; and though
Lucifer had grace too
<pb facs="tcp:60810:93"/>
in excellency, yet he
had not, It seemes, the
excellency of grace; his
grace was inferiour to
his guifts: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as inferiour, was
overthrown by his gifts:
his understanding made
him <hi>Altum sapere;</hi> his
strength made him <hi>Altum
petere;</hi> his brightnesse,
made him <hi>Altum spirare;</hi>
so that, all these guifts,
though in themselves
<pb facs="tcp:60810:93"/>
excellent; yet having
not equall grace to wield
them: were but as so
many instruments to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
his Fall.</p>
            <p>But yet how could
Lucifer fall, that was an
Angell? seeing Angells
are spirits; and spirits are
aery and light: and have
no weight to presse them
down as bodies have:
but are borne up with
their own lightnesse as
<pb facs="tcp:60810:94"/>
with wings: though
there be nothing under
them to beare them up.
Indeed Angels being
spirits, are not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>In loco,</hi> in a place, in
the manner as bodies
are: and therefore are
not properly subject to
locall falling, as bodies
be: which is indeed a
translation rather then a
falling; as <hi>Henoch</hi> was
translated when he was
<pb facs="tcp:60810:94"/>
taken up to Heaven:
there never properly
was a falling, but this of
Lucifer and his Angells;
For this had in it, all
the parts and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
of a true fall:
It was a fall in place: for
they fell from Heaven
into Hell: a fall in estate;
for they fell from being
Angells to be Devils: a
fall in condition; for
they fel from happinesse

               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:60810:96"/>
into misery: a fall in
glory, for they fell from
light into darkenesse:
and that which is most of
all, and the cause of all,
a fall from Gods favour
to his anger; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
finally, a finall fall;
and which can never be
but a fall: for it is not
<hi>Origen</hi> can perswade us,
that a time will come;
when all the apostate
Angels, shall be restored
<pb facs="tcp:60810:96"/>
againe, to the same
estate in Heaven they
were in, at first. Indeed
man, who fell not of
himselfe, but was thrust
down by another: hath
had the favour to be ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
up by another:
but Lucifer who was not
thrust downe by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but fell of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe;
hath justly beene
left to rise of himselfe;
and seeing it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb facs="tcp:60810:97"/>
that he should rise
being fallen, who could
not stand being up; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Sedet aeternumque
sedebit, Infoelix</hi> Lucifer:
his fall is irreparable;
and no hope left of any
possibility, ever to rise
againe: and least ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the liberty of their
pryson, should give them
any hope to be in time
delivered; they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in everlasting
<pb facs="tcp:60810:97"/>
chaines under darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
unto the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the great day:
the day of which they
sayd to Christ; <hi>Art thou
come</hi> to torment us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our time? Not that
they were without tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
then; but that they
had it not, in the full
measure.</p>
            <p>O Lucifer, why wouldst
thou fall, when thou
mightst have stood!
<pb facs="tcp:60810:98"/>
though I cannot say,
thy will was to fall, but
to rise: but that will
of thine to rise, was a
just cause of thy fall; for
why shouldst thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to rise higher, who
wert as high already as
the Highest, but onely
the Highest! could no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
serve thy turne, but
to be equall with God,
who should not be God,
if hee could have an
<pb facs="tcp:60810:98"/>
equall? what was this
but extreme pride? and
if it be true that pride
will have a fall; and a
fall proportionable to
the pride: there never
was such a pride: and
therefore never such a
fall. The pride extreme:
and therefore extreme
the fall.</p>
            <p>But how could such
pride enter into the
mind of Lucifer, to have
<pb facs="tcp:60810:99"/>
emulation with God?
To be proud in emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with men, may have
some colour: because
we can see defects in
them; and will see none
in our selves: but to be
proud with God; seemes
a thing impossible: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is nothing to
be seen in God, that is
not perfecter then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
it selfe. But the
truth is, It is the nature
<pb facs="tcp:60810:99"/>
of pride to infatuate:
and to make one see
lesse in others; more in
ones selfe, then there is:
and this was Lucifers
case. He could not but
know, that whatsoever
he had: he had it from
God; but hee might
thinke perhaps, that
God had over spent
himselfe in giving, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was a ware, and
had given him greater
<pb facs="tcp:60810:100"/>
gifts then he left for
himselfe: and upon this,
might take upon him to
be as great as he: when
he thought himselfe to
be as good as he. But
O Lucifer, if this were
thy thought, we may
justly thinke, thy wit as
little as thy grace: For
though it be s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yd of the
Sonne of God, that
<hi>Exinanivit seipsum;</hi> he
emptied himselfe; yet
<pb facs="tcp:60810:100"/>
but as sonne, not as God:
but that remaines entire
still; and can suffer no
abatement, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
any greatnesse
of gifts, he imparts to
any other. Indeed there
is not in the World a
more foolish thing then
pride; which will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
be climing, when
nothing is so unsit to
climbe as it: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to use any Ladder at
all; and indeed there is
no Ladder, to reach so
high as Lucifer aspired;
For the longest Ladder
of Creatures reacheth
but to Heaven; and he
aspired to be as high as
God, who is above the
<pb facs="tcp:60810:104"/>
Heavens. But as bodies
are held up, by some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is under them:
so spirits are held up by
something that is above
them; and that somthing
above them, is the hand
of God: who if once he
give over his hold; (and
he gives over his hold,
where he sinds there is
pride:) how can proud
spirits chuse but fall,
when they have nothing

up? not under them;
because they are not bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
Not above them;
because they are not
humble.</p>
            <p>It may bee thought,
that Lucifer was not
much discontented with
his fall, seeingby his fall,
he got to be Prince, the
Prince that ruleth in the
Ayre. He might have
<pb facs="tcp:60810:106"/>
stayed long enough in
heaven before he should
have gotten such a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty;
and if this bee a
fall, what is a prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
For though the
Ayre be a meaner Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
then Heaven; yet
to be a Prince in it, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
him better, then to
be a subject in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For he is all for
soveraignty: of his mind
that sayd; <hi>Aut Caesar, aut
<pb facs="tcp:60810:107"/>
Nihil:</hi> if he see but one
above him; he takes no
joy, how many soever
he sees below him: But
alas what availes it to
have the title of a prince,
and not the power? For
what power hath Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer
in the aire, when
all his walke, is but to
compasse the Earth; and
can doe nothing there
neither; not so much as
enter into Swine, but
<pb facs="tcp:60810:107"/>
as hee is faine to aske
leave of God. O then
the vanity of pride, that
pleaseth it selfe with
titles, where there is no
Power. But Lucifer is
of another mind; For if
once he get but the title,
It shall goe hard, but
he will quickly get the
power too: and for all
his fall, is not out of
hope to attaine his end.
For though hee cannot
<pb facs="tcp:60810:108"/>
rob God of his worship;
yet of his worshippers
he can and will: that
if the matter should
come to bee tryed by
number; he would not
doubt to have more fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
to take his part,
then God: and then,
this is glory enough for
him, to be equall with
God in number of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
though he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee in power; and
<pb facs="tcp:60810:108"/>
in deed if it be true, that
in Heaven hee drew as
many after him, as he
left behind him; he is
like to make it good in
Earth with advantage;
where for one that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres
to God; I cannot
say how many, but many
adhere to him, and this
was plainly seene at the
time of the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge;
For there entred
then into the Arke but
<pb facs="tcp:60810:109"/>
eight persons; and all
entred that were the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of God: all the
rest of the World: and
the World was then as
full of people as now;
were all, for any thing
appeares, the servants of
Lucifer. But in what
aire is it, that Lucifer is
a Prince? Is it any where
but in aery and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
minds, caried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
with every winde,
<pb facs="tcp:60810:109"/>
and in whom there is
no stability of grace? and
to bee a Prince in such
ayre what is it but to be
an aery Prince? with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any solidnesse or
substance in him; all in
phantasmes and shewes;
as he shewed Christ, all
the Kingdomes of the
World: but it was but
a shew; and he shewed
<hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>Saul;</hi> but that
but a shew too; and his
<pb facs="tcp:60810:110"/>
enchanters turned their
rods into Serpents: and
that but a shew neither;
for indeed all the power
he hath: and all hee
can doe as Prince of the
Aire, is but to make a
shew; great promises;
and great threatings, but
all vanish into Aire;
and therefore this but
a poore amends for the
misery of his fall; seeing
his Principality<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, is but
<pb facs="tcp:60810:110"/>
a seeming Dominion:
where his Fall is a
sensible and reall servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
            <p>If you aske at what
time it was that Lucifer
fell; there be some will
tell you, before the
making of the World:
but this could not bee:
seeing there was neyther
<hi>Vnde</hi> nor <hi>Quo:</hi> neyther
place from whence nor
<pb facs="tcp:60810:111"/>
place, whither he should
fall, till God had made
the Heaven and the
Earth. Others there are
will say; Vpon the first
day of the Creation:
because then, God made
the light: and the
Angells are sayd to bee
Angells of light: and if
made then; they also
fell then: for they sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
assoone as they were
made: and fell assoone
<pb facs="tcp:60810:111"/>
as they sinned. But most
likely it is, they fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the second day of
Creation; which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
made <hi>Moses</hi> not to
say of the worke of the
second day, that God
saw, It was good: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in that day God
saw something, that was
not good; and nothing
so likely, as the pride
of Lucifer, and his fall.
But whensoever it was
<pb facs="tcp:60810:112"/>
that he fell; whether
sooner or later; It was
too soone for us, seeing
hee was ready heere on
Earth to seduce us; as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soone
as we were made;
as hee had seduced o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
before in Heaven,
assoone as he was made
himselfe; to the end
belike, that none should
be longer innocent, then
he himselfe had beene:
For <hi>Inveritate non stetit:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:60810:112"/>
Hee stayed not one jot
of time, before he playd
his prankes in Heaven.
He never stayed for <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundae
cogitationes:</hi> For
if hee had stayed but so
long as to bethink him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe;
could hee have
beene so blind, not to
see his errour, or so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provident,
not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
his fall? Oh the
wonderfull dammage
that is incurred by hasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb facs="tcp:60810:113"/>
and precipitancy.
Not Lucifer with all his
gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts, but hastinesse
brought upon him, his
miserable fall, and utter
ruine.</p>
            <p>And as it is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
at what time hee
fell; so it is as uncertaine
to what place hee fell:
though no doubt, into
Hell, if there be a Hell;
but if there bee none,
whither then? and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb facs="tcp:60810:113"/>
where should any
such place be? we are
sure, Not in Heaven;
For then it should have
beene no fall; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
Heaven and Hell
are not onely asunder,
but <hi>opposite.</hi> And wee
may be sure, not in the
Sea; For then there
could be no Hell fire for
water, and besides, <hi>Dives</hi>
would never have made
such moane, for a drop
<pb facs="tcp:60810:114"/>
of water to coole his
tongue. It might bee
thought to bee in the
Aire; because hee is said
to be the Prince that
ruleth in the Aire: but
that when <hi>Corah</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>
went downe quick
into Hell: they were
swallowed up of the
Earth, and not of the
Aire. And yet neither
can Hell be in the earth,
seeing the Earth is a
<pb facs="tcp:60810:114"/>
solid body; and not
likely to have any cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
so large to make a
Hell; which must bee
able to hold all the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the damned, that
ever were, or shall bee;
and indeed if there were
any such place as Hell;
would <hi>Moses</hi> have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
it in his catalogue
of Creation? and seeing
he makes no mention of
any such place, we may
<pb facs="tcp:60810:115"/>
well thinke there is no
such place: but that it
is only a fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tion of Poets;
of whom it is truly said;
<hi>Admiranda canunt, sed
non credenda Poetae.</hi> Thus
argue some infidell spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
that would be glad
there were no such
place as Hell, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
speak as they would
have it: but the reasons
of their infidelity may
be easily confuted. For,
<pb facs="tcp:60810:115"/>
why is there no such ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
in the earth to make
a Hell; when by evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
demonstration it is
prooved, that the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Earth is no
lesse then seaven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
miles; and may not
so vaste a space afford
roome sufficient for a
Hell: and for a Hell suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to hold all the
soules of the damned;
that ever were or shall
<pb facs="tcp:60810:116"/>
be; when the body of
one man was able to
hold a legion which is at
least six thousand devils;
and divells take up as
much roome as soules?
For as for the bodies of
the damned, there needs
no roome in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Hell for
them; (unlesse now and
then perhaps, for two or
three such as <hi>Korah</hi> and
<hi>Dathan)</hi> untill the day
of judgement: For bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb facs="tcp:60810:116"/>
come not there till
then: and then there wil
be a new Heaven, and
a new Earth: and no
doubt a new Hell too;
at least, the old Hell so
much enlarged, as to be
able to hold as well the
bodies of the damned,
then, as now the soules;
of which enlarging of
Hell, the Prophet <hi>Fsay</hi>
sayth thus; <hi>Hell hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged

opened her mouth exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly:</hi>
as if it were the
condition of Hell, to
grow alwayes greater
with the occasion; and
therefore no neede to
feare, it will ever be too
little. And what though
<hi>Moses</hi> make no mention
of any such place as Hell;
doth it therefore follow,
there is no such place?
He makes no mention of
Angells neither, shall
<pb facs="tcp:60810:117"/>
we therefore thinke,
there are no Angells? But
as he forbeares to speake
of these persons: so he

for one reason; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his purpose is to

of these is any. But
though <hi>Moses</hi> make no

yet there are others that

doe; and others as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

then our Creed:
doth not an Apostle
make it an article: that

In which point,
God hath been so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident;
that although
the Devill sinned from
<pb facs="tcp:60810:120"/>
the beginning; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

O my soule, be most

which Lucifer and his
angells fell; and in which
both he and all that be
his adherents, which are
all impenitent sinners;
shall everlastingly be
detained and everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
be tormented: but
where or how it is, who
can tell, or how should
we know, when it is not
revealed?</p>
            <p>But in what was it,
that Lucifer shewed his
<pb facs="tcp:60810:121"/>
pride towards God? was
it in contesting with him
about his soveraignty?
Or was it, in finding fault
with his Creation of the
World; or with his
government in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?
and then, was it
in word, or in deed; or
but in thought only? som
indeed have thought but
only in thought: but
this is not likely; for
<pb facs="tcp:60810:121"/>
could he, by only think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
have drawn such
multitudes of Angels, as
he did, into his facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
some againe have
thought, he tooke it in
skorn at Gods Hands:
that his Son should take
upon him the nature of
man; and not of Angells;
wherein hee thought
himselfe disparaged; and
thereupon grew mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
and rebellious
<pb facs="tcp:60810:122"/>
against God: but neithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
is this likely: for that
secret of Christs incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
was not perhaps
as yet discovered, when
Lucifer offered his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
to God. Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it was; It was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
that God saw in
him an insolent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
disposition, with
which, by communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he had infected
many; and who knowes
<pb facs="tcp:60810:122"/>
to what it might have
grown, if God had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
him never so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
to have stayd in
Heaven?</p>
            <p>But how should Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer
come to sin, being
created in so great Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
as no doubt he
was? was it not, that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himselfe in state of
immortality, he knew he
could never perish; and
the knowing he could
<pb facs="tcp:60810:123"/>
not perish, made him
stand upon himselfe; and
admiring his own gifts,
neglect the giver? For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
it is as impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to conceave, how he
<hi>should</hi> ever come to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit
sin, being created in such
holinesse; as to conceave
how there should be sin,
for him to commit, when
there was no such thing as
sin created. It seems ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he created it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>fe:
<pb facs="tcp:60810:123"/>
which perhaps
Christ meant, when he
said; <hi>Diabolus est mendax
&amp; Pater ejus;</hi> the Devill
is a lier; and the Father
&amp; creatour of lies. For he,
seeing God to be a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour:
and knowing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
made <hi>Ad similitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
Dei;</hi> after Gods like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
thought perhaps,
he might lawfully doe
as he saw God doe: and
be a creatour as well as
<pb facs="tcp:60810:124"/>
he: And why not bee
<hi>Similis Altissimo:</hi> like
to the most high; being
made, <hi>Ad similitudinem
Altissimi:</hi> after the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the most High?
upon which false ground
seeking to bee like God
in soveraignty; where
he should have sought to
be like him in holinesse:
he became as it were the
creatour of sinne; For
alas, what other creature
<pb facs="tcp:60810:124"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ould he make, if hee
would needs be making
creatures, being a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
himselfe, but onely
sinne? that now, as God
sayd afterward of <hi>Adam</hi>
as it were in skorn: <hi>Man
is become like one of us,
knowing good and evill:</hi>
so of Lucifer, he might
say in skorn; Lucifer is
become like one of us
being a soveraigne, and
a maker of Creatures.
<pb facs="tcp:60810:125"/>
But as sin was at first, as
it were the Creature of
Lucifer; so Lucifer is
now as it were the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of sin; for what is
there in him, which si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
hath not made? all that
God made in him being
utterly defaced: and this
was a greater fall, then
that which was locall;
for that, though from
the highest to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
was yet but a finite

               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>race to sin; from being
a Creature of God, to be
a Creature of sin; was a
fall as Infinite, as sinne it
selfe, which next to the
infinitnesse of him that
is infinitnesse it selfe, is
infinite.</p>
            <p>But why would God
so severely punish a first
offence; and of a first of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendour;
and of one
that knew not what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
<pb facs="tcp:60810:126"/>
meant; and
had never had example,
to make him take heed?
was it not that this first
sinne, should not have
beene the last, if the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendour
had been suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to scape unpunished!
and therefore was not
more a punishment, then
a prevention. And could
any severity be too great
in punishing an offence
so insolent; an offendour
<pb facs="tcp:60810:126"/>
to impenitent? For doe

and perhaps of their fin

Ghost; shall never be

world, or in the world to

be made of this,
in this case of Lucifer?
May we not say, that in
God the Father, is consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

power; as we say
<pb facs="tcp:60810:131"/>
in our creed: <hi>I believe in
God the Father Almighty;</hi>
&amp; to sin against power is
a sin of infirmity: and this
sin shall be forgiven: In
God the Son is conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
wisdom; as it is said;
<hi>In Christ are all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
hidden of wisdom and
knowledge;</hi> and to sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
wisdom, is a sin of
ignorance: and this shall
be forgiven: but in God
the holy Ghost, is consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb facs="tcp:60810:131"/>
love; as it is said;
<hi>The love of God is shed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
in our hearts by the
holy Ghost:</hi> and to sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
love is a sin of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice:
and this shall never
be forgiven. O wretched
Lucifer; we may then
conclude, thy sin as being
of malice, is absolutely
irremissible: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thy fall, as an effect
of that sin, is utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverable:
that it is
<pb facs="tcp:60810:132"/>
but labour in vaine, for
Origen to plead for thy
pardon any longer; <hi>For,</hi>
though there might bee
hope of pardon for they
sin of pride; as being
against the Father, &amp; the
Son: yet for thy sin of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
there can be no hope
at all, as being directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>And now my soule,
wonder not that Lucifer
fell: but wonder rather,
<pb facs="tcp:60810:132"/>
that thou fallest not thy
selfe: for how much dost
thou come short of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifers
aspiring? he sought
to be Gods equall: and
thou thinkest much to
be his inferiour: For why
else dost thou vilify his
Lawes; set at nought his
Commandements: and
makest no more recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his precepts, then
if they were the words of
an idoll? Is it not as much
<pb facs="tcp:60810:133"/>
not to obey God; as not
to acknowledge him? is
it not as great an indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
to vilifie his word, as
his person? O accursed
Lucifer, though we may
curse thee for all this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill;
yet there is some
good for which we may
thanke thee, that by this
dreadfull example of thy
fall, we may learne to
humble our selves under
the Almighty hand of
<pb facs="tcp:60810:133"/>
God; and to serve him
with feare; least we take
the like fall, as thou hast
done: for if God spared
not the Angells that
were disobedient: why
should we thinke he will
spare us? only O blessed
Saviour, It must be thy
worke to stand between
us, and thy fathers anger:
that he leave us not to
our selves: as hee did
Lucifer and his angells;
<pb facs="tcp:60810:134"/>
For alas then, we shall
never be able to escape
falling with Lucifer
and his Angells.</p>
