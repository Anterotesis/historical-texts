            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THAT a Discourse of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture should be addrest to Your Ladyship, if it seems extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, it ought to argue a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more than common in Her who is chiefly entitled to the perusal of it.

from the imputation of inability for such performances, and condemning the greatest part of ours, is indeed a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if we consider the Generality of the world; but none at all if we consider Your self. Blush not, Madam, You are not singular in this: Many other excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Heroinae</hi> begin to get above their dull circumstances and the vogue of the World, and own the glorious reproach of entertaining their best faculty, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, about the most noble and most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Subjects. The high value you have for the sacred inviolableness of <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> Your earnest desire to render Faith lively and efficacious in your self, by making out more and more to your thoughts how absolutely certain the Grounds of it are; the Confidence You have in Gods Goodness not to deny us a clear, easie, and short way to make manifest this Certainty to our selves, and others; These good dispositions of Your Will, give Your excellent Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing such an attentiveness to the
<pb facs="tcp:31244:4"/>
Proofs Faith stands under, that I had fail'd your expectation, and writ in a way much below You, had I taken any other than I have here done; that is, to begin with the <hi>bottom-Principles,</hi> and <hi>derive</hi> thence by a continued line of <hi>consequences</hi> my main <hi>Conclusion.</hi> Had I produc'd Scripture-proofs, or Quotations from any Authority of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers or Councils to evince the Point in hand, Your piercing wit would have made this smart demand in behalf of my Readers, that since none of those is a <hi>First Principle,</hi> and so evident to all that heat them alledg'd, I ought for their satisfaction make out by evident Reason, that my Interpretation of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture could not fail to hit upon the right sence, or those Authorities possibly mistake or mislead; since <hi>no Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty deserves any Assent farther than Reason gives it to deserve:</hi> So that still I was forc'd, if I would appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore You, to take this very Method I have here pursued; that is, to suppose
<pb facs="tcp:31244:4"/>
nothing, but prove all things that can possibly be questioned in this affair.</p>
            <p>As for the following Discourse, I only say, that I could heartily wish Learned Writers of what Judgement soever, would think fit to take the <hi>same</hi> short concluding Method, and go about to settle some <hi>other</hi> Ground or Rule of Faith; and thence, by shewing who adhere to, who reject that Rule, conclude evidently <hi>who are</hi> truly Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, <hi>who not.</hi> The very attempting this, would perhaps more readily disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver on whose side Truth stands, than many Books writ controver sially by way of mutual opposition; where an obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Adversary may at pleasure still mistake wilfully every passage to make his impugnation the easier. The main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of all Errors are, as Experience teaches, very free of <hi>opposition,</hi> but only they who have certain Truth on their <hi>side</hi> will think fit to <hi>settle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will be wonder'd at, Madam, that I make no farther discovery of Your

Person and Quality; but You have will'd the contrary. The Obedience to which Command, obliges me by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to conceal my own Name, and only to put instead of It, the Title of my being,</p>

            <head>THE METHOD To arrive at SATISFACTION IN RELIGION.</head>
            <p n="1">1. SInce all <hi>Superstructures</hi> must needs be weak whose <hi>foundation</hi> is not, surely laid; He who desires to be satisfy'd in Religion, ought to begin with searching out, and establishing the <hi>Ground</hi> on which Religion is <hi>built;</hi> that is, the <hi>First Principle</hi> into which the several Points of <hi>Faith</hi> are <hi>resolv'd,</hi> and on which their <hi>Certainty,</hi> as to us, depends.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:31244:6"/>
2. To do this, 'tis to be consider'd, that <hi>a Church</hi> is a <hi>Congregation of Faithful,</hi> and <hi>Faithful</hi> are those who have <hi>true Faith;</hi> Wherefore, till it be known which is the <hi>true Faith,</hi> it cannot be known which is the <hi>true Church.</hi> Again, <hi>A Council</hi> is a <hi>Representative,</hi> A <hi>Father,</hi> an <hi>Eminent Member of the Church, and a witness of her Doctrine;</hi> Wherefore, till it be known which is the <hi>true Church,</hi> it cannot be known which is a <hi>Council,</hi> or who a <hi>Father. Lastly,</hi> Since we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know which is <hi>Scripture,</hi> but by the testimony of those who recommend it; And of <hi>Hereticks</hi> we can have no secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:31244:6"/>
that they have not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted it in favour of their false Tenets; Neither can we be secure which is <hi>Scripture,</hi> till <hi>we</hi> be satisfy'd who are the <hi>truly Faithful,</hi> on whose Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony we may safely relie in this affair.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Wherefore, he who sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely aims at <hi>Satisfaction in Religion</hi> ought first of all to find out and establish some <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured Means</hi> or <hi>Rule</hi> by which he may be secured, which is <hi>true Faith;</hi> For, till this be done, He cannot be secure ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Scripture, Church, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> or <hi>Father;</hi> but having once done this, is in a ready way to judge certainly of all; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31244:7"/>
if he begin with any of the other, orindeed argue from them at all, till the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> be first settled, he takes a wrong Method, and breaks the Laws of Discourse, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with what is less cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and indeed to him as yet <hi>uncertain;</hi> and in effect, puts the <hi>Conclusion</hi> before the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises;</hi> unless he argue, <hi>Ad Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem,</hi> or against the personal Tenets of his Adversary, which is a good way to <hi>Confute,</hi> but not to <hi>Satisfie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. And, because the <hi>Rule of faith</hi> must be known before <hi>Faith</hi> can be known, and <hi>Faith</hi> before <hi>Scripture, Church, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi> and <hi>Fathers;</hi> it appears,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:31244:7"/>
that to the finding out this <hi>Rule</hi> no assistance of <hi>Books</hi> will be requisite, for every one who needs <hi>faith,</hi> is not capable to Read and understand <hi>Books:</hi> There is left then only <hi>Reason</hi> to use in this Inquiry; And, since People of <hi>all Capacities</hi> are to be saved, much <hi>sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>depth</hi> of <hi>wit</hi> will not be requisite, but <hi>plain Natural Reason</hi> rightly directed will suffice.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This being so, the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod</hi> of seeking <hi>satisfaction in Religion,</hi> is become strangely both more <hi>short</hi> and <hi>easie.</hi> For, here will need no tedious turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over <hi>Libraries,</hi> nor learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Languages,</hi> nor endless
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:31244:8"/>
               <hi>comparing</hi> voluminous <hi>Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> nor so much as the skill to read <hi>English,</hi> all being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to the considering <hi>one single Point</hi> (But such an one as bears all along with it) And this too comprehensible, (as will appear) to a <hi>mean</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. Again, the large deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>particular</hi> Points in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversial way is by this means avoided. For, when the <hi>Right Rule of faith</hi> is <hi>certainly</hi> known, then as certainly as there is <hi>any faith</hi> in the world, all that is received on <hi>that Rule</hi> is <hi>certain,</hi> and of <hi>faith.</hi> Not but that 'tis of excellent use too, to cherish and strengthen the <hi>faith,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of <hi>Young Believers,</hi> by
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:31244:8"/>
shewing <hi>each particular Point</hi> agreeable to <hi>right Reason</hi> and <hi>Christian Principles,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded expressly in, or dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by consequence from the <hi>Divinely-inspired Books.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Lastly. <hi>This Method</hi> is particularly suitable to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>sincere Inquirers;</hi> who if they want the <hi>liberty</hi> of their own Native <hi>Indifferency,</hi> and be aw'd by any <hi>Authority</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever before that <hi>Authority</hi> be made out, cannot but remain unsatisfyed, and inwardly feel they proceed not according to <hi>Nature</hi> and the conduct of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byast Reason;</hi> Whereas, when the Authority is once made <hi>evident,</hi> Reason will <hi>cleerly</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:31244:9"/>
them that it becomes their Nature to assent to it.</p>
            <p n="7">7. But how will it appear that 'tis so <hi>easily</hi> determinable by <hi>common reason,</hi> which is the <hi>right Rule of Faith?</hi> Very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently. But first we must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, the Assent called <hi>Faith,</hi> depends upon two Propositi- <hi>[What God hath said is true]</hi> and <hi>[God hath said this]</hi> out of which two necessarily follows the <hi>Conclusion,</hi> that <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> in particular is true. Of these two we are concerned onely in the latter: For to examin <hi>Why God is to be believed</hi> when he has said any thing which they call the <hi>formal Motive of faith,</hi> is not a Task for those

who own <hi>Christianity.</hi> But all we have to do is to find out <hi>What God hath said,</hi> or (which in our case is all one) <hi>What Christ has taught;</hi> and that, vvhatever it be vvhich ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us vvith this, we call <hi>THE RULE OF FAITH;</hi> as that vvhich <hi>Regulates</hi> our belief concerning <hi>Christs Doctrine,</hi> or the <hi>Principles of Religion.</hi> Now I affirm it may by <hi>obvious Reason</hi> be discover'd vvhich this <hi>Rule</hi> is; and that by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the <hi>Nature</hi> of it, or considering <hi>what kind</hi> of thing it ought to be; vvhich is no more than attentively to reflect vvhat is meant by those two <hi>ordinary</hi> vvords, RULE and FAITH.</p>

8. And both of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us that the <hi>Rule of faith</hi> must be the means to <hi>assure us in fallibly</hi> vvhat Christ taught. For, in case a <hi>Rule,</hi> though we <hi>apply</hi> it to our povver, and <hi>swerve</hi> not from it, leave us still <hi>deceivable</hi> in those points in vvhich it should regulate us; vve need <hi>another Rule</hi> to secure us that vve be not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deceiv'd, and so this <hi>other</hi> and not the <hi>former</hi> is our <hi>Rule.</hi> Next, <hi>Faith</hi> (speaking of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> Faith) differs from <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> in this, that <hi>opinion</hi> may be <hi>false,</hi> but <hi>faith</hi> cannot: Wherefore <hi>the Rule of faith,</hi> both as 't is a <hi>rule,</hi> and as it grounds <hi>faith,</hi> doubly involves <hi>Infallibility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:31244:10"/>
9. Let us apply this to <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Tradition,</hi> (for setting aside the <hi>Light of the private Spirit</hi> grounding <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticism,</hi> there are no more which claim to be <hi>Rules of faith)</hi> and see to <hi>which</hi> of them this Notion <hi>fits;</hi> that is, which hath truly <hi>the Nature of the Rule of faith.</hi> And this is perform'd by examining <hi>which</hi> of them <hi>is of its own Nature, if apply'd and held to, able to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure us infallibly, that Christ taught thus and thus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. And for the <hi>Letter of Scripture,</hi> not to insist that if it be <hi>deny'd,</hi> as <hi>many,</hi> if not all the parts of the <hi>New Testament</hi> have been by some or other,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:31244:11"/>
or mention that those who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Books,</hi> do often and always may doubt of almost <hi>any</hi> particular Text alledged, whether some fault through <hi>Malice, Negligence</hi> or <hi>weakness</hi> be not crept into it; in which Cases the <hi>Letter</hi> cannot evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it self, but needs <hi>another</hi> Rule to establish it. I say, not to insist upon these things, which yet are undeniable, We see by experience <hi>Multitudes</hi> of Sects differing from one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and <hi>some</hi> in <hi>most funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Points,</hi> as the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and <hi>Godhead</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> yet all agreeing in the <hi>outward Letter.</hi> And it is not onely uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but even impossible to

imagine that <hi>none</hi> among so <hi>vast Multitudes</hi> do intend to <hi>follow</hi> the <hi>Letter to their power,</hi> while they all profess to <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> it as much as any, <hi>read</hi> it frequently, <hi>study</hi> it diligently, <hi>quote</hi> it constantly, and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously defend the <hi>sense</hi> which they conceive of it, so far that many are even ready to die for it; Wherefore it cannot be suspected but they <hi>follow it to their power;</hi> and yet 'tis so far from <hi>infallibly</hi> teaching them the Doctrine of Christ, that, all this notwithstanding, they contradict one another, and that in <hi>most fundamental points.</hi> The bare <hi>Letter</hi> then <hi>is not the Rule of Faith,</hi> as not being of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:31244:12"/>
its own Nature <hi>able to assure us infallibly, though we follow it to our power, what Christ has taught.</hi> I would not be mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to have <hi>less</hi> Veneration than I ought for the <hi>Divine Books,</hi> whose <hi>Excellence</hi> and <hi>Usefulness</hi> as it is beyond man to express, so peradventure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men there are not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who conceit this deeper than my self; and I am sure not one amongst those who take the confidence to charge us with such irreverent thoughts: But we are now about another <hi>Question.</hi> They are the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and their <hi>true Sense</hi> is <hi>Faith;</hi> We are enquiring out <hi>the Rule of</hi>

               <hi>Faith;</hi> whose office 'tis not to <hi>satisfie</hi> us that <hi>we ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what God has said,</hi> which none doubts of, but <hi>What it is which God has said.</hi> And I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, <hi>That the Letter alone is not a sufficient means to assure us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly of this;</hi> and the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of so many erring Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, is a lamentable, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing proof of it.</p>
            <p n="11">11. On the other side, there needs but common sense to discern, <hi>That</hi> TRADITION <hi>is able, if follow'd to ones pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to bring infallibly down to after Ages, what Christ and his Apostles taught at first.</hi> For, since it means no more but delivery of Faith by dayly
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:31244:13"/>
Teaching and Practise of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Forefathers to their respective Children; and it is not possible that men should be <hi>ignorant</hi> of that to which they were <hi>educated,</hi> of that which they <hi>dayly saw,</hi> and <hi>heard,</hi> and <hi>did;</hi> let this Rule be <hi>follow'd to ones power,</hi> that is, let Children resolve still to believe and practise themselves what they were taught by, and practis'd with their Fathers, and this from Age to Age; and it is impossible but all succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Children which <hi>follow</hi> this Rule, must needs from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles time to the end of the World, be <hi>of the same Faith</hi> which was taught at first; For,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:31244:13"/>
while they do thus, there is <hi>no change;</hi> and, if there be <hi>no change,</hi> 'tis <hi>the same. Tradition</hi> then, thus understood, has in it the Nature of <hi>the Rule of Faith,</hi> as being <hi>able, if held to, to bring down infallibly what Christ and his Apostles taught.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12 We have found <hi>the Rule of Faith,</hi> there remains to find which body of men in the World <hi>have ever,</hi> and <hi>still do follow this Rule.</hi> For, <hi>those,</hi> and <hi>onely those,</hi> can be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly assured of what Christ taught, that is, can <hi>onely</hi> have <hi>true Faith:</hi> Whereas <hi>all the rest,</hi> since they have but <hi>fallible grounds,</hi> or a Rule for their Faith, which <hi>may deceive them,</hi>

cannot have <hi>right Faith,</hi> but <hi>Opinion</hi> onely; which <hi>may be false,</hi> whereas Faith <hi>cannot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13.

               <hi>Church</hi> hold <hi>not</hi> their Faith by the Tenure of <hi>Tradition,</hi> but rather acknowledg by their carriage that <hi>Tradition</hi> stands <hi>against</hi> them; and that 'tis their <hi>Interest</hi> to renounce it, lest it should overthrow their Cause; Wherefore, since <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> [§. 11.] <hi>is the only means to derive Christs Doctrine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly down to after ages,</hi> they, by renouncing it, renounce the onely means of conveying the Doctrine of Faith certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to us, and are <hi>convinc'd</hi> to have <hi>no faith,</hi> but onely <hi>opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And not onely so, but even to <hi>oppose</hi> and go point-blank <hi>against</hi> it, since they oppose the <hi>onely-sure Method</hi> by which

it can with certainty come down to us.</p>
            <p n="14">14.

            <p n="16">16. I say <hi>Notorious;</hi> for, since <hi>Points of Faith</hi> which ground all <hi>Christian practise,</hi>

are the most <hi>concerning</hi> Truths in the World, it cannot be but the <hi>denyal</hi> of <hi>such</hi> Truths must needs raise great commotions before the opposite Tenets could be universally spread; and the change of Christian <hi>Practise</hi> and <hi>Manners</hi> which depend on those Truths, must be wonderfully manifest and known to every body; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, had <hi>we</hi> been guilty of <hi>such</hi> a <hi>change,</hi> and introduc'd <hi>New</hi> Tenets, and propagated them over the Christian <hi>world,</hi> as is pretended, it must needs be manisestly and universally known that we <hi>did so;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it possible the change should be so insensible and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible,</hi>

that our very Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries cannot find it out; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially this alone making their <hi>Victory</hi> over us so certain and <hi>perfect.</hi> For seeing we own TRADITION as an <hi>In-fallible Rule,</hi> We are irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably overthrown, if they make out that <hi>we</hi> ever desert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed It: and, surely, nothing should be more easie than to make out That, than which, if True, nothing can possibly be more Notorious.</p>

which they <hi>hold them:</hi> if <hi>we</hi> ever, as 'tis said <hi>we have,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted Tradition, vve must, till the time we took it up again, have proceeded upon some <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Ground or <hi>Rule of Faith:</hi> And, because none ever char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged us with proceeding upon the <hi>Letter of Scripture</hi> or <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticism,</hi> and, besides <hi>these</hi> there is <hi>no other</hi> but <hi>Tradition,</hi> 'tis plain <hi>we never</hi> deserted, but <hi>always</hi> stuck to <hi>Tradition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="18">18. Besides, 'tis impossible that that Body of Men which claim for their Rule of Faith, an <hi>uninterrupted Tradition</hi> from the Apostles days, should not have held to that Rule of faith <hi>from the beginning:</hi> For, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise

they must have <hi>taken it up</hi> at some time or other, and by doing so, profess to the World, that <hi>Nothing</hi> is to be held of Faith, but what <hi>descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> by an uninterrupted deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very from the beginning; and yet at the same time acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that <hi>all</hi> they then held was <hi>not so descended,</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by <hi>another Rule,</hi> This of <hi>Tradition</hi> or uninterrupted Delivery being then <hi>newly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up;</hi> which is so palpable a Contradiction, that, as Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature could not fall into it: so, if it could, the very pretense would have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown it self, and needed no other confutation.</p>

               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:31244:19"/>
19. Add to this, that none of those many Sects who from time to time have deserted our Church's Faith and Disciplin, and so becom her Adversaries, ever yet pretended to assign the time <hi>when</hi> we took up this Rule of <hi>Tradition;</hi> and yet a change in that on which we profess to build <hi>all the rest,</hi> must needs be of all changes the most <hi>visible,</hi> and most apt to justifie the carriage of those Revolters. Wherefore, 'tis <hi>demonstrably evident</hi> on all sides, that, as this present Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of men, call'd the <hi>Roman-Catholick Church,</hi> does <hi>now hold</hi> to Tradition, so their Predecessors uninterruptedly
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:31244:20"/>
from the Apostles days <hi>did the same;</hi> that is, did hold to it <hi>ever.</hi> And, since 'tis shown before [§. 11.] that this Rule, <hi>if held to,</hi> will certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey down <hi>the true Faith</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chang'd <hi>to all</hi> after Ages, 'tis likewise demonstrable, that <hi>they</hi> have <hi>the true Faith,</hi> and are <hi>the truly Faithful,</hi> or <hi>true Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="20">20.
