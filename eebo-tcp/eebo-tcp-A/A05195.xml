            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in diuers points, to make it knowne to others, what good I haue found out in this facultie by long triall and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.

                  <p>I am not determined (neither can I worthily) to set forth the praises of this Art: how some, and not a few, euen of the best, haue accounted it a chiefe part of earthly happinesse, to haue faire and pleasant Orchards, as in <hi>Hesperia</hi> and <hi>Thessaly,</hi> how all with one consent agree, that it is a chiefe part of Husbandry (as <hi>Tully de senectute</hi>) and Husbandry maintaines the world; how ancient, how, profitable, how pleasant it is, how many secrets of nature it doth containe, how loued, how much practised in the best places, and of the best: This hath already beene done by many.

For there is no plague so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious as Popery and knauery, he will not purloine your profit, nor hinder your pleasures.</p>

than the which, there can be no humane thing more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, either for pleasure or profit, as shall (God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) be proued in the treatise following. And what an hinderance shall it be, not onely to the owner, but to the common good, that the vnspeakeble benefit of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred yeeres shall be lost, by the audacious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of an vnskilfull Arborist.</p>
                     <p>The Gardner had not need be an idle, or lazie Lub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, for so your Orchard being a matter of such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Painfull.</note> will not prosper. There will euer be some thing to doe. Weedes are alwaies growing. The great mother of all liuing Creatures, the Earth, is full of seed in her bowels, and any stirring glues them heat of Sunne, and being laid neere day, they grow: Mowles worke daily, though not alwaies alike. Winter herbes at all times will grow (except in extreame frost.) In Winter your young trees and herbes would be lightned of snow, and your Allyes cleansed: drifts of snow will set Deere, Hares, and Conyes, and other noysome beasts ouer your walles &amp; hedges, into your Orchard. When Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer cloathes your borders with greene and peckled co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, your Gardner must dresse his hedges, and antike workes: watch his Bees, and hiue them: distill his Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and other herbes. Now begins Summer Fruit to ripe, and craue your hand to pull them. If he haue a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den (as he must need) to keepe, you must needs allow him good helpe, to end his labours which are endlesse, for no one man is sufficient for these things.</p>

For who is able to manure an whole Orchard plot, if it be barren? But if you determine to manure the whole site, this is your way: digge a trench halfe a yard deepe, all along the lower (if there be a lower) side of your Orchard plot, casting vp all the earth on the inner side, and fill the same with good short, hot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if too much water be any hinderance to your walks (for dry walkes doe well become an Orchard, and an Orchard them:) raise your walkes with earth first, and

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LL your labour past and to come about an Orchard is lost vnlesse you fence well. It shall grieue you much to see your young sets rubd loose at the rootes, the barke pild, the boughes and twigs cropt, your fruite stolne, your trees broken, and your many yeares labours and hopes destroyed, for want of fences. A chiefe care must be had in this point. You must therefore plant in such a soile, where you may prouide a conuenient, strong and seemely fence. For you can possesse no goods, that haue so many enemies as an orchard, looke Chapter 13. Fruits are so delightsome, and desired of so many (nay, in a manner of all) and yet few will be at cost and take paines to prouide them. Fence well therefore, let your plot be wholly in your owne power, that you make all your fence your selfe: for neighbours fencing is none at all, or very carelesse. Take heed of a doore or window, (yea of a wall) of any other mans into your orchard:<note place="margin">Let the fence be your owne.</note> yea, though it be nayld vp, or the wall be high, for
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:26903:12"/>
perhaps they will proue theeues.</p>
                     <p>All Fences commonly are made of Earth,<note place="margin">Kinds of fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, earthen walles.</note> Stone, Bricke, Wood, or both earth and wood. Dry wall of earth, and dry Ditches, are the worst fences saue pales or railes, and doe waste the soonest, vnlesse they be well copt with glooe and morter, whereon at <hi>Mighill-tide</hi> it will be good to sow Wall-flowers, commonly called Bee-flowers, or winter Gilly-flowers, because they will grow (though amongst stones) and abide the strongest frost and drought, continually greene and flowring euen in Winter, and haue a pleasant smell, and are timely, (that is, they will floure the first and last of flowers) and are good for Bees. And your earthen wall is good for Bees dry and warme. But these fences are both vnseem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, euill to repaire, and onely for need, where stone or wood cannot be had. Whosoeuer makes such Walles, must not pill the ground in the Orchard, for getting earth, nor make any pits or hallowes, which are both vnseemly and vnprofitable. Old dry earth mixt with sand is best for these. This kind of wall will soone de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, by reason of the trees which grow neere it, for the roots and boales of great trees, will increase, vndermine, and ouerturne such walles, though they were of stone, as is apparant by Ashes, Rountrees, Burt-trees, and such like, carried in the chat, or berry, by birds into stone-walles.</p>
                     <p>Fences of dead-wood, as pales,<note place="margin">Pale and Raile.</note> will not last, neither will railes either last or make good fence</p>
                     <p>Stone walles (where stone may be had) are the best of this sort,<note place="margin">Stone walls.</note> both for fencing, lasting, and shrouding of your young trees. But about this must you bestow much paines and more cost, to haue them handsome, high and durable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:26903:13"/>But of all other (in mine owne opinion) Quickwood, and Moats or Ditches of water,<note place="margin">Quicke wood and Moates.</note> where the ground is le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, is the best fence. In vnequall grounds, which will not keepe water, there a double ditch may be cast, made streight and leuel on the top, two yards broad for a faire walke, fiue or sixe foot higher then the soyle, with a gutter on either side, two yards wide, and foure foot deepe set with out, with three or foure chesse of Thorns, and within with Cherry, Plumme, Damson, Bullys, Filbirds, (for I loue these trees better for their fruit, and as well for their forme, as priuit) for you may make them take any forme. And in euery corner (and middle if you will) a mount would be raised, whereabout the wood may claspe, powdered with wood-binde: which wil make with dressing a faire, plesant, profitable, &amp; sure fence. But you must be sure that your quicke thornes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grow wholly, or that there be a supply betime, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with planting new, or plashing the old where need is. And assure your selfe, that neither wood, stone, earth, nor water, can make so strong a fence, as this after seuen yeares growth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Moates.</note>Moates, Fish-ponds, and (especially at one side a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer) within and without your fence, will afford you fish, fence, and moysture to your trees, and pleasure also, if they be so great and deepe that you may haue Swans, &amp; other water birds, good for deuouring of vermine, and boat for many good vses.</p>
                     <p>It shall hardly auaile you to make any fence for your Orchard, if you be a niggard of your fruit. For as libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality will saue it best from noysome neighbours, libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality I say is the best fence, so Iustice must restraine ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oters. Thus when your ground is tempered, squared, and fenced, it is time to prouide for planting.</p>

But I suppose twenty yards distance is small enough betw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Canker is the consumption of any part of the tree, barke and wood,<note place="margin">Canker.</note> which also in the same place is decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phered vnder the title of water-boughes.</p>

And I find them short (at least) by so many parts in bignesse, although I know those other fruit-trees to haue beene much hindred in their stature by euill guiding. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence I gather thus.</p>

so trees must haue allowed them for their increase one third, another third for their stand, and a third part of time also for their decay.

A man comes not to his full growth and strength (by common estimation) before thirty yeeres, and some slender and cleane bodies, not till forty, so long also stands his strength, &amp; so long also must he haue allowed by course of nature to decay. Euer supposing that he be well kept with necessaries, and from and without straines, bruises, and all other dominyring diseases. I will not say vpon true report, that Physicke holds it possible, that a cleane body kept by these 3.

                     <p>NOw pause with your selfe, and view the end of all your labours in an Orchard: vnspeakable plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and infinite commodity. The pleasure of an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard I referre to the last Chapter for the conclusion: and in this Chapter, a word or two of the profit, which thorowly to declare is past my skill: and I count it as if a man should attempt to adde light to the Sunne with a Candle, or number the Starres. No man that hath but a meane Orchard or iudgement but knowes, that the commodity of an Orchard is great: Neither would I speake of this, being a thing so manifest to all; but that I see, that through the carelesse lazinesse of men, it is a thing generally neglected. But let them know, that they lose hereby the chiefest good which belongs to house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping.</p>
                     <p>Compare the commodity that commeth of halfe an acre of ground, set with fruit-trees and hearbs, so as is prescribed, and an whole acre (say it be two) with Corne, or the best commodity you can wish, and the Orchrad shall exceed by diuers degrees.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, the soyle of a Garden would be plaine and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:26903:44"/>
leuell, at least euery square (for we purpose the square to be the fittest forme) the reason:<note place="margin">Plaine.</note> the earth of a garden wanting such helpes, as should stay the water, which an orchard hath, and the rootes of hearbes being short, and not able to fetch their liquor from the bottome, are more annoyed by drought, and the soyle being mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and loose, is soone either washt away, or sends out his heart by too much drenching and washing.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, if a garden soyle be not cleere of weedes, and namely, of grasse, the hearbes shall neuer thriue: for how should good hearbes prosper, when euill weeds waxe so fast: considering good hearbes are tender in respect of euill weedes: these being strengthened by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the other by art? Gardens haue small place in comparison, and therefore may be more easily be fallowed, at the least one halfe yeare before, and the better dressed after it is framed. And you shall finde that cleane keeping doth not onely auoide danger of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering weedes, but also is a speciall ornament, and leaues more plentifull sap for your tender hearbes.</p>

                        <pb n="99" facs="tcp:26903:54"/>This is the forme, a Frame standing on posts with a Floore (if you would haue it hold more Hiues, two

                     <p>And though your Hiues stand within an hand breadth the one of another: yet will Bees know their home.</p>
                     <p>In this Frame may your Bees stand drye and warme, especially if you make doores like doores of windows to shroud them in winter, as in an house: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided you leaue the hiues mouths open. I my self haue

Bees loue no externall motions of dawbing or such like. Sometimes occasion shall be offered to lift and turne Hiues, as shall appeare hereafter. One light entire hiue of straw in that case is better, then one that is daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, weighty and cumbersome. I wish euery hiue, for a keeping swarme, to hold three pecks at least in measure. For too little Hiues procure Bees, in casting time, either to lye out, and loyter, or else to cast before they be ripe and strong, and so make weake swarmes and vntimely: Whereas if they haue roome sufficient, they ripen timely, and casting seasonably, are strong, and fit for labour presently. Neither would the hiue be too too great, for then they loyter, and waste meate and time.</p>
                     <p>Your Bees delight in wood, for feeding, especially for casting:<note place="margin">Hiuing of Bees.</note> therefore want not an Orchard. A <hi>Mayes</hi> swarme is worth a Maies Foale: if they want wood, they be in danger of flying away.

I much like M <hi>Markhams</hi> opinion for hiuing a swarme in combes of a dead or forsaken hiue, so they be fresh &amp; cleanly. To thinke that a swarme of your owne, or others, will of it selfe come into such an hiue, is a meere conceit <hi>Experto crede Roberto.</hi> His smearing with honey, is to no purpose, for the other Bees will eate it vp.

The Hiue being drest and ready spelkt, rubd and the hole made for their passage (I vse no hole in the Hiue, but a piece of wood hoal'd to saue the hiue &amp; keep out Mice) shake in your Bees, or the most of them (for all commonly you cannot get) the remainder will follow.

                     <p>Much descanting there is, of, and about the Master-Bee, and their degrees, order and gouernment: but the truth in this point is rather imagined, then demonstrated There are some coniectures of it, <hi>viz.</hi> we see in the combs diuers greater houses then the rest, &amp; we heare commonly the night before they cast, sometimes one Bee, sometimes two, or more Bees, giue a lowd and seueral found from the rest, and sometimes Bees of greater bodies then the common sort: but what of all this? I leane not on coniectures, but loue to set downe that I know to be true, and leaue these things to them that loue to diuine. Keepe none weake, for it is hazard, oftentimes with losse: Feeding will not helpe them: for being weake, hey cannot come downe to meate, or if they come downe, they dye, because Bees weake cannot abide cold. If none of these, yet will the other Bees being strong, smell the honey, and come and spoile, and kill them. Some helpe is in casting time, to put two weake swarmes together, or as M. <hi>Markham</hi> well saith: Let not them cast late, by raising them with wood or stone: but with impes (say I.) An impe is three or foure wreathes, wrought as the hiue, the same compasse, to rase the hiue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: but by experience in tryall,<note place="margin">Catching.</note> I haue found out a better way by Clustering, for late or weake swarmes hitherto not found out of any that I know.<note place="margin">Clustering.</note> That is this: After casting time, if I haue any stocke proud, and hindred from timely casting, with former Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

                        <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Rafting in the Barke, is vsed from mid-<hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust,</hi> to the beginning of Winter, and also when the Westerne winde beginneth to blow, being from the 7. of <hi>February,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to 11. of <hi>Iune.</hi> But there must care be had, not to graffe in the barke in any rainy season, because it would wash away the matter of ioyning the one and the other together, and so hinder it.</p>
                     <p>Grafting in the budde, is vsed in the Summer time, from the end of <hi>May,</hi> vntill <hi>August,</hi> as bring the time when the trees are strong and lusty, and full of sap and leaues. To wit, in a hot Countrey, from the midst of <hi>Iune,</hi> vnto the midst of <hi>Iuly</hi>: but cold Countries, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the midst of <hi>August,</hi> after some small showies of Raine.</p>
                     <p>If the Summer be so exceeding dry, as that some trees doe withhold their sap, you must waite the time till it doe returne.</p>
                     <p>Graft from the full of the Moone, vntill the end of the old.</p>
                     <p>You may graft in a Cleft, without hauing regard to the Raine, for the sap will keepe it off.</p>
                     <p>You may graft from mid-<hi>August,</hi> to the beginning of <hi>Nouember</hi>: Cowes dung with straw doth mightily preserue the graft.</p>
                     <p>It is better to graft in the euening, then the morning.</p>
                     <p>The furniture and tooles of a Grafter, are a Basket to lay his Grafts in, Clay, Grauell, Sand, or strong Earth, to draw ouer the plants clouen: Moste,

Woollen clothes, barkes of Wilow to ioyne to the late things and earth before spoken, and to keepe them fast: Oziers to tye againe vpon the barke, to keepe them firme and fast: gummed Wax, to dresse and couer the ends and tops of the grafts newly cut, that so the raine and cold may not hurt them, neither yet the sap rising from belowe, be constrained to returne againe vnto the shootes. A little Sawe or hand Sawe, to sawe off the stocke of the plants, a little Knife or Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knife to graffe, and to cut and sharpen the grafts, that so the barke may not pill nor be broken; which often commeth to passe when the graft is full of sap. You shall cut the graffe so long, as that it may fill the cliffe of the plant, and therewithall it must be left thicker on the barke side, that so it may fill vp both the cliffe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incisions, as any need is to be made, which must be alwaies well ground, well burnished without all r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He manner of grafting in a cleft, to wit, the stocke being clou'd, is proper not onely to trees, which are as great as a mans legs or armes, but also to greater. It is true that in as much as the trees can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not easily be clouen in their stocke, that therefore it is expedient to make incision in some one of their bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and not in the maine body, as we see to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in great Apple trees, and great Peare-trees, and as we haue already declared heretofore.</p>
                     <p>To graft in the cleft, you must make choise of a graft that is full of sap and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>yce, but it must not bee, but till from after <hi>Ianuary</hi> vntill <hi>March</hi>: And you must not thus graft in any tree that is already budded, because a great part of the iuyce and sap would be already moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp on high, and risen to the top, and there dispersed and scattered hither and thither, into euery sprigge and twigge, and vse nothing welcome to the graft.</p>
                     <p>You must likewise be resolued not to gather your graft the day you graft in, but ten or twelue dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: for otherwise, if you graft it new gathered, it will not be able easily to incorporate it selfe with the body and stocke, where it shall be grafted; because that some part of it will dry, and by this meanes will be a hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the stocke to the rising vp of the sap, which it should communerate vnto the graft, for the making of it to put forth. and whereas this dried part will fall a crumbling, and breaking thorow his rottennesse, it will cause to remaine a concauity, or hollow place in the stock, which will be an occasion of a like inconuenience
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:26903:62"/>
to befall the graft. Moreouer, the graft being new and tender, might easily be hurt of the bands, which are of necessity to be tyed about the Stocke, to keepe the graft firme and fast. And you must further see, that your Plant was not of late remoued, but that it haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready fully taken root.</p>
                     <p>When you are minded to graft many grafts into one cleft, you must see that they be cut in the end all alike.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> See that the grafts be of one length, or not much differing, and it is enough, that they haue three or foure eylets without the wrench when the Plant is once sawed, and lopped of all his small Siens and shootes round about, as also implyed of all his bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, if it haue many: then you must leaue but two at the most, before you come to the cleauing of it: then put to your little Saw, or your knife, or other edged toole that is very sharpe, cleaue it quite thorow the middest, in gentle and soft sort: First, tying the Stocke very sure, that so it may not cleaue further then is need: and then put to your Wedges into the cleft vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till such time as you haue set in your grafts, and in clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of it, hold the knife with the one hand, and the tree with the other, to helpe to keepe it from clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing too farre. Afterwards put in your wedge of Boxe or Brazill, or bone at the small end, that so you may the better take it out againe, when you haue set in your grafts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> If the Stocke be clouen, or the Barke loosed too much from the wood: then cleaue it downe lower, and set your grafts in, and looke that their incision bee fit, and very iustly answerable to the cleft, and that the two saps, first, of the Plant and graft, be right and euen set one against the other, and so handsomely fitted, as
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:26903:62"/>
that there may not be the least appearance of any cut or cleft. For if they doe not thus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>mpe one with another, they will neuer take one with another, because they cannot worke their seeming matter, and as it were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilaguous glue in conuenient sort or manner, to the glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their ioynts together. You must likewise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, not to make your cleft ouerthwart the pitch, but somewhat aside.</p>
                     <p>The barke of your Plant being thicker then that of your Graft, you must set the graft so much the more outwardly in the cleft, that so the two saps may in any case be ioyned, and set right the one with the other but the rinde of the Plant must be somewhat more out, then that of the grafts on the clouen side.</p>
                     <p>To the end that you may not faile of this worke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> of imping, you must principally take heed, not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-cleue the Stockes of your Trees. But before you widen the cleft of your wedges, binde, and goe about the Stocke with two or three turnes, and that with an Ozier, close drawne together, vnderneath the same place, where you would haue your cleft to end, that so your Stocke cleaue not too farre, which is a very vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all cause of the miscarrying of grafts, in asmuch as hereby the cleft standeth so wide and open, as that it cannot be shut, and so not grow together againe; but in the meane time spendeth it selfe, and breatheth out all his life in that place, which is the cause that the Stocke and the Graft are both spilt. And this falleth out most often in Plum-trees, &amp; branches of trees. You must be careful so to ioyne the rinds of your grafts, and Plants, that nothing may continue open, to the end that the wind, moisture of the clay or raine, running vpon the grafted place, do not get in: when the plant cleueth very
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:26903:63"/>
straight, there is not any danger nor hardnesse in slo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> downe the Graft. If you leaue it somewhat vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, or rough in some places, so that the saps both of the one and of the other may the better grow, and be giued together, when your grafts are once well ioyned to your Plants, draw out your wedges very softly, lest you displace them againe, you may leaue there within the cleft some small end of a wedge of greene wood, cutting it very close with the head of the Stocke: Some cast giue into the cleft, some Sugar, and some gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Waxe.</p>
                     <p>If the Stocke of the Plant whereupon you intend to graft, be not so thicke as your graft, you shall graft it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> after the fashion of a Goates foot, make a cleft in the Stocke of the Plant, not direct, but byas &amp; that smooth and euen, not rough: then apply and make fast thereto, the graft withall his Barke on, and answering to the barke of the Plant. This being done, couer the place with the fat earth and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In Summer when the trees are well replenished <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> with sap, and that their new Siens begin to grow somewhat hard, you shall take a shoote at the end of the chiefe branches of some noble and reclaimed tree, whereof you would faine haue some fruit, and not many of his old store or wood, and from thence ruise a good eylet, the tayle and all thereof to make your graft. But when you choose, take the thickest, and grossest, diuide the tayle in the middest, before you doe auy thing else, casting away the leafe (if it be not a Peare plum-tree: for that would haue two or three leaues) without remouing any more of the said tayle: afterward with the point of a sharpe knife, cut off the Barke of the said shoote, the patterne of a shield, of the length of a nayle.</p>

You shall finde out if the Scutcheon be nothing worth, if looking within when it is pulled away from the wood of the same sute, you finde it to haue a hole within, but more manifestly, if the bud doe stay behind in the Wood, which ought to haue beene in the Scutcheon.</p>

You must note, that the Scutcheon which is gathered from the Sien of a tree whose fruite is sowre, must be cut in square forme, and not in the plaine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion of a Scutcheon. It is ordinary to graffe the sweet Quince tree, bastard Peach-tree, Apricock-tree, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iube-tree, sowre Cherry treee, sweet Cherry-tree, and Chestnut tree, after this fashion, howbeit they might be grafted in the cleft more easily, and more profitably; although diuers be of contrary opinion, as thus best: Take the grafts of sweet Quince tree, and bastard Peach-tree, of the fairest wood, and best fed that you can finde, growing vpon the wood of two <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> yeeres old, because the wood is not so firme nor solid as the others: and you shall graffe them vpon small Plum-tree stocks, being of the thicknes of ones thumbe; these you shall cut after the fashion of a Goats foot: you
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:26903:65"/>
shall not goe about to make the cleft of any more sides then one, being about a foot high from the ground; you must open it with your small wedge: and being thus grafted, it will seeme to you that it is open but of one side; afterward you shall wrap it vp with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Mosse, putting thereto some gummed Wax, or clay, and binde it vp with Oziers to keepe it surer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the stocke is not strong enough it selfe to hold it, and you shall furnish it euery manner of way as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are dealt withall: this is most profitable.</p>
