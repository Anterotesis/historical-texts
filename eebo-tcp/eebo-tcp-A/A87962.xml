         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

LETTER
FROM
SCOTLAND.
GIVING A
True Relation of the unhappy Loſs
OF THE
Glouceſter-Frigot,
Whereof Sir <hi>John Berry</hi> was Commander.
With a particular Account of the Perſons of Quality
drowned therein, and the miraculous Eſcape of His
Royal Higneſs the Duke of <hi>York.</hi>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Shall give you an Account from hence, as I received it
from a faithful Hand, of the loſs of the <hi>Glouceſter</hi> Frigot,
which was thus:</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Berry</hi> Commander of the <hi>Glouceſter</hi> Frigot, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
received on Board the ſaid Ship His Royal Highneſs in <hi>Margaret</hi>
Road, in order to his Voyage for <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſet Sail from thence
with a fair Wind, the Weather continuing very Fair, attended by
the <hi>Ruby, Happy Return,</hi> the <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> and <hi>Pearl</hi> Frigots, with
ſeveral Yatches, and ſeveral Perſons of great Quality, both of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Scotland,</hi> attending His Royal Highneſs on the Seventh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant:
At Night they came about 16 Leagues off the Mouth of the
<hi>Humber,</hi> about which place lies a Sand called the <hi>Lemon-Oar,</hi> and
whether by the unskilfulneſs, or wretched neglect of the Pilot,
God knows the aforeſaid Ship in which His Royal Highneſs was,
and many other Perſons of Quality, run on Ground upon the ſaid
Sands, about Ten of the Clock at Night; but it pleaſing God that
the Weather proving Fair and not Stormy, that the Ship did
not preſently Burſt, nor did not immediately Sink, but lay ſome
hours e're She Sank; ſo that the Duke, and ſome others, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as the Long Boat could hold, had time to eſcape the Danger
<pb facs="tcp:151227:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and ventur'd to Sea, and got ſafe aboard on one of the Yatches,
but for the reſt remaining on board, the Ship foundring before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Boats could come to their Aſſiſtance, all periſhed, among
whom was the Lord <hi>Roxborow,</hi> the Lord <hi>O Bryan,</hi> the Lord <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
Lord <hi>Hume,</hi> Lord <hi>Dowglaſs,</hi> Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Muſgrave,</hi> Sir
<hi>James Hyde,</hi> Mr. <hi>Clifton,</hi> and an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lady, whoſe name we
cannot as yet learn; all the Dukes Cooks but one, all his Footmen,
and all the reſt of his Servants, Sir <hi>Charles Scarborow</hi> was miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
ſaved (as we ſuppoſe) on ſome piece of the Ship. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
Sir <hi>John Berry,</hi> was alſo loſt with his Brother, Captain <hi>Berry,</hi>
and ſeveral others who accompanied him: There was in all to the
number of three hundred and three Perſons, and odd, of which but
ſixty were ſaved. The Duke is ſince ſafely here to the Joy of his
Dutcheſs, and others who have been to Congratulate his Eſcape
from ſo great Danger: His Royal Highneſs is very ſenſible, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
troubled at the loſs of ſo many Noble Perſons, and others,
and of ſo gallant a Ship. The Pilot is ſecured in <hi>Edinborow.</hi> This
is all at preſent, our late Inſurrection being fully quieted. I am <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
