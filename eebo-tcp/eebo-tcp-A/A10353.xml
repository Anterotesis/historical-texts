            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go their ſupper is no Sacrament of Chriſt. To M. B. his ſuppoſed reply, that the vvords of Chriſt are not omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for that before the ſermon, the miniſter hiſtorically out of the pulpit mentioneth Chriſts inſtitution; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvere is already made, that this nothing helpeth them, but much more ſhevveth their infinite pride, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous breach of Chriſts order. For Chriſt firſt of al tooke the bread in to his hands, bleſſed it, brake it, &amp; after pronounced thoſe vvords; they cleane contrary, firſt of al reherſe thoſe vvords out of the pulpit, vvhere there is no bread high them, much leſſe haue they the bread in their hands as Chriſt had. I anſvvere furthermore that ſuch hiſtorical narration (being told an hovvre or 2. before the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, and the entier Sermon coming betvvene) can haue no relation to the bleſſing or ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying of their Supper. For as M. B. here telleth vs, <hi>there is an eſſential forme in baptiſme: there is an eſſential</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>forme in the ſupper: which if they be tane away, ye tyne the ſacrament. The eſſential forme of baptiſme is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I baptiſe thee in the name of the father, of the ſonne, and of the holy ghoſt.</hi> And according to the order of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion<note place="margin">The Scottiſh communion booke.</note> booke, the miniſter <hi>as he ſpeaketh theſe words, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth water in his hand, &amp; layeth it vpon the childs forehead.</hi> VVhereby vve ſee that the eſſential forme is to haue the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:16016:128"/>
words ioyned with the element: &amp; if the miniſter ſpeake the words at one hovvre, &amp; lay on vvater the next vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the vvords, he tyneth and deſtroyeth the eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al forme of baptiſme, and ſo it is no ſacrament. Ergo by like reaſon vvhereas the ſacrament of Chriſts body hath a like <hi>eſſential forme</hi> as baptiſme hath; the Miniſter making a narration of Chriſts vvords before the ſermon as it vvere at 9. of the clocke, and after an hovvre, at ten delivering bread and vvine vvithout the vvords of Chriſt, tyneth and deſtroyeth the ſacrament of the ſupper, and ſo the Scottiſh ſupper is no ſacrament of Chriſt.</p>

And the philoſophers vvho knew nothing of faith, nor the reſurrection of humane bodies to life eternal; and by humane reaſon and vvit aſſigned to humane bodies according to the drift of humane reaſon, of the courſe of nature and this vvorld, thoſe 3. properties vvhich M.

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:16016:193"/>
blud of the new teſtament. And the blud of an ox, of a goate, of a calf in the old law, may ſerve M. B. for his figurative &amp; tropical ſpeech. For ſo that vvas tropically in deed the new teſtament, vvhich it ſignified and figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But the blud of Chriſt is more truly and properly, &amp; after a more divine ſort called the new teſtament, ether for that it is the ſpecial and principal legacie and gift beſtowed on vs by Chriſt in his new teſtament: or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the very founteyne of grace, vvhich is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe geuen properly in the new Teſtament, and vvhereby vve have right to glorie and life eternal, which is the conſequent of grace and effect thereof in the new teſtament. For this and ſuch like cauſe, is Chriſts blud (as in the chalice) called the new teſtament: the confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vvhich teſtament conſiſted in the death of Chriſt, &amp; effuſion of the ſame blud on the croſſe. As for figuring, and ſignifying, that is no cauſe of this appellation. And therefore to ſay, <hi>This is the new teſtament,</hi> that is, <hi>This ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth</hi> or figureth the new teſtament, is to make the blud of Chriſt no better then the blud of a beaſt: vvhich is a propoſition fitter for a beaſt or a miniſter (vvho in ſo ſpeaking litle diſſereth from a beaſt) then for a Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man. If againſt this M. B. vvil ſtil cavil to find out here a figure; let him take this for a final anſwere, that this ſpeech of S. Luke moſt effectual and ſignificant, though not ſo proper or common, is properly expreſſed by S. Matthew and S. Marke, <hi>This is my blud of the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> vvhich is a ſufficient commentarie to expound S.<note place="margin">Matth. 26.

The laſt example of S. Paule calling <hi>Chriſt a rocke,</hi> is a figure like<note place="margin">n</note> to this former. A figure there is one vvay, but not as M. B. meaneth. That the vvorde <hi>rocke</hi> is applied to Chriſt, is<note place="margin">Hovv the rock vvas Chriſt.</note> a metaphore and figure: as vvhen he is called a lyon, a lamb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a doore, a vine, &amp;c.

<pb n="373" facs="tcp:16016:193"/>
his tropical and ſignificative <hi>ſpeech</hi> more then in the reſt, ſurely herein he is very ſpecially deceiued. For vvhen S.
