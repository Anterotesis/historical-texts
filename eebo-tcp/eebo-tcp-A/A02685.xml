            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Is Saul alſo among the Prophets?</hi> His friends held it ſtrange to ſee him prophecying, or ſinging holy ſongs (as it is expounded:) and it will be as ſtrange to all that know me, <note place="margin">Vide Vatabl. ad locum.</note> to finde me in the Preſſe, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of mine inſufficiencie, (in which regard the word is put vpon me by him that applies it to ſuch ſmatterers) as alſo in regard of my diſpoſition and affection, <note place="margin">Polyd.

               </note> who haue in others diſliked this ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing, and for my ſelfe alwaies affected (it may be too much) priuacie and retiredneſſe. But ſee what importunitie can doe. In the ſecond of the Kings, chap. <hi>2.</hi> there is a very abſurd motion made to <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha</hi> by well meaning men, and <hi>Eliſha</hi> in the end yeelds to them in a ſort againſt his will. And why? they were inſtant vpon him till hee was aſhamed, verſ. <hi>17.</hi> This motion of printing was to me at firſt as that to him; yet now at laſt, (being aſhamed to
<pb facs="tcp:17107:3"/>be inexorable) I haue ſaid with him, Send. Now if the Printer (the chiefe actor I meane in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) returne as wiſe as they, hauing his labour (with them) for his paines, my anſwer is the ſame with the Prophets, Said I not, Doe not goe? Thou haſt my defenſe (Reader) for the printing. If any thing offend thee in the Sermon preached, thou muſt remember, that I meant it to an aſſembly knowne, not to ſtrangers vnknowne: and therefore doe not blame me for not vſing the Latine or Greeke tongue, vnleſſe thou canſt helpe my hearers to Latine or Greeke eares, and then I ſhall make no more ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Latine then Engliſh: In the meane time I dare promiſe no more then that I thinke is as familiar to them as Engliſh, yea ſuch Engliſh as they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; for ſome Engliſh is Hebrew to the vulgar ſort. If thou take exception further at my naked margent, becauſe it is ſo empty of humane Authors, I pray thee be ſatisfied with this anſwer: Firſt, our Auditors in theſe parts are content to take Gods bare word, without any further band or teſtimonie: Secondly, I cannot diſcharge my ſelfe (I iudge not others that vſe it) of pride and ambition, if I ſhould be quoting: for all that know the ſmalneſſe of my ſtanding, weakneſſe of my body, greatneſſe of imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in a place vndertaken with as much feare
<pb facs="tcp:17107:3"/>and vnwillingneſſe, as it is vndergone with paine and heauineſſe, doe well know that my reading can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be great; and my owne ſoule knowes, that there can be nothing to worke me to this practiſe (in theſe parts) vnleſſe I would be ambitious: for to what end ſhould I tell poore people of Fathers and Hiſtorians? What ſhould mooue mee to it, when I know before hand, they will thinke neuer the better of me, nor of my doctrine, for ſo doing? (verb. gra.) In ſpeaking of Iobs children, in the firſt point I allude to a place in Chryſoſtome: to what end ſhould I amaze them with his name and his homilie, Ad pop. Antioch.? In a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place, ſpeaking of ſinne in the godly, ad ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, I remembred Auſtins diſcourſe about that matter. In ſpeaking of Popes, I thought of Polydore <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgils note in that behalfe: and the bringing in of Dauid ſpeaking to his ſonne, put mee in minde of Caeſars patheticall ſpeech to Brutus, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>and the very mention of Abſaloms rockie heart, not yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, brought to my remembrance Hannibals pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe with the rockes, to make them giue place. Now (I pray you) had not I little to doe, if I ſhould thrust all theſe into a Sermon? If I ſhould doe ſo in ſuch an Auditory, would not my heart ſay, Now thou ſeekeſt thyſelfe? What others doe, I know not; I iudge none; my heart would ſmite me for it in this place:
<pb facs="tcp:17107:4"/>and therefore bold me excuſed (good Reader) till I ſee further reaſon for ſuch a practiſe. In the meane time, if this Sermon be too plaine for thee, leaue it to them that loue plainneſſe. If thou finde any benefit by it, bleſſe God, thanke the Printer, beſtow one praier on mee, who deſire increaſe of grace on thee, and on all the Iſrael of God.</p>

Yet if you will, (to the end you may the better ſee the grounds of the points to be gathered) you may obſerue in them two things: Firſt, <hi>Dauids</hi> ſorrow: Secondly, the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion thereof. The occaſion is implied in the firſt word, which is capable of more readings then it hath letters in it by farre: and heere we render it [<hi>Then.</hi>] His ſorrow is ſet downe, both as it was inwardly conceiued, and outwardly expreſſed; conceiued, he was mooued; expreſſed, partly by deeds; hee wept, which is amplified from the place, on the ſtaires, and in the chamber: partly in words, words (I ſay) of complaint and wiſh, and all for his ſonne <hi>Abſalom.</hi> Let vs beginne with the firſt: and ſith time will not giue mee leaue to ſpeake of all, let vs gripe as much at once as wee can, and binde many things together within the compaſſe of few points. <hi>Then</hi> (ſaith the text). i. when he had receiued newes touching <hi>Abſaloms</hi> death, <hi>the King,</hi> i. <hi>Dauid, Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loms</hi> father, <hi>Iſraels</hi> King, <hi>was mooned:</hi> the word importeth ſome great alteration in a man by reaſon either of ſome feare, or griefe, or anger, or all. Now howſoeuer all theſe did meet in <hi>Dauid,</hi> yet in this place his motion is chiefely from griefe: feare had the precedencie before, whileſt he was held in ſuſpence, and the iſſue of the battle was doubtfull: anger tooke its place after, when he<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> had more leaſure to thinke on <hi>Ioab:</hi> now griefe was predominant, which at the firſt did amaze him, and after vttered it ſelfe in teares and complaints. When a man hath ſome deepe gaſh, or ſudden chop, you ſhall haue for the preſent a great

It may bee you would thinke it a loſſe to part with ſo much goods and cattell ſo ſoone, to be worth a thouſand pound in the morning, and to haue all your grounds vnſtockt by night: it may be it would trouble our patience to heare the ſcornes of baſe fellowes, and to ſee that contempt in our owne ſeruants: but (alas) if our kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt friends ſhould quippe vs, and they that were religious cenſure vs, if our owne wiues ſhould begin to be wearie of vs, and wee ſhould haue the burying of ten children, and firſt vnburie them, and there ſee how louingly they ſate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and what prouiſion was there made for the chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their hearts, and heere plucke out one, there ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (perhaps) lim-meale and lay them all on an heape: would not this haue wrought vpon vs? But then, if to all this there ſhould be added ſuch plagues on the body, ſuch terrors on the ſoule, would wee not ſay, our croſſes were ſharpe? yes (brethren:) we may ſay that <hi>Iobs</hi> were ſharpe, and ſore and neere, when friends, when ſeruants, when children, when wife, when God and all ſeeme to miniſter matter of griefe. It ſhall be needleſſe to draw you further in examples, theſe are beyond exception, whether you looke to the goodnes of the men, or the greatnes of their croſſes, in all whom we ſee that verified, which once <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> the ſonne, and <hi>Dauid</hi> the father deliuered in more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall tearmes, the one touching the number of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls afflictions, <note place="margin">Pro. 24.16.

But leauing teſtimonies, what might bee the cauſe that Gods beſt chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are ſo ſped? Is it their religion? Is it their profeſſion? No, <note place="margin">Reaſon. 1.</note> no, it is becauſe they are ſet with corruption (if you will haue it all at once) and therefore muſt be purged: For firſt (a little to enlarge our ſelues in the vnfolding of ſome few amongſt many reaſons) Gods beſt children will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times venture on noiſome meates and hurtfull poiſons,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17107:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>they will feede on the groſſer ſinnes, they will drinke in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry puddle, I meane iniquities, and when the child hath ſo done, what ſhould the father doe? If <hi>Dauid</hi> will lie and commit adultery, and fall to murther innocents, what can God doe leſſe for <hi>Dauid,</hi> vnleſſe he would haue him dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then ſcourge him thorowly? what ſhould hee doe but lay it on his skinne, yea and laſh his conſcience, and when he will bee walking ſo neere hels mouth, take him by the heeles and make him beleeue he will throw him in? what though he do cry? what though he be croſſed of his will? Is it not better hee ſhould cry here then in hell? and receiue his payment here rather then his iudgement there? Is it not better he ſhould loſe his ſin, then God his child? So then, one cauſe why the Lord doth thus lay load on his children here, is, becauſe they defile themſelues (ſometimes) with groſſe ſinnes, and therefore muſt haue much waſhing; they take the deadlieſt poiſon, and therfore muſt haue working phyſicke. <hi>Dauid</hi> was gone ſo farre this way, that to this place hee hath not recouered himſelfe, hee deales not like old <hi>Dauid</hi> as yet, and therefore euery moneth almoſt hee muſt haue a purge; and whoſoeuer he be that will venture after him in theſe dangerous paths, ſhall be ſure to paſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the rod, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did, if he be Gods as <hi>Dauids</hi> was. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Gods children if they fall not to deadly poiſon, yet will they ſurfet of lawfull meates and pleaſures vnlawfully, ſo childiſh we are when we are turned looſe to delights, that for our liues, wee cannot keepe a meane; wee cannot haue proſperity but wee will abuſe it, wee ſwell, wee bragge, wee ſnuffe, we looke ouer our brethren and forget our ſelues, euen the beſt of vs all.

Thus <hi>Hezechiah</hi> thought he ſpake but reaſon: but the Lord ſeeing him ſo ranke, thinkes it time to let him blood, and therefore <hi>Eſay</hi> giues him a cooler, you haue made (ſaith he) for ſo in effect hee ſpeakes) a faire hand of your wealth you haue; you haue brought the wolfe to the fold, and now keepe him out if you can: Gold-thirſty Babell now knowes where to haue a draught: and as for your ſelfe, ſith you thinke the better of your ſelfe for your wealth, the Lord hath made your will, and the king of Babell is your executor. Thus becauſe <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiah</hi> ſurfeited, he is phyſickt: and this is onother reaſon of the Lords thus dealing with his people, becauſe the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is not great whether you eate bad meate, or ſurfet on good. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, God had but neede to diet the beſt of vs ſometimes, becauſe we be ſo lazie when we are full, much like to a man that comes newly from a feaſt, fit for nothing; we follow our calling as if we would drop on ſleepe, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme exerciſes of religion, as children ſay their leſſons, minding euery thing rather than that in hand: wee come to the ordinances of God, as fed wantons to a feaſt, nothing pleaſeth vnleſſe it be ſome odde ſawce or new inuention, the worſt diſh on the table; ſo it is with vs, when wee come to the word, the ſenſe muſt be pleaſed as well as the heart e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified, elſe it is but a dry feaſt, one tricke of wit doth more affect, than twenty gratious ſentences: now when the Lord ſees our mouth ſo farre out of taſte, that it cannot
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17107:7"/>reliſh our meate, and diſcouers in vs ſuch a lazineſſe about our buſines, he thinkes it reaſon to prouide ſome remedie in time, leſt theſe fore-runners of ſicknes breake forth into worſe inconueniences; and ſurely <hi>Dauids</hi> practiſe and caſe may affright vs all; for (alas) how did he gather mud, when he had ſtood ſtill a while? and how would his corruptions againe haue growne to ſome head, had not <hi>Abſalom</hi> beene raiſed vp to breath him, and to diſperſe them? Now if <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> were ſo foggie after ſo many breathings, <hi>Dauid</hi> a man of ſo good a diet, how reſty ſhould wee bee if neuer walkt? how grounded on our lees with <hi>Moab,</hi> if neuer turned forth from veſſell to veſſell? It ſtands the Lord therefore vpon, if hee will prouide for his harueſt, and our good, to take ſome paines with vs, leſt otherwiſe he faile of his vintage, whilſt we want dreſſing.</p>

Now if good <hi>Dauid</hi> after ſo much breaking and ſo long ſtanding in religion, be ſo waſpiſh, ſo impatient, ſo paſſionate, do not you thinke that there is ſome ſtore in vs? let vs be croſſed a little, cannot we chafe? let vs be abuſed, cannot we find our tongues? adde to this our worldlines, cannot wee bee content to liuelonger in this world (bad though it be?) do we not dote too much on one <hi>Abſalom</hi> or other? be not our hearts yet vnbroken? why then you ſee, God muſt ſmite and ſmite againe, and ſmite home, &amp; draw blood: for no ſound heart muſt go to heauen, as none
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17107:8"/>but ſound hearts muſt come thither, ſound (I ſay) from hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, but broken with ſinne and ſorrow: thus wee ſee great cauſe of great affliction on Gods part, ſith our ſinnes are great which muſt be purged and preuented, our ſurfers great which muſt be cured, our deadneſſe great, which muſt be quickned, our inſide bad, which muſt be cleanſed. Time will not giue to ſpeake of all: One more reaſon ſhall bee drawne from our owne practiſe, and ſo an end.

The wicked will happily thinke themſelues wronged, that we giue not them and their maſter the credit of the Saints troubles, but (to ſpeake properly) they are no cauſes, but onely executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, they are hangmen and bedles; when an execution is to be wrought, and the Lord hath aſsigned ſome of his ſhrewdeſt children to puniſhment, they ſhall haue the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice ſometimes to bee the gaoler or belman, that is their preferment. Leauing therfore theſe ſcullians in the kitchin there to ſcoure a veſſell or licke a diſh when they ſhall bee called vpon, let vs make our vſe of this ſo large a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and ſee whether wee can bee briefer there.

            <p>Is this ſo, <note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> that Gods deareſt children haue and muſt haue ſuch great and piercing croſſes in this life? then muſt all who would be knowne by that name, make account of ſuch and prepare for them. Such is our follie (for the moſt part) when the ſunne ſhines, we neuer thinke of a darke night, &amp; when the morning is faire, wee neuer feare a ſtorme, and therefore are ſometimes taken without our cloake (as it were.) Such alſo is our conceit of our ſelues, and confidence in worldly helps, that we hope they will not ſee vs want; or if they faile, yet we thinke to ſhift better then others can, &amp; to liue by our wits: hence it is, that we are almoſt growen to Babels concluſion. Though others be widowes, fatherles, childleſſe, comfortles: yet wee ſhall ſee no ſorrow. But it will be granted (I trow) that our nature needs phyſicke, as much as other mens (there is no difference in the mould) &amp; that our carriage hath not beene ſo good, but that iuſtly we may feare ſome bruſhing. It may be, <hi>Dauid</hi> was as honeſt a man as ſome of vs, <note place="margin">Mat. 7.14.</note> perhaps <hi>Hezechiah</hi> was not farre behind vs, poſſible <hi>Paul</hi> might match vs in any grace, and haue as little pride, hypocriſie, ſelf-loue, paſſion in him as the beſt of vs all; yet were theſe (holy men) greatly afflicted and wonderouſly ſtraitned, &amp; why ſhould we dreame of peace: If wealth would diſcharge a man of croſſes, <hi>Hezechiah</hi> was not poore: if honour, <hi>Dauid</hi> was a king: if either witte or grace, <hi>Paul</hi> was no babe: but theſe will not ſerue the turne, kings children muſt haue phyſicke (if ſicke) as well as poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer mens; why ſhould they not? ſo muſt the Lords. Our Prince is conſecrated through afflictions, our way is an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted way (as you would ſay) and it is the voice of heauen, that thorow manie tribulations we muſt enter into heauen. Now then, ſith the caſe ſo ſtands, that either wee muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime the right of children, or elſe indure afflictions, either paſſe vnder the rod or be baſtards, let vs (vnleſſe we meane to ſhame our ſelues) arme our ſelues for croſſes before hand, and not prepare onely, but prepare for all, yea the neareſt of all. For what hath befallen <hi>Dauid</hi> and others, why may not the ſame befall vs? ſome wiues haue great croſſes in their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, ſome husbands in their wiues, ſome parents in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,

O then let vs thinke on theſe things in this our peace, and now lay in for a rainy day, now whilſt wee can pray, now whilſt our bodies are free from diſtemper, and our affections from trouble, now whilſt wee are our owne men, and haue freedome (as it were) of heart; now let vs hoard vp praiers againſt the time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when as either in reſpect of ſicknes in body, or ſorrow of minde, we can ſay no more then <hi>Dauid</hi> now can (my ſon, my ſon, my paine, my paine, my heart, my heart.) Now let vs treaſure vp faith and patience, and wiſedome, as <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> did corne, ſith a day of vtterance will come, a day of ſpending, not of getting, a day wherein our owne ſtocke &amp; the Churches treaſury too (I meane others praiers) will bee little enough: do notthinke it ſufficient to haue ſomewhat before hand, wee are not at agreement with croſſes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part when we giue warning; neuer forget <hi>Dauid,</hi> a man not meanely graced, nay a great husband, who had his ſoule well ſtockt, and in good plight, and yet how vnhandſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth hee now behaue himſelfe? Ah <hi>Dauid,</hi> thou waſt wont to haue praiers, and gracious meditations, as ready as <hi>Aburs</hi> ſword that would drop out of the ſheath: But now here is nothing but my ſon, my ſon; and little doe we know how we ſhall fling out in diſtreſſes, vnleſſe we are very wel appointed. Now laſtly whilſt the Lord doth offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto vs as a louing father, let vs come vnto him like obedient children, let vs confeſſe againſt our ſelues, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile our ſoules vnto him: Let vs ſeeke to him (as once the <hi>Sidomians</hi> did to <hi>Herod</hi>) through Chriſt (as they through <hi>Blaſtus</hi>) for his fauour (as they for <hi>Herods</hi> loue,) <note place="margin">Act. 12.</note> and then being at peace with him in our peace, and acquainted with him in our proſperity, he will know our ſoules in aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and we ſhall alwaies haue a rocke to ſly vnto in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt waues and ſurges.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Is this ſo, that the deareſt of Gods children haue great and neere afflictions in this life? then this muſt teach the wicked to leaue iudging abroad, and to looke homeward: they are on horſebacke, they, when Gods children are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfoote, it is their ioy to ſee the faithfull grieue, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hold but role it out; Theſe (ſay they) be the fellowes, theſe preachers ſo much magnifie, theſe the happy ones, theſe goe away with all the comforts, they cannot doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, they; but by your leaue, ſuch a iudgement hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen one, ſuch a plague another, and which of them eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capes better? and this they get by running to ſermons, &amp; thus they triumph. But ſtay a while, and pauſe better on the matter: are Gods children thus wounded? what ſhall become of his enemies? are the righteous thus paid, how much more the ſinner? Is this done to the greene tree? Doth the Lord thus viſit thoſe vpon whom his name is called? doth iudgement thus begin at Gods houſe? where ſhall the wicked appeare are infirmities accompanied with croſſes? what will be the end of idolatry, of blaſphemy, of murther, of adultery, of oppreſſion? are the waies to ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons thus ſtrawed with croſſes, what ſhall be found in the waies of whoredome, of blood, of drunkenneſſe? &amp;c.

Go on then with thy tale, Gods children are afflicted, and greatly affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted too; I will grant you all; but wote you what? if Gods children (whom hee loues next vnto himſelfe in Chriſt) cannot be exempted from croſſes, (bitter croſſes) notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their repentance, all their teares, all their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but their ſoules ſhall grone, and hearts ake, becauſe they be ſo ſtubborne and performe holie dueties no more, no better; I report me to thee, whether thou doſt not think that Gods iuſtice will one day haue thy blood, thy life, thy ſoule, for all thine abominations which thou doſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent for, but laugheſt at, which thou doſt not pray againſt, that they may be pardoned, but fretreſt that they ſhould be diſgraced, and which thou art ſo farre from leauing, that thou couldeſt drinke his blood that reprooues them in thee. And if ſo, then either make vſe of the faithfuls trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and quickly iudge thy ſelfe, or elſe, take euery diſgrace, euery diſeaſe, euery affliction that befalles them, to bee a pledge of that euerlaſting ſhame, and thoſe euerlaſting tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, woes, plagues, curſes, that ſhall ſeize vpon thee for euermore.

Hauing thus diſpatcht the firſt thing growing out of theſe circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances named, we muſt come to a ſecond, which is almoſt as generall (for when ſhould we haue done, if we ſhould deſcend to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars?) this that we may make way vnto, let vs a little view <hi>Dauids</hi> behauiour in this his diſtreſſe. There is none of vs can denie, but his occaſion of griefe was great, great reaſon hee had to mourne, who ſaith to the contrary? It was no ſmall croſie to ſee ones child die in ſuch a quarrell: but yet there is a meane in all things (as the prouerbe runneth) his behauiour is very ſtrange, his mourning not like <hi>Dauids:</hi> for whereas this riuer and flood of teares may ſeeme to bee fed from a three-fold ſpring, fleſh, nature and grace, and ſo his ſorrow to be partly ſpirituall, for <hi>Abſaloms</hi> ſoule, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly naturall, in that he was his ſonne, partly carnall, in that he was his <hi>Abſalom:</hi> yet the truth is, his ſorrow is rather carnall then otherwiſe, if the parts be conſidered: for firſt, nature goes not ſo farre as to wiſh the deſtruction of it ſelf, as <hi>Dauid</hi> here doth; O that I were dead, dead for thee, or in thy ſtead: and as for grace, it would neuer bring forth ſuch fruits of paſſion, as to wiſh death in diſcontentment, nor prouoke to whining in this vndecent maner, but would haue compoſed the affections rather, and haue taught him to mourne in ſilence; Beſides, his ſorrow is too much to be good, and comes with too much eaſe from him, and is too ſoone ripe to be ſpirituall fruit. Howſoeuer then we deny not, but <hi>Dauid</hi> was a ſanctified man, and ſo had ſanctified affections, and withall was full of naturall affection, yet in this particular, and at this inſtant; he was more vnnaturall to himſelfe, then naturall to his ſonne, and bewrayed more fleſh for the preſent by farre, then ſpirit, yea, that ſo drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this, that the motions thereof, could not as yet bee heard. Now this light beeing thus giuen to the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, you ſee the points do offer themſelues ſo faſt vnto vs, and come ſo thicke vpon vs, that wee know not well which to receiue, and what to put backe. This (if you ſay the word) ſhall lead the way: In that this man (no worſe a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17107:12"/>man than <hi>Dauid</hi>) thus exceeds in ſorrow vpon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in ſo carnall a manner: <note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note> Let vs learne, that Gods beſt children are apt to grieue too much, and to exceede in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for outward things; as in mirth, when once we are in, we are apt to forget our ſelues; ſo in ſorrow, when once wee yeelde vnto it, wee are in danger of ſurfetting vpon it. A man would thinke that <hi>Dauid</hi> ſhould bee as little troubled with this diſeaſe as any man liuing; for whether you looke to nature or grace, the bankes ſeeme to be ſo ſound, that no exceſſe of ſorrow can ouerflow them: for firſt, if you looke to complexion, he ſeemes to bee made of the lighteſt tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, a man whoſe ruddy face ſeemes to promiſe a reſolute and cheerefull heart: if you looke to naturall helpes, his skill in muſicke (to ſay nothing of any elſe) was not ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and as for ſpirituall meanes, the beſt medicines to cure diſcaſes, the king was behind none in theſe matters: his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were very eminent, his experience much; and yet if <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> will but plod awhile on croſſes, nay, if hee will not bee prepared for them, it is ſtrange to ſee how vnlike himſelfe he is, he cries as if he had beene ſtickt. In the next chapter he takes vp the ſame note againe: nay, he will die forſooth, he will be gone, he will to his ſonne: and why? he is his <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalom.</hi> And what thinke you of <hi>Iob?</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iob 3.</note> the Lord himſelfe giues him a good report, out of doubt hee was an honeſt man; but did you euer heare a wiſe man ſo farre forget himſelfe? he is angry with the light, quarels with the night, hath a ſaying to the ſtarres, to his mother, to the midwife, there is no dealing with him in his fit, and yet the occaſion out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Inſtances of this kinde there bee more then enow, but they are vnpleaſant, and therefore I will content my ſelfe with one more, and that is <hi>Ionah,</hi> as ſtrange a man of an honeſt man as you haue lightly heard of. This <hi>Ionah</hi> was croſſed (as he thought) firſt in his credit: <note place="margin">Ionah 4.1.</note> how bare he that? vntowardly enough, the matter ſeemed naught, ſtarke naught to him (ſaith the text) he chaſed exceedingly: and what was the matter? the Lord preferred many mens ſouls before the ſatisfying of his luſt: a great matter: yet this man would not brooke it at Gods hand, till the Lord tooke him
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17107:12"/>downe: well, the ſecond time, he was croſſed in his eaſe, and a roote (I cannot tell what to terme it, whether tree, or ſhrub or ſtalke; a trifle it was which he pleaſed to fancy for his turne) but would you thinke that a Prophet would chaſe at the loſſe of ſuch a thing? why, this and his heate put him into his old tune againe, he will be dead in a paſſion; God comes to pacifie him, it will not bee, hee is angry, <note place="margin">Chapter 4.</note> he hath reaſon to be angry, he will be angry, yea, would hee could burſt and kill himſelfe with anger. What is the matter? It is belike for ſome great ſinne, becauſe hee hath offended God: no (ſir) he is the plaintiffe, God had rather (in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit) treſpaſſed him: and this is <hi>Ionah;</hi> let vs ſtay in him (for we can hardly match him, and yet a good man) what may be the reaſon of theſe exceſſiue fits for outward things? <note place="margin">Reaſons 7.</note> The reaſons are many; amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt many theſe are ſome: firſt, a great miſtaking and errour in iudgement, wee ouerprize theſe outward things, and promiſe to our ſelues that from them, which neuer any found in them: and therefore wee ouer-greeue, when we are diſappointed of them. Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> thinkes <hi>Abſalom</hi> the pretieſt fellow in a country, no man had ſuch a child as was <hi>Abſalom:</hi> and therefore when he is dead, <hi>Dauid</hi> cannot liue: thus becauſe the iudgemet makes too great a report of outward things to the affection, the affection makes too great adoe about them, the one being blinded, the other is bewitched: and that is a ſecond reaſon (ſith we are fallen into it) namely the diſtemper of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, when we haue outward bleſſings we loue them but too well; and therefore when wee loſe them we greeue too much; for make a breach in one affection and you weaken all, as the whole army is weakned if any part bee diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the whole building the worſe for the remouing of ſomeone ſtone, and the whole body infeebled by the wou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of one part: Thus becauſe <hi>Dauid</hi> wil paſſe ouer his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to his ſonne in his life time, and ſettle his joy in <hi>Abſalom,</hi> he cannot be maſter of them nor command them when he is dead, hee will bee fond whilſt he hath <hi>Abſolom,</hi> no body muſt touch him, the winde muſt not blow vpon him, therefore hee will extremely lament when hee loſeth
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17107:13"/>him, and no body muſt comfort him, becauſe his <hi>Abſalom</hi> is not. Adde vnto this in the third place the deceitfulnes of our owne heart, which doth but coſen vs, and the ſubtiltie of the diuell, who to the end he may carrie vs headlong with the whirlewind of paſſion into a ſea of troubles, will beare vs in hand, that wee haue reaſon to grieue, and to bee paſſionate. Thus <hi>Ionah</hi> ſtands vnto his cauſe, and beeing drunken with paſsion, he cannot ſee but he hath the better of God: Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> (had a man cloſed hith him, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him, what he meant to be ſo loud)? would quickly haue beene his talſemaſter, what? (would hee haue ſaid) would you haue me vnſenſible of ſuch a ſtroke as this? is there no thing to be done by the pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, when the Lord thus ſingles out his child? ought not the father to take notice of it? eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially I muſt, ſith I did not the part of a father to him: he ſhould, ere this, haue beene executed for his ſinnes, I let him run on, but now the Lord hath met with him and mee too to my woe: It is iuſt vpon me, and I am perſwaded, I ought not to let it paſſe without ſome vſe; I muſt greeue: and yet, were I ſure, his ſoule were now in heauen, I would care the leſſe, but (alas) the example is ſearefull, ſo to liue, ſo to die. Faire words (good <hi>Dauid:</hi>) he ſpeakes as he thinkes (good man) but he knowes not his owne heart, is this the cauſe that you would haue died for him? was it becauſe he had ſineed? becauſe you had failed in duetie? (alas) what could your death do for his ſoule, or your owne diſcharges no, no, hee was your darling, you cannot ſpare him, you muſt alwaies beare him in your eie, hence thoſe teares: and thus we run on many times in a tale, and would faine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade our ſelues, that what we do, is done with iudgement, when (God knowes) our ſorrow is as full of fleſh as <hi>Dauids</hi> here was; and thus what through the errrour of our minds and diſorder of our affections, and deceitfulneſſe of our owne hearts, and Sathans cunning, it comes to paſſe, that we are in the depth of ſorrow and paſſion (as the Aramites in the mids of <hi>Samaria</hi>) before we know where we be.</p>
            <p>Now this being ſo, <note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> that the beſt of vs all are ſubject to immoderate ſorrow for outward things, we muſt not onely
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17107:13"/>learne to beare with one another in this our common frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but further euery one for himſelfe muſt fence and mound his heart againſt theſe abſurd paſſions and exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue griefes. Many outward things be ſo baſe, (in reſpect of man) that they ſhould not once moue him, they be not worthy his cares or thoughts, vnfit to belodged in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt roome of mans ſoule; to name them the ſame day with man, were to ſet them aboue their place; to beſtow teares on theſe, were to waſh ſtables with ſweet water, not worth the while, nor the coſt. All of them are but finite, none ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely good, and therefore our griefe for them muſt be limited with reſpects, and vſed with great moderation, els it will degenerate and turne carnall. Neither will it ſerue the turne to plead that our ſadneſſe hurts no body, but our ſelues, and that therein we are enemies to none but to our ſelues: for were this a true plea, yet were it vnſufficient; for who gaue vs a commiſſion to hurt our owne perſons, and to practiſe murther vpon our owne bodies? but this is not all, for beſides a priuate wrong, wee rob God of his glorie, and men of that ſeruice we owe vnto them; indeed, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow makes vs both vnthankful to God, and vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to man, <note place="margin">Rules. 1.</note> and vnnaturall to our ſelues (as hence might be ſhewed, but we cannot ſtand on all) and therefore let vs ſtriue againſt it. Let vs, (will ſome man ſay) let vs if we can, but how ſhould we be armed againſt the exceſſe of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow? can you giue me any preſeruatiues againſt it? Anſwere, ſome we will, many we might, but ſo farre as we practiſe theſe following, we ſhall be freed of this vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table gueſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let vs denie our ſelues in all worldly matters, and not engage our affections vnto them, either to be eagerly ſet vpon them when we haue them in chaſe, or to bee foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly puft vp with them, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue them in poſſeſſion; for if we do not leaue them, till they leaue vs, it is ſure they will leaue vs in the lurch in the end: witneſſe <hi>Dauid, Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom</hi> was gone ere <hi>Dauid</hi> had denied himſelfe in <hi>Abſalom,</hi> and therefore now here is nothing but roaring, whereas if he before had ſacrificed his name, and crucified his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17107:14"/>he would neuer haue ſtood vpon thoſe termes, ô my ſonne my ſon, what will the world ſay, that my ſonne ſhould come to this? but he would haue comforted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his GOD (as elſewhere he did) and ſaid, <note place="margin">1. Sam. 30.6.</note> It is the Lord, let him doe what ſeemeth beſt to him: and ſo, if wee could denie our ſelues in our husbands, wiues, children, names, &amp;c. we would neuer take on ſo, when wee part, my ſon, my ſon, my husband, my child, &amp;c: but as we were not doted with them whilſt we had them, ſo neither would we be diſcouraged when we loſt them. But heere is the miſery (let vs ſee it and amend it) we lay the whole ſtrength of our affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vpon the things we fancy (as the creeple laies his ful waight vpon his crutches) and therefore when they are taken from vs (as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> chariot wheeles) we are downe vpon all foure, and ſticke in the mud: yea we ſet on our affections as the Bee his ſting, with all our might and ſtrength, wee conuey vnto others our very bowels and hearts, and therefore when they are gone, we are heartles. We ſee the errour, what is the remedy? Reioice as if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reioiced not, and then we ſhall mourne as if wee mourned not; be not too glad when the ſun ſhines, and then thou wilt not be too ſad when a cloud comes. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> To this we muſt adde a ſecond thing, which in part hath beene alreadie toucht, and that is often to thinke on croſſes before they come, and to promiſe our hearts no great matters from the world, for what is the reaſon, that wee grow ſo paſſionate ſometimes but this, ô I neuer lookt for this, I neuer drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of ſuch a day? yea but whoſe fault and folly is that, not to looke for croſſes on the ſea? why ſhould wee not thinke to be croſſed as well as <hi>Dauid,</hi> and as ſoone as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid? Abſalom</hi> was luſty in the morning, dead ere night, may not the like croſſes ſteale ſuddenly on vs? but this was <hi>Dauids</hi> owne errour, he thought when God had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him a fine child, that hee muſt needs bring comfort and peace to his father, call him <hi>Abſalom,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Dauid</hi>) I hope he will be a good man and a peaceable child one day; and to ſay the truth, where ſhould a father looke for comfort ſooner then from his childe? but yet, it proues otherwiſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17107:14"/>you ſee, <hi>Abſalom</hi> is named (as they ſay Popes be) by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, his name and nature agree like a boatman and his oares, that looke two contrary waies; poore <hi>Dauid</hi> met with nothing leſſe then that hee expected. Let vs learne ſome wiſedome from his miſery, let vs not become ſureties for the world in a debt of comfort, but rather ſuſpect her and correct our ſelues, ſaying, I now take ſome comfort in this child, I ſolace my ſelfe in this outward bleſſing, but let me be moderate, who knowes what ſorrow it may breed mee ere I die? Thus if wee could forecaſt perils before they come, and bee well appointed to receiue them when they doe come, wee might better quit our ſelues in croſſes then vſually we doe; but when we are in our iollity, wee cannot heare on that ſide: O ſpare your ſpeech, or elſe you kill my heart, doe you ſay, that I muſt part with my husband, and bury my child? what my <hi>Abſalom?</hi> I hope I ſhall neuer liue to ſee that day, at leaſt not yet a while, and thus you will not heare of croſſes till they come, and then you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not beare them, becauſe they come ſo ſuddenly. Others know well enough there muſt bee a time of parting, what need you tell them that? but in the meane you muſt beare with them, for in truth they cannot chuſe but loue their friends, and take their part in all God ſends (as if there were no difference betweene louing and doting, betweene mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate drinking, and exceſſiue drunkenneſſe) and they doe not doubt, but when God calles them to croſſes, hee will fit them for croſſes, and thus they run on. But is it like lie that he wil beare afflictions patiently, who cannot with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience heare them ſpoken of? Is this the way to bee furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for winter, to ſit ſtill and ſay, if God call me to winter, he will fit me for winter, and in the meane time make no prouiſion, but ſay, whiles he ſends warme &amp; dry weather, I will take my part? No, in ſummer thou muſt thinke of winter, in thy proſperity, of aduerſity, elſe thou wilt bee ſoone in <hi>Dauids</hi> tune.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, wee muſt haue a ſpeciall eie to our dealings in outward matters, that wee do not abuſe them to Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, nor defile them with ſinne and wickednes, for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:17107:15"/>if wee be croſſed in them, we ſhall ſoundly ſmart for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe croſſes will come with a ſting; <hi>Dauid</hi> was not ſo found in the matter of <hi>Abſalom,</hi> as with more credit he might haue beene, and therefore <hi>Abſalom</hi> ſtickes by him longer then he ſhould. And (ſurely brethren) croſſes are like pinching froſts, they will ſearch, they will examine where we are moſt vnſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, we ſhal ſooneſt plaine, &amp; where moſt corruption lies, there we ſhall moſt ſhrinke when the burden comes: would wee not then greeue too much for outward things? let vs not ſin in the vſe of them: would we keepe out carnall ſorrow? keepe out curſed ſin: if we let this canker cate into our hearts, Gods medicines muſt pierce as deepe, els what recouery? build on this (brethren) ſin alwaies makes way for ſorrowe; in that meaſure that ſinne taints vs, croſſes will ſling vs; this is a true ſaying and of all men to be beleeued. But I am ſlow.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> A fourth remedy is this, we muſt breake the ſtreame of our affections, and turne our ſorrow vpon our ſin, &amp; place all our happines in Ieſus Chriſt, ſo we ſhall be ſure that our ſorrowe ſhall be alwaies moderate, ſo ſhall we be freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the worſt of ſorrowes, that which is falſe and imaginary, for true ſorrow eates vp falſe, as <hi>Aarons</hi> rod the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and falſe is euermore hurtfull and violent then true, as bugbeares more affright children then true men. Again, godly ſorrow kils worldly griefe, as ſpirituallioy mars car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall mirth: let ſin ly heauy, and outward croſſes will bee light; mourne that thou haſt diſpleaſed God and defaced his image, and thou wilt haue little leaſure to mourne for worldly matters: againe, if Chriſt be all thy ioy, and all thy comfort be ſhut vp in the Lord, thou canſt neuer bee left comfortles, ſith Chriſt euer liues in thee and for thee. But here is the ſpite, we miſtake the marke, we paſſe ſin, and ſpend our ſorrow on the world, we leaue Chriſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow our affections elſewhere, hence wee are to ſpeake of comfort when we ſhould vſe it, &amp; loſe our labour in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing amiſſe. Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> beſtirs him for <hi>Abſalom,</hi> and when all is done, he muſt vnwinde and vnwrap all againe. How happy we, if we now learne to place our ioy and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17107:15"/>aright? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Laſtly, if worldly ſorrow ſhall not beare vs downe, let vs be much in conference with God, and in the practiſe of holy dueties, pray much, abound in thankeſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing: this is <hi>Pauls</hi> preſcription to the <hi>Philip,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Chap. 4.6.</note> you may write <hi>probatum eſt</hi> vpon the head of it; for there is no croſſe ſo great vnder the cope of heauen, but praier and thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing will lighten it; as there is none ſo eaſie, but plodding and vnthankfulnes will make it heauy. Let then our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints be made to God, and let that time which is ſpent in aggrauating croſſes and vnkindneſſes, be ſpent in recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercies and deliuerances, and then croſſes will bee as ſmall in our eſteeme, as they bee in truth: and had <hi>Dauid</hi> thought on this, to haue cried, ô my ſon <hi>Salomon,</hi> in ſtead of <hi>Abſalom,</hi> and ſeene Gods mercie in the one, as well as Gods iuſtice in the other, and in this heate of paſſion draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en himſelfe into Gods preſence, and liſted vp one faithfull praier, theſe ſtormes would haue vaniſhed (as a miſt before the Sun) and he would haue ſaued himſelfe a great deale of paines: but he cannot as yet pray, and therfore as yet here is no cófort. O let our ſorrowes bring vs ſpeedily to God, and then comfort will come riding vpon the clouds to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs. Let vs preſently fall to praier and thankſgiuing as once <hi>Iob</hi> did, and betake our ſelues to the word and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or to ſome holy conference, when our fits doe come vpon vs, and we ſhall quickly breake the courſe &amp; ſtrength of them. Thus if we will learn to denie our ſelues in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, vſing them ſo, that we abuſe them not, if we will thinke on croſſes before they come, and not leaue all till afterward; if we will be iuſt in getting, and vpright in vſing the things of this life, that we do not enuenim them with ſinne; if we will beſtow our ſorrow on our ſin, &amp; make that our chiefeſt griefe and greateſt croſſe; if (laſtly) we will bee much in prater, thankſgiuing, meditation of the word, &amp;c. our ſtrength will be ſo much againſt croſſes (at leaſt) our comfort in them, that we ſhall not need to feare any hurt from them, but may comfortably expect benefit by them: fure it is, if theſe meanes keepe vs not dry-ſhod, <note place="margin">Act. 27.</note> they will keepe our head aboue water, wee ſhall bee but waſhed with

A ſecond vſe is this: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Do Gods beſt children exceed ſometimes in ſorrow for outward things: then muſt we not be altogether diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, though we find our worldly greefe more then our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſorrowe, for this is a thing that may befall the beſt, they may be immoderate in the one whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are too ſhort in the other: the beſt haue many teares to beſtow vpon ſome outward thing, when they cannot without much tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell weep for their many ſins; was not this ſometime good <hi>Dauids</hi> caſe?

Hence learne we, that Gods children, who beare ſome croſſes with great wiſedome and moderation, are ſometimes foiled in otherſome, and faile in both.

Thus <hi>Iob</hi> at that time, on that occaſion; <note place="margin">See chap. 13, 3.16.21. &amp;. 23.3.4.5 &amp;c.</note> but how afterward? who he? hee challengeth GOD into the ſchooles to diſpute it out, if he would not take the chale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17107:17"/>it was becauſe he was notable to ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnder his argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. The like may be ſaid of <hi>Ionah,</hi> a man of good behauiour; in the firſt chapter, hee makes an honeſt confeſſion both of his faith and of his fault, lettles himſelfe to die, and lookes as if hee would to heauen anon; but at another time in a ſmaller croſle, he is no more like himſelfe, then an apple is like a nut, hee chides handſmooth with God, and will ſtand to it that God knowes not when a man ſpeakes reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if he would tearme him vnreaſonable in his paſſion. But what might be the reaſon (to paſſe more inſtances) of this ſo vvide a difference? vvhat might be the cauſe that theſe ſo vvorthy champions are thus ſometimes foiled? <note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> I vvill tell you: firſt, It pleaſeth God ſometimes to ſet on a croſſe, and to make it ſtick by a man, either becauſe the ſame par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty vvould looke beſides former croſſes, or kicke them off too lightly, or elſe becauſe he vvould let him ſee himſelfe, and knovv vvhat he is of himſelfe, or for ſome other cauſe vnknovvne to vs, but alvvaies iuſt in it ſelfe, and vvell knovven to God: Now, if he purpoſe ſo to doe, either to withdraw his aſſiſtance, or to increaſe the ſmart, alas, who can ſtand vnder it? &amp; thus we ſee Gods beſt children more troubled now and then vvith a trifle (in compariſon) than vvith greateſt torments at another time; and as Chriſts looking back on <hi>Peter,</hi> did more affect him, and worke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him vvhen hee pleaſed to vvorke vvith it, then many words did at another time; ſo many times a word miſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, a countenance miſ-ſet doth more gaule vs, then twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty greater matters, (when God is pleaſed to pay vs) becauſe euer that is the croſſe which he will make the croſſe, that moſt pierceth which he ſharpeneth moſt.</p>

            <p>Now the point is prooued, let vs not ſuffer it to paſſe without ſome vſe, though we be the briefer. <note place="margin">Vſe. 1.</note> Learne hence at leaſt a double point of wiſdome: the firſt reſpects our brethren; them we muſt not too lightly cenſure for their weakneſſe and tenderneſſe in ſome croſſes though light, ſith that cannot be light, which God will make heaute; ſith that may be light to one, which is as a mountaine to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſith thoſe our brethren may manfully beare farre

            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond leſſon our ſelues muſt take forth, and make it our owne: and it lookes two waies, as if it were on both ſides the leaſe. Firſt, if wee haue in ſome meaſure quitted our ſelues well in ſome one or few afflictions, we muſt not preſently triumph and grow ſecure, as if the day were ours: wee may now giue them the fall, and by and by bee tript downe our ſelues, if we looke not to our feet. <hi>Dauid</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs herein: he fought more battles then twenty of vs, and that with great courage and good ſucceſſe, yet is not <hi>Dauid</hi> able to ſtand againſt this croſſe: his <hi>Abſalom,</hi> his <hi>Abſalom</hi> could not be forgotten. And what though wee haue buried a friend? It may be we know not what it is to burie a father, a childe, a wife, a husband. If <hi>Amnon</hi> bee dead, we cannot tell what an <hi>Abſalom</hi> may worke when his death ſhall be vntimely. Say pouertie be no great burden to vs, it may be paine and ſickneſſe will make vs roare: if theſe blow ouer, a cloud vpon our names may happilie trouble our patience: if wee can bee patient when other mens faults are ſerued into vs, and laid in our diſh, yet it may bee wee ſhall not claw it off ſo well, if our kinsfolkes, ſeruants, <note place="margin">1.

What though <hi>Dauid</hi> bee now downe? hee may riſe againe for all this, and prooue himſelfe old <hi>Dauid</hi> ſtill; though he be a little eclipſed, yet may he ſhine forth afreſh, and make many an holy praier and Pſalme after this: and though he now flie, yet may he fight and triumph againe ere hee die, and ſo maieſt thou too, though for the preſent deiected. That <hi>Peter</hi> that was once afraid of a wenches face, will not after feare the threats of any aduerſarie: and hee who is ſometimes baſe in a trifle, may after play the man in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt trials. Say not then, if I cannot beare the loſſe of a childe, of a friend, of a little wealth, a little eaſe, a little ſleepe, alas, what ſhall become of me if it ſhould come to fire and faggot? How ſhall I part (part I muſt) with my dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt pledges, and neereſt friends, and with all my goods? Yes man, heare me in one thing that I ſhall ſay, <hi>Ionah</hi> may with more patience part with his life at one time, then with a root at another: and that God that can make light croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes heauy, and ſhadowes of croſſes looke like mountaines, can (if he call thee to them hee will) make heauy croſſes light, and mountaines ſhadowes. And thus briefly for that point. Beare me companiethorow one point more, and I will trouble you no further, and will be briefe in that. For whom doth <hi>Dauid</hi> thus mourne? What is he whoſe death is thus lamented? Heare him, <hi>O my ſonne, my ſonne.</hi> Which ſonne? <hi>O Abſalom, Abſalom. Abſalom</hi> is then the man. And heerea ſtrange matter is offered to thoſe that know not the heart of a father. The ſonne practiſeth againſt his fathers houſe, robs him of his children, abuſeth him in his wiues, ſeeketh to ſpoile him both of life and liuing: and the father, what doth he? he weepes for him, hee mournes ouer him, hee would die for him: thus doth <hi>Dauid.</hi> In whom ſee what a kinde and godly fathers affection is to his childe. <note place="margin">Doct. 4.</note> No vndutifulneſſe, no practiſe on the childes part, no not death itſelfe can diuide betweene him and his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17107:19"/>child. What though <hi>Abſalom</hi> can forget <hi>Dauid?</hi> yet <hi>Dauid</hi> cannot forget him; what though hee be a very vngratious impe; yet he is my child: my child (ſaith <hi>Dauid</hi>) I cannot but loue him: and indeed he ouerloues him, which I doe not commend, but onely obſerue to note the ſtrength of parents loue if it bee naturall, a loue indeede as ſtrong as death, <note place="margin">Cant. 8.</note> as hot as fire, like that which <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeakes of in another caſe, which cannot bee put out with water, nor bought out with ſiluer: and can it be otherwiſe when pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents bee religious, ſith God and nature both command grace and nature, both enforce loue, though not fondnes? you that be parents ſaue me the proofe of this point, and do but heare why I note it.</p>
            <p>Firſt do kind and godly parents ſo loue their children, <note place="margin">Vſc. 1.</note> that you may ſooner finde too much carnall, then too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle naturall affection in them? then ſhall they neuer make it good to their owne or others ſoules, that there is any goodneſſe in them who beare no affection to their owne children. Thoſe parents that haue no naturall affection, can they be ſpiritually affected? Doth that ſpirit which makes vs louing to all, lodge in the vnnaturall breſt? Can they loue Gods children, that beare no loue to their owne bowels? Can they loue their enemies, can they call God Father, that are tyrants to their owne children, their owne fleſh? No no: it argues groſſe ſinnes, and a fierce conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when men be ſo fierce and violent againſt (mankinde I might ſay, I muſt ſay) themſelues. What, parents not to feele their children when they crie, Father? not to finde their bowels mooued when they thinke of a childe? what not of a religious childe? Why then bluſh ye Dragons, and be ye aſhamed, O Beares and Tigres, that your Lords ſhould be (ſo beaſtlike ſay I? nay) ſo diuelliſh: for what creatures but Diuels hate their ſeed? Nay could Diuels haue naturall ſeed, would they hate their owne trow yee? But why ſpend we words on them, who haue the curſe vnder ſeale, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſhewes? <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.5.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, heere is ſomewhat for children alſo. Is the affection of godly parents ſuch, that they cannot chuſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17107:19"/>but loue their children; and out of their loue, grieue at their vnkindneſſe, weepe for their impietie, mourne for their ſorrowes, and take to heart their follie? why then the children of ſuch parents muſt take to heart their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtubbornneſſe, and for the time to come forbeare thoſe practiſes that might be matter of griefe to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. How canſt thou refreſh thy ſelfe with that which is a ſword in the heart of thy deareſt friends? how canſt thou thinke to eſcape the hand of God, when thou wilt feed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bloud of thine owne parents, and make them as weary of the light as <hi>Dauid</hi> now is? Is it not ſufficient, that already they haue cared, and ſighed, and groaned, and wept for thee; but ſtill thou wilt kill their ſoules with griefe? What if thou canſt ſhake it off? Can a father ſhake out his heart? Doth their loue nothing mooue thee? nor their care, northeir paines, nor their teares? nothing? O that <hi>Abſalom</hi> had ſeene or heard his fathers complaints: he thought that now, becauſe he loued not his father, his father could not loue him: but that is thy errour (curſed viper.) The father loues, when the child hates; and then can <hi>Dauid</hi> ſay moſt feelingly, <note place="margin">5: verſe:</note>
