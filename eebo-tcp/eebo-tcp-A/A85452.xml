            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THis yeare 1629. came over three godly Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> intending to ſhew his power in his peoples loweſt condition as his manner is, thereby to ſtrengthen their Faith in following difficulties, and now although the number of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full people of Chriſt were but few, yet their longing deſires to gather into a Church was very great; And therefore addreſſed themſelves to finde out the bleſſed Rules of Chriſt for preſerving herein, who through the aſſiſtance of his Bleſſed Spirit, found that the Word of God, penned by the Apoſtles in many Epiſtles, written to particular Churches, conſiſting of ſuch as are beloved. Saints, by calling appearing ſo in the judgement of Charity, being tryed by the rule of the word, not ſcandalous in their Lives, for the ſociety of ſuch they ſought, and in theſe beginnings found ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few, ſeven being the leſt number a Church can be gathered, or conceived by juſt conſequence from the Word of God. Having faſted and prayed with humble acknowledgement of their own unworthineſſe to be called of Chriſt to ſo worthy a worke, they joyned together in a holy Covenant with the Lord, and one with another promiſing by the Lords Aſſiſtance to walke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Exhorting, Admoniſhing, and Rebuking one another, and to cleave to the Lord with a full purpoſe of heart, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the bleſſed Rules of his Word made known unto them, and further they ſeeing by light of Scripture the <hi>Lord Chriſt</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended up on high to give gifts unto men, not onely extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary as Apoſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before the Canon of the Scripture was perfected but alſo ordinary as Paſtors and Teachers, and that ſuch are to be fitted with gifts according, for ſo mighty a worke, as is the Feeding and Ruling the Flock of Chriſt. Wherefore they Elected and Ordained one Mr. <hi>Higgingſon</hi> to be Tracher of this firſt Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſet up in thoſe parts, a man indued with grace apt to teach, and mighty in the Scriptures, Learned in the Tongues, able to convince gain-ſayers, aptly applying the word to his hearers, who departed this life not long after, of whom it may be ſaid.</p>

At whoſe courage many of the Seamen wonder, not knowing under whoſe command theſe their paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were, even he who makes all his Souldiers bold as Lions, Yet was he not minded to make triall of his peoples valiantey in fight at this time, for the ſhips comming up with them proved to be their own Countrymen and friends, at which they greatly rejoyced, ſeeing the good hand of their God was upon them, and are further ſtrengthened in Faith to rely one Chriſt, for the future time againſt all Leakes, Stormes, Rockes, Sands, and all other wants a long Sea-voyage procures, ſuſtaining them with a I meekneſſe and patience, yet ſenſible of the Lords frownes, humbling their ſoules before him, and alſo rejoyeing in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverauces in taking the cup of Salvation, and paying the tribute of thankfulneſſe to the moſt high, whoſe provident hand was diverſly directed toward them, purpoſely to point out the great hardſhips they muſt undergoe in this their Chriſtian warfare, and withall to tell them, although their difficulties were many and moumfull, yet their victories ſhou'd be much more glorious and joyfull, eminently eyed of the whole World, but now keeping their courſe ſo neere as the winds will ſuffer them, the billowes begin to grow lofty and rageing, and ſuddenly bringing them into the vale of death, covering them with the formidable flouds, and daſhing their bodies from ſide to ſide, hurling their unfixed goods from place to place at theſe unwonted workes.

And further, as if theſe deliverances were too little to expreſſe the tender care <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath of his, to free them from all dangers, thoſe that occupy their buſineſſe in the deepe, and ſee the Wonders of God upon the waters, are taken with great aſtoniſhment to behold the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary hand of the moſt High, in tranſportation of this people, in that their Ships all of a ſudden are brought ſo neer the ground, and yet ſtrike not their Pilots, miſſing ofttimes of their skill on thoſe unwandered.

               <p>HEre againe the admirable Providence of the Lord is to be noted, That whereas the Country is naturally ſubject to drought, even to the withering of their ſummers Fruits, the Lord was pleaſed, during theſe yeares of ſcarcity, to bleſſe that ſmall quantity of Land they planted with ſeaſonable ſhowers, and that many times to the great admiration of the Heathen, for thus it befell: the extreame parching heare of the Sun (by reaſon of a more conſtant clearneſſe of the Aire then uſually is in <hi>England)</hi> began to ſcorch the Herbs and Fruits, which was the chiefeſt meanes of their livelyhood, they beholding the Hand of the Lord ſtretched out againſt them, like tender hearted Children, they fell down on their knees, begging mercy of the Lord, for their Saviours ſake, urging this as a chiefe argument, that the malignant adverſary would rejoyce in their deſtruction, and blaſpheme the pure Ordinances of CHRIST, trampling down his Kingly Commands with their owne inventions, and in uttering theſe words, their eyes dropped down many teares,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:119030:32"/>
their affections prevailing ſo ſtrong, that they could not refraine in the Church-Aſſembly. Here admire and be ſtrong in the Grace of Chriſt, all you that hopefully belong unto him, for as they powred out water before the Lord, ſo at that very inſtant, the Lord ſhowred down water on their Gardens and Fields, which with great induſtry they had planted, and now had not the Lord cauſed it to raine ſpeedily, their hope of food had beene loſt: but at this theſe poore wormes were ſo exceedingly taken, that the Lord ſhould ſhew himſelfe ſo neere unto their Prayers, that as the drops from Heaven fell thicker, and faſter, ſo the teares from their eyes by reaſon of the ſudden mixture of joy and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and verily they were exceedingly ſtirred in their affections, being unable to reſolve themſelves, which mercy was greateſt, to have a humble begging heart given them of God, or to have their requeſt ſo ſuddenly anſwered.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> hearing hereof, and ſeeing the ſweet raine that fell, were much taken with Engliſhmens God, but the Lord ſeeing his poore peoples hearts were to narrow to beg, his bounties exceeds toward them at this time, as indeed hee ever hitherto hath done for this Wilderneſſe-People, not onely giving the full of their requeſts, but beyond all their thoughts, as witneſſe his great worke in <hi>England</hi> of late, in which the prayers of Gods people in <hi>New England</hi> have had a great ſtroke; Theſe people now riſing from their knees to receive the rich mercies of Chriſt, in the refreſhed fruits of the Earth; Behold the Sea alſo bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in whole Ship-loades of mercies, more being filled with freſh forces, for furthering this wonderfull worke of Chriſt, and indeed this yeare came in many pretious ones, whom Chriſt in his grace hath made much uſe of in theſe his Churches, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, inſomuch that theſe people were even almoſt over-ballanced with the great income of their preſent poſſeſſed mercies, yet they addreſſe themſelves to the Sea ſhore, where they courteouſly welcom the famous ſervant of Chriſt, grave god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and judicious <hi>Hooker,</hi> and the honoured ſervant of Chriſt, M <hi>John Haynes,</hi> as alſo the Reverend and much deſired Mr. <hi>John Cotton,</hi> and the Retoricall, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Stone,</hi> with divers others of the ſincere ſervants of Chriſt, comming with their young, and with their old, and with their whole ſubſtance, to doe him ſervice in

this Deſart wilderneſſe. Thus this poore people having now taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed liberally of the ſalvation of the Lord every way, they deeme it high time to take up the Cup of thankfulneſſe, and pay their vowes to the moſt high God, by whom they were holpen to this purpoſe of heart, and accordingly ſet apart the 16. day of <hi>October</hi> (which they call the eighth Moneth, not out of any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh humor of ſingularity, as ſome are ready to cenſor them with, but of purpoſe to prevent the Heatheniſh and Popiſh ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Dayes, Moneths and Yeares, that they may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten among the people of the Lord) this day was ſolemnly kept by all the ſeven Churches, rejoycing in the Lord, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering thanks for all their benefits.</p>

The people of this Church and Towne have hitherto had the chiefeſt ſhare in ſpitituall bleſſings, the Miniſtry of the Word, by more then ordinary inſtruments as in due time and place (God willing) you ſhall farther heare, yet are they at this day in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ate and Sheepe, of which they have a good flocke, which the Lord hath cauſed to thrive much in theſe latter dayes then formerly.</p>
               <p>This Towne was appointed to be the ſeate of Government, but it continued not long, this yeare a ſmall gleane of Rye was brought to the Court as the firſt fruits of Engliſh graine at which this poore people greatly rejoyced to ſee the Land would beare it, but now the Lords bleſſing that way hath exceeded all peoples expectation, cloathing the Earth with plenty of all kinde of graine. Here minde I muſt the Reader of the admirable acts of Chriſts Providence toward this people, that although they were in ſuch great ſtraites for foode, that many of them eate their Bread by waight, and had little hopes of the Earths fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe, yet the Lord Chriſt was pleaſed to refreſh their ſpirits with ſuch quickning grace, and lively affections to this Temple-worke, that they did not deſert the place; and that which was more remarkable, when they had ſcarce houſes to ſhelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and no doores to hinder the <hi>Indians</hi> acceſſe to all they had in them, yet did the Lord ſo awe their hearts, that although they frequented the <hi>Engliſhmens</hi> places of aboade, where their whole ſubſtance, weake Wives and little ones lay open to their plunder; during their abſence being whole dayes at Sabbath. Aſſemblies, yet had they none of their food or ſtuffe diminiſhed, neither Children nor Wives hurt in the leaſt meaſure, although the <hi>Indians</hi> came commonly to them at thoſe times, much hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry belly (as they uſe to ſay) and were then in number and ſtrength beyond the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by far.</p>
               <p>Yet further ſee the great and noble Acts of Chriſt toward this his wandering people, feeling againe the ſcarcity of foode, and being conſtrained to come to a ſmall pittance daily, the Lord to provide for them, cauſeth the Deputy of <hi>Ireland</hi> to ſet forth a great Ship unknowne to this people, and indeed ſmall reaſon in his own apprehenſions why he ſhould ſo do (but Chriſt will
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:119030:34"/>
have it ſo.) This Ship ariving, being filled with food, the godly Governors did ſo order it that each Town ſent two men aboard of her, who tooke up their Townes allowance, it being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed before hand, what their portion ſhould be, to this end that ſome might not by all, and others be left deſtitute of food.

This Towne is ſcituated on a faire and delightfull River, whoſe firſt riſe or ſpring begins about five and twenty Miles farther up in the Countrey, iſſuing forth a very pleaſant pond. But ſoone after it betakes its courſe through a moſt hideous ſwamp of large extent, even for many Miles, being a great Harbour for Beares: after its comming forth this place, it groweth larger by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of many ſmall Rivers, and iſſues forth in the Sea, due Eaſt over againſt the Iſland of <hi>Sholes,</hi> a great place of fiſhing for out <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, the peopling of this Towne is by men of good ranke and quality, many of them having the yearly Revenue of large Lands in <hi>England</hi> before they came to this Wilderneſſe, but their Eſtates being imployed for Chriſt, and left in banke, as you have formerly heard, they are well content till Chriſt ſhall be pleaſed to-reſtore it againe to them or theirs, which in all reaſon ſhould be out of the Prelates Lands in <hi>England.</hi> Let all thoſe, whom it concernes (to judge) conſider it well, and do Juſtice herein.</p>

then being given over as quite loſt, after three dayes and nights, the Lord was pleaſed to bring her feeble body to her own home in ſafety, to the great admiration of all that heard of it. This intricate worke no whit daunted theſe reſolved ſervants of Chriſt to goe on with the worke in hand, but lying in the open aire, while the watery Clouds poure down all the night ſeaſon, and ſometimes the driving Snow diſſolving on their backs, they keep their wee cloathes warme with a continued fire, till the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed morning give freſh opportunity of further travell; after they have thus found out a place of aboad, they burrow themſelves in the Earth for their firſt ſhelter under ſome Hill-ſide, caſting the Earth aloft upon Timber; they make a ſmoaky fire againſt the Earth at the higheſt ſide, and thus theſe poore ſervants of Chriſt provide ſhelter for themſelves, their Wives and little ones, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the ſhort ſhowers from their Lodgings, but the long raines penetrate through, to their great diſturbance in the night ſeaſon: yet in theſe poore <hi>Wigwames</hi> (they ſing Pſalmes, pray and praiſe their God) till they can provide them houſes, which ordinarily was not wont to be with many till the Earth, by the Lorde bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, brought forth Bread to feed them, their Wives and little ones, which with ſore labours they attaine every one that can lift a hawe to ſtrike it into the Earth, ſtanding ſtoutly to their labours, and teare up the Rootes and Buſhes, which the firſt yeare beares them a very thin crop, till the ſoard of the Earth be rotten, and therefore they have been forced to cut their bread very thin for a long ſeaſon.

               <p>ANd now to follow our firſt ſimile of a Souldier, the Lord Chriſt having ſafely landed many a valiant Souldier of his on theſe Weſterne ſhores, drawes hither alſo the common enemies to Reformation, both in Doctrine and Diſcipline; But it was for like end, as the Lord ſometime drew <hi>Siſera</hi> the Captaine of <hi>Jabins</hi> army to the River <hi>Kiſhon</hi> for their deſtruction, onely herein was a wide difference; there <hi>Siſera</hi> was delivered into the hands of a Woman, and here <hi>Siſera</hi> was a woman; their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons and warre was carnall, theſe ſpirituall; there <hi>Jabin</hi> was but a man, here <hi>Jabin</hi> was the common enemy of mans ſalvation.</p>
               <p>In the yeare 1636. the Angels of the ſeverall Churches of Chriſt in <hi>N. England</hi> ſounding forth their ſilver Trumpets, heard ever and anon the jarring ſound of ratling Drums in their eares, ſtriking up an alarum to the battell, it being a frequent thing publikely to oppoſe the pure and perfect truths of Chriſt (deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the mouth of his Miniſters) and that by way of queſtion as the Phariſes, Sadduces and Herodians did Chriſt. But to bring this diſorderly worke of theirs into ſome order, for aſſuredly could the Author come up to relate the full of the matter in hand, it would through the mercy of Chriſt make much for the good of Gods people the World throughout, and helpe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the laſt (I hope) but moſt ſubtile practiſes of Satan to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Reſtauration of the purity of Chriſts Ordinances in his Churches in all places; As alſo uſed by him and his inſtruments
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:119030:48"/>
to divert the hands of thoſe, to whom it belongs, from pulling downe Antichriſt, to which end he ſtirreth up ſome of his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (well educated in the Masking ſchoole of Hippocriſy) to take upon them this long Voyage, giving them in charge by all meanes to carry it more cloſe, then his Jeſuites had done, and for their paines they ſhould have the honours to be counted ſuch, as were of a ſharper fight, and deeper diſcerning then any others. Satan, knowing right well that at the fall of Antichriſt hee muſt be chained up for a thouſand years, ſtrives with all the wicked craft his long experienced maliciouſneſſe could poſſibly invent, to uphold the ſame, having already perſwaded many that his Kingdome was wholy ruinated with our Engliſh Nation, and ſo diſwaded them a long time from further proſecuting againſt him. But Antichriſts Kingdome, as it plainly appeares by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, conſiſts chiefly in two parts, his deceaveible Doctrines, and his Kingly power. The firſt of theſe being in meaſure aboliſhed, the latter was ſtill retained by the Prelacy, and ſome Lording Presbytery in greater or leſſer meaſure, as they could attaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
               <p>Now Satan, who is daily walking to and fro compaſſing the Earth, ſeeing how theſe reſolved Souldiers of Chriſt in <hi>New England</hi> with indefatigable paines laboured, not onely the finall ruine of Antichriſt, in both, but alſo the advance of Chriſts Kingdome, in ſeting up daily Churches according to his firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Wherefore he ſets upon a new way to ſtop (if it were poſſible) this worke of Reformation, and ſeeing no other way will ſerve, he ſtirs up inſtruments to cry down Antichriſt as much as the moſt, I and more too, but by this project they ſhould leade people as much out of the way on the other hand, and in the Doctrinall part of Antichriſts Kingdome, fall to more hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Blaſphemies then the Papiſt (as God willing) you ſhall heare ſome of them did, namely the <hi>Gorteniſt,</hi> who moſt blaſphemouſly profeſſe themſelves to be perſonally the Chriſt: and as for the other part of his Kingdome, namely the power or Dominion of the beaſt, this they ſhould with all violence batter downe alſo, but it muſt be none other then to make way for their owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation, and pay them their wages in the former page promiſed them, as alſo withall to overthow the authority Chriſt hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:119030:49"/>
to be continued in his Churches, in and under him, and furthermore to lock up the Sword of Civill Government for ever, eſpecially in matters that concerne the foure firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, a cunning way to ſave the beaſts head whole.</p>

The <hi>Lord Chriſt</hi> in his boundleſſe mercy give all his people eyes to ſee, and hearts to believe, that after they have in meaſure eſcaped the filthy pollutions of the beaſt, they may not againe be intangled with theſe damnabled Doctrines, ſtealing away their hearts by degrees, under a ſeeming ſhew of pulling down Antichriſt. The Embaſſadors of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> having full li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to deliver their maſters minde, Preach unto all the Doctrine of Free grace, beſeeching them to be reconciled unto God in Chriſt, and that the revealed will of God is, that all ſhould be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth, and that God hath given his onely begotten Son, <hi>That whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life.</hi> Yet withall mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them that Faith is the gift of God, and none can come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, but ſuch as the Father drawes, and withall that the whole will not ſee any need of the Phiſicians, but the ſick, adding alſo that none can come to the ſight of his ſickneſſe or dead con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition but by the Law of God, unleſſe they be quicker ſighted then the Apoſtle; They indevour alſo to build up others in their holy Faith, that they might come to ſee the Love of God in Chriſt, which paſſeth knowledge, and to this end they ſhew them the fruits of Faith which worketh by love, and that love will be obedient to all the commands of Chriſt, who ſaith, <hi>if you love me keepe my Commandements;</hi> And further that Faith purifies the heart, and that a conſtant ſupply muſt be had from Chriſt.

of it: but that you may underſtand their way of broaching their abominable errors, it was in dividing thoſe things the Lord hath united in his worke of converſion continued, carrying on a Soule to Heaven in theſe foure Particulars.</p>

Here's nothing ſayes one of them, but Preaching out of the Law and the Prophets, truly ſayes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of them I have not heard a pure Goſpell Sermon from any of them, but ſure they were both troubled with the Lethargy, or read not the Goſpell themſelves, for they may finde the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, yea, and Chriſt himſelfe Preached good Goſpell ſure, out of the Law and the Prophets.</p>

Oh quoth he where am I become, is this the place where theſe Reverend Preachers are fled, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was pleaſed to make uſe of to rouſe up his rich graces in many a drooping ſoule; here have I met with ſome that tell mee, I muſt take a naked <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Oh, woe is mee if <hi>Chriſt</hi> be naked to mee, wherewith ſhall I be cloathed, but me thinks I moſt wonder they tell me of caſting of all godly ſorrow for ſin as unbeſeeming a Soule, that is united to <hi>Chriſt</hi> by Faith, and there was a little nimbled tongued Woman among them, who ſaid ſhe could bring me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with one of her own Sex that would ſhew me a way, if I could attaine it, even Revelations, full of ſuch raviſhing joy that I ſhould never have cauſe to be ſorry for ſinne, ſo long as I live, and as for her part ſhee had attained it already: a company of legall Profeſſors, quoth ſhe lie poring on the Law which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath aboliſhed, and when you breake it then you breake your joy, and now no way will ſerve your turne, but a deepe ſorrow.

               <p>ANd here Chriſtian Reader the Author according to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer practice, muſt minde thee of the admirable providence of Chriſt toward his <hi>New England</hi> Churches, in preſerving them from theſe erronious ſpirits, that have hitherto in all places dog'd the ſincere ſervants of Chriſt, when ever they have ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a through Reformation, as ſtories doe abundantly teſtify, which thing the reverend <hi>Calvine</hi> and divers others, have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But ſeeing the boaſting Prelates in theſe times are ready to ſay their Lordly power kept theſe errours under, its plaine otherwiſe: for Satan ſaw while people were under their yoake of humane inventions, they were far enough from exalting the Kingdome of Chriſt; And therefore he reſerved theſe errours, for his laſt ſhifts, and further you ſhall ſee in the following ſtory that the <hi>Lord Chriſt</hi> reſerved this honour for thoſe, whoſe love hee had inlarged to follow him in a dezart wilderneſſe, even with the ſharpe ſword of the Word, timely to cut off the heads of this <hi>Hidra;</hi> but yet there are two ſorts of perſons in our Native Country, whom the Elders and Brethren here do highly honour in Chriſt, and prefer before themſelves, namely the godly Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian party, and the Congregationall ſincere ſervants of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> both which the Author could wiſh, (that with bowells of compaſſion, ſweet ſimpathiſing affection of Brethren knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that tranſcendent love of Chriſt, which couples all his diſtanced flockes together) they would ſeriouſly ponder this Hiſtory, which through the Authors weakeneſſe wants much of meaſure, but nothing of the truth of things, ſo far as a ſhallow capacity can reach.

Now that I would they ſhould take notice of is, that the Churches of Chriſt in <hi>New England,</hi> and their Officers have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been ſo far from imbracing the erronious Doctrines of theſe times, that through the powers of Chriſt they have vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly defended the truth, and cut down all deceiveable Doctrine; the like hath not been done for many ages heretofore. Reverend and beloved in Chriſt, could your eyes but behold the efficacy of loving counſell in the Communion of congregationall Churches, and the reverend reſpect, honour and love, given to all Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Elders, charity commands me to thinke you would never ſtand for Claſſicall injunctions any more, neither Dioceſan, nor Provinciall authority can poſſible reach ſo far as this royall Law of love in communion of Churches: verily its more univerſall then the Papall power, and aſſuredly the dayes are at hand, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> Churches ſhall exerciſe this old Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell of Church Government, and ſend their Church ſalutations and admonitions from one end of the World unto another, when the Kingdomes of the Earth are become our <hi>Lord Chriſts;</hi> Then ſhall the exhortation of one Church to another prevaile more to Reformation, then all the thundering Bulls, excomuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating Lordly cenſures, and ſhamefull penalties of all the Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Churches in the World, and ſuch ſhall be, and is the efficacy of this intire love one to another, that the withdrawing of any one Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> according to the Rule of the word from thoſe that walke inordinatly, will be more terrible to the Church or Churches ſo forſaken, then an Army with Banners: yea, and it may be added, becauſe civill Government is like to turne nurſe in more places then one, this royall Law of love ſhall become the Law of Nations, and none will ſuffer their ſubjects to rebell againſt it; but to our beloved brethren in <hi>England</hi> on the other hand, the Reverend M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Burroughs,</hi> Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Indian King hearing of their comming, gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his chiefe Counſellors, and a great number of his Subjects to give them entertainment, reſolving as then that the young King ſhould receive their meſſage, yet in his hearing, they arriving, were entertain'd royally, with reſpect to the Indian manner. Boil'd Cheſnuts is their White-bread, which are very ſweet, as if they were mixt with Sugar; and becauſe they would be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary in their feaſting, they ſtrive for variety after the Engliſh manner, boyling Puddings made of beaten corne, putting therein great ſtore of black berryes, ſomewhat like Currants.

old <hi>Canonicus,</hi> who was very diſcreet in his anſwers. The young Sachem was indeed of a more lofty ſpirit, which wrought his ruine, as you may heare, after the deceaſe of the old King. But at this time his anſwer was, that he did willingly embrace peace with the Engliſh, conſidering right well, that although their number was but ſmall in compariſon of his people, and that they were but ſtrangers to the Woods, Swamps, and advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous places of this Wilderneſſe, yet withall he knew the Engliſh were advantaged by their weapons of War, and eſpecially their Guns, which were of great terror to his people, and alſo he had heard they came of a more populous Nation by far than all the Indians were, could they be joyn'd together. Alſo on the other hand, with mature deliberation, he was well adviſed of the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quods cruell diſpoſition and aptneſſe to make War, as alſo their neere neighbourhood to his people, who though they were more numerous, yet were they withall more effeminate, and leſſe able to defend themſelves from the ſudden incurſions of the <hi>Peaquods,</hi> ſhould they fall out with them. Hereupon hee demes it moſt conducing to his owne, and his peoples ſafety to direct his courſe in a middle way, holding amity with both. The <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> returne home, having gained the old Kings favour ſo farre, as rather to favour them then the <hi>Pequods,</hi> who perceiving their Neighbouring <hi>Engliſh</hi> had ſent forth aid to the <hi>Mattacuſets</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, thought it high time to ſeeke the winning all the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> they could on their ſide, and among others they make their addreſſe to old <hi>Cannonicus,</hi> who, inſteed of taking part with them, labours all he can to huſh the War in hand, laying before them the ſad effects of War; ſometimes proving ſad and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the very Victors themſelves, but alwayes to the vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and withall tells them what potent enemies they had to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with, whoſe very weapons and Armor were matter of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, ſetting their perſons a ſide; as alſo that Engliſh man was no much hoggery yet, and therefore they might ſoone appeaſe them, by delivering into their hands thoſe perſons that had beene the death of any of them, which were much better than that the whole Nation ſhould periſh.</p>

rude multitude (the chief place of cowardly boaſting) they ſoon change their minde; yet the old <hi>Sachim</hi> ſends the <hi>Engliſh</hi> word he had wrought with them, and in very deed, the Engliſh had rather make choice of Peace then Warre, provided it may ſtand with Truth and Righteouſneſſe: and therefore ſend forth a band of Souldiers, who arriving in the <hi>Peaquod</hi> Country, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs themſelves to have a Treaty with them about delivering up the murtherers; they making ſhew of willingneſs ſo to doe, bade them abide awhile and they would bring them, and in the mean time they were converſant among the Souldiers, and view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Armie, pointed to divers places where they could hit them with their Arrowes for all their Corſlets. But their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt number lying the while at the other ſide of a great hill, and anon appearing on the top of the hill, in ſight of the Engliſh: thoſe Indians that were among the Engliſh withdrawing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them; no ſooner were they come to their Companions, but all of a ſuddaine they gave a great ſhout, and ſhewed the Engliſh a fair pair of heeles, who ſeeing it, would not availe any thing to follow them (they being farre ſwifter of foot than the Engliſh) made their returne home againe.</p>
               <p>This bootleſſe voyage incouraged the Indians very much, who inſulted over them at the fort, boaſting of this their deluding them, and withall, they blaſphemed the Lord, ſaying, Engliſh-mans God was all one Flye, and that Engliſh man was all one Sqawe, and themſelves all one Moor-hawks. Thus by their horrible pride they fitted themſelves for deſtruction. The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh hearing this report, were now full aſſured that the Lord would deliver them into their hands to execute his righteous judgement upon theſe blaſphemous murtherers; and therefore raiſed freſh Souldiers for the warre, to the number of fourſcore, or thereabout, out of the ſeverall towns in the <hi>Matachuſets,</hi> and although they were but in their beginnings, yet the Lord, who fore-intended their work, provided for all their wants, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was much that they had any bisket to carry with them in theſe times of ſcarcity, or any veſſels to tranſport their men and ammunition: yet all was provided by the gracious hand of the moſt high; and the Souldiers, many of them, not onely armed with outward weapons, and armour of defence, but filled with

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:119030:69"/>
were now a feaſting it at their fort, which was hard at hand; the Engliſh calling a Councill of warre, being directed by the ſpecialleſt providence of the moſt high God, they concluded to ſtorm the fort a little before break of day; at whith time they ſuppoſed the Indians being up late in their jolly feaſting, would bee in their deepeſt ſleepe; and ſurely ſo it was, for they now ſlept their laſt: the Engliſh keeping themſelves as covertly as they could, approached the fort at the time appointed, which was builded of whole Trees ſet in the ground faſt, and ſtanding up an end about twelve foot high, very large, having pitcht their Wigwams within it, the entrance being on two ſides, with intricate Meanders to enter. The chiefe Leaders of the Engliſh made ſome little ſtand before they offered to enter, but yet boldly they ruſhed on, and found the paſſages guarded at each place with an Indian Bow-man, ready on the ſtring, they ſoone let fly, and wounded the for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> moſt of the Engliſh in the ſhoulder, yet having diſpatch'd the Porters, they found the winding way in without a Guide, where they ſoone placed themſelves round the Wigwams, and according to direction they made their firſt ſhot with the muz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle of their Muskets downe to the ground, knowing the Indian manner is to lie on the ground to ſleep, from which they being in this terrible manner awakened, unleſſe is were ſuch as were ſlaine with the ſhot.</p>
               <p>After this ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> entred the Wigwams, where they received ſome ſhot with their Arrowes, yet catching up the fire brands, they began to fire them, and others of the Engliſh Soulders with powder, did the ſame: the day now began to break; the Lord intending to have theſe murtherers know he wou'd looke out of the cloudy pillar upon them: and now theſe women and children ſet up a terrible out-cry; the men were ſmitten down, and flaine, as they came forth with a great ſlaughter, the <hi>Sqawes</hi> crying out, oh much winn it Engliſh-man, who moved with pitty toward them, ſaved their lives: and hereupon ſome young youth cryed, I ſquaw, I ſquaw, thinking to finde the like mercy. There were ſome of theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, as is reported, whoſe bodyes were not to be pierced by their ſharp rapiers of ſwords of a long time, which made ſome
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:119030:69"/>
of the Souldiers think the Devil was in them, for there were ſome <hi>Powwowes</hi> among them, which work ſtrange things, with the help of Satan. But this was very remarkable, one of them being wounded to death, and thruſt thorow the neck with a halbert; vet after all, lying groaning upon the ground, he caught the halberts ſpeare in his hand, and wound it quite round. After the Engliſh were thus poſſeſſed of this firſt victory, they ſent their priſoners to the pinnaces, and proſecute the warre in hand, to the next Battalia of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, which lay on a hill about two miles diſtant, and indeed their ſtouteſt Souldiers were at this place, and not yet come to the fort; the Engliſh being weary with their night worke, and wanting ſuch refreſhing as the preſent worke required, began to grow faint, yet having obtained one victory, they were very deſirous of another: and further, they knew right-well, till this curſed crew were utterly rooted out, they ſhould never be at peace; therefore they marched on toward them. Now aſſuredly, had the Indians knowne how much weakned our Souldiers were at preſent, they might have born them downe with their multitude, they being very ſtrong and agile of body, had they come to handy-gripes; but the Lord (who would have his people know their work was his, and he onely muſt order their Counſels, and war like work for them) did bring them timely ſupply from the veſſels, and alſo gave them a ſecond victory, wherein they ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ew many more of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, the reſidue flying into a very thick ſwamp, being unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible, by reaſon of the boggy holes of water, and thick buſhes; the Engliſh drawing up their company beleagered the ſwamp, and the Indians in the mean time skulking up and down, and as they ſaw opportunity they made ſhot with their Arrowes at the Engliſh, and then ſuddainly they would fall flat along in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to defend themſelves from the retalliation of the Souldiers Muskets. This laſted not long, for our Engliſh being but a ſmall number, had parted themſelves far aſunder, but by the providence of the moſt high God, ſome of them ſpyed an Indian with a kettle at his back going more inwardly into the ſwamp, by which they perceived there was ſome place of firm land in the midſt thereof, which cauſed them to make way for the paſſage
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:119030:70"/>
of their Souldiers, which brought this warre to a period: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many got away, yet were they no ſuch conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber as ever to raiſe warre any more; the ſlaine or wounded of the Engliſh were (through the mercy of Chriſt) but a few: One of them being ſhot through the body, neere about the breaſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding it not till of a long time after, which cauſed the bloud to dry and thicken on eitheir end of the arrow ſo that it could not be drawne forth his body without great difficulty and much paine, yet did he ſcape his life, and the wound healed. Thus the Lord was pleaſed to aſſiſt his people in this warre, and deliver them out of the Indians hands, who were very luſty proper men of their hands, moſt of them, as may appear by one paſſage which I ſhall here relate: thus it came to paſſe, As the Souldiers were uppon their march, cloſe by a great thicket, where no eye could penetrate farre, as it often falls out in ſuch weariſom wayes, where neither men nor beaſt have beaten out a path; ſome Souldiers lingering behinde their fellowes, two Indians watching their opportunity, much like a hungry hauke, when they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the laſt man was come up, who kept a double double double diſtance in his march, they ſudden and ſwiftly ſnatched him up in their tallens, hoiſing him upon their ſhoulders, ran into the ſwamp with him; the Souldier unwilling to be made a Pope by being borne on mens ſhoulders, ſtrove with them all he could to free himſelfe from their hands; but, like a carefull Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, one Captaine <hi>Davenport,</hi> then Lieutenant of this company, being diligent in his place to bring up the reare, coming up with them, followed with ſpeed into the ſwamp after him, having a very ſevere cutlace tyed to his wriſt, and being well able to make it bite ſore when he ſet it on, reſolving to make it fall foul on the Indians bones, he ſoone overtook them, but was preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the buckler they held up from hitting them, which was the man they had taken: It was matter of much wonder to ſee with what dexterity they hurled the poore Souldier about, as if they had been handling a <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> ſhield, ſo that the nimble Captaine <hi>Davenport</hi> could not, of a long time, faſten one ſtroke upon them; yet, at laſt, dying their tawny skin into a crimſon co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, they caſt downe their prey, and haſted thorow the thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets for their lives. The Souldier thus redeemed, had no ſuch
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:119030:70"/>
hard uſage, but that he is alive, as I ſuppoſe, at this very day: The Lord in mercy toward his poore Churches having thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed theſe bloudy barbarous Indians, he returnes his people in ſafety to their veſſels, where they take account of their priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: the <hi>Squawes</hi> and ſome young youths they brought home with them, and finding the men to be deeply guilty of the crimes they undertooke the warre for, they brought away onely their heads as a token of their victory. By this means the Lord ſtrook a trembling terror into all the Indians round about, even to this very day.</p>

               <p>THe Lord Chriſt deeming it moſt expedient for his people to adde ſome farther help to aſſiſt them in cutting downe thoſe curſed errors (that were the next dangerous difficulty they were to meet with) ſends in the Reverend and bright ſhining light Mr. <hi>Davenport,</hi> and the cheerfull, grave, and gracious Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of his, Mr. <hi>Allen,</hi> as alſo Mr. <hi>Thompſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Browne,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fiſh,</hi> with divers other of the faithfull ſervants of Chriſt, the much honoured Mr. <hi>Eaton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hopkins:</hi> and now the time being come, the Synod ſate at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where was preſent about 25. Reverend and godly Miniſters of Chriſt, beſides many other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly-eminent ſervants of his. A Catalogue of the ſeverall Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors ſcattered about the Countrey was there produced, to the number of 80. and liberty given to any man to diſpute <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>con,</hi> and none to be charged to be of that opinion he diſputed for, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he ſhould declare himſelfe ſo to be. The Weapons theſe Souldiers of Chriſt warred with, was the Sword of the Spirit, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Word of God, together with earneſt prayer to the God of all Truth, that he would open his truths unto them. The clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the true ſenſe and meaning of any place of Scripture, it was done by Scripture, for they ſo diſcerned by the grace of God

that was given them, that the whole Scripture muſt be attended unto. Foure ſorts of perſons I could with a good will have paid their paſſage out, and home againe to <hi>England,</hi> that they might have been preſent at this Synod, ſo that they would have repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the truth of all the paſſages thereof to their own Colledges at their return. The firſt is the Prelates, who both in Theorie and Practice might have made their owne Eyes Judges in the caſe, Whether would prevaile moſt, (to the ſuppreſſing of Error, and advancing of Unity in the true worſhip of God) either their commanding power backt with the ſubordinate ſword of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or the Word of God cleered up by the faithfull labour and indefatigable pains of the ſincere ſervants of the Lord Chriſt, and mightily declared through the demonſtration of his bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. This well waighed, may (through the Lords bleſſing) ſtop the yet running fancie in the brains of many, that their Lordly power is the onely means of ſuppreſſing Error.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Godly and Reverend Presbyterian Party, who, had they made their eye-witneſſes of this worke, they had aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly ſaved themſelves much labour, which I dare preſume they would have ſpent worthily otherwayes, then in writing ſo many books to prove the Congregationall or Independant Churches to be the ſluce, through which ſo many flouds of Error flow in: nay, my deare and reverend brethren, might not ſo much work of yours in writing, and ours in anſwering, have been a meanes to have ſtopt the height of this overflowing floud? and through the Lords aſſiſting have ſetled Peace and Truth in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure throughout the three Nations.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, thoſe who with their new ſtratagems have brought in ſo much old error; for although they had a party here, yet verily they durſt not bring their New Light to the Old Word, for fear it would prove but Old Darkneſſe, (as indeed they doe.) But here might they have ſeene the Miniſters of Chriſt (who were ſo experienced in the Scripture, that ſome of them could tell you the place, both Chapter and Verſe, of moſt ſentences of Scripture could be named unto them) with Scriptures light, cleering up the truths of Chriſt clouded by any of theſe Errors and Hereſies, as had not been done for many Ages before: and verily this great work of Chriſt muſt not be lightly over-paſt, the Author of this

               </head>
               <p>THis yeare, the firſt day of the Fourth Month, about two of the clock in the after-noone, the Lord caus'd a great and terrible Earth quake, which was generall throughout all the Engliſh Plantations; the motion of the Earth was ſuch, that it cauſed divers men (that had never knowne an Earth quake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) being at worke in the Fields, to caſt downe their working-tooles, and run with gaſtly terrified lookes, to the next com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany they could meet withall; it came from the Weſterne and uninhabited parts of this Wilderneſſe, and went the direct courſe: this brood of Travellers came, the Miniſters of Chriſt many of them could ſay at that very time (not from any other Revelation, but what the word holds forth) that if the Churches of <hi>New England</hi> were Gods houſe, then ſuddenly there would follow great alterations in the Kingdomes of Europe.</p>
               <p>This yeare the civill government proceeded to cenſure the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue of thofe ſinfull erroneous perſons, who raiſed much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion

in this little Common-wealth; who being baniſhed, reſorted to a place more Southward, ſome of them ſitting down at a place called Providence, others betooke them to an Iſland about 16. miles diſtant from the former, called <hi>Rode</hi> Iſland, where having Elbow roome enough, none of the Miniſters of Chriſt, nor any other to interrupt their falſe and deceivable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, they hamper'd themſelves fouly with their owne line, and ſoone ſhewed the depthleſſe ditches that blinde guides lead into; many among them being much to be pittyed, who were drawne from the truth by the bewitching tongues of ſome of them being, very ignorant and eaſily perverted: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the people were not many in all, yet were they very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe in their opinions, and glad where they could gaine moſt Diſciples to heare them; ſome were for every day to be a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and therefore kept not any Sabbath-day at all; others were ſome for one thing, ſome for another; and therefore had their ſeverall meetings, making many a goodly piece of Preachment; among whom there were ſome of the female ſexe (who deeming the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to be too ſtrict in not permitting a roome to preach in the publique Congregation) taught, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they having their call to this office, from an ardent deſire of being famous, eſpecially the grand Miſtreſſe of them all, who ordinarily prated every Sabbath day, till others, who thirſted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter honour in the ſame way with her ſelfe, drew away her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, and then ſhe withdrew her ſelf, her husband, and her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily alſo, to a more remote place; and aſſuredly, although the Lord be ſecret in all the diſpenſation of his providences, whether in judgement or mercy, yet much may be learn'd from all, as ſometimes pointing with the finger to the leſſon; as here theſe perſons withdrawing from the Churches of Chriſt (wherein he walketh, and is to be found in his bleſſed Ordinances) to a firſt and ſecond place, where they came to a very ſad end; for thus it came to paſſe in the latter place, The Indians in thoſe parts for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned them of making their abode there; yet this could be no warning to them, but ſtill they continued, being amongſt a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Indians, boaſted they were become all one Indian: and indeed, this woman, who had the chiefe rule of all the roaſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very bold in her ſtrange Revelations and miſ-applications,

tells them, though all nations and people were cut off round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, yet ſhould not they; till on a day certaine Indians coming to her houſe, diſcourſing with them, they wiſhed to tye up her doggs, for they much bit the man, not miſtruſting the Indians guile, did ſo; the which no ſooner done, but they cruelly murthered her, taking one of their daughters away with them, &amp; another of them ſeeking to eſcape is caught, as ſhe was getting over a hadge, and they drew her back againe by the haire of the head to the ſtump of a tree, and there cut off her head with a hatchet; the other that dwelt by them betook them to boat, and fled, to tell this ſad newes; the reſt of their companions, who were rather hardened in their ſinfull way, and blaſphemous opinions, than brought to any ſight of their damnable Errours, as you ſhall after hear; yet was not this the firſt loud ſpeaking hand of God againſt them; but before this the Lord had poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted directly to their ſinne by a very fearfull Monſter, that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe women brought forth, they ſtriving to bury it in oblivion, but the Lord brought it to light, ſetting forth the view of their monſtrous Errors in this prodigious birth. This yeare, although the eſtates of theſe pilgrim people were much waſted, yet ſeeing the benefit that would accrew to the Churches of Chriſt and Civil Government, by the Lords bleſſing, upon lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they began to erect a Colledge, the Lord by his provident hand giving his approbation to the work, in ſending over a faithfull and godly ſervant of his, the reverend Mr <hi>John Harverd,</hi> who joyning with the people of Chriſt at <hi>Charles Towne,</hi> ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly after departed this life, and gave near a thouſand pound toward this work; wherefore the Government thought it meet to call it <hi>Harverd</hi> Colledge in remembrance of him.</p>

               <p>THis yeare came over divers godly and ſincere ſervants of Chriſt, as I ſuppoſe, among whom came over the reverend godly M. <hi>Peirſon:</hi> This people finding no place in any of the former erected Colonies to ſettle in, to their preſent content, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to an Iſland, ſevered from the continent of <hi>Newhaven,</hi> with about 16. miles off the ſalt Sea, and called <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about 120. miles in length, and yet but narrow: here this people erected a Town, and called it <hi>South Hampton,</hi> there are many Indians on the greateſt part of this Iſland, who at firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling of the Engliſh there, did much annoy their Cattel with the multitude of Doggs they kept, which ordinarily are young wolves brought up came, continuing of a very ravening nature. This people gathered into a Church, and called to office Mr. <hi>Peirſon,</hi> who continued with them about 7, or 8. yeares, and then he, with the greateſt number of the people, removed farther into the Iſland; the other part that remained invited Mr. <hi>Foor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi> and a people that were with him, to come and joyne with them, who accordingly did, being wandered as far as the Dutch plantation, and there unſettled, although he came into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try before them.</p>
               <p>This yeare the Town and Church of Chriſt at <hi>Sudbury</hi> began to have the firſt foundation ſtones laid, taking up her ſtation in the Inland Country, as her elder Siſter Concord had formerly done, lying farther up the ſame River, being furniſhed with great plenty of freſh marſh, but it lying very low is much indamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with land-flouds, inſomuch that when the ſummer proves wet, they loſe part of their hay; yet are they ſo ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, that they take in Cattell of other Townes to winter: theſe people not neglecting the chief work, for the which they entred this wilderneſſe, namely, to worſhip the Lord in the purity of his Ordinances, and according to the rule of his Word, entred into covenant with him, and one with another profeſſedly to walk together in Church-fellowſhip; and according to the

               <p>Firſt to begin with the encreaſe of food, you have heard in what extream penury theſe people were in at firſt, planting for want of food, gold, ſilver, rayment, or whatſoever was precious in their eyes they parted with (when ſhips came in) for this their beaſt that died, ſome would ſtick before they were cold, and ſell their poor pined fleſh for food, at 6.d. <hi>per</hi> pound, Indian Beans at 16.s. <hi>per</hi> buſhel, when Ships came in it grieved ſome Maſter to ſee the urging of them by people of good rank and quality to ſell bread unto them.

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:119030:90"/>
and bread of his own growing, if not ſome cattel: beſide, fleſh is now no rare food, beef, pork, and mutton being frequent in many houſes, ſo that this poor Wilderneſs hath not onely equalized <hi>England</hi> in food, but goes beyond it in ſome places for the great plenty of wine and ſugar, which is ordinarily ſpent, apples, pears, and quince tarts inſtead of their former Pumpkin Pies, Poultry they have plenty, and great rarity, and in their feaſts have not forgotten the Engliſh faſhion of ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their appetites with variety of cooking their food; and notwithſtanding all this great and almoſt miraculous work of the Lord, in providing for his people in this barren deſart, yet are there here (as in other places) ſome that uſe theſe good creatures of God to exceſs, and others to hoard up in a wretched and miſerable manner, pinch themſelves and their children with food, and will not taſt of the good crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures God hath given for that end, but cut Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth as ſhort alſo: Let not ſuch think to eſcape the Lords hand with as little a ſtroke, as the like do in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>

and with more warmer affections exhort one another, Come let us go up unto the houſe of the Lord, and he will teach us his wayes: Alſo the Lord was pleaſed to awaken us with an Army of caterpillers, that had he not ſuddainly rebuked them, they had ſurely deſtroyed the husband mans hope, where they fell upon trees, they left them like winter-waſting cold, bare and naked; and although they fell on fields very rarely, yet in ſome places they made as clear a riddance, as the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt mans hand, and uncovered the gay green Medow ground, but indeed the Lord did by ſome plats ſhew us what he could have done with the whole, and in many places caſt them into the high wayes, that the Cart-wheels in their paſſage were painted green with running over the great ſwarms of them; in ſome fields they devoured the leaves of their peaſe, and left the ſtraw with the full crop, ſo tender was the Lord in his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; this minded all theſe Jacobites of the end of their coming over, but chiefly the husbandman, whoſe over eager purſuit of the fruits of the earth, made ſome of them many times run out ſo far in this Wilderneſs, even out of the ſweet ſound of the ſilver Trumpets blown by the laborious Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt, forſaking the aſſembly of the Lords people, to celebrate their Sabbaths in the chimney-corner, horſe, kine, ſheep, goats, and ſwine, being their moſt indeared compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to travel with them to the end of their pilgrimage, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe to gather together ſome of their neereſt neighbours, and make a preachment one unto another, till they had learn'd ſo much, that they could away with none other teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: As alſo the Lord was pleaſed to command the wind and Seas to give us a jog on the elbow, by ſinking the very chief of our ſhipping in the deep, and ſplitting them in ſhivers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſhores; a very goodly Ship called the Seaforce was eaſt away, and many N.

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:119030:111"/>
yet were theſe pilgrim people minded of the ſuddain forgetfulneſs of thoſe worthies that died not long before, but more eſpecially the little regard had to provide means to train their children up in the knowledg of learning, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove ſuch means as the Lord hath appointed to leave their poſterity an able Miniſter; as alſo to ſtir them up to prepare for the great work of the Lord Jeſus in the overthrow of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, and calling of the Jews, which in all likelyhood is very ſuddainly to be performed; as alſo in ſtirring up all the young ones that remain, to conſider for what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:119030:111"/>
ſame ſteps of riot and exceſs in the plenty he hath given them, with the men of this world, he will lay the ſame ſickneſſes and diſeaſes upon them; and further they perceive, according to the ordinary diſpenſation of his providences toward them, he hath ſome further great work to do with his N. E. people, that he is beginning again to a waken, rouze up, and quicken them with the rod of his power: For thus they begin to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with themſelves, when the Lord was pleaſed to expoſe them, their wifes, and little ones to the troubles of a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous Sea in ſo long a voyage, and the wants of a barren Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs in great penury of food, he brought forth by his mighty power, and ſtretched-our arm, the glorious fabrick of his New-E. Churches; and therefore now again they look for ſome further extraordinary great work of his, if he ſhall once again be pleaſed to refine them in this furnace of his, and would the Lord Chriſt would confirm our brethren in England in like faith by our example, yea, and far beyond many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, as the Wonder-working providence of Sions Saviour toward them hath more abundantly exceeded, and that as this in three ſeven years is compriſed, though very weakly in this little book, there's in one ſeven year would require vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, and as this is wonderful, there is almoſt miraculous, and wonderful to the whole world, as if the Lord Chriſt did intend to make his power known more abundantly, then ever the ſons of men ſaw Kings and Kingdoms ſtrengthened, with affinity and conſanguinity, the valiant of the world, men skil'd in feats of war, as <hi>Goliah</hi> from a child, fierce and pampered horſes, whoſe necks are covered with ſtrong neighing, and cunning Engeniers, men skilful to deſtroy with all the terrible engins of war, together with ſwarms of ſouldiers flocking together to ſwallow up the poor remnant of Gods people, all theſe hath the Lord cauſed to fall before your eyes, and our ears have heard the noyſe of this great fall; and beloved countrymen, and our dear brethren in Chriſt, ſtep into the cloſet of your own hearts with us, and ſee if there will not be ſome things in this following verſe that may ſuit your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as well as ours, that having ſown in tears, we may reap with joy the glorious harveſt of our Lord Chriſt, which is
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:119030:112"/>
hard at hand, for aſſuredly the Lord is tyed neither to us, nor you, but may, if it pleaſe him, caſt off both, and raiſe up new inſtruments for his following work, but if he be pleaſed to give us melting hearts for our former miſcarriages, and renew us with a more zealous courage and earneſt contending for the faith, it is very like he hath more glorious works by far for us yet to do.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THeſe brood of Travellers having thus through the good hand of their God upon them, thus ſetled theſe Churches, according to the inſtitution of Chriſt, and not by the will of man; they now endeavour to be aſſiſting to others: The reverend Mr. <hi>Hugh Peters,</hi> and his fellow-helper in Chriſt Mr. <hi>Wells</hi> ſteered their courſe for England, ſo ſoon as they heard of the chaining up of thoſe biting beaſts, who went under the name of ſpiritual Lords; what aſſiſtance the Goſpel of Chriſt found there by their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is ſince clearly manifeſted; for the Lord Chriſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving removed that uſurping power of Lordly Prelates, hath now inlarged his Kingdom there, and that not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the means of theſe men, but by divers others, both godly and eminent ſervants of his, who never ſaw New-England; and by divers other godly Miniſters of Chriſt, who have ſince gone from hence, both young Students and others, to the number of twenty, or thereabout, in the whole; beſides ſome who were eminent in the civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment here, both gracious and godly ſervants of Chriſt, and ſome who have been Magiſtrates here, to the number of five or ſix, the Lord Chriſt grant they may all endeavour the advancement of his truths, both in Churches and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Government: But before the Author ceaſe to ſpeak of England, he is bold to ſay, that the Lord Chriſt will overturn, overturn, overturn, till he hath cauſed ſuch a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to be ſet up, as ſhall become nurſing fathers to his new-planted Churches.</p>
               <p>The Indian people in theſe parts at the Engliſh firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, were very barbarous and uncivilized, going for the moſt part naked, although the country be extreme cold
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:119030:115"/>
cold in the winter-ſeaſon: they are onely clothed with a Deers skin, and a little bit of cloth to cover their privy part. The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for the moſt part are very modeſt, although they go as naked as the Men: they are generally very laborious at their planting time, and the Men extraordinary idle, making their ſquawes to carry their Children and the luggage beſide; ſo that many times they travell eight or ten mile with a burden on their backs, more fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a horſe to carry then a woman. The men follow no kind of labour but hunting, fiſhing and fowling, in all which they make uſe of their Bowe and Arrowes to ſhoot the wilde creatures of the Trees, as Squirrells, gray and black Rockoones: as for Deer, they ordinarily catch them in traps, with a pole bent down, and a Cord at the end, which flyes up and ſtayes their haſty courſe. <hi>Bever, Otter,</hi> and <hi>Mooſe</hi> they catch with Traps alſo: they are very good marks-men, with their Bowe and Arrows. Their Boyes will ordinarily ſhoot fiſh with their Arrowes as they ſwim in the ſhallow Rivers, they draw the Arrow halfe way putting the point of it into the water, they let flye and ſtrike the fiſh through; the like they do to Birds leſſer and great: onely the <hi>Geeſe</hi> and <hi>Turkies</hi> being ſtrong of wing, ſomtimes flee away with their Arrowes ſticking in them; this is all the trade they uſe, which makes them deſtitute of many receſſaries, both in meat, drink, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell and houſes.</p>
               <p>As for any religious obſervation, they were the moſt deſtitute of any people yet heard of, the Divel having them in very great ſubjection, not uſing craft to delude them, as he ordinarily doth in moſt parts of the World: but kept them in a continuall ſlaviſh fear of him: onely the <hi>Powawes,</hi> who are more converſant with him, then any other, ſometimes recover their ſicke folk with charmes, which they uſe, by the help of the Divell; and this makes them to adore ſuch; one of them was ſeen as is reported to cure a Squaw that was dangerouſly ſick, by taking a ſnakes skin and winding it about her arm the which ſoon became a living ſnake crawling round about her armes and body; another cauſed the ſick patient for healing, to paſs bare footed through many burning coals; thoſe that cannot cure them, they call Squantams powwons: but if the patient live, he is had in great admiration, and then they cry, Much winnit Abbamocho, that is, very good
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:119030:116"/>
Divell: for Squantam is a bad Divel, and Abbamocho is their good Divell. It hath been a thing very frequent, before the Engliſh came, for the Divell to appear unto them in a bodily ſhape, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very ugly and terrible, and ſometimes like a white boy, and chiefly in the moſt hideous woods and ſwamps: they report that ſometimes he hath come into their wigwams, and carryed away divers of them alive: and ſince we came hither, they tell us of a very terrible beaſt for ſhape and bigneſs, that came into a wigwam toward the North-eaſt parts, remote from any Engliſh plantations, and took away ſix men at a time, who were never ſeen afterward. The Engliſh at their firſt coming did aſſay and endeavour to bring them to the knowledge of God: and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular the reverend, grave, and godly Mr. <hi>John Wilſon,</hi> who viſited their ſick, and inſtructed others as they were capable to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him. But yet very little was done that way, till in proceſs of time they by continuall coming to the Engliſh, became bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to underſtand them; and now of late yeers the reverend Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi> hath been more then ordinary laborious to ſtudy their language, inſtructing them in their own Wigwams, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſing their Children. As alſo the reverend Mr. <hi>Mayhewe,</hi> one who was tutored up in <hi>N. Eng.</hi> and called to office by the Church of Chriſt, gathered at a ſmall Iſland called <hi>Martins Vineyard:</hi> this man hath taken good pains with them: but the particulars of our godly Miniſters labours, together with the good hand of our God upon their indeavours, being already publiſhed, no further need be ſpoken. <note place="margin">

               <p>ABout the yeer the Lord was pleaſed to put it into the heare of ſome godly people in <hi>Virginia,</hi> to ſend to <hi>N.

The godly Mr. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip Bennit</hi> coming hither, made our reverend Elders acquainted with their deſires, who were very ſtudious to take all opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities for inlarging the kingdome of Chriſt: and upon ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, the reverend Mr. <hi>Knowls</hi> of <hi>Watertowne,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tompſon</hi> of <hi>Braintree</hi> were ſent unto them, who ariving there in ſafety, preached openly unto the people for ſome good ſpace of time, and alſo from houſe to houſe exhorted the people dayly, that with full purpoſe of heart they would cleave unto the Lord; the harveſt they had was plentifull for the little ſpace of time they were there, till being oppoſed by the Governour and ſome other malignant ſpirits, they were forced to returne to <hi>N.

It were much to be deſired, that all people would take notice of the hand of God againſt this people, after the rejection of theſe Miniſters of Chriſt: and indeed it was none other but the thruſting Chriſt from them; and now attend to the following ſtory, all you Cavaliers and malignant party the world through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, take notice of the wonderworking providence of Chriſt toward his Churches, and puniſhing hand of his toward the contemners of his Goſpel.

up the River: the manner of the Engliſh Plantations there being very ſcattering quite contrary to <hi>N. E.</hi> people, who for the moſt part deſire ſociety. The manner of the <hi>Indians</hi> proceeding was thus, they divided themſelves into ſeverall companies, and beſet the Engliſh houſes a little before break of day, waiting for the firſt perſon that ſhould open the doore and come forth, whom they cruelly murdered, beating out their brains, and then forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with entred the houſe and ſlew all they found within, ſometimes fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the houſes, and leaving the living children miſerably to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed with their dead Parents in the fearfull flames; ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fleeing from this barbarous maſſacre, as they paſſed by a fired houſe heard a pitifull out-cry of a poor Child, crying, I burn, I burn: although they could willingly have made haſte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, yet the miſerable out-cry of this poor babe, cauſed them to haft to the houſe, and reſcue it forth the flames, that was even al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ready to ſcorch it: this cruell and bloody work of theirs put period to the lives of five or ſix hundred of theſe people, who had not long before a plentifull proffer of the mercies of Chriſt in the glad tidings of peace publiſhed by the mouth of his Miniſters, who came unto them for that end: but chuſing rather the fellowſhip of their drunken companions, and a Preiſt of their own profeſſion, who could hardly continue ſo long ſober as till he could read them the reliques of mans invention in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer book; but aſſuredly had not the Lord pittied the little number of his people among this crooked generation, they had been conſumed at once for this is further remarkable in this maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre, when it came toward the place where Chriſt had placed his little flock, it was diſcovered &amp; prevented from further proceeding, and the Lord by this means did ſo allay their ſpirits of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity toward his people, they gathered in a Church in preſence of the very governour himſelf, and called to office one Mr. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,</hi> who could not long continue among them, by reaſon of their freſh renewed malignity, who had formerly an evill eye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, and could no better refraine from oppreſſing them, then <hi>Pharoah</hi> after he had reſt from the plagues under which he was. After the departure of Mr. <hi>Harriſon,</hi> one Mr. <hi>Duren</hi> became an help unto them; but he and his people alſo were forced to remove many hundred miles up into the country, where they

now remain; but aſſuredly the Lord hath more ſcourges in ſtore, for ſuch as force the people to ſuch ſufferings: and therefore let this Church of Chriſt continue in the way of his truth according to the rules of his Goſpel, and without doubt the Lord will preſerve and continue them, let the adverſaries of his Truth be never ſo potent. As alſo about this time, the Lord was pleaſed to gather a people together in the Iſle of <hi>Bermoodas,</hi> whoſe hearts being guided by the rule of the word, they gathered into a Church of Chriſt according to the rules of the Goſpel, being <note place="margin">

of his invincible Army to the battell: ſome ſuppoſe this onely to be myſticall, and not literall at all: aſſuredly the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall fight is chiefly to be attended, and the other not neglected, having a neer dependancy one upon the other, eſpecially at this time; the Miniſters of Chriſt who have caſt off all lording power over one another, are created field-Officers, whoſe Office is <note n="*" place="margin">Yea every Officer hath his own proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment.</note> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant in this Army, chiefly to encourage the fighting Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and to lead them on upon the enemy in the moſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious places, and bring on freſh ſupplies in all places of danger, to put the ſword of the ſpirit in their Souldiers hands: but Chriſt (who is their general) muſt onely enable them to uſe it aright: to give every Souldier in charge that they watch over one another, to ſee that none meddle with the execrable things of Antichriſt, and this to be performed in every Regiment throughout the Army: and not one to exerciſe dominion over the other by way of ſuperiority: for Chriſt hath appointed a parity in all his Regiments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> let them beware that none go apart with rebellious <hi>Korah.</hi> And further, behold, Kings, Rulers, or Generals of Earths Armies, doth Chriſt make uſe of in this day of battell, the which he hath brought into the field already alſo; who are appointed to defend, uphold, and maintain the whole body of his Armies againſt the inſolent, beaſtly, and bloody cruelty of their inſatiable enemies, and to keep order that none do his fellow-Souldier any wrong, nor that any ſhould raiſe a mutiny in the hoſts. Notwithſtanding all this, if any ſhall ſay, they will not believe the day is come till they ſee them ingage battell with Antichriſt; Verily, if the Lord be pleaſed to open your eyes, you may ſee the beginning of the fight, and what ſucceſs the Armies of our Lord Chriſt have hitherto had: the Forlorne hopes of Antichriſts Army, were the proud Prelates of <hi>England:</hi> the Forlorne of Chriſts Armies, were theſe <hi>N. E.</hi> people who are the ſubject of this Hiſtory, which encountring each other for ſome ſpace of time, ours being overpowered with multitude, were forced to retreat to a place of greater ſafety, where they waited for a freſh opportunity to ingage with the main battell of Antichriſt, ſo ſoon as the Lord ſhall be pleaſed to give a word of Command. Immediately upon this ſucceſs, the Lord Chriſt was pleaſed to command the right Wing of his Army, to advance againſt the left Wing of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt:
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:119030:119"/>
where in his former forlorn hopes of proud Prelates lay: theſe by our right Wing had their firſt pay (for that they had done to our forlorne before) being quite overthrown and cut in peices by the valiant of the Lord in our right Wing, who ſtill remain fighting. Thus far of the battell of Antichriſt, and the various ſucceſs; what the iſſue will be, is aſſuredly known in the generall already. <hi>Babylon</hi> is fallen, the God of truth hath ſaid it; then who would not be a Souldier on Chriſts ſide, where is ſuch a certainty of victory? nay I can tell you a farther word of encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, every true-hearted Souldier that falls by the ſword in this fight, ſhall not lye dead long, but ſtand upon his feet again, and be made partaker of the triumph of this Victory: and none can be overcome, but by turning his back in fight. And for a word of terrour to the enemy, let them know, Chriſt will never give over the raiſing of freſh Forces, till they are overthrown root and branch. And now you antient people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> look out of your Priſon grates, let theſe Armies of the Lord Chriſt Jeſus provoke you to acknowledge he is certainly come, I and ſpeedily he doth come to put life into your dry bones: here is a people not onely praying but fighting for you, that the great block may be removed out of the way, (which hath hindered hitherto) that they with you may enjoy that glorious reſurrection-day, the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nuptials of the Lamb: when not only the Bridegroom ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to his Churches both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> (which are his ſpouſe) in a more brighter aray then ever heretofore, but alſo his Bride ſhall be clothed by him in the richeſt garments that ever the Sons of men put on, even the glorious graces of Chriſt Jeſus, in ſuch a glorious ſplendor to the eyes of man, that they ſhall ſee and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the Father of both Bridegroom and Bride.</p>
