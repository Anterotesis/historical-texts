            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

harmeleſſe and ill-leſſe foul-works, being from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               </gap>; for who (ſay they) is infallible: <hi>and who hath
known the minde of the Lord?</hi> ſo as the truth muſt be
monopolized to any one Sect, or way? who in faith

and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and ſuch <hi>as bring another doctrine,</hi> as
thoſe whom you ſo labour to convince and rebuke?</p>
            <p>3. Conſcience is hereby made every mans Rule,
Umpire, Judge, Bible, and his <hi>God,</hi> which if he follow,
he is but at the worſt, a godly, pious, holy Hereticke,
who feareth his conſcience more then his <hi>Creator,</hi> and
is to be judged of you a Saint.</p>
            <p>4. Hence conſcience being deified, all rebuking, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting,
counter-arguing, yea all the Miniſtery of the
Goſpel muſt be laid aſide; no man muſt judge brother
Idolater, or brother Familſt, or Saints to be <hi>Socinians,</hi>

who can make a window in any mans ſoule, and ſee
there heart-obſtinacy which only doth eſſentially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
the heretick, the blaſphemer, the falſe Prophet?</p>
            <p>But is not brotherly forbearance, Chriſtian indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
a debt we owe to brethren, Saints, and the
truly godly in errours, and mind-infirmities, which by
a naturall emanation or reſultance get the fore-ſtart of
freewill?</p>
            <p>To which I ſhall ſpeak in theſe few conſiderations.</p>
            <p>1. It is much to be deſired with the prayers and
ſuits of the children of <hi>God,</hi> that where there are two
opinions, there may be one heart, that the Father of
Spirits would unite the hearts of all the children of one
Father, and the heirs of one houſe.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Papiſts</hi> here have exceeded in boundleſſe domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and tyranny over the conſciences of men: and
what ever is contrary to the lawleſſe decrees of their
<hi>Councells</hi> and <hi>Popes,</hi> is an unexpiable hereſie, and cannot
be purged but by fire and fagot. 2. Who ever refuſe
ſubjection of conſcience to that Enemy of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and
to that woman-miſtreſſe of witchcrafts, on <hi>whoſe skirts
is found the blood of the martyrs of Jeſus,</hi> is preſently an
heretick, and his arguments anſwered with burning-quicke,
this tyranny over conſcience we diſclaime;
yet for that ought, not the other extremity of wilde
toleration to be imbraced.</p>
            <p>3. We cannot thinke but all Saints in this ſide of
glory carry to heaven with them errours, miſtakes,
and <hi>propheſying in part,</hi> and the faireſt Stars and lights
in this lower firmament of the Church are clouded,
and the benefit of the Moon ſerves to enlighten the
under garden of Lillies, <hi>where Chriſt feedeth, till the day
<pb facs="tcp:115605:4"/>
breake, and the ſhadows flee away.</hi> And here brotherly
indulgence and reciporation of the debt of compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
forbearance of the infirmities one of another
muſt have place.</p>
            <p>4. Yet ſo, as there can be no conflict of grace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
grace; nor can the taking off the Foxes which
deſtroy the Vines, be contrary to the gentleneſſe and
meekneſſe of Saints in fulfilling the law of love, and
bearing one anothers burdens, nor can love ſeated eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
in a new borne childe of the ſecond birth be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

2. Its object. 3. Its office. 4. The kinds of Conſcience;
And 5. the adjuncts of it, the libertie of Conſcience, and

them, as the damned take to hell a peace of hell within them, an

can bring it forthe; a worme at the heart can bear witneſſe, if

cannot ſpeake, nor act upon the ſoule.</p>
            <p>2. The nature of Conſcience is further cleared by its office,

            <p>That we may the more diſtinctly ſpeake of theſe, it would be

            <p>Conſcience is not the ſimple judgement and apprehenſion of

but it is the power to know things our ſelfe, and actions,
in order to obey God and ſerve him. 2. But the queſtion is,
whether Conſcience bee a ſimple practicall apprehenſion of
things, or a compounded and diſcourſive apprehenſion. To which
I anſwere. 1. That as the ſpeculative underſtanding know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

ſixtie and ſeven times more then the Earth, yet it referreth both

<hi>God</hi> to be infinite, <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be the alone choiſeſt of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours;
So it is conſummate and perfected in a diſcourſe or ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme

2. And when any in ill blood, deny ſuch truths, as that there

And looke how much goodneſſe and true feare of God
is in a Man, as much feare of himſelfe and reverence to his own
conſcience is within him. For 1. to be holden even with
the charges and writs of an erring conſcience is obedience to
the Law of nature, as we would not be willing that a ſcout, or
a ſpie ſent from a ſtrange Land ſhould ſee our nakedneſſe, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
folly, ſecuritie. When the Conſcience returneth, to the
Father of Spirits, it can tell tales of men, and can libell many
pollutions of the fleſh and ſpirit acted by the man, while the
Conſcience lodged with clay and a polluted Spirit. 2. Becauſe
Conſcience is ſomething of God, a domeſtick little God, a
keeper ſent from heaven, a divine peece which is all eye, all
ſenſe, and hath the word with it, in ſo farre it is to be reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and hath the reverenceth the King, reverenceth the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador,
in ſo farre as he carrieth along the Kings will, he that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth
the Lord muſt honour the ſervant. 3. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith,
<hi>Prov. 15. 5. A foole deſpiſeth his fathers reproofe, but he that
regardeth it is prudent.</hi> Verſ. 10. <hi>He that hateth reproofe ſhall
die.</hi> To receive Inſtructions and rebukes from Conſcience, in
ſo farre as they come from the Word of truth is ſpirituall
prudence, and he that turneth away his eare from his conſcience,
ſhall die. 4. As to ſubmit to the Word, is to ſubmit to God,
ſo to offer violence to a divine truth, is to wreſtle with God,
and by the like proportion to ſtoope before Conſcience carrying
a meſſage from God, is to ſubmit to God, and to doe violence
to the domeſticke light and truth of God, is all one as to wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
with God. 5. We count a tender Conſcience, ſuch as
was in <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> who did yeeld and cede to the Law of God,
and its threatnings, a ſoft heart; then to ſtand out as a flint-ſtone
or an Adamant, againſt the warnings of an inward Law muſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
hardneſſe of heart. 6. There is nothing ſo ſtrong and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
as truth, a Conſcience that will bargaine to buy and ſell
truth, and will be the Lord and Conquerour, not the captive
and taken priſoner of the Goſpel, bearing it ſelfe on upon the

ſo it is Miniſterially onely and by way of office in the Elders, as

And this is more then a priviledge of order and honor, which

Supreme and abſolute over the Conſcience, this is in

Royall and Princely; Yet is it more (I ſay not more excellent, it
not being ſaving of it ſelfe as in beleevers) than a priviledge of
meere honour and order, for though it lay no more bands on the
Conſcience to obtain faith becauſe it is holden forth by men, it
having no influence on the Conſcience becauſe of men, whoſe

may miniſterially and officially command obedience to their
judgement as far as it agrees with the mind of Chriſt, no farther:
and when it is diſobeyed may inflict cenſures, which private
Chriſtians cannot doe, and putteth theſe who diſobey under
another guiltineſſe, then if private Chriſtians did ſpeake the ſame
word, to wit not onely in a caſe of diſobedience to the ſecond

it is not ſufficient that they be put to ſubſcribe a confeſſion of

ſweare and ſeale the old Teſtament in their own ſenſe, but their

intrinſecally infallible, and can never become fallible, though
fallible and ſinfull men that are obnoxious to errour and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes
doe hold it forth Miniſterially to others: and it is falſe
that we are to believe that what Synods determine according to
the word of God, we are to believe it is fallible and lyable to
errour, and may an untruth, becauſe they ſo determine, for
then when a Synod determines, <hi>there is but one true God,</hi> the
principle of faith is believed to be ſubject to Retraction and
falſhood, becauſe a Synod hath determined it to be a truth. But
the truth is we are to believe truths determined by Synods to
be infallible, and never againe lyable to retractation or diſcuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
becauſe they are and were in themſelves and without any

becauſe, <hi>ſo ſaith the Synod,</hi> but becauſe ſo ſaith the Lord,
It is true, new hereticks pretending new light may ariſe as

determined that are cleared in former Synods, but it follows
not but theſe truths are ſtill in themſelves fixed and unmovable
as the Pole-ſtar, though evil men bring them under a new Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall

            <p>But I anſwer this concludes not onely againſt a Synodicall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination,

the myſterie is, though a Synod ſhould determine a truth an

it is no truth, the determination of a Synod doth not obliedge at

the impoſition is not needleſſe, but the commanding power in

many, as a Synod, <hi>is not needleſſe</hi> but uſefull and fruitfull, and

needleſſe? when it bringeth forth fruit. Suppoſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſay to

If this impoſing had wrought faith in <hi>Elimas,</hi> as by the
grace of God it might, had this impoſing been needleſſe the
man might as well ſay: becauſe this tree brings forth fruit being
digged and branched, and pruned, therefore digging was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe.
But he ſuppoſeth vainly that impoſing and commands iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
from Synods under penalties and cenſures are contrary to
trying all things, becauſe impoſing concludes men under cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
though they trie the decrees of Synods to be unjuſt, but
the impoſing of Synods is conditionall, not abſolute as <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi>
ſuppoſe, for after Synods impoſe, if beleevers after trying
and due examining, ſhall finde that truely and really the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees

neither is a juſt <hi>Impoſing,</hi> not any <hi>impoſing</hi> at all. For neither

and if people ſhall finde their decrees truly to be ſo after tryall
they have power to reject them. And 3. the laſt part of the

were a commanding that wee receive abſolutely what
they ſay, be it good, or ill, without examining the argument

               <hi>Miniſters</hi> are not armed with force and it is not fit they ſhould
<hi>ſaevire per alios</hi> ſtirre up the Magiſtrate againſt others, the
Magiſtrate is the Miniſter of God properly for wrath. But it
is fit for Miniſters to ſay as Chriſt, I came not to deſtroy but to
ſave alive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Authour ſaith the queſtion is not of tranſmitting
<hi>of ſuch things to the Magiſtrate as belong to manners, but to
conſcience,</hi> as if an heretick failed againſt no manners. Yet all
his Arguments prove that Miniſters ſhould not complaine to the
Magiſtrate of ill manners and the ſcandalous converſation of
any, and this he inſtanceth from the example of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who
<hi>Joh.</hi> 8. would not accuſe a woman of adulterie. 2. The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
is as properly the Miniſter of God for good, for the praiſe
of well-doing, as the Miniſter of God for wrath, and if the

doe to all under their care <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 16, 17, 18, 19. Magiſtrate
or other, if the Magiſtrate ſpare the life of a murtherer, the
watchmen are unfaithfull, if they complaine not openly and tell
the Magiſtrate he does not his dutie, and upon the ſame ground,
if the Magiſtrate muſt coerce with the ſword ſeducing wolves
and <hi>Jezabels,</hi> the Paſtours ought to admoniſh him. And its
Atheiſticall to ſay the <hi>Magiſtrate is conſcious of ſins againſt
manners, and of his dutie and obligation he needs no inſtigation.</hi>
Becauſe no Magiſtrate be he an <hi>Achab</hi> or a <hi>David,</hi> but he needs
be quickened to his dutie, and will ſend a murtherer away, and a
bloody <hi>Joab</hi> whom God will have not to live, and ſhould the

is this obtruding into another office to give warning to all to be
free of the blood of all men? this is like the ſpeech of a wicked
King <hi>Amaziah</hi> 2 Chro. 25. 16. To the Prophet who rebuked
him, for ſeeking after the Gods of the Nations. <hi>Art thou made

to him that calls good evill, and evill good. Is the neceſſary duty
of the calling of a watchman to warne the Magiſtrate of his
bloodie omiſſions, (for ſo the Lord calls it <hi>Eſay. 1. 21, 22. Eſay</hi>

            <p>He cites alſo the example (p. 76. 77.) of Chriſt who would
not accuſe the woman taken in adulterie. What doth this prove?
<hi>Ergo</hi> Chriſt would not have faithfull paſtors to complaine both
to <hi>God,</hi> and to preach againſt Rulers who puniſh not uncorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
adulterers? <hi>Chriſt</hi> would not accuſe her, he would not
judge her. <hi>Ergo</hi> the Judges under the new Teſtament who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,
judge and condemn adulterers, are not followers of Chriſt?
What can an <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> alleadge more to prove there ought to
be no Magiſtrates under the new Teſtament? Adulterers muſt
be tollerated: A Miniſter ſhould not preach that the Magiſtrate
ſins in not puniſhing the Adulterer. Chriſt complained not of
<hi>Pilates</hi> mixing the <hi>Galileans</hi> blood with their ſacrifice to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi>
ſhould therefore Miniſters not complaine though the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<hi>Magiſtrate</hi> ſuffer ſuch blood-ſhed?</p>
            <p>Of the ſame kinde is that wrangling, <hi>prudent fathers encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
not their children to informe of one anothers faults, becauſe
it doth not nouriſh love.</hi> What then? <hi>Ergo</hi> Miniſters ſhould
complaine to the Godly Magiſtrate of no omiſſions at all? I
think by this Divinitie, if one brother know his brother to kill
his brother, he ſhould neither informe father nor Magiſtrate
that the murtherer may be rebuked by the father or corrected
by the Judge, becauſe that may hinder love, but let this wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
anſwer, whither it be more reall love to the murtherers ſoul
to informe againſt him, and more glory to God, more peace to
the familie; or to be ſilent and let his brother run to hell, and
wrath lye upon the whole land? It is but a loſſe of time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115605:38"/>
ſuch weak foolerie againſt naturall reaſon, far more contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to ſound Divinitie, for if paſtors informe againſt evil doers
out of deſire of revenge, malice or hatred, they ought not upon
theſe grounds to rebuke any ſins at all, and we condemn the
doing of good duties upon evill motives and principles.</p>

that the Godly Prince ſhould ſuffer them: nor can it be ſaid
that Church-cenſures are ſpirituall puniſhments and ſo work on
the ſpirit, and have inſtructing, rebuking and exhorting going
before, but the ſword is a bodily puniſhment, and hath not
inſtructing going before. For I anſwer though theſe two
puniſhments differ, yet they agree that formally both are alike
compulſory of the conſcience, and neither of them act upon the
ſpirit by teaching and inſtructing as the word doth, ſo as excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of a heretick ſhould have inſtructing and convincing
going before, ſo ſhould alſo the <hi>Magistrate</hi> preſuppoſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſtrike with the ſword, that the falſe teacher hath been
inſtructed and convinced, and ſo he doth formally puniſh him
with the ſword, for his pertinacious perverting of ſouls.</p>
            <p>3. Nor can it be replyed that men ſhould not be puniſhed for
either opinions, or for holding opinions that ſlow from meer
conſcience, when they publiſh preach and print them from
no principle, but meer conſcience, not for gain or a morſell of
bread, or for preferment in the ſtate or Armie. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115605:39"/>
lay aſide opinions and anſwer me this, how the Judges
that are for libertie of conſcience are not to puniſh ſome words
except they would be guilty of perſecution, to wit, ſuch as
theſe, <hi>the Trinitie is but a fiction, Chriſt is no more God then
another holy man.</hi> Yea, <hi>Chriſt was but an Impoſtor,</hi> and yet
they puniſh words and deeds of the ſame kinde that come from
meere conſcience. The anſwer muſt be, the former words
are from meere conſcience and the publiſhers thereof will ſwear
they hold them as the meere inforcing light and judgement of
their conſcience; But theſe other words and deeds which the
<hi>Magiſtrate</hi> cenſures, are not from meere conſcience. But I
beleeve theſe that acted in the late <hi>controverted Parliament</hi>
and by vertue thereof, yea and many Godly men of them
that are puniſhed by the Judges and many of the Godly that
fled for fear act from meere conſcience, and will ſweare they
did ſo act according to their ſworn covenant, and to prevent
a new warre: and that they did it neither for gain, nor for
preferment in State or Armie. And if it were referred to the
conſciences of moſt of the Armie why they disbanded not when
the <hi>Parliament</hi> commanded them, but doe by their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
treat a warre to themſelves and the land (a judgement
of God of all others the ſaddeſt) when they have none to fight

ſome externall actions of words and deeds comming from
meere conſcience without any carnall pretext, as they will

without any carnall pretext, as they will ſweare, are puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and yet neither violence is done to conſcience nor the men

or negative doth fight againſt all. If it be lawfull for the
<hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> as for all other men, to doe all hee can for the
truth as ſome ſay, and the <hi>Magiſtrates invitations, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
exemplarie profeſſion, generall tuition,</hi> excluding
coercing, are all nothing but words, theſe agree to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
as Chriſtians and are nothing peculiar to the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi>
the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> as a <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> cannot requeſt, he muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
as a <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> and all his commands if diſobeyed, are
in order to the ſword.</p>
            <p>5. The queſtion is not whether Religion can be inforced
upon men by the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> by the dint and violence of the
ſword, or onely perſwaded by the power of the word, Wee
hold with <hi>Lactantius</hi> that Religion cannot be compelled, nor
can mercie and juſtice and love to our neighbour command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the ſecond table be more compelled then faith in <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
Hence give me leave to prove two things. 1. <hi>That Religion and
faith cannot be forced on men.</hi> 2. That this is a vain conſequence;
<hi>Religion cannot be forced but muſt be perſwaded by the word
and Spirit,</hi> Ergo <hi>the Magiſtrate can uſe no coercive power
in puniſhing Hereticks and falſe teachers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt, we lay hold on all the arguments that prove

2. There is no ground in Scripture to ſay that becauſe the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites</hi>
erred againſt the duties of the firſt table onely, that
therefore iſrael was to deſtroy them in warre. For <hi>Joſhua</hi> 11.
26, 27, 28. the contrarie is clear, <hi>Joſhua made warre with
them, becauſe God having hardened their heart they came out
in battle againſt Iſrael:</hi> and ſo the cauſe of the warre was
not Religion and their madneſſe of Idolatrie (though on the
Lords part it was a provoking cauſe) but violence in invading
an harmeleſſe and innocent people, ſo <hi>Ioſhua</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
them not to embrace the true Religion, then from
thence it cannot follow therefore no lawes were to be made
againſt the falſe Prophets and blaſphemer. And if that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
was null then, it cannot be ſtrong now. So we ſay
under the new Teſtament: we cannot bring in to the faith the
Heathen and Pagans by violence and the ſword, it follows
not <hi>Ergo,</hi> no blaſphemer within the viſible Church ſhould be
forced. 3. violence and the ſword is no means to work men

and therefore he ſhould not deliver any to Sathan. 4. nor is this
a good conſequence, becauſe the fear of bodily death or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment

terrifie men from externall blaſphemie and tempting of others
to falſe worſhip, for the externall man his words, ſolicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

the <hi>Pelagian, Arminian</hi> and <hi>Popiſh</hi> objection againſt <hi>God</hi>

is puniſhed for his externall acts of falſe teaching and ſeducing
which may, and muſt be proved by witneſſe or confeſſed by
the delinquent, before he can juſtly puniſh him, but not for
any mind-error which is obvious neither to judge nor witneſſe.</p>

this point (<hi>who ever will now be circumciſed is fallen from
Chriſt</hi>) were eternally damned, and dyed out of Chriſt is a
groundleſſe ſaying: there was a glorious Church in <hi>Galatia</hi>
before <hi>Paul</hi> wrote that epiſtle to them, for he wrote it upon
occaſion of their being ſeduced, who were made believe the
neceſſitie of circumciſion, and it is clear <hi>Paul</hi> would not have
written that of circumciſion, if that errour had not been
ſowen among them by falſe teachers, if therefore ſuch as
were made beleive that had not beene bewitched to believe
the neceſſitie of Ceremonies for juſtification, they being in
Chriſt, ſhould have been ſaved by faith, though this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie
<hi>in terminis</hi> had never come to their ears: <hi>whither are
believers juſtified by faith onely, or muſt they alſo be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
and keep the Law?</hi> that they may be juſtified and ſaved.
And ſure many are now in our dayes (which is more) glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
who never knew, but onely virtually, and implicitely,
that to be circumciſed, or to keep Jewiſh dayes is not neceſſary
to juſtified perſons, yea ſure many in Britaine are ſaved who
never knew this fundamentall truth. 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 15. it is cleare
<hi>that ſome taught the brethren, except ye be circumciſed after
the manner of Moſes,</hi> ye cannot be ſaved: the contrary
truth is no expreſſe fundamentall truth, becauſe a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
truth expreſſely neceſſary is ſo neceſſary (<hi>neceſſitate medij</hi>)
as without the knowledge thereof we cannot be ſaved. Now
theſe teachers knew that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> and Saints at
at Jeruſalem were not circumciſed ſo, and they knew belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Gentiles were not circumciſed at all, and yet they knew
the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were not damned, they knew all children dying
before the eight day were not damned, they muſt then hold
that Circumciſion was onely neceſſary to ſalvation, by way of
precept: and the brethren that believed and ſo if they had
dyed in that ſtate had undeniably been ſaved, were ignorant of
this; and v. 7. <hi>there was much diſputing among believers</hi> yea
among the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> who were not ignorant of fundamentals:
and undoubtedly had ſaving faith long before, <hi>Math.</hi> 16. 17.

ſide, <hi>Joan. Bergius, Joan. Crotius, Theophilus Nenbergius,</hi> who

            <p>At the agreement or concord of <hi>Marpurge, an.</hi> 1529. were
<hi>Luther, Melanthon, Oſiander, Brentius, Stephanus Agricola,</hi> who

               </gap>o vere fiat, <hi>and that truely or
really there is a receiving thereof, we agree as brethren;</hi> but the
truth is, there were contrary faiths touching the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of Chriſts body and blood in the Sacrament; and
therefore I humbly conceive all ſuch Generall confeſſions as
muſt be a coat to cover two contrary faiths, is but a daubing
of the matter with untempered mortar; much dealing like
this was in the Councell of Trent, in which neither <hi>Papiſt</hi>
nor <hi>Proteſtant</hi> was condemned, and yet the truth ſuffered; I
ſpeake not this as if each ſide could exactly know every
lith and veine of the controverſie, <hi>for we propheſie but in part,</hi>
but to ſhew I cannot but abominate truth and falſehood,
patched up in one confeſſion of faith; for if two men ſhould
agree in ſuch a bargaine, <hi>A</hi> covenants with <hi>B</hi> to give him
a ſhip full of ſpices; <hi>B</hi> promiſes to give an hundreth thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
pounds for theſe ſpices, <hi>A</hi> believes they are metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall
ſpices he gives, <hi>B</hi> believes they are the moſt reall and
excellent ſpices of Aegypt; <hi>B</hi> promiſes a hundreth thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
pounds of field ſtones, <hi>A</hi> expects good, reall, and true
money; this were but mutuall jugling of one with another.
It were another conſideration, if both ſides agreeing in this
Generall confeſſion were ignorant, and did neither know
nor believe any ſenſe that were deſtructive to the true and
ſound ſenſe of the Confeſſion, for then they might be ſaved
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115605:55"/>
by, or in one and the ſame faith of this General Confeſſion,
whereas now the contrary ſenſes of this Confeſſion make
them now not one Generall, but two particular <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>,
and contradictory faiths; for the queſtion is, whether the
ſide believing the Generall Confeſſion with a ſenſe in the
conſequence, that deſtroyes the text, have any faith at all of
this Generall Confeſſion. For it is a queſtion to me whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Turke hath the faith of this point, <hi>that there is a God,</hi>
ſince he believes poſitively ſo many blaſphemous fooleries
of this <hi>God,</hi> as the <hi>Alcharon</hi> ſuggeſteth, and whether a <hi>Papiſt</hi> as
a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> believes <hi>Chriſt to be the onely one Saviour of ſinners,</hi> ſince
withall he believes ſo many thouſand Gods and true Chriſts
to be at once in ſundry places, and ſo many blaſphemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the nature, offices, and eſſentiall properties of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
as the Romiſh faith teacheth.</p>
            <p>But ye will ſay, it is not charity to ſay that Papiſts have
not the faith of the one onely Saviour, ſeeing he would dye

ſay) and in the moſt part (as others ſay) yea it muſt not be
our ſinfull darkeneſſe in that wee cannot beleeve moſt of
the matters of <hi>God,</hi> but with a reſerve, but it is the will and
command of God we doe ſo: and how ſhall we know the
ſecond faith contradictory to the former to be the minde of
God; and not the firſt, and the third, and not the ſecond,
and the fourth; and not the third, and ſo to the end? ſince
we are to beleeve all the foure with a reſerve, and all to our
dying day with a reſerve for the word is alike dubious now
as in <hi>Pauls</hi> dayes: and ſince the Apoſtles charge us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve

beleeved, not as <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> but as Chriſtians, and as fellow-Citizens
with us, we muſt ſay that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> alſo beleeved

the rule of your faith, and practiſe, for if the holy ghoſt
command you to beleeve ſuch points, with the faith of a
reſerve, he muſt command you to practiſe, according to
the preſent faith that he commands you to have of thoſe
truths. But the preſent you have, may be the beleife of a
lye and a blaſphemous untruth, and ſo the ten Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
ſhould bee a rule to no man. But his erroneous
conſcience, if then he beleeve that it is ſuch acceptable wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
as God craved of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that you ſacrifice your

what you are oblieged to beleeve: but you are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieged
to beleeve with a reſerve, that it is acceptable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to God to ſacrifice your child to him; for it is a non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundamentall
not clearly determined in the word, as leaſt it
is contraverted by many that goe for godly people. Now
if ſo, <hi>God</hi> ſhall obliege men to ſin and not to ſin; to doe
his revealed wil, and not to doe his revealed will, in the
ſame commandement, which were blaſphemous, now that
we are to practiſe according to our faith of reſerve. I prove
by the doctrin of <hi>Libertines,</hi> for they teach a man is to ſuffer
death, and any torment, rather then that he ſay, <hi>there bee
three perſons in one God, and two natures and one perſon in Chriſt,</hi>
and <hi>that Presbyterian Government is lawfull,</hi> that the <hi>Chriſtian
Prince is to puniſh falſe teachers</hi> if he beleeve in his conſcience,
though hee is to beleeve with a reſerve and doubt ſomely,
that theſe are truths contrary to the word of God, then is
his faith with a reſerve, which may be the faith of a lye,
his onely oblieging rule of his practiſe, according to the
way of <hi>Libertines.</hi> I confeſſe hee is rather to ſuffer death
then to profeſſe any doctrine contrary to the dictates even
of an erroneous conſcience, becauſe he ſhould chooſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
rather then ſin. But when we are commanded
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115605:62"/>
faith with a reſerve, as they ſay, we are commanded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
a lye (which is blaſphemous) and what we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to beleeve by the Lord in his word, that muſt be an
oblieging rule to our practice, and ſo muſt we be oblieged
to ſin; nor can it be ſaid to <hi>offer your child to God in a ſacrifice,</hi> is
againſt the light, and a cleare Law of nature, and a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
errour; for in this diſpute <hi>Libertines</hi> arguments are

two wayes: <hi>Atheiſts</hi> ſo farre winke, though nature cannot,

1. The principles of nature <hi>that God is,</hi> that
he is infinit, omnipotent, juſt, mercifull, omniſcient, &amp;c.
to be loved, ſerved, obeyed, &amp;c. that ſuperiours and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
are to be honoured, our neighbour not to bee hurt,
that wee ſhould doe to others as we would they ſhould doe
to us, are not of themſelves controverſall; but the practicall
concluſions drawne from thence are controverſall in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of our darkeneſſe, as polygamy, community of goods,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115605:63"/>
all theſe, whether the Saints may rob and ſpoyle wicked
men of their poſſeſſions, and kill them upon the right, and
authority of Saintſhip, are of themſelves controverſall in
relation to our nature who acknowledge Scripture to bee
the word of <hi>God;</hi> but for ſupernaturall truths that cannot
finde lodging in the ſphere, or under the ſhadow of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
reaſon, ſuch as the doctrine <hi>of one God in three perſons of
the incarnation of two natures in Chriſt, of the imputed righteouſneſſe
of Chriſt, of ſalvation by beleeving in a crucified Saviour, the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the dead;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Fundamentalls of faith moſt controverſall to our blinde nature.</note> and thoſe that are not knowable but by
ſupernaturall revelation, though they be the fundamentalls
of the Chriſtian faith, yet are they more controverſall of
themſelves then the moſt part of non-fundamentalls, as <hi>Joh. Goodwin</hi>
does rightly obſerve, for nature hath more ſhadow

truths; if then no coercive power ought to be uſed againſt
ſuch as teach errours contrary to the word of <hi>God,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

there is farre more warrant to free thoſe from all coercive
power who deny all principles of the Chriſtian faith, and
turne ſo from the faith that they deny the word of <hi>God,</hi> the
bookes of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> to be any thing but
phanſied fables, becauſe they teach things moſt controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall;
and ſo upon the grounds of <hi>Libertines,</hi> one Catholicke

ſaith, 1 Tim. 3 1. <hi>Now the Spirit ſpeaketh expreſly that in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

2. <hi>Speaking lyes in hypocriſie, having their conſcience ſeared with an

and ſo muſt be hereticks and worſe.</p>
            <p>2. No rule can be falſer, and more crooked then the
conſcience, for if ye muſt be obliged to follow conſcience,
becauſe it is conſcience, or becauſe right or wrong; if you
muſt follow conſcience becauſe conſcience, yee muſt ever
follow your conſcience, though never ſo wrong; for the
moſt erroneous conſcience is conſcience, though the devill
ſhould immediately actuate it, yet doth not leave off to bee
conſcience, and to be the rule, and if ſo, when the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of ſome ſaith its good ſervice to God to kill the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
of our Lord, becauſe they preach the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> then doe
perſecuters nothing, but what they are in duty bound to
doe, when they murther the Apoſtles, becauſe they preach
the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> for to follow the rule, which God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
muſt be a bounden duty. And the ſame muſt follow, if
the conſcience as evill be the rule, for then ſhould men ſerve
God, in ſacrificing their ſonnes to God, in community and
plurality of wives, when ever their conſcience ſhould dictate
any ſuch thing to be lawfull, though, in it ſelfe, it be moſt
contrary to the word of God. If the conſcience as good,
or as the <hi>Arminians</hi> ſeeme to ſay, as principled with morall
honeſty be our rule, then the conſcience as conſcience is
not the rule, but as it is ruled by morall honeſty, this wee
cannot ſay, for morall honeſty qualifying the conſcience as
a rule, is not able to render the conſcience a ſtreight and
perfect rule in ſupernaturall duties, ſince it is but a naturall
principle in us, and that a moſt corrupt one, by reaſon of ſin,
and how then ſhould it regulate us in all the wayes of the

ſo wee ſay; hee is neither to eate ſimply, nor not to eate
ſimply, but either to eate in faith, or to abſtaine from eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in faith, and without an erring and doubting conſcience:
and we are not to do upon a ſuppoſition, that the conſcience
ſtand erroneous, nor hath the erroneous conſcience any
warrant at all, nor commiſſion from the Sovereigne Lord
of conſcience, to command you to beleeve you muſt be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed,
or upon the ſuppoſall of that faith to obliege
you to be circumciſed, more then any earthly judge hath
a warrant from God to command murther or robery; nor is
it a law of nature, or of God that you muſt do abſolutely and
without trying what an erroneous conſcience indites you to
do, under paine of ſin, nor is it a ſin to reſiſt an eroneous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
by not doing, or ſuſpending the action, more then it
is a ſin not to obey an earthly Judge, when he commandeth
beſide, and contrary to the law of the ſupreame Law-giver.
No wonder they make a Pope of conſcience, who make the

when it is in conſcience, or in any creature,
and it is onely conditionall and limited in the ſtreames,
whereas it was abſolute and ſoveraigne in the fountaine.</p>
            <p>2 In the caſe of an erroneous conſcience ſtanding in its

<hi>what is good,</hi> for theſe two are not contrary, but agree well:
for the Lords command to <hi>Adam (eate not of this fruit</hi>) is to
<hi>Adam</hi> the cauſe why the not eating is good, and the cauſe
of the obligation to what is commanded alſo, but onely
the obligation is (<hi>ad modum facti, non ad factum</hi>) to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>,</hi>
in faith, and perſwaſion without any jarring between
the conſcience and the object, but there is no obligation
to the fact. On the regular way of doing, I am never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieged
to obey God with an erring conſcience, or contrary
to the inditement of an erring conſcience.</p>
            <p>3 The material object being ſin, and forbidden by the law
of <hi>God,</hi> is an object by accident, even when it is propoſed
by practicall reaſon, if that reaſon be erroneous, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed,
as it is in this caſe, the propoſing of practicall
reaſon, doth not make that to bee good or commanded,
which of it ſelfe was neither good nor commanded, but
ſinfull, it may make it good in the manner of doing, and
obliege in the manner of doing, but that is not our queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but whether the practicall judgement and conſcience
remaining erroneous, doth both <hi>ligare,</hi> bind and obliege
to the fact that is ſinfull, that is denied. And though hee
that is circumciſed upon the ſuppoſall of a blind, erring,
and Jewiſh conſcience, thinking the law of ſhaddowes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liegeth
when the body Chriſt is come, he <hi>is a debter to doe the

to keepe the new-Moones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But how is he debter?
He is this way debter, what warrant he hath to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed,
he hath the ſame warrant to keepe the Paſſeover, to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115605:87"/>
ſacrifice, that is, he hath as good reaſon for to doe all, or is
as well obliged upon his falſe principles he goes on, to keep
all the law of ceremonies as to be circumciſed, or doe a part
onely, but he is erroneouſly and ſinfully made, by himſelfe,
a debter to the whole Law, but God made him a debter nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the one, nor to the other, and in Gods Court, though
if he be circumciſed, he muſt be circumciſed this way, that is,
his conſcience muſt dictate that Gods Law ſtill in force
commands him ſo to doe, but this is but a neceſſity of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
that falleth upon the manner of the doing, not
upon the fact, for no Law of God warranteth him to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed,
and no Law of God makes him debter to doe all
the reſt of the law of ceremonies, he is obliged neither to be
circumciſed erroneouſly, nor to abſtaine from circumciſion
erroneouſly, but to lay aſide his erroneous conſcience, and to
abſtaine from circumciſion according to the enditement of
a well informed conſcience.</p>

and why then ſhould the Magiſtrate compell and
force men to theſe duties which are to be done in faith, and

            <p>1. Every duty of the <hi>Chriſtian Magiſtrate,</hi> hath warrant

ſuch a toleration is no duty of the Magiſtrate; the major is
cleare from the perfection of the word of God; the aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

it is no where written expreſly, or by conſequence, to be the
duty of the Ruler, therefore it is not his duty to tolerate or

               <p>If it be replyed, becauſe it is not holden forth in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be the Rulers duty to puniſh men for their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

once delivered to the Saints,</hi> Jud. 3. one truth to be bought,

<hi>Without wavering,</hi> Heb. 13. 9.</p>
               <p>For the aſſumption: That God hath appointed in his
revealed will, that every man ſhould ſerve God as beſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
him, and as it ſeemes good in his owne erronious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and that every man ſhould pervert the ſoule of his
brother, and the Magiſtrate ſhould put no man to ſhame for
it, is as good as if there were no Magiſtrate, and that it is
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115605:92"/>
againſt his calling as a Magiſtrate, is clear, for the Holy Ghoſt
ſaith, that, Jud. 16. 5. <hi>Micah had a houſe of Gods, and made an
Ephod, and a Teraphim, and conſecrated one of his ſonnes, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came

King in Iſrael, but every man did that which was right in his owne

<hi>Micah</hi> and others ſerve not God as it ſeemes good to their

not another Religion, and a third, another third Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,

               <p>2. If the Magiſtrate reſtraine not the high places, for
which he is rebuked, as ſome ſacrifice at Jeruſalem at
Gods command; ſo the people for the moſt part ſacrifice
in the high place through the Princes fault, and then there
bee two Religions, and upon the ſame ſinfull indulgence
they may multiply groves, and <hi>alters according to the number

muſt bee tolerated to doe the like, and others the like, till
Religions bee multiplyed: and this wee muſt ſay, except

of our nature is not ſo great, through neglect of
Magiſtracy to doe what ſeemes good in our owne eyes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

ſhould there be a Magiſtracy under the New Teſtament to

The Propoſition is cleare for the places of Scriptures

Men are not to be troubled for their conſcience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

their hope may be grounded on a lye, their comfort
not bottomed on the Scripture, and ſo falſe hope and

Saint or Profeſſour beleeves and publiſhes, hee is to

ſtand in fencing ſome moral tranſgreſſions utterly from the

doe now, Mat. 28. 19, 20. And as Chriſt ſaith now, preach
the Goſpel, but kill none, uſe neither ſtaffe nor ſword, nor
miraculous power to deſtroy hereticks, or burn Samaria, ſo

and Maſter, yea, and of the Father now in the ſtate of ſin

by ſtrong hand, either to doe or ſuffer the will of God,
which is ſufficient to prove our poynt. Though it be true,

Prince may now puniſh it with death, but it followes not
therefore, ſuch tranſgreſſors are made free, through Chriſt

Chriſt is come and aſcended, and hath put an end to all
ſhadowes and types by the comming in the body, to eat
manna, if they were in the wilderneſſe, and drinke water
out of the rocky mountaines, if thirſty, and dwell in their
owne land, if the Lord ſhould reſtore them to it, yet ſhould
they not Judaize nor recall the types of <hi>Moſes,</hi> for theſe
they ſhould doe for a naturall and phyſicall, and for no
Religious uſe. Now granting that ſtoning of blaſphemers
were typicall, and as typicall as hanging of robbers was,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 21. yet ſhould it never follow that ſtoning of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers

civill uſe, even of common and naturall equity, that
he that thus perverteth the right wayes of the Lord, and
ſeduceth others ſhould dye the death. Yea this may well
infer that propheſying of lyes, blaſpheming were typicall
ſinnes againſt a ceremoniall and temporary law, and ſo
they are not now ſinnes, yea becauſe it is a falling from
Chriſt to obſerve Jewiſh ſhadows, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. not to blaſpheme,

and other Prophets no where reprove <hi>David</hi> ſparing the life
of <hi>Joab</hi> a murtherer. When Chriſt reproved the Sadduces, for
denying the reſurrection, he reproves, by conſequence, both
Church and State for tollerating the denying of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
and ſuppoſeth the tolleration of it to be againſt
the law of God.</p>
            <p>2. It is no argument at all from 1. A negative fact.
2. In ſuch a particular Scripture, to prove the lawfulneſſe
of tolleration. Let then anſwer this, Chriſt that was
a faithfull Preacher to State and Church, no where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth
in the Goſpell, the tolleration of the extortion
of Publicans, Sodomie, murther, the abſolving of a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer
at the feaſt, a bloody tolleration, denying of God,
blaſphemy; <hi>ergo,</hi> it was lawfull for the Church and State to
ſuffer all theſe.</p>
            <p>3. This anſwer inferreth that the <hi>Church</hi> ſhould tollerate
all falſe doctrines, and the denying of the reſurrection, and
that there ſhould be no Church cenſure, contrary to <hi>Mat.</hi> 18
yea <hi>Chriſt</hi> does no where rebuke the <hi>Phariſees, Scribes</hi> and
<hi>Prieſts,</hi> becauſe they did not, by preaching, admoniſh and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:115605:113"/>
convince their fellows the Sadduces of that hereticall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
that the dead ſhall not riſe, and by this there ſhould
be not onely a Phyſicall tolleration, and a non puniſhing
by the Magiſtrate of all hereſies, but a morall forbearing,
and a no-rebuking, no preaching againſt falſe wayes, and ſo
not onely Church-cenſures are taken away contrary to
<hi>Matth. 18. 15, 16, 17. Revel.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 14, 15, 16, 20. But it is

the Publicans to extort the people, nor <hi>Caeſar</hi> and

him in his ſinne, and ſave him from the hand of Juſtice, that
City forfeited its typicall holineſſe, and it, and all things in

the puniſhing of infants, and burning of the ſpoyle was a

have no zeale at all to puniſh falſe teachers under the New

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is yet to object againſt the Holy Ghoſt, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us, for the text will bear no ſuch thing, for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
that is to be thruſt through, is not every ſonne, nor
for every error. But it is 1. A falſe Prophet not called to
be a Prophet, but one that takes <hi>on a hairy mantle to deceive,</hi> as
the 4. v. holds forth; and ſo he pretends a calling from <hi>God,</hi>
when he hath none. 2. He propheſies not errors only but lies,
that hee knowes, or may know, except he were wilfully
ignorant, to be lyes. 3. <hi>He ſpeaks them in the name of the Lord</hi>
and ſayes, he hath <hi>ſeene the viſions of God, and the word of the

            <p>2 The text will not bear that his father and his mother
with their owne hands ſhall thruſt him through, without
addreſſing themſelves to the Judge. But it is an alluſion
to the Law, Deut. 13. <hi>His father and mother ſhall not pity him,</hi>

this Propheſie to the Church of the Jewes, and a poore

as in other places it muſt be taken, as <hi>Ier.</hi> 50. 4. v. 20. <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.

in Chriſts Goſpel-Kingdome, and then the Law,
piercing through, and terrifying, muſt be in uſe under the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:115605:117"/>
Goſpel, which is all we crave; therefore the <hi>Objector</hi> adds to
the words of the threatning; <hi>thou ſhalt not live</hi> (to wit
before God, and ſo leaps from the threatning of the
ſword of the Magiſtrate, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. which hee ſaith is the
ſenſe of the place, to the ſecond death, and a dying before
God.</p>
            <p>2. But let us have an inſtance where piercing through,
dying and wounding, is put for Metaphoricall wounding
with words to gratifie, the Objectors erroneous ſenſe wee
cannot quit this place ſo, for all the Text cryes for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
piercing and killing.</p>
            <p>1. It is I grant an eaſie way to anſwer places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that can but bear a literall ſenſe, to change them into
Metaphors, ſo you may give to the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> with ſome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 13. a Metaphoricall ſword, and pay him
metaphoricall tribute, and give him metaphoricall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
what more reaſon to make this a morall ſlaying, and
piercing with words, then a morall or metaphoricall Idol,
or a metaphoricall falſe Prophet, a metaphoricall uncleane
ſpirit, and paſſing out of the land? Theſe words, <hi>thou
ſhalt not live,</hi> are words of the Law, and the piercing
through metaphoricall, but thoſe words, againe (<hi>Thou
ſpeakeſt lies in the name of the Lord</hi>) are not metaphoricall, but
containe a proper truth, ſuch a complication is not in all
the Scripture.</p>
            <p>2. The words in their literall ſenſe are faire and eaſie,
and not to bee wreſted to a ſpirituall or borrowed ſenſe
without ground; it much leſſeneth the zeale foretold to be
under the Goſpel, and turnes a reall zeale <hi>over into words of
threatning;</hi> the Text ſaith the contrary, his father ſhall thruſt
him through, and this works ſo upon him, that others
ſhall really leave their falſe prophecying, and ſhall ſay, <hi>I
am no Prophet, but a Herdman;</hi> now if the words be a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
to be fulfilled only in the Jewes excluding the Gentiles,
as the Objector ſaith, then is it no zeale at all, but a moſt
ſinfull and unjuſt diſpencing with the Law, and a zeale far
below the Law; for the Law ſaith, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. If the ſeducing
Prophet which were as neer to thee, <hi>as a Brother, Son, Daughter,
or Wife in thy boſome,</hi> thou muſt not ſmooth him, and oyle
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:115605:117"/>
him with ſharpe words, and meer threatnings; yea, but
thou muſt act againſt him, v. 8. <hi>Thine eye ſhall not pitie him, thou
ſhall not ſpare him, neither ſhalt thou conceale him. 9. Thou ſhalt ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
kill him,</hi> thine hand <hi>ſhall be firſt upon him, to put him to death.</hi>
Now this cannot be a metaphoricall putting to death, but
the Objectors metaphoricall, and minatory piercing of him
through with ſharpe and piercing words, imply neceſſarily
that yee muſt conceale him, and pitie him, and not kill
him, nor ſtretch out any hand againſt him, firſt or laſt to
hurt him, but only ſtretch your tongue againſt him, and
barely threaten him, and terrifie him, but let him live: If
the Prophecie be extended to <hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> under the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi>
which againſt the Text the Objector denies, then it
argues, 1. That there is ſuch a Law under the Goſpel, elſe
if it be an unjuſt Law, and out of date now under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
the threatning and piercing through muſt bewith lying
words, and father muſt utter to the lying Prophet lies to
terrifie him; and ſay, ſon if thou deſiſt not from prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying
lies, thou ſhalt be thruſt through with the Magiſtrates
ſword, and die according to the Law; that is, I foreſhew
and threaten according to the Law (but it is an unjuſt, and
an out-dated Law to Libertines that obliegeth not under
the New Teſtament) that thou ſhalt be thruſt through and
die; that is, I fore-ſhew and propheſie a lie, that thou ought
to be put to death, and perſecuted for thy conſcience;
whereas no ſuch thing ought to be now, when the Law,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 13. is worne out of vigor. 2. It muſt follow that ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and falſe words uttered in a threatning manner muſt
be the way to cauſe the falſe Prophet to bee aſhamed of his
viſion and propheſying falſely no more, but ſay, <hi>I am no
Prophet but an herdman.</hi> Whereas the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> ſayth, feare
of thruſting through is the cauſe.</p>
            <p>3 If it be onely a piercing meerly minatory, by threatning
and rebukes, theſe doe not change the Prophet and gaine
him to the truth, as the <hi>Objector</hi> would imply, for refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in a doctrinall, and inſtructing, and teaching way on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doth that: no rebukes no law-threatnings doe change
the falſe Prophet, for threatnings and rebukes doe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the ſeducer ſeeth that hee ſeduceth, and that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propheſieth
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:115605:118"/>
lyes which yet the falſe Prophet cannot ſee,
till hee bee convinced of the errour of his way, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes
will not doe that. But I would put to the Objector
his owne quere, is it fit to rebuke a man who can doe no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
but publiſh lyes, becauſe he lacketh ſupernatural grace,
which would make him a true Prophet? Theſe words v. 6.
<hi>What are thoſe wounds in thy hands?</hi> hold forth a viſible and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
piercing through of the hands, for ſome falſe doctrine
hee hath preached, according to the merit of his here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
then it muſt bee ſome other thing then a verball
threate or a metaphoricall piercing through with words
which are tranſient, and not parmanent, and viſible as
wounds and print of ſtroakes, <hi>cicatrices,</hi> in the hands: ſo I
cannot but think the <hi>Objector</hi> hath ſtrained his light to find
a violent expoſition to elude the place.</p>
            <p>Its true, that <hi>Da. Chytreus</hi> and <hi>Melanthon</hi> acknowledge a
confutation of errours by words, but <hi>Chytreus</hi> in the ſame
place on this text, goeth farther, <hi>they ſhall confute falſe teachers</hi>

Now the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor and Senate were not ſuch

it ſignifies here. I deny the propoſition, the ſcopes of the

of men, but here the <hi>Ground</hi> is the World. 2. In the
former, <hi>Chriſt</hi> expones the ſeede to be the Word: Here hee
expones it to bee the <hi>children of the Kingdome,</hi> and of the
wicked one. 3. In the former there are not two ſeedes,
good and ill, and two births, but rather foure, the way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide-men,
the thorny-men, the rocky-men, the good and
fruiteful-hearers, and here there be but two ſeeds, the ſeed
of wheate and of tares. 4. The ſcope of the former is to
ſhow who heare fruitfully the Goſpel, who not, this hath
no ſuch ſcope, but to compoſe our raſhneſſe in quarrelling
with God that he ſuffers the wicked to have the benefit of
the ſoyle, hedge, ſunne, raine, dew, with the godly, and to
live untill harveſt.</p>

of the word of the Kingdome, that muſt be meant here by the ſeed,
and wheate.</hi> It is a falſe propoſition, and a connexion of
hay and ſand. 2. Chriſt <hi>came</hi> to ſave the loſt, to give his
life a ranſome for many. <hi>Ergo,</hi> by this argument the good
ſeed ſhould hold forth the redeemed of God. 2. The aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
is falſe, to wit, <hi>that Chriſt came to be a King,</hi> yea, and
as principally to be a Prieſt, to offer himſelf for the ſinnes
of the world, to give his life for his ſheep, and goates muſt
rather be meant by Wheat and Tares then any other thing.</p>

            <p>5. The Authour inſinuates as much, as not to give them
liberty of conſcience, as a reward of their valorous fighting,
is diſſervice to the State. But ingenuous workmen ſpeake

            <p>The Covenant with a faire interpretation may be urged againſt

The Covenant binds no man, nor number of men to State or Church for
their parts reſpectively, to any paterne or degree of Reformation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
or uniformity with other Churches, but what ſhall ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily

the word of God; and ſuch a Reformation doe the Congregationall men
deſire, pray, preach, endeavovr for and after, in the purſuance of the
Covenant, as if there had beene no ſuch outward Covenant obliging
them, would yee have men driven in droves to the Sacrament ſtill, and
the pretious and the vile mixed? and Idol-ſhepheards ſuffered? and

            <p>3 The Argument, of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> cannot conclude that God
is leſſe watchful, and leſſe ſevere to take vengeance on Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers,
Murtherers, Lions and cruel tyrants, bloody and
deceitful men, than againſt new falſe religions, for if the
way of Robbers, Conſpirators, Armies that riſe in rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
againſt their maſters, Covenant-breakers, bee of men,
God wil bring it to nought and deſtroy it, as he overturned
the way of <hi>Theudas</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> as is cleare. <hi>God turnes the way of
the wicked upſidedown,</hi> Pſ. 146. 9. <hi>And the bloody and deceitfull man
ſhall not live halfe his days,</hi> Pſ. 55. 23. <hi>And ſo ſhall the old Lion periſh
for want of his prey,</hi> Job 4. 11. <hi>and ſhall want and ſuffer hunger,</hi>
Pſalm. 34. 10. <hi>ergo, Iob</hi> or any Magiſtrate ſhould refraine
from plucking the prey out of the Jawes of the oppreſſours,
contrary to <hi>Iob</hi> 29. 16, 17. or if the way of Oppreſſors bee
of God, and if God have armed them with his power to be
a ſcourge, Rulers ſhould not defend the fatherleſſe, the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and the ſtranger, from the pawes of the Lions and
Murtherers, but ſhould refrain; why? If Gods power bee
with them, we reſiſt the power of God, we fight againſt God.
Nor is it enough that the patron of liberty, Servetus <hi>and</hi>
Goodwin <hi>tell us in doubtſome things, ſuch as controverſies of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we would refraine from drawing the ſword againſt men, for their
conſcience and religion, becauſe we know not infallibly, but their way
may be as well or rather the way of God, than our own, and then wee
run the hazzard of fighting againſt God Omnipotent; and when it
is dubious to us, but it may be the way of men, it is ſafeſt to leave it
to God, and that we hold back our hand from offering violerce to them,
for God will ſave our labour, and burne the hay and ſtubble of mens
droſſie inventions, and what need then is there to file the edge of the

becauſe wee know not infallibly, but their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-goſpell

God himſelf will have it reſerved to him, that he

to <hi>gather to themſelves an heap of teachers,</hi> by preaching

we are no more to convince, refute, and rebuke falſe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
except we could do it in faith and aſſurance, that their
way is of men and falſe (ſince all we do, or do not, ſpeak,
or ſpeak not, muſt be in the perſwaſion of faith, elſe we
ſinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 12, 14, 22, 23.) then Chriſtian <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> can

a way of God (for ſo the heretick to death under
torturing Profeſſeth) and you have no faith, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
(ſay <hi>Libertines</hi>) with the tongue, nor with the hand.
Yea, we can no more labour to ſuppreſſe what God onely,
in his ſole prerogative of providence, immediately work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ought to ſuppreſſe, and that in a mediate providence
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:115605:158"/>
of our own making, with preaching, refuting, watching
over the flock, ſtopping the mouthes of gain-ſayers, then
we can indeavour the ſuppreſſing of it with the ſword.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Gamaliel</hi> intended to have the Apoſtles, not to be med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with, either becauſe godly men, and Diſciples of Chriſt,
as he was; or becauſe their way was dubiouſly, not no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
and manifeſtly falſe; if the former, Then 1. Godly
men, though in an evill way, though they murther, play
the Traytor, Rebell, commit adultery, are not to be any
way cenſured. This is the way of <hi>Anabaptiſme,</hi> that ſets
all beleevers above and beyond the reach of the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi>
ſword, and his dilemma cannot have this ſenſe; for if god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men, as godly men are upon this formall reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
godly men muſt not be puniſhed by the <hi>Magiſtrate;</hi>
neither muſt they ever at all be puniſhed for the acts of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
or murthering, or treacherous dealing, or adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
for it is cleere in the perſon of <hi>David, Lot,</hi> and others,
that they remained godly, and Saints, under thoſe acts.

but that <hi>God</hi> uſed him as a morall moderate wiſe man, to

2. <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> can have no better grounds then <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi>

body was found with the reliques of <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus,</hi>
as <hi>Baronius</hi> ſaith, <hi>Clemens</hi> in his <hi>Recog. li. 1. c. 9. Beda</hi> ſaith,

            <p>2. The mature object of the Diſciples furious and blinde
zeale was not Religion, but refuſing of lodging moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanely
to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Samaritans did not receive
him, for his face was as though he would go to Jeruſalem,</hi> Luke
9. 51. and the <hi>Samaritans</hi> ſo maliced and envied the Jewes,
that becauſe he aimed to go to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> being ſo glorious
a Prophet, and famous for holineſſe among them, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
him lodging. Then ſurely they had an eſteeme of

they did to <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

cannot be called Hereticks; and we confeſſe, to burn Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
becauſe the in-dwellers are of a falſe Religion, is no
fit way to convert them to the true Religion; and becauſe
the Apoſtles, to whom God hath not given the ſword, but

            <p>I Anſwer there is not the like reaſon: for God and nature
have given to the ſtrongeſt, a <hi>jus</hi> and authority over oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
to repel unjuſt violence, with innocent violence but that
we ſhould force the true Religion on Idolators, we have not
the like ground, except they did attempt to obtrude their
falſe ways upon us, and injure our ſoules: for there is a vaſt
difference between a people never receiving the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and a people who have imbraced, and ſubmitted to
lawes, that have inacted the profeſſion of the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
thoſe that never profeſſed the true Religion, cannot
bee compelled to receive it by the Sword of another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
except they firſt ſubdue them in a juſt warre, and be

ſubdued people, and diſcharge the duty of parents to them,
and impoſe lawes on themſelves, to caſt away the Idols of

God: but they cannot make the not receiving of the true
Religion the ground of a war: for we read not of any ſuch
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:115605:166"/>

and will of man: <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſuch a puniſhing of a ſeducing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
muſt be by the revealed will of God in his word. The

            <p>2 The Propoſition is proved, becauſe the will of God
can be the Creator, and firſt Author of nothing, but which
is morrally good. For the Scripture is as full in the duties
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:115605:170"/>
of the ſecond table touching mercy and righteouſneſſe, as
in the duties of the firſt, touching piety and religion, and
any thing pretended to be morrall, hath God for its authour,
in either the firſt or the ſecond table of the Law, nor can
the will of man be the author of any thing morrally good,
and will-righteouſneſſe, is as unlawfull as will-worſhip, or
will-piety, ſince the word is a perfect rule in matters of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
or faith, or of life, manners and converſation, and
teacheth the Judge what he ſhould doe, <hi>Deut. 17. 18, 19, 20.

            <p>3 What ever by order of juſtice, doth concerne the life
and death of our neighbour, rewarding or puniſhing him
in name, body, goods, ſo as if it bee juſtly inflicted, it
is juſtice; and if unduely and undeſervedly, it is unjuſtice,
and murther: as wronging of him in his body by ſtripes,

ſhame on him, far more muſt the Ruler bee taught of
God, what ſhame he ſhould put on him. For what ever
under the New Teſtament is capable of a command, is
morall. And if morall, what the Magiſtrate ſhould doe
to him can no more be determined by the will and wit of
man, than it can be determined what puniſhment the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
muſt inflict upon the murtherer, the adulterer, the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer,
the <hi>Sodomite;</hi> which all the wiſdom of God hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined:
in the word, otherways God hath left the Magiſtrate
in the dark, that from the word he hath no direction, when
he committeth murther, or when he doth acts of juſtice. And
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:115605:170"/>
that it is a morall act alſo to ſeduce ſoules is cleare, in
that, 1. We are commanded to <hi>beware of ſuch.</hi> Matth. 7. 5.
and <hi>avoid them,</hi> Tit. 3. 10. Rom. 16. 17. 2. That the Lord
condemneth them in his word, as ſuch as make their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
<hi>the children of perdition,</hi> Yea Matth. 22. 15. They <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert

<hi>Lead ſilly women Captive,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. are <hi>Deceivers,</hi> Tit. 1. 10.
Now that God hath appointed a puniſhment for this of
old, and hath ſpoken againſt this ſinne ſo much in the New
Teſtament, and bidden private Chriſtians, cry ſhame on
Seducers, and fly them, and yet left the Magiſtrate under a
diſcharge, and inhibition to draw a ſword againſt ſuch: who
can beleeve it? except that inhibition given to the Chriſtian
Magiſtrate wer written in the Teſtament of our Lord. To ſay
the new Teſtament-diſpenſation is ſo ſpirituall that God
wil have no remedying of ſeducing, but by the ſpirituall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor

<hi>Jeremiah</hi> argues not from any judiciall Law, when he ſaith,
<hi>The Prophets that ſpeake lies in the name of the Lord, ſhall die by

(who had nothing but the Law of nature) that they
periſhed; for no Judiciall Law of God taught them, that
he ought to die by the ſword of the Magiſtrate, who ſpeaks

that <hi>Jeremiah</hi> had prophecied truth, and was ſent of

the light of nature, that teacheth all <hi>Magiſtrates, Heathen</hi>
and <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> to puniſh publike impoſtors, falſe Prophets
and liers, as moſt pernitious enemies to the peace of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Societies. And if the Law of nature and Nations
dictate to all Societies, That deceivers, and ſuch as raiſe
falſe reports and lies upon earthly Judges, ſhould be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed;
far more is it a principle of the Law of nature, that
publike lyers, and ſuch as ſpeake lies in the name of the
Lord, and deceive and ſeduce the ſoules of father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
King and Ruler, and of all ranks of men in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
ſhould not be tollerated in the ſociety. And what
though Emperours and Kings have abuſed the power that
God gave them for the truth, to perſecute the ſervants of
Chriſt for the truth, it followes not, but they had juſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
as the Miniſters of God, to puniſh ſeducing Prophets,
as well as other ill-doers, by the law of nature and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

Prieſt only. To <hi>Paſhur;</hi> then the Officers had but the word
of <hi>Peſhur</hi> to put <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in the ſtockes, and the people had
but the Prieſts word for ſtoning the man.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Query,</hi> Were the people infallible in diſcerning the
Prieſt to be a true relater of the mind of God from the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle?
How beleeved they then ſome lying Prieſts who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
the Prophets of God?</p>
            <p>3 <hi>Query,</hi> Was the Prieſt infallible in diſcerning the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
and relating the mind of God to the people? How
then did they ſay, <hi>he is worthy to dye?</hi> How did <hi>Caiaphas</hi> ſay,
<hi>What need we any more witneſſe,</hi> We have heard himſelf blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme?</p>
            <p>4 Were not the Prieſts <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. ver. 11. To Judge <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the ſentence of the Law of God</hi> delivered to <hi>Moſes?</hi> Was
this an immediate Oracle of infallibility, ſuch as <hi>Bellarmin,
Becanus, Gretſorus, Valentia Corn. a lapide</hi> aſcribe to their <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi>
at <hi>Rome?</hi> I thinke Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> cannot ſay that. If he
doe, I know what to anſwer to the Papiſts in that. If it
was the <hi>law and the teſtimony,</hi> as I conceive it was, had not
all the people that were to ſtone the ſeducing Prophet, their
way of judging the falſe Prophet? If they muſt not follow
him after other Gods, and if they muſt be actors in ſtoning
him. And was not this fallible as well as ours under the
new Teſtament? and therefore, becauſe we are not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:115605:174"/>
judging in the heart-Heretick; we muſt not draw the
Sword againſt him; and I ſay, nor can we draw the Sword
of the Spirit againſt any ſuch; for in the uſing of the Sword
of the Spirit, in teaching, refuting, or arguing againſt He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks;
we are not infallible. If this way of Peoples judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and not liſtening to the ſuggeſtions of a falſe Prophet
was infallible, how erred they, and ſlew <hi>the true Prophets, and
ſtoned them that were ſent,</hi> Matth. 23. 27. As well as we may?
And why may not we, notwithſtanding of our fallibility
and actuall erring, judge and drive away by the ſword, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers
of the flock, as well as they?</p>
            <p>6. If God have left no means under the New Teſtament,
but exhorting, to ſuppreſſe the ſeducer, what ſhall be ſaid
of <hi>Iohn 2 Epiſt.</hi> 10. who forbids to receive a ſeducer in our
houſe, or <hi>bid him God ſpeed.</hi> Sure this is ſome externall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing

God, as <hi>Libertines</hi> ſay, we are to judge no mans heart, and
that in a matter of ſalvation, no man will be ſo Devill-like
as to go to hell, and leade millions of ſoules with him,
the way being againſt his conſcience. For <hi>Ier. Taylor</hi> ſaith,
It is all one here,<note place="margin">Liberty of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying.</note> whether it be a reall truth the Seducer
holdeth and teacheth, or if he onely apprehend it to be a
truth, though it be an untruth; and he ſaid well according
to his way. Now, if to teach (I ſay) what we conceive to
be truth, though moſt falſe, be no ſinne, but innocency,
then the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> ought not onely not to puniſh it, but
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:115605:175"/>
reward it; and to allow ſtipends and maintenance to all
Seducers, to teach what errors they judge ſaving truths.
And grant me theſe three, which cannot be denied but by
groſſe <hi>Anabaptiſts, 1. Rom.</hi> 13. That the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> is to
reward well doing. 2. That the workeman is worthy of
his wages, 1 <hi>Tim. 5. 18, 19. Matth.</hi> 10. 10. And 3 That a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
Miniſtry is neceſſary under the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> 1 Cor,
1. 16, 17, 18. 23, 24. Rom. 10. 14, 15, 16. Then muſt it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of neceſſity, That the <hi>Chriſtian Magiſtrate</hi> ſhould main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
and pay ſtipends to all Preachers, whether ſound, and
Orthodox, or Heterodox, and ſeducing; for if he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
maintenance, as a Magiſtrate, or any other way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he judgeth the Preacher to be unſound, and a ſeducer,
he taketh upon himſelfe to puniſh a man for his conſcience,
when as he hath no infallibility; and he doth ſo puniſh and
force the conſcience of the innocent Paſtor and People both.
For he is obliged to judge, that both the ſound Paſtor and
the Seducer follow their conſcience; and whatever the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of either be, Orthodox or Heterodox, he is to judge
that both followeth his innocent conſcience, and in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
both feareth God, and doth well; and by his <hi>Office</hi>
he is for the praiſe and reward of well doers: And ſuppoſe
he judge in his conſcience, that the Doctrine of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer
is error and Hereſie, yet is he to judge it Hereſie with
a reſerve, ſo as it may be to him the next moneth ſound
Doctrine; and therefore not to judge otherwayes of the
Seducer, than that he followeth the dictates of his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
And ſo as yet he doth not take on him infallibility to
judge, that the Seducer teacheth againſt the light of his
conſcience, and therefore is not to puniſh him, but reward
him, and pay wages to him, as to a well doer: Yea, and
whatever Miniſters teach, ſince neither they are infallible in
teaching the very fundamentals, nor the people that heare
infallible in judging, and neither are to beleeve with the
perſwaſion of faith; And all are to be heard as inſtructors.
For ſuppoſe you believe that Chriſt is God conſubſtantiall
with the father, yet are you to heare <hi>Arrius</hi> preach, and
to admit a contrary light. If <hi>Arrius</hi> can make the contrary
appeare to your minde, and <hi>Arrius</hi> preacheth according to
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:115605:175"/>
the light of his mind, and there is no reaſon why you
ſhould not be inſtructed by the Seducer (for you are to try
his doctrine) as well as by the ſound teacher, for you have
no infallible knowledge who is the ſeducer, or who is the
ſound Teacher, by the principles of Libertines.</p>
            <p>The third cannot be ſaid, to wit, That it is indifferent to
drive away people from the true God; for it muſt either
be good and praiſe worthy, or evill, and ſo puniſhable,
againſt which we have ſufficiently argued.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argument</hi> 4 What the Magiſtrate is foreprophecied to be
under the New Teſtament,<note place="margin">The Magiſtrate as a Magiſtrate according to prophecies in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſeducers.</note> that he muſt diſcharge with all
the power God hath given him, and that perpetually, and
not by the tie of a judicial and temporary law, which binds
for a time only. But the Magiſtrate is fore-prophefied <hi>Iſai.</hi>
49. 23. and 60. 10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 26. to be a Nurſe-father to the
Church under the New Teſtament, to keep and guard both
Tables of the Law, and to ſee that Paſtors doe their dutie, to
<hi>miniſter to the Church</hi> by his royal power, yea when the <hi>fountain
ſhall be opened in</hi> Davids <hi>houſe, that is under the New Teſtament, he
ſhall thruſt through the falſe Prophet that ſpeaketh lies in the Name of
the Lord, Zach.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Kings as Kings muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
ſome royall ſervice to the Church, over which they are
Nurſe-fathers. But all the power that Kings have, is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
co-active, and in order to rewarding or puniſhing,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 3, 4. therefore they muſt confer coactive ſervice.
<hi>Piſcator</hi> ſaith well, <hi>That the Prince is called the keeper of both
Tables of the Law by our Divines,</hi> therefore he is to vindicate
Gods glory in both. He that hath the keeping of two
pits, one more horrible and dark, another more mild and
heartſome for two malefactors, a theef, and an adulterer,
he muſt not caſt the theef in ſuch a dark dungeon as the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer:
So if the Magiſtrate keep both Tables, he muſt
not puniſh according to his own will,<note place="margin">Bloody Tenet c. 125. p. 214. What Maſter Williams gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is not ſufficient.</note> but according to
the rule and preſcript of God. Nor ſaith the Author of
the <hi>Bloody Tenet</hi> any thing, when he tels us that the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
owes to the true Religion; 1. Approbation and reverend e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem.</hi>
2. <hi>Perſonall ſubmiſſion to the ſpirituall government,</hi> Mat. 18.
1 Cor. 5. 3. <hi>Protection to the Subjects whether they be apart or

               <pb n="322" facs="tcp:115605:176"/>
Mat. 13. 30. 2. <hi>Protection from violence to their perſons
and eſtates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> All this is very nothing, 1. Approbation and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to truth is no royall power. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> giveth a pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
and fatherly power to the King in Church matters,
when he ſaith, <hi>He ſhall be a nurſe-father.</hi> Now all he gives
in theſe two former points, to wit, approbation of, and
ſubmiſſion to truth, is no more then any tradeſman or ſon
owes to the Church: So <hi>Iſaiah</hi> makes the King a father;
this author makes him a ſon ſubject to the Church, which
ſubjection I deny not in another conſideration, but that as
a nurſe-father he ſhould approve the truth, and ſubmit
thereunto, as all the members of the Church, makes him
both a father and a ſon; a commander, and a humble ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive
obeyer in the ſame conſid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ration, which is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictorious
and uncongruous, for he muſt ſpeak of him as
a Ruler, or elſe he ſaith nothing. The third thing which
is, <hi>protection to the true Church</hi> is nothing to the purpoſe; for
that he owes to them as ſubjects, not as they are ſerving God
in the duties of the firſt Table, for the King by this man
can neither command them nor forbid them, by his Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall
or coactive power to ſerve God, or not to ſerve him,
in the duties of the firſt Table, and by the <hi>true Church</hi> that
the King owes protection to, the Author meaneth not the
Church that is in it ſelf ſound and true, but the Church
that ſeemeth and appeareth ſo to the conſcience of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
though moſt erronious. Now this is the Church
of <hi>Seekers</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> but ſuppoſe the Magiſtrate or
Commander in war be a <hi>Familiſt,</hi> a groſſe <hi>Anabaptiſt;</hi> the
Author will not ſay, That he ought to protect the Church
aſſembled to worſhip God, and to excommunicate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
to Satan ſuch as <hi>ſubvert the faith of many,</hi> and ſay the
<hi>Reſurrection is already paſt,</hi> or that he ought to protect an <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
of Divines</hi> that are for Presbyteriall Government,
and the truth that <hi>Calvin</hi> and our Reformers delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
Theſe are to him Antichriſtian Synagogues; or if he
owe them protection, he ought to offer violence with his
ſword, to <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> ſuch as roſe in <hi>Germany</hi> under <hi>John Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cold</hi>
of <hi>Leydon,</hi> that out of meer principles of Religion, killed
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:115605:176"/>
all that were not of their way, and to diſplace, impriſon,
and confine <hi>Presbiterians.</hi> So yet in a defenſive way the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
muſt offer violence to the conſcience of men, who
for meer Religious grounds doe labour to ſcatter and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
to hinder the meetings of the ſervants of God: for
how many of the Sectaries of <hi>England</hi> who are for liberty of
conſcience have come into Churches in <hi>England,</hi> and ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
up to the Pulpit, and hindered the Miniſter the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of his conſcience to the flock, and offered violence
to the meeting of the true Church? now it is not enough
to ſay the Miniſter was but an Antichriſtian ſervice-book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and it was no true Church whoſe ſervice ſuch Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
interrupted; but giving and not granting it were ſo,
yet are <hi>Libertines</hi> not to offer violence to the conſcience
of any Church true or falſe, if they be true to their own
principles: but this Author being an <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> and a <hi>Seeker</hi>
will ſay neither warres nor ſuch violence are lawfull, but
if ſo, the Magiſtrate then cannot with the ſword protect
the true Church againſt the violence of men, who upon
meer conſcience diſturbe their Aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>2. To <hi>Libertines</hi> all Churches profeſſing true Religion (as
all Churches on earth, <hi>Indians,</hi> and <hi>Mahometanians</hi> not excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
do) muſt be true Churches, for they are not to judge, but
that they follow their conſcience,<note place="margin">Chriſtian kings are no more nurſe-fathers Iſai. 49. 23. to the true Churches of Chriſt, then to the Synagogue of Antichriſt according to the way of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.</note> and ſo the Magiſtrate ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

&amp; even for ſuch as they conceive to be true Churches,
they are not infallibly perſwaded they are ſuch, and ſo the
Magiſtrate gives no protection to them as true Churches,

being made Nurſe-fathers to the true Church, owe nothing

for the place <hi>Iſai.</hi> 60. cryes to him that runs and will read,
that Kings ſhall miniſter ſomething to the true Church,
which they doe in no ſort to the falſe Church, and it is
moſt evident to the judicious Reader, <hi>that the ſucking of the
breaſts of Kings,</hi> v. 10. 16. and <hi>the kiſsing of the Son,</hi> Pſal. 2.
muſt be more then common protection to Subjects that

Affirmanti incumbit probatio,</hi> Our Adverſaries are obliged to

Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ye all ſpeak the ſame thing, and that there
be no diviſions among you, but that ye be perfectly joyned together in

if they dwell together peaceably, why but they may marry
together, <hi>Achab</hi> then in marrying the King of the <hi>Zidonians</hi>

<hi>Clotildis</hi> the daughter of <hi>Clodoveus</hi> married <hi>Almaricus</hi> the

not that the Prophet ought to compell any, nor that the
Sword is an ordinance of God to convert oppreſſars, and
murtherers, to turn meek and righteous judges, co-action by
fire and ſword in Old or New Teſtament can convert none

<hi>Think not I am come to deſtroy the Law, &amp;c. 18. For verily I ſay

muſt utterly deſtroy the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſubſtitute a

more perfect Law in the place thereof. But <hi>Libertines,</hi> as
<hi>Joh. Baptiſt</hi> here, would have hereſie forbidden in the Old
Teſtament, and puniſhing of falſe propheſying commanded
there. But hereſie muſt be Innocency, and Righteouſneſſe
in the New Teſtament, and to be puniſhed for falſe teaching
in the old was to ſuffer for ill-doing; but now in the New
(ſaith <hi>Baptiſt</hi>) to be puniſhed for falſe propheſying is to
ſuffer for <hi>well-doing,</hi> and he citeth 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 17. as if it were

was direfull perſecution, and yet <hi>they totally diſclaimed perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
for conſcience,</hi> and pleaded for Toleration. So ſay I of
the <hi>Arminians in Holland,</hi> who alwayes plead for liberty of
Propheſying, and of <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and all the <hi>Sectaries</hi> in
<hi>Germany,</hi> when they firſt aroſe, of the <hi>Familiſts</hi> and moſt

Anabaptiſts, Antiſcripturiſts, Socinians, Familiſts, &amp;c.</hi> in <hi>Old
England.</hi> Yea, we may ſuppoſe all <hi>Papiſts, Iewes,</hi> and the
moſt abominable Sects, living where there are ſtrict Lawes
for the onely one true Religion, to hold the opinion of
totall <hi>diſclaiming perſecution for conſcience</hi> (for ſure they are
moſt capable of this opinion) hence it ſhall follow that all
theſe wretched Hereticks ſhall be the only true Church and
body of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. This monopolizeth the nature and name of the true
<hi>Church</hi> to onely <hi>Sectaries</hi> that profeſſe they are ready to
<hi>ſuffer for their conſcience, and doe totally diſclaime perſecution,</hi> that
is, for liberty of conſcience: ſo this opinion ſhall be the
only eſſential, not and conſtituent form of the true Church,
and ſhall exclude the ſound faith of all fundamentalls, and
the doctrine of the Law and Goſpell. The vileſt Hereticks
living, holding this one Article of <hi>Baptiſts</hi> faith, ſhall be the

            </p>
            <p>5. Forme an Argument, Mr. <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> from your two
Scriptures. If to perſecute for conſcience be eſſentiall to
ſuch as are borne of the fleſh, and to be perſecuted for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
be eſſentiall to ſuch as are born after the Spirit, then
to be thus perſecuted, and to diſclaim totally perſecution
for conſcience is an eſſentiall note of the true Church. This
Propoſition can never be proved in your ſenſe, for to <hi>be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
for conſcience;</hi> that is, for a well informed conſcience
which is ſound in the faith of Articles of ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is indeed ſuch an eſſentiall note, and ſo we yeeld all,
but it is nothing for toleration, but much againſt it, but to
be perſecuted for conſcience, though erroneous and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Judaiſme, Turciſme, Arrianiſme, Papiſme, Familiſme, &amp;c.</hi>
to be the true and ſaving way (which is the ſenſe of
<hi>Baptiſt</hi>) is no wiſe a note of ſuch <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not doth any place of Scripture by the thirteenth conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
prove the ſame; for <hi>Iſaac</hi> was not perſecuted by
<hi>Iſhmael</hi> for his erroneous conſcience. The Text ſayes no
ſuch thing, except <hi>Baptist</hi> make <hi>Iſaac</hi> an Heretick, and a
falſe Prophet: If <hi>Iſhmael</hi> perſecuted <hi>Iſaac</hi> for his conſcience
(which yet <hi>Baptiſt</hi> cannot prove from Scripture) ſure it
was not for the hereticall conſcience of <hi>Iſaac;</hi> nor will it

puniſheth not juſtly a murtherer, becauſe he ſeems in the
minde and conception of the <hi>Magistrate</hi> to be a murtherer,
but becauſe he is a murtherer, and is proved by faithfull
witneſſes to be a murtherer; ſo is the Heretick proved to be
a Heretick by the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> and ſo convicted, that he is
<hi>ſelf-condemned;</hi> for we never make the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> thoughts

<pb n="348" facs="tcp:115605:189"/>
even as we are not to avoid an Heretick after admonition,
becauſe he is an Heretick in our conception onely, for our
conception muſt not be the rule or formall ground of
caſting out any man from our ſociety, and avoiding of him;
but we avoid him becauſe he is an Heretick in himſelf:
nor exhorts <hi>Peter</hi> any man to ſuffer <hi>for well-doing;</hi> that is, for
his conſcience, or for his erroneous and hereticall conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that is but an abuſing of the word of God; for he
ſpeaks not of ſuffering directly for onely Religion true or
falſe, though he exclude it not, but ſaith, 1 Pet. 4. 15. <hi>But
let none of you ſuffer as a murtherer, as a theefe, as an ill-doer;</hi> and
in ſo ſaying, he means that no man ſhould (as <hi>Elimas</hi>) ſuffer
blindneſſe, for perverting the faith of <hi>Sergius Paulus,</hi> and I
beleeve, it will be a peece of labour for <hi>Libertines</hi> to
prove that ſuch oppoſers of the Goſpel as <hi>Elimas</hi> and <hi>Hyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus,</hi>
who ſuffered as ill-doers, did yet know in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
the Goſpel to be the onely ſaving truth and way of
God, and that againſt the warning of an illuminated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<hi>Elimas</hi> perverted the right wayes of God. However
to ſuffer here as a well, doer by <hi>Baptiſts</hi> way, is to ſuffer for
an hereticall conſcience defending and teaching lies in the
name of the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If ſo, ſuch a well-doer if blaſphemouſly
unſound, is to <hi>be thruſt through,</hi> and ſtabbed, as an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor,
by the Lords mouth, Zach. 13.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Baptiſt</hi> is ſo charitable of all Saints that are not for
liberty of conſcience, as that he makes it their doom <hi>to be
caſt out as Iſhmael, and to have</hi> no ſhare in Chriſt, or in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.
But, <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> if you judge us, and be not infallible, you
take the Lords throne upon you, and you judge us before
our day, which is to you a ſtrong argument againſt liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

            <p>The Propoſition needs no probation, That muſt be falſe

of Conſcience now under the New Teſtament is,<note place="margin">Its a falſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, None are puniſhable for hereſie becauſe hereſie is to God only know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and to no mortal man.</note> that
<hi>Hereticks and ſeducing Teachers are therefore unpuniſhable by the
ſword, becauſe they are unknowable:</hi> The formall and that which
conſtituteth an Heretick an Heretick, is in the heart, to wit,
heart-contumacie, <hi>legible and obvious only to him that knows all,

judged nor puniſhed; obſerve by the way, the Church of <hi>Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atira</hi>

are expreſſely commanded (ſay <hi>Libertines</hi>) to ſuffer the tares,
that is,<note place="margin">Goodwins <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> Theoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia.</note> Hereticks to grow till harveſt, becauſe we cannot

3. We have not that infallible Spirit, and thoſe Prophets who
cannot erre, and can infallibly tel us who is the Heretick, who
not. 4. There is a great variety, and ſuch contrarietie of
judging (ſay they) what is hereſie, what not, that what is he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie

be beleeved as he; <hi>Ergo,</hi> We are all in the miſt, and in a ſea
of uncertainties in judging who is the Heretick, who the
Saint. 5. Hereſie is innocencie; <hi>Ergo,</hi> there is no ſuch fault
reproveable or puniſhable in the world, ſay they. But this
principle that the Seducer is not knowable in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is moſt falſe and contrary to Scripture.</p>
            <p>1. He whom the Holy Ghoſt bids as try, and not beleeve,
till we try,<note place="margin">The Heretick is knowable by the Scriptures.</note> he is knowable, but every teacher true or falſe, the
Holy Ghoſt bids us try, 1 <hi>Theſ. 5. 21. 1 Joh.</hi> 4. 1. and for
this are the <hi>Bercans</hi> commended, becauſe they tryed <hi>Paul</hi> and
his doctrine by the Scriptures, <hi>Acts 17. 11. Ergo,</hi> If <hi>Paul</hi> had
been an Heretick and a falſe Teacher, he might have been
found out.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="354" facs="tcp:115605:193"/>
2. Such an one as the Lord forewarns us to beware of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and avoid, ſuch an one is knowable. But the Lord bids us
beware of falſe Prophets and Seducers, and bids us avoid
them and beleeve them not, Matth. 7. 15. <hi>Remore of falſe
Prophets,</hi> Marth. 24. 23. <hi>If any man ſay to you, loe here is Chriſt,
or loe there, beleeve it not:</hi> why if he teach me where Chriſt is,
if I heare not him, I refuſe to hear Chriſt, Matth. 10. 40, 41.
<hi>Ergo</hi> the falſe Chriſt is knowable, Tit. 2. 10. <hi>An hereticke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void,

muſt we ſay, there is not ſuch a man knowable to a mortall
man as a falſe Prophet, or an heretick; and therefore <hi>Paul</hi>
doth but mocke the <hi>Philippians,</hi> who were not infallible,
when he writeth to them thus, <hi>Beware of dogs;</hi> and <hi>John</hi>
when he ſaith, <hi>If any man bring not this doctrine, receive him
not into your houſe.</hi> Might not <hi>Libertines</hi> ſay, God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
us to run the hazard of incroaching upon Gods
chaire, for who but he who knows the heart can tell who is
the heretick, who not: when the Lord rebukes aſſociation
with Theeves, Robbers, Slanderers, Prov. 1. 11, 12. Pſ. 15. 18,
holdeth he not forth that the Theif, the Robber, and
the Slanderer are knowable?</p>
            <p>3. Theſe whom the Lord rebukes, becauſe they judge
not <hi>Jezabel</hi> and deceiving teachers, may know <hi>Jezabel</hi> and
deceiving teachers; but the Lord rebukes the Church of
<hi>Thyatira</hi> for this, Revel. 2. 20. and all other Churches in
them.</p>
            <p>4. Thoſe that faithfull Elders are to beware of, and to
watch againſt, are knowable; but the faithfull Elders of
<hi>Epheſus</hi> are to watch againſt the incomming of grievous
wolves, Act. 20. 29, 30, 31.</p>
            <p>5. Thoſe that the Holy Ghoſt doth forewarn the Saints

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Sword produceth no repentance at all,

as to the adequate and proper object of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God; the Magiſtrate indeed forbiddeth ſpeaking
of blaſphemy, and teaching of lyes in the name of the
Lord; but he forbiddeth not teaching of lyes, or abſtinence
from blaſpheming in a ſpirituall, but in a carnall co-active
by force of the ſword, and externall way, becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
puniſh the ſpirituall and internall wayes, and manner
of externall obedience, and therefore he cannot under
paine of bodily cenſure, command and forbid theſe wayes
of obedience, ſo the Magiſtrate forbiddeth murther, but
God, not the Magiſtrate forbiddeth murther, or comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
abſtinence from killing, out of mercy and love to our
neighbour; for the Magiſtrate cannot puniſh heart-hatred
of our neighbour, or raſh anger, but in ſo far as it comes
out to his ſenſes, in ſtriking, maiming, or opprobrious
ſpeeches; and theſe he can forbid, and cenſure and puniſh.
So we ſay the Magiſtrate is but a peece, or a bit of an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
(though both lawfull and neceſſary, Rom. 13. for
our good) to reform the outſide, &amp; to work outward refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
and when he commandeth the outward man, and
ſaith, <hi>Sweare not, blaſpheme not, ſpeake not lies in the name of the
Lord, kill not, ſteale not under the paine of feeling the ſtroke of the
Sword:</hi> he commands not ſinning, for though he forbid
onely externall abſtinence from ſins that troubles the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man, without any ſpirituall and internall right way
of abſtaining, he commands not ſin and hypocriſie, <hi>perſe,</hi>

            <p>1. Becauſe the Magiſtrate, as the Magiſtrate ſhould, and
ought, as <hi>the Miniſter of God,</hi> give commandements to the
outward man, under paine of corporall puniſhment, not to
the ſoule, or to the inward man.</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe that externall obedience, not to kill, not to
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:115605:194"/>
ſteale, not to ſpeake lies, is good, lawfull externall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
to man, and profitable in the State, for the end that
God hath appointed it, which is the peaceable converſing
one with another, that ſame abſtinence from killing in an
unrenewed man, who abſtaineth not from killing for fear
of God, and love to his brethren, is a ſinfull abſtinence,
and carnall repentance,<note place="margin">How the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law of God; to wit, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence onely to externall peace and the halfe and outſide of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and yet not hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>call in its kind.</note> by accident, and in relation to the

compleat and intire, and full, and ſincere. Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
obedience, which the Magiſtrate commandeth,
is good and lawfull, and neceſſary obedience, and is, in the

full, and ſincere; which is required from the whole man,
in order to the Law of God. Then the outward obedience
that the Magiſtrate demandeth is not compleat, intire, nor
ſincere, but in relation to the <hi>Law of God,</hi> which requireth

is not full, not intire, not ſincere obedience, but an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide

though the Magiſtrate command to preach ſound doctrine,

yet the juridical interpretation of the Church is to men a
ground of faith, and that is the ground of faith which the
Church giveth, as the only true ſenſe of Scripture.</p>
            <p>The Aſſumption is clear, becauſe <hi>Libertines</hi> ſuppoſe that
the ſenſe of Scripture can be undeniably known to none:
what is to one ſaint a ground of faith, the juſt contradicent to
another is a ground of faith, and what ſenſe to one Saint is an
Article of ſaving faith, to another is a damnable Hereſie; and
both are to be tolerated, neither corrected nor puniſhed,
for ſince neither are infallible, neither can deſerve rebukes or

natural, and whatſoever ſenſe the word offers to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
true or falſe, the man cannot be guilty in receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

may miſtake, yet when they have brought the Husband to the
wife, it cannot follow that the Wife doth not certainly and
as infallibly know her own Husband by his tongue, voice,
countenance, proportion of body and ſtatute, as one can know
another without any danger of miſtake: ſo it comes to the
eares of a man born blind, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. there is a Prophet called
<hi>Ieſus the Son of Marie,</hi> who will infallibly and indeclinably
reſtore ſight to this blind man, yet the fame and report by
which this is carried to the mans notice and knowledge is
fallible, all men ſtanding truly, that which the Lord report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

to him: Now in the carrying of the doctrine of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Apoſtles to our knowledge, through Printers, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators,
grammer, pens, and tongues of men from ſo many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
all which are fallible, we are to look to an unerring and
undeclinable providence, conveying the Teſtament of Chriſt,
which in it ſelf is infallible and begs no truth, no authoritie
either from the Church as Papiſts dreame, or from Grammer,
Characters, Printer, or tranſlator, all theſe being adventitious,

and when Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> reſolves all our faith into a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

might, in that, appealed to a lying Judge, and a corrupt

8. Yea and ſo, what God ſpake immediately to <hi>Abraham,

ſpake to them in a language intelligible, they had no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of faith, that the words that came from God, did
ſignifie thus and thus; for ſure, God, by immediate inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
taught them not Grammar, and ſignifications of
words, and thoſe that read the Law written by Gods finger
on two Tables of ſtone, thoſe who heard <hi>Moſes</hi> and the

who read the originall firſt Hebrew copy of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the

word of God, but the authority of Father, Mother, and
Nurſes, who firſt taught them their Mother-tongue, for
ſure the Prophets were not <hi>School-maſters</hi> to teach them
<hi>Hebrew;</hi> ſo by this learning there was never ſince the world

faith is periſhed out of the earth: nay there never could be

            <p>2. The ſimple apprehenſion of God to be a fourfooted

by this learning of Libertines there can be no ſin
in ſimple apprehenſions of God, though moſt prodigious,
and monſtrous, what is blaſphemy, is as controverted and

the formall of it is within, in the heart.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>If matters of fact be puniſhable according to their proportion and
malignancy, then ſpeaking lyes in the name of the Lord,</hi> and teaching

and to teach any thing contrary to what God hath

            <p>4. Can a man be the leſſe hereticall, and his ſociety the

doctrine? for thoughts cannot change the nature of
actions.</p>
            <p>5. To kill a man is indifferent of it ſelf, it may be done in
juſtice, it may be done in injuſtice, but if a man kill his ſon,
and offer him to God,<note place="margin">For the Father to kill the ſon, upon a meer religious ground, is no murther, nor puniſhable by Libertines way</note> neither hating, nor envying, nor

that he expreſſeth an act of love to God, above that he

            <p>For 1. It may be ſaid by <hi>Libertines,</hi> the act of killing is

            <p>2. If he hate not his ſon, and lye not in wait for him,
it is no murther, Deut. 4. 42. Deut. 19. 46. <hi>He is not worthy
of death, for as much as he hated him not in times paſt.</hi> Nor can
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:115605:207"/>
killing be called a vertuall hating, or eſſentially an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of our brother, for then it were impoſſible for a
Judge to kill a man, and not to hate him: As every breach
of the Law of God is eſſentially an hatred of God, and
a vertuall hatred of God: for ſimple killing of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
is not murther by Gods reaſoning, but killing of him
in hatred, rage, anger, or deſire of revenge. Nor can it be
ſaid, that hating, forbidden in murther, by the Law of
God, includes a loving of him, and a ſaving of his life; when
it is in our power to ſave it, as it is in the fathers power,
who ſacrificeth his innocent Son to God, to ſave his life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> I deny not but it is murther, for they
teach, that a man may publiſh that which by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
deſtroyeth the faith of fundamentals, and ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the faith of others, which to do is a ſin, but becauſe
the man followeth the dictment of his erroneous conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
it is no ſin to the man that ſo teacheth, yea, he may
innocently ſuffer perſecution for his conſcience, thus erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous,
yea, and dye a martyr for it. <hi>Ergo,</hi> if the following
of an erroneous conſcience, ſhall make a leſſe ſin to be no
ſin but innocency, it ſhall make a greater ſin, to wit, kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his ſon to his heavenly father, no ſin, and ſo he may
lawfully do it. Nor wil it ſuffice to ſay, to offer a man to God
and kill him, is againſt the light of nature, and vincibly a
ſin; what then? if the man beleeve he is commanded to kill
him, his erroneous conſcience muſt bind, as the offering of
whole burnt offerings to God, to us is a ſin, againſt the light
of nature, in regard the law of nature can no more warrant
it, then it can warrant Chriſt to offer up himſelf to God. But
upon the ſuppoſition of <hi>Libertines,</hi> it's no murther, nor is it pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable
at al, becauſe the father may, yea, &amp; lawfully ought
to worſhip God according to the indictment of his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
whither the conſcience be right, or bloody and errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and yet he is not puniſhable for blood-ſhed, by their way
for meerly, and ſimply, without any malignancy or hatred
to the child; he beleeves, he ought to preferre his maker,
to his deareſt childs life as well as <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
doth naturally, and as under no Law, ſimply beleeve
it is the like ſervice, and worſhip that <hi>Abraham</hi> would have
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:115605:208"/>
gratefully performed unto God, if God in reward of that
love, had not forbidden him againe to kill his Sonne.
And this anſwer preſuppoſes alſo, that it is impoſſible for
a father to have ſuch a conſcience, as may ſtimulate, and
command to kill his ſon, and that in the authority, and
name of God, as he erroneouſly, yea, and as he invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
holdeth, as <hi>Socinians, Familiſts, Papiſts,</hi> beleeve pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,
merits, juſtification by workes, who yet are not
to be puniſhed for their conſcience, according to <hi>Libertines.</hi>
Again, there is no intrinſecall malignancy in the act of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or ſon-ſacrificing, but what it hath from the Lords
Law forbiding to kill, now thoſe that killed their Sons to

beleeved God commanded them, to do him ſuch

that this is invincible ignorance, (I take the word invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the <hi>Libertines</hi> ſenſe) <hi>Libertines</hi> grant, for in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
ſon-ſacrificing, they wil ſay we are not infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Yea, <hi>the underſtanding, being ſpirituall, cannot be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>

as times blow faire or foule, through the corruption of

punitive power, that God hath given to the Chriſtian Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,

Kings whoſe breaſts the Church ſhould ſucke, often doe

then, Sophiſts may bring a caption, <hi>ab accidente,</hi> againſt

Religion, which he judgeth in his conſcience, to be a falſe,
ſuperſtitious, and Idolatrous way; for this containes many
uncertainties and lyes: For death was to be inflicted, not
on thoſe onely that ſinned againſt the Law of Nature, but
2 Chron. 15. 13. <hi>Whoſoever would not ſeeke the Lord God of Iſrael,
was put to death, ſmall or great, man or woman;</hi> now <hi>the ſeeking of
the Lord God of Iſrael,</hi> was to ſerve him, according to the rule
revealed, in the ſupernaturall, ſpirituall and holy Law of
God contained in <hi>Moſes</hi> his Books. This I judge was ſome
higher, then the Law of Nature. 2. Let us put <hi>Libertines</hi> to
make this good, that thoſe who ſaid, the <hi>golden calves, were
the gods that brought them out of Egypt,</hi> and adored them, and
were therefore put to death, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. (ſince our Divines
prove from the place, that they made thoſe Calves memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
objects of <hi>Jehovah</hi> onely) did that againſt the light of
their conſcience, and the manifeſt Law of Nature. What if
God had made Calves and Bullocks to repreſent God, as

lyes? if both may fall in the ſame hereſie with the like per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacy
for a time, if we be not reſpecters of perſons, they no
leſſe deſerve both to be puniſhed, then when both commit
adultery and murther. 2. Why lying of God and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
words that eat like a gangrene, and beleeving a lye
deſerveth rather an indulgence in a Saint, then murthering,
whoring, oppreſſing. And why, but we may tolerate all
the Saints, becauſe they are Saints, as well as ſome ſinne no
leſſe, yea more dangerous, then theſe that are not to be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated,
for to infect the flocke with lying doctrine is more
hurtfull to the Church, then the example of adultery or
murther in a Saint, if toleration of all wayes, and liberty of
profeſſing or publiſhing whatever tenets <hi>or doctrines ſeem good

kind of lies, againſt God, his Son Chriſt, heaven, hell, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
the laſt judgement, the immortalitie of the ſoul,
though moſt pernicious to ſoules; for God commandeth all
meanes of finding out truth, for it cannot be ſaid he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
all lawfull meanes, for Libertines hold that to profeſſe
and publiſh what the moſt erroneous conſcience dictates to
be the truth of God, though it be black hereſie, is to ſpeak the
truth as an Indweller in the Lords holy hill, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. ſo ſaith
<hi>Vaticanus</hi> and all the Libertines who make the conſcience
right or erroneous, the rule of the Chriſtian mans walking,
not the word of God, and in ſo doing the Lord muſt by the
Libertines doctrine command men to ſpeak <hi>lies in the Name of
the Lord,</hi> and muſt command Hereticks and Saints <hi>to pervert
the ſoules</hi> and the <hi>faith</hi> of one another, and make one another
<hi>children of perdition,</hi> and <hi>not ſpare the flock,</hi> but devour and
hunt ſoules, and ſo ſhall the Lord command ſinne. 6. How

<hi>of the truth, and a meaſuring of it out at the pleaſure of men,</hi> in

receiveth me,</hi> Joh. 13. 20. <hi>and</hi> Luke 10. 16. <hi>He that heareth you
heareth me, and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me, and he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth

Whoſoever ſhall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
out of the houſe or Citie, ſhake off the duſt off your feet. Verily
I ſay unto you, it ſhall be eaſier for the land of Sodom and Gemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah
in the day of judgement then for that Citie:</hi> Which words are
ſpoken of all the faithfull Miniſters of Chriſt to the end of
the world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. ſo they ſpeak according to the
commiſſion given them by the Lord ſpeaking in his word,
whether they declare the mind of Chriſt in a pulpit or Synod.
This way Miniſters who hear the Word at Gods mouth, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek.</hi>
3. 10. and deliver the whole councell of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 27.
and keep nothing back as faithful Ambaſſadors and Stewards

3. Suppoſe <hi>Sectaries</hi> could teach the Miniſters
of the Aſſemblie, as well as the Miniſters can teach them, yet
is there more reaſon that Miniſters ſhould Synodically teach
then they; for a teaching Miniſtery is an ordinance of Chriſt
in the New Teſtament, as is clear by theſe places which hold
forth that Chriſt is preſent with his faithfull Miniſters to the
<hi>end of the world, Joh. 20. 21, 22. Matth. 28. 19. Eph.</hi> 4. 11, 12,
