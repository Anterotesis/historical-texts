            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Mr. Speaker,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHosoever desires this totall change of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Government, desires it either out of a conceit that is <hi>unlawfull,</hi> or <hi>inconvenient.</hi> To both these, I shall say something. To the first, being able to make no such argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove it so my self, as I conceive likely to be made within the walls of so wise a House, I can make no answer to them, till I hear them from some other; which then (if they perswade me not) by the liberty of a Committee, I shall do. But this in generall. In the mean time, I shall say, that the ground of this government of Episcopacy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so <hi>ancient,</hi> and so <hi>generall,</hi> so <hi>uncontradicted</hi> in the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>best</hi> times, that our most laborious Antiquaries can find no <hi>Nation,</hi> no <hi>City,</hi> no <hi>Church,</hi> nor <hi>Houses</hi> under any other; that our first Ecclesiasticall Authors tell us, that the <hi>Apostles</hi> not onely allow'd but <hi>founded</hi> Bishops (so that the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54903:3"/>
tradition for <hi>some</hi> Books of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which we receive as Canonicall, is both lesse ancient, lesse generall, and lesse uncontradicted,) I must ask leave to say, that though the Mysterie of iniquity began suddenly to work, yet it did not instantly prevail; it could not ayme at the end of the race, as soon as it was started; nor could Antichristianism in so short a time have become so Catholique.</p>
            <p>To the second, this I say, that in this Government there is no <hi>inconvenience</hi> which might not be sufficiently remedied without destroying the whole; and though we had not par'd their Nails, or rather their Tongues, (I mean the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Commission,) though we should neither give them the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of strict rules, nor the addition of choyce Assisters (both which we may do, and suddenly I hope we shall;) yet the fear sunk into them of this Parliament, and the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Trienniall one, would be such banks to these ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that we need fear their inundations no more.</p>
            <p>Next I say, that if some inconvenience did appear in this, yet since it may also appear, that the change will breed greater, I desire those who are led to change by <hi>inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> onely, that they will suspend their opinions, till they see what is to be laid in the other ballance, which I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour.</p>
            <p>The inconveniences of the change are double, some that it should be yet done, others, that it should be at all done. The first again, double, 1. Because we have not done what we should do first; and 2. Because others have not done what they should do first; That which <hi>we</hi> should do first, is, to agree of a succeeding Form of Government, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, when he gives his Vote to the destruction of this, may be sure that he destroys not that, which he likes better than that which shall succeed it. I conceive no man will at this time give this Vote, who doth not believe this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be the worst that can possibly be devised; and for mypart, if this be thus proposterously done, and we left in this blind uncertainty (what shall become of us!) I shall not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54903:3"/>
onely doubt all the inconveniences, which any Government ment <hi>hath,</hi> but which any Government <hi>may</hi> have. This I insist on the rather, because if we should find cause to wish for this back again, we could not have it, the means being disperst. To restore it again would be a miracle in State, like that of the resurrection to Nature.</p>
            <p>That which <hi>others</hi> should do first, is, to be gone. For if you will do this, yet things standing as they do, no great cause appearing for so great a change, I fear a great <hi>Army</hi> may be thought to be the <hi>cause.</hi> And I therefore desire (to be sure that <hi>Newcastle</hi> may not be suspected to have any influence upon <hi>London,</hi>) that this may not be done, till our Brethren be returned to their Patrimony.</p>
            <p>We are now past the inconveniences in poynt of Time; I now proceed. And my first inconvenience of this change, is, the inconvenience of change it self, which is so great an inconvenience, when the Change is great and suddain, that in such cases, when it is not <hi>necessary</hi> to change, it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>not</hi> to change. To a person formerly intemperate, I have known the first prescription of an excellent Physitian, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear <hi>too good</hi> a diet for a good while. We have lived long happily, and gloriously, under this Form of Government; Episcopacy hath very well agreed with the constitution of our Laws, with the disposition of our People: how any other will do, I the lesse know, because I know not of any other, of which so much as <hi>any</hi> other <hi>Monarchy</hi> hath had any experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; they <hi>all</hi> having (as I conceive) at least Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents for <hi>life:</hi> and the meer <hi>word</hi> Bishop, I suppose, is no man's aime to destroy, nor no man's aim to defend.</p>
            <p>Next, Sir, I am of opinion, that <hi>most</hi> men <hi>desire</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">See the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions <hi>for</hi> Episcopacy; printed for <hi>Will. Shears.</hi>
               </note> not this change, or else I am certain there hath been very sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly a great change in men. Severall Petitions indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire it, but knowing how concern'd and how united that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is, how few would be wanting to so good a work, even those hands which value their number to others, are an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54903:4"/>
of their paucity to me. The numberlesse number of those of a different sense, appear not so publiquekly and cry not so loud, being persons more quiet, as secure in the goodnesse of their Lawes, and the wisdom of their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers; And because men petition for what they have not, and not for what they have, perhaps that the Bishops may not know how many friends their Order hath, lest they be incouraged to abuse their authority, if they knew it to be so generally approved. Now, Sir, though we are trusted by those that sent us, in cases wherein their opinions were unknown; yet truly if I knew the opinion of the major part of my Town, I doubt whether it were the intention of those that trusted me, that I should follow my own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion against theirs. <q rend="margQuotes">At least, let us stay till the next Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and consult more particularly with them about it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Next, Sir, it will be the destruction of many estates, in which many, who <hi>may be</hi> very innocent persons, are legally vested, and of many persons who undoubtedly are innocent, whose dependances are upon those estates. The Apostle faith, <hi>he that provides not for his family, is worse then an Infidel,</hi> This belongs in some analogy to us; and truly, Sir, we provide ill for our Family (the Common-wealth) if we suffer a considerable part of it to be turned out of doors. So that, for any care is taken by this Bill for new dwelling, (and I will never consent they shall play an after-game, for all they have) either we must see them starve in the streets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, or (to avoid that) we must ship them some-whither away, like the <hi>Moors</hi> out of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the hurt of the <hi>Learned</hi> I come to that of <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> and desire you to consider, whether, when all conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable maintenance shall be reduced to cure of Souls, all studies, will not be reduced to those which are in order to <hi>Preaching;</hi> the <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Languages,</hi> and even eminent skill in <hi>Controversies</hi> (to which great leasure and great means is required) much neglected, and (to the joy and gain of our common Adversary,) <hi>Syntagms, Postills, Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisms,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:54903:4"/>
               <hi>Commentators,</hi> and <hi>Concordances,</hi> almost onely bought, and the rest of <hi>Libraries</hi> remain rather as of orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then as of use. I do not deny but for all this want, the wit of some hath attempted both, and the parts of some few have served to discharge both, as those of <hi>Calvin,</hi> to advise about, and dispatch more Temporall businesse into the bargain, than all our Privy-Councell; yet such abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are extreamly rare, and very few will ever <hi>p each mice a Sunday, and be any match for</hi> Bellarmine. Nay I fear, Sir, that this will make us to have fewer able even in <hi>Preaching</hi> it self, as it is separated from generall Learning, for I fear <hi>many whose parts, friends, and means, might make them hope for better advancements in other courses, when these shall be taken away from this, will be less ready to imbrace it;</hi> and though it were to be wisht, that all men should onely undertake those Embassages, with reference to His Honour Whose Embassadors they are; yet I doubt not but many, who have entred into the Church by the Door, (or rather by the Window,) have done it (after) great and sincere service; and better reasons have made them <hi>labour</hi> in the vineyard, than <hi>brought</hi> them thither at first: and though the meer love of God ought to make us good, though there were no reward or punishment, yet it would be very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to piety, that <hi>hope</hi> of Heaven and <hi>fear</hi> of Hell were taken away.</p>
            <p>The next inconvenience, I fear, is this; that if we should take away a Government which hath as much testimony of the <hi>first</hi> antiquity to have been <hi>founded</hi> by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> as can be brought for some parts of <hi>Scripture</hi> to have been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by them, lest this may avert some of <hi>our</hi> Church from us, and rivet some of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to her; and (as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) the Apostle commands us to be carefull, <hi>not to give scandall even to those that are without.</hi> Sir, It hath been said, that we have a better way to know Scripture than by Tradition; I dispute not this, Sir, but I know that Tradition is the onely argument to prove Scripture to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54903:5"/>
another, and the first to every mans self, being compared to the Samaritan Woman's report, which made many first believe in Christ, though they after believed him for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. And I therefore would not have this so far weakned to us, as to take away Episcopacy as unlawfull, which is so far by Tradition proved to be lawfull.</p>
            <p>The next inconvenience that I fear, is this: having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served those generally who are against Bishops (I will not now speak of such as are among us, who by being sele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the rest, are to be hoped to be freer then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, from vulgar passions) to have somewhat more ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosity against those who are for them, then <hi>vice versâ;</hi> lest when they shall have prevaild against the Bishops, they be so far encouraged against their partakers, and will so have discouraged their adversaries, as in time to induce a <hi>necessity</hi> upon others, at least of the Clergy, to believe them as unlawfull as they themselves do, and to assent to other of their opinions yet <hi>left at large.</hi> Which will be a way to deprive us, I think, of not our worst, I am sure of our most learned Ministers; and to send a greater Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonie to <hi>New England,</hi> then it hath been said this Bill will recall from thence.</p>
            <p>I come now from the incoveniences of taking away this Government, to the <hi>inconveniences of that which shall suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed it:</hi> and to this I can speak but by guesse, and groping, because I have no light given me what that shall be; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I hope I shall be excused for shooting at random, since you will set me up no Butt to shoot at. The first, I fear the <hi>Scotch Government</hi> will either presently be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; or if any other succeed for a while, yet the unity and industry of those of that opinion in this Nation, assisted by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nsell and friendship of that, will shortly bring it in, if any lesse opposite Government to it be here placed than that of Episcopacy. And indeed Sir, since any other Government than theirs will by no means give any satisfaction to their desire of uniformity; since all they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54903:5"/>
who see not the dishonour and ill consequences of it, will be unwilling to deny their Brethren what they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem indifferent; since our own Government being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, we shall in all I kelyhood be aptest to receive that which is both next at hand and ready made: For these reasons I look upon it as probable; and for the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ones, as inconvenient.</p>
            <p>When some Bishops pretended to <hi>Jure divino</hi> (though nothing so likely to be believed by the People, as those would be, nor consequently to hurt us by that pretence) this was cry'd out upon as destructive to His Majestie's Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, who was to be confessed to be the Fountain of Jurisdiction in this Kingdom. Yet to <hi>Jure divino</hi> the <hi>Scotch</hi> Ecclesiasticall government pretends, To meet when they please, to treat of what they please, to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate whom they please, even Parliaments themselves; so far are they from receiving either rules or punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from them. And for us to bring in any <hi>unlimited,</hi> any <hi>Independent</hi> authority, the first is against the Liberty of the Subject, the second against the Right and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of Parliament; and both against the Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>If it be said, that this <hi>unlimitednesse</hi> and <hi>independence</hi> is onely in Spirituall things; I answer first, that arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Government being the worst of Governments, and our <hi>Bodies</hi> being worse than our <hi>Souls,</hi> it will be strange to set up that over the second, of which we were so impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient over the first. Secondly, that M. <hi>Sollicitor</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the Power of the Clergy, to make Canons to bind, did excellently inform us, what a mighty influence Spiritual power hath upon Temporal affairs. So that if our Clergy had the one, they had inclusively almost all the other. And to this I may adde, (what all men may see,) the vast Temporall power of the Pope allow'd him by such who allow it him onely <hi>in ordine ad Spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia:</hi> for the Fable will tell you, if you make the Lyon
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54903:6"/>
(and the Clergy, assisted by the people, is Lyon enough) it was a wise fear of the Foxe's, lest he might call a knubb a horn. And sure, Sir, they will in this case be Judges, not onely of that which is Spiritual, but of what it is that is so: and the people receiving instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from no other, will take the most Temporal matter to be Spiritual, if they tell them it is so.</p>

            <p>SECT. 1. IF we abstract from <hi>Episcopal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> all accidentals, and consider onely what is essential and necessary to it; we shall find in it no more but this. An appointment of one man of eminent sanctity and sufficiency to have the care of all the Churches, within a certain Precinct or Diocesse; and furnishing him with authority (not absolute or arbitrary, but regulated and bounded by Laws, and moderated by joyning to him a convenient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of assistants) to the intent that all the Churches under him may be provided of good and able Pastors: and that both of Pastours and people, conformity to Laws, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of their duties may be required, under penalties, not left to discretion, but by Law appointed.</p>
            <p>SECT. 2. To this kind of Government I am not by any particular interest so devoted, as to think it ought to be maintained, either in opposition to Apostolick Institution; or to the much desired reformation of mens lives, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration of Primitive discipline; or to any Law or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ: for that were to maintain a means contrary to the end; for obedience to our Saviour, is the end for which Church-Government is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54903:7"/>
But if it may be <hi>demonstrated</hi> (or made much more probable than the contrary) as I verily think it may: I. That it is not repugnant to the government setled in and for the Church by the Apostles. II. That it is as complyable with the reformation of any evill which we desire to reform either in Church or State, or the introduction of any good. which we desire to introduce, as any other kind of Government: And III. That there is <hi>no</hi> Law, <hi>no</hi> Record of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our against it: then I hope it will not be thought an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable motion, if we humbly desire those that are in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, especially the High Court of Parliament, that in may not be sacrificed to clamour, or over-borne by violence: and though (which God forbid) the greater part of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude should cry, <hi>Crucifie, Crucifie;</hi> yet our Governours would be so full of Justice and courage, as not to give it up, untill they perfectly understand concerning Episcopacy it self, <hi>Quid mali fecit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SECT. 3. I shall speak at this time onely of the first of these three points: That Episcopacy is not repugnant to the government setled in the Church for perpetuity by the Apostles. Whereof I conceive this which follows is as clear a demonstration, as any thing of this nature is capable of.</p>
            <p>That this Government was received universally in the Church, either in the Apostles time, or presently after, is so evident and unquestionable, that the most learned adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries of this Government do themselves confesse it.</p>
            <p>SECT. 4. <hi>Petrus Molinaeus</hi> in his Book <hi>De munere pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rali,</hi> purposely written in defence of the Presbyterial-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, acknowledgeth: That presently after the Apostles times, or even in their time (as Ecclesiastical story witness<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) it was ordained, That in every City one of the presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery should be called a Bishop, who should have per-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence over his Colleagues; to avoid confusion which oft times ariseth out of equality. And truely, this form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment all Chuches every where received.</p>

               <hi>Episcopatus genere,</hi> confesseth in effect the same thing. For having distinguished Episcopacy into three kinds, <hi>Divine, Humane,</hi> and <hi>Satanical,</hi> and attributing to the second (which he calls <hi>Humane,</hi> but we maintain and conceive to be <hi>Apostolical</hi>) not onely a priority of order, but a superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of power, and authority over other Presbyters, boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded yet by Laws and Canons provided against Tyranny: he clearely professeth that of this kind of Episcopacy, is to be understood whatsoever we read concerning the authority of Bishops (or Presidents, as <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> callsthem) in <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi> and other more ancient Writers.</p>
            <p>SECT. 6. Certainly from <note n="*" place="margin">To whom two others also from <hi>Geneva</hi> may be added: <hi>Daniel Chami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erus</hi> (in Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratia, tom. 2. lib. 10. cap. 6. §. 24.) and <hi>Nicol. Vedelius</hi> (Exercitat. 3. in epist. Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tii ad Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delph. cap. 14. &amp; Exercit. 8. in epist. ad Mariam, cap. 3.) which is fully also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstated in D. <hi>Hammonds dissertations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Blondel</hi> (which never <hi>were</hi> answerd, &amp; never <hi>will</hi>) by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of those who wrote in the very next Age after the Apo stles.</note> these two great defenders of the Presbytery, we should never have had this free acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, (so prejudicial to their own pretence, and so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to their adversaries purpose) had not the evidence of clear and undeniable truth enforced them to it. It will not therefore be necessary, to spend any time in confuting that uningenuous assertion of the anonymous Author of the Catalogue of Testimonies, for the equality of Bishops and Presbyters, who affirms, That their disparity began long after the Apostles times: But we may safely take for granted that which these two learned Adversaries have confessed; and see, whether upon this foundation layd by them, we may not by unanswerable reason raise this superstructure;</p>
            <q>
               <p>That seeing Episcopal Government is confessedly so An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and so Catholique, it cannot with reason be denyed  to be Apostolique.</p>
            </q>
            <p>SECT. 7. For so great a change, as between Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Government and Episcopal, could not possibly have prevailed all the world over in a little time. Had Episcopal Government been an aberration from (or a corruption of) the Government left in the Churches by the Apostles, it had been very strange, that it should have been received in any <hi>one</hi> Church so suddainly, or that it should have prevailed in <hi>all</hi> for many Ages after. <hi>Variâsse debuer at error Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum: quod autem apud omnes unum est, non est erratum,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54903:8"/>
                  <hi>sed traditum.</hi> Had the Churches err'd, they would have va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried: What therefore is one and the same amongst all, came not sure by error, but tradition.</hi> Thus <hi>Tertullian</hi> argues very probably, from the consent of the Churches of his time, not long after the Apostles, and that in matter of opinion much more subject to unobserv'd alteration. But that in the frame and substance of the necessary Government of the Church, a thing alwayes in use and practice, there should be so suddain a change as presently after the Apostles times; and so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal, as received in all the Churches; this is clearly <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SECT. 8. For what universal cause can be assigned or faigned of this <hi>universal</hi> Apostasie? you will not imagine that the Apostles, all or any of them, made any decree for this change, when they were living; or left order for it in any Will or Testament, when they were dying. This were to grant the question; To wit, that the Apostles, being to leave the Government of the Churches themselves, and either seeing by experience, or fore-seeing by the Spirit of God, the distractions and disorders, which would arise from a multitude of equals, substituted Episcopal Government instead of their own. General Councells to make a Law for a generall change, for many ages there was none. There was no Christian Emperour, no coercive power over the Church to enforce it. Or if there had been any, we know no force was equal to the courage of the Christians of those times. Their lives were then at command (for they had not <hi>then</hi> learnt to <hi>fight</hi> for Christ) but their obedience to any thing <hi>against</hi> his Law was not to be commanded (for they had perfectly learn't to <hi>dye</hi> for him.) Therefore there was no power then to command this change; or if there had been any, it had been in vain.</p>
            <p>SECT. 9. What device then shall we study, or to what fountain shall we reduce this strange pretended alteration? Can it enter into our hearts to think, that all the Presbyters and other Christians then, being the Apostles Schollers,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54903:8"/>
could be generally ignorant of the Will of Christ, touching the necessity of a Presbyterial Government? Or, dare we adventure to think them so strangely wicked all the World over, as against knowledge and conscience to conspire against it? Imagine the spirit of <hi>Diotrephes</hi> had entered into some, or a great many of the Presbyters, and possessed them with an ambitious desire of a forbiddden superiority, was it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible they should attempt and atchieve it once without any opposition or contradiction? and besides that, the contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this ambition, should spread it self and prevail with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out stop or controul, nay, without any noyse or notice taken of it, through all the Churches in the World; all the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the mean time being so fast asleep, and all the dogs so dumb, that not so much as one should open his mouth against it?</p>
            <p>SECT. 10. But let us suppose (though it be a horrible untruth) that the Presbyters and people <hi>then,</hi> were not so good <hi>Christians</hi> as the Presbyterians are <hi>now;</hi> that they were generally so negligent to retain the government of Christ's Church commanded by Christ, which we now are so zealous to restore: yet certainly we must not forget nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that they were <hi>men</hi> as we are. And if we look upon them but as meer naturall men, yet knowing by experience how hard a thing it is, even for policy arm'd with power by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny attempts and contrivances, and in a long time, to gain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the liberty of any <hi>one</hi> people; undoubtedly we shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver entertain so wild an imagination, as that among all the Christian Presbyteries in the World, neither conscience of duty, nor love of liberty, nor aversenesse from pride and usurpation of others over them, should prevail so much with any one, as to oppose this pretended universal invasion of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, and the liberty of Christians.</p>
            <p>SECT. 11. When I shall see therefore all the Fables in the <hi>Metamorphosis</hi> acted and prove stories; when I shall see all the Democracies and Aristocracies in the World lye down and sleep, and awake into Monarchies: then will I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54903:9"/>
to believe that Presbyterial Government, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Church during the Apostles times, should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after (against the Apostles doctrine and the will of Christ) be whirl'dabout like a scene in a masque, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into Episcopacy. In the mean time, while these things remain thus incredible, and in humane reason impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible; I hope I shall have leave to conclude thus:</p>
            <p>Episcopal Government is acknowledged to have been uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally received in the Church, presently after the Apostles times.</p>
            <p>Between the Apostles times and this presently after, there was not time enough for, nor possibility of, so great an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>And therefore there was no such alteration as is pretended. And therefore Episcopacy, being confessed to be so Ancient and Catholique, must be granted also to be Apostolique, <hi>Quod erat demonstrandum.</hi>

            <head>The Preface to the READER.</head>
            <p>THe eminent abilities in the most noble Author of the ensuing learned Discourse, and learneder Reply, can scarcely be imagined unknown to any whom this language can reach: But if any such there be, I shall desire them to learne the perfections of that most excellent Person, rather from the Dedication, then this <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face;</hi> the designe of which, is onely to give the <hi>Reader</hi> some satisfaction concerning the nature of this Controversie in it selfe, and of these Disserta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in particular.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romish</hi> Doctrine of their owne Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, as it is the most generall Controversie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, and all other Churches excluded by them from their Communion: So it is of such a comprehensive nature, that being proved and
<pb facs="tcp:54903:10"/>
clearely demonstrated, it would without question draw all other Churches so excluded, to a most humble submission and acknowledgement, nay, to an earnest desire of a suddaine Reconciliation upon any Termes whatsoever. For howsoever they please to speak and write of our Hereticall and obstinate persistance in manifest Errors, yet I hope they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not seriously thinke we would be so irrationall, as to contradict him whom we our selves think beyond a possibillity of erring, and to dispute perpetually with them, whom onely to heare were to be satisfied.</p>
            <p>But when they have propounded their Decisions to be beleeved, and imbraced by us as Infallibly true, and that because they propound them, who in their own opinion are Infallible; if notwithstanding some of those Decisions seeme to us to be evidently false, because clearely contradictory to that which they themselves propound as infallibly true, that is the Word of God: surely we cannot be blamed, if we have desired their Infallibility to be most clearly demonstrated, at least to a higher degree of evidence then we have of the contradiction of their Decisions to the infallible Rule. Wherefore, The great Defenders of the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> have with more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb facs="tcp:54903:10"/>
diligence endeavoured to view the grounds of this Controversie, and have written by the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage either of their learning accurately, or of their parts most strongly, or of the cause it selfe most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly, against that darling Infallibility. How clearely this Controversie hath been managed, with what evidence of truth discussed, what successe so much of reason hath had, cannot more plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare then in this, that the very name of Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity before so much exalted, begins now to be very burthensome, even to the maintainers of it: Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as one of their latest and ablest Proselytes, <hi>Hugh Paulin de Cressy,</hi> lately Dean of <hi>Lagh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, &amp;c.</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Prebendary of <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> in his Exomologesis, or faithfull Narration of the occasion and motives of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, hath dealt very clearly with the World, and told us, that this <hi>Infallibilitie is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Word.</hi> That <hi>Mr.</hi> Chillingworth <hi>hath cumbated against it with too too great successe,</hi> so great, that <hi>he could wish the Word were forgotten, or at least layd by.</hi> That not onely Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> whom he still worthily admires; but we the rest of the poore <hi>Protestants have in very deed, very much</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:54903:11"/>
to say for our selves, when we are pressed unnecessarily with it. <hi>And therefore Mr.</hi> Cressy's <hi>advise to all the</hi> Romanists <hi>is this, that</hi> we may never be invited to combat the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church under that notion. <hi>Oh the strength of Reason rightly managed! O the power of Truth clearly declared! that it should force an emnient member of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>(whose great Principle is non=retractation) to retract so necessary, so fundamentall a Doctrine, to desert all their Schooles, and contradict all their Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertists. But indeed not without very good cause: For he professes withall,</hi> that no such word as Infallibility is to be found in any Councel: Neither did ever the Church enlarge her Authority to so vaste a widenesse: But doth rather deliver the victory into our hands when we urge her Decisions. <hi>In all which Confessions, although he may seeme one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to speak of the</hi> Word, <hi>yet that cannot be it which he is so wearie of, because we except not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the word at all, but confesse it rightly to signifie that which we impugne, neither do we ever bring any nominall Argument against it. But as when Cardinall</hi> Bellarmine <hi>sets downe</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:54903:11"/>
the Doctrine of the Church in their positive tearmes. <hi>Summus Pontifex, cum totam Ecclesiam docet, in his, quae ad Fidem per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, nullo casu errare potest.</hi> We conceive he hath sufficiently expressed the sence of the word <hi>Infallibility,</hi> so that, <hi>Infallibilis est, &amp; nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo casu errare potest,</hi> are to us the same thing. It cannot therefore be the Word alone, but the whole importance and sence of that word <hi>Infallibility,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> so earnestly desires all his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks ever hereafter to forsake, because the former Church did never acknowledge it, and the present Church will never be able to maintaine it. This is the great successe which the Reason, Parts, and Learning of the late Defendors of our Church have had in this maine Architectonicall Controversie.</p>
            <p>And yet though the Church never maintained it, though the Protestants have had such advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, though Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> confessing both, hath wished all Catholicks to forsake it, yet will he not wholly forsake it himself, but undertakes most irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally to answer for it. If the Church never asserted it, if the <hi>Catholicks be not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it,</hi> to what end will Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> the great mitigator of the rigor, and defendor of the
<pb facs="tcp:54903:12"/>
latitude of the Churches Decisions, maintaine it? If Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> have had such good successe against it, why will his old Friend Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi> endeavour to answer his arguments? especially, considering when he hath answered them all, he can onely from thence conclude that, Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> was a very bad Disputant, who could bring no argument able to confute that, which in it selfe is not to be maintained.</p>
            <p>So unreasonable it is and inconsistent with his Concessions, that he should give an answer at all, but the manner of his answer, which he gives, is farr more irrationall. For deserting the <hi>Infallibility,</hi> he answers onely the authority of the Church, and so makes this authority answer for that <hi>Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> from whence these three manifest absurdities must necessarily follow.</p>
            <p>First, When he hath answered all M. <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth's</hi> arguments, in the same manner as he pretends to answer them, he must still acknowledge them unanswerable, as they were intended by him that made them. And no argument need to be thought good for any thing else, if he which made it knew what he said, as Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> certainely <hi>did.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:54903:12"/>
Secondly, He onely pretends to answer those arguments, as against the authority of the Church, simply considered without relation to such an <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility,</hi> which were never made against an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity so quallified. And therefore whether the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his deare friend were to any purpose or no, his answer manifestly must be to none.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If hee intend to refute all opposition made to their <hi>Infallibility</hi> by an assertion of their bare authority, then must he assert that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to be as great and convincing, which is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, as that which is infallible: that Guide to be as good, which may lead me out of my way, as that which cannot. That Iudge to be as fit to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine any doubt, who is capable of a mistake, as he which is not. And then I make no question, but some of his own Church amongst the rest of their dislikes, will put him in mind of that handsome sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Cardinall <hi>Belarmine, Iniquissimum esset cogere Christianos, ut non appellent ab eo Judicio, quod erroneum esse potuit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I once thought to have replied to those answers, which he hath given to Mr. <hi>Chillingworth's</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments: but his antecedent Concession hath made them so inconsiderable to me, that upon a
<pb facs="tcp:54903:13"/>
second thought, I feare I should be as guilty in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying after my Objections, as he hath been in answering after his Confessions. Wherefore I shall conclude with an asseveration of mine own, which shall be therefore short because mine: That the Reply of this most excellent Person, <hi>Sola operarum summa praesertim in Graecis incuria excepta,</hi> is the most accurate Refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all, which can be said in this Controversie, that ever yet appeared, and if what hath already been delivered have had such successe upon so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent an adversary, then may we very rationally expect at least the same effect upon all, who shall be so happy as to read these Discourses.</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable, <hi>Henry</hi> Lord Viscount of <hi>Falkland,</hi> my Honourable Lord.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>NOt long before the death of that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable person, your Lordships Mother, that great example of piety and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the Lady <hi>Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countesse of Falkland,</hi> she was pleased to commit to my hand that, which she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, next her Children, the dearest pledge of her dead Lord; some excellent Monuments of his <hi>Reason, Wit,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,</hi> in the search of that, which he would have as gladly found, as he hath
<pb facs="tcp:54903:14"/>
rationally rejected, an <hi>Infallible Iudge</hi> here on Earth in all our Controversies in point of Religion, of which the labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing world seemeth at present to stand in so much need. I have considered often of that singular trust and friendship, in making me the depositarie of so rich a Jewell: And since she, from whose hands I received it, is gone thither, where she stands in no need of these discourses, I know no person living that hath more right to it then your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, or indeed to whom I would more willingly offer it. For though your Lordship be now out of my immediate charge and Tuition, yet as long as it shall please God to make me able to do, or point at any thing that may, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so little, helpe forward to perfect a good work in you, I shall never account my selfe disobliged. I must professe to all the World, that there is no Family now in being, to which I owe more true service, then to your Lordships: And shall to the utmost of my power, upon
<pb facs="tcp:54903:14"/>
all occasions make it good. I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left me but a poor thankfull heart, which hath been my onely sure Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, when all things else have forsaken me: That still remaines <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> being neither in the power of time nor persons to spoile me of that, which like a good Conscience to my self, must to my friends be the best feast I can make them.</p>
            <p>My Lord, my design is not by this to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage your Lordship in this <hi>Polemicall</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, nor my self neither, having neither ability nor leasure for a business of that concern, and by reason of my busie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, I had not been able to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented it thus to your Lordship, without the assistance of Judicious Friends, that honour the work for the Authors sake, and the Author for his owne.</p>
            <p>But, My Lord, I hope I shall have my end in it however, an end which no good man will envy me, namely, an occasion hereby to reminde your Lordship of the Gallant Author, your Noble Father, that
<pb facs="tcp:54903:15"/>
by proposing Him to you as your constant Coppy, you may do Him an honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all his Friends: For while they <hi>praise,</hi> you may <hi>imitate</hi> him.</p>
            <p>Indeed, it is one of the greatest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts I have in this calamitous life, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that I had the honour to be so neare Him: And a reproach, which I cannot clear my self of, to have been at the same time so neare, and so farr off; so neare in Conversation, and yet so farr removed from him in those Excellencies, whereby he was the envy of this Age, and will be the wonder of the next.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Religion,</hi> (for that I should begin with) was the more Eminent, because the more Early, at that age, when yong Gallants think least on it: When they, yong Candidates of Atheisme begin to dispute themselves out of a beleefe of a <hi>Deity,</hi> urging hard against that, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is best for them that it should never be, <hi>a Iudgement to come;</hi> then, I say, that sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which these mention with a scoff or a Jeere, he began to work out with
<pb facs="tcp:54903:15"/>
fear and trembling, and <hi>effectually</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that is, <hi>to honour and serve</hi> his Creator in the daies of his youth.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I may not forget his vast <hi>naturall parts: Dixit ex tempore</hi> saith <hi>Pliny</hi> of <hi>Isoeus, sed tanquam diu scripserit,</hi> and I may truely apply it to him, his Answers were quick and suddain, but such, as might very well seem to have been meditated. In short, his <hi>abilities</hi> were such, as though he needed no supplies of <hi>industry,</hi> yet his <hi>indust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> such as though he had had no <hi>parts</hi> at all. How often have I heard him pitty those Hawking and Hunting Gentlemen, who if unseasonable weather for their sports had betrayed them to keep home, without a worse excercise within doores, could not have told how to have spent their time: And all because they were such strangers to such <hi>good Companions,</hi> with whom he was so familiar, such as neither cloy nor weary any, with whom they converse, such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany as <hi>Erasmus,</hi> a person much esteemed by my Lord your Father, so much extolls in his 31, and 35, Epistle of his fourth
<pb facs="tcp:54903:16"/>
Book: Not friends of the Cellar, or the Kitchin; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed their <hi>owne</hi> friends rather then <hi>his</hi> who entertaineth them: But such, as being bidden, are ready, uninvited intrude not, that bite no mans meat or reputation, silent, not spoken to, spoken to, speak as we please, what we please, how long and how much we please: Candidly communicating themselves to us without betraying our secrets committed to them; that still tell us somewhat that may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light us for its Antiquitie, please us for its Novelty, or some way or other enrich our knowledge. While others studied the <hi>Heraldry</hi> of Horses, of Doggs, or at the best their owne: He, though not inferior to his Neighbours in Descent, and Honour, knowing well how much more glorious it is to be the first then the last of a Noble Family, (Blood without Vertue making Vice but more conspicuous) was so farr from relying upon that empty Title, that He seemed <hi>Ipse suos genuisse Parentes,</hi> to have <hi>begotten</hi> his Ancestors, and to have given
<pb facs="tcp:54903:16"/>
them a more Illustrious life, then he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieved from them.</p>
            <p>Though there were as much true worth closely treasured up in him, as well divided, had been able to have set up a hundred <hi>Pretenders,</hi> yet so much <hi>Modesty</hi> withall, that the hearing of any thing was more pleasing to him then one tittle of his owne praise.</p>
            <p>This Vertue was indeed in a high degree in him, and shewed it selfe upon all occasions. If any thing, though never so little unhandsomely, had been spoken or done where he was, he was the greatest sufferer in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and much more out of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance then he that made the offence. And surely he that was so tender of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans <hi>Civility,</hi> may very justly be presumed to have had a great regard to his owne. And so he had indeed. For though his <hi>Courage</hi> were as great as his <hi>Wit</hi> and his <hi>Learning,</hi> (and that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression high enough) his <hi>Valour</hi> so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted and dreadlesse, as his great

               </gap> In that fatall Haile that made more Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans then his Children: Yet to do an ill or an uncivill thing, he was an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Coward: Though he was of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> Stature, of his Courage too, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and in this most like him, afraid of nothing but to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>send.</p>
            <p>But what needs any body plead for his <hi>Civility</hi> more then this present Discourse, where he excels his <hi>Antagonist</hi> in that, as well as in reason, and shewes that a <hi>Gentleman.</hi> writ with a <hi>Scholars</hi> Pen.</p>
            <p>Before I shut up all, my Lord, one Vertue there is yet to be mentioned, which of all that ever had relation to his Lordship, I may not, I must not ever forget, and that was his <hi>Friendship.</hi> That is a Vertue, which by the unintermitted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of my life, I have had more then ordinary occasion to make use of. And that must needs say was it, which made all his other Graces and Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies relish to me, He being the dearest
<pb facs="tcp:54903:17"/>
and the truest Friend, that through the whole course of my unhappy life I ever had the happinesse to meet with.</p>
            <p>If it be a kind of pleasure to reade dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses of Friends and Friendship, What is it to enjoy such a Friend in whom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally was, what Excellencie either History can record, or almost Poetry faine?</p>
            <p>Nothing so hard in <hi>Lucians Toxaris,</hi> that he durst not do, and nothing so handsome in all <hi>Seneca's</hi> Lawes of <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,</hi> that he knew not how to do, and to out-do for his Friend.</p>
            <p>Let your Vertuous and dear Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, my Lord, and all your Kindred yet alive, speak to this: And your blessed Mother were she now alive, would say, she had the best of Friends before the best of Husbands. This was it that made <hi>Tew</hi> so valued a Mansion to us: For as when we went from <hi>Oxford</hi> thither, we found our selves never out of the Universitie: So we thought our selves never absent from our own beloved home. But I dare say no more of this, it being
<pb facs="tcp:54903:18"/>
now a mellancholy thing, I am sure to me, to call back into my memory happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse never to be recalled, and to afflict my self anew with the consideration of what felicity I have out-lived.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship is now the onely surviving pledge of that admired Father, of whom-when we his poor servants have said all we can, the Character will be farr too short. It is in you, and onely you, my Lord to set him out truely, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble him to the life, and that will be by taking that Evangelicall Counsell, <hi>Tu autem fac similiter:</hi> Do like him, live like him, and pardon me if I add one thing more, like him, Love</p>

            <head>OF THE INFALLIBILITY OF THE CHURCH OF ROME. A discourse written by the Lord Viscount <hi>FALKLAND.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O him that doubteth whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath any errors, they answer, that she hath none, for she never can have any; this being so much harder to beleeve then the first, had need be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by some certainer Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, if they expect that the beleefe of this one
<pb facs="tcp:54903:19"/>
should draw on whatsoever they please to propose; yet this, if offered to be proved by no better wayes, then we offer to prove by, that she hath erred; which are arguments from Scripture, and ancient Writers, all which they say are fallible, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is not so but the Church: Which if it be the onely infallible determination, and that can never be believed upon its owne authority, we can never infallibly know that the Church is infallible, for these other waies of proofe may deceive both them and us, and so neither side is bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve them; If they say that an argument out of Scripture is sufficient ground of Divine Faith, why are they offended with the Protestants for belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving every part of their Religion upon that ground, upon which they build all theirs at once. And if following the same Rule, with equall desire of finding the Truth by it, (having neither of those qualities which <hi>Isid. Pelus,</hi> saith are the cause of all Heresie, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Pride and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judication) why should God be more offended with the one, then with the other, though they chance to erre.</p>
            <p>They say, the Church is therefore made infallible by God, that all men may have some certain Guide; yet, though it be infallible, unlesse it both plainly appeare to be so, (for it is not certaine to whom it doth not appeare certaine) and unlesse it be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest which is the Church, God hath not attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his end; and it were to set a ladder to Heaven, and seem to have a great care of my going up, whereas unlesse there be care taken that I may
<pb facs="tcp:54903:19"/>
know this ladder is here to that purpose, it were as good for me it never had been set.</p>
            <p>If they say we may know, for that generall Tradition instructs us in it.</p>
            <p>I answer, that ignorant people cannot know this, and so it can be no Rule for them; and if learned people mistake in this, there can be no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for them.</p>
            <p>For suppose, to know whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may erre, (as a way which will conclude against her, but not for her) I seek whether she have erred; and conceiving she hath contradicted her self, conclude necessarily she hath erred, I suppose it not damnable, (though false) because I try the Church by one of the touch-stones which herself appoints me (Conformity with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients.) For to say, I am to beleeve the present Church, that it differs not from the former, though it seem to me to do so, is to send me to a witnesse, and bid me not beleeve it; now to say the Church is provided for a guide of Faith, but must be known by such markes as the ignorant cannot seek it by, and the learned may chance not find it by, can no way satisfie me.</p>
            <p>If they say God will reveale the Truth to whomsoever seeks it these waies sincerely, this saying both sides will (without meanes of being confuted) make use of, therefore it would be as good that neither did.</p>
            <p>When they have proved the Church to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, yet to my understanding they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded nothing farther, unlesse we can be sure
<pb facs="tcp:54903:20"/>
which is it. For it signifies onely that God will have a Church alwaies which shall not erre, but not that such, or such a succession shall be in the right, so that if they say, the <hi>Greek</hi> Church is not the Church, because by its own confession it is not Infallible: I answer, That it may be now the Church, and may hereafter erre, (and so not be now infallible) and yet the Church never erre, because before their fall from Truth, others may arise to maintaine it, who then will be the Church, and so the Church may still be infallible, though not in respect of any set persons, whom we may know at all times for our Guide.</p>
            <p>Then if they prove the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the true Church, and not the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their opinions are consonant either to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture or Antiquitie, they run into a Circle, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Tenets to be true. First, because the Church holds them: And then theirs to be the Church, because the Church holds the Truth: Which last, though it appears to me the onely way, yet it takes away its being a Guide, which we may follow without examination, without which all they say besides, is nothing.</p>
            <p>Nay, suppose that they had evinced, that some succession were Infallible, and so had proved to a learned man, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Chruch must be this, because none else pretends to it, yet this can be no sufficient ground to the ignorant, who cannot have any infallible foundation for their beleefe, that the Church of <hi>Greece</hi> pretends not to the same; and even to the Learned it is but an accidentall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
<pb facs="tcp:54903:20"/>
because if any other Company had likewise claimed to be Infallible, it had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown all.</p>
            <p>The chiefest reason why they disallow of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for Judge, is, because when differences arise about the interpretation, there is no way to end them: And that it will not stand with the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God, to damne men for not following his Will, if he had assigned no infallible way to find it.</p>
            <p>I confesse this to be wonderfull true, (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) and let them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse themselves that think otherwise; yet this will be no Argument against him that beleeves, that to them who follow their reason in the interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Scriptures, God will either give his Grace for assistance to find the Truth, or his pardon if they misse it: And then this supposed necessitie of an infallible Guide, (with the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed damnation for want of it) fall together to the ground.</p>
            <p>If they command us to beleeve infallibly the contrary to this, they are to prove it false by some infallible way (for the conclusion must be of the same nature, and not conclude more then the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses set down.) Now such a way Scripture, and Reason, and infused Faith cannot be, (for they use to object the fallibility of these, to those that build their Religion upon them) nor the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church, (for this is part of the Question, and must it self be first proved, and that by none of the former waies, for the former reasons.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:54903:21"/>
The Popes Infallibility can be no infallible ground of Faith, being it self no necessary part of Faith, and we can be no surer of any thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, then we are of that which proves it:) and if he be fallible, no part is the more infallible for his siding with them; So if the Church be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, I have no way to know the true Church, but by searching which agrees with Scripture and Antiquitie, and so judging accordingly: (but this is not to submit my self to her opinions, as my Guide, which they tell us is necessarie) which course, if they approve not of as fit for a learned man, they are in a worse case for the ignorant, who can take no course at all, nor is he the better at all for his Guide the Church, whilst two parts dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute which is it, and that by arguments he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands not.</p>
            <p>If I grant the Pope, or a Councell by him cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, to be infallible, yet I conceive their decrees can be no sufficient grounds, (by their own axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oms) of divine Faith.</p>
            <p>For first of all, no Councell is valid, not approved by the Pope, (for thus they overthrow that held at <hi>Ariminum</hi>) and a Pope chosen by <hi>Simony,</hi> is (<hi>ipso facto</hi>) no Pope.</p>
            <p>I can have then no certainer grounds for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of those decrees, and consequently for my beleefe of them, then I have, that the choice of him is neither directly, nor indirectly <hi>Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, suppose him Pope, and to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed their decrees; yet, that these are the decrees
<pb facs="tcp:54903:21"/>
of a Councell, or that he hath confirmed them, I can have but an uncontradicted confession of many men; (for if another Councell should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare these to have been the Acts of another for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Councell, I should need againe some certain way of knowing how this declaration is a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell) which is no ground, say they, of Faith, I am sure not so good and generall a one, as we have that the Scripture is Scripture, which yet they will not allow any to be certaine of, but from them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, For the sence of their decrees, I can have no better expounder then reason; which if (though I mistake) I shall not be damned for following, why shall I for mistaking the sence of the Scripture? or why am I a lesse fit Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of the one, then of the other? and when both seeme equally cleare, and yet contradictory, shall not I affoon beleeve Scripture which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt of as great authority?</p>
            <p>But I doubt whether Councells are fit deciders of Questions; for such they cannot be if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get more, and men are in greater doubts after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards (none of the former being diminished) then they were at ffrst.</p>
            <p>Now I conceive there arise so many out of this way, that the learned cannot end all, nor the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant know all. As (besides the fore-named consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations) who is to call them? the Pope or Kings? who are to have voices in them, Bishops onely, or Priests also? whether the Pope, or Councell be superiour: and the last need the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
<pb facs="tcp:54903:22"/>
of the first (debated amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?) Whether any Countries, not being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or not being there, (as the <hi>Abissines,</hi> so great a part of Christianitie, and not resolved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned by them for Hereticks, were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi>) make it not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall? Whether if it be one not every where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, (as when the Bishops sent from some places have exceeded their Commission, as in the Councell of <hi>Florence</hi>) it be yet of necessitie to be subscribed unto? Whether there were any sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reption or force used, and whether those disanull the Acts? Whether the most voices are to be held the Act of the Councell, or those of all required (which never yet agreed?) Or whether two parts will serve, as in the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Synod? A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable doubt; because <hi>Nicephorus Callistus,</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the resolution of a Councell at <hi>Rome,</hi> against that of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> makes him give three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
            <p>One, That the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
            <p>The Second, That most did not agree to it.</p>
            <p>The third, That others thither gathered, were displeased at their resolutions.</p>
            <p>Which proves, that (in their opinions) if either most not present, agree not to it, or all present be not pleased with it, a Councell hath no power to bind.</p>
            <p>All these doubts I say perswade me, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever brings with it so many new Questions, can be no fit end of the old.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:54903:22"/>
Then, if before a generall Councell have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined a Question, it be lawfull to hold either way, and damnable to do so after; I desire to know why it is so. Scripture and Tradition seem to me not to say so? but if they did so, I suppose you will grant they do this Doctrine, <hi>That the Soules of the blessed shall see God before the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> (and not be kept in secret Receptacles) for without this, the Doctrine of Prayers to Saints, cannot stand; and yet, for denying this, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> excuseth Pope <hi>John</hi> the 22<hi rend="sup">t</hi>h because the Church (he meanes, I doubt not, a generall Councell) had not then condemned it.</p>
            <p>I desire to know, why he should not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as well without one, as many Hereticks, that are held so by their Church, yet condemned by none: (which if he make to be the Rule of Heresie, it had been happy to have lived before the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> when no opinion had been dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, but some against the Apostles Councell at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> because there had yet been no other generall Councell;) at least, why should not I be excused by the same reason, though I beleeve not a Councell to be infallible? since I never heard that any Councell hath decreed that they are so, neither if it hath, can we be bound by that decree, unlesse first made certaine some other way, that it selfe is so.</p>
            <p>If you say, we must beleeve it because of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, I answer, Sometimes you will have the not beleeving any thing not declared by a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, to have power enough to damne (that is when
<pb facs="tcp:54903:23"/>
against any of us:) at other times the Church hath not decreed unlesse a Councell have, and their error is pardonable, and they good Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.</p>
            <p>Next, (as I have asked before) how shall an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant man know it? For he in likelihood can speak but with a few, from whom he cannot know, that all of the Church of <hi>Romes</hi> part do now, and in past ages have beleeved it to be Tradition, so certaine as to make it a ground of Faith, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he have some revelation that those deceived him not) neither indeed can those that should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him of the opinions of former times be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely informed themselves: For truely, if the relation of <hi>Pappias</hi> could cozen so far all the prime Doctors of the Christian Church into a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe of the celebration of a thousand yeeres after the resurrection, so as that no one of those two first ages oppose it, (which appeares plainly enough, because those that after rise up against this, never quoated any thing for themselves before <hi>Dionysius Alexandrinus,</hi> who lived at least two hundred and fifty yeares after Christ;) nay, if those first men did not onely beleeve it as probable, but <hi>Justine Martir</hi> saith, he holds it, and so do all that are in all parts Orthodox Christians, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Irenaeus</hi> sets it down direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a Tradition, and relates the very words that Christ used, when he taught this, which is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then any other Tradition, is proved or said to be out of antiquity by them) if I say these could be so deceived, why might not other of the
<pb facs="tcp:54903:23"/>
ancients as well be deceived in other points, and then what certaintie shall the learned have (when after much labour, they think they can make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that the ancients thought any thing Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) that indeed it was so, and that either the folly or the knavery of some <hi>pappias</hi> deceived them not? I confesse it makes me think of some that <hi>Tully</hi> speakes of, who <hi>arcem amittunt, dum propugnacula defendunt,</hi> loose the Fort, whilst they defend the out-works; For whilst they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer this way the Arguments of Tradition for the opinions of the <hi>Chiliasts,</hi> they make unusefull to themselves the force of Tradition, to prove any else by.</p>
            <p>For which cause it was rather wisely then ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly done of them, who (before <hi>Fevardentius</hi> set him forth) left out that part of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> which we alleadge, (though we need it not much; for many of the Fathers take notice of this beleef of his) yet he justifies himself for doing it, by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that if they leave out all errors in the books they publish, (that is, I suppose, all opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) <hi>bona pars scripto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, Patrum Orthodoxorum evanesceret,</hi> a great part of the writings of the Orthodox Fathers must vanish away.</p>
            <p>But the Tradition that can be found out of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients (since their witnessing may dceeive us) hath much lesse strength, when they argue onely thus, sure so many would not say this is true, if there were no Tradition for them,</p>
            <p>I would have you remember, they can deliver
<pb facs="tcp:54903:24"/>
their opinions possibly, but either before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie arise in the Church, (upon some chance) or after; If before, it is confessed that they writ not often cautiously enough, and so they answer all they seem to say for <hi>Arrius,</hi> and <hi>Pelagius</hi> his Faith, before themselves, and so consequently, their controversie (though it may be not their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) arose.</p>
            <p>If after, Then they answer often, (if any thing be by them at that time spoken against them) that the heat of disputation brought it from them, and their resolution to oppose hereticks enough; I desire, it may be lawfull for us to answer so too, (either one of these former waies, or that it was (as often they say too) some Hyperbole) when they presse us with the opinions of Fathers.</p>
            <p>At least I am sure, if they may deceive us with saying a thing is Tradition, when it is not, we may be sooner deceived if we will conclude it for a Tradition, when they speak it onely as a Truth, and (for ought appeares) their particular opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Befides, If <hi>Salvian</hi> comparing the <hi>Arrians</hi> with evill livers, (and that after they were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a Councell) extenuates (by reason of their beleeving themselves in the right) with much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, the fault of the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and saith, how they shall be punished in the day of Judgement, none can know but the Judge.</p>
            <p>If I say, They confesse it to be his opinion, they must also confesse the Doctrine of the Church to differ from that of <hi>Salvians</hi> time, because he
<pb facs="tcp:54903:24"/>
was allowed a member of that, for all this saying, whereas he of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that should now say so of us, would be counted <hi>sesqui-haereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> 
               <g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Heretick and halfe, or else they must say (which they can onely say, and not prove) that he was so earnest against ill men, that for the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of their crime, he lessened that of the Hereticks, and said, what at another time he would not have said; which if they do, will it not overthrow wholly the authority of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Since we can never infallibly know, what they thought at all times, from what they were moved to say at some one time, by some Collatericall considerations.</p>
            <p>Next, To this certaine and undoubted dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all out of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which averteth me from it, comes their putting all to death that are so, where they have power (which is an effect, though not a necessary one of the first opinion) and that averteth me yet more, for I do not beleeve all to be damned that they damne, but I conceive all to be killed that they kill; I am sure if you look upon <hi>Constantines</hi> Epistle; written to perswade concord upon their first disagreement between <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Arrius,</hi> you will find, that he thought, and if the Bishops about him had then thought otherwise, he would have been sure better informed) that neither side deserved either death, or damnation, (and yet sure you will say, this Question was as great as ever rose since) for having spoken of the opinions, as things so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, that the Reader might almost think
<pb facs="tcp:54903:25"/>
that they had been fallen out at spurn-point, or kittle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pins, he adds, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for that which is necessary is one thing, that all agree, and keep the same Faith, about divine Providence. I am sure, in the same Author, <hi>Moses</hi> (a man praised by him) refusing to be made Bishop by <hi>Lucius,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was an <hi>Arrian,</hi> and he answering that he did ill to refuse it, because he knew not what his Faith was, answered, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> The banishing of Bishops shew enough thy Faith. So that it is plaine, that he thought punishing for opinions to be a mark, which might serve to know false opinions by. And I beleeve throughout Antiquitie, you will find no putting any to death, unlesse it be such as begin to kill first, as the <hi>Circumcellians,</hi> or such like: I am sure Christian Religions chiefest glory being, that it encreaseth by being persecuted; and having that advantage of the <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> which came in by force, me thinks (especially since <hi>Synesius</hi> had told us, and Reason told men so before <hi>Synesius,</hi> that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Every thing is destroyed by the contrary to what setled and composed it;) It should be to take ill care of Christianity, to hold it up by Turkish meanes, at least it must breed doubts, that if the Religion had alwaies remained the same, it would not be now defended by waies so contrary to those, by which at first it was propagated.</p>
            <p>I desire recrimination may not be used; for though it be true, that <hi>Calvin</hi> had done it, and
<pb facs="tcp:54903:25"/>
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> a little (which is a little too much) for <hi>negare manifesta non audeo, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusare immodica non possum,</hi> yet she (confessing she may erre) is not so chargeable with any fault, as those which pretend they cannot, and so will be sure never to mend it; and besides I will be bound to defend no more then I have undertaken, which is to give reason why the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</p>
            <p>I confess this opinion of damning so many, and this custome of burning so many, this breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up those, who knew nothing else in any point of Religion, yet to be in a readinesse to cry, <hi>To the fire with him, to Hell with him,</hi> (as <hi>Polybius</hi> saith in a certaine furious faction of an army of severall nations, and consequently of severall lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> They all joyned onely in understanding this word, [<hi>throw at him.</hi>] These I say, in my opinion were chiefly the causes which made so many, so suddenly leave the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that indeed to borrow the same Authors Phrase, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> They needed no perswasion to do it, but onely newes that others had done it: For as this alone if beleeved, makes all the rest to be so too, so one thing alone disliked, (where infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility is claimed) overthrowes all the rest.</p>
            <p>If it were granted, that it agreeth not with the goodnesse of God, to let men want an infallible Guide, and therefore there must be one, and that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were it, yet if that teach any thing to my understanding contrary to Gods
<pb facs="tcp:54903:26"/>
goodnesse, I am not to receive her Doctrine, for the same cause for which they would have me receive it, (it being as good an argument this guide teacheth things contrary to Gods goodnesse, therefore this is not appointed by God, as to say, it is agreeable to his goodnesse there should be one, therefore there is one) and sure it is lawfull to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine particular Doctrines, whether they agree with that Principle, which is their foundation; and for that (me thinks) to damn him, that neither with negligence, nor prejudication, searches what is Gods will, (though he misse of it) is as contrary, as the first can be supposed.</p>
            <p>Next, I would know, whether he, that hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> shall yet be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for not beleeving her infallible?</p>
            <p>I have so good an opinion of them, as to assure my self, they will answer he shall not.</p>
            <p>I will then ask, whether he that hath searched what Religions there are, and finds hers to be one, and her infallibility to be a part of it, (if his reason will not assent to that) shall be damned for being inquisitive after Truth, (for he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted no other fault, greater then the other) and whether such an ignorance, (I mean after impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall search) be not of all other the most invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible?</p>
            <p>Nay, grant the Church to be infallible, yet me thinks, he that denies it, and imploies his reason to seek, if it be true, should be in as good case, as he that beleeveth it, and searcheth not at all the truth of the Proposition he receives; For I cannot see
<pb facs="tcp:54903:26"/>
why he should be saved, because by reason of his parents beleef, or the Religion of the Country, or some such accident, the Truth was offered to his understanding, when, had the contrary been offered, he would have received that. And the other damned, that beleeves falshood upon as good ground, as the other doth truth, unlesse the Church be like a Conjurers Circle, that will keep a man from the Divell, though he came unto it by chance.</p>
            <p>They grant no man is an Heretick, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves not his Heresie obstinately, and if he be no Heretick, he may sure be saved; It is not then certain damnation for any man to deny the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but for him one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that denies it obstinately; And then I am safe, for I am sure I do not; Neither can they say, I shall be damned for Schisme, though not for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, for he is as well no Shcismatick, though in Schisme, that is willing to joyne in Communion with the true Church, when it appears to be so to him, as he is no Heretick, though he holds He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall opinions, who holds them not obstinately, that is (as I suppose) with a desire to be informed if he be in the wrong.</p>
            <p>Next, Why if it be not necessary alwaies to beleeve the Truth, so one beleeve in generall what the Church would have beleeved, (for so they excuse great men that have held contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions to theirs now, before they were defined, or knew them to be so) why I say, shall not the same implicite assent serve to whatsoever God would
<pb facs="tcp:54903:27"/>
have assented unto? (though I mistake what that is:) when indeed to beleeve implicitely what God would have beleeved, is to beleeve implicitely likewise what the Church teacheth, if this Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine be within the number of those, which God commands to be beleeved.</p>
            <p>I have the lesse doubt of this opinion, that I shall have no harme for not beleeving the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> because of my being so farr from leaning to the contrary, and so suffering my will to have power over my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, that if God would leave it to me, which Tenet should be true, I would rather chuse, that that should, then the contrary.</p>
            <p>For they may well beleeve me, that I take no pleasure in tumbling hard and unpleasant Books, and making my self giddy with disputing obscure Questions, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> If I should beleeve, there should alwaies be, whom I might alwaies know, a society of men, whose opinions must be certainely true, and who would <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> labour to discusse and define all arising doubts, so that I might be excusably at ease, and have no part left for me but that of obedience, which must needs be a lesse difficult, and so a more agreeable way, then to endure endlesse Volumes of Commenters, the harsh <hi>Greek</hi> of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and the harder <hi>Latin</hi> of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and be pained by distinguishing between different sences, and various Lections, and he would deserve not the lowest place in <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> that would preferr these studies before so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb facs="tcp:54903:27"/>
so more pleasant; that would rather imploy his understanding then submit it, and if he could think God imposed upon him onely the resisting temptations, would by way of addition require from himself, the resolving of doubts; yet I say not, that all these Books are to be read by those that understand not the languages, (for them I conceive their seeking into the Scripture may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice) but he who hath by Gods grace skill to look into them, cannot better use it then in the searching of his will, where they say it is to be found, that he may assent to them, if there he find reason for it, or if not, they may have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse for not excusing him.</p>
            <p>For whereas they say it is pride makes us doubt of their Infallibilitie.</p>
            <p>I answer, That their too much lazinesse and impatience of examining is the cause, that many of them do not doubt.</p>
            <p>Next, what pride is it never to assent, before I find reason (since they, when they follow their Church as infallible, pretend reason for it, and will not say they would, if they thought they found none) and if they say, we do find reason, but will not eonfesse it, then pride hinders not our assent, but our declaration of it, which if it do in any one, he is without question <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> con demned by himself, and it must be a very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Advocate, that would strive to acquit him.</p>
            <p>One much prevailing argument, which they make, is this, That whosoever leaves them, sall into dissention between themselves, whereas
<pb facs="tcp:54903:28"/>
they in the mean while are allwaies at Unity.</p>
            <p>I answer,</p>
            <p>First, In this whereof the Question is now, they all assent.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When there is fire for them that disagree, they need not bragg of their Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity who consent.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they have many differences among them, as whether the Pope be Infallible? whether God predeterminate every action? whether Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion and Reprobation depend upon fore-sight? Which seemes to me as great as any between their Adversaries, and in the latter, the Jesuites have ancienter, and generaller Tradition on their side, then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath in any other Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and as much ground from Reason for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Gods goodnesse, as they can think they have for the necessity of an infallible guide.</p>
            <p>Yet these arguments must not make the <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans</hi> Hereticks, and must us: If they say the Church hath not resolved it, (which signifies onely that they are not agreed about it, which is that we object) I answer, It ought to have done so, if uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Ancient Church be required, in which all that ever I could heare of, before Saint <hi>Austine</hi> (who is ever various I confesse in it) delivered the contrary to the <hi>Dominicans</hi> as not doubtfull; and to say it is lawfull for them to disagree, wheresoever they do not agree, is ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, (for they cannot do both at once about the same point) and if they say they mean by the Churches not having concluded it, that a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
<pb facs="tcp:54903:28"/>
hath not: I Answer,</p>
            <p>First, That they condemne some without any Councell, and why not these?</p>
            <p>Next, I say the opinion of the diffused Church is of more force, then the conclusion of the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative (which hath its authority from the other) and therefore if all extant for the first four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered yeares taught any Cannon it is more Heresie to deny that, then any Cannon of a Councell; But may not howsoever any other Company of People (that would maintaine themselves to be infallible) say as much, that all other Sects differ from one another, and therefore should all agree with them, would not those (think they) ascribe all other mens dissentions, and learned mens fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into diverse heresies to their not allowing their Infallibility, to their not assenting to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, and not suffering them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to sit as teachers of those things that come in Question, and to have all others in the place of Disciples obedient to them, which is that which <hi>Nilus</hi> a <hi>Greek</hi> Bishop professed, that (because the <hi>Greeks</hi> would not allow the <hi>Romans</hi>) was the chief cause of separation between them.</p>
            <p>Next, They use much to object, how could errors come into the Church without opposition, and mention both of them, and the opposition to them in History.</p>
            <p>I answer,</p>
            <p>They might come not at once, but by degrees, as in the growth of a Child, or motion of a Clock,
<pb facs="tcp:54903:29"/>
we see neither in the present, but know there was a present when we find it past.</p>
            <p>Next, I say there are two sorts of errors; To hold a thing necessary that is unlawfull, and false; or that is but profitable, and probable. Of the second sort, that errors should come in, it appears not hard to me, (especially in those ages where want of Printing, made Books, and consequently Learning, not so common as now it is, where the few that did study, busied themselves in Schoole speculations onely, when the authority of a man of chief note, had a more generall influence then now it hath, and so as <hi>Thucidides</hi> saith the Plague did in his time, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the disease that first settled in the head EASILY passed through all the body, considering how apt men are to desire that all men should think as they do, and consequently to lay a necessity upon the receiving that opinion, if they conceive that a way to have it received. And then if it were beleeved generally, profitable (as confession) who would be apt to oppose their call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it necessary, for the same cause for which they called it so.</p>
            <p>Besides, If this error were delivered by some Father in the hot opposition of some Heretick, it may be none would oppose it, least the adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries might take advantage by their dissention, and he that disputed for the Orthodox side, might lose by it much of his authority.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>necessary</hi> it self, is also often used for very convenient, and then from necessary in that
<pb facs="tcp:54903:29"/>
sence, to absolutely necessary is no difficult change, though it be a great one.</p>
            <p>Then the Fathers use the word Hereticks, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a larger sence, and sometimes in a stricter, and so differ in the reckoning them up, some lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out those that others put in, (though they had seen the precedent Catalogue) and so the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnesse of the sence of these words might bring in error: Names also, as <hi>Altar, Sacrifice, Masse,</hi> may have been used.</p>
            <p>First, in one sence, and the name retained though the thing signified received change; as it was once of an Emperour of <hi>Rome, cui proprium fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> 
               <hi>nuper reperta,</hi> (I leave out <hi>scelera</hi>) <hi>priscis verbis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegere,</hi> whose property it was to cover things newly found with ancient tearmes, And the same Author tells us, that the same state, was as it were, cheated out of her liberty, because there did remaine <hi>eadem Magistratuum vocabula,</hi> the same titles of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates: And I beleeve, that if the Protestants beyond the Seas would have thought Bishops as good a word as <hi>Super-intendents,</hi> (and so in other such things) many, who understand nothing but names, would have missed the scandale they have now taken. These waies I think these things may have come, without much opposition from being thought profitable to be done, and probable to be beleeved, to be thought necessary to be both; and how things may have been by little and little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived under old names, which would not have been so at once under new ones, it is not hard to conceive.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:54903:30"/>
The first of these being no such small fault, but that part of the Montanists Heresies was, thinking uncommanded fasting daies necessary to be observed, which without doubt might lawfully have been kept, so that no necessitie had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.</p>
            <p>But my maine answer is, that if to be in the Church without known precedent opposition, be a certaine note of being derived from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, let them answer how came in the opinion of the <hi>Chiliasts,</hi> not contradicted till two hundred yeares after it came in.</p>
            <p>To conclude, If they can prove that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture may be a certainer teacher of truth to them, then to us, so that they may conclude the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Church out of it, and we nothing; If they can prove the Churches Infallibility to be a sufficient Guide for him, that doubts which is the Church, and cannot examine that (for want of learning) by her chiefe marke, which is conformity with the Ancients: If they can prove, that the consent of Fathers long together, is a stronger Argument against us, then against the <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans;</hi> If they can prove (though it be affirmed by the first of them, that such a thing is Tradition, and beleeved by all Christians, and this assertion till a great while after, uncontradicted) yet they are not bound to receive it, and upon lesse grounds we are; If indeed any can prove by any infallible way, the Infallibility of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the necessity under paine of damnation for all men to beleeve it, (which were the more strange,

because <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Clements Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus</hi> among the Ancients, and <hi>Erasmus,</hi> and <hi>Ludovicus Vives</hi> among the Modernes, beleeve some <hi>Pagans</hi> to be saved) I will subscribe to it, and <gap reason="foreign">

Creator, the aid (whereof how much greater the wonder was to bee, and the necessity, now divers thousand yeers by lamentable experience was more deer, so much the readier was he) and it was to send from his eternall brest, his only wisedome to recount us wonders, and averre them under the seal of his immutable truth. He knew all secrets, and could not be touched with suspition of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; he was all goodness, and free from all calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of jealousie or envie: who knew him, could not mistrust him, for beside those great Verdicts alreadie expressed in his favour, his works gave assurance of his words, he fulfilling in deeds, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he perswaded in words, and working to himself, what he wished unto others. Lo here, the high, and sage Master of our faith, whose O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles we cannot mis-doubt, so we be assured they are his; and who hath in vain spent so much sweat, and pains, if after he passed from hence, he hath left no meanes to assure mankind, what it was hee taught and practised, and for the teaching and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising of it, eschewed not the stormie passage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Bethlehem</hi> and <hi>Mount Calvarie:</hi> but as in <hi>Bethlehem</hi> he multiplied the three drops of his Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision into the thousands of innocent Brooks; so upon the Mount <hi>Calvarie</hi> he opened the great Source, which hath now through 16. Ages irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated the world with an infinitie of streames of proportionall examples of Blood and sufferance. Now was his Legacie performed, and hee from Mount <hi>Olivet</hi> triumphantly returned, from whence he was come, and the world left to be saved by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54903:32"/>
faith, that is, by a constant perswasion of those things which he had taught.</p>
               <p>The Conditions of this Faith were three. First, That it should be a means fitting for humane kind, that is, for learned, and unlearned, for yong, and old, for wise, and fooles, for Princes and pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants, Rabbies, and Ideots. Secondly, That it should be a tenent, constant, undoubted, undispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, uncontroulable. Thirdly, That it should be a rule of our life and actions, making but a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of this present life, to the following, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to contemn the present and seen substance, in hope of an unseen and absent fortune. <hi>Certes,</hi> a hard taske, and which needeth to be well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and founded by God himself. For who well considereth it, cannot doubt it, to be as great a miracle (to make the whole Masse of mankinde, to forsake what it seeth, and take to obscure hopes or things, it does not so much apprehend what they are) as to force the strongest works of nature, to hang the sea in the aire, to alter the course of Moon, and Starres, and whatsoever else is strange and incredible in nature. Besides that, to make a way of knowledge common, and indifferent to learned, and unlearned, to make the ignorant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, what the learned cannot reach unto, and the learned die in defence of the truth he hath no other warrant for; then because he hath learned it from an ignorant person, was the work of him alone who framed them both, and understood in what veins so different blouds doe run.</p>
               <p>But done it was to be, and how? Those to whom
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54903:33"/>
during his life, he had most fully declared his mind, went, and told it to others, and all was done. We cannot denie the way to have been fitting, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, so it be found efficacious and powerfull to effect, what the Author intended. For if Faith must beleeve what Christ hath taught, what better instrument to breed faith, then who heard him speak? If Faith must be common to learned, and unlearned, what better meanes, then by hearing? From which no unlearnednesse can excuse, nor learnednesse be exempt. Every man may have from whom to hear and learn, if not a wiser then himselfe, yet one who may have properties to be a better witnesse. Children naturally beleeve what their parents tell them, unlearned men what Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors teach them, absent men, what those who were present doe report. All this goeth very well, so that this Expedient prove efficacious to the end in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
               <p>But it hath the prejudice of humane fallibilitie, for <note place="margin">Object.</note> who, for weaknesse that he doth not carry away what he hath heard, who, for vanity to seem to know more then his fellowes, who, to make some lucre of it, or for some emulation to some other; but seldome it hapneth that a multitude can carry away a thing all in the same manner; and 1600 yeers are passed since, so that it is not credible, a Doctrine so delivered can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sever incorrupted untill this day.</p>
               <p>Yet if we look into the immediate progresse and <note place="margin">Answ.</note> joints of the descent, we cannot finde where it can misse, for the doctrine being supernaturall, and not delivered by mans skill or wit, the first and main
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54903:33"/>
principle of it can be no other, then to know what was delivered them by their Teachers, a thing not surpassing the understanding of any sensible wise man; so that put but twenty wise understanding men to agree, that the Preacher, to their certaine knowledge, said such a thing, there remaineth no probable nor possible doubt, but that it was so.</p>
               <p>Now then suppose, that one of those (who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been taught by Christs own mouth, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the confirmation of the Holy Ghost, that he could neither forget nor forgoe this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived doctrine) should have preached over and over again the same doctrine not long, nor hard to be carryed away in all the Cities, Towns, and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs of some great Country, so that whilst he stayd there, they were throughly understanding and endoctrinated in that way. Now let him be gone, and after him all dead, who had heard him speake; and then some question arise concerning this doctrine (as we may say in the second age) let us see whether error can creep in or no, if the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians keepe unto their hold. Their hold is what they were taught by Christs Apostles. Let there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wisest and best men of those Cities and Towns meet together about the controversie, and discusse it out of this principle (what was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto them as taught by the Apostles) will not there be a quick end of their dispute? For every man can say, My father heard the Apostle speak, he understood him to have said this, so he himselfe beleeved, so he taught me, that this was that which the Apostle taught us. And when
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54903:34"/>
out of divers Cities and Towns, shall come a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of witnesses, all agreeing in one point, how can it be doubted, but that this is Christs doctrine, and that which his Apostle taught? And to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree how is it possible? Since all their fathers heard the same things, and things not above their capacity, and often told them, and well apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by them when they were taught, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence could not tell their children otherwise then what they had heard and understood, in a matter of such moment, and of which they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended no lesse, then that it concerned their own, and their childrens salvation, happinesse, or mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for all eternity. And what here is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently certaine, in the children of those who heard the Apostles, may be derived with as much evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence again in the grand-children, and so in every age even to our present; for if in any age any question beginne, and it be reduced unto this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; what did our forefathers teach us? neither can there be any pretended ignorance (for who can be ignorant of what was taught him when he was a childe, and in what he was bred, as in the grounds and substance of his hopes, for all eternity?) True it is, that if men leave this principle, and seek to judge the controversie by learned discourse, then may the Church be divided, one part follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the authority of their Ancestors; the other the subtle Arguments, and the great opinion they conceive, of the learning of their present Teachers: so that one side will claimesuccession, and to have received it from hand to hand; the other the glory
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54903:34"/>
of great learning, and to have come by great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry to discover the errors of their forefathers. But it is evident, that if what the Apostles preached be the touchstone of what is true, and what they preached to be seen in what those beleeve who have heard them, and they who received it from them that heard them; It is most evident, I say, that the one part, who seek for Christian truth in learned discourse, must needs forgoe the most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and easie way, of attaining unto what they aime at: And likewise evident, that who keep themselves duly and carefully unto this principle cannot possibly in any continuance of time, swerve from the truth which Christ hath left unto his Church. So that the whole difficulty is redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced unto this, whether the Church for so many ages be perpetually preserved in this principle, that what she received from her forefathers is, that she must beleive, and deliver unto her poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; A thing so grafted in nature; which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth us receive our being, our breeding, our lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, our goods, our estates, our arts, and all things we have, from our fathers, that it is a wonder of our mutability, that without forcible Engines we can be drawn from it.</p>

               <p>NOw let us turn our discourse, and as we have seen, that if our Saviour ordred his Apostles in the manner explicated, there was no way for his Church to swerve from his truth, but by swerving from the most plain, the most naturall, and most evident, and concluding rule of his doctrine, and that but one, and most easie; so let us see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the present Church we can draw the like forcible train, which may lead us up to Christ and his Apostles. Be therefore supposed or imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, what no judicious man can deny to see with his eyes, if he hath never so little cast them upon this present religion of Christendome, to wit; that there is one Congregation or Church which layeth claime to Christ his doctrine, as upon this title, that she hath received it from his Apostles without in erruption, delivered ever from Father to Sonne, from Master to Scholler, from time to time, from hand to hand, even unto this day; and that she does not admit any other doctrine for good and legitimate, which she does not receive in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Againe, that whosoever pretendeth Christ his truth against her, saith, that true it is, that once she had the true way, but that by length of time she is fallen into grosse errours which they will reforme, not by any truth they have received from hand to hand, from those who by both parts are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to have received their lesson from
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54903:36"/>
Christ and his Apostles, but by study and learned Arguments, either out of ancient Writers, or out of the secrets of nature and reason. This being supposed, either this principle hath remained unto her since the beginning, or she took it up in some one age of the 16 she hath endured; if she took it up in some latter age, she then thought she had nothing in her what she had not received from her fore fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in this sort: And if she thought so, she knew it. For as it is impossible now any country should think it was generally taught, such a thing if it were not so; so also was there the like necessity, and impossibility to be otherwise, if all men were not runne mad. Therefore clear it is, she took it not up first then, but was in former possession, and so clear it is, that she could not have it now, if she had it not from the very beginning. Now if she had it, and hath conserved it from the beginning, no new opinion could take root in her, unlesse it came unto her under this Maxime, as received from hand, to hand; and to say, that any opinion which was not truly received from hand to hand, should by such a community be accepted, as recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from hand to hand, is to make it beleeve, what it seeth clearly to be false, to lye unto it's own soule, against it's own soule, and the soule of it's posterity. Let us adde to this, that the multitude of this Church is so dispersed through so many Countries and languages of so divers governments, that it is totally impossible they should agree together, or meet upon a false determination, to affirme with one consent a falsity for truth, no interest being able to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54903:37"/>
be common unto them all to produce such an effect. Wherefore as an understanding man cannot chuse but laugh at the self-weening <hi>Hampshire</hi> Clown, who thinks in his heart there was no such Country as <hi>France,</hi> and that all that was told of it were but Travellers tales, because himselfe being upon the Sea shore, had seen nothing but water beyond <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> so I think no wise man will accompt him lesse then phrentick, that understandeth so little in humane wayes, as to think whole Nations by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, or by hazard, can agree together to professe, and protest a thing, which they know of their own knowledge to be a meer lye, and a well known falshood to themselves, and all their neighbours.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <p>THe force of the declared linke of succession, is so manifest to a capable understanding, that being compared with any objection made against it, it will of it selfe maintain it's evidence, and bear down the greatest oppositors and opposition, if the understanding be left unto it selfe, and not wrested by the prejudice of a some wayes interessed will. Neverthelesse, there is a deeper root, which greatly strengthens and reduceth into action, the former efficacity of the tradition. And this is, that Christian doctrine is not a speculative knowledge, instituted for delight of man to entertain his un derstanding, and hath no further end then the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation which ariseth out of contemplation; but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54903:37"/>
it is an art of living, a rule of attaining unto eternall blisse, a practicall doctrine whose end is to informe our action, that our life and actions squared by her directions, may lead us to that great good, the which God Almighty esteemed so highly of; that he thought it reason enough for him to shade his Divinity under the misery of man, to make us partakers of so great a blisse. Hence it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that no error can fall, even in a point which seemeth wholly speculative in Christian faith, but soone it breedeth a practicall effect, or rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in Christian behaviour. What could seem more speculative, then whether the second, or third Persons of the Trinity were truly or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipately God? Yet no sooner was an error broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in these questions, but there followed a great alteration in Christian action; in their Baptismes, in their manner of Prayer, in the motives of Love and Charity toward Almighty God, the very ground-work and foundation of all Christian life. Whether man hath free-will or no, seemeth a question, belonging to the nature of man, fit for a curious Phylosopher; but upon the preaching of the negative part, presently followed an unknowen Libertinage, men yeilding themselves over to all concupiscence, since they were perswaded they had no power to resist, free-will being denyed. I need not instance in prayer to Saints, worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Images, prayer for the dead, and the like; which is evident, could not be changed without an apparent change in Christian Churches. So that a doctrine contrary to faith, is like a disease,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54903:38"/>
which although the cause be internall, yet cannot the effects and symptomes be kept from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts and view of the world. The conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence which this note draweth, is, that it is not possible, that any materiall point of Christian faith can be changed, as it were by obreption, whilst men are on sleepe, but it must needs raise a great scandall and tumult in the Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale. For suppose the Apostles had taught the world it were Idolatry to pray to Saints, or use reverence towards their Pictures: How can we imagine this honour brought in, without a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement conflict and tumult, in a people which did so greatly abhor Idolatry, as the Apostles, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples did? I might make the like instance in other points, if the whole History of the Church did not consist of the invasions made by Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, and the great and most violent waving of the Church to and fro upon those occasions. We remember in a manner as yet, how change came into <hi>Germany, France, Scotland,</hi> and our own Country: Let those be a signe to us, what we may thinke can be the creeping in of false doctrine; specially, that there is no point of doctrine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Catholique Church, rooted in any Christian Nation, that the Ecclesiasticall History does not mention the times and combats by which it entred, and tore the Church in peices.</p>
               <p>Let it therefore remaine for most evidently constant, that into the Christian Church can come no error, but it must be seen and noted, and raise scandall and opposition to shew it selfe (as truly it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54903:38"/>
is) contrary to the nature of Piety and Religion. And when it does come, it cannot draw after it any others, then such as first desert the root of Faith, and Anchor of Salvation, that is to be judged by what their fore-fathers taught them, and affirmed to have received from their Ancestors, as the Faith which Christ and his Apostles delivered to the whole world of their time, and to such as ever claime and maintaine the right of succession, as rule of what they beleeve. Yet may this also be worthy of consideration, that as in our naturall body, the principall parts are defended by Bones, Flesh, Skinnes, and such like defences, in such sort, that no outward Agent can come to offend them, before having annoyed some of these; so in the Catholique faith, there are in speculation those we call Theologicall conclusions, and other pious opinions; and in practise many Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which stop the passage unto the maine principall parts of Christian beleife and action. And about these we see daily such great motions in the Catholique Church, that he must be very ignorant of the Spirit of God, which quickneth his Church, that can imagine any vitall part of his faith can be wounded while it lyes asleep, and is insensible of the harm befalleth it; for as in any Science a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple cannot be mistaken, but it must needs draw a great shoale of false consequence upon it, and lame the whole Science, so never so little an error in faith can be admitted, but in other Tenets and Ceremonies it must needs make a great change, and innovation.</p>

               <p>NOw let any discreet man consider, what further evidence he can desire, or peradventure, what greater assurance nature can afford, and not be of an awkward wilfulnesse to aske, that which is not conformable to the lawes of nature? Much like unto him, who being sate in a chaire far from the chimney, could not think of applying himselfe to the fire, but was angry the fire and chimney were made so far from him. The Phylosophers say, it is <hi>indisciplinati ingenii</hi> to expect in any Art or Science more exactnesse then the nature of it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth. As if a man would bind a Seaman, to goe so far every day, whether wind and weather served or no: So in morall matters, and such as are subject to humane action, we must expect such assurance as humane actions beare. If for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of your spirituall life, you have as much as for the managing of your naturall and civill life, what can you expect more? Two or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of men, beyond exception, will cast a man out of, not onely his lands, but life and all. He that amongst Merchants will not adventure, when there is a hundred to one of gaining well, will be accompted a silly Factor. And amongst Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, he that will feare danger where but one of a hundred is slaine, shall not escape the stain of Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardise. What then shall we expect in Religion, but to see a maine advantage on the one side, we
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54903:39"/>
may cast our selves on? and for the rest remem ber we are men, creatures subject to chance and mutability, and thank God he hath given us that assurance in a supernaturall way, which we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent withall, in our naturall and civill ventures and possessions, which neverthelesse God knoweth we often love better, and would lesse hazard then the unknowne good of the life to come. Yet perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, God hath provided better for his Church then for Nature, since he loved her more, and in his own Person did more for her. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore examine the assurance he hath left her parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly. It was found in the second Chapter, upon this principle, that so great a multitude of men as cleave to this ground (to have received their faith by tradition) could not conspire by lying, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their posterity. And if I be not deceived, this principle being granted, the conclusion (that this present Church is the true) followeth in as severe a way of discourse, as in <hi>Aristotles</hi> Organ is taught, and exemplified in <hi>Mathematicall</hi> Writers; whose use and art it is to put the like suppositions, whence to enduce something out against their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. As in the said Chapter you are bidden, to put what yeare, or age such an error entred, and it is evidently true, that if it be true, then that yeare or age conspired to tell alye to deceive their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity. And as for the strength of their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple it selfe (although no morall man can be so absurd as to doubt of it) yet may we consider, that the understanding being the part, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth man to be a man, and truth being the perfection

of our understanding, and true speech the effect, naturall to true knowledge, or understanding: It is cleare, that to speak truth is as naturall a fruit of mans nature, as Peares of a Peare tree, Grapes of a Vine, Hony of the Bee: and that it can be no lesse grafted in nature, for men to speak truly, then it is in any other naturall cause to yeeld the fruit, for whose sake nature bred the cause. Wherefore as the constancy of the effect sheweth, that it hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth upon eternall principles, that no one species of perfect creatures can perish, although we are not so skilfull of nature, as hansomely to weave the demonstration; so cannot it be doubted, but that if one had all the principles of mans nature well digested, he might demonstratively deduce the impossibility, of (that such multitudes of men should conspire to a lye) the variety of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, ever holding their being from a constancy and uniformity in the universall. Adde to this the notoriousnesse of the lye, such as he is rarely found, that is, so wicked as to venture upon; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the greatnesse of the subject, and of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ensuing upon himselfe, and his dearest pledges. The ground therefore assumed, is a demonstrative principle, and peradventure in a higher degree then most physicall principles be: For who knoweth not the nature of the soule, to be the highest thing Physicks can reach unto? Who knoweth not, that immateriall things are lesse subject to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability then those which are grounded in matter? Then as more noble, and as more immateriall, it hath greater exemption from mutability, then
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54903:40"/>
any other naturall cause whatsoever. One addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more, may chance to cleare the whole busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse more fully. Nothing more cleare then that, no naturall cause faileth of his effect, without there be some impediment from a stronger. Now the impediments which hinder a man from speaking truth, experience teacheth us, to be no other then hopes and feares. The same experience giveth us to know, that it is a rare thing, that hopes and feares should comprehend so great multitudes, as are in the union of the Catholique Church, specially during an age, which is the least time necessary for the effect we speak of, that what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure might at one time be ill admitted, should not be rejected at another. But if there were; can any man be so mad as to think, it could be a secret hope or feare, which should not break out amongst the posterity, and be knowen, that what was done was not true, but counterfeited upon feare or interest, which if it were, a whole ages counterfeiting would not be sufficient to make the posterity beleeve, they had received such a point of doctrine by tradition. Wherefore I doe not see, how this principle of tradition, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine received by it, can be accompted of lesse certainty, then any Physicall demonstration what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever; or Faith upon this ground not as sure as any naturall cause, as the course of Sunne and Moon, as the flowing and ebbing of the Sea, as the Summer and Winter, Sowing and Harvest, and whatsoever we undoubtedly presume upon the like nature, and kind.</p>

The principle which is taken in the following Chapter, is of no lesse force (if not of far better) to who rightly understandeth the nature of God his workes, whose course it is deeplier to root and strengthen those things which he would have most to flourish, or whereof he hath most care. Now Christians well know, that God Almighty hath made mankind for his elect, as the world which is about us for mankind. And therefore he hath rooted those things which more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately belong to the Elect (as is his Church, his Faith, and Holy Spirit in it) more strongly then the principles either of mans nature, or of the world which was made for it: himselfe assuring us of it, when he told us, <hi>One title should not misse of the holy Writ, though Heaven and Earth should be dissolved.</hi> And so seeing the latter principle, relyed upon the not failing of Gods Holy Spirit to his Church, which should ever watch upon their actions, that nothing should creep into Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian life, which persently the zeale of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full should not startle at. I think it needlesse to seek to further <hi>qualifie</hi> the strength of that part, which receiveth it from the quality of so good a workman as was the Holy Ghost.</p>

               <p>I Doubt not but whosoever shall have received sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in the discourse passed, will also have received in that point we seeke after; that is in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing assured both that Christ hath left a Director in the world, and where to find him, there being left no doubt, but it is his holy Church upon earth. Nor can there be any question, which is this Church, sithence there is but one that doth and can lay claime, to have received from hand to hand his holy doctrine in writings and hearts. Others may cry loud, they have found it, but they must first confesse it was lost: and so if they have, it was not received by hands, I meane, as far as it disagreeth with Catholique doctrine; so that where there is not so much as claime, there can be no dispute. And that this Church is a lawfull directresse, that is, hath the conditions requisite, I think can no wayes be doubted. Let us consider in her, presence, or visibility, authority, power. As for the first, her multitude and succession, makes the Church if she is ever accessible, ever knowen. The <hi>Arrians</hi> seemed to chase her out of the world in their flourish, but the persecution moved against her, made her even then well known and admired. In our owne Countrey we have seen no Bishop, no forme of Church for many yeares; yet never so, but that the course of justice did proclaime her through <hi>England,</hi> and who was
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54903:42"/>
curious could never want meanes to come to know her confession of faith what it is, and upon what it is grounded. Wheresoever she is, if in peace, her Majesty and Ceremonies in all her actions, make her spectable and admired. If in war, she never wanteth Champions to maintain her, and the very heat of her adversaries, makes her known to such as are desirous to understand the truth of a matter so important, as is the eternall welfare of our soule.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Authority:</hi> her very claime of antiquity and succession (to have been that Church which received her beginning from Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and never forewent it, but hath ever main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it) giveth a great reverence unto her amongst those, who beleeve her, and amongst those, who with indifferency and love of truth, seek to inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; a great prejudice above others: For it draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a greater likelyhood of truth, then others have. And if it be true, it carrieth an infinite authority with it, of Bishops, Doctors, Martyrs, Saints, miracles, learning, wisedome, venerable antiquity, and the like: that if a prudent man should sit with himselfe and consider, that if he were to chuse what kind of one he would have it, to carry away the hearts of men towards the admiration and love of God Almighty, he could find nothing wanting in this, that could be maintained with the fluxibility of nature. For to say, he would have no wicked men in it, were to say, he would have it made of Angels and not of Men.</p>
               <p>There remaineth <hi>Power:</hi> the which no man
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54903:42"/>
can doubt but Christ hath given it most ample, who considereth his words so often repeated to his Apostles. But (abstracting from that) who doth not see, that the Church hath the nature and proportion of ones Country, unto every one? As in a mans Country, he hath Father, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Brothers, Sisters, Kinsfolkes, Allyes, Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and Country-men, which anciently were called <hi>Cives,</hi> or <hi>Concives,</hi> and of these are made his Country; so in the Church findeth he in way of spirituall instruction and education, all these degrees neerer and farther off, untill he come unto that furthermost of being, of all united under the universall Government of Christ his Vicar: And as he in his Countrey findeth bearing, breeding, settling in estates and fortunes, and lastly protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and security; so likewise in the way of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity doth he find this more fully in the Church: so that if it be true, that a man oweth more unto his Master then unto his Father, because <hi>bene esse</hi> is better then <hi>esse:</hi> certainly a man also (as far as Church and Country can be separated) must owe more to the Church then to his very Country; wherefore likewise the power which the Church hath to command and instruct, is greater then the power of the temporall Country, and community, whereof he is part; Againe, this Church can sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie learned and unlearned. For in matters above the reach of reason, whose source and spring is from what Christ and his Apostles taught, what learned man, that understands the nature of science and method, can refuse in his inmost soule to bow
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54903:43"/>
to that which is testified by so great a multitude, to have come from Christ? And what unlearned man can require more for his faith, then to be taught by a Mistresse of so many prerogatives and advantages above all others? Or how can he think to be quieted in conscience, if he be not content to fare as she doth, who hath this prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, evident that none is so likely by thousands of degrees.</p>

               <p>THe stemme and body of our position thus raised, will of it selfe shoot out the branches of divers Questions, or rather the solution thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And first,</hi> How it hapned that diverse Heretiques have pretended tradition (the <hi>Millenarians, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocratians, Gnostiaks,</hi> and divers others) yet they with their traditions have been rejected, and the holy Church left onely in claime of tradition?</p>
               <p>For if we look into, what Catholique tradition is, and what the said Heretiques pretended, under the name of Tradition, the question will remain voided. For the Catholique Church calleth Tradition, that doctrine which was publikely preached in the Churches, ordred and planted in the manners and customes of the Church. The Heretiques called Tradition a kind of secret do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, either gathered out of private conversation with the Apostles, or rather they pretended that the Apostles, besides what they publikely taught
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54903:43"/>
the world, had another private or mysticall way proper to Schollers, more endeared then the rest, which came not to publike view, but was in hug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>germugger delivered from those secret Disciples unto others, and so unto them; where it is easily seen, what difference there is betwixt this Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Tradition and this pretended. For (the force and energie of tradition residing in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of hearers, and being planted in the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall action, and life of Christians, so that it must have such a publicity that it cannot be unknown amongst them.) Those the Heretiques pretend both manifestly, want the life and being of tradi tions, and by the very great report of them lose all authority and name. For, suppose some pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate doctrine of an Apostle to some Disciple, should be published and recorded by that Disciple, and some others, this might well be a truth, but would never obtain the force of a Catholique po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, that is, such as it should be damnation to reject, because the descent from the Apostle is not notorious, and fitting to sway the body of the whole Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Second Question may be,</hi> How it commeth to passe, that something which at first bindeth not the Churches beleef, afterward commeth to bind it? For if it were ever a Tradition it must ever be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, and bind the Church: And if once it were not, it appeareth not how ever it could come to be; for if this age, (for example) hath it not, how can it deliver it over to the next age that followeth?</p>
               <p>But if we consider, that the hope of Christian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54903:44"/>
being great, and the Apostles preaching in so great varietie of Countries, it might happen some point in one Countrie to have been lesse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, or peradventure not preached at all, which in another was often preached, and well both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood and retained; we may easily free our selves from these brambles. For the Spirit of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion residing in this, that the testimony of that, <hi>the</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apostles delivered this Doctrine</hi> be <hi>exceptione majus,</hi> and beyond all danger of deceit; It is not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the efficaciousness of Tradition, that the whole universall Church be witnesse to such a truth, but so great a part as could be a Warrant against mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staking and deceit; so that if all the Churches of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> or <hi>Greece,</hi> or <hi>Aphrique,</hi> or <hi>Egypt,</hi> should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly affirm such a Doctrine to have been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto them by the Apostles, it were enough to make a Doctrine <hi>exceptione majorem:</hi> Whence it insueth that if in a meeting of the Universall Church it were found that such a part had such a Tradition, concerning some matter, whereof the rest either had no knowledge or no certainty, such a Doctrine would passe into a necessary bond in the whole Church, which before was either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known or doubted of in some part thereof. A likely example thereof might be in the Canonicall bookes, the which being written some to one Church, and some to another, by little and little were spread from those Churches unto others, and so some sooner, some later, received into the constant beleife of the Catholique world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:54903:44"/>
                  <hi>The Third question may be,</hi> How (Christian religion, consisting in so many points) it is possible to be kept incorrupted by tradition, the which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on memory, and our memory being so fraile, and subject to variation, it seemeth, cannot without manifest miracle, conserve so great diversity of points unchanged, for so many ages?</p>
               <p>But if we consider, that Faith is a Science, and Science a thing whose parts are so connexed, that if one be false, all must needs be false, we shall easily see that contrarily; the multitude of divers points is a conservation the one to the other. For, if one be certaine, it of it selfe is able to bring us to the right in another, whereof we doubt. And as in a mans body, if he wanteth one member, or the operation of it, he must needs find the want of it in another: And as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth that is well ordained, cannot misse any office or part, without the redounding of the dessect upon the whole, or some other part; so a Christian, being an essence instituted by God, as specially as any naturall creature, hath not the parts of his faith and action by accident and chance knitted together, but all parts by a naturall order, and will of the Maker, ordred for the conservation of the most inward essence, which is the charity we owe to God, and our Neighbour. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christian life and action consisteth but upon one main tradition, whose parts be those particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which men specifie, either in matter of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe or Action: So that this connextion of its parts amongst themselves, added to the Spirit
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54903:45"/>
of God, ever conserving zeale in the heart of his Church, with those helpes also of nature (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we see wonders in this kind done) will shew this conservation to be so far from impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility, that it will appeare a most con-naturall and fitting thing. Let us but consider, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant nations, their language, their habits, their manners of sacrificing, eating, generally living; how long it doth continne amongst them. See that forlorne nation of <hi>Jewes,</hi> how constantly it maintaineth the Scripture? how obstinately their errors? The <hi>Arabians</hi> of the desert, from <hi>Ismael</hi> his time unto this day, live in families, wandring about the desert. Where Christians labour to convert Idolaters, they find the maine and onely argument for their errors, that they received them from their fore-fathers, and will not quit them. The King of <hi>Socotora,</hi> thinking to please the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals</hi> by reducing a nation, that had the name of Christians, to true Christianity, he found them obstinately protest unto him, that they would sooner lose their lives, then part with the religion their Ancestors had left them. The <hi>Maronites,</hi> a small handfull of people, amongst <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Heretiques,</hi> to this day have maintained their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in <hi>Siria.</hi> And certainly thousands of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of this kind may be collected in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Countries; especially, if they be either rude, and such as mingle not with others, or such as be wise, and out of wisedome seek to maintaine their ancient beleefe. And Catholiques are of both natures: For they have strict commands,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54903:45"/>
not to come to the Ceremonies and Rites of other religions, and in their own, they have all meanes imaginable to affect them to it, and conserve a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and zeale towards it.</p>

               <p>TO come at length to the principall aime of this Treatise, that is, to give an answer to him that demandeth a guide at my hands. I remit him to the moderne present visible Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that is, her, who is in an externe sensible commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the externe sensible Clergy of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the externe sensible Head and Pastour of the Church. If he aske me now, how he shall know her? (I suppose he meaneth, how he should know her to be the true) I must contreinterrogate him, who he is? that is, in whose name he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth? Is he an ignorant man? Is he unlearned? yet of good understanding in the world? Is he a Scholler? and what Scholler? A Gramarian, whose understanding hath no other helpe then of languages? Is he a Phylosopher? Is he a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine? (I meane an Academicall one, for a true Divine is to teach, not to aske this question:) Is he a Statesman? For he who can think one answer, can or ought be made to all these; may likewise expect, that a round bowle may stop a square hole, or one cause produce all effects, and hang lead at his heels to fly withall. Yet I deny not, but all these must have the same guide,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54903:46"/>
though they are to be assured of, that in divers sorts and manners. If therefore the ignorant man speaketh, I will shew him in the Church of God an excellencie in decencie, Majestie of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies above all other Sects and Religions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by dull capacities are sweetly ensnared, to beleeve the truth they hear, from whom they see to have the outward Signs of vertue and devotion. If the unlearned ask; I shew him the claim of Antiquitie, the multitude, the advantages of sanctity and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the justifiableness of the cause, how the world was once in this accord, and those who opposed, when they first parted, first began the Schism; how the points of difference be such as on the Catholike side help devotion, and on the contrary diminish the same, and such like sensible differences which will clearly shew a main advantage on the Catholike side, which is the proportionall motive to his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding: To the Grammarian I will give two <hi>Memorandums.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, that seeing Catholiques were first in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session both of the Scriptures and the interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the adverse part is bound to bring such places as can receive no probable Exposition by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes. It is not sufficient that their Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions seem good or better; that is, more confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable unto the Text, but they must be evincent, to which no so sound answer, even with some impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety can be given. For who knoweth not, that is conversant in Criticks, how many obscure, and difficult places occurre in most plain Authors: and the Scripture of all Books (the greater part of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54903:46"/>
the men who wrote them, specially the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being not eloquent, and writing not in their native tongue) for the most part are subject to many Improprieties.</p>
               <p>The other <hi>Memorandum</hi> is, That to prove a Catholike point by Scripture, it is sufficient that the place brought, do bear the Explication the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike beareth, and if it be more probable by the very letter, it is an evincent place. The reason is, Because the Question being about a Christian Law, the Axioms of the Jurists taketh place that <hi>Consuetudo optima interpres Legis.</hi> So that if it be manifest that Christian practise (which was before the controversie) be for the one sense, and the words be tolerable, no force of Grammar can prevail to equalize this advantage. The Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian therefore who will observe these rules, I turn him loose to the Scriptures, and Fathers to seek in them what is the faith of Christ, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of his Church to know her by. Of the the Philosopher I exact to go like a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, and to search out the specificall differences of every Sect, and when he hath found them, <hi>if any one but the Catholike hath any rule of Faith and good life:</hi> which I remit to him to enquire? But at least when he hath found the Catholiques to be this claim of Tradition before declared, then, if this doe not bring him as demonstratively, as he knoweth any conclusion in Philosophie, and Mathematicks, to the notice that this is the only true Church of Christ, for my part I shall quit him before, God and man. The Divine if he hath tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54903:47"/>
understood the principles of his Faith in the nature of a Divine (I mean, <hi>Trinity, Incarnation, Redemption, Eucharist, Beatitude,</hi> the <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Dissolution</hi> of the World) and hath seen the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act conformitie with the deepest principles of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with an unspeakable wisedome of the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: If he does not plainly confesse it was above the nature of man to frame the Catholike Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and seeth not that onely, that is conformable to nature and it selfe; I say, he hath no ground suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to be of it. At last, the Statesman who is truly informed of the Church, (how far it is really of Christs Institution, and what either pious men have added, or peradventure, ambitious men encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,) If he does not find a government of so high and Exotick strain, that neither mans wit would dare to have attempted it, neither mans power could possibly have effected it. If he findeth not eminent helpes, and no disadvantage to the temporall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, I shall think there wanteth one Star in the Heaven of the Church, to direct these Sages to <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> But if God Almighty hath in all sorts and manners provided his Church, that she may enlighten every man in his way, which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the way of a man; then let every man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, which is the fit way for himselfe, and what in other matters of that way he accomptech evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And, if there be no interest in his soule, to make him loath to beleeve, what in another matter of the like nature he would not stick at, or heavy to practise what he seeth clearly enough, I feare not his choice; but if God send him time
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54903:47"/>
and meanes to prosecute his search any indifferent while, it is long ago known of what religion he is to be of</p>

               <head>After this followeth no order of Chapters, because it is applied to the discourse which was occasion of it.</head>
               <p>Although if what is already be not satisfaction unto the writing, and the Author thereof, (for whose sake and contentment, all that hath been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed hitherto, hath been set down:) I confesse, that I have not ability to give him satisfaction: yet least it should be interpreted neglect, If I did not make an application of it unto the writing, I shall as breifly as I can, for avoiding tedious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, runne over the discourse. And true it is, speaking of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as this day it is the true Church of God: I answer the doubter, she neither hath, nor can have any error, which he need to feare, and be shye of. The which two limitations I adde, for avoiding questions, impertinent to our discourse. The first, for those which are concerning the connection of the Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> to the universall Church. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to avoid such questions as touch that point, whether the Church may erre, in any Phyloso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall or other such like matter? which questi ons are not so pertinent to our matter.</p>
               <p>Neither doe I remit the Questioner unto Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for his satisfaction, although I hold Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54903:48"/>
a very sufficient meanes, to satisfie the man, who goeth to it with that preparation of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and will, which is meet and required. Howsoever this I may answer, for them who prove it out of Scripture, that because they dispute against them who admit of Scripture, and deny the authority of the Church, if they can convince it, they doe well; though they will not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves admit generally of a proofe out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as not able to prove every thing in <hi>foro con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentioso.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That they say, the Church is made infallible, that we may have some guide, I think it very rationall. For nature hath given ever some strong and uncontroulable principle in all natures to guide the rest. The Common-wealth hath a Governour not questionable, our understanding hath some principles, which she cannot judge, but by them judgeth of all other verities. If there should not be some such principle in the Church, it were the onely maimed thing God had created; and maimed in its principall part, in the very head. And if there be such a principle, the whole Church is infallible by that, as the whole man seeth by his eyes, toucheth by his hands. Neither can I deny, but that the Author well excepteth, or assumeth, that there is no lesse necessity, the Church should be known to be infallible, or which is this Church, then that there is one. For if I should admit absolutely, that it is necessary for every man to know the Church is Infallible, precedently to the knowledge of which is the true Church, I should
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54903:48"/>
forget what I had before said, that satisfaction is to be given to every one, according to his capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. It is sufficient for a Childe to beleeve his Parents, for a Clown to beleeve his Preacher, about the Churches Infallibility. For Faith is given to mankind, to be a meanes to him of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, and living like a Christian: and so he hath this second, it is not much matter in what termes he be with the first. The good women and Clownes in <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> trouble not themselves to seek the grounds of their faith, but with a Christian simplicity, seek to live according unto that their Preachers tell them; and without question, by perseverance, come to the happinesse, great Clearks by too much speculation may faile of. Such therefore know no otherwise the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Church, then because she telleth it them, to whom they give credit, as innocently as any child to his Mother.</p>
               <p>The Church therfore was made infallible, because so it was fitting for her Maker, so it was fitting for her selfe, so it was fit for that part of mankind, that had more refined wits; not because it was necessary for every one which was to come to her, or live in her, whereof the greatest part first commeth to her, drawn by some of the meanes before delivered, and beleeveth her about her infallibility.</p>
               <p>Neither doe I remit him to a generall and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant tradition, as if himselfe should climbe up every age by learned Writers, and find it in every one. I take it to be impossible. Testimonies
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54903:49"/>
one may find in many ages, but such as will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate and convince, a full tradition, I much doubt. Neither doe I find by experience, that who will draw a man by a rope or chain, giveth him the whole rope or chaine into his hands, but onely one end of it, unto which if he cleave hard, he shall be drawn which way the rope is carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Tradition is a long chaine, every generation or delivery from father to sonne, being a link in it. I send him therefore no further then to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent age, where he shall (beyond all doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) find that this doctrine was delivered unto this age, by the care of their Ancestors. And if we seek upon what termes, we find, that upon a fixed opinion of damnation in failing; and so, that they had received it so from their fore-fathers upon the same termes, with opinion that it had continued ever since Christ his time by this meanes. And he who is able to look into the meanes, how this can remaine constantly so many ages, may find it not onely the far securer, but an evidently infallible succession of doctrine, invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable as long as there is a Church. And this doth not onely shew that there is one, but which she is, and that there can be no other. For I suppose, no man will be so senselesse as to say, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles preached one thing in one part, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in another: wherefore it will be agreed, that once the Church agreed in her faith. This supposed, let us set the time when one part chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and will it not be evident, that the changing Church being challenged cannot plead, she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54903:49"/>
it from her Ancestors, because it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly false to both parties? Then must needs one onely Church remain with that claime. And although we did not know what the <hi>Greek</hi> Church doth by her History, yet the force of consequence would tell us, they cannot doe this which the Westerne Church doth, because the doing of one is incompatible with the doing of the same by the other.</p>
               <p>As for the two places concerning the Popes and Councels infallibility, it is not to my purpose to medle of them, because on the one side, the way I have begun, there is no need of those discourses; and on the other, I should engage my selfe in quarrels betwixt Catholique, and Catholique, obscure the matter I have taken in hand, and profit nothing in my hearers, more then to be judged, peradventure to have more learning then wisedome to governe it withall Wherefore I shall omit those Paragraphes, if I onely note concerning the tradition imposed upon <hi>Papius,</hi> that the very narration of it, sheweth that it is no tradition, in the sence we speak of tradition, but in the sence some Heretiques have pretended tradition; as it were a doctrine secretly delivered, and gathered out of private conference with the Apostles, and not their publique preaching delivered to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which is the way we exalt tradition in. The witnesses also of ancient Fathers are no parts of tradition, but signes and markes where it hath passed, whereas the body of tradition is in the life and beleife of the whole Church. For the Church
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54903:50"/>
(as I have said) is an essence composed, as it were, of interne and externe parts; the interne being faith, the externe, the outward action, which must needs be conformable to the internall faith, nor can there be a materiall change in the action, but it must argue the internall change of faith, nor inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall change in faith, but it must draw with it an Iliad of altered actions.</p>
               <p>As for the place of <hi>Fevardentius,</hi> which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth many Fathers to have fallen into errors, I thinke it will not trouble him, who is acquainted with the course of the present Church, wherein divers, who be thought great Divines, fall into errors, for which their bookes sometimes are hindred from the print, sometimes recalled, or some leaves commanded to be pasted up. The reason is, the multiplicity of Catholique doctrine, which doth not oblige a man to the knowledge of every part, but to the prompt subjection, to the instruction of the Church, wherefore many men may hold false doctrine inculpably, not knowing it to be such, even now after the learned labours of so many, that have strived to open and facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate by method, what is true and what is false; much more in the Fathers times, when there was great want of so many compilers, as theso latter ages have produced.</p>
               <p>As for the two points, he saith, avert him from Catholique doctrine, I am mistaken, if he be not mistaken in both. The first is, that Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique doctrine damnes all, who are not in the union of their Church. He thinketh the sentence hard,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54903:50"/>
yet, I thinke he will not deny me this, that if any Church does not say so, it cannot be the true Church: For call the Church what you will, the Congregation of the Elect, the Congregation of the Faithfull, the Congregation of Saints, or Just; call it, I say, or define it what you will, doth it not clearly follow, that whosoever is out of that Church cannot be saved; for he shall not be Elect, Just, Faithfull, &amp;c. without which there is no Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. How then can any Church maintaine these two propositions? I am the true Church, and yet one may be saved, without being in me. But peradventure he is scandalized, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church requireth actuall communion, externall with her, which he thinketh in some case may be wanting, without detriment of Salvation. But how would he have the Church speake, which speaketh in common, but abstracting from such particular cases, as may change wholly the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the question. For example sake; hath not the Church reason to say, he that denyeth the blessed Trinity is an Heretique? It hapneth, one who hath conversed among the <hi>Tritheites,</hi> hearing them use the word Trinity for three Gods, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to speak against them, denyeth there is any Trinity; shall this man be comprehended in the foresaid condemnation? Or was the sentence ill pronounced? Neither, as I think. For bo h was it well done by the Church, to condemne denyers of the Trinity, because <hi>per se loquendo</hi> (as the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers speak) that is, according to the ordinary course, and nature of things, who denyeth a thing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54903:51"/>
in words, denyeth it in heart; yet the man fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoken, did not so, and was not condemned in that sentence. In like manner, when the Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth all such as are not in actuall union, and communion with her, she doth well: because ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ordinary course, this doth not fall out, without either presumption, and damnable pride, or else culpable, eitherignorance, or feare, and love of private interest, before God and his Church. But it followeth not thence, that by accident no man may sometime be excused. The words of our Saviour concerning Baptisme and Eucharist their necessity, are very precise, yet the Church doubteth not to excuse those who have it in <hi>voto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to proceed unto the point. The corrent of Catholique Doctors holdeth, that no man shall be damned for infidelity, but he who wilfully doth mis-beleeve, and that to doe so, it is required that faith be sufficiently proposed unto him. And what is to be sufficiently proposed, is not determined amongst them. There wanteth not Divines, that teach, that even <hi>ignorantia affectata,</hi> doth excuse from Herisie.</p>
               <p>On the other side it is most certaine, that no man is damned for not professing, what he is not damned for not beleeving. Wherefore profession being that which engrafteth a man exteriorly in the Church of God, according unto the ordinary opinions of Catholiques; it followeth, that no man is condemned for not being of the Church, who is not for infidelity, for which it is a very
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54903:51"/>
uncertaine case, who be damned and who not. So that the Catholique position is not so crude, as peradventure the Author understood it to be, though the words be rough, and ought to be so, as being of what is according to the course of nature, not what chance and accideuts may invent.</p>
               <p>The other point was of puting Heretiques to death, which I think he understandeth to be done Vindicatively; not Medicinally. I meane imposed as a punishment, and not in way to prevent mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheife, or oppresse it in the head. If the <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellians</hi> were the first, that is ancient enough for the justification of the fact, although for banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (which also he seemeth to reprehend) we know the first that could suffer it, did suffer it. <hi>Arrius,</hi> I meane, by the hand of <hi>Constantine,</hi> whom he praiseth for a speech he uttered, before he knew the consequence of the danger, and seemeth to reprehend for his after and better wits. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> justifieth such proceeding against Here tiques. Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> advised the like against <hi>Pagans,</hi> (if I remember) and the Church laterly, hath rather increased then decreased in the practise of it. <hi>Mores's</hi> speech, I beleeve is mistaken, the force of it being, that the banishment of Bishops shewed his faith, because the banished were Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, which shewed <hi>Lucius</hi> to be none. But what can be said, if the Church useth that for the prevention of a greater, and more dangerous evill, which all politique Estates use for the remedies of lesse, and lesse dangerous evils, and are commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for it? For if Faith be the way of Salvation
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54903:52"/>
and hereby the bane of Faith; if Salvation be the greatest good, then the danger of a Countries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over runne with Heresie, is the greatest of dangers, greater then the multiplying of Theeves, greater then the unsurety of the wayes, greater then a Plague, or Invasion. Why then doth not reason force us to use the meanes to prevent it, which the same reason and experience, teacheth us to be most efficacious in this, and all other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious and gangrening maladies of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. I hope reason it selfe, and the zeale of the Author to his own and Countries Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will supply my shortnesse in this point. For supposing a Church be assured she is in the right, and that the doctrine preached by another, leadeth to damnation, I know not why <hi>Caipha's</hi> words should not be propheticall in this case, and that truly it doth not <hi>expedire,</hi> that <hi>unus mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riatur pro populo, &amp; non tota gens pereat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He urgeth afterwards against the unity of the Church, that it is none such as we brag off. And I confesse we brag of it, and thinke we have reason too. And if it please him to look into the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of our Country of <hi>England,</hi> and some Land of <hi>Barbarians,</hi> as <hi>Brasile,</hi> or such other, where they live without Law or Government. I thinke he will find, that our bragging is not without ground. For wherein is the difference betwixt a civill Government, and a barbarous Anarchie? Is it either, that in a civill Estate there be no quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, or amongst <hi>Barbarians</hi> there is no quiet. The former would prejudice our Courts and Justice,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54903:52"/>
the latter is impossible, even in nature. What is then the goodnesse of Government, but that in a well govern'd Country, there is a meanes to end quarrels, and in an Anarchy there can be no assured peace? This therefore is that we brag of, that amongst us, if any controversie rise, there is a way to end it, which is not amongst them who part from us. And secondly, that there is no assured agreement amongst those who are parted from us; for although to day they agree, there is no bond, nor tye, why to morrow they may not disagree. These two things we brag of, and I think the Author will not deny it. For he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth we all agree, in that the Church is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Mistresse. Then it is evident, that if in any controversie she interposeth her judgement, the controversie is ended. He likewise confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, that who part from us, have no such defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive authority amongst them, and that Scripture whereon they relie, hath not this vertue, to take up controversies clearly. Againe, I doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, most English men confesse a Trinity, the Incarnation, and Passion of our Saviour, but if to morrow, any one or more of them, light upon some book of an <hi>Arrian, Trinitarian,</hi> or other Sect, so wittily written, that he putteth probable solutions for the places of Scriptures, sheweth slight wayes, how our well-meaning fore-fathers may have slipped into such an error; what is there to retaine these men, from disagreeing with the rest of their brethern, and betake themselves to the <hi>Arrians:</hi> And when the heat is passed,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54903:53"/>
light upon some Rabbi, who shall cunningly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerate the absurdities (as he shall terme them) of the Trinity, Incarnation, Passion; say our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did strange things in vertue of some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation, and delivering these things so oratori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, that for a new heat these things shall seem more conformable, then his <hi>Arrianisme;</hi> what then shall hinder this to become a <hi>Jew,</hi> and at last to prove himselfe so great a Clerk, as to write <hi>De Tribus Impostoribus.</hi> Take away the power of the Church (which every man doth, who taketh away the Infallibility) what can retaine any man, why he should not yeeld to that discourse, which seemeth fairest, seeing nothing is certaine? But peradventure, some may attribute power unto the Church without Infallibility, whom I would have consider, but what himselfe saith. For his Church, by the power it hath, must either say, I command you to beleeve me, or I command you to professe this, whether you beleeve me or no. The second I think, no enemy of equivocation will admit, as the former is as much, as if it should say, I know not whether I say true or no, yet you must think I say true. So that if I understand any thing, where there is no Infallibility, there is no Power, where no Power, no Unity, where no Unity, no Entity, no Church. Now for the controversies mentioned (besides that, there is a meanes to terminate them) they be such, as bring no breach of the ancient life, and action of Christians, which all those Opinions doe, which for the most part are reputed to make Heretiques; That some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54903:53"/>
amongst us are not resolved, is a thing necessary amongst humane affaires, where things must have a time to be borne, to encrease, to fall; and the greater things are, the greater is their period. Wherefore I doe not see, why this may hurt the Church, more then the Suits which hang in our Courts, prejudice the Government of the Land. Neither can any other Church assume Infallibility to it selfe; because it cannot lay hold of this principle, that it receiveth its do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine by hands; and so must first professe the Church of Christ to be fallible, or else it cannot part from it.</p>
               <p>The last point of the Authors discourse, is, to shew how errors might have crept in. Wherein I shall have no opposition with him, for I doe not thinke the question is, how they should creep in, but how they should be kept out? For the fluxibility of humane nature is so great, that it is no wonder if errors should have crept in, the wayes being so many, but it is a great wonder of God, that none should have crept in. This neverthelesse I may say, (if the Author will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, (as I think) he will not deny, but that it is disputable, whether any error in sixteen ages hath crept in) this very thing is above nature. For if there were not an excellency beyond the nature of corruptible things, it would be undeniably e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, that not one or two, but hundreds of errors had quite changed the shape of the Church in so many yeares, tempests, divisions, want of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce in the body of the Church. But this one
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54903:54"/>
maxime, that she receiveth her Faith by Tradition, and not from Doctors, hath ever kept her entire. And he that will shew the contrary, must shew how it could come to passe, that those who lived in such an age, could say unto their children, this we received from our fore-fathers, as taught them by their fore-fathers, to have been received from Christ and his Apostles, from hand to hand; which if it could not be, the question is resolved, that no error is in the Church of God, which hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth her faith upon that tenure.</p>
               <p>And truly, if the Author desire to examine many Religions, let him look their main ground wherein they relye, and see whether that be good or no. And I thinke amongst Christians he shall find but two, Tradition, and Scripture. And the Catholique onely to relye upon Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and all the rest upon Scripture. And also shall he see, that relying upon Scripture cannot draw to an unity, those who relye upon it; and that more then one cannot relye upon Tradition, which when I have considered, I have no further to seeke, for if I will be a Christian, I must belong to one side. By falling on the one side, I see my fortune in thousands who have gone before me, to wit, that I shall be to seek all my life time, as I see they are, and how greatly they magnifie very weak peices. On the other side, I see every man who followeth it, as far as he follow it, is at quiet; and therefore cannot chuse, but think there to be the stone to rest my head upon, against which <hi>Jacob</hi> his Ladder is reared unto Heaven.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:54903:54"/>
               <p>The Author hath through his whole discourse, inserted divers things, which seem particularly to the justification of himselfe, in the way of his search. The which, as I think, on one side I should be too blame to exaimine (for who am I, to judge the Servant of another man) so, because I cannot think, but that they were inserted for love of truth, and to heare what might be said against them (craving pardon, if on presumption of that, it is his will, I any way offend) I shall touch the matter, wholly abstracting from the personall disposition of any man. And to begin a far of, it is confessed amongst Catholiques, that all sinne must be wilfull, and so as far as any mans doubt in Religion is not by will, but by force and necessity, so far it is not culpable, but may be laudable before God and man. As was without doubt the anxious search of Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> for the truth, which he relateth in his confessions, for who is assured of being out of the truth, must have time to seek it, and so long this doubt is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall, and laudable. That which must justifie this search, is in common, that which justifieth all actions, that a man be sure in the aime he aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at, and in the meanes he taketh, not to be governed by any passion, interest, or wilfulnesse, but that he sincerely aimeth, and carefully pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth in the search of the truth it selfe, for the love of it; and of those goods which depend of the knowledge of it. This is a thing, in which a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall man can have no other judge then himselfe; for no man knoweth what is within a man, but
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54903:55"/>
the Spirit, or conscience of man. But he himselfe must be a rigorous Judge unto himselfe, for it is very hard to know the truth: when I say rigorous, I mean exact, and fearfull mis-deeming: As holy <hi>Job</hi> was, who said, <hi>He was fearfull of all his actions.</hi> Holy <hi>David,</hi> but amongst all, Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> doth more sweetly complaine of the misery of man, not knowing his own dispositions, and yet he was then forty yeares of age, when passions and heates of youth which make this discussion harder, are generally settled. Besides this, he must have this care, that he seek what the nature of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject can yeeld, and not as those Physitians, who when they have promised no lesse then immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, can at last onely reach to some conservation of health, or youth, in some small degree. So I could wish the Author, to well assure himselfe first, that there is possible, an Infallibility, before he be too earnest, to be contented with nothing lesse. For what if humane nature should not be capable of so great a good, would he therefore think fitting to live without any Religion, because he could not get such a one as himselfe desired, though with more then a mans wish. Were it not rationall to see, whether amongst Religions, some one hath not such notable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages over the rest, as in reason it might seeme, humane nature might be contented withall Let him cast his accompts with the dearest things he hath, his own, or freinds lives, his estate, his hope of posterity, and see upon what termes of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage he is ready to venture all these, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54903:55"/>
to Religion, and see whether, if he doe not venture his soule upon the like, it be truly reason, or some other not confessed motive, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth him. For my own part, as I doubt not of an Infallibity, so I doubt not, but setting that aside, there be those excellencies found on the Catholique party, which may force a man to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it, and venture all he hath upon it, before all other Religions, and Sects in the world: Why then may not one, who after long searching fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no Infallibility, rest himselfe on the like, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing mans nature affordeth no better?</p>
               <p>Another thing may make a mans search faulty, and is carefully to be looked-unto, I meane, that it is easie for a man to mistake himselfe, by too much confidence in himselfe or others. He that will make a judgement in an Art he is not Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in, if he be deceived, is to impute it unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. The Phrase commandeth us to beleeve every man in his Art; he who knoweth and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth himselfe, beleeveth not. Therefore when we see Masters in an Art, we are not skilled in, oppose us, we may beleeve we are in the wrong: which will bred this resolution in the Author of the discourse, that if himselfe be not skilled all those wayes in which he pursueth his search, he must find himselfe obliged to seek Masters, who be both well skilled, and (the matter being subject to faction) also very honest and upright men, or else he doth not quit himselfe before God and man.</p>
               <p>I cannot part without one note more, which is, that it is not all one to incurre damnation for insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54903:56"/>
and to be in state of Salvation. For the man to whom infidelity is not imputed, may be in state of damnation, for other faults, as those were who having known God by his works, did not glorifie him as they ought: nay, they may be damned through want of Faith, and yet not be condemned for incredulity. As for example sake, if when they have sinned, they know not what meanes to take to have them forgiven, though they be without fault in not beleeving, neverthelesse dying without remission of sinne, they are not in state to come to life everlasting. As the man, who should venture into a Wood without a guide, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he did his best to have a guide, nothing lesse might fall out of his way, as well as he, who neglected the taking of one; so if God sent his Sonne to shew us the way of Salvation, and that be but one; as well is he like not to be saved, who never heard of such a way, as he that heard of it, and neglected it; for neither of the two goeth that way; and who goes not on the way, is not like to come to the end. I know God is good and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull; but I know his workes, as far as we know, are dispensed by the order of second causes; and where we see no second causes, we cannot presume of the effects. God is good and mercifull I know, and feedeth the Birds of the aire, and much more men; yet we see in dearths and hard winters, both men and Birds to perish, doe they what they could to get victuals. And how am I assured he will send Angels to illuminate such men as doe their endeavours, that their soules may not perish? But
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54903:56"/>
far more doe I doubt, whether ever man, who had not the way of Christ, or even of those, who wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in it, did ever doe his best (except some few, and very few, perhaps not two of Christ his greatest favourites) and was not so culpable, that his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition would not have been imputed unto himselse. God of his mercy put us in the score of those, of whom he saith, <hi>He will take pitty upon whom he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, and compassion of them he pleaseth.</hi>

               <p>To begin then with your Treatise, you can say nothing for Tradition, which I will not willingly
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54903:59"/>
allow, Scripture it self being a <hi>Traditum,</hi> and by that way comming to our knowledge, (for I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that those who would know it by the Spirit, run themselves into the same Circle between Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Spirit, out of which some of your side have but unsuccessefully laboured to get out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Scripture and Church) but that this way which you propound should be convenient to know what was Tradition at first, I can by no means a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. Which to consider the better, I will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all the strength of what you have said in a little room, and shut up your Oration into the compasse of some 3. Sillogismes; thus you argue,</p>
               <p>What company soever of Christians alone pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to teach nothing but what they have received from their Fathers, as received from theirs, as so come down from the Apostles, that company a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone must hold the truth.</p>
               <p>But that company of Christians which are in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> only pretend this, Therefore they alone hold the truth, and the Church.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> you prove thus:</p>
               <p>If such a company of Christians could teach falshoods, then (since it is granted that what was at first delivered was true) some age must either have erred in understanding their Ancestors, or have joyned to deceive their posterity.</p>
               <p>But neither of these are beleevable,</p>
               <p>Therefore neither is it beleevable, that such a company of Christians should teach falshoods:</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> you prove thus; (I mean that they
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54903:60"/>
alone pretend it, for that they, I mean all they, pretend it, you take for granted.)</p>
               <p>If it be incompatible with the Church of <hi>Romes</hi> doing it, that any else should doe it, then she does it alone.</p>
               <p>But it is incompatible, (which is denied, and not yet proved.)</p>
               <p>Therefore she doth it alone.</p>
               <p>The severall parts of this Argument, I mean first to Answer; and secondly, Whatsoever lyes scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd in your discourse any thing to this purpose, or any other unanswer'd in the first part: and thirdly, I will reply to those Answers which you have been pleased to make, to part of that Nothing which I writ, wishing that this last work might have bin longer, I mean that by answering it all, and in order, you had given me occasion to have dwelt more upon my Reply.</p>
               <p>Now if I doe not shew that all of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do not, nor cannot pretend this, that for two to pretend it is not incompatible (as having been so heretofore) that those who alone pretend this may pretend it falsely, that some men, and in time all may mistake their Ancestors, and have a mind in some cases to deceive their posterity, and that it is not necessary for a whole age at once to joyn in doing it, though it be done (if I say) I shew not this, then let me not bee beleeved, and if you can shew me that I have not shewed it, I will promise to beleeve you.</p>
               <p>First, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not, nor cannot pretend, that all their doctrine was received
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54903:60"/>
by them from their fathers as come down from the Apostles, it appeares, because when questions have risen about such things, whereof there was before no speech, yet if a Councell have determined them, they are received with the same assent, as if they had come from the Apostles; and they professe now the same readinesse to receive alwayes any such definition, though about a question now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; and it is likely, they have done what they professe they are ready to doe; at least, they shew, that yours is not the ground upon which they build. And I pray aske your selfe, whether those that teach the common people (who are the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of your Church) use to be askt about it by them, or use to tell them, that this they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from their Fathers, as descended from the Apostles, by a continuall verball Tradition. For suppose they told them, that [this Tradition tels us] yet they are not able to distinguish between such as is but Ecclesiasticall, and Apostolicall, or whether this be known to them onely by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, or from ancient bookes, and no such uncontinued line of teaching, and not rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them in generall to beleeve it, what by Arguments drawne from Scripture, what from reason, what from Fathers, Councels, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretals? I am not certaine what is their course, but I am sure, the most ordinary amongst the Ancients (whom they pretend to follow) was, that when they had told the people, that such a proposition was true, they added [neither is it I that say so, but the Apostle, the Prophet, or
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54903:61"/>
the Evangelist] and mentioned the place, where they thought such a doctrine was included, seldome speak of any verball Tradition (lesse of such a one, upon which you wholly rely) except urg'd to it, when that was impudently claim'd by some Heretique; and when they did (as the <hi>Asian</hi> Bishops about <hi>Easter, Justin Martir</hi> about the age of Christ, Saint <hi>Austine</hi> about commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating Infants, <hi>Papius</hi> and <hi>Iraeneus</hi> about the doctrine of the <hi>Chiliasts</hi>) then (as <hi>Lucian</hi> tels us, that when that Jugler <hi>Alexander</hi> sent to a City a Verse to be set upon their doores to keepe away the Plague, those houses which used the remedy, were more visited then those that did not so) those doctrines which the Fathers did grace by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting verball Tradition in their foreheads, were not lesse (perhaps more) apt to be after dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeved, then the other which were not in that kind taught.</p>
               <p>Now if the Ignorant be not expresly instructed, that upon this ground they are to think that true, which they are bid to beleeve (especially where their religion is easily enough received, onely for being that of their Country) you must allow, that the greatest part of your Church cannot, nor does not pretend, to have received all they beleeve under that Notion; and to know they did, you must have spoke with them all, or have heard them all instructed; for what is in some places so taught, may be delivered upon other grounds in the very next Parishes.</p>
               <p>From the Ignorant let us come to the learned,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54903:61"/>
and see whether they doe not both beleeve more, and require more to be beleeved, then hath had any such pedigree as you imagine. First, then the great, eloquent, and judicious Cardinall <hi>Perron,</hi> (whom I preferre so much before all those of his side that have been Authors, that [if a Pigmy may be allowed to measure Giants] I should think that the vast learning and industry of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and <hi>Baronius,</hi> might with most advantage to their party, and no disgrace to them, have been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in seeking quotations for his large and monstrous understanding to have employ'd them) he, I say, tels us, (and not from himselfe, but from Saint <hi>Austine</hi>) that the Trinity, Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, Free-will, and the Church, were never exactly disputed of, before the <hi>Arrians,</hi> the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatians,</hi> the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and the <hi>Donatists.</hi> Now (since without doubt the former ages disputed as well as they could, and so could not instruct their Proselites, better then they confuted their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries) I think it evident, that more hath since been concluded, then came from Tradition, and that the way you speak of, appeared not sufficient, either to Cardinall <hi>Perron,</hi> or Saint <hi>Austin.</hi> But because <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (being written in a more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall language) is more generally (though, I thinke unjustly) esteemed then <hi>Perron,</hi> I will aske you a question of him, when he excuseth Pope <hi>John</hi> the 22<hi rend="sup">t</hi>h for denying, that Saints enjoy the beatificall vision before the day of judgement (in which he was lead by a Troop of Fathers) because the Church had not then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54903:62"/>
the contrary; did <hi>Bellarmine</hi> beleeve, that then Christians had received from their Fathers, as from the Apostles, a direct contrary Tradition to his doctrine? If he did, how could he think the Pope, either possibly to be ignorant of it, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseable, if he stood against it? If not, then he thought our Age beholding to our Fathers, for finding out some truths, which had no such line to come down by; nay, which the Apostles either taught not, or but obscurely, and so as needs Arguments to deduce it out of their writings; at least, not so generally, but that a Pope, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more chiefe Doctors of the Church, knew not they had done so, (although you often put us in minde, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> tels us, how in that Church which he governed, the Apostles poured out all their doctrines with their blood) and in his time, Fathers taught not their children so: And this objectionlyes against you, as often as any of your side confesse any of the Ancients (accompted Orthodox) to have delivered any doctrine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that of the now Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which many of them often confesse, and your selfe doe not deny: for that they could not have done, if an uninterrupted verball Tradition had been then the onely rule of true doctrine, and they had known it to be so (for then they had a way of information, which you must confesse easie, since they might soon have known, whether generally, Christians had been taught the contrary, under such a Notion, and in such a degree, as you speak of) or the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had not since, either
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54903:62"/>
deviated from the tradition of one part, or intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced on the other.</p>
               <p>But because you knew, that the claime of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition could not serve your Churches turne, if any other different from yours made the same; you therefore affirme, that none doth, and prove it, because two cannot doe it; and in this you must give me leave to say, that you imitate the Philosopher, who made Arguments against Motion, though one walked before him; for though we see that the <hi>Greek</hi> Church does it as much as the <hi>Romane,</hi> (though apt to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the doing it, by the same wayes) yet you hope to perswade us beyond our eyes, by a reason, which indeed ends in an assertion: for, I pray, why may not two companies of Christians, both pretend to such a Tradition, (though opposing each other) as well as the <hi>Asian</hi> Churches and the <hi>Roman</hi> did long together, about the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Easter?</hi> But not onely that it may be so, but that it is so, you may find by <hi>Hieremy, Nilus,</hi> and <hi>Barlaam</hi> (who professe to stand to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, the ancient Tradition of their Fathers, and the seven first generall Councels, and they can be disprov'd no way, but by the same you may be so too) over and above the confessions of your own men.</p>
               <p>But suppose you did pretend, and alone pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to such a Tradition, yet you might falsely doe it: for I desire you to remember, that the Apostles delivered, as well Writings as verball Doctrine; and whatsoever the first ages thought
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54903:63"/>
to be contained there, that they might as well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver to their posterity, as taught them by the Apostles, as what they received by word of mouth; since we use to say, I learnt this of such a man, when we mean from his book, and though you strive to joyne verball Tradition in commission with Scripture, yet sure none of you can desire to thrust Scripture out quite from being at least a part of the Rule. Now that they might erre in interpreting their writings (and an error in the cheifest then, might easily cause a generall one since) I think you will not deny, especially since to say, that they left by Tradition every place of Scripture interpreted, would be an evidently false assertion: for how could the Fathers then have written upon it such differently-expounding Comments.</p>
               <p>Secondly, How shall it appeare, that there were not once two contrary Traditions claimed by two Parts (as the <hi>Asian</hi> Church, and the <hi>Roman,</hi> whereof, both it seemes claim'd a direct verball Tradition, because one pretended to have received theirs from Saint <hi>John,</hi> and the other, from Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> whereof there is no word in their workes) and that the erring Part did not prevaile? We know, out of the fifth of <hi>Eusebius</hi> History, that the fore-runners laid claime to Tradition, and nam'd the very Pope, that had chang'd the doctrine at <hi>Rome;</hi> which claime (how impudently soever) yet shewes, that men might joyne to deceive their Posterity, as pretending to a Tradition, when there was no such; for, if
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54903:63"/>
you say those were but few, I answer, both that you are not certaine of their number, and since so many may joyn, I pray, what number is it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Since you must and doe confesse, that some Doctrines, which were not once ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally witnessed to have been delivered by the Apostles, are now Doctrines of Faith (as the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> was rejected by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in Saint <hi>Hierom's</hi> time, though to her yee use to say, that <hi>Iraeneus</hi> would have every Church agree, and though Saint <hi>Hierom,</hi> whom you would prove to have thought <hi>Damafus</hi> infallible, when it is known, that he thought <hi>Libertius</hi> a Heretick, received it for all that) because you say, that these doctrines had so much Tradition as was <hi>exceptione major,</hi> beyond exception, (though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> thought not so then;) doth not this rest upon the Logick of those Ages, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude what Testimony is so? which might easily deceive them, especially since you confesse also, that particular Traditions may be false (as you instance in the <hi>Chiliasts</hi>) and yet the same reason, which perswaded some to receive them, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade more and more in severall times (and so no age need to joyne, as you suppose) and so a false Tradition may grow a generall one; as it seemes that of the <hi>Chiliasts</hi> (if it be one) did, so generall, that <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> sayes, in his time all Orthodox Christians held it.</p>
               <p>Besides, in those things which were beleeved very convenient, and which yet it was fear'd, that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54903:64"/>
unlesse men thought them necessary, they would be backward to practise, in respect of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of them to their dispositions, (as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession) how easie was it for them to be after taught, under paine of more danger, then at first they were delivered with? as Physitians often tell their Patients, unlesse they take such a Potion, from which they are very averse, they must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably die, though the not taking of it (even in their own opinions) would but make them lesse likely to recover. Some of great authority (moved by a good meaning) might thus deceive others; these, thus deceived, might deceive others; till, being generally spread, other good men, being loath to oppose them for the same reason, for which others desir'd to spread them, (as we saw <hi>Erasmus,</hi> who beleeved your confession, not to have been instituted by the Apostles, yet would not reprehend them that said so, thinking it an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, that would increase Piety) they be at last taken to have been commanded by the Apostles, without contradiction.</p>
               <p>Indeed all the waies, by which I shewd in that paper, which you vouchsafed to answer (which I desire not to repeat, to avoid both your being wearied, and my own, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) that errors might come to be generall; all those are waies, by which the same errors might come to be thought to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from Tradition. Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> agreeing in the sence of the sentence, which we read in the latter, <note n="*" place="margin">De Coroná.</note> 
                  <hi>Si legem nusquam</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:54903:64"/>
                  <hi>reperio, sequitur ut Traditio consuetudini morem hunc dederit, habiturum quandoque apostoli autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem ex interpretatione rationis;</hi> and it is the more strange, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> should allow any custome the authority of comming from the Apostles, since in the same place, he gives any man leave to beginne a custome, so it be good (which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon his reason, as the reception of it does upon theirs that follow him) and so make it a custome, in these words. <hi>Annon putas licere omni fideli concipere, &amp; constituere, duntaxat, quod Deo congruat, quod disciplinae conducat, quod saluti pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiat, dicente Domino cur non &amp; vobis ipsis quod justum est judicatis?</hi> By which it seemes, he was willing, more should be beleev'd then was first taught, and when that way had brought in any thing (for there is the same reason of opinion, as of actions) and made it common, then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Rule serves to rivet it in, under the false Notion of comming from the Apostles, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at least equall authority; neither can you except against this, as said by him when he was a Montanist, since your side useth to brag of this, and the like places, as making for them.</p>
               <p>To explaine my meaning the fuller, give me leave to consider one question, which shall be, the immaculate conception of the Blessed Virgin: In the first ages it is a thing granted, that many Fathers beleeved her, not onely not free from Originall sinne, but not even from Actuall; after <note place="margin">Wadd. Pag. 271.</note> this second question came to be more considered, and this first to be defin'd; but yet those of the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54903:65"/>
Affirmative opinion, cannot but grant to those of the Negative, that many Fathers sided with them (or else they were impudent Quoters, who claim three hundred) nay, even in Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Wadding p. 124.</note> his time, they confesse, that the Negative opinion was the more common doctrine; and yet see I pray, how things are altered? We have now a History of some Treaties, of two Kings of <hi>Spaine</hi> with two Popes, by two Embassadours to perswade them to define the Affirmative. The History is written by one <hi>Wadding</hi> an <hi>Irish-man,</hi> his Secretary, there I find, that the Bishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> (having Order from the Embassadour his Master to desire to presse, nay almost to tear a Definition from his Holinesse about it) tells him (and not falsely) that those who hold the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive are, <hi>Inter Catholicos soli &amp; pauci unius insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuti viri, &amp; unus &amp; alter ab illis edocti,</hi> but a few <note place="margin">Page 97.</note> of one onely Order, and one or two of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples.

                  <hi>quàm universa docet Ecclesia,</hi> they differ from the Doctrine of the Universall Church: If then an opinion for which nothing is to be said out of Antiquitie, and much against it, which was even lately, the lesse common opinion, could grow to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54903:65"/>
be held by so great a multitude in so high a degree, in so short a time, that the much greater part of the Church should now presse to have it defin'd, and that so earnestly, that to remove the opposing Fathers out of the way, they make a confession very advantagious to us Hereticks, that many <note place="margin">Page 127.</note> things have been defin'd by their Church against many Fathers, you may easily see that Opinions may grow very generall, nay grow to claim Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in one Age that were unknown in another; for that they claim and prove only because of the the general reception in all Apostolicall Churches, <note place="margin">Page 275.</note> not of any such uninterrupted testimony of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to their Children, that so it hath been taught in all Ages.</p>
               <p>You may see then that all your Church goes not upon your grounds, since if they did so, many of it that stand for the Affirmative must pretend to them, and if they doe, then sure the Pope must have confessed them to be witnesses beyond excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and would accordingly have defin'd, if they doe not, then this certain way of yours, cannot keep false opinions out of a Church, which makes not that their Rule.</p>
               <p>You may also see that opinions first unknown, after but particular, may come not onely to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and to have Tradition claim'd for them, but even to be defin'd; since if a Generall Councell should now meet about this point, it is plain (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods immediate working to the contrary, of which you speak not) which would be defined, nay, I am confident, that as it is observed of the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54903:66"/>
                  <hi>Romans</hi> that they were twice as long in first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering <hi>Italy,</hi> as (after) all the world; and as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> tels us of one, who was wont to say, <hi>That he had first with much paines gotten a little estate, and after with little a great one;</hi> so it is a much more short, and easie work to bring this to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition, then it was before to bring it thus far on the way towards one.</p>
               <p>Which if it were brought (it being already almost defined, and ready to topple into a Doctrine neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to salvation, the contrary being forbidden to be either printed or publikely taught) then (if you forsake not your Religion) you must forsake the Principle, and joyn with <hi>Turnball,</hi> who tells us, That the Churches supreme definition of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith is the infallible word of God, and together. with the ancient Revelation made to the Prophets and Apostles makes up one Object, which is to be held by the Catholike Faith: By which it is plain, he thinks more may be reveal'd (and then must be held) then was to the Apostles and (by consequence) could be delivered by them, which is contrary to what you now say.</p>
               <p>And indeed the current of Writers of your own side either knew not this opinion and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of yours, or consideringly balk it; else they might save themselves and their Readers the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of writing, and reading such infinite Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: for though they speak often of Tradition, yet they thinke themselves bound to prove it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then by the pretence of your present Church; they pretend to receive it from the Ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54903:66"/>
(not, say they, that Verball Tradition hath in all Ages been taught to all men, to teach it their children, and that it never slept,) and you are the first whom I have met with, who build upon this; Indeed they know the Greeks have as much claim to such a one (in truth to any) as they, and if they should say with you, that it is incompatible for two to have it, the Greeks may as well argue upon those grounds, that the <hi>Romans</hi> claim it not, because they doe, as the <hi>Romans</hi> can, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> lay no claim to it, because their Church does. And indeed direct experience shewes that this is not, nor hath alwayes been the ground of Christians, that it is not (even amongst you) we see by those multitudes who cry out to have a Doctrine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined; which is so far from having any Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (much lesse your kind of one for it,) that they labour with little successe to shew that there is none against them, and make it plainly appear, that upon your grounds they build not, but prove out of Metaphoricall places of Scripture, some at most but probable reasons, and the Revelations of S. <hi>Bridget,</hi> which are contradicted by those of Saint <hi>Katharine,</hi> (so ill do your Saints agree in <note place="margin">Wadding p. 334.</note> heaven, that me thinks, we may bee forgiven, if we have some differences upon earth:) That this hath not been alwaies the way, we see by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Origen,</hi> who having been esteemed by all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, as almost a Prophet, no man in his time discovering that he taught contrary to what their Fathers had taught them, was yet condemned ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">Vincent Lir.</note> yeers after his decease, and his followers

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54903:67"/>
care not though it be beleev'd upon false induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, some as being ignorant that ever it was lesse generall (which before the late and happy resurrection of learning, the best read Persons of their time might. often be) how deceiving a way is yours, to discover what all ages have thought, by what now a part of the present teacheth, upon what pretence soever, which when you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, and not onelie that, what I have said may be, but by severall examples (whereof I will touch some) that so it is, and hath been, then I hope you will be so farre from expecting that I should be moved by your Arguments, that your selfe will wonder that ever you were.</p>
               <p>First then, that the <hi>Chiliasts</hi> are Hereticks, or your Church not infallible, which counts them so, is most certaine, and most plaine; and if you be in the right, and that she teacheth nothing, but what she hath received uninterruptedly downe from the Apostles, then they must alwaies have been esteemed so by Christians; whereas their doctrine is so farre from having any Tradition against it, that if anie opinion, whether contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, or uncontroverted (except that Scripture which never was doubted) may without blushing pretend to have that for it, it must be this of theirs. My Reasons are these:</p>
               <p>The Fathers of the purest Ages (who were the Apostles Disciples but once remov'd) did teach this, as receiv'd from them, who professed to have receiv'd it from the Apostles, and who seem'd to them witnesses beyond exception, that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54903:68"/>
they had done so, they being better Judges what credit they deserv'd, then after commers could possibly be.</p>
               <p>All other opinions, witnessed by any other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients to have Tradition, may have been by them mistaken to have been, so, out of Saint <hi>Austin's</hi> and <hi>Tertullian's</hi> rules: whereas for this, and for this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, are delivered the very words, which Christ us'd when he taught it.</p>
               <p>Of the most glorious and least infirme buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, which ever in my opinion was erected to the honour of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> Cardinall <hi>Perron</hi> was the Architect (I mean his book against King <hi>James</hi>) and that relies upon these two pillars, that whatsoever all the Fathers (he meanes, sure, that are extant) witnesse to be Tradition, and the doctrine of the Church, that must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd for the doctrine of those ages, and so rested upon: If these rules be not concluding, then the whole book being built upon them, necessarily becomes as unconsiderable for what he intended it, as <hi>Bevis</hi> or <hi>Tom Thumb:</hi> If they be, then this doctrine, which is now hereticall in your Churches beleife was the opinion of the Ancient Church. For if being taught by the Fathers of anie Age, none contradicting it, be sufficient, this all for above two Ages (and those the first) teach, not anie Father opposing it before <hi>Dionysius Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus</hi> (250. yeares after Christ at least) that we know, or Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> or Saint <hi>Austine</hi> knew and quoted: wherein I note, besides, that both these Fathers, either thought that no signe of the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54903:68"/>
opinion of the Church, or cared not though it were.</p>
               <p>And if Fathers speaking as witnesses will serve, let <hi>Pappias</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> be heard, and believ'd, who tels us it came to them from Christ by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball Tradition, and <hi>Justine Martir,</hi> who witnesseth that in his time all Orthodoxe Christians held it, and joynes the opposers with them who denied the Resurrection, and esteemes them among the Christians like the <hi>Sadduces</hi> among the <hi>Jewes:</hi> which proves that you have the same reason <hi>expal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lescere audito Ecclesiae nomine,</hi> to grow pale at the <note place="margin">Camp.</note> mention of the Ancient Church, (the nearest to the Apostles) as we have to start at that of two hundred years agoe, and to be asham'd of your <hi>Dionysius Alexandrinus,</hi> as wee of <hi>Luther:</hi> Thus that great <hi>Atlas</hi> of your Church hath helpt us to pull it down the samewaies, by which he intended to support it, and though he have best of any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone the burden of proving that to be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which is false, yet he must have confest, that either these are not proofes, or they prove against himself. And this advantage we have, that unlesse you prove your own infallibility (which you will never be able to do) in what point soever you confute us, that falls like a Pinacle without carrying all after it; whereas if we disprove any one of your Religion, we disprove consequently that infallibility, which is the foundation of it all: so that (like them who vse poison'd weapons) wheresoever we wound, we kill, but we are like those creatures, which must be killed all over, or
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54903:69"/>
else their other parts will remaine alive.</p>
               <p>Neither must you think that you have answer'd the <hi>Chillasts</hi> by tying them to the <hi>Carpocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> and the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> (which is but like <hi>Mezen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> his joyning <hi>Mortua corpora vivis,</hi> dead bodies to the living) since the opinions of the two latter, assoon as they were taught, made the teachers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Hereticks and were oppos'd by allmost all, whereas that of the first, found in above two ages, no resistance by any one known and esteemed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and the teachers of it were not onely parts, but principall ones of the Catholique Church, and such as ever have been, and are reputed Saints; though, by I know not what subtlety you dispence with your selves for departing from what doctrine was received from them as come down from the Apostles, and yet threaten us with damnation if we will not believe more improbable Tenets to be Tradition upon lesse Certificate. For as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <note place="margin">Ethicks.</note> Wine measures to buy with are great, and to sell by are small; so when you are to put a doctrine to us, how small a measure of Tradition would you have us take? one place of one Father, speaking but as a Doctor, seemes enough: but when you are to receive any from us, how large and mighty a measure will yet give you no satisfaction? Neither can I find out what it is by which you conclude, that their Tradition was gathered the Hereticall way from private discourse with the Apostles: <hi>Irenaeus</hi> indeed tells us, that <hi>Presbyteri meminerunt,</hi> one of which <hi>Pappias</hi> was, but not a word that it
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54903:69"/>
was deliver'd in secret, or the auditors but few, nor that others had not heard other disciples teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same doctrine; and me thinkes that if you had evinced what you desire (as you seem to me not to do, unlesse to affirm be to prove) it would make more against you; sure if from so small a ground as the word of one onely disciple, that he in private discourse was taught this by the Apostles, a false doctrine could so generally be received by all the first Doctors of the Christian Church, and that so long after <hi>Dionysius Alexandrinus</hi> had used his great Authority to destroy it: Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> was yet halfe afraid to write against it, as seeing how many Catholiques he should enrage against himselfe by it, as he testifies in his Proem to the eighteenth Book of his Comment upon <hi>Ifaiah;</hi> what suspitions must this raife in the mindes of those of your own party, least what they esteemed Tradition, had at first no greater a beginning, and no firmer foundation, but onely better fortune; for why might not the same disciple have cozn'd them from whom their beliefe is descended in twenty other things, as well as in this? and why not twenty as well as he? especially since you confesse some of your doctrine not to have had Vniversall Tradition, but onely Tradition enough; which if those Fathers did not think they had had, for this, they would never have receiv'd it, but have excepted against the Hereticall way of their delivery, if they had known that to be a private one, and a private one to be such, and if they were so deceived in this way, might not they,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54903:70"/>
and more have been so too in other points, and in time all?</p>
               <p>If you say (as it hath been said to me by one whose judgment I value, as much as any one of your Party) that if this opinion had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed had Tradition, it could never have been so to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally extinguish'd. I answer, that I affirm not, that it had, but onely that if the rules of your part be good and valid, then it had; I am sure it hath better colour to plead upon, then any of those other doctrines, which you impose upon us: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides although it had, yet when Doctors of great authority with the people, had won upon many, first not to think it Tradition, and then not true, and lastly their courage encreasing with their mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, (for Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> durst not call it) had made it accounted an Heresie, it is not strange that none should rise to oppose it; for by that time burning was come in fashion, which was a ready way to answer all objections, and end all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies, especiall Piety being grown more cold, and so men lesse apt to suffer for opinions, and the times more ignorant, and so men lesse able to examine what had beleeved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. But you who affirm, that your Church receives nothing, but what hath come to her by Verball Tradition down from the Apostles, must not onely destroy the Arguments, which prove this to have had Tradition, (which you, or any else will be never able to do) but must affirm, that the contrary hath such, which yet their most ancient opposers never pretended too, but
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:54903:70"/>
scoft at the opinion as rediculous and savouring of <hi>Judaisme,</hi> which as wise men, and as good Christians, as they, before them beleeved to be Orthodox.</p>
               <p>Let us next consider that controversie which more afflicted the Church, and for a longer time then any other, that between the <hi>Arrians</hi> and their Adversaries, and let us see, whether even against those there were any such Tradition as you speak of. First then I pray mark what Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lib. Con. R. Jac. Pag. 633.</note> confesseth, that an <hi>Arrian</hi> will be desirous to have his cause tried by those Authors we now have, which lived before the Question arose; for there, saith he, will be found the Son is the instrument of his Father, The Father commanded the Son, when things were to be made; the Father and the Son are <hi>aliud &amp; aliud,</hi> which who should at this day say, now the language of the Church is better examin'd, would be accompted an <hi>Arrian.</hi> Now though there be no reason for you to disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve so learned a Prelate in a matter of Fact (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially since <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) yet if you please to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consider those Authors seriously, if you have not mark't it before (as Praejudication blinds extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) you will then confesse it; Sure then if Fathers in the first ages taught their Children, that so they had receiv'd from theirs, as the doctrine of the Apostles, how could the chiefe Pillars of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity have been ignorant of it? or if they knew it, how would they ever have written so directly against their knowledge. For that answer which Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> gives (as Saint <hi>Austine</hi> to the <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:54903:71"/>
                  <hi>gians</hi>) that before <hi>Arrius</hi> arose, the Ecclesiasticall Writers spoke <hi>minus caute,</hi> with lesse circumspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though it brings some salve to the present ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, yet it is a weapon against Tradition in generall, for if through want of care the best and wisest men vs'd to contradict Tradition, (as you must grant they did) then sure much more likely, when they taught by word of mouth, when lesse care is alwaies us'd, then in Bookes, and how then can any age be sure, that by this reason (of <hi>minus caute loquuti sunt</hi>) their Ancestors have not mistaken their Fathers, and mislead their Posterity. Look but into <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and see but what he answers to what is brought against him out of <hi>Dionysius Alexandrinus,</hi> truly in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on when he strives to make it Catholique Doctrine, he doth it with no lesse pulling, and halling, then <hi>Sancta Clara</hi> useth to agree the articles of the English Church with the Tenets of the Roman. Consider what eighty Bishops, and those Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe, decreed against <hi>Paulus Samosatenus,</hi> and if you make it consent with <hi>Athanasius</hi> his Creed, I shall believe that you have discouer'd a way how to reconcile both Parts of a Contradiction: This I say, not as intending by it to prove the <hi>Arrian</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to be true, but that the contrary Party insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not upon your grounds, but drew their beliefe out of Scripture, for if there had been such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and constant Verball Tradition, the chiefe Christians would not through want of Caution have contradicted it, neither could <hi>Constantine,</hi> if it had been then as known a Part of the Christian
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54903:71"/>
Religion, as Christ's Resurrection, have ever so slightly esteemed the Question, when it first arose, neither would <hi>Alexander</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> have remain'd any while in sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, as <hi>Zozomen</hi> saith he did, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> but this being then a Question newly started and spoken of before but by Accidents, and so peradventure <hi>minus caute,</hi> (for the same Author saies, that they did <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) they were therefore faine to try it by Scripture, (esteeming Written Tradition, as sufficient a Rule, as Verball) as you may see by <hi>Constantine's</hi> own words at the Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> The Bookes of the Evangelists, and the Apostles, and the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Ancient Prophets teach us clearly what we are to think of the Divinity. Let us therefore out of these Divinity-inspir'd discourses, seek the solutions of our Questions, which being the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Proposition, and passing uncontradicted (which the Bishops would not have suffr'd it to do, if they had known yours to be so much the best, and most certaine way, and this so hazardous as you suppose) we have reason to believe that they for want of your direction made the Scripture their Rule, and sought out for Truth by the same way, that we damnable Hereticks do, and by that condemn'd the <hi>Arrians,</hi> as not having such a Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as you speak of, (or if they had, which is very unlikely) counting it so insufficient, as that they
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54903:72"/>
were not to conclude by that. Neither did onely that ancient, (and not yours) Councell, but even your own Modern ones shew, that they went upon other grounds, since to have had every Bishop askt what he receiv'd from his Teachers, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from theirs, as come downe from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, would sure have been the shortest way to find Truth, and if they had thought it the best too, it would have sav'd the Friers at Trent many a long dispute out of Scripture, Fathers, and Reason, and the Bishops many a weary sessron before any thing could be determined, or the Parties brought to agree. Besides there is another reason (if I may be pardon'd a little insisting upon my digression) which perswades me that your own Councels de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine not upon your grounds (that is) because sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a thousand Catholique Bishops meet and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine any thing, yet wee know it is not among you believ'd <hi>de Fide,</hi> without it be confirmed by the Pope; which shewes plainly enough, that you think not they went by such a Tradition, since of that eighty, so many persons from so many several Parts are witnesses beyond exception, according to your own grounds, and that their Infallibility is not thought to depend upon an Impossibility; that (in the matter of Fact what hath been taught under that Notion) they should either deceive, or be deceiv'd, but upon an infallible assistance of the Holy Ghost, which may be wanting to any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, whereof the Pope is no part, or of whose decrees he is no confirmer. Now to return to my proofes, that against the <hi>Arrians</hi> there was no such
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:54903:72"/>
Tradition as you speak of, (at least, that was the ground upon which they were condemned) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, if you please, that in that Epistle which <hi>Eusebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> of <hi>Caesarea</hi> writ to some <hi>Arrians</hi> after the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Nice,</hi> he saith, First, that they assented to the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> I answer, That I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve (or else he is not constant to his own reason) that he meant onely those words to be unwritten, which were in Scripture, neither themselves, nor equivalently, whereas he took <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to be in the Scripture in the latter sence: And that by written, he meant in the Scripture onely, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by what followes, that no divinely-inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red writing (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) using the <hi>Arrians</hi> Phrase, it was neither fitting to say nor teach them: Neither can you say that <hi>Eusebius</hi> being himself a secret <hi>Arrian</hi> prevaricated herein,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:54903:73"/>
for <hi>Theodoret</hi> makes this Epistle an Argument against them, which he would not have done, if either it had seem'd to him to say any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Catholique doctrine, or not to have oppos'd the contrary by a Catholique way, at least without giving his leader some Caution con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it.</p>
               <p>All which reasons move me to think, that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Christians had not been alwaies taught the contrary to <hi>Arrius's</hi> doctrine, but some one way, others the other, most neither, as having been onely spoken of upon occasions, and therefore me thinks you had better either say with the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, that the Truth was concluded (as <hi>Constantine</hi> said it should be) by Arguments from Scripture, or (as some of your own say of other points) that before the Councell it lay in <hi>Archivis Ecclesiae,</hi> in the Deskes of the Church, then claime such a Tradition for it, as appeares it can never be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended that it had.</p>
               <p>Let us consider but two opinions more:</p>
               <p>That Infants are not to receive the Eucharist, is now both the doctrine and practise of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but six hundred yeeres the Church us'd it; Saint <hi>Austine</hi> accounted it necessary at least in some sence of the word, if not absolutely (which last is most likely, because from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of that, which could not be receiv'd but by them who had received Baptisme, he, and <hi>Innocentius</hi> a Pope, prove the necessity of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme) and an Apostolicall Tradition. If
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54903:73"/>
therefore both these Ages had gone by your Rule, how comes this difference between their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Sacrament being the same it was, and the Children the same they were?</p>
               <p>This I may consider, and see if the same way that this Doctrine hath been altered, whether any other might not have received change?</p>
               <p>Next, that Saints are invocable, you must say, is Tradition taught from Father to Sonne, as deriv'd from the Apostles, if you will be constant to your own principle, now though I might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this, first by the many Fathers that beleeved, the <hi>Just</hi> not to be admitted to the Beatificall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion before the day of judgement (for upon this your side now grounds that) but to be kept in secretreceptacles, and by the long time which pass'd before this doctrine was condemn'd: Secondly, by the beginning of it, which was particular Doctors Hipotheticall prayers, with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and such conditionall clauses: And thirdly, by <hi>Nicephorus Calistus</hi> his Relation (who in this is a believable witnesse, because he allowes of your opinion) that prayers to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> were first brought into the publick Liturgie by one <hi>Petrus Gnapheus</hi> a Heretick, about five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares after Christ, yet I will rather chuse <note place="margin">Lib. 15. C. 28</note> to confute this by the confession of <hi>Sancta Clara</hi> out of <hi>Horantius,</hi> who to this objection, that <hi>sub Evangelio</hi> (which must mean when the Gospel was preacht) no such precept is extant, not <note place="margin">Pag. 271.</note> onely denies it not, but gives this reason for it,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:54903:74"/>
least the <hi>Pagans</hi> should-think themselves brought againe to the worshipping of Men instead of Gods: If upon this or any other reason this were not then taught, then have not all your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines such a Pedigree as you suppose, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it were, yet, howsoever it followes, that, some, at least, of the learned of your Church have not been taught that they have, or consequently that it is necessary they should have: Though it seemes to me little less then <hi>Montanisme</hi> to believe that any since (as it were a Paraclet) should perfect the doctrine which then was delivered by the Apostles: Neither can you answer that they speake onely of such a Precept, and of being extant, whereas they might teach it lawfull without giving any Precept, and they might have given such a Precept although not extant; for I should readily reply, that the reason they give why there is none such extant, shewes, that they mean there was none at all, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Precept, nor allowance, since the <hi>Pagans</hi> would have been scandaliz'd at its being accounted lawfull to worship men instead of Gods, although it were not commanded, and not a whit the lesse, whether that in after times were extant or not, which they could not foresee.</p>
               <p>The onelie answer which I am able to invent in your behalfe, is this, that though some of your particular doctrines have not such a Tradition, yet there being a Tradition that the Churches definitions are infallible, whatsoever she at any time defines, is then to be believed upon the strength of such a Tradition, and before did <hi>latere in causis</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:54903:74"/>
as Flowers do in Winter.</p>
               <p>Yet to this I may reply by desiring you to enter with me into some few considerations.</p>
               <p>First, If this were so, and that so much of Christian Religion depends upon the definitions of the Church, and our Reception of them, upon knowing alwaies which is she, and that such is her authority, can you perswade your selfe, that Christ sending his Apostles and Disciples to Preach the Gospel, and after four of them writing his Gospel, (which shewes if the Books be true to the title, that they writ all they preacht, at least that was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; for else they were not Gospels, but Parts of it) that they should not rather leave out any thing else, how important soever, then not have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied themselves about teaching us, that the Churches Definitions are a Rule of our Faith, and instructing us in Markes so proper to her, that we might never need to doubt, whether it be she that defines or no, and whether their not having done this, evince not in Reason that this your Doctrine is false?</p>
               <p>Secondly, I pray consider whether if there were any such continu'd Tradition about the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions of the Church, whether that must not also have taught, (or else have been to small pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) when it is that the Church hath defin'd: but yet that is a case not fully judged among you, For some hold, that the Church hath defin'd when a Councel hath, although unapproved by the Pope, which is denied by others.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Consider whether (supposing as was
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54903:75"/>
before suppos'd) it must not also have taught cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Notes to know the Church by: but yet <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tom.</hi> 13. Pag. 193.</note> about those you are not agreed, <hi>Salmeron</hi> putting Miracles among the false Signes of the Church, and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and many more among the True ones.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Consider whether the Church have an eternall spring of Doctrines within her, or but a finite number, and onely those which the Apostles preacht: and I believe you will pitch upon the latter. Not then to ask how they come to know them, nor, if you answer by Tradition, to ask you againe how come men then not to know (before a Definition) what it is they Preacht? for if the Bishops (of which a Councell is compounded) know it not now, how will they know it when they meet? I will desire to know why the Church will not at once teach us all she knowes, and not keep us in doubts, which she may resolve? and did the, Apostles teach their Doctrines to be lockt up, or taught to us? And then having considered this, you will find I believe, that the Church do with Doctrines, as Fathers with Estates, never give their Children all, that they may still have something to keep them in awe with; because if she should, she could never have after pretended a Power to end any new emergent controversie, keeping in secret what she knowes, any that ariseth, she may still pretend is endable by her.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Consider that it will appear but a shift, if you say that there is a Tradition that all the Churches Definitions be true, and so excuse the particular Doctrines, for otherwise having none,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54903:75"/>
and yet avoid giving us any Rules to know the Church by at all times, and answering those Questions, which must be ended before we can know at any time when she hath defin'd.</p>
               <p>Now I confesse if you had said Tradition teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the particular Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is so the Admiral ship, that we may know any other if it be of God's Fleet, because then it must follow her, that is, be subject to her decrees, &amp; theirs which joyn with her, this would have bin plainly to let me know your mind, and we might quickly have examin'd, whether there were any Tradition for the Church in this sence to be alwaies obeyed when she Teaches, and without you say this, you say nothing, and will never be able to give any such Note of the Church, as the ignorant may without blushing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to know it by: Because therefore I guesse, that when not I, but your Adversaries reasons (for I am but one of the worst transcribers of them) have driven you from your own Fort, you must retire to that of your friends, or like them which are drowning, you will rather catch at a Twigg, then sink: I will consider this Assertion, which I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you must lay hold of so far forth as to shew it to be indeed but an Assertion. That there hath no such Verbal Tradition (nor indeed any) come downe, seems to me for these reasons.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> by opposing the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that with many Bishops about the Rebaptiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, shewes sufficiently, that he and they knew of no such Tradition; and then in what Cave must it have lain hid, if the chiefe Doctor of that age was
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54903:76"/>
ignorant of it, and even his Adversaries claim'd it not? And that he knew no such, appears not onely by his Actions, but also by his words; for to them who claim'd Tradition for the particular point propos'd, (though none for the Authority of the Church proposing) he answers, if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Gospels, Epistles, or Acts, let it be observed, at one blow cutting off not onely that (for sure this authority of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is no way taught in the Scriptures) but all other unwritten Traditions, which Cardinal <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> thought most skilfull in that kind of Fence, was not able to ward, but <hi>Du Plesis</hi> objecting it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd no other answer, then that the opinion of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> was condemn'd, and that Tradition, although unwritten, maintain'd. Which answer though it be as far from befitting the Cardinall, as from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering the objection (since it is plaine, that this opinion was once held by such as were of chiefe estimation among the Orthodox, and consequently the contrary was not then the generall and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary doctrine of Christians, and the prevailing of the one since proves not the other false, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unfortunate, or the spreaders faulty) yet I confesse I excuse him, for as I have learnt from <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that it is ridiculous to expect a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration where the matter will beare but a probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, so would it be in me to expect even a probable solution of an Argument, the evidence of which will suffer none at all.</p>
               <p>Neither was he (I mean <hi>Cyprian</hi>) the first, that without blot of Heresie oppos'd the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54903:76"/>
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but that courage which he left to others after him, when they saw the Christian World joyne in counting him a Saint, and a Martyr, whom the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had stiled a false Christ, and a false Apostle, the same had he received by seeing that the <hi>Asian</hi> Bishop had also rejected, and oppos'd her Tradition; and yet <hi>Policrates</hi> ever had in great honour, and the rest ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver branded with the crime of Heresie; nay, even the more neighbouring Bishops, and who joyn'd with the Pope in the time of celebrating <hi>Easter</hi> (as <hi>Iraeneus</hi>) yet thought the difference not worth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, and for want of skill in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law, transgrest so farre as to reprehend for it, whereas if to that Church all else had been to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themselves, then <hi>Iraeneus</hi> ought therefore to have thought the matter of weight enough, because she thought it so, who were to small purpose made a Judge, if she were not as well enabled to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish between slight and materiall, as between False and Truth, though that it seemes she was not: for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> never refus'd their Communion before, though she knew them to hold the same opinion, and so (as plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares) counted that materiall in one Age, which she had not so esteemed in others, and therefore (in the degree at least of holding what she held) contradicted herself, and followed Traditions.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Cyprian</hi> imitated them, so did the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frican</hi> Bishop him, for a Question hapning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> about <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales,</hi> though they absolutely oppos'd him, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54903:77"/>
(in vaine I confesse) desired him that he would not bring into the Church <hi>Typhum hujus Saeculi,</hi> the swelling pride of this World, and though he laboured infinitely in the businesse <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that he might bring it to passe, yet he, and two of his successors were either so unready, or so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skil'd in the present <hi>Roman</hi> Doctrine, <hi>that Feed my sheeep, and thou art Peter,</hi> were either out of their knowledge, or out of their memory, and they alleadged, not any power <hi>jure divino,</hi> but onely pretended to a Cannon of the Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> which when the <hi>Affricans</hi> found not in their coppies, (for they would not believe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> so farre as to trust to hers, though now you gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally think the Scripture it selfe to have its authority <hi>quoad nos,</hi> onely for her definitions) they sent to the <hi>East</hi> to enquire there, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their coppies agreeing with theirs, they then more resolutely withstood the Pretence, which brought at that time nothing to the Popes, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse and shame.</p>
               <p>And indeed, not to object that it is not numbered among any of the ancient Herisies, that they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd from the particular <hi>Roman</hi> Church, nor is this Rule, of being sure at all times to joyne with her, ever given by those Fathers who set us waies and Antidotes how to secure our selves against Heresie, (which could not have been left undone if they had known any such Tradition) nor to speak of the Cannon of the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> which attributes the power of the Popes to the gift of their Fathers, and that againe to <hi>Romes</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:54903:77"/>
being the head City; setting all this aside, I will aske your selfe if it be not plain that those Fathers, who (upon the impudent pretence of some Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks) send men to severall places to enquire after Tradition, either send them to all the Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call churches, or (to save their labour) to that to which they were nearest, as esteeming them all of equall authority (though not jurisdiction) for I may say of <hi>Rome,</hi> and them, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> doth of <hi>Caelius</hi> and the other Commanders (<hi>Mutato nomine</hi>) the name onely chang'd) <hi>Pares jure, Roma audendo potentior,</hi> for what by watching all occasions to greaten her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <note place="margin">Pag. 208. and 687.</note> whereof Cardinal <hi>D' Ossat</hi> is my witnesse, what by abusing the respect all men had ever given her, in respect of the chiefe Apostles which founded her, of the Empire which was long seated in her, and of her ancient Bishops, whereof about thirtie together were martyr'd there, what by interpreting what was given to her Authority, as given to her Power, and taking civilities aud complements (of which no Court is now so full as the ancient Bishops were) made to Popes for alleagiance sworn to them, what by forging false decretall Epistles (which the Tearmed Authors of them would not forgive them for, if they knew it, if it were onely for the barbarous language) what by these, and such other waies, she is come at length to that passe, that what <hi>Auitus</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Generall said to the <hi>Ansibarians,</hi> who gave him reasons why he ought not in justice to disturbe their possessions, <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> 
                  <hi>Id Diis placitum, ut Arbitrium penes Romanos ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neret quid darent, quidve adimerent, neque alios Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices</hi>

               <p>Having ever marked Error and Confidence to keep so much company, that I seldome find the first, but I mistrust the second, makes me loath to affirme any thing over-dogmatically out of these objections, or say that they cannot be answered; Onely (because I must not offend against Truth, for feare of offending against Modesty) I will take leave to say, that if I could have answered them my selfe, I would not have put you to the trouble of doing it, which you might also have sav'd, if by letting me know your name, you would have enabled me to have found you out, and so in a short discourse have tried whether I could have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd that satisfaction from your words, which I must now expect from your Pen. But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing I had none of these objections, yet two things besides would have kept me from assenting to what you say: The first is, that your men, when they aske us how we know Scripture to be Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and this to be the sence of it, tell us withall, that unlesse we know it by some more infallible way then our owne Reason (they mean their Church) it will not serve for a beliefe of those things which are to be believ'd by a divine Faith; Now this Argument of yours upon which you
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54903:78"/>
build all, (allowing that it appear'd good reason) yet at most it is but reason, and liable to the same exceptions, unlesse the same thing be a wall when you leane upon it, and a bulrush when we doe. The second is, that all you say (for as yet you speak not of the Authority of the Particnlar Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> though you must at length come to it, though by that too little is to be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) if it were granted, would but prove those who adhere now to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be now in the right, but I asked for a guide, which might without new search serve me the next yeer, as well as this; For (for all that you have prov'd) she may leave the way you say she now pretends to walk in, and attempt to reform too, (which I wish were as probable as it is possible) or there may arise a schisme between two parts of those Churches which now adhere to the <hi>Roman,</hi> and both may claime Tradition, (for what hath been may be againe) and how shall I know then which side to take, since both will seem equally good by that Touchstone which you appoint me to try with. And if I be then sent to try by Ancient Writers, it is certaine, that (besides the fallibility of that way for the learned) this cannot be done at all by the ignorant, and it is probable that both Parties will fall into that absurdity, into which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> daily runs, which is, that although the evidence which she claimes by cannot well be exactlie read over in thirty yeares time, yet she requires us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der paine of Damnation to give our Verdicts for her by twenty yeeres old.</p>

               <p>I suppose this speech is directed at me who (as you <note place="margin">Resp.</note> conceive) take away all meanes, because I have no Judge; but I would faine know of you, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> have not left us meanes to know what they taught, although they have not left us any living infallible Judge to deliver us their doctrine verbally, or to expound their works: Or if you intended your Accent upon the word <hi>Asture,</hi> and if you mean by that some in fallible knowledge, I desire you (out of your own words) to consider whether humane nature be capable of it. For my part supposing as I doe, that his Faith is in a sufficient degree, which brings forth obedience, I require not any motives more, assuring (except form them who claime, that they cannot erre) then such as any man unpraepossest with passion or prejudice will beleeve sufficiently to obey; and such in my opinion are mine: For though I know, you count any way without a guide but groping in the dark, yet if God had not given us so much light as we desired, we must not therefore set up false lights, and because we would be sure to have a guide, make one our selves: But he seemes to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54903:79"/>
me, to have dealt with us in Religon not very un-analogically, to what he hath in the world, giving us two lights, Scripture, and Universall Tradition, whereof one gives light to the other, and both to us: Universall Tradition is our Guide to Scripture (as whatsoever else that guided us to we would receive, if there were any such thing) and Scripture is our way to God; By Universall Tradition we know much better, that these Books were written by Christs Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples (who are sufficient witnesses of what he taught) then the <hi>Aristotelians</hi> know that these were <hi>Aristotles</hi> works, or the <hi>Academicks</hi> knew <hi>Plato's,</hi> since Christians have both kept them with more care, and in the acceptance of them used more caution, as thinking them so much more important: In the Scripture I conceive, that (according to that rule, which I am sure I have either read in <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> or very often quoted out of him) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> all that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary is clear, or if any man that strives to square both his actions and opinions by that Rule, chance to fall into any error (for which his understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is onely in fault and not his will) it shall not hinder his rising to heaven: Such an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible way excludes, if not all use, at least all neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of an infallible guide, and is as good as a Judge to keep Unity in Charitie (which is onely need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) though not in opinions; and indeed since you must grant, that if any man mis-interpret the Councell of Trent, it shall not damne him, so he doubt not of its truth, desire to discover
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:54903:80"/>
what it meant, and be in a Propension of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, that when he knowes it, me thinkes (as <hi>Cineas</hi> told <hi>Pirrhus</hi>) you had as good doe that at first, which you must doe at last, that is, say the same with us at first concerning Scripture, which after much trouble, you are forced to say con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Councels, and in hard matters let the same implicite Faith in God serve, which serves in them, who can claime no authority but from, and under him: And (which is more then I affirme) that no man, but by his own, being wicked, can come into any error by false inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Scripture, see I pray, what Saint <hi>Austine</hi> saies in his forty ninth Sermon <hi>de Verbis Domini,</hi> that God hath so hedg'd in all-his own sayings, that whosoever would interpret any place of Scripture false, he that hath a: circumcised heart by reading what is before and after, may find that sence which the other would pervert.</p>
               <p>Yet if you can shew me reason to beleeve that there is any standing guide upon earth (and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reason it were unreasonable to hope to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade me to beleeve it) I will never be proud so much to my own cost, as rather to venture loosing my way by chusing it my selfe, then be beholding to him for directing me in it.</p>

                  <hi>of many errors among you is the multiplicity of Catholique Doctrines, which doth not oblige a man o the knowledge of every Part, but to a prompt sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Church.</hi> Truely if there be no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction between these two Propositions, I will confesse that I have hitherto mistaken what the word signifies, unlesse you mean, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle by teaching subjection to the Church indusive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, taught all that she teaches, and so what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered was short, but what implicitely, much; If this were so, certainely the Apostles, when they included almost all their doctrine in the subjection enjoyn'd to the Church, taught some certaine markes by which men might at all times know her, though you pretend to none but such as the <hi>Greeke</hi> Church as much claime (which is enough to scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the ignorant) and rightly too, as the <hi>Roman</hi> (as Antiquity, Succession, Miracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) excepting onely communion with the Pope, and splendor, whereof neither are proper markes of the true Church, that is such as can never be absent from her, since the Heresie of a Pope (which hath been, and is not by your owne whole Church held impossible) may take away the one way, and a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Persecution the other.</p>
               <p n="4">4 It appeares also by what you speake of the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate joines es of the descent, that you suppose if any errour come in, some one Age must joyn to teach it, which by no meanes followes, no more then one Age of them at <hi>Rome</hi> joyn'd to teach their Posterity <hi>Italian</hi> instead of <hi>Latine,</hi> but some may have taught a Doctrine to be probable in one Age, more then

Suppose that about the Question of what makes a Priest; a convocation of men had met (I mean of such who knew not what was taught in Bookes) before <hi>Luthers</hi> time (and what I say would be true in somewhat a lesse degree of this more instructed Age) what account could they have given what they had been taught when they were Children? Truely they could have said, we know it to be the custome for our Bishops to make Priests, and some of us have heard he onely is to make them, what is done and taught in other places we know not: Very far would they have been from all agreeing that they were taught when they were Children (as part of the ground of their hopes for all Eternity) by their Fathers, as receiv'd from their so as come down from the Apostles; that he is no Priest, to whom in expresse tearmes

a <hi>Mahumetan</hi> is as much instructed as most of them, and even his head-ship is ordinarily prov'd to them but out of some place of Scripture, out of which they hear his Infallibility concluded too, without being told the different degree in which those two Doctrines are to be held.

               <p>True it is, that very little is generally and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantlie taught in all ages to the people, and that which is seldome, is told them to have been so receiv'd from hand to hand by the verball Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition you speak of; and if they be at any time taught so, and remember it, yet they know not whether the next Curate teach the same, at least,

if under the same notion and degree of Necessitie: Indeed it would not be so intricate a worke (as now adaies it is) to be a Christian, if your way had been onely followed: but it is not this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but the writings of past Ages, which transmit to posteritie the opinions of the Doctors of past times, many of them being erroneous, and more unnecessarie; out of these works the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned learne, and teach againe in their workes, what the greater part (the unlearned) scarce ever heare of; out of these they settle the degrees your Doctrines are to be held in, some as probable, some true, some almost necessarie, some altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and teach concerning others, that some are false, some dangerous, some damnable, whereas the vulgar have seldome their meat so curiouslie joynted to them, but are told in generall for the most part (unlesse some publick opposition, or other occasion perswade them at some time to descend to teach them more particularlie) that this is so good, and this is not so: And indeed the degree in which the last Age held such an opni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is both most hard to know (not onely because the ignorant are seldom taught it by word of mouth, and the learned have seldome occasion, without some opposition, to explaine themselves so farre in their writings) but because also as many, and as considerable Persons not writing, as doe write, we cannot know by the Authors, what the whole Age thought true (except the acceptation of that Doctrine were a condition of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noin)
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54903:85"/>
and most necessarie to be known, because most of our controversies with your Church are as much, if not more, about the necessitie of her opinions, as about the truth of them: For we seeing plainlie, that in the purest ages many of the chiefest Doctors have contradicted some of her Tenets, without suspicion of Heresie, are not able to conceive how a doctrine should, from being indifferent in one age, become necessarie in another, and the contrarie from onely false Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall,</p>

This will appeare plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, if we consider the opinions of your Church by the Actions of her Head, in a notable and late Example. A great controversie being risen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and the <hi>Jesuites,</hi> it was heard before Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> let us see then what course he took to find which Part held the Truth, since he was not likely (especially in a time wherein, by being more opposed then usually, he had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to be consequently more cautious) to chuse a new way, by which truth was not wont to be found out by your side upon like occasions; Did he send for the wisest and best men from all, nay from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning Parts, to enquire of them what they had been taught by their Fathers, to have been recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by them uninterruptedly from the Apostles?
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:54903:86"/>
did he examine with which of them the first and purest ages sided? did he consider which opinion would make us have the more excellent conceit of God, and work most towards the expelling of Vice? None of all these were his course, but he appointed both sides, to prove which of them fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Saint <hi>Austine,</hi> and according to them, he intended to give sentence, if the advice of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Perron</hi> had not prevailed to the contrary: But many days they spent in examining what he thought, who thought so variously concerning it, that he scarce knew himself which, whereas before him all the Ancients that I could ever meet with, were with the Iesuites with an Vnanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and by them (if they must be tried by men as fallible as themselves) it would have better agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their own Principles to have had both Parts judged.</p>

               <p>See I pray how will you two agree? You say the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> receives, but what she claimes to be come down to her from the Apostles without interruption: He saith some of her Doctrines were long unknown, and came in by Revelations and Scripture; you say new Doctrines cannot come into a Church that, holds this Principle: He saith, Doctrines have come in by little and little: So either she held not allwaies this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, or for all that they might come in: To be short, all, which he hath said, seemes to me, as if he had purposely intended to frame a Ram to batter down that fortification, which you have built about the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>Now though he be of so great an Authority that he needs no backing, yet I will desire you to look into <hi>Alphonsus de Castro,</hi> where he speakes of Indulgences, and see if he mend the matter.

into the Church, yet would not have them contemned, because many things are known to after-commers, of which those ancient Writers were wholly ignorant.

               <p>The same Author in same place saies, that Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> durst not affirm the Assumption, but Saint <hi>Austine</hi> durst; and by that meanes, the Church perswaded by his reason believes it: Such a notable Tradition have all her opinions; for even this affirmation, which he confesseth, brought in this beliefe, is it self not now believed to be Saint <hi>Aust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines,</hi> for I take it, he must mean his tract of the Assumption, counted not his, by your own Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity-Criticks, the <hi>Lovaine</hi> Doctors, which have

               <p>These things considered, whosoever shall after <note place="margin">Pag. 204.</note> say, that your Church claimes all her Doctrines to have come by a Verball and constant Tradition to her from the Apostles, I will not say that he is

very impudent, but I cannot think that a small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-will put him out of countenance, for your part, I esteeme you so much, that I am confident you have not so little Nose as not to find the contrary, nor so little Forehead as not to confesse it, having received the <hi>Affidavit</hi> of such a cloud of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</p>
               <p>Whosoever pretend Christ his Truth against her, <note place="margin">Object.</note> saith, that true it is, she had once had the true way, but by length of times she is fallen into grosse Errors, which they will reform, not by any Truth which they have received from hand to hand from those, who by both Parts are acknowledged to have received their lesson from Christ, and his Apostles, but by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, either out of Ancient Writers, or the secrets of Reason.</p>

                  </gap> sow Tares among the Tradition of the Apostles and Fathers: if when they make this claime they either say so, and think not so, or think so, and erre, then this proves, that though the <hi>Roman</hi> Church did make that claime which you say she doth, yet she too might either claime it against her Conscience, or against Truth: For this claime of the last cannot be denyed but by him, who will imitate that <hi>Hamshire</hi> Clown, of whom you give me warning, and believe no more then he sees himself, especially since your own Authors, when they dispute for Traditions, prove their authority from this profession of the <hi>Greekes:</hi> but I cannot blame you to forget them, (if we would suffer you) since they cannot be remembred but by your Religions disadvantage; For I verily believe, that if they had but one Addition which they want, (I mean Riches) not onely most of them who leave the Protestants, would sooner go to them then to you, (unlesse they would take their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as we take Boates, for being the Next) but money among you, who (though they dislike your pretended Infallibility, that the Popes usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations upon the rights of other Bishops, his (not ancient) claime of power to deliver Soules out of Purgatory, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> And yet are frighted from joyning with the Protestants, by want of Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,

Vocation, and such like Bull-beggers) would goe over to them (as I have heard <hi>Spalato</hi> meant to doe) if they were not kept, by an unwillingnesse to change the spirituall tyrannie of the Pope, for the temporall of the <hi>Turke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But (although there were no such Churches, or they made no such claime, yet having shew'd out of your own Authors, that some opinions have not been constantly delivered by Tradition, but have entered into the Church upon the grounds (which might at least possiblie deceive them) of Scripture, Reason, and Revelation, and others knockt apace to be let in) I hope we may be excused for making a reveiw of all, and examining what doctrines have been brought in, if not by Scripture (which we think reasonable) at least by comparing what this age teacheth and requires, with what the first Ages did; to which we are encourag'd by your selves, who make agreement with Antiquitie, the chief mark of the Church, unlesse you meane your selves to be onelie Judges, even of those things by which you bid us to judge you: For our examinations by reason, I cannot tell why you mislike it, since those who trust their own reason least, trust it yet to chuse for them one whom they may trust, against which, all Arguments drawn from her fallibilitie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out question lie. Your Religion is built upon your Church, her authoritie upon reasons, which we think slight and fallacious, and your selves think but prudentiall and probable; ought we not then, nay, must we not examine them by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54903:91"/>
or receive them upon your word: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them probable reason, yet I have still cause to examine further, whether your super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions be not more unreasonable then your foundations are reasonable, for then I cannot receive a more unprobable doctrine, then that is probable, which it is prov'd by: Yet (in respect of things appearing divers, at divers times) I doe not like my own way so well, as to esteem it absolutelie infallible, but though I keep it, because I account it the best, yet I will promise to leave it, when you can shew me a better, which will be hard to doe, because you cannot prove it to be better but by reason, against which proofe (and consequentlie against whatsoever it proves) your own Objections remaine; For to be perswaded by reason, that to such an authoritie I ought to submit it, is still to follow reason, and not to quit her. And by what else is it, that you examine what the Apostles taught, when you examine that by ancient Tradition, and ancient Tradition by a present Testimonie? Yet when I speake thus of finding the Truth by Reason, I intend not to exclude the Grace of God, which I doubt not (for as much as is necessarie to Salvation) is readie to concurre to our Instruction; as the Sunne is to our sight, if we by a wilfull winking chuse not to make, not it, but our selves guilty of our blindnesse: Indeed if we love darknesse bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then light, and instead of esteeming it, shut it out, it were but just in God, if we so continue long hardened, not to suffer it to see after when
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54903:91"/>
we would, since so obstinatelie we would not when we might, like to that which happened to those Englishmen, of whom <hi>Froissard</hi> speakes, who having long bound up an eye, and made a foolish vow, never to see with that till they could see their Mistresses, when they returned, and unbound them, they saw nothing, but that they could not see.</p>
               <p>Yet when I speake of Gods grace, I mean not, that it infuseth a knowledge without reason, but workes by it, as by its Minister, and dispels those Mists of Passions, which doe wrap up Truth from our Understandings. For if you speake of its instructing any other way, though I confesse it is possible (as God may give us a sixth sence) yet it is not ordinarie, and ought not to be brought to dispute, because so we leave visible Arguments to flie to invisible, and your Adversarie, when he hath found your play, will be soon at the same locke, and I beleeve in this sence, infus'd Faith is but the same thing, otherwise apparell'd, which you have so often laught at in the <hi>Puritans,</hi> under the title of private Spirit.</p>
               <p>This being supposed, either this Principle hath <note place="margin">Object.</note> remain'd unto her ever since her beginning, or she took it up in some one Age of the sixteen, if she took it up, she then thought, she bad nothing in her, but what she had receiv'd from her fore-fathers, and if she thought so she knew it.</p>
               <p>This Principle is not yet taken up by her, and <note place="margin">Resp.</note> suppose it were, yet since some other opinions are confess'd to have been receiv'd by her, not from
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:54903:92"/>
a constant Tradition, but Scripture, and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and not at once, but by little and little, this very Principle of receiving nothing but from Tradition, might it selfe have been receiv'd not from Tradition: nor need it have been in any one Age of the sixteen, but some might have taught it in one Age, more in another, and all at last, and this so farre from being an impossibilitie, that it were no wonder.</p>
               <p>Let us adde, that the multitude of this Church <note place="margin">Object.</note> is so dispersed through so many Countries, and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, that it is impossible they should agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon a false Determination, to affirme with one consent a Falsity for Truth, no Interest being able to be common to them all, to produce such an effect.</p>
               <p>Although so many Countries could not so <note place="margin">Resp.</note> well agree upon it at once, yet some might so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade others, that in time and by degrees the disease may be grown epidemicall: And trulie, considering in everie Countrie how few there are, who thinke of Religion at all, or of them againe, who walke in it by the directions of their owne eyes, even of them who take upon them to shew that way to others, but for the most part (which they did much more in more ignorant times, when <hi>Scriptura sacra cum vetustis authoribus frigebat</hi>) are lead by some few, whom they reverence for their Piety and learning, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> whose words are accounted lawes, and they againe by a <hi>Thomas,</hi> or a <hi>Scot,</hi> or at best by <hi>Austine,</hi> or <hi>Hierome,</hi> and thinke it Tradition
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:54903:92"/>
enough to have it from them (for else why thinke they to beare us downe with the Authoritie of one or two Fathers, if they thinke that not ground enough to goe upon themselves) it seemes little stranger to me, that whole Countries should let in not ancient opinions, then that a few should, since a few in all places have ever govern'd all the rest; of this I will bring two very known examples out of the Ecclesiasticall Historie.</p>
               <p>The first is of <hi>Valens</hi> the Emperour, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe an <hi>Arrian,</hi> and making peace with a Nation which was not so, and supposing that they would never have firme concord with him, to whom in Faith he was so opposite, was advised to perswade their Bishop to change his beleife, for which end having employ'd both words and money, and effected it, the Bishop, directlie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie <note place="margin">Theodoret lib 4.</note> to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> being himselfe weakened, weakened his brethren, who yeelded to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with the <hi>Arrians</hi> (which before they abhorr'd from) and to esteeme the Father greater then the Sonne.</p>
               <p>The second, is of that <hi>Macedonian</hi> Bishop, who, being persecuted by the Catholique Bishop of the same place (who was then gone to <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> to fetch Souldiers, by whose assistance he might afflict the Hereticks the more) resolved to turne Catholicke, and perswaded all his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers to joyne with him in that Act, and this in so short a time, that when the other returned, he found him chosen Bishop unanimouslie by both Parties, and himselfe (for his crulelty,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54903:93"/>
not undeservedlie) excluded.</p>
               <p>There is besides another thing which helpes to lett in great errors, which is, that men naturally neglect small things, and small things in time na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally beget great; for which cause <hi>Aristotle</hi> shewing to us severall causes of the Changes of Government, one of them is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> often a great chang comes stealingly in, whenwhat is little is not considered.</p>
               <p>Yet besides the generall carelessnesse; The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Teachers, the Flexibility of the Taught, and the smallnesse of the Things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at the beginning, even Interest it selfe (which consists of two Parts, Feares, and Hopes) is able to produce great effects: Of this me thinkes your selves may be witnesses, who use to call ours, a <hi>Parliamentary Religion,</hi> as thinking, that the Will of the Prince, and both Houses, onely made it to be received: Whereas in the beginning of Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Raigne, of many thousaud Livings which were in <hi>England,</hi> the Incumbents of not a hundred, chose rather to lose their Benefices for your opinions, then to keepe them by subscribing to ours; all who (for the greatest Part) of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity must be supposed for private interest, to have dissembled their Religion, either then or immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the Third Booke of <hi>Evagrius</hi> we find, that above five hundred Bishops subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed against the Councell of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> which we have reason to think most did unwillingly, (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54903:93"/>
if the Infallibility of a generall Councell were so famous a Doctrine for Catholiques as now it is) because we know it was upon <hi>Basiliscus</hi> his commands, and that a considerable Part of them (the Bishops of <hi>Asia</hi>) profess'd after they were forct to it, though before they had been very angry in another Epistle with those, who said that they had done by force, rather then Free-will.</p>
               <p>And over, and above all this we may see by <hi>Erasmus</hi> his words, that many might not oppose a Doctrine brought in by great Power, in hope of a time to do it in, when there might be more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood of prevailing: For he saith in one place of his Epistles, that those who resist opinions, when there is no probable meanes of doing good by it, are like those, who out of season attempt to break Prison, who gaines nothing by it, but to have their Irons doubled upon them: And the same cause which he thinks should move them to stay (outwardly) contentedly in Prison, may have made many others not resist, when they were first by violence and crowd carried thither, who might feare least their opposall might not help their cause, but beget a definition against it. And there being thus many severall motives which may work upon so many severall kindes of men, it is no wonder, if an error may soon over-runne all men, or seem to do so.</p>
               <p>Next, Whereas you speak of severall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and Languages, I must desire you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the Clergy of your Church are as it were all of one Language, (<hi>Latine</hi> either being, or
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:54903:94"/>
being supposed to be, as much theirs, as that of their own People) and being under the Dominion of one, that is the Pope, which makes them as it were one Country, and from them the Laity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all their opinions: Nay in ancient times almost all considerable men spoke the Language of the governing Nation, (as all of the better sort of the <hi>Irish</hi> do <hi>English</hi>) and the greatest part of Christians were governed by one man, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and so a new opinion may easily have been received generally, no such barres being set up to hinder it, as you alleadge.</p>
               <p>Christian Doctrine is not a speculative knowledge <note place="margin">Object.</note> instituted for delight, but it is an Art of living, a Rule of attaining to eternall blisse; hence it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that no error can fall, even in a point which sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth wholly speculative in Christian Faith, but soon it breedeth a Practicall effect; or rather defection in Christian behaviour.</p>
               <p>I wonder much to heare you say this, who cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely <note place="margin">Resp.</note> have a Religion consisting of many points, which are no wayes reduced into Practice: Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from the degrees in which they are held, (which I conceive introduced) could arise no change in Christian behaviour; I confesse that Christian Religion being a Covenant between God, and Man by the entermise of Christ, we Christians are properly concerned, but in the knowledge of what are the Conditions and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward proposed and promised, what wee are to observe, and what to hope for; and in so farre forth understanding the Nature and Attributes
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:54903:94"/>
of the Covenant-maker and bringer, as we may be made sure, that whatsoever God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised or threatened, that indeed he hath: But though this principally concernes us, yet the necessity of beleeving the veracity of God, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth us moreover to give our Assents to any thing, how little soever it have to doe with pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise (as Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> having Parchments) if it be once made to appeare to us either by Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reason, Tradition, or any way to have been said by God either immediately, or mediately by Christ and his Apostles: And do not your selves count the <hi>Greekes</hi> Heretickes for denying the Procession of the Holy Ghost from the Son, (though many Fathers deny it too) though, I pray, what hath that to do with Practice or Christian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, and if you should now change your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in this point, what outward change would it breed, except onely the blotting out of one clause in a Creed in your Liturgy, wherein it was not at first? And not so much outward change would there be, if you should turne to believe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap. 6 Lib. 3</hi> de Romano Pontifice.</note> 
                  <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> not bo be still alive, the contrary to which <hi>Belarmini</hi> saies all Catholiques hold now with a certaine Faith: And many more are of this kind.</p>
               <p>Whether man have Free-will or no, seemeth a <note place="margin">Object.</note> Question belonging to some curious philosopher; but upon the Preaching of the Negative part, presently followed an unknown Libertinage, men yeelding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves over to all kind of Concupiscence, since they were perswaded they had no power to resist, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54903:95"/>
being taken away.</p>
               <p>At this time it is not my own cause which I plead, <note place="margin">Resp.</note> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> since in this point I confesse, I should rather be a <hi>Pelagian,</hi> then a <hi>Calvinist,</hi> since the first doth not wholly overthrow Gods grace, (for whatever we have by Nature, His grace gives us) but the second wholly overthrowes His justice, besides the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect contrariety of their Doctrine to Scripture, they saying in effect, that the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is to take us by violence, whereas that teaches us, that we are to take it so: But yet give me leave to say thus much for them, that though it be true, that ill life followes very consequently from that Principle, and those who hold it, must be ill <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians,</hi> if they be good men, yet it is plaine, that very many of them live as good lives, as any who believe the contrary.</p>
               <p>Besides, this in my opinion concernes as neerely your <hi>Dominicans,</hi> as our <hi>Calvinists,</hi> since they use Free-will, as <hi>Tully</hi> saith <hi>Epicurus</hi> did the Gods, <hi>verbis asserunt, re negant,</hi> assert it in words, but deny it in deed; yet I think you will not say that they are the more licentious, for (by direct conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence) denying Liberty; If therefore an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which is so neerely tyed to action, produce no more effects, how much fewer would those other so much more unconcerning.

               <p>Without change (which though it must be then <note place="margin">Resp.</note> apparent, yet need it not be so to us) I confesse they could not come in, but with little opposition they might: The doubtfull estate of the dead af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life, before the day of <hi>Judgment-audit,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much better that they should have our Prayers, though they want them not, then misse of them if they want them, may not unlikely (and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture not unreasonably) have brought in that Custome without either giving scandale, or being received by Tradition; Though if it had, you would have gotten little by it, for unlesse such a Purgatory, out of which Indulgences may deliver, will follow out of it, the Pope will not care for the other, as being <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Praying to Saints may have come in upon consequences drawne out of mistaken places of Scriptures, or others, which inducing the opinion,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54903:96"/>
that they enjoy'd the beatificall vision before the day of judgement, some might conclude, that then they saw all in it, and at first pray to them but conditionallie, till their number increased, and with it the degree in which they held the opinion, till now to deny it is accounted Heresie, though I know no Father which justifies our invocating of them (although they speake of their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding for us) before <hi>Nazianzene,</hi> whose ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample alone being of so great authoritie might spread it much: though, I pray, remember, who (as saies <hi>Nicephorus Calistus</hi>) it was that brought it first into the publick Liturgie.</p>
               <p>It is not possible, that any materiall point of <note place="margin">Object.</note> Christian Faith can be changed, as it were, by obreption, whilst men are on sleep, but it must needs raise a great scandall, and tumult: For suppose the Apostles had taught the world it were Idolatry to pray to Saints, or use reverence to their Pictures, how can we imagine this honour brought in but by a vehement conflict, and tumult in a people, which did so greatly abhorre Idolatry, as the Apostles and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples did.</p>

                  </gap> I spoke cheiflie, <note place="margin">Resp.</note> not of changing a point of Faith, but of creating one, not of contradicting a doctrine delivered from the Apostles, but of introducing one, of which they were wholly silent, either as theirs at first (as yee must say <hi>Pappias</hi> did) or onely as True, till being rooted and spread, it be beleeved Apostolicall upon <hi>Tertullian's</hi> Argument, that else how could so many Churches, <hi>errare in unam</hi>

                  </gap> I say, tis most easie to answer that which is not imputed, for I am so farre from saying that the Apostles taught these two things to be Idolatrie (since on my Conscience they spake not of them directlie at all) that I my selfe will not say they are. For Prayer to Saints (set aside your Idolatrie-like Expressions, seeming to beg that of them, which you professe, you meane onely to have them beg for you) I suppose the Question to be but this, whether they heare us or no (which Martyrs might possiblie doe, and yet no other, how holy and canoniz'd soever, because many Fathers held that none else see God yet) If they doe, I beleeve you may as well (or better, because you are more sure of their being in favour with God) desire them to intercede for you, as you may desire the Prayers of any living Friend, but if they doe not, then I will not say in <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> phrase, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> what Thunder-bolts doth it not deserve, but how unreasonable is it to cast men out of the Church, and send them out of the world, for not assenting to an opinion, which you cannot prove.</p>
               <p>For reverence to the Pictures of Saints, if you
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:54903:97"/>
meane onely some outward civill respect, to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie the great honour and love which you beare the Prototypes, It is, I beleeve, no more Idolatrie, then keeping off our hats in the Presence-Chamber to the Cloth of Estate.</p>
               <p>Yet this I am so farre from esteeming necessarie, that I thinke they had better never come in, then have occasion'd so much un-christian turmoile about so indifferent a thing. The first and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest Ages did well enough without these Pictures (we heare onely of a Parabolicall one of Christ <note place="margin">Tertul.</note> in a Chalice) after they came to be made, after to be set in Churches, afterto be prayed before, nay, at last they are come to so great an excesse, that not onely against Scripture, but all Antiquitie, they are now come to picture God the Father himselfe: Upon a Popes Letter to an Emperour, wherein he defends the picturing of Saints and Christ, and speakes improbablie of the Antiquitie of their Pictures, and addes the reason why they pictured not God the Father, <hi>Baronius</hi> saies in the Margent. Yet it hath after happened, that they pictured him as he hath appeared; a way which the Church of that time could easily have found out, had they thought it lawfull, as it is plaine Saint <hi>Austine</hi> did not, unlesse <hi>Nefas est</hi> be <note place="margin">De fide &amp; Symb.</note> an Approbation: This alone may serve to shew that beleifes may come in, even contrarie to that of former time (and yet we not know when they entered) unlesse you will oppose a superficiall reason, that a thing cannot be to a plaine example that it is, and force me to answer with <hi>Barlaam,</hi>

               <p>This is but a continuance of the same Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logisme: <note place="margin">Resp.</note> For at this time, in these places, a set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Religion being contradicted, the case is very different from an Opinions prevailing in the mindes of men, when they were yet white Paper, and not filled with any doctrine to the contrarie, either because though once the contrarie had been taught, yet it had slept a good while, or because nothing had before been spoken concerning it: We know, that nothing makes Noise but Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition and Resistance, and if that be not much, it will not last long, and the memorie of it as little: Besides most of these points making for the power and wealth of the Clergie, you must not expect, that there should have been as great an out-crie and hubbub when they were introduced at first, as when expelled after long prevailing, it being a worke, both more short, easie, and secret to plant an Acorne, then to cut down or remove an Oake (<gap reason="foreign">

               <p>There is no point of doctrine contrary to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke <note place="margin">Object.</note> Church rooted in any Christian Nation, that the Ecclesiasticall History doth not mention, the times
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:54903:98"/>
and combats, by which it entered, and tore the Church in peices.</p>
               <p>The combats wherein it tore the Church, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure <note place="margin">Resp.</note> it doth, but of the times wherein many entered, they are altogether silent. All take notice of <hi>Arrius</hi> his words, when by reason of <hi>Alexander's</hi> hot opposition there grew divisions, but of what the Orthodox-counted Authors (which we have) before the Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> said (though aske <hi>Perron,</hi> and he will tell you, how like <hi>Arrianisme</hi> they look) no Ecclesiasticall Historie makes any mention, because they made no bounce like the other, and so in likeliehood tooke no more notice of other opinions, which made none neither. And what is said of this point, may be said of <hi>Eutychianisme</hi> (see the same place of <hi>Perron</hi>) for we know how <hi>Dioscorus</hi> called upon the Fathers of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and others, whose opinions were certainlie in the Church before them, who are now counted the Authors of them.</p>
               <p>Nay, even of opinions rooted (as you call it) are not the Procession of the Holy Ghost from the the Father onely, the communicating Infants, the admitting none to the Beatificall Vision but Martyrs, and other such rooted in the <hi>Greeke</hi> Church? or can yon tell when they entered? at least was it not long before any combat concerning them? But suppose this weretrue, it is but accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so, for some of those writings which deliver this to us, might as well have been lost, as many others which were, so that no man can conclud that, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54903:98"/>
no beginning can be shewed in Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call story, that hath not been introduced, (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally since I speak not so much of opinions oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Ancient Tradition, as of Superfaetations, not onely of pointes indeed Materiall, but of such as in continuance of time, have grown to be thought so) for how can I tell, many of them having been lost, but some of those would have given me notice of it, if I now had them.</p>
               <p>Let it therefore remaine for evidently constant, that <note place="margin">Object.</note> into the Christian Church can come no Errors, but it must be seen and noted, and raise scandale and opposition.</p>

For the knowledge, which we have of these things, is but <hi>Reliquiae Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum,</hi> what was overseen by the zeale and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and how much we want of what we might have known, had the rest scap'd, no man can tell who pretends not to Revelation, and to the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of knowing what was in Books, whereof he never saw any, and never heard of most: But though it followes not, such a thing hath been done, therefore it must ever be, yet it followes (in spite of

               <p>As in our Naturall Body, the Principall parts are <note place="margin">Object.</note> defended by bones, flesh, skins, and other defences, that no outward Agent can come to offend there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having annoyed some of these; so in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Faith, there are in speculations, those which we call Theologicall Conclusions, and other pious opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and in practice, many rights and ceremonies, which stoppe the Passage unto the maine Principall

               <p>Either these Theologicall conclusions, and pious <note place="margin">Resp.</note> opinions are derived from the same Tradition, or they are not; if they be, then sure they are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matters of Faith, and so need some other course to defend them, and you must find <hi>Quis custodiet ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sos custodes:</hi> If they be not, but were onely De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions either of the first Ages Logick, (which was not alwaies excellent) or of that of more Modern times, then may they so easily be false themselves, that I know not how they can serve to preserve the rest certainly from all corruption in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to secure any Truth: But I believe many may be miscounted Hereticks, for onely opposing some of these, what through the over-caution, and too much ardor of some <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> and of the greater part lead by a few such, what through their being come (having been long) from pious opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to be matters of Faith, as in great Families Servants, who haue waited long in meaner places, are rewarded with higher: Besides I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that many Doctrines, which you account ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, have no such redoubts about them, or at least have not alwaies had, and indeed you onely affirming it by <hi>Tullies</hi> Rule, (who was no small Master of Reason) <hi>Sat erit verbo negare,</hi> It will be enough for me barelie to deny it.

               <p>But still, I speaking most of the easinesse, that false and new Doctrines not contradicting the old, may be brought into the Church, what answer is it to tell me, how the Principall of Christian Religion are sure guarded, since so they may be, and yet such other may be brought in: As Christs Promises, and chiefe injunctions may be retained, and yet praying to Saints, and Purgatory, and such like, be superinduct.</p>

               <p>If you mean the second, (for so you must by your Inference, though the words of the Question will bear both sences) it is as impossible for you to receive an answer.

And of this, <hi>France</hi> may as well be an example as <hi>England,</hi> wherein many called <hi>Cassandrians,</hi> dissent from the publiquely received Doctrines, though with so little stirr, that our Posterity will not know that there now are such; So that all which any man can answer to this Question, is, that such a one was the first that he knowes of, who taught such a Doctrine, and such a time the first, wherein he knowes not that any contradicted it, or that your Church defines it for a necessary opinion, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted assent to it, as a condition of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; which answer will be nearer to Truth or Falshood, according to the measure of the answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers learning; And indeed if you please to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that when learning rose againe, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation began, most <hi>Manuferipts</hi> of considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Books, had long layn unreguarded by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerallity in Popish Libraries, and out of them onely had some few been Printed, you must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that it was in the power of your Church, what answer we should be able to make to that Question which you propose, which then it is no wonder if it were not answered, for your willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to keep men in darknesse concerning this,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54903:103"/>
even in times of most light, is to be seen by your expurgatory Indexes: For there, though you professe to meddle with none but Moderne Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, (whereas it is plaine you go as high as <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram</hi>) yet both that will serve to deceive our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity concerning the generall opinions of these times, and if your Church in former Ages used any course somewhat Analogicall to this, upon those Authors who then were moderne too, (as likely enough they did, or you have cause to hope they did for your more justification) then how can I know when any opinion entered, that is, either first was at all, or first by all taught: since in all times (how little mention soever be made of it) there may have been some Doctors of that opinion, though either no Authors, or allthough Authors, yet by this Stratageme may be kept from us.</p>
               <p>Neither indeed can you answer this Question your self, for you know not in what Year, or Age, did either the giving the <hi>Eucharist</hi> to Infants begin, or end, at least Saint <hi>Austine</hi> knew not the first, who believed it an Apostolical Tradition: Neither was this a bare Custome, but implyed an opinion of good which Children received, which the change shewes plainely to have altered, and certainely either the first opinion was a Superstition, or the latter a Sacriledge.</p>
               <p>But howsoever your Consequence followes not, for though your Church conspired, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their Posterity, yet it might not conspire to deceive their Posterity, but to instruct it, being themselves deceived. And therefore when you
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54903:103"/>
reckon up the Motives which men have to speak false, I wonder to see Hopes, and Feares put in, and error left out.</p>
               <p>It is Gods course deeplier to root and strengthen <note place="margin">Object.</note> those things which he would have most flourish. Now Christians know, that he made mankind for his Elect, the world for mankind, and therefore he hath rooted those things, which more immediately belong to his Elect (as his Church, Faith, and Holy Spirit in it) then the principles either of mans nature or of the world, which was made for it, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe assuring us of it, when he told us, <hi>That one tittle should not perish of the holy Writ, though Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth should be dissolved,</hi> and so seeing the latter principle relyeth upon the not failing of God to his Church, which should ever watch upon their actions, that nothing should creepe into Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian life, which presently the Zeale of the faithfull should not startle at. I thinke it needlesse, to seeke further to qualifie the strength of that part, which receiveth it from the quality of so good a workman as the Holy Ghost.</p>

Neither indeed know I, how God hath made mankinde for his Elect: It is true, that having elected those who shall persevere in Faith and Obedience, and given man Free-will, which (joyned with Grace universallie offered) might bring him to the condition, and in that to election, and by that to Heaven; God may be said, to have made mankinde for his elect, that is, to be his elect, if they shut not themselves out of the way to be so; And all men (especiallie Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) I beleeve have, and alwaies shall have meanes enough to performe these conditions, in such a measure (all things considered, I meane, either naturall defects, as in Ideots, never having heard of Christ, as in many Pagans, not having Christs will sufficientlie proposed, as in many Christians, and whosoever is not by some fault in his will hindered from assenting, to him it is not propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed sufficientlie) as shall by God be from them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:54903:104"/>
               <p>But this hinders not, but that all Christians may see what they should, if they stand not in their own light, or wilfullie winke, and if they neglect Christs Instructions or Commands, and make themselves deafe against his voice, charme he never so wiselie, they then may fall from ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie Truths (much more from others) unto error, as well as from good life into wickednesse, from which, without question, Gods Spirit is as readie to keep men that will be kept, as from the other, and which is no lesse (if not more) part of the conditions required (for in that epitomie, which Christ hath given us of the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, men are onely mentioned to be punished for want of Charitie, and not mis-interpretations of doctrine) though I grieve to see so many of all parts (whereof I am too much one) live, as if God were so obliged to them for their Faith, that he were bound to winke upon their workes, and not to be an Idolater, or not a Heretick, were enough not to be damned.</p>
               <p>And certainlie to say, <hi>That one tittle of Gods Word shall not passe away,</hi> is not to say, that God will keepe here alwaies a knowne companie of men to teach us all Divine Truths, which from them, because of their authoritie, we may without more adoe accept (for unlesse you meane the Church in this sence, it concernes not our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences) till you can prove that this word makes some such promise. For this seemes to me onelie to shew the veracitie of Gods Word, without speaking at all of any Churches continuall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience

to it, or true interpretation of it, or the impossibilitie of her receiving the Traditions of men for the will of God.</p>
               <p>Besides in this Paragraph I observe three things:</p>
               <p>The first, That you now draw your Arguments from the stedfast Truth of Holie Writ, whereas you neither quote out of it any thing to prove your maine Assertion, and in that way, which you laid before to finde out Truth by, you tooke no notice at all of Scripture, but would have all differences decided, by onely comparing what men had by verball Tradition, like that <hi>Dominican,</hi> of whom <hi>Erasmus</hi> tels us in his Epistles, that when in the Schooles any man refuted his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, by shewing it contrarie to the words of Scripture, he would crie out, <hi>Ista est Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio Lutherana, protestor me non responsurum;</hi> This is a Lutheran way of Arguing, I protest I will not answer to it.</p>
               <p>Secondlie, You now bring the proofe of your certaintie from Gods Spirit never failing his Church (though you neither define what is there meant by Church, nor doe you bring any proofe, or ever can, that Gods Spirit will stay with any unlesse they please it, or that this will not consist with the least error in divine matters) whereas before you made it a Physicall, or rather super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physicall certaintie, that Traditions must be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from Age to Age uncorrupted, and this, not because of any other assistance, but <hi>ex necessitate Rei.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:54903:105"/>
Thirdlie, You seeme to thinke, that aptnesse to startle in the faithfull, will serve to secure them from all error, whereas I must professe my selfe, of opinion, that in some times, and some cases, that may serve to induce it; for (it being trulie said, that there is as much follie beyond wisedome, as on this side of it, and <hi>Nazianzene</hi> telling us trulie, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the marke is equallie mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by over shooting, as by shooting short) I doubt whether over much caution may not have made some doctrines, and their Abetters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned (especiallie when they appeared some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what new) some Truths rejcted for feare, least they did by consequence contradict some point of Faith, when indeed they did, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as Dogs often <note place="margin">Arist. Ethick.</note> barke at a friend for an enemie, upon the first noise he makes, before having considered which he is: This made the Ancients so earnest against the now-certaintie of the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> this in after times, for the same opinion, cost a Bishop his Bishopricke, and truth in all probabilitie, would have then beene defined a heresie, if a generall Councell had been called about it: Since then this aptnesse to startle hath inclined Orthodox Christians to condemn, not onely those who had affirmed in termes the contrarie to Tradition, but even those, from whose opinions they thought it would result, and consequentlie to exact an Assent, not onely to direct Tradition, but also to whatsoever else seemed to them reasonable
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:54903:106"/>
deductions from it; This seemes to me a way by which Errors may have entered by shoales, the first Ages (I mean then, <hi>Cum</hi> Augustinus <hi>habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur inexpugnabilis Dialecticus, quod legisset Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorias</hi> Aristotelis) not having been so carefull and subtile in their Logick, as these more learned times both <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Calvinists, Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Jesuites, Papists</hi> and <hi>Protestants,</hi> seeming to me to argue much more consequently to their owne Principles, more close to their present businesse, and every way more rationally then the ancient Doctors used to do I mean those which I have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen: And I am confident that if two or three Fathers should rise againe unknown, and should return to their old Argument against the <hi>Arrians,</hi> from <hi>Cor meum eructavit verbum bonum,</hi> both Parties would be so farr from receiving them for Judges, that neither would accept of them for Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates, nor trust their Cause to their arguing, who opposed their common enemy no better.</p>
               <p>Now that this way of making Deductions out of Tradition, and those both very hasty, and false ones is very ancient, appeares even by an example in the end of the Gospell of <hi>John,</hi> for there out of Christs words falsly interpreted, a conclusion was drawn and spread among the Bretheren, that Saint <hi>John</hi> should not dye, and what they did out of these words of Christ, other in other times may have done out of other words of his, and their Collection passe for his Doctrine; which shewes the great advantage which we have by Gods Word being written since, if it had not, we could
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:54903:106"/>
not alwaies have gone to a new examination of the very words, which Christ or his Apostles taught, and consequently a consequence of them spread in the place of them, would have been more incurable then now it is. I will also desire you to look in the five hundered eighty fourth Page of the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine Councell,</hi> set out by <hi>Binius,</hi> and there you will find, that the <hi>Latines</hi> confesse, that they added the Procession of the Holy Ghost from the Son, to the Creed, because the contrary opinion seemed to them by consequence, contrary to a confessed Tradition of Christs eternall Divinity, to which, yet it will appear out of what Cardinall <hi>Perron</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Con. Reg. Iac. Pag. 708.</note> hath excellently showne, (though upon another oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion) that it doth not contradict, but that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence was ill drawne, which may have been in other points too, and have brought in no small multitude of Errors since, neither was their <hi>Logick</hi> certaine to conclude better, nor were they lesse apt to add to their Creeds accordingly, at any other times then they were at that.</p>
               <p>I doubt not but whosoever shall have received satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction <note place="margin">Object.</note> in the discourse past, will also have received in the point we seek after, that is, in being assured both that Christ hath left a Directory in the World, and where to find him, there being no doubt but it is his holy Church upon Earth: Nor can there be any doubt which is his Church, since there is but one that doth, and can lay claime to have received from hand to hand his holy Doctrine.</p>
               <p>That which makes you expect that your Reader <note place="margin">Resp.</note> should have received satisfaction by what you have
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:54903:107"/>
said, is, that since Christ hath a great care of his Elect, he must consequently (most strongly of any thing) have rooted his Church. Now I having shewed, that by your own confession, men may be of his Elect, that are out of your Church, I seemed to my selfe to have likewise proved, that there is no necessity of any Churches being their Director. I know you generally think this the more convenient way, to have left such a guide, that because otherwise <hi>Dominus non fuisset Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> or in <hi>Epicttus</hi> his Phrase, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <note place="margin">Arrian.</note> you conclude that he hath: but we (though indeed in such cases where our <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the common Notions concerning God, teach us that such a Thing were contrary to Gods maine Attributes to do, some of us conclude upon that ground, that this he hath not done) in these cases which onely concerne convenience, of which we have much lesse certaintie, begin at the other end, and considering first what he hath done, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that to be sufficiently convenient, and so finding no infallible guide by him instituted, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it convenient that there should be none: Truely if convenience were the measure, and our Understandings the measurers, we should resolve that God hath made every Particular man, at least every Pious man Infallible, and so to need no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward guide, which yet it is plain that he hath not done. Though in my opinion, in some sence, he hath made every man (who pleaseth) Infallible, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his journys end, though not of all Innes by the way, certaine to find Heaven though he may
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:54903:107"/>
misse many Truthes in Divine matters: For the beliefe which God requires of being to be thought true of his word, and that man be ready to believe and obey what he saies, as soon as it shall appear to him that he hath said it, and every man being able (according to his meanes) to examine what he hath said; It followes, unlesse God should damne a man for weaknesse of understanding, (which were as strange, as if he should damne him for a weak sight, or afeeble arme) that every man is Infallible in his way to Heaven, so he lay no blocks in it himself, (at least is undoubtedly secur'd of any danger of Hell) For if they neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to avoide the trouble of enquiry through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingness to find that to be true, which is contrary to what he now thinks, and so to hazard either the affection of deare Friends, or the favour of great Friends, or the feare of some other humane Inconvenience, as want of present meanes, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability to get more, or of that disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment so terrible to flesh and blood, of descending to confesse that they have so long erred, (like <hi>Frobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, qui potuisset vivere, nisi puduisset aegrotare,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eras. Ep.</note> who might have lived, but that he was ashamed to confesse himself sick) If I say none of these or the like things, either keep him from seeking what is Gods will, or from daring to professe it when he hath found it, then such an Error having no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the will, which is the onely fountaine of sin, cannot by a just God be punished as a sin, and the proofe of the necessity of an Infallible Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector drawn from Gods care of his Church, for
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:54903:108"/>
his Elects sake, is easily avoided.</p>
               <p>But say you, if there be a director, it must be the Church, and againe, because you know that all congregations of Christians, pretend to that Title in some sence, (as even the worst men call themselves by better Names then they deserve, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <p>Let us consider in her Presence or Visibility, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, <note place="margin">Object.</note> Power; As for the first, her multitude and succession make the one, that she is ever accessible, ever knowne.</p>
               <p>What you now say, is not to prove your <note place="margin">Resp.</note> Church a Directresse, but having (as you think, and I think not) proved that already, you now mean to shew, that she hath the Conditions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite in a Directresse: But this I deny, for neither is her presence or Visibility, (for all her
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:54903:108"/>
multitude and succession) such as were in a Direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resse required: For she (besides that she must bring notice and proofes with her, to prove that she is instituted by God to direct men, and those plain and evident, if she require meerly but our assent, but if she require us to assent Infallibly, then those Infallible, which yours cannot do) must also be so visible, as to be known to all men, if not as a Directresse, at least as a Company of men, which yours sure was not to those Nations, which were lately discovered by <hi>Columbus:</hi> But if you except and say, she need onely be visible to all Christians, (though this exception need a proofe) yet even this Condition your Church hath not allwaies had, for I believe, to those Christians whom <hi>Xaverius</hi> found in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> your Church had been as little visible, as to those <hi>Pagans</hi> whom <hi>Columbus</hi> discovered in the <hi>West:</hi> Besides beyond the <hi>Abissins,</hi> how farre Christian Religion may be propagated, and yet your Church unknown, who can tell? Besides, even to most of them (for any credible Testimony that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares) she may not be very visible. But above all, that reason being answered, upon which you conclude, that there is some Director, and that ground being taken away upon which you build, that yours is that, me thinks it will be unnecessary to dispute long upon the Conditions required to that, which hath no entity at all.</p>
               <p>For Authority, her very claime of Antiquity and <note place="margin">Object.</note> Succession, to have been that Church which received her beginning from Christ and his Apostles, and never
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:54903:109"/>
being all united under the universall government of ver fore-went it, giveth à great reverence to her among those who believe her, and amongst those who with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency seek to inform themselves, a great Prejudice above others. And if it be true, it carrieth an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Authority with it, of Bishops, Doctors, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, Saints, Miracles, Learning, Wisedome, Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Antiquity, and such like. <note place="margin">Resp.</note>
               </p>
               <p>There is no Question, but any Church, true or false, which claimes to have ever kept the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Doctrines uncorrupted, and is infallibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to have done so, must among those Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans who thus beleeve, have even equall Authority with the Apostles. But me thinks that this claime before proofe, should to others be any prejudice for her, (especially to those who have great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against her) is unreasonable, and if after consideration it appears otherwise, she hath then onely helpt to weaken her Testimony, and hath destroyed her Infallible Authority in any thing else.</p>
               <p>There remaineth Power, which no man can doubt <note place="margin">Object.</note> but he hath given it most ample, who considereth his words so often repeated to his Apostles: But ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting from that, who doth not see that the Church hath the nature and proportion of ones Country to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryone. As in a mans Country he hath Father and Mother, Brothers, Sisters, Kinsfolkes, and Allies, Neighbours and Country-men, (anciently called <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves</hi> and <hi>Concives</hi>) and of these are made his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; So in the Church finds he in way to spirituall Instruction, and Education, all these digrees nearer and further off, till he come unto that furthermost of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:54903:109"/>
Christ his Vicar: and as he in his Country finds Bearing, Breeding, Settling in Estates and Fortunes, and lastly, Protection and Security; So likewise in the way of Christianity, doth he find this much more fully in the Church, So that if it be true, that a man oweth more to his Master then to his Father, <hi>Bene esse</hi> is better then <hi>esse;</hi> certainly a man also (as farr as Church and Country can be separated) must owe more to the Church, then to his very Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; Wherefore the Power which the Church hath to Command and instruct, is greater then the Power of the Temporall Community, of which he is part.</p>
               <p>I wish you would have set down these words of Christ, so often repeated to his Apostles, in which <note place="margin">Resp.</note> Power to the Church (I mean such a one as yours pretends) is undoubtedly given; For my Part, Truely I remember none; For I suppose not that the Power given to the Apostles can reasonably be claimed by any Society of men now, no not though you should extend the Definition as largely as <hi>Erasmus,</hi> (who saies <hi>Ecclesiam voco totius Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li Christiani concensum,</hi> I call the Church, the Consent of the whole Christian People) unlesse that be meant too in all Ages, and so the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siles would come in; They were so signed, and sealed to (as I may say) from Heaven, by having most conversed with Christ, and been most be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by him, and chosen especially to teach the World his Will, that it is impossible any men could be indeed Christians, and not receive their Doctrine, as that of Christ, without any other Proofe, but there is no other Church that hath
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54903:110"/>
such a Priviledge, The Power of proposing she hath, and so have you, and without Question, if you can convince any Christian that what you said, Christ said first, he is bound both to believe and obey it, and againe let all Churches joyne in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posall, yet till he be so convinced, (unlesse his own fault hinder it) it binds him not, neither is it sufficiently proposed, allowing it true, which it is not alwaies necessary that it should be, although so attested. For as a Naturall Foole is not bound to obey any Doctrine or Precept, taught or imposed by God himself, because his understanding can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not discover it to be so: so in my opinion, whose understanding soever is not convinc'd of the same, (how plain soever to others the thing be) he is for as much as concernes this point, in the state of a Naturall Foole, and no more to be condemned.</p>
               <p>Neither see I what you prove out of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between the Church, and every mans Country, (for if any Church be intended by God to be so our Director, that her propositions are to be received, because they are hers, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we owe her much more obedience then to our Country, which if it should require of us to believe an opinion true, because that hath defined it, I believe no man would obey, and he who should press us to it, would be accounted so mad, that we should send him, not to a Doctor of Divinity, but to a Doctor of Physick, to be confuted.</p>
               <p>And that any Church is so intended, appeares not at all by this proposition, since the same is even amongst the Church of the <hi>Turkes,</hi> which is <hi>Ecclesia</hi>

                  </gap> to destroy these, then they make to defend themselves. And whereas you say, that we owe more gratitude and obedience to the Church, then to our Country, I have told you, that this may be true without owing obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to all she teaches; But yet even this in some sence is True; To the generall Tradition of Christians of the first Ages who lived with the Apostles, and could not in any likelyhood but know their writings; I owe the knowledge of the Scripture, and to that, the knowledge of Gods will, and to that, Heaven, if I conforme carefully to it both my Life and my Beliefe; and to the Church in this sence, I owe both as much grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude as you please, and believe whatsoever this, as generally, witnesseth to have received from the Apostles: But this concerning any present Church, doth as little concerne your present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: For let us mean by the Church, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:54903:111"/>
of men which hath kept Tradition wholly uncorrupted, (and suppose there is such a one) yet to know that she hath done so, I must examine her Doctrine; and compare it either with Scripture, or the first Antiquity, and so rather receive her for it, then it for her: Besides, that the whole Church teaches nothing, and if she did, yet by the same waies from any single learned Orthodox man, I may receive the same instruction, to whose commands neverthelesse (except when he delivers Gods) I owe no obedience.</p>
               <p>Thustoo, when the Orthodox company com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands as they are Orthodox, that is something of the will of God, then they are to be obeyed, and so am I, and so againe, when the chosen go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours for that purpose, command indifferent Things, but if they exceed their Commission in commanding, no man is longer bound to obey, no more then if a <hi>Mayor</hi> of a Town should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the People to make his Hay, they were bound to obedience, since commanding more then his Magistracy authorizeth him, he in that case is no Magisttate.</p>
               <p>This Church can satisfie both learned and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned. <note place="margin">Object.</note> For in matters of Faith, above the reach of learning, whose spring is from what Christ and his Apostles taught, what learned man can refuse in his inmost soule, to bow to that which is testified by so great a multitude to have come from Christ? and what unlearned man can require more for his faith, then to be taught by a Mistresse of so many prerogaives and advantages above all others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:54903:111"/>
The learned cannot reasonablie be satisfied with <note place="margin">Resp.</note> this (especiallie so farre forth as to beleeve it infalliblie true.) First, because they see great multitudes have and doe testifie contrarie things. Secondlie, because they must have observed with <note place="margin">Tom. 13. Pag. 468.</note> 
                  <hi>Salmeron,</hi> that a multitude of some opinion may proceed from some one Doctor, especiallie, if he be Illustrious; and some againe, taken with a pious and an humble feare, chuse rather against their mind, to approve what hath come from others, then to bring forth any new thing out of their own understanding, least they may seem to bring some thing unwonted into the Church. This they must needs see, may bring an undelivered opinion to be generall, and then the generallitie may bring it to be thought to come from Tradition, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Tertullians</hi> rule, <hi>Quod apud multas eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias unum invenitur, non est erratum sed Traditum,</hi> and that of Saint <hi>Austine,</hi> that of whatsoever no beginning is known, and yet is generall, is to be beleeved to have its originall from the Apostles. By this way (supposing that all your Church did witnesse, all their doctrines to have had such a lineall succession, which they know to be false) they see, that opinions falslie and illogicallie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct from true Traditions, may be equallie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved to be such themselves, <hi>Vincentius Liri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nensis</hi> allowing the following Church to give light to the former, which they might mistake in doing, at least, the certaintie of her Illustrations cannot have their force from Tradition: By this way they see, that in time, such doctrines may
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:54903:112"/>
come to have such a generall attestation, which had their first spring from Scripture mis-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, either by publicke mistakes, or by Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels mislead, either by feare, error, or partialitie, and what proceeded either from consent, or definition, may seem to have been deduct from Tradition: In this they will be confirmed, by seeing plainlie, that more is now required to be beleeved by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> then in all times hath been, that now among you contrarie parties urge for or, expect a generall Councell to end questions, concerning which, neither side claimes any continued verball Tradition, and that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part are ready to receive such a definition, in as high a degree, as any Tradition whatsoever; They will be also confirmed by your denying Infallibilitie to a Councell, how generall soever, unapproved by the Pope, by seeing, that if (as you say) no man can be ignorant what he was taught when he was a childe, as the ground and substance of his hopes for all eternitie, and if in this, all your Religion were comprised (or else to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose say you this) then no man bred in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Church could erre, or ever have erred in matter of Faith, without knowing that he had departed from the very Basis of Christianitie, and for Instructions in these points, not onely all Authors, as Commenters upon Scripture, and the like, were wholly uselesse, but it were also a vaine thing, to goe for instruction even to Christs Vicar, and S. <hi>Hierome</hi> might have resolved his own question, about the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> every whit as well as
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:54903:112"/>
                  <hi>Damasus,</hi> or Saint <hi>Peter</hi> himselfe: And for the same reason, it were wholly impossible, that at the same time the Popes, and most notable, and most pious, and most learned Papists living, should have justified, and applauded <hi>Erasmus</hi> for the same workes (the one by his printed <hi>Diplomas,</hi> and the rest by their Letters) for which, at the same instant, the greatest part of the Monkes counted and proclaimed him a more pestilent Heretick then <hi>Luther,</hi> if they had all weighed heresie in the same ballance, and more impossible if in yours; which the learned will yet lesse ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of, when they see how soon the worse opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and lesser authoritie may prevaile, as how that of the Monkes hath done against that of the Popes, and Bishops, and that so much, that <hi>Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> is now generallie disavowed as no Catholicke, and given to us (whom wee accept as a great present) that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will allow him to be but halfe a Christian, and Cardinall <hi>Perron</hi> (which I am sorry for) gives a censure upon him, which would better have become the pen of a <hi>Latomus,</hi> a <hi>Bedda,</hi> a <hi>Stunica,</hi> or an <hi>Egmundane,</hi> then of so learned and judicious a Prelate.</p>
               <p>Now for the Ignorant, I am sure you will never be able to prove infalliblie to them, that your Church hath any prerogatives above others; the ordinarie way cannot be taken with them, because they not understanding the languages, in which the Fathers and Councels are written, cannot be press'd by what they cannot construe, and your way as little, because they are not more
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:54903:113"/>
(though totallie) ignorant of the Authors of past Ages, then they are of the state, opinions, and claimes of the present time; so that I know not how you can attempt them, if they have but a moderate understanding to their no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>The body of our Position shoots forth the branches <note place="margin">Object.</note> of divers Questions, or rather the Solutions of them: And first, how it happened, that divers Heretickes pretended to Tradition, as the <hi>Chiliasts, Gnosticks, Carpocratians,</hi> and divers others, yet they with their Traditions have been rejected, and the Church onely leftin claime of Tradition; For if we looke into what Catholicke Tradition is; and what the Herelicks pretended, the question will remaine voided. For the Catholicke Church cals Tradition, that Doctrine, which was publiquely delivered, and the Hereticks called Tradition, a kinde of secret Doctrine, either gathered out of private conversation with the Apostles, or rather pretended, that the Apostles, besides what they publiquely taught the world, had another mysticall way, proper to Schollers, more endeared, which came not to publique view, whereas the force and energie of a Tradition, resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the multitude of hearers, and being planted in the perpetuall life and actions of Christians, it must have such a publicity, that it cannot be unknown amongst them.</p>
               <p>Of the <hi>Carpocratians</hi> and <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> I have spoke <note place="margin">Resp</note> before, but sure for the <hi>Chiliasts</hi> this is onely said and not proved: Howsoever this undeniablie appeares, that either <hi>Pappias</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> thought
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:54903:113"/>
not this Tradition to have come such a way as you speake of, or else they thought it no here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall way, but such a one, as was (at least reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nablie) to be assented to; and both what was the way by which Traditions ought to come, and by which this came they were more likely to know, then those of following ages; which proves, that this Objection (as much as concernes them espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie) remaines still so strong, that (in spite of <hi>Fevardentius</hi>) it will be better to answer it, <hi>Scalpello quam Calamo,</hi> with a Pen-knife then with a Pen, and no Confuter will serve for it, but an <hi>Expurgatory Index,</hi> no <hi>non si tuus afforet Hector,</hi> if Cardinally <hi>Perron</hi> were alive.</p>
               <p>I must by the way take notice of what yon say here, that Tradition must have such a Publicity as cannot be unknown among Christians, and desire you to agree this with what you say in the next <hi>Paragraph,</hi> that the Apostles may not have preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in some Countries some Doctrines, which we now are bound to receive as Traditions, for sure those Doctrines were then unknown among many Christians; and if they had been necess ry, sure the Apostles would no where have forgot (wich so good a Prompter as the Holy Ghost) to have taught them; If they were not then necessary, how have they grown to be so since? Besides, I appeal to your Conscience, whether it appeart that the doctrine of the Exchequer of Superabundant merits, of which the Pope is Lord Treasurer, and by vertue of which he dispenseth his pardons to all the Soules in Purgatory, appear to have been known evern to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:54903:114"/>
any of the best Christians, and whether if it had been known to them as a Tradition, (being a Doctrine which necessitates at least Wisdome and Charity, a continuall practice of sueing for them, and of giving them) it were possible, that of what they knew, such infinite Volumes of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors should make no mention.</p>
               <p>Suppose some private Doctrine of an Apostle to <note place="margin">Object.</note> some Disciple should be published, and recorded by that Disciple, and some others, this might well be a Truth, but never obtain the force of a Catholique Position, that is, such as it would be a damnation to reject, because the descent from the Apostle is not notorious, and fit to sway the body of the whole Church.</p>
               <p>I confesse, that to have been no more generally <note place="margin">Resp.</note> delivered, will prove that the Apostles thought not such a Doctrine necessary, else their Charity would not have suffered them to have so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed it, but yet to any such Doctrine, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that any Christian, who believes the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that it came from the Apostles, should deny his assent, because it were to deny the Authority, upon which all the rest is grounded; for the Church pretends to her Authority from them, and not they from her, and howsoever, such a Doctrine (although not necessary) could not be damnable as you make this: Besides here will first arise a Question not easie to be decided, how great a multitude of Witnesses will serve to be notorious, and fit to sway the body of the Church, especially so many having not for a long while been thought fit even by Catholiques, though attesting doctrines
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:54903:114"/>
since received by you all, and considering that multitude of your Church, which believe the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate Conception in as high a degree, as it is possible without excommunicating the deniers, who either walk not by that which you count the onely Catholique Rule, or else claime such a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, who yet are not thought fit to sway the rest.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I pray observe how easie it was for the two first Ages, at least the chiefe of them, and all that are extant, to have given assent to Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons so unsufficiently testified, or to have mistaken Doctrines under that notion, (for so they did to this of the <hi>Chiliasts</hi>) and then after for it to spread till it were generall, land last as long as men last upon their authority, and when once it is so spread, how shall we then discover how small an Originall it had, when peradventure the head and spring of it will be as hard to find, as that of <hi>Nilus,</hi> so that the greatest part of what you receive, might possibly appear to be no certainer, nor bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter built, if we could digg to the foundation: Wherefore, since the delivery of a Tradition by subsequent Ages hath its validity onely from the authority of the first, me thinks you should either think that they received none but upon better grounds, or else think these grounds good.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I know not why you resolve this opinion of the <hi>Chiliasts,</hi> to have had onely such a private Tradition, for though they name <hi>John</hi> the Disciple, and mention certaine Priests who heard it from him, yet they deny not a moregeneraldelivery
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:54903:115"/>
of it, but peradventure least men might think that the generall opinion (that it came from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles) might arise from places of Scripture, (which fallacie, their testimony when not so fully expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, was still in danger of concerning any point, but that these books were written by these men) they therefore thought it fit to name to us their witnesses, that it came from Christs owne mouth, and in what words: And if they had done so much on your side, for the differences between us, I believe you would now have few Protestant ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries left, for you would have converted the greater part, and by that have been enabled to burn the smaller.</p>
               <p>The second Question may be, How it cometh to <note place="margin">Object.</note> passe, that some things, which at first bindes not the Churches beliefe, afterwards commeth to bind it? For if it were ever a Tradition, it ever must needs be publique, and ever bind the Church, and if once it were not, it appears not how ever it could come to be, for if this age for example have it not, how can it deliver it to the next that followeth? But if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that the scope of Christian Doctrine being great, and the Apostles preaching in so great varieties of Countries, it might happen some point in one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try might be lesse understood, or peradventure not preacht, which in another was often preacht, and well both understood and retained, we may easily free our selves from these brambles: For the Spirit of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition residing in this, that the testimony be <hi>excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione majus,</hi> and beyond all danger of deceit. It is not necessary to the efficaciousnesse of Tradition, that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54903:115"/>
the whole universall Church should be witnesse to such a truth, but so great a part as could be a warrant against mistaking; so that if all the Churches of <hi>Asia, Greece,</hi> or <hi>Affrick,</hi> or <hi>AEgypt,</hi> should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly affirm such a Tradition to have been delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them from the Apostles, it were enough to make a Doctrine <hi>exceptione majorem:</hi> Whence it ensueth, that if in a meeting of the universall Church it were found, that such a part hath such a Tradition concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning some matter, whereof the rest had either no understanding, or no certainty, such a Doctrine would passe into a necessary bond of Faith in the whole Church.</p>
               <p>Your sword is so sharp, and your shield so weak, <note place="margin">Resp.</note> that I can hardly believe they came out of the same forge, but when I observe how much you have a better right hand then a left, and that not onely you have raised an objection which you cannot lay, but your answer to it multiplies more, I cannot <note place="margin">Philos.</note> but compare you to him in <hi>Lucian,</hi> who travelling with a Magician that had no servant, and instead of one was daily wont to say to a Pestle, Pestle be thou a man, and it would be so, and when his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions were served, would bid it return to be a Pestle, and was obeyed, thought one time to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Magitian, he being abroad, and made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Pestle a man, and draw water, but could not make it return to the former state, but it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued still to draw, wherefore angry and afraid, he took up an axe and clove the Pestle-man in two, whereupon <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in stead of one water-drawer there lept up two: For first I pray
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54903:116"/>
consider, what could you have found more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to destroy all, which you had before laboured to settle, about the Infallibilitie of your Tradition, then this distincton of <hi>Exceptione Major,</hi> since, if not a generall one, but one which seemed such, were required, how easie was it for false opinions to get in, under that colour, testified but by a few reputed honest men, and so received by, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted from others of great and generall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Secondlie, how could you have found a better way to answer your owne Objection against the <hi>Chiliasts</hi> Tradition, for want of being suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientlie publique, since if that had not seemed to them to have had this condition (I mean, if they had thought they should for this cause have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted against it) it had been impossible these Saints should have received it, and concerning the publicitie of it, and the number and authoritie of the deliverers, they must of necessitie have been the best Judges who then lived, and who were the more considerable Doctors of the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Ages: so that you must either confesse, that a Tradition bindes not unlesse indeed gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, or confesse that this doth, supposing this not to have been generall, which you cannot prove.</p>
               <p>A likely example of this may be drawn from the <note place="margin">Object.</note> Canonicall Bookes.</p>
               <p>I deny it to be now necessarie to Salvation, to <note place="margin">Resp.</note> admit of any Bookes for Canonicall, which it was lawfull for Christians in past ages to doubt of, and which had no generall Tradition; and againe, this
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:54903:116"/>
answer helpes against your selfe: for it is plaine by Saint <hi>Hieromes</hi> Testimonie, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church received not the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> which the <hi>Easterne</hi> Churches received (whose Testimonie, according to your grounds, she then should have beleeved to be beyond exception) and it is plaine by <hi>Perrons</hi> Testimonie, that the <hi>Easterne</hi> Churches received not the <hi>Macchabees,</hi> when he saies, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did. Now it is plaine, that the Receivers pretended to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, because nothing else could make a booke thought Canonicall, whereas other opinions might be brought in by a false Interpretation of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and after being spread, might be thought to come from Tradition: So that according to your grounds and these testimonies, not onely the <hi>Westerne</hi> Church ought to have beleeved the <hi>Easterne</hi> about the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> and the <hi>Easterne</hi> the <hi>Westerne</hi> about the <hi>Macchabees,</hi> but also they ought to have required this assent from each other, which they not doing (as they would have done, if they had thought their testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie so valid as you doe) it followes, that you doe differ from the Churches of the fifth and sixth age, about what is <hi>exceptione majus,</hi> you thinking that to be so, which they thought not, and againe, from all the extant Doctors of the two first ages, you thinking that not so, which they thought was, as also those two times agreed about it, as little with each other, as you with them both.</p>
               <p>The third question may be, how Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion <note place="margin">Object.</note> (consisting of so many points) is possible to
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:54903:117"/>
be kept uncorrupted by Tradition, which depending upon Memory, and our memory being so fraile, it seemeth, cannot without manifest miracle conserve so great a diversity of points unchanged for so many ages. But if we consider, that Faith is a Science, a thing, whose parts are so connexed that if one be false, all must needs be false, we shall easily see, that contrarily, the multitude of divers points is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, the one to the right, the other wherein we doubt.</p>
               <p>As in <hi>Judges,</hi> when a battell was to be fought <note place="margin">Resp.</note> between the children of <hi>Israel</hi> and the <hi>Midianites,</hi> the <hi>Midianites</hi> destroyed each other, and left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe for <hi>Israel,</hi> but onely to pursue them: so truly, your Objections worke so strongly upon your own Party, that I have nothing left me to presse, and much to applaud: For for this very reason, I beleeve, that all necessarie points were given in writing, and onely the witnessing, that these were the Apostles writings, was left to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which was both much lesse subject to error (as being but one point, and that a matter of fact) and could no other way be done, because no wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting could have witnessed for it selfe so sufficientlie, that we should have had reason to have beleeved it upon no other certificates, and to this your answer seemes to me no way satisfactorie, since, first, I deny Faith to be a Science, it being nothing but an assent to Gods Revelations, neither are those so connexed as you liberallic affirme, and sparinglie prove, Nay, suppose they were, yet though errors would be the lesse likely to enter,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54903:117"/>
yet when any one, by any meanes were got in' then this connexion would be a ready way to helpe it to let in all its fellowes. Besides, those opinions which may be superinduct as Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which such a connexion could not hinder, if they were not contrarie to the true ones; and of this sort is chiefly our question.</p>
               <p>That therefore you are no better able to wind your selfe out of this inextricable Labyrinth, is no wonder to me, and no disgrace to you, since a man may as well be a good Logician, though he cannot solve an unsolvable question, as he may be exceedinglie skilled in Physick, and yet not able to cure an incurable disease; Besides, that these Objections arose so at the first sight, out of what was to be considered, that it was as impossible for to avoid them, as to answer them.</p>
               <p>Let us consider in constant Nations, their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <note place="margin">Object.</note> their habits, &amp;c. how long they continue among them.</p>
               <p>Truly there is no Nation that I know, whose <note place="margin">Resp.</note> language hath not, and doth not daily palpablie suffer change. Consider, that of these <hi>English</hi> hourely denizoning words of all kinde of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, these of the <hi>Spaniards, Italians,</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> almost made up out of Latine, and that of the ancient <hi>Greekes,</hi> unknown to those of this Age, unlesse they learn it at Schoole: Habits indeed some Nations alter lesse, but some daily, and none change not sometimes: But this is little to the purpose, since those Nations which have remained very constant in things, which no considerable

For when the reasons are probable (as they may be for a falshood) the Persons pressing them, in themselves of authority (as they may be and yet erre) and the people to whom they are prest, full of esteeme of their Teachers, then meet the three waies of working perswasion which <hi>Aristotle</hi> mentions, whereof <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Truely I thank you Sir for this example, since <note place="margin">Resp.</note> it puts me in mind of an Objection, which else I had utterly forgot: Many of those errors which they hold, (as the <hi>Cabala</hi> and others) I pray, upon what other ground hold they them then this, that they have been taught. <hi>Mases</hi> delivered them to their Fathers, as unwritten Traditions, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

that Notion they have descended: Now may not they defend themselves in them, by the very same Arguments which you use in this Treatise for the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> May not they say that they have received them from their Fathers, who received them from theirs, who must either have joyned in mistaking their Ancestors, or in inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to deceive their Posterity, whereof neither is credible: May not they say, what is said of these last Ages, may be said upwards and upwards, till they come to that, wherein their Fathers received these Doctrines from <hi>Moses,</hi> who was <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> as worthy of credit in the delivery of these, as in that of the ten Commandements, and their Fathers witnesses beyond exception, that these Doctrines be delivered: May they not ask you in what year or age, these errors entered among them, and say it is evidently true, that then their whole Church conspired to tell a lie. May they not bid you besides consider the Notoriousnesse of the lie? such as he is very rarely found, who is so wicked as to venture upon, besides the greatness of the subject, and the damage ensuing to himself and his dearest Pledges: May they not adde, that the multitude of their Church is so dispersed through so many Countries and Languages, that it is impossible they should agree together upon a false determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to affirm a falshood for a truth, no Interest being able to be common to them all to produce such an effect: This they may say, and if they do, and retort your own words upon your self, I know not truely what new ones you will find to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:54903:119"/>
answer them in, unlesse you change the whole course you now steere, and come about the same way which I now use to you, that is, shewing by what waies such an opinion may have spread among them, although not at first received, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out of their owne Authors, that this hath not been alwaies held a Tradition among them, though now so accounted, which is sometimes (as I remember) your owne <hi>Galatinus</hi> his way, and the best that is: But if to that they should againe reply out of your own words (the Names onely changed) that if what <hi>Moses</hi> delivered were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely true, and what he delivered be to be seen in what they beleeved who heard him, and so till now, it is evident, that they who seek for truth in learned discourses, must needs forego the most certaine and easie way of attaining what they aime at: That <hi>Jew,</hi> who should retort this, and much more of this kind upon you, and keep you to Tradition, and make their present Tradition (upon your grounds) the Judge of that, I am of opinion, would make you as silent, as if (according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb) you had seen a Wolf first, or were a <hi>Pitha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goricall-Freshman,</hi> and you would wish you had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver put into an enemies hand such a weapon against your self, as this present discourse: So that in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Comnenas</hi> Phrase <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>To your example of the answer to the King of <hi>Socotora,</hi> I answer,</p>
               <p>That either those hererodox Christians had been at first converted by Hereticks, or by Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques; If by Catholiques, (and your Church be that, and your grounds be hers) then it is plaine, that men may grow into great error, who hold fast, as they think upon Tradition, and may swerve from that Rule, whilst they think they walk by it: If by Hereticks, then it seemes Catholiques (as you call them) are not the onely Religion that have
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54903:120"/>
converted Nations, and that note of the Church which isso daily and so eagerly prest, appeares com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to more then it: And so you may take which horne of my Dilemma you please.</p>
               <p>To come at length to give an answer to him that <note place="margin">Object.</note> demands a guide at my hands, I remit him to the moderne Visibe Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that is, her who is in an externe sensible communion with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne sensible Clergie of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the externe sensible Head, and Pastor of that Church. If he ask me, how he shall know her, I must counter inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate him, who he is. Is he an ignorant man? is he unlearned, yet of good understanding in the World? Is he a Scholer, and what Scholer? A Grammarian, whose undrstanding hath no other help then that of Languages? Is he a Philosopher? Is he a Divine? (I mean an Academicall one, for a true Divine is to teach not to ask this Question) Is he a Statesman? For he that can think one answer can, or ought to be made to all these, may likewise expect, that one cause may produce all effects: Yet I deny not but all must have the same guide, though they are to be assured of that guide in divers manners.</p>
               <p>I confesse Sir, you come to the Demander but <note place="margin">Resp.</note> at length, for till I had read further, I had not known that your Treatise was intended for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to mine, if I had not been told so when it was given me. For hitherto, as <hi>Baash</hi> a King of <hi>Israel,</hi> in the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> when he came against <hi>Judah,</hi> assail'd not their Cities, but built <hi>Ramoth</hi> against them, so you have not attempted to destroy what I had said, but raised another consideration, a
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:54903:120"/>
City, a <hi>Ramoth</hi> of your own; against which I have brought such battery, as seemes to me suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to demollish it.</p>
               <p>Now for your directions to a guide, I answer, supposing that there is one, and that this you speak of be now it, (for you will not say she alwaies is) and not to quarrell with you for giving me an acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and mutable guide, that being a thing which you suppose so necessary to be alwaies known, I will joyn issue upon this with you, whether she be to be known to be a guide by any Infallible Notes, for such are required by reason to beget such an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, as is required by you, all other being tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by your selves, not Faith, but Opinion. To your Contra-interrogation therefore who I am, that is, in whose Name I speak, I answer and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse my self one of the notably ignorant, but though I act my own part onely, when I speak in his person, yet for once I will adventure to answer you, in the name of the severall persons you speak of, and will shew, that none of them have suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cause to receive the guide which you propose upon the reasons which you alleadge.</p>
               <p>If the ignorant man speaketh, I will shew him in <note place="margin">Object.</note> the Church of God decencie, and Majestie of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, above all other Sects and Religions, whereby dull capacities are sweetly ensnared to beleeve the truth they heare, from those whom they see to have the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward signes of Vertue and Devotion.</p>
               <p>To this I answer, in the ignorant mans person <note place="margin">Resp.</note> (that is in my own) thus, I for my part, neither see what you say you shew me, (for in all decency and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:54903:121"/>
Majestie of ceremonies, the Kings Chappell seems to me to equall the Queens, and our Cathedrall Churches, much to surpasse your cock-lofts) and if I did, yet the decency of them would not prove your Church to be a good guide, so well as a good mistresse of ceremonies, and if by their majestie you mean their Magnificence, then that would one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove her rich and not orthodox, since this is such a note, that (her doctrine remaining as true as it is) one persecution would serve to destroy it; and with it, all that meanes which you allow the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant to find his guide by; And whereas you say, that dull capacities are by this sweetly ensnared to beleeve the Truth; I answer, that by the same meanes they may be as sweetly, and as easily ensna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to beleeve falshoods, unlesse you could shew that Majestie and Truth are inseparable Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
               <p>If the unlearned ask, I shew him the claime of <note place="margin">Object.</note> Antiquity, the multitude, the advantages of Sanct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and Learning, how the World was once of this accord, and those who opposed, when they first parted, first began the contrary Sects, how the points of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be such, as on the Catholique side help devotion, and on the contrary side diminish the same, and such like sensible differences, which will clearly shew an advantage on the Catholiques side, which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionall motive to his understanding.</p>
               <p>I see indeed you claime Antiquitie, but do you <note place="margin">Resp.</note> think it reasonable that I should take your word. Our Divines (whom because I know more, I have more cause to trust then you, in a case of which I
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54903:121"/>
my self can take no cognizance) absolutely deny it, and to me you cannot disprove them, unlesse I had at least some learning to enable me to judge, who quotes that trulie which now I cannot construe: For multitude, I find not what that proves, it may work upon my feare rather then upon my assent, yet I am told, that many more Christians disagree from your Church in this maine Question of her being a guide, then she consists of; that the <hi>Turks</hi> are more then both, and the <hi>Pagans</hi> more then all three, so that if they relate the state of the world aright, multitude must rather seem an argument against truth then for it: And forasmuch as I can see my self, your Religion is the least in this Kingdome, and I know no other: For the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of sanctitie and learning, to the first I answer, that since in a Countrie where the State is their adversarie, and where for feare of scandale, and hope of gaining numbers to their Church, (to help both to the suretie and ornament of it) by commending their Doctrine by their lives, in likelyhood they are more vigilant against vice, then where they have no such thornes against their brests to keep them awak, even here I can find no such advantage as you pretend, I have no cause to guesse that I should find it where the incitement of emulation and such like, are absent, and the charmes of greatnesse, wealth, power, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence likelyhood of impunity are present: For the advantage of learning, I answer, that speaking to me with the fore-knowledge of my being unlearned, I wonder you should make
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54903:122"/>
use of such a motive, which (how true soever it were in it self) I am not capable of discerning to be so, any more then a blind man is likely to assent to an argument drawn from Colours, of which he could have no possible notion. Now whereas you say that the world was once of this accord, it is more then I know: we are told that wholeChurches in the <hi>East,</hi> had long denied this, when <hi>Luther</hi> first left you, and howsoever that it could not be brought in time by arts, propt by power to accord in an error, is more then you have proved. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you say, that those, who opposed this, when they first parted, first began the contrary Sects: I answer, that our men pretend that they began no new Doctrine, but onely scoured off the rust which time and worldly ends in some, and negligence in others, had suffered to grow on. Which Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againe remaines to be tried, (if you refuse Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as your side useth to do) by a Jury of such who are for the most part untranslated, or those which are by Parties) and whose language I cannot spell, nor consequently determine by their evidence: Now whereas you say, that the points in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie on your side help Devotion, and on ours di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish it, I wish you had instanced which, and wherein, for I for the most part see nothing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, they being meere speculative opinions, and not reduceable to life, as especially this where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we most differ, which is your Churches being a generall guide: Those, which most may seem such, are either Confession, (which yet we denie onely to be necessary, not profitable, if well used,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:54903:122"/>
which is practised by some of us, and recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to all, and which as you have tempered it, making contrition sufficient for his salvation, who hath till his hour of death lived in all sin, and making attrition with absolution of the same force as contrition, and requiring to attrition, (as I am told you do) onely sorrow for sin, though arising from the feare of Hell, so some love of God being joyned to it, which none can want but an Infidell) will not help Devotion much, but rather dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish it) or Monastick life, (which was grown into great excesse and disorder, which yet many wise and moderne Protestants think might as well have been reformed as the other parts of the Church, without totall obolition, and so upon this is left no Question) or Fasting, (which if you think Protestants are against, I pray read Bishop <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi> his Lent Sermons, and which if it be not so much used among us as it should, is not so much the fault of the Religion, as of the Men) and all these things considered, I find none of your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to shew a maine advantage on your side, and therefore I have yet no cause to leave my owne: And if in some of these things you should seeme to have more Truth then we, yet that would not free you from having more error in other points then this comes to, much lesse from having any at all, without the beliefe of which, I should not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived among you, though I were willing to come: And this lieth upon you to prove, and that not by probable, but by infallible arguments, if you require (as they say your side useth to do) an assent of that Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:54903:123"/>
To the Grammarian I will give two Memorandums; <note place="margin">Object.</note> first, that seeing the Catholicks were first in possession both of the Scriptures, and the Interpretations: The adverse part is bound to bring such places as can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no probable Exposition by the Catholickes. For who knoweth not, that is conversant in Criticks, how many obscure and difficult places occurre in most plaine Authors, and the Scripture of all Bookes (the greater part of the men that wrote them, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the New Testament, being not eloquent, and writing not in their native Tongue) for the most part, are subject to much impropriety: The other Memorandum is, that, to prove a Catholique point by Scripture, it is sufficient, that the place brought, beare the Exposition the Catholique giveth, and if it be the more probable by the very letter, it is an evincent place. The reason is, because the question being of a Christian law, the Axiome of the Jurists taketh place, that <hi>Consuetudo optima Interpres Legis,</hi> so that if it be manifest, that Christian practise (which was before the controversie) bee for the one sence, and the words be tolerable, no force of Grammer can prevaile to equalize this advantage: The Grammarian therefore, who will observe these Rules, I turne him loose to the Scriptures and Fathers, to seeke there what is the Faith of Christ and proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of her Church to know her by.</p>
               <p>To your first Memorandum, I answer, that <note place="margin">Resp.</note> you have grounded it wholly upon begging the question: for if those of your Religion had first been in possession of the Scriptures, then the Christians had been of it in the Apostles times,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:54903:123"/>
which if you could prove, you would need to prove no more, but all would easilie follow: and then for your consequence, that is equallie false, for though I confesse, to make any Doctrine a point of Faith, it is required, that the place be as plaine as you please, yet to the making it the more probable opinion (and consequentlie excluding the contrarie from being necessarie) so much is not required. The greatest cause of the obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of those bookes, in which Criticks are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant, is the negligence and ignorance of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribers, so that some Authors would scarce know their own Bookes, if they were revived, whereas the great care of Christians about so deare a pledge, hath much, if not wholly hindered, the same cause from perverting, and so obscuring Scripture: At least, if it have not, it seemes your Church is not so faithfull a Guardian of her deposit, as her deare friends (moved by partiallitie or ends) would make us beleeve: Besides, till now I ever thought, that Eloquence rather lead men to speake impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlie, then the want of it, since ignorant persons keepe themselves within the bounds of what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciselie they meane, whereas the eloquent wander into figures, which are so many, and have gotten such footing in language (whilst in the search of significancie proprietie is lost) that those, who use them, are obliged to those who will please to understand, because all they say may beare two sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the one proper, the other improper: And though it be true, that they have over-flowne, even into the language of the ignorant, yet it is as true,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:54903:124"/>
that both they are much lesse used among these, and that they had not hence their beginning, but from Eloquence: And though the Apostles write not in their native Tongues, yet they write in an inspired language, so that they were not likely to commit, at least, any such soloecismes as should destroy the end of the Inspirer, which was, that they should be understood by it.</p>
               <p>To your second Memorandum I answer, that since every man is free till some thing binds him, you (who pretend, that we are bound to receive more doctrine as necessarie, then appeares to us to be so) are in all reason to give us plainlie evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent proofe, that what you thus require, God requires too, for till then (to returne you to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Axiome, for yours) <hi>praesumitur pro libertate</hi> whereas wee (the burden of the Negative proofe not lying upon us) if we bring probable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we doe it <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> and bring more then we need to bring; And whereas you stand upon Customes, having power in Law matters, I answer, that in all cases that is not of force, for we hold, that it must not prevaile against a Statute, which shewes, that they may be contradictorie, and as <hi>Nullum tempus occurrit Regi,</hi> is thought to be a good civill topicall Law, so me thinkes, <hi>Nullum tempus occurrit veritati,</hi> is a good publique divinitie Law, your owne Scripture too telling us, that Truth is stronger then the King; Besides, where it is of force, it is in such cases as the law hath appointed that it should be so, and if you can prove out of Christs Law, that there it is so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:54903:124"/>
to be in matters of Divinity, wee shall willinglie yeild, but seeing that our law, which allowes this force to custome, sets downe also in how long time it is, before it become of force, and I have cause to thinke, that Christ would have been as carefull as our law, and have set down this too, if he had had any such meaning, and if it were setled to be a custome of such a standing (as by Saint <hi>Austine</hi> sometimes is spoken of) as that in no time it be known that ever it was otherwise; in most of your affaires this would stead you a little, though one side have burnt the evidences of the other, to which in likeliehood you owe it, if this stead you in any; of questions, whereof Scripture and Antiquitie are wholly silent, or meerly speculative, and unreducible unto act (of which sort are the greatest between us) or not concerning the lawfulnesse, but the necessity of an Action, to the first kind no ancient custome can belong, nor other to the others then a custome of Interpretation of some text concerning it, not enough to conclude upon (besides, that it is not that which you speake of) since daily your men differ, and defend their differing from all that went before them, about more then many texts, as <hi>Cajetane, Salmeron,</hi> and <hi>Maldonate</hi> shall beare me witnesse, unlesse, like <hi>Sampson,</hi> you may breake those Ropes by which others must be bound: And adding to all this, that our custome may serve to shew the meaning of the law, when our selves were Authors of it, though not when God is, and that our generall custome arguing our united consent (which
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:54903:125"/>
onely gives force to our lawes) may be as fit to bind, as a law in civill cases, and yet not in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, where the lawes proceed from a higher foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that such a rule may be good in civill reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, which require but probable proofes, and yet not in divine ones, where (according to the grounds of your Party, which requires an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubting assent to her doctrines as infallible) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible proofes are necessary, especially this, like other Topycall arguments, having onely force <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> and againe good where it is not so necessary, that the will of the Legislator be followed, as that peace and quiet be preserved, to which, all alterations, even to the better, are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and yet not in these cases, where we are to prefer the will of our Law-maker before any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane convenience, or good, if the custome past unquestioned, when the Law was first promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but not, if crept in after by negligence, or plainely appearing to have been brought in by power, all this perswading me not to be so farr swaied by your Rules as you would have me, I suppose you have small hope, that not being so, I should find either in Scripture, or the first An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie, either that Faith which your Church pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth, or these properties of Christs Church, by which your Church proves, or rather strives to prove, that she it is: Give me leave besides to aske you one Question, and that is, What we shall conclude when the Christian practice of severall places have ever differed, as that of <hi>Greece</hi> from that of <hi>Rome,</hi> which it may also do in more places then
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:54903:125"/>
we are acquainted with, the extent of Christianitie being unknown to us, as are the customes of some remote Christian Countries which we know.</p>
               <p>Of the Philosopher, I exact to goe like a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, <note place="margin">Object.</note> and to search out the specificall differences of every Sect, and when he hath found them (if any one but the Catholique hath any rule of faith and good life, which I remit to him to enquire) but at least, when he hath found the Catholicks to be this claime of Tradition before declared, then if this doe not bring him as demonstratively as he knoweth any Conclusion in Philosophy, and Mathematicks, to the notice of this, is the onely true Church of Christ, for my part I shall quit him before God and Man.</p>

               <p>The Divine, if he hath truly understood the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples <note place="margin">Object.</note> of Faith in the nature of a Divine, I mean Trinity, Incarnation, Redemption, Eucharist, Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, the Creation and Dissolution of the World, and hath seen the exact conformity of the deepest Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Nature, with an unspeakable wisdome of the Contriver: If he doth not plainely confesse it was above the naure of man to frame the Catholique Religion, and seeth not that onely that is conformable to Nature, and it self, I say, he hath no ground suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to be of it.</p>
               <p>Supposing the greatest part of what you say <note place="margin">Resp.</note> to be true, (for I see not how a bare consideration even of these Doctrines will serve to prove them to come from Gods Revelation) it might prove the Christian Religion against <hi>Pagans,</hi> but for yours against <hi>Protestants,</hi> I can draw out of it no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which if upon your explanation, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares

not to be through the default of the <hi>Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck</hi> (which I expect) then the better I think of you, the worse I shall think of your cause, which would have ministred to so sharp an inquirer, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proofes, but that the old <hi>Axiom</hi> hindered it of, <hi>Nihil dat quod non habet:</hi> These Principles of Faith you speak of, are agreed on by both Parts, so out of their Truth, and the impossibility of their being forged, all the other points cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, which have upon them no necessarie depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance: and that your Religion is conformable to the deepest Principles of Nature, I am so farr from seeing, that I conceive your own opinion of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation contradicts them almost all: Neither see I any such unspeakablenesse in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving, but that ordinary understandings by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall degrees, in a long tract of many ignorant negligent ages, egged on by ambition, cloakt over by hipocrisie, assisted by false miracles, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by tyrannie, might easily both induce and establish them, so that though we have hitherto differed in our premisses, yet we meet in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, which is, that I have no sufficient ground to be of your Religion.</p>
               <p>The Statesman, who is truely informed of the <note place="margin">Object.</note> Church, how farr is really of Christs institution, and what either pious men have added, or peradventure ambitious men encroacht, if he doth not find a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of so high and exotick straine, that neither mans wit dare to have attempted it, neither mans power would possibly have effected it; If he find no emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent helpes, and no disadvantage to the temporall

               <p>I find so much policie in your Church, for most part really, and alwaies in <hi>voto,</hi> aimed at, although miss'd, that of no body of men did ever <hi>Aristotl's</hi> saying appear to me truer, <gap reason="foreign">

of your Church I could not be informed in this, who hath not decided the Question) but nothing that you alone hold instituted by Christ, and so to your <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> for want of a starr I am not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to travell.</p>
               <p>Let every man consider which is the fit way for <note place="margin">Object.</note> himself, and what in other matter of that way he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth evidence, and if there be no interest in his soule to make him loath to believe, what in another matter of the like nature he would not stick at, or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie to practise what he seeth clearly enough; I feare not his choice; but if God send him time and meanes to prosecute his search any indifferent while, it is long agoe known of what Religion he is to be of.</p>
               <p>I see yet no cause to think that your Religion <note place="margin">Resp.</note> is that which will be chosen, though we agree about the state, in which every enquirers soule ought to be, and in which those of few are; I see all parents labour to fix opinions into their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren before they cometo an age fit to judge of any greater doubts, then what may happen at span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, or cherry pit, and they againe seldome labour to set right what Education hath swared: Neither are they wrought upon onely by preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, but some because of gaine like <hi>Demetrius,</hi>

This I insist upon the more, because I think we have more cause to put you in mind of this, then you us, being too little practised on both parts, but not most by yours, whereof the greatest part com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly arrives not so farr, as at the fault of not
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:54903:128"/>
seeking as they should, because commonly they have not leave given them to seek at all: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides those who neglect to seek and may, no Bible being allowed by you to most, as no Smith was suffered by the <hi>Philistines</hi> in <hi>Israel,</hi> they fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing least the <hi>Hebrews</hi> should make them swords and speares, and you least they should make out of it, Arguments to perswade them to revolt from you.

And truely if thus it were not, if all had liberty to seek Truth, and if all who sought it were indifferent in their seeking, and their judgments were absolutely unbridled by their affections, and unswaied by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, I cannot perswade my self that so many could meet in thinking it fit to receive (for so they seem to me) such impossible Doctrines upon such improbable grounds, or to require a more then probable assent to but probable Doctrines, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them to be such) and should not see what is grounded upon them, (if not impossible) is at least much more improbable, then the Motives are probable, which kind of Assent cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by God, who as he requires onely <gap reason="foreign">

               <head>Here followeth the Third Part of this Discourse, which is a Reply to such Answers as you have been pleased to make to a little of that little, which I at first opposed.</head>
               <p>SPeaking of the Church <hi>Rome,</hi> as this day it is the <note place="margin">Resp.</note> true Church of God. I answer the doubter, she neither hath, nor can have any error which he need to feare, and be shie of.</p>
               <p>The which two limitations I adde, for avoiding Questions impertinent unto our businesse.</p>
               <p>The first, for those which concerneth the connexion of the Sca of <hi>Rome</hi> to the Universall.</p>
               <p>The latter, to avoide such Questions as touch that point, whether the Church may erre in any Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call or other such matter, which Questions are not so pertinent to our Matter.</p>
               <p>Meaning by the true Church a companie of men, which hold all (and no more) that Christ taught (for other interpretation, I beleeve, you will not give it) then there is no question, but that not onely it hath no dangerous error, but none at all; but that yours is such remaines unproved, and I beleeve, <hi>manet aeternumque manebit.</hi> For upon examination, I doubt not, it will appeare, that as I have read of a Cohort of <hi>Persians,</hi> which they called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Immortall Cohort, which all died in one battell; so your infallibe
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:54903:129"/>
Church will be found to abound in errors, and to belie equallie hertitle, being troubled her selfe, with what she undertakes to secure others from, like the Apothecary in <hi>Lucian,</hi> who undertaking to cure all men of the Cough, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> could himselfe scarce prescribe his Medicine for coughing the while. Besides, of what sort soever the error be, yet since the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of her Communion is to professe a beleife that she hath none, such a one as to them, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed beleeve so, would not be dangerous, yet to me, who cannot professe this but against my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, how slight a one soever, may be an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of damnation: Againe, as to me your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer appeares false, so to those of your own side it will appeare hereticall; to me it would give no satisfaction (though you had proved what you but affirme) because I desire to know an eternall, not a temporarie Guide, whereas if in your Church there should happen any Schisme, your answer then would give me no meanes to resolve my selfe which part were the guide (that is the true Church) without a new, and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture (by the way) an endlesse search. To them it will give scandall, because, first, you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose that we must know the Church by the Doctrine, and the Doctrine by the Church; and secondlie, you imply a possibilitie, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is now but by accident (and may come not to be) the true Church, and so all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence built upon her, as the Directresse of all Churches, and the eternall Admirall of Gods
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:54903:130"/>
Fleet will appeare to have a very fallible foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: Besides, in the cause of your Limitation I find more reason to commend your Discretion, then your Ingenuitie: for, for the first, if you had said, that the Universall Church of Christ must alwaies be connected to the particular one of <hi>Rome,</hi> which were to allow her Infallibilitie, you knew Antiquitie to have said much against you; and besides, that this being not yet <hi>de fide</hi> among your selves (nor evident in it selfe) could not serve for a foundation to the whole bodie of our faith; if you had absolutelie denied it, you knew, that you should incurre the displeasure of the most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing part of your own men, and that then the maine (and to the Ignorant the onely, visible) signe would bee taken away. For the second, if you had affirmed, that the Church could erre in nothing, how slight soever, you would both have contradicted many of your own side, as <hi>Stapleton</hi> by name, and have asserted more then there were any coloun of proofe for, and would have wanted this distinction to retire to: if you were confuted in any particular, if you had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained her Infallibilitie to things necessarie, or weightie, or the like, then the question would again have risen, which are those (for many errors, which we lay to her charge, concerne not things indeed necessarie, though she adde to the error, that other of thinking, that whatsoever she holds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes necessarie by her holding it) and then for all you have said, the doctrine of Purgatorie might be false, and yet she the Church, and that infallible,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:54903:130"/>
as farre as by your Doctrine her Infallibilitie had need to be extended.</p>
               <p>Neither doe I remit the questioner to Scripture for <note place="margin">Resp.</note> his satisfaction, although I hold Scripture a very sufficient meanes to satisfie the man, who goeth to it with that preparation of understanding and will which is meet and required. Howsoever this I may answer for them who prove it out of Scripture, that because they dispute against them who admit of Scripture, and deny the authority of the Church, if they can convince it, they doe well, though they will not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves admit generally of a proofe out of Scripture, as not able to prove every thing in <hi>foro conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioso.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you hold Scripture to be so sufficient a mean, <note place="margin">Repl.</note> I wonder, Sir, why you thinke not fit to remit me to it, unlesse you thinke, that you have severall sufficient waies to prove so evidenta Truth by, or thinke me not to come with meet preparation: Indeed if that be (as among you it is counted) to come resolved, not to judge of what the <hi>Roman</hi> Church holds, by what the Scriptures say, but to beleeve, that they say whatsoever she holds, then I confesse, I come not with the Conditions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; but if it be to come desirous to finde the Truth, and to follow and professe it when I have found it, in spite of all temporall respects, which might either fright or allure me from so doing, then I suppose, that Charitie (which hopeth all things) will encline you to beleeve, that I come as I ought to come, untill some evident reason perswade you to the contrarie: That the Scripture
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:54903:131"/>
cannot prove every thing in <hi>foro contentioso</hi> I beleeve, but all necessarie Truths, I beleeve it can; for onely those, which it can, are such: I denie not, but that a contentious person may denie a thing to be proved, when his own Conscience contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts his words, but so he may Arguments drawn from any other ground as well as Scripture, so that if for that cause you refuse to admit of proofes from thence, you might as well for the same, refuse to admit of any by any other kinde of Arguments: And certainlie, if the Scriptures (I meane the plaine places of it) cannot be a sufficient ground for such and such a point, surelie it cannot be a sufficient ground to build a ground upon, as the Churches Infallibilitie, and therefore, though it it seemes you desire so much that this be beleeved, that so it be, you care not upon what proofe, yet a considering Protestant, who is not as hot to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your Religion, as you are that he should, may presentlie say, when he is press'd by you with Scripture to this, since this is a way of proofe which your selves admit not of, an Argument from hence may bring me from my own Religion, but never to yours, because it is a beame which that relies much upon, that by any other way, then the authoritie of the Church, no man can be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientlie sure of the meaning of Scripture.</p>
               <p>That they say, the Church is made infallible that <note place="margin">Resp.</note> we may have some guide, I thinke it very rationall; for Nature hath given ever some strong, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable Principle in all Natures to guide the rest. The Common-wealth hath a Governour not
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:54903:131"/>
questionable, our Understanding hath Principles which she cannot judge, but by them judgeth of all other verities. If there should not be some Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in the Church, it were the onely maimed thing God had created, and maimed in its Principall part, in the very head. Andif there be such a Principle, the whole Church is Infallible by that, as the whole man seeth by his eyes, toucheth by his hands.</p>
               <p>Christ is our unquestionable, and infallible <note place="margin">Repl.</note> Governour, and his Will the Principle by which we are guided, and the Scripture the place where this Will is contained, which if we endeavour to find there, we shall be excused, though we chance to misse, and therefore want not your guide, (who either is not, or as hard to find as the way: and againe, when he hath defined, the certaine mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that definition, as hard to find as herfelf.) Neither is a company of men thus beleeving, maimed in the head, though having no other more uncontroulable Principle: If your guide were evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of her self, as those Principles are by which we judge all things else, then your Similitude would hold a little, whereas being neither knowable in her self, nor proveable by ought else, what you have said onely shewes, what an ill match is made, when Witt is set against Truth.</p>
               <p>It is sufficient for a Child to believe his Parents, <note place="margin">Resp.</note> for a Clown to believe his Preacher about the Churches Infallibility: For Faith is given to mankind, to be a meanes of believing, and living like a Christian, and so he hath this second, it is not much matter in what tearmes he be with the first.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:54903:132"/>
To what you say, I answer, that I confesse <note place="margin">Repl.</note> that it is not possible that without particular Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, or Inspirations, the ignorant, even of the Orthodox party, should receive their Religion upon very strong grounds, (which makes me wonder, that even from them you should exact an assent of a higher nature, and a much greater certaintie, then can be ministred to them by any arguments which they are capable of) yet if they believe what they receive, with an intention of obedience to God, and supposall that their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are his Revelations, and use those meanes which they in their Conscience think best to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether they be or no, (though it be when they find themselves unable to search, by trusting others whom they count fittest to be trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) I beleeve they are in a very saveable estate, though they be farr from having of the truth of their Tenets any Infallible certaintie; and the same I think of those which are in error, for since you cannot deny, but that a Child, or a Clown, with the same aptnesse to follow Gods will, may be taught by his Parents, or his Preacher, that what God forbids, he commands, that Christ's Vicar, is Antichrist, or the Church, <hi>Babylon,</hi> and scarce teacheth any truth, though it could not teach the least error; why should such a one be damned for the misfortune of having had Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Parents, or a deceiving Preacher: For no more it seemes is required of such, then to give his beliefe to those; (And indeed the same reason extended, will excuse him, who though learned,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:54903:132"/>
impartially aimeth at Gods will and misseth it) for though you seeme to insinuate, by the cause you give of what you say, that so men believe and do what they heare God command, he careth not upon what grounds, yet I, who know that God hath no other gaine by our so doing, then that in it we sacrifice to him our soules and affections, cannot believe, but that they shall be accepted who give him that which he most cares for, and obey him formally, though they disobey him materially, God more considering and valuing the Heart then the Head, the end then the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the fountaine then the streames; And truely else he who through stupidity or impotence abstained from any vice, or through negligence or prejudice miss'd some error, would be as well accepted of by God, as he that by a care of his waies and of obedience to him who should rule them, did avoide the first, and by a studious search, the second.</p>
               <p>I cannot part from this Theame without one consideration more, and that is, that if so Fallible a Director as you speak of, may be cause enough of assent to one Truth, why may they not be so to another, and why shall not the beleefe of our ignorants, upon their testimonie, that the Scripture is the Word of God, be as well found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as that of yours to the Infallibility of the Church upon the same? And yet it is daily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to us, that this beleefe of ours is not surely enough founded, since not received from their Church, although the unlearned among us receive
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:54903:133"/>
it from their Parents and Preachers, and the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from Tradition; as from the first of those your unlearned do, and from the second of which your learned pretend they do receive the authority, and infallibility of the Church it self: Although we be so much more reasonable then you, that we require them not to be so sure upon it, as they are of what they know by sence, but onely to give them so much credit, that they may give up their hearts to obedience.</p>
               <p>Neither do I remit him to a generall and constant <note place="margin">Resp.</note> Tradition, as if himself should climbe up every age by learned Writers, and find it in every one I take it to be impossible testimonies one may find in many ages, but such as will demonstrate and convince a full Tradition I much doubt: Neither do I find by experience, that who will draw a man by a rope or chaine, giveth him the whole rope or chaine into his hands, but onely one end of it, unto which if he cleave hard, he shall be drawn which way the rope is carried. Tradition is a long chaine, every generation or delivery from Father to Son being a link in it, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Of this opinion I was wholly before, First up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Repl.</note> my own small observation, (which also per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded me, that no controverted opinions had so much colour for such a Tradition out of antiquity, as some which now are by both parts condemned. And after, by consideration of what hath been so temperately learned, and judiciously writen by our Protestant, <hi>Perron D'Aille;</hi> But though I think that nothing is wholly provable by suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient testimonies of the first ages, to have had
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:54903:133"/>
Primary and generall Tradition, (except the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted books of Scripture, or what is so plainly there, that it is not controverted between you and us) yet I think the Negative is easie to be proved, because any one known person dessenting, and yet then accounted a learned and pious Catholique, shews the Tradition not to have been generall, and that the Church of this Age differs from that of those times, if it Anathematize now, for what then was either approved of, or at least thought not so horrid but it might be borne with. And again, though we agree upon what will not serve to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince a full Tradition, yet we disagree about what will serve; for allowing there were any contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted opinions delivered, with equall Tradition to the Scripture (which I deny to have beene, but would receive if it so appeared) yet sure you beginne at the wrong end, in the examination of what those are, which ought to be done, by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the testimonies of the first ages, and not of the last, for in your own similitude of a rope, though to helpe me to climbe by if, you put but one end into my hands, yet you must shew me, that the other end is somewhere fastened, or else, for ought I know, instead of getting up by it, I may onelie get a fall, and this fastening appeares not to me, till I be shewed some more certaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between the Opinions of this Age, and those of the Apostolicke times, then yet you have done, or till you have answered those Arguments, by which, as I perswade my selfe, I have made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that it cannot be done,</p>

As for the two places concerning the Popes and <note place="margin">Resp.</note> Councels Infallibillity, it is not to my purpose to meddle of them, because of one side the way I have begun, beareth no need of those discourses, and on the other, I should engage my selfe in Quarrels betweene Catholique and Catholique, obscure the matter I have taken in hand, and profit nothing in my hearers, more then to be judged, peradventure to have more learning, then wisedome to governe it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
               <p>With your favour Sir, these places concerne, <note place="margin">Repl.</note> not onely questions between your selves, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and us; for I thought you had all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed (though I knew you had not alwaies done so, and though it seemes by your declining to speak about it, that you doe not yet) that generall Councels, confirmed by the Pope, are infallible, and the Doctrines defined by them, are to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved <hi>de fide,</hi> which if you be not, then the Glew, which it is so bragged, you have to keepe you still at Unitie, is dissolved and if you be, then you should both have answered upon what grounds you are so, and have destroyed my Objections against the possibilitie of certaintie, knowing when it is, that these (which used to be called the Church) have defined: finding therefore <hi>Altum Silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> where there was so much cause of speaking, makes me beleeve, that the cause why you have not answered is, onely because you could not, and then you have a readie Apologie, that <hi>Nemo tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ad impossibilia,</hi> which I beleeve the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I know, that to so cleare a judgement as yours
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:54903:135"/>
that place of Scripture, <hi>When two or three are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together,</hi> &amp;c. which is so often press'd for the Infallibilitie of Councels, must appeare to make as much for the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> as for the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> and to so great a learning as yours, it cannot be unknown how few (if any) of the Ancients have asserted their Infallibilitie, and how many, both of the Ancients, and your Modernes, have denied it; I am confirmed in this beleife too, because you, I know, would never have accepted that as a sufficient excuse from me, if I had avoided to answer an Argument so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Protestants are not agreed upon the point, if you had thought it such, as that they ought to have been agreed upon it, and truelie this is as great and considerable a question, as any among us.</p>
               <p>As for the two places of <hi>Fevardentius,</hi> which <note place="margin">Resp.</note> alloweth many Fathers to have fallen into errors, I thinke it will not trouble him who is accquainted with the course of this present Church, wherein di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, who be thought great Divines, fall into errors, for which their Bookes are sometimes hindered from the print, sometimes recalled, or some leaves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be pasted up, the reason is, the multiplicity of Catholike Doctrine which doth not oblige a man to the knowledge of every part, but to the prompt sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the instruction of the Church, wherefore many men may hold false doctrine inculpably, not knowing it to be such, even now after the learned labours of so many that have strived to open and facilitate by Method, what is true, and what is false,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:54903:136"/>
much more in the Fathers times, when there was great want of so many Compilers as these latter ages have produced.</p>
               <p>First, What <hi>Fevardentius</hi> confesseth, proves <note place="margin">Repl.</note> plainlie that, for which I intended it, which was, the ridiculousnesse of proving their Doctrine to be true, by being conformable to that of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and yet making themselves Judges of those Judges they appeale too, and confessing, that many of them erred in many points, which if they did, they might as well doe the same in those about which we differ, although they agreed with you, and dissented from us.</p>
               <p>Secondlie, What both he confesseth, and you confesse with him, disproves that way of knowing divine Truths which you propose, for neither the Doctors of the ancient Church (who were sure more likelie to know what was then taken for Tradition, then any late Compilers) nor of the Modern, who had a mind to deliver truth, and trac'd and followed your way of finding it, could erre in points of faith, if <hi>Qui docet ut didicit,</hi> he that teacheth as he hath been taught, must still be in the right, for publique Tradition, no learned man, at least can be ignorant, not any man (say you) of what he was taught when a Childe, as the substance of his hopes for all eternitie, and so cannot in reason have his books either forbidden or pasted up, for delivering any thing contrary to it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Who are these Censors who forbid and paste up books, certainly not the Universall
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:54903:136"/>
Church, nor yet the Representative, the latter is not alwaies in being, nor when it is, at leasure to consider and judge all authors, and of the first these Authors are a part, if then they be fallible, (as they must be if they be not the Church) why may not they erre, and the Martyr-books speake truth, which yet will easily by this meanes be kept from Posteritie, if those in the Dictatory Office dissent from it as they will be sure to do, if the opinion contradict never so little the power or greatnesse of the Pope, upon whose favour these Oecumenicall Correctors must depend, or they not longremaine in their places: and yet you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that your adversary should produce successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their opinions in all ages, though nothing be let passe but what a few please, and though when in time all of you are agreed (as you will soon be or appear to be, if one side appear to be gag'd) then this consent, though thus brought about, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the consent of the Church, and a very notable Motive.</p>
               <p>And since you say, that what all are bound to, is onely a prompt subjection to the Church, why leave you it so in doubt, what is the Church, as if men were tyed to be subject, but must not know to what; you say indeed, that the adherers to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are now the Church, but what they may be, you will not plainely declare; So that if a Schisme among them should happen, we are all as farr to seek as if you had been wholly si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, for since the infallibility lies not in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and consequently the adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:54903:137"/>
to her is not ever a sufficient note of the Church, (as you will not say) nor is it among your selves <hi>de fide,</hi> since the Universall Church (whatsoever she be) can never define any thing, and of the authority of the definitions of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative, and of what constitutes both her and her decrees, you refuse to speak, what remaines there, to which this prompt subjection is to be the onely everlasting Note of the true Church, but onely the Truth whensoever she appeares; Thus as the Priests of <hi>Apollo</hi> (therefore peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture called <hi>Loxias</hi>) used to spread lies, and secure his reputation, the first by the antiquity, and the second by the darknesse of his Oracles, so doth your Religion gaine upon many men, and secure her seflf rom many objections, by the manyfold acceptions, and consequently difficulty of this tearme Church; For whatsoever is said in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture concerning her being free from all spot, or prevailing against the gates of Hell, or their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger who resist her, the first meant (as I believe, and the place denies not by any circumstance) of the Church Triumphant, the second of the Church of the Elect, and the third, of the Professors of Christianity in generall, or at most of those who are in all necessary points Orthodox among them; That they without sufficient proofe resolve to be spoken of the Church in their sence they have fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied; That is, some ever known body of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans which must be still guide to the rest, and then claime to be that, because no other (all else being more ingenious) claimes it besides themselves,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:54903:137"/>
whereas, if (considering that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and the Oraculous truth of my great Lord <hi>Bacon's</hi> observation, that unlesse men in the beginning of their disputes agree about the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their tearmes, they must end about words, where they ought to have begun) they had mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what other sence these words were capable of, (for if it will here beare another, then this cannot hence be concluded but by leave) they would then soon have seen the weaknesse of their building, by the slightnesse of their foundation. Againe, they prevaile much by working upon mens assents, by the meanes of their modesties, and presse it to be an intollerable pride to oppose their opinions to the consent of the Catholick Church; whereas, if it be weighed how small a part of it they mean by that word, and yet of them how many follow blindly the decrees of one, and how soon those prevaile against that few not backed by any power who do not, it will then appeare, that not onely other Churches, but even a <hi>John</hi> or a <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> have as much reason to be lead by their own understandings, as by the opinions and decrees of and <hi>Vrban</hi> or a <hi>Gregory,</hi> upon which that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent is so often founded; And as they make their advantage of this word in their offensive warres, so do they in their defensive, for when they are press'd unto the absurdity of their Tenets, then (though indeed they be generall) yet they pretend, that they are the opinions but of private, though many men, and not of the Church; and againe, when any Fathers (who yet sometimes they say
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:54903:138"/>
are wholly theirs) are shewed to contradict some of their Doctrines so plainely, that none of those subterfuges, which in one of their expurgatory Indexes, they consesse they often use, will serve to palliate it; then they strive to scape by answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that the Church had not then defined it, whereas if it be examined, how farre they consent about what is the Church, and what are her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions (whereof they are not yet agreed, for some say, she hath defined what, others say, she hath not) this onely will be certainlie found, that it never can be certainlie found, what are her opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of any point, or when she hath declared her selfe: As (besides manie other Arguments, some press'd by my selfe, and others, by other Pens more fit to treat of so weightie a matter) appeares by your refusing to leave your <hi>Latibula;</hi> and declare plainlie your opinion concerning it, which if you saw defensible, and you were all agreed about it, you would quicklie have done, and not incurred the reprehension of that Axiome, which teacheth, that <hi>Dolosus versatur in generalibus,</hi> which makes me thinke, that if this were generallie enough mark'd, you would no longer be able to dazle any mans eyes with the splendid title of Somes to the Catholique Church, as <hi>Alexander</hi> hoped to doe those of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> with stiling himselfe <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:54903:138"/>
To conclude this Paragraph, give me leave to aske one question, and that is, how your saying, that Truth is more easie to finde now then in the Fathers times, will agree, either with the way which you say, is the onely Catholique one to finde Truth by (for sure such a Tradition was alwaies equallie easie to finde, and if the first ages had erred in it, we must of necessitie, following your advice, have followed their error too) or with the saying of so many of your side, that if I should reckon them up, I should make a Catalogue of Authors, equall to those of <hi>Photius,</hi> or <hi>Gesner,</hi> or <hi>Possevine,</hi> who all joyne, that Truth was most likelie to be most certainlie known that time, which was, in <hi>Campians</hi> words, <hi>Christo propior, ab hac lite remotior,</hi> neerer to Christ, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentlie to Tradition, and to which, for that cause, all thinke fit to appeale against us, or with that custome of your Church, which suffers none to take Orders before they have vowed to interpret Scriptures according to the Fathers, which if men now adaies be more likelie to find the Truth, then at that time they were (as they must be, if truth in this age be more easie to be found, whether through greater abundance of Compilers, or what else soever) then this Vow is as much, as if they had vowed to leave the best way of Interpretation and teaching, to follow the worst.</p>
               <p>As for the two points, he saith, avert him <note place="margin">Resp.</note> from Catholique doctrine, I am mistaken, if he be not mistaken in both. The first is, that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques doe damne all who are not in the Union of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:54903:139"/>
their Church. He thinkes the sentence hard, yet I thinke he will not deny me this, that if any Church does not say so, it cannot be the true Church. For call the Church what you will; the Congregation of the Elect, the Congregation of the Faithfull, the Congregation of Saints, or Just; call it, I say, or define it what you will, doth it not clearly follow, that whosoever is out of the Church cannot be saved, for he shall not be the Elect, Just, Faithfull, &amp;c. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which there is no salvation. How then can any Church maintain these two Propositious, I am the true Church, and yet one may be saved without being in me:</p>
               <p>This is, by your favour, a meere Paralogisme; <note place="margin">Repl.</note> for though those who define the Church by qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, which both Parts agree, to be the conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Keyes to the Kingdome of Heaven, must needs affirme, that none out of the Church can be saved, yet what is this to them, who meane by the Church, the Companie of the Orthodox in all points, and by them your selves, out of which (allowing that there be such a one, which I doubt of, and that to be yours) I shall beleeve, that some may be saved, till I see some more cause to thinke all error in Religion alwaies damnable, which it is plaine, by what after you say, that you thinke not your selfe, and the Church taken in this sence, which is your sence, may maintaine both Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions; or to shew you, how much, what you say, would make against your selfe, thus I argue; The true Church must hold that none can be saved out of her, but your Church denies not, but that some
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:54903:139"/>
out of her may be saved, therefore yours is not the Church: My <hi>Major</hi> is included in your own saying, that those two Propositions are not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable together: My <hi>Minor,</hi> though false, yet is also your confession (where you say, that the Churches Proposition is not so cruell as it seemes, though the words be rough) and therefore so ought you to make my conclusion too: Besides, those who exclude all from Salvation, who are out of the Church in the other sence, meaning by it the Elect, as they are not like them in the wrong, so they are not occasion of much harme, like them, who stiling the Church, a companie of men of such a beleife, and under such a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, affirme an impossibilitie of being saved out of it; for they giving no visible signe of who is in the Church (for who can know the Elect, but the Electer) cause no want of Charitie, nor fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencie of Warre, and persecutions by it, as the others doe, who having made first a visible par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, least those who are out of it may draw others out too, they send them out of the world by way of prevention.</p>
               <p>But per adventure he is scandalized, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick <note place="margin">Resp.</note> Church requireth actuall Communion exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall with her, which he thinketh may in some case be wanting without detriment of Salvation. But how would he have the Church speake, which speak eth in common, but abstracting from such particular eases as may change wholly the Nature of the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>I am scandalized, not because you require to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation <note place="margin">Repl.</note>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:54903:140"/>
joining with you in Communion, but because also you require joyning with you in opinions, and if it were onely this, yet am not I any whit satisfied with what you say for it, for with the true Church, that is the Commpany of true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, in points any way materiall (or rather the truest) I conceive it not damnation sometimes not to communicate: For if they have any never so slight errors, and which appeares so to me, which yet they will force me to subscribe to, if I Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with them, my assent would be damnable, or if they require the same subscription to some truths, which yet after my reall indeavours in inquiry, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear errors to me, I doubt not but my refusall is no way damnable: Neither can I absolve your Church concerning this her saying for your reason, because she speakes in generall, wholly abstracting from particulars, which change the nature of the Question, for why doth she so, why doth she not expresse her exceptions, or at least tell us, that the rule is not so generall, but that it will beare some, and not make men (who know not that she intends to restraine at all, what she so absolutely pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, and who will find no cause to take your bare word for her intentions) many times, at least to hate them as Gods enemies, whom he loves as his friends, and beleeve them to fry in Hell, who shine in Heaven? Howsoever if she use to expresse herself in rougher words then her meaning is, how apt may she be to be mistaken in severall of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions, and consequently how easie is it for some age to have misunderstood the past, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:54903:140"/>
the following: Neither do I like your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, because that is not to differ from the Church, but to mistake her meaning, though even he, who should denie that there were three Gods, if he thought that by the Trinitie your Church so meant, must consequently think her not infallible, and so by your grounds be conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a Heretick.</p>
               <p>The current of Catholick Doctors, that no man shall be <note place="margin">Resp.</note> damned for infidelity, but he who doth wilfully misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, and that to do so it is required that Faith be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently proposed unto him, and what is to be sufficiently proposed, is not determined amongst them. There want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not Divines who teach, that even <hi>ignorantia affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ata,</hi> doth excuse from Heresie. On the other side it is most certaine, that no man is damned for not profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, what he is not damned for not believing. Wherefore, profession being that which engrafteth a man exteriorly in the Church, according unto the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary opinions of the Catholicks, it followeth, that no man is condemned for not being of the Church, who is not for infidelity, for which it is a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine Case who be damned, and who be not.</p>
               <p>As the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> after long calling the <note place="margin">Repl.</note> 
                  <hi>Hollanders</hi> Rebels, at last for his own sake descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to treat with them as free States, so those of your Religion, when they hope to gaine a Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, thunder out to him crudelity, and without any of these Mollifications which you now use, that <hi>extra Ecclesiam Romanam nulla est salus,</hi> there is no salvation out of the Roman Church. And Master <hi>Knot</hi> peremptorily avers, that no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick

of an entire fame ever taught, that a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant so dying could be saved, yet when they are press'd with the consequences, they can (as it seems) vouchsafe to give us better words, and find <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> enough to soften this opinion, though such as bring them more disadvantage in other considerations, then help in this. For first, as before it seemed that you are not fully agreed either about the authority of the councels, or what constitutes the Church, (by your avoiding to speak concerning it) so now it seemes, that neither are you resolved of what constitutes an Heretick, and then what remaines there for you to know, if what you account in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible and what damnable, be yet both uncertaine to you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Since you confesse none to be a Heretique, but he to whom the truth is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proposed, and when that is, you are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved: what a more then <hi>Sythian</hi> Barbarousnesse is it to make a coale of a Christian, onely upon suspicion of Heresie? especially since the <hi>Pagans</hi> themselves had Christian Charity enough to perswade them, that it was much better that a guilty person should escape, then an innocent be punished: much more should you rather suffer the tares to grow, then venture to pluck up the corne with it, and beleeve the best, when the truth lies hid in a place so hard to search into, as is the heart of man, into which (as none entered the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> but the High Priest) God onelie can have admittance.</p>
               <p>The other point was of putting Hereticks to death, <note place="margin">Resp.</note>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:54903:141"/>
which I think he understandeth to be done vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, not medicinally, I mean, imposed as a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and not in way to prevent mischiefe, and oppresse it in the head.</p>
               <p>I suppose it small satisfaction to a poor man, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <note place="margin">Repl.</note> to the stake for his Conscience, to know by which member of a distinction he is put to death, and that this as little excuseth you, as it satisfies them, I hope to shew before we have ended the consideration of this present Paragraph.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Circumcelians</hi> were the first, that is, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <note place="margin">Resp.</note> enough for the justification of the fact; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though for Banishment, which also he seemeth to reprehend, we know the first that could suffer it did suffer it, <hi>Arrius</hi> I mean, by the hand of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> whom he praiseth for a speech he uttered before he knew the consequence of the danger, and seemeth to reprehend for his after and better witts.</p>
               <p>I wish to you what <hi>Erasmus</hi> wisht to <hi>Augustinus</hi>

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:54903:143"/>
and to whom it is fit to be left. Howsoever the long doubt of some, and opposall of other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox to this course, and that arising not from their Policie or Compassion, but their Conscience, not as thinking it unprofitable or unfit, but unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, shews, that there was then no Tradition that the Apostles taught it to be lawfull so to use Hereticks, upon which onelie, all the Infallibilitie, which you claime for any beliefe or custome of your Church, is founded,</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Austine</hi> justifieth such proceedings against <note place="margin">Resp.</note> Hereticks.</p>
               <p>Truely for putting them to death (unlesse when <note place="margin">Repl.</note> they first assaulted) which makes a wide difference, for then it was not done as to Hereticks, but as to <hi>Assassines,</hi> from whom Nature teaches us to defend our selves, and consequentlie to re-offend them whensoever Religion barres it not, experience shewing us the danger of meerly defending, to be neer to that too, of not doing it at all) I know not that ever he did, nor do I beleeve it: That some degree of punishment should be inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, I confesse he at last consented, but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to force them to come and see what the Church did, (whose actions the Hereticks impudently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied; as if they set pictures upon the altar, and did what you both doe and defend, and they did not) <hi>i. e.</hi> denied it. Howsoever we have Saint <hi>Austine</hi> against Saint <hi>Austine,</hi> and not onely his authority, but his reasons more valid by much, then that when he saith, that such oppressions would make them think themselves <hi>vi victos,</hi>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:54903:143"/>
                  <hi>non veritate convictos,</hi> overcome by force, not convicted by Truth, and consequently dislikes it, <hi>ne fictos Catholicos habeamus, quos apertos Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos novimus,</hi> least they become from open Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, but fained Catholicks: Reasons, which (though these be not all we have) in my opinion it was as impossible for him reasonably to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer when he was living, as it would be now for him to do it when he was dead. Besides, as he useth these strong arguments against it, so he is himself a strong example against it, for the Church had lost this her so notable Champion, if they then had been as severe to the <hi>Manichees</hi> as you are to us.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> vseth the like against <hi>Pagans,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Resp.</note> (if I remember) and the Church laterly hath rather encreased, then decreased in the practice of it.</p>
               <p>I believe your memory deceives you in this, <note place="margin">Repl.</note> which you have cause to hope it doth, for else the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> differs from that of Saint <hi>Gregories</hi> times, it being now with her a judged case, that Infidels may not be compelled to the Faith, as I am told is shewed by <hi>Vaelentia,</hi> Saint <hi>Thomas, Hartado,</hi> and others, the Church having no power over those who are out of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they please to say, that (like them who among the <hi>Romans</hi> were onely <hi>Cives ad onera,</hi> liable to the taxes of Citizens, without Interest in their Priviledges) Baptisme hath made us of the Church enough to be liable to her Punishments, though not to be benefitted by her Communion: Though indeed the same cause why you would
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:54903:144"/>
have Hereticks put to death, for feare of harming others with their opinions, me thinks should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to their punishment too, unlesse you believe us to be as bad as Malefactors, and not them, or that their opinions are so irrationall as not likely to spread, and ours so reasonable, that against them the sword is the best shield, and therefore (as <hi>Brennus</hi> did his) you put that into the scales for want of weight, it being of giving Reasons as the Poet saith it is of giving Requitalls, <hi>Irasci quam donari vilius constat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another reason which perswades me that you are mistaken in what you say of <hi>Gregory,</hi> (as this mistake facilitates my beliefe, that you are so about <hi>Austines</hi> too) is that <hi>Bede</hi> tells, that some <hi>Romanists,</hi> having converted the King of <hi>Kent,</hi> that King did not yet force any to become Christians, for (saith he) he had learned of these his Masters, that the service of Christ (WHICH REASON EXTENDS FARTHER THEN TO PA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GANS) must be voluntary, and not forced; Now if these received what they taught from <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi> (as you often tell us) then either he did not as you often say, or thought that unlawfull which himself did; And howsoever this Custome hath encreased since is very unconsiderable, for unlesse it have its authority explicitely or implicitely from the Apostles, it can give none since, and unlesse it be proved to be well done at first, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance can give this, or any other action more justification then at first it had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moses</hi> speech I believe is mistaken, the force of <note place="margin">Resp.</note>

it being, that the banishment of Bishops shewed his faith, because the banished were Catholickes, which shewed <hi>Lucius</hi> to be none.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Moses</hi> had meant as you would have him, <note place="margin">Repl.</note> he should not have said, onely <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> not indefinitelie the banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Bishops, but the banishing of Orthodox Bishops, the leaving therefore of that out, wherein, according to you, the whole sence of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lay, seemes to me plainlie enough to shew, that he meant what they and you denie: especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie he adding (as you may see in <hi>Zozomon</hi>) their being punish'd by labour, as well as punishment, and then saying, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> which things are whollie abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from Christ, and all right Beleevers concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God, and in <hi>Socrates,</hi>

               <p>But what can be said, if the Church useth that for <note place="margin">Resp.</note> the prevention of a greater and more dangerous evill, which all politique Estates use for the remedies of lesse, and lesse dangerous evils, and are commended for it. For if Faith he the way to Salvation, and Heresie be the bane of Faith; if Salvation the greatest good, then the danger of a Countries being over-runne with Heresie, is the greatest of dangers, greater then the multiplicity of Theeves, greater then the unsurety of the wayes, greater then a Plague, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion; why then doth not reason force us to use meanes to prevent it, which the same reason-and experience teacheth us to be most efficacious in this, and all
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:54903:145"/>
other contagious and gangrening maladies of the Common-wealth. I hope reason it selfe, and the Zeale of the Author to his own, and Countries sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, will supply my shortnesse in this point, for supposing a Church be assured she is in the right, and that the doctrine preach'd, as then leadeth to damnation; I know not why <hi>Caiphas</hi> his words should not be propheticall in this case, and that truly it doth <hi>expedire,</hi> that <hi>Unus moriatur pro populo, &amp; non tota gens pereat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I wish heartilie, you were as good a Caterer as <note place="margin">Repl.</note> a Cooke, I meane, that you brought as good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as you dresse artificiallie what you bring; For I finde there is in your words a verie nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> able to steale a man into your opinion, before he hath askt himselfe why; but if he stay to doe so, then all your excellent embroiderie will not keepe him from discerning manie bracks in your stuffe: To prove which, I will bring many reasons (besides what I have taught alreadie) by which it shall, I hope, appeare, why those, whom you call Hereticks, should not be put to death, although Malefactors may, although even the lawfulnesse of that (since other punishments, which would not shorten their time of repentance, might peradventure serve to represse them) is not absolutelie certaine.</p>
               <p>First, Malefactors plainlie offend against their Consciences, at least, thinke not themselves bound by them to commit their villanies (neither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend they otherwise) which they, whom you call Hereticks, either <hi>bona fide</hi> follow, or doe for ought at least you can know.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:54903:145"/>
Secondlie, What are Malefices, must be known before Malefactors, and Heresies before Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; now of the first Mankinde agrees, but of the second but you onely, a small part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and yet you differ too about the waies of knowing-them, and consequentlie, whether some things be Heresies or no (as for example, whether the Oath of Alleagiance containe any) wherein since some of you are deceived, me thinkes it should incline you to thinke it not impossible for you all to doe so, in what you all agree to be such.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie, Malefactors are not, or should not be punished for such, without a plaine knowledge that such they are; but although there were an impossibilitie of mistaking what is Heresie, yet there is no possibilitie of knowing who are Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, the forme of which is obstinacie, a secret, and (to man) an undiscoverable qualitie, whom he onelie should punish who onelie knowes.</p>
               <p>Fourthlie, Malefactors are certaine to hurt others, whereas neither are Heretickes sure to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade any, and if they doe, yet they may hurt none, since who receives their beleife <hi>bona fide,</hi> and through meer error, is unharmed by it.</p>
               <p>Fifthlie, Whom they doe harme, it must be through their own fault, and by their own consent, whereas without either, the Malefactors are cause of much mischiefe, even to the most guiltlesse.</p>
               <p>Sixthlie, Malefactors passing whollie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punish'd, peradventure not put to death, would bring a certaine destruction to the state, which
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:54903:146"/>
temporall Magistrates are appointed to watch over, which yet in speculative opinions is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, The punishment even by death, of Malefactors brings not any temptation of sinning, upon them, the same to others is in all probabilitie a cause to keep many from a carefull search of Gods Truth, (least they might find the punishable beleefe to be the true one) and from professing it, when they think they have found it; both which are sinns of the first magnitude.</p>
               <p>Eigthly, This course with Malefactors was not, for ought appears, ever thought unlawfull in the purest times of Christianity, and was then in use, whereas towards errors in beleefe, it was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed of them by the chiefe, and long before death was at all inflicted upon them, though then understood as well the danger of Heresie, and were as carefull to preserve their flocks from all danger by all lawfull waies, as any since.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, It no way redounds to Christs Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that Malefactors be unpunisht, but it makes much for it that his Army appears to consist of Volunteers, and not of Press'd men, that his Truth should prevaile by no humane force, but onely by the power of the first teacher, and the light of the Doctrine, which for us unbidden so to assist, is to think the Arke must fall, if we hold not forth our hands to hold it up, and takes from it the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of subsisting by the way, by which it took roote, when (to borrow Saint <hi>Chysostomes</hi> words) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

The weak were to hard for the strong, and twelve for the World, and that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> They being naked, and their adversaries armed.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, That death is the most effectuall way to suppresse Malefactors, you say reason and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience shewes, and it is generally agreed of; but in this case it seems even to your best men the worst course, as appears by <hi>Iburranes</hi> resolution concerning the <hi>Hyper-Ephanians,</hi> by the 267 Page of grave and judicious Cardinall <hi>D' Ossat</hi> his Letters, by the Epistle of Cardinall <hi>Richelieu</hi> to his King before a Book of Controversie, and by <hi>Erasmus</hi> his Testimonie, who tells us, that a <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite</hi> having then this power in his hands, <hi>Ubicunque saevitiam exercuit</hi> Carmelita, <hi>ibi diceres fuisse fact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Haerese<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> sementum,</hi> wheresoever he exercised his crueltie, he seemed to have sowed Heresie. All which reasons make me beleeve, that there is much difference between the striving to destroy these two sorts of men, and if there were not, yet for fore-touched reasons, and others which I will touch at, I should as soone think it unlawfull to put Malefactors to death, as lawfully to kill Hereticks. For indeed since <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> it disadvantageth what you would aide; to seem to beleeve that truth, without other assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, would not sooner roote out falshood, then that it, that the Orthodox are not more likely to cure the seduced, then to be infected by them; and that there is no way to end the Heresies, but by ending the Hereticks: And thus you runne into three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:54903:147"/>
First, You put reasonable scruples into consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering mens minds, least as a <hi>Greek</hi> Orator saith against <hi>Ulysses</hi> for striking <hi>Thersites,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> It was a signe he could not confute him, that he struck him; so that it be want of arguments, which makes you fall to blowes, and cause them to suspect, that if you were not (peradventure for some better reasons then appear to them) diffident of your cause, you would give your adversaries leave to speak as loud as them pleased, and not seek so suspiciously to stop their mouthes, whilst they dispute with you at as much odds, and upon tearmes of as much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did with the <hi>Grecian Jewes,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> he disputed against them, but they went about to stay him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It destroies those plausible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments so often used of Unity, and Tradition, and Multitude, for, first Uniformitie may be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by power, but Unitie and Impunitie can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be parted; all other agreement being but as a theefe and a robbed person agreed, the one to take his purse, and the other to give it againe. Againe Tradition it lames as much, for how can any man tell, but that two parts claiming contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Traditions, or one part claiming it upon false grounds, and the other denying it, the truth may not by this force have been over-born, when we receive not what men would have delivered Posteritie, but what Power would suffer them.</p>
               <p>Againe, how shall we know but that the greater
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:54903:147"/>
part of your multitude beleeves not as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse; no man knowing his Neighbour to be of his mind; when it is so probable, that many may not think as they speak, when it is not lawfull for all to speak as they think.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By this way you are causes, that you suffer often where you have not the State on your side, as much as you inflict when you have; for though you will say that none should punish but the Church, yet every divided companie of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, thinking themselves to be that, (that is to be the orthodox) will use your own custome to your harme, and you will be short like the Eagle in <hi>Esope,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> with your own feathers; and so Truth weresoever she be (if all follow this way) will by force by many parties be opposed, and but by one propagated and defended; so that not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in consideration of Christianity, but even of Policy I mislike this course, as being alwaies wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and often hurtfull, and more often uneffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: And for my part, I desire so much that good be done for evill, that (though you be most fit of any to be so used, who use us so where your power extends, and whose cruelty will extend with your acquisition, if you make any, and you hold your selves, that <hi>impendens periculum</hi> is cause enough for a warr) yet I heartily wish all lawes against you repealed, and trust, that disarmed Truth would serve to expell Falshood, whereas now they being in force against you, give you the honour of a persecution, and not being executed, give you not the feare of one: It is truely said,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:54903:148"/>
                  <hi>Militia Christiana est Haereses expellere,</hi> but it needs this limitation, <hi>sed armis Christianis,</hi> that Christian warfare employ onely Christian armes, which are good arguments, and good life; else if they use such a course, as is more properly <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and go to force that part of man, which is liable to no power but that of perswasion, (which if it do not beget a true and pious assent, in likelyhood it will a damnable dissimulation, and which, if Christ had meant for a prop for his Doctrine, he would as soon have at first made it a part of the foundation, and have charged his Apostles not to shake the dust off their feet, but to draw their swords out of the scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard at those, who rejected what they taught) then it often (though sometimes by reason of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent dispositions which reigne at severall times among men, and may happen otherwise) misseth of the intended end, and works not often so much as upon mens tongues, and never upon their Heads and Hearts: A great example of which happened not long since, <hi>Calvin</hi> with all his works since the time they were written, having scarce made so many Protestants in <hi>France,</hi> as I have credibly heard it reported, that the Massacre made in a Night, which act though I impute not to all those of your Religion, for many of them I know did, and do mislike it, yet it both had its fountaine from the Popes Legate, (and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in all likelyhood from the Pope, who gave God publick thanks for it) as one of his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors confess'd to Cardinall <hi>D' Ossat,</hi> Page

432, and it may be justified as well as any judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all proceeding, upon that reason which you give, why Heresie may be stopped with the sword, least they who are wrought upon by it, may work upon others.</p>
               <p>To conclude, I should be better contented with this course, if the opinions were infallibly errors, and infallibly damnable, and this were alwaies an effectuall way, (and no other could be found more mercifull) to stop their spreading, but since you have no infallible way of knowing the Church to be infallible in her definitions, and consequently, that the contrary opinions are false, since you know not infallibly which is she, (for you pretend but prudentiall Motives) since your knowledge having defined, is likewise fallible, as depending upon many uncertaine circumstances, since not onely the matter of Heresie is thus uncertaine, but the form too: for you confesse you doubt whether <hi>Ignorantia affectata</hi> be it or no, and since though the form were certaine, yet in whom, it is by no meanes plaine, but rather impossible to be known, (as who is obstinate, and consequently to whom it is damnable) since this course often gives growth, and strength to that, from which it would take even Being and Subsistance: I cannot but think you have cause to change your proceedings, least not onely you expell not, but least you encrease Heresie, and againe least you oppose it not, but mistake the Truth for it, and applaud your self for cutting off a Gangren'd member, when you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy a sound one, and instead of ending a Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:54903:149"/>
make a Martyr, and againe least (allowing this to be the Truth) yet you put to death inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent persons instead of guilty; especially since if the opinions were damnable in whomsoever they were, yet some better way might be found, (as close imprisonment or the like) to keep them from harming with them, rather then (as you do by putting them to death, when else they might live to be converted) to damne them certainly, least they may possibly damne some others; Againe for Protestants, who joyne with me in beleeving that there is no way to know the true Church, but by true Doctrine, nor to know that but by the Scripture, (for Universall Tradition seemes to us to deliver nothing but what is so plainly contained there, that it is agreed upon) in them I beleeve it must be intollerable Pride, and rashnesse, (and the same in Papists concerning those places out of which they would prove the Churches infallibility) To conclude, this seemes to me the sence of this place of Scripture, therefore this infallibility it is, and no man can denie it, who either gainsaies not his Conscience, or hath it not mislead by some sinfull passion or affection, and therefore the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers must be damned, and therefore least they damne others, we will send them through one fire to another. And this, though it be an equall fault in both Protestants and Papists to say and do, yet it is more Illogicall in the former, as contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at first sight all their Principles, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying the whole Platforme upon which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was built.</p>

He urgeth afterwards against the Unity of the <note place="margin">Resp.</note> Church, that it is none such as we brag of, And I confesse we brag of it, and think we have Reason. And if it please him to look into the difference of our Country of <hi>England,</hi> and some land of <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> as <hi>Brasile,</hi> or such other, where they live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Law or Government, I think he will find our bragging is not without ground. For wherein is the difference betwixt a Civill Government and a Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Anarchie? Is it either that in a Civill Estate there be no Quarrells, or amongst <hi>Barbarians</hi> there is no Quiet? The former would prejudice our Courts and Justice; the latter is impossible even in Nature. What is then the goodnesse of a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but in a well Governed Country there is a means to end Quarels, and in Anarchie there can be no assured peace? This therefore is it we brag of, that amongst us if any controversie arise, there is a way to end it, which is not amongst them who parted from us. And Secondly, That there is no assured agreement amongst those who parted from us, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though to day they agree, there is no bond or tie why to morrow they may not disagree. These two things we brag of, and I think the Author will not denie it. For he confesseth that we all agree, in that the Church is an infallible Mistresse. Then it is evident, that if in any controversie she interposeth her judegment, the controversie is ended. He likewise confesseth, that who part from us have no such definitive authority amongst them, and that Scripture, whereon they rely, hath no such vertue to take up Controversies clearely.</p>

Supposing that we agreed much lesse then you, yet a little, all in earnest, that is unforced, is more considerable, then much constrained, and so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure much of that much but in appearance; Besides, that you all agree in those points, wherein if any disagree, he becomes none of you, is no more then is so common to all Religions, that even the very Anabaptists may say as much for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; For either all the Parts of them remaine of assent, insomuch that they are all still of the same Religion, and so agree as well as your, <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans</hi> and Jesuites, or else their differences are such, as to make them of severall Religions, and then, why is want of Unity objected to them any more then it is to Christians in generall, among whom are so many divisions, and yet not the whole, but the faulty party taxed? And truely in my opinion some Questions among your selves are as great, not onely as any among your adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, but as any between you and them. I but you answer, we have a way of being agreed, we reply, is it a way sure to lead to Truth as well as to Unity, or else so might we have by going to most at three throwes, and resolving to stand to that. Besides, if you have, and make no more use of it, it seemes there is no such need that Questions be ended, as for that purpose to introduce a necessitie of an Ender. But say you, neither are all suits in the Common-wealth ended; We reply, that yet truely those Judges, who should make no more haste to end them, then your Judge doth these, would deserve to loose his place, but this they
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:54903:150"/>
do as fast as the nature of the thing will permit; which being or depending upon matter of Fact, cannot be known erough to be judged before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of witnesses, and the like, be ended, and if they willingly deferre the ending, they are confess'd to be in fault by all men, but those who hold Perjury to be none. But you seem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our grounds faulty, as not leading even to a possible Unity, whereas to a possible one I am sure they do, (since what is concluded out of them by many, may be by all) nay indeed am confident, that all who receive the Scripture for the onely rule, and believe what is there plain to be onely necessarie, would if they truely beleeved what they professe, and were not lead aside either by prejudice, or private ends, or some Popish re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of holding what they have long been taught, or following the authority of some by them much esteemed, persons either alive or dead) soon agree in as much as is necessarie, and in concluding no necessity of agreeing in more, there being no doubt, but it would soone appear plainly what is plaine.</p>
               <p>Besides if no grounds be sufficient for Unitie, which produce not the effect, then it seemes, the grounds of your grounds, those Arguments, by which you prove, that there is a Judge, and a generall Councell is it, are insufficient, since they are not able to make all Christians about this question: Again, although a Judge, and this Judge be received, yet this is still an insufficient ground for Unitie, since the <hi>Greek</hi> Church agree thus farre with you (which is as farre as you agree with
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:54903:151"/>
one another) and yet are not so bound by it to any universall Unitie with them, but that they esteem you Hereticks, and are esteemed so by you: and if you say, that it is not, because the grounds, upon which the Infallibilitie of the Church are built, lead not sufficientlie to Unitie, that we joyne not with you in beleeving them to be infallible, not because the determination of generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels is not a sufficient meanes of Unitie, that the <hi>Greek</hi> Church admitting their authoritie, admits not of your opinions, but it is the fault of us (and of them) hardening our hearts against the truth; then we may as well say, that some of those, who agree in our grounds, yet disagree from our doctrine, not that the grounds lead not to Unitie, but that our Adversaries will not be lead; or if (as you doe, and some others of you some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) you confesse, that they through an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent error dissent from you, and doe this without any imputation in this respect to your grounds, I hope it will be lawfull for us to allow the same possibilitie, without any disadvantage or prejudice to ours: Besides, say you, though we agree to day, yet we may not to morrow, which to prove, were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> paines whollie lost, we confesse: For though <hi>Tully</hi> make it an expression of his contempt to <hi>Piso,</hi> in an Epistle to <hi>Atticus, Ita nihil est, ut plane quid erit, nesciat,</hi> yet I take it to be a true saying of man in generall, who knowes little of present things, and nothing of future; but this is common to us both, for if we change not our opinions, we shall agree as we doe, and if you
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:54903:151"/>
change yours you shall not, which is possible, for not onelie that opinion of the Infallibilitie of your judges decrees may it self be altered, which holdeth together all the rest, but some of you may holding that ground (like the Greek, either change their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions concerning the authority of such or such a Councell, as beleeving it unduelie called, factiouslie carried, or not generall as is pretended, or not so consenting as is requisite) or differ from the rest, concerning the sence of the decrees: for whereas, you say, you agree that the Church is an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Mistresse, and when she interposeth her judgement, the controversie is ended.</p>
               <p>I answer, that, first, some of you, with whom I have spoken my selfe, hold, that the Churches authoritie in defining, extends no further then to such points, whereof Tradition is of one part (as in many controverted there is, I beleeve, no such) and that this rule she may transgresse, and so erre.</p>
               <p>Secondlie, Neither the <hi>Dominicans</hi> nor their Adversaries, are very readie to remain in suspence to await her decision, but define all readie concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her definitions, <hi>Cum utraque pars tenax con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendat suam non aliam posse definiri sententiam,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part tenaciouslie urging, that the contrarie opinion cannot be defined, which if they did to fright the Pope from defining, least the condemned partie being even before, should after make a Schisme, they obtained their end.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie, What are you the nearer to Unitie for your Infallible Mistresse the Church, when
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:54903:152"/>
you neither agree of any certaine and proper markes to know her by, nor when it is that she in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposeth her judgement; some take it to be the particular Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> others (of which number you are) all which communicate with her, supposing the first to be true, yet not being <hi>de fide,</hi> it will serve but ill by your rules to build our faith upon, and even when she delivers her opinion is not certainlie agreed, whether the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Rome</hi> be to have Votes, or onelie the Clergie, or of them, onelie the Pope with the Cardinals, or the Pope onelie without them, if the Pope, whether onelie in his Chaire, and what circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances are required to his decreeing in <hi>Cathedra,</hi> would beget more questions: If all that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with her (as you say, it is as things now stand.)</p>
               <p>First, I would know whether they be sure to be at all times the Church, to that you refuse to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, and so inclusivelie denie.</p>
               <p>Secondlie, It is not possible, that such a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude should ever give any sentence explicitelie, nor can we ever know, that it hath even tacitelic done so, if they be to decree onelie by represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, then how large a companie represents them with all their power, of whom that companie is to consist, how many of them are to agree to make it a binding sentence, &amp;c. are things yet unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and like to be, and if any goe about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine them, their power being it selfe still a question, could not end these: Therefore, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you say, that we have no definitive sentence
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:54903:152"/>
(besides that truly to have one, and not to know when we have one, is much alike;) I answer, that whensoever the Scripture shall seeme to us to have defined, we are according to our doctrine readie to yeeld, and so the controversie is ended (and sure the Scripture may be said to be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive sentence, as well as the written Councell of <hi>Trent</hi>) and till then, though we differ about interpretations of not plaine places, we have as much Unitie as you, who are not resolved upon the sence of manie decrees of that and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels: and if a desire and diligence to finde the true meaning of them, and an aptnesse to assent when it is found, be thought to secure among you, those who mistake the true sence of these Councels, why should not the same disposition in us towards the Scripture, be thought every whit as sufficient, not onely to keepe us in unitie, but to secure us from danger.</p>
               <p>To conclude, though unitie be a thing much spoken of by you, yet I finde it chieflie onely in your discourse; your differences are many and great, onelie you say, you agree in what is necessarie, and make the measure of things necessarie what you agree in, so the summe is, you agree in what you doe agree (which it is impossible you should not, though you had carried away the bayes from <hi>Bibrias</hi> his Tombe) eager against us, and yet divided among your selves, like the state of an Armie in <hi>Tacitus, Manente Legionum auxilio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumque, ubi adversus Paganos certandum foret, consensu,</hi> and if your Church brag of such an
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:54903:153"/>
Unity, I perceive a small matter will make her brag.</p>
               <p>Againe, I do confesse most <hi>English</hi> -men confesse <note place="margin">Resp.</note> a Trinity, the Incarnation and Passion of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, but if to morrow, any one or more of them light upon some Book of an <hi>Arrian, Trinitarian,</hi> or other Sect, so wittily written that he putteth probable soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the places of Scriptures, shewes slight waies how our well meaning fore-fathers may have slipped into such an Error, what is there to retaine those men from disagreeing with the rest of their Bretheren, and betake themselves to the <hi>Arrians?</hi> And when the heat is past light upon some Rabbi, who shall cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly exaggerate the absurdities, (as he shall tearm them) of the Trinitie, Incarnation; Say our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our did strange things in vertue of some Constellation, and delivering these things so Oratorically, that for a new heat, some of these things shall seem more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable then his <hi>Arrianisine,</hi> what then shall hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this man to become a <hi>Jew,</hi> and at last to prove himself so great a Clerk as to write <hi>de tribus Impost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oribus:</hi> Take away the power of the Church, which every man doth who taketh away the Infallibility, what can retaine any man why he should not yeeld to that discourse which seemeth fairest, seeing nothing is certaine?</p>
               <p>And if you should meet with a book which <note place="margin">Repl.</note> should give probable solutions to the places of Scripture, and reasons which you now think prove the authority of the Church, and bring other (though suppose but slight, yet such as may seem strong) Arguments to prove it not infallible, and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:54903:153"/>
shew waies of the same kind, how your ancest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors may have slipt in that, and by that into other errors, what is there to retaine you with the rest of your Bretheren, and betaking your selfe to us? If you say this is impossible to be done, so think the Protestants, that the <hi>Arrians</hi> can give them no probable answer to their places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and such as will seem so to some, is no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to their grounds, since so may, and do our Answers and Objections to some of you, who thereupon leave you, and yet you count not your grounds disparaged. For my part, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse my self not onely to be an Anti-Trinitarian, but a Turk, whensoever more reason appeares to me for that, then for the Contrary, and so sure would you be too; for the pretended infallibility of your Church could no longer hold you, if you thought you saw reason to beleeve it fallible, as you must do, if all weighed, more reason ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared of her adversaries side, either your proofes of her authority not to be probable, or else your Doctrinestaught by her, more contrary to reason, then her authority (though probably founded, yet not upon demonstrations) is sufficient to caution, and answer for; It is true, so long as you stick to this hold upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, you are sure to receive no error, but which she offers you, (and indeed you need not, for those are enough) but that destroied (which is apter to be destroied then most of the Protestants, as weaklier supported by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) then no error that a Protestant may fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, but so may you too, and the other is but such a
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:54903:154"/>
Priviledge, as I may have by sticking to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Church, as well as you to the <hi>Roman;</hi> And though this following your guide, may be able, as long as she keep her self, to keep you from some Ditches, into which you might otherwise fall, yet it may lead you unto others, and indeed there is no error but by this way you are liable too, yea, even of those which she now condemnes, since though she changed her opinion, which is neither impossible, nor unlawfull, yet you are by your blind obedience to believe that she had not, and to submit your understanding in this Question to some distinction, though without a difference. These things then I dislike in what you say.</p>
               <p>First, Your saying, as though there is nothing to retain a Protestant from being of any error, when it shall appeare more probable to him then Truth, therefore there were nothing to keep him from those errors, whereas you should have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, that the greater probabilities may serve rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably to hold him without a demonstration, and the evidence of the thing, without a guide, and that if those be not ground enough for a man to fix upon, in how ill estate are those of your Church, in the Question concerning the Church, in which they follow no guide, nor have any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, but professe they yeeld to her autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but upon prudentiall motives, which kind of arguments sure may as well, and as fixedly preserve a Protestant in `n Orthodox opinion against a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, as the authoritie of the Church no sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier founded, can you against us: That every man
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:54903:154"/>
should yeeld to that discourse which seemeeth fairest to him, I confesse, it is alwaies, not onelie safe and fit, but also necessarie, even for them who receive the Infallibilitie of the Church, since those who beleeve that, beleeve it, because that appeares fairest to them, and as you object to us, the possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of being perswaded from the truth by some wittie Author, why thinke you not the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor may possiblie too, appeare to you to destroy your prudentiall Motives, and so consequentlie your whole Faith, which is built upon the Church, which is built upon them.</p>
               <p>Secondlie, I diflike your seeming to beleeve, that any grounds, which are not demonstrative, are too slipperie to rest upon, as not onelie being contrarie to reason, but to your selfe, who told me before, that no more was required, then a maine advantage on one side, and that we had reason to be satisfied with Probabilities to guide our Actions in Religion, or since by them we were content to regulate all the other Actions of our life.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie, I dislike in your own parties behalfe your saying, that a <hi>Protestant</hi> is in good likelihood to turne <hi>Arrian</hi> (for if you meane onelie that it is possible, it concernes you as much as them) since this seemes to inferre, that the Scriptures doe make more probablie for them (which if they did, it is not Heresie) and to contradict all those, whom both parts call Fathers, who thinke enough plaine in Scripture, not onely to keepe, but also to convert men from <hi>Arrianisme,</hi> as it appeares,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:54903:155"/>
by their employing so solelie those Armes against them, that they needed the admonition of a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retique, to counsell them to the use of another.</p>
               <p>Fourthlie, I dislike your saying, that after being made an <hi>Arrian,</hi> he is not unlikelie to turne <hi>Jew,</hi> especiallie, that he is likelie to be perswaded by any exaggeration of the Absurdities in the Trinitie, since both <hi>Grotius</hi> and other Authors, seeme to say, that the <hi>Jewes</hi> have their Trinitie too in the same Notion, and howsoever the <hi>Arrian</hi> is so fullie perswaded alreadie, that those are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities (that perswasion being almost the forme of that opinion which constitutes him an <hi>Arrian</hi>) yet the exaggeration of them can never worke upon him; And for the Constellation you speak of, it were so irrationall, and so unprovable a Crotchet, that no Oratorie could ever make it seeme to a reasonable man, to have any inclination to sence (and a foole may be made beleeve any thing, how contrarie soever to his grounds) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he be of those, who are given over to vaine imaginations, because they love darknesse better then the light, and the fault of no particular mens understanding or will, is to lead any man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne his grounds, for they are to be accused, not of whatsoever he concludes who holds (or rather in this case hath held) them, but onelie of what he concludes reasonablie according to them. Besides, for this cause it appeares strange to me, that trusting to Scripture alone, and without, meaning the Church, for my certaine guide, should bring a man into danger of parting with his Christianitie,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:54903:155"/>
since nothing can hold a man longer then he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves it, and as long as our ground, the Scripture, is by him beleeved, no man can possiblie turne either <hi>Atheist,</hi> or <hi>Jew;</hi> and he who leaves to beleeve your ground, the Church, cannot by that be any more with-held from either: Besides that, I thinke it is impossible (I am sure it is irrationall) that any of you should beleeve in Christ, upon the authoritie of Christs Church, since beleeving the latter (which claimes no authoritie but from Christ) praesupposeth the beleife of him, and so Christianitie is not the apter to be overthrown through the absence of that, upon which it is not built: I feare rather, least your doctrine known to be grounded it selfe upon Tradition by such a way, according to which, a Jew would have much advantage of a Christian, may incline a man to Judaisme, and your sides generall slighting all waies of knowing Gods will, but onely by the Church, and then neither proving her power stronglier, nor teaching how to know her plainer, may make men sinke into <hi>Atheisme,</hi> by being perswaded by you, in letting goe other strong holds upon Truth, and receiving such weake ones from you. Not to speake of your loading Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie with such impossibilities as the Pillars of it, which are not absolute Demonstrations (of which it may be scarce any thing is in nature capable but lines and numbers) are able to beare, and using all your Wits and Industries to perswade men, that it is equallie unsafe to refuse any part of your Religion, as to receive none; and so instead of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:54903:156"/>
making these your beleefs admitted for the sake of Christianitie, causing Christianitie to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected because of them.</p>
               <p>But peradventure some may attribute Power to the <note place="margin">Resp.</note> Church without infallibilitie, whom I would have consider but what himself saith. For his Church by the Power it hath must either say I command you to believe, or I command you to professe this, whether you believe me or no. The second, I think no enemy of equivocation will admit, and the former it is as much as if it should say, I know not whether I say true or no, yet you must think I say true.</p>
               <p>We having received a command, that all things <note place="margin">Repl.</note> be done decently, and in order, and this being to be appointed by them, whom either the Law of the Land, (if that consist of faithfull) or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent or custome of Christians hath appointed, for Ecclesiasticall Rulers in this matter, in every place the Church (thus restrained to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church) may have in some cases (though not to your purpose) power without the least Infallibilitie. And for instruction (which you aime at) no Church can give it, yours espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially being too large a body ever to meet or joyn in doing it, and if you restraine the Church to the Cleargie, (whereof yet many teach not, and they too are too many for any man to be sure what they all agree in teaching, and when they differ, how shall I know which to follow, otherwise then by your Rule which I have answered) their duty indeed, but not theirs onely, (though Principally) is to instruct us in the way to Heaven, which they
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:54903:156"/>
doing in the Persons of Embassadors between God and us, and having no absolute Letters of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to bid us to beleeve that God saies, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they say, he saies, (as much as can be wrested out of Scriptures for any present Church, being said of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who yet proved themselves not infallible) our best way is in my mind to examine their Commission, and if they can shew that they treat according to that, to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to them, (as in the same case we must to any of the <hi>Layetie</hi>) or rather to God, of whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands they are but Organs, and if not, to beware of their Leaven. Yet it may be that some man may hold that such an opinion is to be beleeved onelie, because such a Church proposeth it, and yet not believe her Infallible, since he may think her authoritie (by reason of her Learning, Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, Sanctitie, Unitie and Libertie) to be more probable then any contradicting argument, and that men are to assent to what is most probable, and truelie if he could prove to me his <hi>Major,</hi> I am alreadie so much of the opinion of his <hi>Minor,</hi> that I should joyne with him in his Conclusion.</p>
               <p>So that if I understand any thing, where there is <note place="margin">Resp.</note> no Infallibility, there is no Power; where no Power, no Unity; where no Unity, no Entity; where no En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, no Church.</p>
               <p>How you tie Power to Infallibilitie I guesse, <note place="margin">Repl.</note> but cannot how you tie Unitie to Power: For how many things are all men even at Unitie about, though one have no Power over another in them, onelie cemented together by their clear evidence:

And how many more do whole Bodies, and Sects of men agree about without any such power, though they differ in other points, as so do you too; Do not Protestants agree with you about manie, and the chiefest <hi>credenda,</hi> and about al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all the meerely <hi>facienda?</hi> Though not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to this agreement by the Power of any Judge which they do acknowledge; Nay if men could be at Unitie about no thing, which were not proposed by some Guide, or defined by some Judge endued with such a power, how came all you to agree, that there is some such Guide and Judge required, since sure you receive not that upon its own authoritie, and if men may find the necessitie of a Guide and Judge, without any Guide or Judge, and remain in Unitie about that, why may they not also about whatsoever is clearly taught by God, which reason assures us to be all that is necessarie, and if you say that all things necessarie are not clearlie taught, because we do not (though it proves not that we might not) agree upon them, then I replie, that I may as well say, that neither is it cleare that there is a Guide, because we dissent from you in it, although receiving the authoritie of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture (out of which Cardinall <hi>Perron</hi> confesseth, that Saint <hi>Austine</hi> saith, that both the necessitie of your guide, the Church, and she her self, are to be known) and reason, which as they may be plain in this point for you, and yet perswade us not, so may they be in all necessarie points, and yet we who make theirs our ground, not perswade one another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:54903:157"/>
As little see I why there can be no Entitie nor Church, where there is no Unitie.</p>
               <p>For the first, though there be small Unitie among Christians, yet certainly Christians and their Religion have some Entitie, indeed if what you say were true, there were no Entitie in yours.</p>
               <p>For the second, I know not why two parties over-valuing their differences may not conceive each other to be none of the Church, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare even by excommunications, and yet remain both Parts of it, (for if a Husband misse-suspecting his Wife of Adulterie, declare her to be no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er his Wife, this cannot make her give over being so, if the bond be indeed not broken) as well as <hi>chrysostome</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> both excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by each other, and yet both Saints, or as particular men may by your own confession be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriorly in the Church, although seeming out of it, even to the Church her self, and so those be both of the Church between whom there is no Unity: For not onely in your own <hi>Cariophilus</hi> his words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> but also though the persons have power, yet if the cause have not sufficiencie, I take you to agree, that an excommunication is but a <hi>brutum fulmen,</hi> as Victors of the <hi>Asian</hi> Bishops: The best therefore and strictest definition (and which I think you will not refute) which I can give for the Church, is (especially in that sence, as out of it there can be no salvation) those who are desirous to know Gods Will, (or Christs at
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:54903:158"/>
the strictest, for I am not certaine, nor I beleeve is it defined among you, whether an explicite knowledge of Christ be absolutely necessarie to Salvation, though I know no guiltlesse ignorance of him, can bring unavoidably upon any man eternall torments) and ready, when known, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and follow it; and sure many of these may eternally disagree even in points which are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, abstracting from particular cases, and yet their differences not exclude them from the Church, and consequentlie a Church may be without Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, <hi>Quod erat demonstrandum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the Controversies mentioned, besides that <note place="margin">Resp.</note> there is a meanes to terminate them, they be such as bring no breach of the ancient life and action of Christians, which all those opinions do, which for the most part are reputed to make Hereticks.</p>
               <p>You saw verie well, that if [no Unitie, no Church] were a true Proposition, yours hath in <note place="margin">Repl.</note> it differencies enough to destroy its being a Church, and therefore are faine to applie what salves you can, but all in vaine: For your meanes to termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate them, doth not make them not to be before they are terminated, and consequently by your Rule yours is no Church till then. Besides, their bringing to breach of the ancient life and action of Christians proves not but one of them may be a Heresie, since you say not your selfe, that all Heresies are such; but onelie for the most part; and indeed to prove that, you must be able to set down what those opinions are, which before a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition may make a Heretick, which I beleeve you
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:54903:158"/>
will not venture to doe in haste, though we much desire it at your hands, that we may know if none of them be such.</p>
               <p>That some controversies amongst us are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, <note place="margin">Resp.</note> is a thing necessarie amongst humane affaires, where things must have a time to be born, to encrease, to fall, and the greater things are, the greater is their Period.</p>
               <p>It is true, that some time to be taken notice of <note place="margin">Repl.</note> must passe between an opinions rising, and being condemned; but that so long they should run on, and many of your Councels having since been held, is sure not necessarie, and shewes, that you esteem not Unitie so necessarie as you pretend: some opinions I am sure you can soon enough quash, as that not long since risen in <hi>Spaine</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Fornication being but a Veniall Sin: And whereas you say, the greater things are, the greater their period, though this be ture in some things, yet not in this, for sure the greater a difference is, the greater necessitie is there that it be soon decided, and so if your decision have power to effect it, as you pretend among you it hath, it must fall as soon as it is born, like the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Creatures that live but a day.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I do not see why this may hurt the Church, <note place="margin">Resp.</note> more then the suits, which hang in our Courts, preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the government of the Land.</p>
               <p>If any of these opinions be of that importance, <note place="margin">Repl.</note> as that though uncondemn'd the Holders are Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, as some may be, and my definition being concluded of such among you, some of these
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:54903:159"/>
may be some of them, then sure they hurt the Church much, and more then the Suites hurt the Government, which their hanging hurts not at all, though it hurts (sometimes unavoidablie) the Parties. But if where there is no Unitie, there were no Common-wealth, as you say, where there is no Uuitie, there can be no Church, then the Government were much prejudic'd by the Suits, as your Church by this rule, is made no Church by the differences; And indeed if men were not agreed about the power of the Governours (as you are not about some of your questions) it must be a maime to the government of any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, as consequentlie these are to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment of your Church.</p>
               <p>The last point of the Authors discourse is, to shew <note place="margin">Resp.</note> how errors might have crept in, wherein I shall have no opposition with him, for I doe not thinke the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is, how they should creep in, but how they should be kept out.</p>
               <p>Here Sir, I cannot but beleeve, that you inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <note place="margin">Repl.</note> to refresh your selfe with some Mirth, as with Musicke between the Acts; for though both our ends be, that errors should not creep in, yet the question was, whether it were possible that they might creepe in, and to my affirmative part it conduced to shew those waies, by which either they have entred, or easilie might doe so, this shewing how they may steale in, teacheth how to keep them out, as it is an aide to the saving of a Town, to discover the breaches, which cannot be guarded without they be first known.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:54903:159"/>
For the Fluxibility of humane Nature is so great, <note place="margin">Resp.</note> that it is no wonder if errors should have crept in, the wayes being so many; but it is a great wonder of God that none should have crept in. This never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse I may say, if the Author will confesse, as I thinke he will not deny, but that it is disputable, whether any error in sixteen Ages hath crept in, this very thing is above Nature. For if there were not an excellency beyond the nature of corruptible things, it would be undeniably evident, that not one or two, but thousands of errors had quite changed the shape of the Church in so many yeares, tempests, dis-uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, want of Commerce in the body of the Church.</p>
               <p>The greater wonder it were, if your Church <note place="margin">Repl.</note> had no error, the greater it is to me, that upon one, at most but probable, Reason, you should require all men to beleeve she hath none; Neither doth it appeare to me disputable, whether she have or no, but evident, that she hath, not by Demonstrations, yet by Probabilities of that multitude, and weight upon which you say (and say trulie) that in all other cases we relie, and venture that we most esteem: whereas indeed you, as you are of the imposing Partie, ought to bring at least such proofes, that you are fallen into none, and as you are of the Infallibilitie-pretending-partie, your proofes are likewise to rise from probable to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible: Neither doe I conceive it to be probablie argued, it is disputable, whether this bodie of men have ever let in any error, therefore it can never let in any, since it is at least as disputable, whether the <hi>Grecians</hi> have let in any, yet you will not allow,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:54903:160"/>
that upon this we should adjudge to her Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie: Nay if it were demonstrative, that your Church had yet never erred, yet it would but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willinglie follow, that she never could, since all things necessarie are so plaine (without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of which you seeme to tax God) and it is naturallie so plaine what is plaine, that I cannot but thinke it a miracle, that some one bodie of Christians among so many, should be free from any such dogmaticallie-defended error, especiallic if Truth were so indifferentlie sought after as it ought to be, and Passion were not often called to counsell, and Reason shut out of doores.</p>
               <p>But this one Maxime, that she receiveth her Faith <note place="margin">Resp.</note> by Tradition, and not from Doctors hath ever kept her entire: And he that will shew the contrary, must shew how it should come to passe, that those, who lived in such an Age, would say unto our Children, this we received from our fore-fathers, as taught them by our fore-fathers, to have been received from Christ and his Apostles from hand to hand, which if it could not be, the question is resolved, that no error is in the Church of God, which holdeth her faith upon that Tenure.</p>
               <p>Not to repeat, <hi>usque ad nauseam,</hi> what I have <note place="margin">Repl.</note> heretofore answered, as that others differing from you, hold upon the same Tenure that your selves have not alwaies held, nor hold not upon it, &amp;c. I will onelie tell you what Cardinall <hi>Perron</hi> tels me of the <hi>Jewes</hi> out of <hi>Isidore,</hi> and that is, that they seeing in the book of <hi>Wisedome</hi> so cleare proofes of Christ, plotted together to put it out of the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:54903:160"/>
Canon, which serves not so much his turne, if it were so, as it makes against yours, and shews how that might come to passe, which you judge impossible, the Posteritie of the <hi>Jewes</hi> having been deceived by this Complot; although pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending at least, and for ought appeares, beleeving that the Tradition of their Church is still uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</p>
               <p>And truely if the Author desires to examine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <note place="margin">Resp.</note> Religions, let him look their maine ground wherein they relie, and see whether that be good or no: And I think amongst Christians he shall find but two, Tradition, and Scripture,</p>
               <p>First, I allow not of your division, for not to <note place="margin">Repl.</note> say now that you relie not onely upon Tradition, these Protestants, whose part in this I take, depend not onelie upon Scripture, but upon Universall Tradition too, from which they receive that, and would more, if more seemed as clearly to them so to be delivered.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I think it reasonable not onely to examine what their Principles are, but whether they do constantly follow them, for a man may write awrie, that hath a streight Ruler, if he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it not carefully.</p>
               <p>And the Catholiques onely to relie upon Tradition, <note place="margin">Resp.</note> and all the rest upon Scripture; and he shall see, that relying upon Scripture cannot draw to an Unitie those who relie upon it, and more then one cannot relie upon Tradition.</p>
               <p>If all that relie upon Tradition be Catholicks, <note place="margin">Repl.</note> you must admit the Eastern Churches into your
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:54903:161"/>
Communion, although you now account them both Scismaticks and Hereticks: If all Catholicks do relie upon Tradition as their onelie grounds, and Tradition be so sure and infallible, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistakable a deliverer, as you would perswade us, how come so manie differences between you, some ever counting those things matter of Faith which others do not; which differences shew, if they all relie on these Questions, upon the ground you say they do, that more then one may relie upon Tradition, and neither can Tradition, any more then Scripture, draw to an Unitie, those who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie upon it; if either neither part do, or either do not, then Tradition is not the Common Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure of Catholicks, (not onelie in different opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, but even in such as are most <hi>de fide,</hi> and as both parts think nothing but a definition (and some scarce that) to make the Holders of the contrary to them Hereticks) since if it were, neither could one part of Catholicks relie upon any other then the Catholick ground, neither is it to be doubted, but that side which builds their opinion upon an Hereticall foundation against another, beleeved upon a Catholick ground, would long agone have been among you exploded, and the Pope have been not onelie with so much paines perswaded, but even of himselfe readie to have past his cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure upon them; if not for their superstructions, yet for their foundation.</p>
               <p>If I will be a Christian, I must be of one side. <note place="margin">Resp.</note> 
               </p>
               <p>If you mean I must be of one side, that is take <note place="margin">Repl.</note> one of these grounds, I answer, That I take both
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:54903:161"/>
one from the other, Scripture from Tradition, though not from the present Tradition of a Part, but from the Universall one of the first Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans opposed by none, but by them, who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantlie counted by the generallitie heterodox, and as soon opposed as known. If you mean that I must be of one side in points, I whollie denie any such necessitie.</p>
               <p>By falling on the one side, I see my fortune in <note place="margin">Resp.</note> thousands who have gone before me, to wit, that I shall be to seek all my life time, as I see they are, and how greatlie they magnifie verie weak pieces. On the other side, I see everie man who followeth, as farr as he followeth it, is at quiet.</p>
               <p>I see not but the greatest part of those who take <note place="margin">Repl.</note> the ground which you mislike, are yet setled and confident enough in their opinion, and if they continued alwaies seeking Truth for the love of it, I know not why they should be the lesse likely to find Heaven: Neither think I that you will say (nay it is plaine by your own words, that you will not say) that Saint <hi>Austine</hi> had been damned if he had died in his search, nor consequently any other in his case. And whereas you say, that all who follow the other, are at quiet as farr as they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, I answer, So are all who fixedly beleeve themselves to follow an infallible (although indeed a false) Guide, as the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> being led by their <hi>Mufty,:</hi> Which proves Quiet, no sufficient caution for Truth, nor Securitie for Safetie, and that, supposing yours the more easie and satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way, it followes not that it is the more reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:54903:162"/>
And for what you say of a mans duty to judge himself rigorously, whether he seek as he ought, I subscribe to that opinion, and approve of your Councell.</p>
               <p>Besides this, he must have this care, that he seek <note place="margin">Resp.</note> what the Nature of the subject can yeeld, and not as these Physitians, who when they have promised no lesse then immortality, can at last onely reach to some conservation of health, or youth in some small degree; So I could wish the Author well to assure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, First, that there is possible an infallibilitie, before he be to earnest to be contented with nothing lesse. For, what if humane nature should not be capable of so great a good, would he therefore think fitting to live without any Religion, because he could not get such a one as himself desired, though with more then a mans wish.</p>
               <p>What you now say, I confesse is very rationall, <note place="margin">Repl.</note> (as indeed all you say, is as much as your cause will suffer) and I require you not therefore to prove your opinions to be infallible by infallible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as necessarie to be done in it self, but as necessarie to be done by them, of whose opinions their Churches infallibilitie is not onelie a part, but a ground, and that the chief, if not the onelie one, and of which an infallible certaintie is the first and main condition of their Communion, and our want of it, one of their maine Objections against us.</p>
               <p>He that will make a judgement in an Art he is not <note place="margin">Resp.</note> Master in, if he be deceived, it is to be imputed to himself. The Phrase commandeth us to believe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:54903:162"/>
man in his Art, he who knoweth and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himselfe beleeveth not. Therefore when wee see Masters in an Art, we are not skild in, oppose us, we may beleeve we are in the wrong, which will breed this Resolution in the Author of the discourse, that if himself be not skild in all those waies in which he pursues his search, he must find himself obleiged to seek Masters, who be both well skilled, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being subject to faction also, very honest, and upright men, or else he doth not quitt himself before God.</p>
               <p>Truelie I am farr from being Master either in <note place="margin">Repl.</note> this or any other Art, but if for this cause I ought to doubt, and because much learneder persons oppose me, I ought to beleeve my self in the wrong, then so ought those of your part to do; who are as Ignorant as I, we having many much more learned then they who oppose them, and take our part, though therefore I think not of my self (what <hi>Tully</hi> in a Complement would perswade one of his Friends, that <hi>Nemo est qui sapientius mihi possit suadere meipso,</hi> yet I dare not chuse (as you would have me) some Master to search for me, and beleeve him blind-fold, (though if I would, I see no cause why to chuse any from among you, who have so many able Teachers at home (for you confessing that the matters are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Faction, and it being certaine, that not onelie who are honest is impossible to be known, but that eagernesse and desire to have, what they think Truth, prevaile, makes even the honest men sometimes deviate from the line of exact honestie,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:54903:163"/>
and lie for God, which he not onelie needs not, but forbids, (as is to be seen too frequentlie in the Quotations of both sides) I conceive it the best way to follow my own Reason, since I know I have no will to cozen my self, as they may have to cozen me: Especially since neither could I build upon such a way, an assent of such a degree, as your Church requires, since such Masters, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though learned, which I being unlearned may be deceived in, and honest, which all men might be deceived in, yet not infallible, could not in reason make me infallibly certaine of the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxnesse of that side, which they should chuse for me: So that what was said by the <hi>Pagan Solomon Socrates,</hi> (who yet was no confident man of his knowledge) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is my resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion too, and indeed in effect if not whollie, yet almost every mans, for those who trust their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son least, yet trust it in this, that some other instead of it is to be trusted, and so chuse who they are to trust, against which the Arguments either from the fallibilitie of Reason in generall, or in this particular remaine equally, an ignorant man being as likely to be deceived in the choice of his Guide, as in that of his Way, and that course being rather the shorter then the better, as ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the same, and no stronger a Bark, onelie venturing all his wealth at once.</p>
               <p>It is not all one not to incurre damnation for infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie, <note place="margin">Resp.</note> and to be in state of damnation; for the man to whom infidelitie is not imputed, may be in
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:54903:163"/>
state of damnation for other faults; as those were, who having known God by his works, did not glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him as they ought.</p>
               <p>That men may be damned for other faults con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes <note place="margin">Repl.</note> not our Question, nor indeed is any.</p>
               <p>Nay, they may be damned for want of Faith, and <note place="margin">Resp.</note> yet not be damned for incredulitie, As for example sake, if when they have sinned, they know not what meanes to have them forgiven, though they be without fault in not beleeving, neverthelesse dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without Remission of sin, they are not in state to come to life everlasting.</p>
               <p>This concernes no Christians, none of which <note place="margin">Repl.</note> that I know differs from you in the necessarie meanes of obtaining forgivenesse for sinnes, for though you require Confession, yet you allow that Contrition will save without it: Neither do I believe, but an imperfect Repentance caused through faultlesse Ignorance, of what it is for it to be perfect, will still be accepted by him who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards the Heart more then the Action; indeed onelie the Action, because of the Heart, and knowes, that if he use not the appointed meanes, it is onelie because he knowes it not, else conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the manie impositions from above the great frailtie within, and the great and manie tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions without, so that to fall into no sin, were morally impossible, he who <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:54903:164"/>
how to purge himself from them then he could possiblie know, God would not be desirous of the Salvation of all men, and it would seem agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to no Mercy, nor to any Justice, except that <hi>Summum jus,</hi> which ever hath been thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnable in man, and consequentlie incompatible in God.</p>
               <p>As the man who should venture into a wood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">Resp.</note> a Guide, although he did his best to have a guide, nothing lesse might fall out of his way as well as he who neglected the taking of one; so if God sent us his Son to shew us the way of Salvation, as well is he like not to be saved who never heard of such a way, as he that heard of it and neglected it, for neither of the two goeth that way: And who goeth not on the way, is not like to come to the end.</p>
               <p>The way is beleeving and obeying Christ, for <note place="margin">Repl.</note> them to whom He and his Commands are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlie proposed, I mean so, that it is their fault if they know them not: In generall then, it is seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Truth impartially, and obeying diligently what is found sincerely, and who treads this way, though he misse of Truth, shall not misse of his favour who is the Father of it, and if he be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Heaven, sure God meant that he should never come thither, and desires not that he and all else should, else he would not have proposed one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie such a way, which if it were possible for any to misse without his own fault, and which he knew that many would. Truely, that no opinion, that no error is a sin without the cause of it be one; and that God is not displeased with any man for not
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:54903:164"/>
seeing what it is not his fault that he doth not see, is agreeable to the common Notions of Justice, and God, and it is a verie good Negative way to trie superstructions by, to see whether they agree with these grounds of all Religion, whereof, rather then beleeve such men should be damned, I would beleeve they should be annihilated, or keep your Children companie, and have <hi>poenam damni,</hi> though not <hi>sensus.</hi>

               <p>I know God is good and mercifull: But I know his <note place="margin">Resp.</note> decrees as farr as we know are dispenced by the order of second Causes, and where we see no second Causes, we cannot presume of the effects; and how am I assured he will send Angels to illuminate such men as do their endeavonrs, that their Soules may not perish.</p>
               <p>A carefull search of Gods, and inclusively <note place="margin">Repl.</note> Christs will, and readinesse to obey it, is second Cause enough; For, for want of that second cause, we must not suppose any thing to the dishonour of of the First. As to beleeve, that they should be so punisht who do their endeavours, is to lay their damnation to Gods charge: One of the chiefe waies with which the Ancients opposed the <hi>Pagans,</hi> was shewing them that their Religion taught such things of their Gods, as no Reason would allow not to be dishonourable to the Diety. Now true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if when by this Argument we have rooted out the <hi>Pagan</hi> Gods, we lay as strange imputations upon the God of the Christians, what effect is it likely to produce, but onely to make men call for their old Gods againe, and think that we had as good kept those, who delighted in the Sacrifices of men,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:54903:165"/>
who deposed their Fathers, and eat their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as have changed hardly for the better. It is reported in the Ecclesiastical Historythat a Painter for drawing Christ in the likenesse of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> had his hand dried up, and certainlie they who figure him to themselves, and others with Attributes so contrary to his, and more fit for a <hi>Jupiter,</hi> do him much more wrong, then if they had drawn him <hi>Tela trisulca tenentem,</hi> with a thunder bolt in his hand. What Master, Father, or King, would not be esteemed a Tyrant, who should inflict not onelie an infinite, and an eternall, but a slight and a short punishment upon a Servant, Child, or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, for not doing when commanded, what the Commanders saw with all his endeavours, which he had diligently applied, he could not do; and shall we lay such an aspersion upon that God, (who though he be Justice it self, is more Mercifull then Just, who is <gap reason="foreign">

You may beleeve what you think fit, but rather then I will beleeve that any mans Soule that hath done his endeavours, not onelie shall, but that it is possible it should perish, (although not illuminated by Angels, which yet, if Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation were necessarie, I know some way or other he should have) rather then I will beleeve, either that any be damned for what is no sin, or that sin is <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:54903:166"/>
sort your Religion hath yet more) and that one dead flie would corrupt the whole ointment; the excellencie of the rest of the Doctrine of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie would be thought the Art, and the great and and manie miracles would be thought the Act of some evill <hi>Genius,</hi> such as befriended <hi>Apollonius,</hi> to ensnare men by those meanes into the beleef of that opinion, which so much derogates from the Maker of things, and the prevailing of it, though a very probable argument, would not serve for a Passe-Port to such an impossibilitie.</p>
               <p>But farr more do I doubt, whether ever man, who <note place="margin">Resp.</note> had not the way of Christ, or even of those who walked in it, did ever do his best (except some few, and very few, perhaps not two of Christ his greatest Favourites) and was not so culpable, that his Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would not have been imputed unto himself.

               </p>
               <p>How few their number is we will not dispute, <note place="margin">Repl.</note> since Gods justice is in them vindicated, and they, not He, the Author of their damnation. But neither beleeve I, that God is so rigorously just, as to stand readie to catch at a slip, (like an Usurer for the forfeiture of a bond) but is of long suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and Patience, and will as well accept our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, (joyned with amendment for this neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect in our search, as for other sinns: Howsoever I am so farre from thinking your prayer needlesse, that I both thank you for it humbly, and joyne with you in it heartilie; but <gap reason="foreign">

               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AFter much debate concerning the fittest expression of my duty to your Lordship, whether I ought by silence, seek to suspend your beleife of the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my selfe, I have made here, or by a clear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of it, assure you of what I may onely feare to present you with, as apprehensive of a mis-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted affection; I conclude, what was most satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory to my first, and immediate duty to God, was most justifiable to my second, and derivative to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Therefore I resolved so soone, to give you this ingenious accompt of my selfe: The greatest part of my life capable of distinction of Religions, hath been imployed in places, and conversant with persons, opposite to the Faith I was bred in, therefore it had been strange, if Naturall curiosity, without any spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall provocation, had not invited to the desire of looking with mine own eyes upon the foundation I stood upon, rather there holding fast blindfold by my education, to agree to be carried away alwayes after it, insensible of all shocks I met to unfasten me, and besides, I was solicited with the reproaches Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:54903:168"/>
presse upon Catholicks, that they blindly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve all the Impostures of the Church, without any illumination of the Judgements, this my thoughts injoyned, the clearest information of my selfe of the differences between us I could propose to my capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
            <p>So at my last journey into <hi>Italy,</hi> I did imploy all my leasure to a more justifiable settlement of my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife, as I then imagined, by a confirmation of my judgement, in what had been introduced by my birth and education. I began with this consideration, that there were two sorts of questions between the Catholicks and Protestants, the one of Right or Doctrine, the other of Fact or Story; As this, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Luther</hi> were the first Erector of the Protestants Faith, whether it had a visible appearance of Pastors and Teachers before his time, I resolved to begin my enquiry with the Question of Fact, for these Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
            <p>First, Because they were so few, and so compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible by all capacities, and the controversies of doctrine so intricate, and so many, as they required much time and learning for their disquisition, onely I found my selfe unprovided for both those requisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for this undertaking, and for the decision of the other, I needed not much presumption to beleeve my selfe a competent Judge, when it consisteth onely in the perusall of authentique Testimonies.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I considered, that there was no one point of controverted doctrine whereon all the rest depended, but that this one Question of Fact was such, as the dicision of it determined all the rest, for if
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:54903:168"/>
               <hi>Luther</hi> could be proved to be the Innovatour of the Protestants faith, it was necessary evicted, of not being the true ancient Apostolicall Religion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I began with this enquiry, which Protestants are bound to make to answer to this Objection, to find out an existence of some Professors of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Doctrines before <hi>Luthers</hi> time: for finding the Catholicks were not obligedto prove the Negative, it was my part, to prove to my selfe the Affirmative, that our Religion was no innovation by some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existence before that, but in the perusall of all the Stories or Records, Eccesiasticall, or Civill, as I could choose, I could finde no ancienter a dissention from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church then <hi>Waldo, Wickliffe,</hi> or <hi>Husse,</hi> whose cause had relation to the now-professed Protestancy, so as I found an intervall of about eight hundred yeares from the time, that all the Protestants confesse a Unity with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> down to those persons, without any apparent profession of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Faith. To answer my selfe in this point, I read many of our Protestant Authors who treated of it, and I found most of them reply to this sence, in which I cite here one of the most authentique, Doctor <hi>Whitaker</hi> in his Controversie 2. 3. pag. 479. where they aske of us, where our Church was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore for so many Ages? We answer, that it was in secret solitude, that is to say, it was concealed, and lay hid from the sight of men, and further, the same Doctor, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. pag. 502. our Church alwayes was; but you say it was not visible, doth that prove that it was not? No, for it lay hid in a solitary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment; to this direct sence, were all the answers
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:54903:169"/>
that ever I could meet to this Objection; I repeat no more, these places being so positive to our point. This confession of Invisibilitie in our Church for so many ages did much perplex me, it seemed to me, even to offend Naturall reason, such a derogation from Gods power or providence, as the sufferance of so great an Ecclipse of the light of this true Church, and such a Church as this is described to be, seeming to me repugnant to the maine reason, why God hath a Church on Earth, which is to be conserver of the Doctrine, Christs precepts, and to conveigh it from age to age, untill the end of the world. Therefore I applyed my study, to peruse such arguments as the Catholicks brought for the proofe of a continuall visibility of the true Church down from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles time in all Ages, and apparance of Doctors teaching and administring the Sacrament, in proofe of this I found they brought many provisoes of the Scripture, but this text most literall, of the fourth of the <hi>Ephesians, Christ hath placed in his Church, Pastors and Doctors, to the consummation of the saints, till we meet in the Unity of the Faith,</hi> and next the discourse, upon which they inferre this necessary visible succession of the Church, seemed to me, to be a most rationall and convincing one, which is to this effect, Naturall Reason not being able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to a man a cause that might certainly bring him to a state of supernaturall happinesse, and that such a cause being necessary to mankinde, which otherwise would totally faile of the end it was created for, there remained no other way, but that it must be proposed unto us by one, whose authority we could not
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:54903:169"/>
of, and that in so plaine a manner, as the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plest may be capable of it as well as the learned. This work was performed by our Saviour, from whose mouth all our Faith is originally derived, but this suceeding age not being able to receive it immediate from thence, it was necessary it should be conveyed unto them that lived in it, by those that did receive it from Christs own Mouth, and so from Age to Age untill the end of the world; and in what Age soever this thred of doctrine should be broken it must needs be acknowledged for the reason above mentioned, that the light, which should convey mankind through the darknesse of this world, was extinguished, and mankind is left without a Guide to infallible ruine, which cannot stand with Gods providence and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which Saint <hi>Austine</hi> affirmes for his opinion, directly in his book de Util. <hi>Cred. Cap. 16.</hi> saying, <hi>If divine providence doe preside over humane affaires, it is not to be doubted, but that there is some authoritie constituted by the same God, upon which going, as upon certaine steps, we are carried to God;</hi> nor can it be said he meant the Scriptures onely by these steps, sinoe experience shewes us the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall alteration about the right sence of severall of the most important places of it, that what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained there, cannot be a competent rule to mankind, which consisteth more of simple then leanned men; and besides, the Scriptures must have been supposed to have been kept in some hands, whose authority must beget our acceptance of it, which being no other thing then the Church in all Ages, we have no more reason
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:54903:170"/>
to beleeve, that it hath preserved the Scriptures free from all corruption, then that it hath maintained it selfe in a continuall visibility, which Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> concludeth to be a marke of the true Church, in these words, in his book <hi>Cont. Cecill. 104. The true Church hath this certaine signe, that it cannot be hid,</hi> therefore it must be known to all Nations; but that part of the Protestants is unknown to many, therefore cannot be the true; no inference can be stronger then from hence, that the concealement of a Church disproves the truth of it. Lastly, not to insist upon the allegation of the sence of all the Fathers of the Church in every severall Age, which seemed to me most cleare; that which in this cause weighed much with me, was the confession and testimony of the approved Doctors themselves of the Protestant Church, as <hi>Hooker</hi> in his Book of <hi>Eccles. Pol.</hi> pag. 126. <hi>God alwaies had, and must have some visible Church upon Earth:</hi> and Doctor <hi>Field,</hi> the first of <hi>Eccles. cap. 10. It cannot be, but those that are the true Church must be known by the profession of truth;</hi> and further, the same Doctor sayes, <hi>How should the Church be in the world, and nobody professe openly the saving truth of God;</hi> and Doctor <hi>White</hi> in his defence of the Way, <hi>chap. 4. pag. 790. The providence of God hath left Monuments and Stories for the confirmation of our faith;</hi> and I confesse truly, that our Religion is false, if a continuall descent of it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be demonstrated by these monuments down from Christs time; this appeareth unto me a direct sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:54903:170"/>
of themselves, to produce these apparent testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the publique profession of their faith, as the Catholiques demand; but this I could never read, nor know of any that performed; for Doctor <hi>White</hi> himselfe, for want of proofe of this, is faine to say in another place in his Way to the Church, pag. 510. <hi>The Doctors of our faith, hath had a continuall succession, though not visible to the world,</hi> so that he flies from his undertaking of a conspicuous demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the monuments of his faith, to an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible subterfuge, or a beleife without apparance; for he saith, in the same book in another place, pag. 84. <hi>All the eternall government of the Church may faile, so as a locall and personall succession of Pastors may be interrupted;</hi> and pag. 403. <hi>We doe not contest for an externall succession, it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth that they succeed in the doctrine of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and Faithfull, which in all ages did imbrace the same Faith;</hi> so as here he removeth absolutely all externall proofe of succession, which before he consented to be guided by. I cannot say, I have verbally cited these Authors, because I have translated these places, though the Originall be in English, yet I am sure, their sence is no way injured; and I have chosen to alledge Doctor <hi>Whites</hi> authority, because he is an Orthodox Professor of the Protestant Church; the reflection of the state of this question, where I found the Protestants defend themselves, onely by flying out of sight, by confessing a long invisibility in their Church in apparance of Pastors and Doctors; the same interpretation left me much loosened from the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:54903:171"/>
fastnesse of my professed Religion, but had not yet transported me to the Catholique Church, for I had an opinion, that our Divines might yet fill up this vacancy with some more substantiall then I could meet with, so I came back into <hi>England,</hi> with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of seeking nothing so intentively as this satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and to this purpose I did covertly (under another mans name) send this my scruple to one, whose learning and sufficiency I had much affiance in, in these termes, whether there was no visible suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession to be provedin the Protestant Church, since the Apostles time down to <hi>Luther,</hi> and what was to be answered to that Objection, besides the Confession of invisibility for so many ages, to this I could get no other answer, but that the point had been largely and learnedly handled by Doctor <hi>White,</hi> and many other of our Church: upon this I resolved to informe my selfe in some other points, which seemed to me unwarrantable and suspitious in the Ceremonies of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, since I had such aninducement as so little satisfaction in a point that seemed to me so essentiall; andin all these scruples, I found mine own mistake in the beleife of the Tenents of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, gave me the onely occasion of scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, not the practise of their doctrines, and to confirme me in the satisfaction of all them, I found the practise and authority of most of the ancient Fathers, and in the Protestant refutations of these doctrines, the recasations of their authorities, as men that might erre, so that the question seemed then to me, whether I would rather hazard the erring with them, then
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:54903:171"/>
with the latter Reformers, which consequently might erre also in dissenting from them: I will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to dispute the severall Tenents controverted, nor doubt that your Lordship will suspect, that I omitted any satisfaction in any of them, since my resolution, of reconciling my selfe to the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, is not liable to any suspition of too forward or precipitate resignation of my selfe, my judgement perchance may be censured of seducement, my affection cannot be of corruption.</p>
            <p>Upon these reasons I did, soone after my returne last into <hi>England,</hi> reconcile my selfe to the <hi>Romane</hi> Catholique Church, in the beleife and convincement of it, to be the true ancient and Apostolicall by her externall markes, and her internall objects of faith and doctrine; and in her I resolve to live and dye, as the best way to Salvation: When I was in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> I did not study dissimulation so dexterously, as if my fortune had read it to me, nor doe I now Legacie, for I doe not beleeve it so dangerous, but it may recover, for I know the Kings wisedome is rightly informed, that the Catholique Faith doth not tend to the alienation of the Subject, it rather super-infuseth a Reverence and Obedience to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie, and strengthens the bands of our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to our Naturall Prince, and his Grace and vertion of them from the naturall usuall exercise of themselves, upon those that have the honour to have beene bred with approbation of fidelity in

            <p>First, because having been sometimes in some degrees movedwith the same Inducements, I thought that what satisfied me, might possibly have the same effect upon him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, because I being a Lay man, a young man, and an Ignorant man, I thought a little Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son might in liklyhood work more from my Pen, then more from theirs, whose Profession, Age, and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies might make him suspect, that it is they are too hard for him, and not their Cause for his.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Because I was very desirous to do him ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, not onelie as a man, and a Christian, but as one, whom all that know him inwardly, esteeme of great parts, (and I am desirous somewhat to make up my great want of them, by my respect to those that have

            <p>Secondly, He saith, that there being two sorts of Questions, the one of Right, or Doctrine, the other of Fact, or Story; As whether the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants Faith had a visible appearance before <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> he resolved to begin his enquiry with the matter of Fact, as being sooner to be found, (because but one) and easier to be comprehended: To this I answer, by saying, that if they would not appeale from the Right Tribunall, or rather Rule, which is the Scripture, those many might casier be ended then this one, (we building our Faith onely upon plaine places, and all reasonable men, being sufficient of what is plain) but if they appeal to a consent of Fathers, and Councells, where of many are lost, many not lost not to be gotten, many uncertaine whether Fathers or no Fathers, and these, which we have, and know, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too many for almost any industrie to read over, and absolutely for any memory to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, (which yet is necessarie, because anyone clause of any one Father, destroies a consent) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

besides liable to all the exceptions which can be brought against the Scriptures, being the Rule, as difficulty, want of an infallible Interpreter, and such like, and being denied to have any infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (especially when they speak not as witnesses, which a consent of them never doth against us) by one partie, which the Scripture is allowed to have by both, then I wonder not if he think such a way so uncertaine, and so long, that he was willing to chuse any shorter cut, rather then travell it: Neither do I beleeve this other to be so short, or so concluding as he imagines, for if he consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the large extent of Christian Religion, so that we know little from any indifferent Relator of the opinions of the <hi>Abissins,</hi> so great a part of Christendome, if he consider the great industry of his Church in extinguishing those whom they have called Hereticks, and also their Books, so that we know scarce any thing of them, but from themselves, (who are too partiall to make good Historians) if he consider how carefully they stop mens mouthes, (even those of their own) with their <hi>Indices expurgatorii,</hi> it will then appear to him both a long work to seek, and a hard one to find, whether any thought like <hi>Luther</hi> in all Ages, and that he concludes very rashly, who resolves that there was none, because he cannot find any, since they might have been visible in their times, and yet not so to us, (for men are not the lesse vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible when they are so, for not being after remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered) as a man may be a Gentleman, though he know not his pedigree: So that as I will not
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:54903:174"/>
affirm that there were alwaies such, because I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove it, so neither ought they to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves sure there were none, without they could prove that which is impossible, and therefore no Argument can be drawn from thence; and if it could be proved, that such a no-waies-erring Church must at all times be, I had rather beleeve that there were still such, though we know them not, which may be true, then that theirs is it, which in my opinion cannot.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He saies that he could find no one point of controverted Doctrine, whereupon all the rest depended, but that this one Question of Fact was such, as the decision of it determined all the rest.</p>
            <p>To this I answer, That the Question of the Infallibilitie of the Pope, at least of those who adhere to him, which they call the Church, is such a one, as if determined, must determine all the rest, and not onely to us, but to all men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this (though granted necessarie, and determined to his wish) would indeed conclude against us, but not for them, since the <hi>Greek</hi> Church would put in as good a Plea upon the Title of Visibility, as that of <hi>Rome,</hi> and he would be to begin anew with them when he had ended with us.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He gives his reason, If <hi>Luther</hi> could be evicted to be the Innovator, his Religio is then evicted of not being the true ancient an and Apostolicall.</p>
            <p>To this I answer, by confessing the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; but he might be the Renovator, and not
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:54903:174"/>
the Innovator, and then no such consequence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, He saies we are bound to find an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence of some Professors of the reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion before <hi>Luther,</hi> which requirie is bound up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his supposition of the necessitie of a continuall succession of a visible, and no-waies erronious Church.</p>
            <p>Now I will first examine the sence of his tearms. By the first, I conceive [by a place he cites out of Saint <hi>Austine,</hi> that he meanes visible to all Nations, but I pray, hath his been alwaies so, I mean at least (for many Centuries) to those Nations, which <hi>Columbus</hi> hath not long since dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
            <p>By the second tearm Church, I suppose he meanes a Company of Christians holding neither more, or lesse then Christ taught, (for in a more large sence, no man denies the Church to have been alwaies in some degrees visible) and in this sence, I not onely deny it necessarie, that it should be alwaies visible, but that it should alwaies be, for I doubt whether there be, or for a long while, have been any such.</p>
            <p>Next, That such a one he meanes, appeares, because when Catalogues have been brought of some, who in all Ages have differed from them in things which we hold, his side would not accept of them, because they agreed not with us in all things, and yet when <hi>Campian</hi> intends to prove all the Fathers to be his, he useth onely this course of instancing, in some things wherein they agree
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:54903:175"/>
with him, (though sometimes not so much, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the contrary ought to be inferred, as in the instance of <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> for comparing his words with the Historie, it will appear, that he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him a Papist for not being perswaded by the Pope) though they differed from them in many other, as indeed all the notable Fathers did in more then one point. I will therefore say, that if this be required to shewing that a Church hath been ever visible, it is more then either part can do, and therefore I hope they will come upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter consideration to confesse that not necessarie for us to do, which is impossible for themselves. For let any man look into Antiquitie, I will not say without all prejudice, but without an absolute Resolution of seeing nothing in it that contradicts his present beleefe, and if he find not some opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as unknown unto An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, as either he, or I; as the Popes Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces having power to deliver out of Purgatorie, confest by Bishop <hi>Fisher,</hi> and <hi>Alphonsus de Castro,</hi> where they treat of Indulgences, if he find not others at first unknown, after known, but not held <hi>de fide,</hi> which are so at <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Prayer to Saints,</hi> their enjoying <hi>the Beatificall Vision before the day</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Tom. 9. An. 726. de fide &amp; Simbol.</note> 
               <hi>of Judgement, the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin, and her being free from all actuall sin,</hi> if he find not some wholly unknown, and absolutely condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which we condemne, as the lawfullnesse of Picturing God the Father, whereof the first is confest by <hi>Barronius</hi> in the Margent to an Epistle <note place="margin">2 Lib. C. 2.</note> of a Pope, which saies the same, and the latter to
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:54903:175"/>
be found in many places of Saint <hi>Austine, Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> and others, nay if he find not that all the Doctors, Saints, Martyrs of the two first Ages (I mean as many as are now extant, and speak of it) held something, which both parts condemne, as the opinions of the <hi>Chiliasts;</hi> If I say, he find not this, or I shew him not that he might have found it, I professe I will be ready to spend my life for that Church, against which I now employ my Pen: So that this will be the end, neither of your Churches have been alwaies visible, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the difference is this, that we are most troubled to shew our Church in the Latter, and more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Ages, and they theirs in the first and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, that we can least find ours at night, and they theirs at Noone. And whereas he expects that Doctor <hi>White</hi> should stand to this, to confesse his Religion false, if a continuall descent of it cannot be demonstrated, if he himself will please to grant as much as he exacts, if he but continue in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, and in this search, I doubt no more but that he will soone leave to be a Papist, then I should doubt if I saw him now receiving the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Kings Chappell, that he had done it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, His Reasons for the necessitie of the Visibility follow, because the contrary were a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation from Gods Power or Providence.</p>
            <p>I answer, To say he could not keep the Truth exactly in mens beleefe, were to derogate from Gods Power, to say he had not given sufficient meanes to find the Truth, and yet damned men
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:54903:176"/>
for error, the first would be a derogation from his Providence, the second from his Justice, but to say he suffers men to erre, who neglect the meanes of not erring, and that he damnes none for a meer error, in which the will hath no part, and consequently the man no fault, derogates from none of the three, but saies he, this is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the maine reason why God hath a Church upon Earth, to be the conserver of the Doctrine of Christ, and to conveigh it from Age to Age.</p>
            <p>I answer, To conserve it is every mans duty, but such as they may all faile in, and indeed is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the the form of the Church, then the end of the Church, an exact conservation making an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Church, and a lesse perfect conserving, a lesse perfect Church. As for conveighance of Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, the whole Church conveighs none, whereof many (if his be it) have had but little conveighed to them. Particular Christians (especially Past<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors) teach others, which it is every mans duty to do when he meets with them who want instruction, which he can give, and they are likely to receive, yet is not the instruction of others every mans maine end.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> I know perswades him, that some body of men are appointed to conveigh this Doctrine which men are to receive, onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they deliver it, and this I absolutely deny, for we receive no Doctrine from the Church upon the Churches authority, because we know her not to be the Church, till we have examined
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:54903:176"/>
her Doctrine, and so rather receive her for it, then it for her. Neither for the conveighance of the Truth, is it necessarie that any company of men in all times hold it all, because some may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh some Truthes, and others another, out of which, by comparing their Doctrine with the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, men may draw forth a whole and perfect body of Truth, and though they deliver few other Truthes, yet in delivering Scripture (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all necessarie Truth is conteined) they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all, and by that Rule, whosoever regulates his life and Doctrine, I am confident, that though he may mistake Error for Truth in the way, he shall never mistake Hell for Heaven in the end.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, His next reason is their common <hi>Achilles,</hi> the fourth of the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> which he chuseth onely to employ like his <hi>Triarios,</hi> his main Battle, leaving his <hi>Velites,</hi> his light-armed Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, some places too allegoricall, even in his own opinion to stand examination.</p>
            <p>The words are these,</p>
            <p>He hath given some Prophets, some Apostles, some <note place="margin">Vers. 11.</note> Evangelists, some Pastors, and some Doctors. For <note place="margin">12</note> the instauration of the Saints, for the work of the Ministery, for the Edification of the body of Christ, till we all meet in the Unity of Faith, and the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, and unto the measure of the Age of the fullnesse of Christ. That we may be no more Children tost and <note place="margin">13</note> carried about with every wind of Doctrine, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now out of this place I see not how a Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be evinced, rather I think it may, if that
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:54903:177"/>
Apostle meant none.</p>
            <p>For first, He saith not I will give, but he hath given, and who could suppose that the Apostles could say, that Christ had given, then the present Pope and the Doctors who now adhere to him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Allow that by what he hath given, were meant he hath promised, (which would be a glosse not much unlike to that which one of the most wittie, and most eloquent of our Modern Divines, Doctor <hi>Donne,</hi> notes of <hi>Statuimus</hi> (i) <hi>abrogamus</hi>) yet since these severall Nounes are governed by the same Verb, and no distinction put, it would prove as well a necessitie of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall Succession of Apostles, Prophets, and Evangelists, as of Pastors, and Doctors, which is more then either they can shew, or pretend they can, so that it seemes to me to follow, that these were then given to do this till then, and not a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of them promised, till then to do this, and so we receiving and retaining the Scriptures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in what they taught is contained, (as we would any thing else that had as generall and ancient a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, if there were any such) need no more, for if he say that men are tost for all the Scripture, I answer, so are they for all their Doctors, nay, if these keep any from being tost, it is the Scripture which does it, upon which their authoritie is by them founded upon their own Interpretation and Reason, who yet will not give us leave to build any thing upon ours out of plainer places, and though they tell us, that we cannot know the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures but from the Church, they are yet faine
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:54903:177"/>
(as appeares) to prove the authoritie of the Church out of Scripture, which makes me ask them in the words of their own <hi>Campian,</hi> and with much more cause <hi>Nihilne pudet Labyrinthi?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eighthly, There followes another reason to this sence, that reason not being able to shew man a way to eternall happinesse, and without such a one man would faile of the end to which he was ordained, it must be proposed by an infallible au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in so plaine a manner, as even the simple might be capable of it, which being performed by our Saviour, it must be conveighed to succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ages by those, who heard it from him, and whensoever this thread failed, mankind was left without a Guide to inevitable ruine.</p>
            <p>I answer, That though all this granted, it proves not against us, for we have the Scripture come down to us, relating Christs Doctrine, and written by those that heard it, which the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are capable of understanding, (I mean as much as is plaine, and more is not necessarie, since other Questions may as well be suffered without harme, as those between the <hi>Jesuites</hi> and the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans</hi> about Praedetermination, and between the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and allmost all the rest about the Immaculate Conception) and those who are not, neither are they capable out of Scripture to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the true Church, much lesse by any of those Noteswhich require much understanding and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as Conformity with the Ancients, and such like.</p>
            <p>Ninethly, The same answer I give to this,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:54903:178"/>
serves also to the following words of Saint <hi>Austine,</hi> for whereas Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> concludeth, that he could not meane the Scriptures as a competent Rule to mankind, which consisteth most of sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Persons, because there hath been continuall alterations about the sence of important places.</p>
            <p>I answer, That I may as well conclude by the same Logick, that neither is the Church a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Guide, because in all Ages there have also been disputes, not onely about her authority, but even which was she, and to whatsoever reason he imputes this, to the same may we the other, as to Negligence, Pride, Praejudication, and the like, and if he please to search, I verily beleeve he will find, that the Scriptures are both easier to be known then the Church, and that it is as easie to know what these teach, as when that hath defined; since they hold no decrees of hers binding <hi>de Fide,</hi> without a confirmation of the Popes, who cannot never be known infalliblly to be a Pope, because a secret <hi>Simony</hi> makes him none; no not to be a Christian, because want of due intention in the Baptizer makes him none, whereof the latter is alwaies possible, and the first in some ages likely; and in hard Questions a readinesse to yeeld when they shall be explained, me thinks should serve as well as a readinesse to assent to the decrees of the Church, when those shall be pronounced.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, He saith that the Scripture must be kept safe in some hands, whose authority must beget our acceptance of it, which being no other then the Church of all ages, we have no more reason to
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:54903:178"/>
beleeve that it hath preserved that free from Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, then it self in a continuall visibilitie.</p>
            <p>I answer, That neither to giving authority to Scriptures, nor to the keeping of them, is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a continuall visibility of a no-waies erring body of Christians; the Writers of them give them their authority among Christians, nor can the Church move any other, and that they were the Writers, we receive from the generall Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and Testimony of the first Christians, not from any following Church, who could know nothing of it but from them, (for for those parts, which were then doubted of by such as were not condemned for it by the rest, why may not we remain in the same suspence of them that they did) and for their being kept and conveighed, this was not done onely by their Church, but by others, as by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and there is no reason to say, that to the keeping and transmitting of records safely, it is required to understand them perfectly, since the old Testament was kept and transmitted by the <hi>Jewes,</hi> who yet were so capable of erring, that out of it they looked for a Temporall King, when it spoke of a Spirituall; and me thinks the Testimony is greater of a Church which contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts the Scripture, then of one which doth not, since no mans witnessing is so soon to be taken, as when against himself, and so their Testimonie is more receiveable, which is given to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures by which themselves are condemned. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the generall reverence which ever hath been given to these Books, and the continuall use of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:54903:179"/>
them (together with severall parties, having alwaies their eyes upon each other each desirous to have somewhat to accuse in their adversaries) give us a greater certaintie, that these are the same wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings then we have, that any other ancient book is any other ancient Author, and we need not to have any erring Company preserved to make us surer of it: Yet the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as infallible a Depositarie as she is, hath suffered some variety to creep into the Coppies in some lesse materiall things, nay, and some whole Books (as they themselves say) to be lost, and if they say, how then can that be rule whereof part is lost? I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, That wee are excused if we walk by all the Rule that we have, and that this maketh as much against Traditions being the Rule, since the Church hath not looked better to Gods unwritten Word, then to his written, and if she pretend she hath, let her tell us the cause why Antichrists comming was deferred, which was a Tradition of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> and which without impudence she cannot pretend to have lost? And if againe they say, God hath preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all necessary Tradition. I reply, so hath he all necessarie Scripture, for by not being preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, it became to us not necessarie, since we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be bound to beleeve and follow that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find.</p>
            <p>But besides, I beleeve that which was ever ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary is contained in what remaines, for <hi>Pappias</hi> saith of Saint <hi>Mark,</hi> that he writ all that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> preacht, as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> doth, that <hi>Luke</hi> writ all
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:54903:179"/>
that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> preacht, nay, <hi>Vincentius Lirinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi> though he would have the Scripture expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ancient Tradition, yet confesseth that all is there which is necessary, (and yet then there was no more Scripture then we now have) as indeed by such a Tradition as he speakes of, no more can be proved then is plainly there, and almost all Christians consent in; and truely I wonder, that they should brag so much of that Author, since both in this and other things, he makes much against them, as especially in not sending men to the present <hi>Roman</hi> Church for a Guide, a much readier way, (if he had known it) then such a long and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Rule, as he prescribes, which indeed it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that almost any Question should be ended by.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, He brings Saint <hi>Austines</hi> authority to prove, that the true Church must be alwaies vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible; but if he understood Church in Mr <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagues</hi> sence, I think he was deceived, neither is this impudent for me to say, since I have cause to think it but his particular opinion, by his saying (which Cardinall <hi>Perron</hi> quoted) that before the <hi>Donatists,</hi> the Question of the Church had never been exactly disputed of, and by this, being one of his maine grounds against them, and yet claiming no Tradition, but onely places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, most of them allegoricall, and if it were no more, I may better dissent from it, then he from all the first Fathers, (for <hi>Dionysius Areopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gita</hi> was not then hatcht) in the point of the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liasts,</hi> though some of them (<hi>Pappias</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi>)
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:54903:180"/>
claimed a direct Tradition, and Christs owne words.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As useth this kind of libertie, so he professeth it in his nineteenth Epistle, where he saith, that to Canonicall Scriptures he had learnt to give the reverence, as not to doubt of what they said, because they said it, from all others he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected proofe from Scripture or Reason.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> condemnes severall opinions of his, and therefore she ought not to find fault with them who imitate her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Twelfthly, He addes two reasons more,</hi> The consent of the Fathers of all ages, And the confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Protestants.</p>
            <p>To the Frst I answer, That I know not of any such, and am the more unapt to beleeve it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> vouchsafes not to insist up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, nor to quote any, which I guesse he would have done, but that he misdoubted their strength.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Suppose that all the Fathers which speake of this, did say so, yet if they say it but as private Doctors, and claime no Tradition, I know not why they should weigh more then so many of the now learned, who having more helpes from Arts, and no fewer from Nature, are not worse searchers into what is Truth, though lesse cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of being Witnesses to what was Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They themselves often professe they expect not to be read as Judges, but as to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their and our Rule, the Canonicall Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:54903:180"/>
Fourthly, Let him please to read about the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate Conception <hi>Rosa Salmeron,</hi> and <hi>Wadding,</hi> and he will find me as submissive to Antiquity, even whilst I reject it, as those of their own Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for they to prefer new opinions before old, are faine to prefer new Doctors before old, and to confesse the latter more perspicatious, and to differ from those of former times, with as little scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">6 Cap. St. Johan.</note> as he would from <hi>Calvin,</hi> (whom <hi>Maldonat,</hi> on purpose to oppose, confesseth he chuseth a new Interpretation, before that of all the Ancients, which no witnesse but my eyes could have made me beleeve) nay, and produce other points where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their Church hath decreed against the Fathers, to perswade her to do so againe, althoug <hi>Campian</hi> with an eloquent brag, would perswade us, that they are all as much for him, as <hi>Gregory</hi> the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth who was then Pope.</p>
            <p>To the Second I answer, That Infallibility is not by us denied to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with an intention of allowing it to particular Protestants, how wise and learned soever.</p>
            <p>Thirteenthly, He saies next, that he after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to inform himself in other points which seemed to him unwarrantable, and superstitious, and found onely his own mistakes gave him occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Scandall.</p>
            <p>To this I answer, That I cannot well answer any thing, unlesse he had specified the points, but I can say that there are many, as picturing God the Father, (which is generally thought lawfull, and as generally practised) their offerings to

the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> (which onely differs from the Heresie of the <hi>Colltridians,</hi> in that a Candle is not a Cake) their praying to Saints, and beleeving <hi>de fide</hi> that they heare us, though no way made cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that they do so, and many more, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mistake of his might have given him occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to be still scandalized: For whereas he saith that those points were grounded upon the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ancient Fathers, which was refused as insufficient by Protestants.</p>
            <p>I answer, That none of these I name have any ground in the Ancientest, nay, the first is by them disallowed, and if any other superstition of theirs have from them any ground, yet they who depart from so many of the Ancients in severall opinions, cannot by any reason be excused for retaining any error, because therein they consent, nor have the Protestants cause to receive it from them as a sufficient Apologie, neither hath he to follow the Fathers rather then Protestants, in a cause, in which not the Persons, but the Reasons, were to have been considered. For when Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> was by this way both brought into, and held in a strange error, though he speakes something like Mr. <hi>Mountague, Patiaris me errare cum talibus,</hi> Suffer me to erre with such men, yet he could not obtaine Saint <hi>Austines</hi> leave, who would not suffer him, but answered their Reasons, and neglected their Authorities.</p>
            <p>Fourteenthly, He speakes of his Religion su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-infusing Loyalty, and if he had onely said it destroied or weakned it not, I (who wish that
<pb facs="tcp:54903:181"/>
no doubt of his alleagiance may once enter his mind, to whom we all owe it, but professe my self his humble Servant, and no waies his enemy, though his adversarie) would then made no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, but since he speakes as if Popery were the way to obedience, I cannot but say, that though no Tenet of their whole Church (which I know) make at all against it, yet there are prevailing opinions on that side, which are not fit to make good subjects, when their King and they are of different perswasions. For besides that Cardinall <hi>D' Ossat</hi> (an Author which Mr. <hi>Mountague,</hi> I know, hath read, because whosoeuer hath but considered State matters, must be as well skilled in him, as any Priest in his Breviary) tell us, that it is the <hi>Spaniards Maxime,</hi> That Faith is not to be kept amongst Hereticks, and more, that the Pope intimated as much in a discourse, intended to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the King of <hi>France</hi> to forsake the Queen of <hi>England;</hi> he saith moreover, speaking in another place, speaking about the <hi>Marquizat</hi> of <hi>Saluces,</hi> that they hold at <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Pope, to avoid a probable danger of the encreasing of Heresie, may take a Territory from the true Owner, and dispose of it to another, and many also defend, that he hath power to depose an Hereticall Prince, and of Heresie he makes himself the Judge; So that though I had rather my tongue should cleave to the roofe of my mouth, then that I should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that a Papist may be a good Subject, even to a King whom he accounts an Heretick, since I veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>y beleeve, that I my self know very many, very
<pb facs="tcp:54903:182"/>
good: yet Popely is like to an ill aire, wherein though many keep their healthes, yet many are infected, (so that at most they are good Subjects but during the Popes pleasure) and the rest are in more danger, then if they were out of it.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I beleeve that what I have said may at least serve (if he will descend to consider it) to move Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> to a further search, and for <hi>Memorandums</hi> in it, which if it do, he will be soone able to give as much better Reasons for my conclusion, (that such a Visible Church neither need, nor can be shewed) as his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is degrees above mine. I hope also by comparing the body of their beleefe, and the ground of their authority, the little that can be drawn out of the fourth of the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> with the Miriads of contradiction in Transubstantiation, he will come to see, that their Pillars are too weak to hold up any building, be it never so light, and their building is too heavie to be held up by any Pillars, be they never so strong, and trust he will return to us, whom he will find that he hath cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessely left, if he be (which I doubt not) so inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous, as not to hold an opinion, because he hath turned to it, nor to stay, onely because he went.</p>
