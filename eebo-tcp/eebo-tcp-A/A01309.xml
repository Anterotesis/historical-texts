            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Doe you not see nowe how flatly Maister Fulke confesseth that it was so? Such confessions as these, are nowe &amp; than extorted out of the auncient fathers writings, which are not liuing to expounde their meanings. But I had thought Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Martin could haue discerned betwene a suppose or concession, and an absolute assertion, or a flat confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, especially of one whose writing is plaine enough, and beside is aliue to interprete himselfe, if any ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guitie were therein. But be it that Maister Martin ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would not, or could not see in my writing any thing else but a flat confession of Luthers denying of S. Iames epistle, and calling it an epistle of strawe, of what fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head proceedeth it, that he willeth Maister Whitaker to aske Caluin <hi>in argum. Epist. Iacobi,</hi> whether Luther so
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2866:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
speake of that epistle? in which argument Luther is not once named by Caluin, so farre is it, that he doth testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie any such thing against Luther. Onely he sayth, that some there are in these dayes, which thinke that epistle not worthy of authoritie, which could not be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of Luther, who long before Caluin wrote that argument, had forsaken that opinion, if euer he helde any such, as all those Dutche Bibles and Testaments of Luthers translation, in which those wordes so muche bayted at, and so much sought for are omitted, doe giue sufficient testimonie. What <hi>Flaccus Illyricus</hi> reporteth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who perhaps helde that opinion him selfe, and woulde father it vppon Luther, I haue neither opportunitie to seeke, nor care to knowe. But howe great a matter it is, that all the Popish Germans, and other, who haue written against Luther, doe so spitefully gnawe vpon, I haue learned at length by relation of Maister Whitaker. whome you send to aske of me: who after long search and many editions turned ouer, at the length lighted vpon a Dutch Testament, by likehood one of the first that Luther did sette forth in the German tongue, in which he findeth neither deniall of S. Iames epistle to be Canonicall, nor affirmation that it is vnworthy of an Apostolicall spirit, no nor that whereof there hath bene so much babling of all the Papistes, that he calleth it an epistle of strawe simply, and in contempt, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in comparison of the epistles of Paule and Peter, and other bookes of the newe Testament, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of which one aboue an other, after he hath shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in sundry degrees, at last he sayth, the epistle of Iames in comparison of these, is strawye, or like straw. Which he sayth not in respect of the credit or authority thereof, but in regarde of the argument or matter handled therein, which all wise and godly men will confesse to bee not so excellent and necessary, as the matter of the holye Gospels and Epistles of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Apostles, namely of Paule, Peter, and Iohn.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2866:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Our Sauiour Christ himself, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> calleth the doctrine of regeneration, in such plaine maner as he vttered it, to Nicodemus, earthly things in comparison of other grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mysteries, which he coulde haue expressed in more heauenly &amp; spirituall sort. If I haue spoken to you (sayth he) of earthly things, and you haue not beleued, how if I shoulde speake to you of heauenly things, will you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue? Were not he an honest and a wise man, that vpon these words of Christ spoken in comparison, would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude by his authoritie, that regeneration were a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible matter, a thing not spirituall, not heauenly, but simply and altogither earthly. And yet with, as good reason, for ought I see or can learne of Luthers wordes concerning this matter, he might so inferre, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists doe inforce, the like against Luther. Wherefore it is nothing else but a famous and infamous cauillation, to the confusion of all the Papistes which write against Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that no one of them omitteth vpon so false and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous a ground, to sclaunder him so haynously, and to charge all Protestantes with his assertion so enuiously: which if it were his, should not be so euill as other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike writers haue affirmed of that Epistle, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not sufficient to charge him, and much lesse others with heresie: but being not his simple affirmation, yet because it hath bene offensiuely taken, he him selfe hath put it out, and giuen it ouer.

with the rest of the scriptures, &amp; not for Caluins pleasure we receiue the Epistle of S. Iames, though it hath not bene alwaies, and of all Churches receiued.

This may serue for a cleare demonstration, that in the first English Bibles that were printed vnder the name of Thomas<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Anno.</hi> 1532. <hi>Anno.</hi> 1537.</note> Mathew, before Caluine wrote any word of the reiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of those bookes, or of receiuing of the other, they are called Apocrypha, &amp; printed with other of that marke, by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, &amp; the Epistle of S. Iames without any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion acknowledged to be one of the canonical Epistles, wheras Caluines Institution was first printed An. 1536. &amp; his argument vpon S. Iames Epistle 1551. You may see what honest dealing the Papistes vse, to bring the truth into discredit, &amp; the professors thereof into hatred with the simple &amp; vnlearned people, bearing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in hand, that we haue no cause to receiue or refuse bookes of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but Caluines pleasure. But the God of truth wil one day reward these impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t liars &amp; shameles slaunderers.</p>
                        <p>Well let vs now see vnder what prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, it pleased Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine to reiect these bookes. <hi>Vnder pretence forsooth</hi> (sayth Martin) <hi>that they were once doubted of, and not taken for Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical.</hi> I pray you sir, where doth Caluine pretend that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cause?

                        <p>FVLK. 10. As for peeces of Daniel, &amp; of Hester, we reiect none, but only we discerne that which was written by Daniel in deede, from that which is added by Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotion the false Iew, &amp; that which was written by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God of Esther, from that which is vainly added by some Greekish counterfecter. But the reason why we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect those patches (you say) is because they are not in the Hebrew, which reason <hi>S. Augustine</hi> reiecteth. Here you cite <hi>S.

For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer was such, <hi>S. Hierom</hi> did thrust through with a spit or obeliske, as not worthy to be receyued. Witnes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>S.

Interpreters, whose reasons as they were but friuolous, so they are derided by <hi>S. Hierom,</hi> who being learned in the Hebrew &amp; Chaldee tongues, refused to be taught by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> that was ignorant in them, what was to be done in translations out of them. Also <hi>Hieronym</hi> him selfe testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth that <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Hebrew, hath neither the story of <hi>Susanna,</hi> nor the hymne of the 3. children, nor the fable of Bel &amp; the Dragon: which we (saith he) because they are dispersed throughout the whole world haue added, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a spit before them, which thrusteth them through, lest we should seeme among the ignorant to haue cut of a great part of the booke. The like he writeth of the

vaine additions that were in the vulgar edition vnto the booke of Esther, both in the Preface, &amp; after the ende of that which he translated out of the Hebrew.

The additions vnto the booke of <hi>Esther</hi> in many places, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray the spirite of man, as that they are contrary to the truth of the story, containing vaine repetitions, &amp; ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of that which is contained in the true historie, &amp; that which most manifestly conuinceth the sorgerie, that in the epistle of <hi>Artaxerxes, cap.</hi> 16. <hi>Haman</hi> is called a Macedonian, which in the true storie is termed an Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gite that is an Amalekite, whereas the Macedonians had nothing to doe with the Persians many yeares after the death of <hi>Esther &amp; Haman.</hi> I omit that in the <hi>ca.</hi> 15. <hi>ver.</hi> 12. the author maketh <hi>Esther</hi> to lie vnto the king in saying that his countenance was ful of all grace, or else he lyeth him selfe, <hi>v.</hi> 17. where he saith, the king beheld her in the veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of his anger, &amp; that he was exceding terrible.</p>
                        <p>As for other reasons, which you suppose vs to follow, because these parcels were once doubted of by certaine of the fathers, it is a reason of your owne making, and therefore you may confute it at your pleasure. <hi>But if that be true which Maister Whitaker by a figuratiue speech doth</hi>

                        <p>FVLK. 12. If you know so well that the auctoritie of the Canonical scripture, standeth not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the auctor: as in deede it doth not. For the bookes of Iudges, of Ruth, of Samuel the later<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Kings, &amp;c. who can certainly affirme by whom they were written? with what forehead do you charge vs to doubte of the auctoritie of this epistle, because we reporte out of the auncient writers, the vncertaintie of the auctor? or leaue out that title whiche is not certainely true? <hi>But yet</hi> (you say) <hi>to be Paules or not Paules, apostolicall or not apostolicall, maketh great difference of credite and esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi> If by apostolicall you meane of apostolicall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite or auctoritie, I agree to that you say of apostolical, or not apostolicall. If you meane apostolicall that only which was writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by some Apostle, you will make great difference of credite &amp; estimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betweene the Gospell of Marke, Luke, and the Actes of the Apostles, from the gospels of Mathew and Iohn. But which of vs I pray you that thinketh that this epistle was not writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by S. Paul,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:2866:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
once doubteth whether it be not of Apostolicall spirite and auctoritie? Which is manifest by this, that both in preaching and writing wee cite it thus, <hi>the Apostle to the Hebrewes.</hi> And if it were written by S. Luke, or by S. Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which both were Apostolike men, seing it is out of controuersie that it was written by the spirite of God, it is doubtlesse Apostolicall and differeth not in credite and estimation from those writings that are knowen cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to haue bene writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Apostles. But I maruel greatly why you write, that to be Paules or not Paules, maketh great difference of credite &amp; estimation. Those epistles that are Peters and Iohns are not Paules, &amp; yet I thinke their is no great difference of credite &amp; estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betweene them &amp; Paules. What you thinke I know not, but you write very suspitiously. You aske what made S. Iames epistle, or the second of Peter and the rest, to be sometimes doubted of, but that they were not thought to be the epistles of those Apostles? Yes, something else, or else they doubted vainely of them, and without iuste cause, as I thinke they did. But when their were two A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles called Iames, he that doubteth whether the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle was written by Iames the brother of Iohn, &amp; is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded it was written rather by Iames the sonne of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaeus,</hi> doubteth nothing of the credit, auctoritie, &amp; esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the epistle. No more doe wee, which doubt whether the epistle to the Hebrewes were written by S. Paule, seeing we are perswaded it was written either by S. Barnabas, or by S. Luke, or by S. Clement, as the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writers thought, or by some other of the Apostles or Euangelists, we make no question but that it is Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall, and of equall auctoritie with the rest of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly scriptures. But Eusebius denied the epistle of S. Iames, because he was perswaded that it was written by no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle or Apostolike man, and therefore saith plainly that it is a bastard or counterset: and so belike was Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deceiued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if euer he denied it, as you say he did. <hi>But if titles of bookes be of no importance</hi> (say you) <hi>then leaue out</hi>

                           <hi>Matthew, Marke, Iohn, and Paule in his other Epistles.</hi> What nede that I pray you? Is there no difference betwene lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing out a title whereof there hath bene great vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and diuersitie in Gods church, and which in some Greeke copies both written and printed is left out: and in leauing out those titles that neuer were omitted, nor neuer any question, or controuersie moued of them by any of the auncient catholike fathers? But you will vs to vrge no more the title of the Apocalypse of S. Iohn the Diuine, as though it were not S. Iohn the Euangelistes, &amp; we shall please I know not what heretikes of our time except it be the Papistes whom it would most concerne, that the reuelation of S. Iohn in which their Antichrist of Rome is so plainly described were brought out of credit. But if you had read Bezaes preface before the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalypse, you should finde that euen by that title, he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth a probable argument, that it was written by Iohn the Euangelist, because it is not like that this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent name THE DIVINE coulde agree to any Iohn in the Apostles time so aptly, as to Sainct Iohn the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist, beside the consent of al antiquitie, ascribing that Reuelation to Sainct Iohn the Euangelist and Apostle. <hi>Last of all</hi> (you say) <hi>it is most certaine and we knowe best by our vsuall doings, that it is a principall way to discredit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny booke, to deny it to be the authors vnder whose name it hath bene receyued.</hi> Howe certaine it is with you, whereof no man else but you can see any light of reason or necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of conclusion, I knowe not, but wee are not so voyde of witte, if we lacked honestie, that we would discredite Paules Epistle, by saying it was Peters, or Augustines sermon, by saying it was Ambrose, or Chrysostomes worke by saying it was Basils. But if wee would bring any booke out of credite by denying the auctor whose title it hath borne: wee would rather intitle it to some other writer of lesse credite, or later tyme, or by some other argumentes proue it vnworthie of credite, not by onely denying it to be the auctors, vnder whose name

                        <p>FVLK. 15. Why shoulde you not at your pleasure vpon your false assumption generall, inferre one or two slaunders particular. M. Whitaker defendeth that it was well said of Luther. <hi>That he esteemed not the worth of a rush a thousand Augustines, Cyprians, Churches, against himselfe.</hi> Woulde God that euery Papist would reade his owne words in the place by you quoted, that he might see your impudent forgerie. For I hope there is no Christian, that will imagine, that either Luther would so speake, or any man of honestie, defend him so speaking. For Luther was not so senselesse, to oppose his owne person, but the truth of his cause, grounded vpon the holy Scriptures, not only against one thousand of men, holding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, but euen against tenne thousand of Angels, if they should oppose them selues against the truth of God. But I am too blame to deale so much in M.

                        <p>The next cauil is vpon M. Rainoldes words, in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to his sixe positions, disputed vpon at Oxford, where against Cyprian, affirming that the Church of Rome can not erre in faith, he sayth: <q>Pardon me Cyprian, I would gladly beleeue thee, but that in beleeuing thee, I shoulde not beleeue the Gospel.</q> These wordes you confesse that he spake figuratiuely, and finely, as he thought: but that he vsed the figures of Ironve and concession, you will not acknowledge, but all other men may easily see. For first he no where graunteth, that S. Cyprian affirmeth, that the Churche of Rome can not erie in fayth. But immediatly before the wordes by you translated, after he had proued out of the eleue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th to the Romans, that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2866:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the particular Church of Rome may be cut of, as well as the Church of the Israelites, which were the naturall braunches, he asketh the question <hi>Quid? &amp; Cypriano se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus est visum?</hi> What? And did it seeme otherwise to <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian?</hi> Pardon me <hi>Cyprian, &amp;c.</hi> His meaning is plaine, that Cyprian thought not otherwise than S. Paule hath written, or if he did, it was lawfull to dissent from Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian. As a litle after he sayth: <hi>Quare si Romanam Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am errare non posse, &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore if Cyprian thought that the Church of Rome could not erre in that point, by the sentence of the Papistes, he him selfe is to be condemned of errour: for diuerse Papistes whome he nameth, confesse that euery particular Church may erre, and Verratus, one of them, affirmeth that the Church of Rome is a particular Church, which the rest can not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. And in deede that which Cyprian writeth, is about certaine runneagate Heretikes, that flying out of the Church of Carthage, sought to be receiued of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church of Rome. All this while here is no graunt that Cyprian affirmeth, that the Church of Rome cannot erre in faith. And if Cyprian had so affirmed contrary to the scripture, it might haue bene iustly replied vnto him, which S. Augustine saith when he was pressed with his authoritie. <hi>Contra Crescon. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 31. <hi>Nos nullam Cypriano facimus iniuriam.</hi> We do <hi>Cyprian</hi> no wrong, when we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish any writings of his from the Canonical autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the diuine Scriptures. And in truth the wordes which <hi>M. Rainolds</hi> before cited out of <hi>S. Cyprian, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>ep</hi> 3. <hi>ad Cornel.</hi> are spoken of no matter of faith, but in a matter of discipline. Neither doth Cyprian say, that the Church of Rome can not erre in faith, but that those Heretikes which brought letters from schismatikes &amp; profane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, did not consider, that they are Romans, whose faith is praised by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation, or preaching of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, to whom <hi>perfidia,</hi> falshood, or false dealing can haue none accesse. Meaning that the Romans so long as they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue in that faith which was praised by the Apostle, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <pb n="37" facs="tcp:2866:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not ioyne with Heretikes and Schismatikes, that are cast out of other Catholike Churches. For that he could not meane that the Pope or Church of Rome cannot erre in faith (as the Papistes affirme) it is manifest, for that in a question of religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he dissented both from the Bishop and Church of Rome, as all learned men knowe he did, which he would neuer haue done, if he had beleeued they could not erre. <q>And that his meaning was not that the Bishop of Rome could not erre in matters of disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, it is manifest in the next epistle, where he complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that Basilides a wicked man, after his crimes were detected, and his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science made bare by his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, went to Rome, and deceyued our fellow Bishop Stephanus, dwelling farre of, and being ignorant of the case, so that he sought ambitiously to be vniustly resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the Bishoprike from whence he was iustly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. These things proue, that S. Cyprian thought it no impossible thing, for the Bishops and Church of Rome to erre in faith or gouernment.</q> Wherefore that you cite out of Augustine agreeth best vnto your selfe, and such as you are, who imploy al your eloquence and vtterance, to set foorth lies and slaunders. Laste of all, when you haue nothing else to disgrace those graue and learned writers, you woulde make them by abusing a peece of Tullie, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temptible for their youth, among such as know them not, who if they wanted half a score yeares a peece, of that ripe and well seasoned age they haue, yet with those giftes of godlinesse and learning, which God hath in great measure bestowed vpon them, they were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be reuerenced.

be disswaded by S.

And truly men of the Latine tongue, whom we haue now taken in hand to instruct, haue neede also of two other tongues vnto the knowledge of the diuine Scriptures, namely the Hebrue, &amp; the Greeke, that recourse may be had vnto the former copies, if the infinite varietie of the Latine interpreters shal bring any doubt, although we find ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times in the bookes, Hebrue words not interpreted, as <hi>Amen, Alleluia, Racha, Osanna, &amp;c.</hi> and a litle after <hi>Sed no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> propter haec pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca &amp;c.</hi> But not for these few wordes which to marke and inquire of, it is a very easie thing, but for the diuersities (as it is said) of the interpreters, the knowledge of those tongues is necessarie. For they that haue interpreted the scriptures out of the Hebrue to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue into the Greke tong, may be nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred, but the Latine interpreters by no means can be numbred. For in the first times of the faith, as a Greeke booke came into euery mans hand, &amp; he seemed to haue some skill in both the tongues, he was bold to interpret it. Which thing truly hath more helped the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, than hindred, if the readers be not neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: for the looking vpon many bookes, hath often times made manifest sundry obscure or darke sentences.</q> This is S.

But let vs see what be the absurdities, that you gather of our defending the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall texts of both the tongues. First, we must needes reiect the Greeke of the olde Testament, called <hi>septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginta,</hi> as false, because it differeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Hebrew. Where
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2866:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it is not onely different in wordes, but also contrary in sense, Why should we not? but if it reteine the sense and substance, although it expresse not the same wordes, we neede not reiect it. S. Hierom, who was required by Paula, and Eustochium, to expounde the Prophetes, not onely according to the truth of the Hebrew, but also af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the translation of the Septuaginta, whereof he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse tymes complayneth: vppon the first of Nahum, sayth expresly, that it was against his conscience alwaies, to follow the same. <q>
                              <hi>Ignoscite prolixitati, &amp;c.</hi> Pardon me that I am so long. For I can not, following both the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and the tropologie or doctrine of maners, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend both briefly: most of all, seeing that I am so great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye tormented, or troubled with the varietie of the translation, and against my conscience sometimes I am compelled to frame a consequence of the vulgar edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which was the Septuaginta. This was Sainct Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roms opinion of the Septuagintaes translation.</q> But vpon reiection of that translation (say you) it followeth that wheresoeuer those places, so disagreeing from the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue are cited by Christ, or the Euangelistes and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, there also they must be reiected, because they disagree from the Hebrue, and so the Greeke text of the newe Testament is not true, and consequentlye the wordes of our Sauiour, and writinges of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles speaking according to the Septuaginta, must at leaste bee reformed. It is an olde saying, and a true, that one inconuenience being graunted, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye doe followe, and so you may heape vp an hundred after this manner. But for aunswere I say, that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Sauiour, nor his Apostles, citing any place out of the olde Testament, doe bring any thing disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing in sense, and substance of matter (the purpose for which they alleage it considered) from the truth of the Hebrue text. Therefore there is no neede that the 70. in those places should be reiected. Althogh our Sauiour Christ speaking in the Syrian to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue, is not to be thoght

euer to haue cited the text of the 70. which is in Greeke. And his Apostles and Euangelists vsing that text, regard the substance of the sentence, &amp; not the forme of words. For many times they cite not the very wordes of the Greeke 70. neither: &amp; S. Hierom <hi>in Catalogo script: Eccles.</hi> which is set as a Preface to S.

Hierome, that their may be many reasons giuen for the difference of the one, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other: But concerning this place of S. Luke now in question, you say he giueth a reason therof, both for the 70. &amp; for the Euangelist that followed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neither doubting of the truth thereof, nor controlling them by the auctoritie of Moses. And for this you quote <hi>Comment. in</hi> 28. <hi>Esa.</hi> and <hi>in question.

It seemeth you redde not the bookes your selfe, but trusted to much some mans collectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode not. In the Preface to the Hebrue questions, Hieronime excuseth him selfe against enuious persons, that barked against him as though he did nothing but reproue the errors of the 70. saying. <q>That he thinketh not his labour to be a reprehension of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, seing they would not expresse vnto Ptolomaeus king of Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dria, certain mysticall thinges in the Scriptures, and especially those things which promised the comming of Christ, least the Iewes might haue bene thought to worship an other God, whom that follower of Plato therefore did greatly esteeme, because they were said to worship but one god. But the Euangelistes also, and our Lorde and Sauiour, and S. Paule the Apostle, bring foorth many thinges, as it were out of the old Testament, which are not had in in our bookes, of whiche in their due places wee will more fully discusse. Whereof it is cleare, that those are the more true examples, which agree with the auctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the newe Testament.</q> Thus much Hierom in that place: but neither in his questions vppon Genesis, nor 1. <hi>Paralip.</hi> the proper places for this texte, is their any mention of this place of Luke, <hi>Qui fuit Cainan.</hi> In the place cited by you vpon the 28. of Esay, hee sayth, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimus in Apostolo, &amp;c.</hi> We reade in the Apostle.

And this we haue obserued in the old Testament, except a few testimonies which only Luke vseth otherwise, whiche had knowledge of the Greeke tongue rather, wheresoeuer any thing is said out of the old Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that they set it not according to the 70. but according to the Hebrue, folowing the translatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but turning the sense of the Hebrue into their owne speach.</q> You see that Hierome saith nothing parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, &amp; that which he sayth generally, concerneth this place nothing at all. And very like it is, that this corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption was not crept into S. Lukes text in his tyme, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially seeing neyther S. Ambrose in his commentarie vpon S. Luke, once toucheth this controuersie, as hee doth all other questions about that Genealogie. Where you say S. Hierome was a great patrone of the Hebrue, not without cause, being at that time perhaps the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue veritie in deede. It is without perhaps, or perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, that not one iote, or pricke of the lawe of God can perishe, by the testimonie of our Sauiour Christe, <hi>Math.</hi> 5. And if you will beleeue <hi>Arias Montanus,</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent learned Papiste, he will tell you as much, out of the same text doubtles, in his Preface vnto the great Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by him set out, with diligent obseruation of all the Accents &amp; Hebrue points, which Christ (sayth he) will neuer suffer to perish.

the fraude and impulsion of the spirit of errour, some of the nation of the Iewes in times past were brought to that point of insolencie, or madnesse, that in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Christian church, they changed some words, which might altogither breake of that their contention of oppugning the Christian veritie: But those places so defiled by them, were very fewe, and in the bookes of our writers, and also in the copies, both printed &amp; writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the Iewes them selues, are all for the most partno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and shewed out. For although either by the fraude of those men, or by the ignorance of the booke writers, or by iniurie of the times, some change hath bene made in the Hebrew bookes, which we vse, yet is there not one word, nor one letter, nor point that is mentioned to haue bene of olde time, which is not found to haue bene safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept, in that moste riche treasurie, which they call the Mazzoreth. For in that, as in an holy and faithfull custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, appointed with vttermost diligence, and great study, the remnants, monuments, tokens, steppes, and examples of the auncient reading, are all conteined, and the way how to compare the olde and new reading is shewed: of which truely, being compared togither, a very certaine way is extant, to the prescript rule whereof, the holy my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries may be shewed forth, examples whereof some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in this worke, in due place, and else where also, with Gods helpe, we will set forth.</q> Thus farre Arias Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, whose iudgement if you say you are not bound to follow, yet I suppose you can yeelde no sufficient reason, why you should not credit his testimonie, concerning the certaintie of the Hebrew veritie, remaining to this daye, and which shall remaine to the worldes ende, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all the smatterers among you, would brast for spite against it.

controuersies, although the same reason is not of Moses compiling a certaine account of the time, from the floud to the calling of Abraham, and of Mathew, shewing by the legall discent, which euery man might take out of the bookes of Kinges and Chronicles, that Christ was the sonne of Dauid, and therefore he was not bound to the number of successors, seeing for memorie, it was his purpose to recite but thrise foureteene generations. That Beda maruaileth at the doubt, which he could not dissolue, his modestie is to be commended, rather than his knowledge. Neuerthelesse, the same Beda, in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face vnto his retractation vpon the Acts of the Apostles, speaking of such difference, as he founde in the Greeke text of the Actes, from the Latine, he saith: <q>
                              <hi>Quae vtrum negligentia interpretis omissa, &amp;c.</hi> Which things, whether they were omitted through negligence of the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or otherwise vttered, or for lack of regard of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters depraued, or otherwise left, as yet we coulde not know. For I dare not so much as suspect, that the Greeke copie was falsified: wherefore I admonish the Reader, that wheresoeuer we haue done these things, he reade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for his learning: yet that he interlace them not in his booke, as places corrected except perhaps he shal find the same in some Latine booke of a peculiar edition, to haue bene of olde so interpreted.</q> This place sheweth that in Bedes time, there were more Latine translatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s than one, &amp; that the vulgar Latine was not of such authoritie, but that it might be corrected by the Greeke, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of other auncient Latine translations. Likewise vpon the text in question, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>in Luc. cap.</hi> 3. he confesseth that the name &amp; generation of Cainan, according to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew verity, is found neither in Genesis, nor in the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles: saying that S. Luke tooke this generation from the edition of the Septuaginta. But whether is the truer, or whether both can be true, he leaueth it to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God. Noting that whereas according to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew verity, from the floud to the birth of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there

were but 292. yeares, the 70. make 1077. so that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is no lesse than of 785. yeares. But to fauour this fact of Beza, in putting out the name of Cainan, there is an auncient copie of the Gospels &amp; Actes in Greeke and Latine, of as great antiquitie by all likelihood, as any copie this day extant in Christendome, sent vnto the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersitie of Cambridge this laste yeare, by Beza him selfe, there to be kept in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon librarie, in which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, this generation of Cainan, both in the Greeke, &amp; in the Latine, is cleane left out, euen as Beza hath done in his translation. So that he hath not onely the authoritie of Moses, which of it selfe is sufficient, but also the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of this most au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient booke, both for the Greeke &amp; for the Latine, to approue his facte in putting out <hi>Qui fuit Cainan.</hi> What your vulgar latine translation hath left out in the later ende of the Lordes prayer in S.

And if the corruption be in one Bible, not in an other, commonly the sayd Bible or Bibles are noted in the margent: if not, yet sure it is, that it is in one of them, and so the Reader shall find it if he find it not alwaies in his owne Bible.

that hath it not so as we say. For it is their common and knowen fashion, not onely in their translations of the Bible, but in their other bookes and writings, to alter and change, adde &amp; put out, in their later editions, according as either them selues are ashamed of the former, or their scholers that print them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, dissent and disagree from their Maisters. So hath Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Caluins, and Bezaes writings and translations bene chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged both by them selues, and their scholers, in many places, so that Catholike men when they confute that which they find eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent faults in this or that edition, feare nothing more than that the Reader hath some other edition, where they are corrected for very shame, and so may conceiue that there is no such thing, but that they are accused wrongfully. For example. Call to minde the late pretended conference in the Tower, where that matter<note place="margin">Touching S.

                        <p>FVLK. 33. First this is vntrue, for some you haue noted in the new Testament, printed 1580. Secondly, it is vncertaine, for two of these translations might be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in one yeare, and so I thinke they were. Therefore I know not well which you meane, but I guesse that the Bible 1562. is that which was of Doctor Couerdales tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation, most vsed in the Church seruice in King Edwards time. The Bible 1577. I take to be that, which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised by diuerse Bishops, was first printed in the large volume, and authorized for the Churches, about tenne or twelue yeares agoe. That of 1579. I knowe not what translation it be, except it be the same that was first prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at Geneua, in the beginning of the Queenes Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Raigne. And this coniecture as the fittest I can make, I must followe, seeing your note of distinction, is as good, as that fond fellowes, that would know his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters horse by the bridle.</p>
                        <p>But it is a common and knowen fashion, you say, vsed of vs, that not onely in translations, but in other bookes and writings of ours, we alter and change, adde, and put

to in our later editions. And who vseth not so to doe, if by later cogitations, that often are wiser, he finde any thing meete to be changed? Doe not you Papistes vse the same? Is Bristowes chapter of obedience in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, nothing altered from the high treason contained in the first edition? Is nothing added, taken away, or changed in your Iesus Psalter, in any of your editions, or are you your selues ashamed of the former? Or haue your schollers presumed to alter their maisters writings? If you may haue an euasion in these cases, I trust we are not so pente in, but we may change our owne writings without shame of the former, or corruption in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. As for the example of S. Iames Epistle, denyed (as you saye) and faced out for Luthers credit, will serue you for no proofe. For so farre off is it, that we, or the world doe knowe, that is was moste truly layed to his charge: that nowe we knowe of a certaintie, that it was a very slaunder, as false, as it was common: seeing Luthers wordes of that Epistle, are not absolute, but in comparison, as is confessed by you, and founde by some of vs to be none otherwise in deede, who haue not stoode vpon one onely booke or edition, but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as many as they could come by, both in the Latine, and in the Dutch tongue.</p>

If their be no greater argument, as you confesse there can be none, that their auoyding of this vulgar Latine is wilfull and hereticall, than this, that Luther defended his mariage beyng a votarie, by that texte of 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 9. wherein the Apostle challengeth power to leade aboute with him a sister to wife, whiche your texte hath <hi>Mulierem sororem</hi> a woman a sister.

For although the mariage of ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall ministers generally is proued by that Scripture: yet the mariage of votaries specially, is nothing confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. And for the mariage of Bishops, Priestes and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, your owne translation of 1. Tim. 3. and Tit. 1. both Latine and English will warrant them to be the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes of one wife, so that euery childe may see, that he needed not for that purpose, to corrupt the texte, 1. Cor. 9. And as for the other texts, 2. Pet. 1. although this worde, (by good workes,) is not expressed in the moste Greeke copies, yet the whole circumstance of the place giueth it necessarily to be vnderstoode, and yet it maketh nothing agaynst iustification by fayth only. For our election which is most certaine &amp; immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in Gods determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is made certainly knowen vnto vs by good workes, the fruites of iustifying faith, euen as the effectes doe necessarily proue the cause gone before.

So true it is that you say, wee leaue it out, because wee holde the selfe same heresie: As likewise that you slaunder vs to hold, that good workes are not necessarie to saluation, whereas we beleeue that good workes are as necessarie to saluation, as fayth, in all them that are iustified by faith onely.

Mathew, or els it is an errour of the writers, placing that in the nominatiue case, which should be in the datiue. For in the datiue case did Basil read them in his morals, 21. definition.</p>
                        <p>Neuertheles, all our olde bookes (sayth Beza) had it so written, as it is commonly printed in the nominatiue case.

But the truth is, that since he wrote this, he found one more auncient copie, both in Greeke, and Latine, which nowe is at Cambridge, where this whole verse is wanting.

                        <p>For al these the Greeke Dictionaries do teach, that it signifieth.

This abusing of the word, tradition, might be a sufficient cause for the translators, to render the Greeke worde, where it is taken for such doctrine as is beside the commaundement of God, by the name of traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the worde is commonly taken. But where the Greeke worde is taken in the good parte, for that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which is agreeable with the holy Scriptures, they might with good reason auoide it, as you your selfe doe not alwayes translate <hi>tradere,</hi> to betray, but sometimes to deliuer. So did the translators giue these words, ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, instructions, institutions, or doctrine deliuered, which doe generally signifie the same that tradition, but haue not the preiudice of that partiall signification, in which the Papistes vse it, who wheresoeuer they find tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, straight way imagine they haue found a sufficient argument, against the perfection and sufficiencie of the holy Scripture, and to bring in all riffe raffe, and trishe trashe, of mans doctrine, not onely beside, but also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye to the manifest worde of God, conteined in his most holy and perfect Scriptures.

                        <p>Nowe to aunswer you why <hi>Ecclesia</hi> was first transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted congregation, and afterward Church: the reason that moued the firste translators (I thinke) was this: the worde Churche of the common people, at that tyme, was vsed ambiguously, both for the assemblie of the faythfull, and for the place in which they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled: for auoyding of which ambiguitie, they

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2866:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but for satisfying of the simple and ignoraunt. Howe this my saying, differeth from your slaunderous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte, I trust euery reasonable Papist that will take paines to conferre them togither, will be enforced to acknowledge. For where I say shamelesse translations and wilfull corruptions (as Howlet chargeth vs,) you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte me to saye mistranslated, although in playne wordes I did confesse, that there might be some er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours euen in the best and perfectest of our translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For to translate out of one tongue into an other, is a matter of greater difficultie than it is commonly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, I meane exactly to yeeld as much and no more, than the originall containeth, when the wordes and phrases are so different, that fewe are found<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which in all pointes signifie the same thing, neither more nor lesse in diuers tongues.

Now if some of our translators, or they all, haue not attained to the best, and most proper expressing of the nature of all wordes and phrases of the Hebrew and Greeke tongues in English, it is not the matter that I will stande to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende, nor the translators them selues, I am well assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if they were all liuing. But that the Scriptures are not impudently falsified, or willfully corrupted by them, to mayntayne anie hereticall opinion, as the aduersarie chargeth vs, that is the thing, that I will (by Gods grace) stande to defende, against all the Papistes in the worlde.

if they were too long. So if our sayings be too short for your purpose, you straine them to be longer, if they be too long, you cut of their shankes, yea that which is worse, the very head, as you play with me in this place. I my selfe, and so did many hundreds beside me, heare that reuerend father M. Doctor Couerdale of holy and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned memorie, in a sermon at Paules crosse, vpon occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of some slaunderous reportes, that then were raysed againste his translation, declare his faithfull purpose in doing the same, which after it was finished, and presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to King Henry the eight, of famous memorie, and by him committed to diuerse bishops of that time to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vse, of which (as I remember) Steuen Gardiner was one: after they had kept it long in their handes, and the King was diuerse times sued vnto for the publication thereof, at the last being called for by the King him selfe, they redeliuered the booke: and being demaunded by the King what was their iudgement of the translation, they aunswered that there were many faultes therein. Well said the King, but are there anye heresies maintayned thereby: They answered there was no heresies that they could finde, maintained thereby. If there be no heresies sayd the King, then in Gods name let it goe abroad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our people. According to this iudgement of the King and the Bishops, M. Couerdale defended his tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation, confessing that he did now him selfe espie some faultes, which if he might reuiew it once ouer againe, as he had done twise before, he doubted not but to amend: but for any heresie, he was sure there was none maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his translation. After the same maner, I doubt not (by Gods helpe) so to defende all our translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for all your euident markes to know wilful corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that not one shal bee founde of purpose to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine any hereticall opinion, and not many errours committed through negligence, ignorance, or humaine frailtie.</p>

Also vpon the 45. <hi>Psalme.</hi> God was high in the Patriarches and Prophetes, which did not compare him <hi>Imaginibus terrenis &amp; simulachris scrupeis,</hi> to images or similitudes of the earth and stone. Tertullian also, a Latine writer, in his booke <hi>De specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culis,</hi> speaking of cunning workemanship of Imagery, shewed in those playes, and the auctors of them, sayeth: <hi>Scimus enim nihil esse nomina mortuorum, sicut nec ipsa simu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachra eorum.</hi> We know that the names of those dead me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are nothing, as also their images. Afterwarde to their names <hi>Nominibus</hi> he ioyneth <hi>Imaginibus,</hi> to shew that <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulachra</hi> and <hi>Imagines</hi> are all one, which of Christians at that time were greatly abhorred, in detestation of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie. S. Augustine calleth the same <hi>Simulachra</hi> which before he called <hi>Imagines. Cùm ex desiderio mortuorum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituerentur Imagines, vnde simulachrorum vsus exortus est.</hi> When for desire of the dead, Images were made, wherof the vse of Images came, through flatterie, diuine honor was giuen vnto them: and so they brought in idolatrie or the worshipping of images. The same Augustine in his booke <hi>Octaginta Quaestion.</hi> in the 78. <hi>quaest.</hi> which is intituled <hi>De simulachrorum pulchritudine,</hi> of the bewtie of Images, ascribeth to God, the cunning, by which they are made bewtifull.

                              <hi>id est cuiuspiam dei falsi &amp; alieni simulachrum.</hi> When it was no Idoll, that is to say, an Image of some false or straunge God. Againe he sayth, those things that were commaunded to be made in the tabernacle, were rather referred to the worship of God, than that any thing of them should be taken for God, or for an image of God, <hi>pro Dei simulachro.</hi> So that <hi>Simulachrum</hi> with S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine, signifieth as generally, as Image, and can not be restrayned to signifie an Idoll, in the euill parte, except you adde, that it is an image of a false or straunge God. Arnobius an ecclesiasticall writer of the Latine Church vseth the worde <hi>Simulachrum</hi> for an image generally: calling man also <hi>simulachrum Dei,</hi> as Lactantius doth the image of God, <hi>Cont. gent. lib.</hi> 8. <hi>Putatis autem nos occulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re quod colimus si delubra &amp; aras non habemus. Quod enim simulachrum Deo fingam, cùm si rectè existimes sit Dei ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo ipse simulachrum.</hi> Thinke you that we do hide that which we worship, if we haue no temples, and aultars. For what image shall I fayne to God, whereas if you iudge rightly, man him selfe is the image of God. You see therefore that <hi>Simulachrum</hi> signifieth not an Idoll worshipped for God, but euen as much as <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mago,</hi> by your owne rule. Laste of all, for I will not trouble the Reader with more, although more might be brought. Isidorus Hispalensis an auncient Bishop of the Latine Churche, <hi>Originum lib.</hi> 8. speaking of the firste inuentors of Images, whiche after were abused to Idolatrie, sayeth: <hi>Fuerunt etiam &amp; quidam viri for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes aut vrbium conditores: quibus mortuis homines qui eos dilexerunt, simulachra finxerunt, vt haberent aliquod ex imaginum contemplatione solatium: sed paulatim hunc er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorem &amp;c.</hi> There were also certayne Valiaunt menne or buylders of Cities, who when they were dead, men which loued them, made their images or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaites, that they might haue some comforte in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the images: but by little and little the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilles perswading this errour, it is certayne that so it
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2866:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
crepte into their posteritie, that those whome they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored, for the onely remembraunce of their name, their successours esteemed and worshipped as gods. Agayne he sayeth, <hi>Simulachra autem à similitudine nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupata, &amp;c.</hi> Images are called <hi>Simulachra</hi> of the simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, because by the hande of the artificers, of stone, or other matter they resemble the countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of them, in whose honor they are fayned. Or they are called <hi>à Simulando,</hi> whereof it followeth, they are false things. These testimonies needed not, for them that be but halfe learned, whiche knowe right well, that <hi>Simula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrum</hi> is <hi>Synonomon</hi> with <hi>Imago:</hi> but that our aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are so impudent, that to serue their idolatrous affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, they care not what Idolles they inuent, of wordes, of significations, of distinctions, so they maye seeme to saie somewhat in the eares of the vnlearned, which are not able to iudge of such matters. But perhappes they will saie, their vulgar Latine interpreter vseth the worde <hi>Simulachrum,</hi> onely for Idols, that are worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with diuine honor. Neyther is that true, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were, seing it seldome vseth <hi>Simulachra,</hi> and most commonly <hi>Idola,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Imagines,</hi> what reason is their why we may not call those things Images which your Interpreter calleth <hi>Simulachra?</hi> And to proue that your interpreter vseth <hi>Simulachrum</hi> for an image generally, as all other Latine writers doe, you may see 1. <hi>Sam. cap.</hi> 19. where speaking of the image which Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chol layed in the bedde, to counterfaite the sicknesse of Dauid, firste he calleth it <hi>Statuam,</hi> and afterwarde the same image he calleth <hi>Simulachrum.</hi> And sure it is, that Dauid had no idolles in his house.

Therfore the vulgar Latine Interpreter, peruerteth the words, &amp; saith: <hi>Mulie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem sororem.</hi> It is true, that many of the auncient fathers, as too much addict to the singlenes of the Clergie, though they did not altogither condemne mariage in them, as the Papists doe: did expound the sister whereof S.

Secondly this word <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap> were needeles, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it should signifie a wife: for the word sister signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth both a woman, &amp; a faithful woman, and otherwise it was not to be doubted, least the Apostle would leade a heathen woman with him. Thirdly the Apostle speaketh of one woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; not many, wheras there were many that followed our Sauiour Christ, whereas one alone to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Apostle, might breede occasion of ill suspition, and offence, which many could not so easily. Fourthly, those that are mentioned in the Gospell, our Sauiour Christ did not leade about, but they did voluntarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him: but the Apostle here saith, that he had authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as the rest of the Apostles, to leade about a woman, which argueth the right, that an husband hath ouer his wife, or of a maister ouer his maide. Fiftly, it is not all one, if women could trauel out of <hi>Galilie</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which was nothing neare an hundred miles; that women could followe the Apostles into all partes of the world.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2866:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Sixtly, if the cause why such women are supposed to haue followed the Apostles, was to minister to them of their substance, the leading them about, was not burdenous to the Church, but helpeful: but the Apostle testifieth, that he forbare to vse this libertie, because he would not be burdenous to the Church of Corinth, or to any of them. Seuenthly, seing it is certaine that Peter had a wife, and the rest of the Apostles are by antiquitie reputed to haue bene all maried: It is not credible that Peter, or any of the rest, would leaue the companie of their owne wiues, &amp; leade strange women about with them. As for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection that you make in your note vppon the text, to what ende should he talke of burdening the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans with finding his wife, when he himself cleerely saith, that he was single? I answer, Although I thinke he was single, yet is it not so cleere as you make it, for <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> thinketh he had a wife, which he left at <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi,</hi> by mutual consent. But albeit he were single, it was lawfull for him to haue maried, and <hi>Barnabas</hi> also, as wel as all the rest of the Apostles. Againe, to what end should he talke of burdening the Church with a woman, which was not his wife, when such women as you say ministred to the Apostles of their goods? Wherby it should follow that none of the Apostles burdened the Churches where they preached with their owne finding, which is cleane contrary to the Apostles wordes and meaning. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the translation of <hi>Beza,</hi> and of our Church, is most true, and free from all corruption.</p>

The Verse by you quoted <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 18. is a manifest <hi>eclipsis</hi> or defectiue speach, to make any sense, wherof, there must needes be added a Nominatiue case, and a Verbe.

Iames saieth no: we say, no also, neyther can it be proued that we adde this word only to the text in any translation of oures. If Luther did in his transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion adde the worde only to the texte, it can not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused of wrong translation in worde, although the sense might well beare it.

Because our English Protestants honour him as their father.

But that the later end of the verse can not be referred to sinne, but vnto Cain, not only the Grammar, but also the plaine wordes, and sense of the place doth conuince.

Why then the sense is this. This bloud in the cuppe which is shed for you, is the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in my bloud. What sense in the worlde can these wordes haue? By which it is manifest, that the words</hi> which is shed for you, <hi>cannot be referred to the cuppe, but to his bloud.

Ceremoniall, and Iudiciall, so the Hebrewes haue three seuerall words, to expresse the seueral precepts of those lawes. For the Hebrew word which signifieth the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall precepts, the Greekes vse to translate <gap reason="foreign">

for the ecclesiasticall vse of wordes in the Scripture, and the Fathers, which Beza (you say) doth for the most part reiect, it is vntrue: except there be good and sufficient cause, why he should so do, warranted by the Scripture it selfe, or necessarie circumstances of the places, which he doth translate. For if the Scripture haue vsed a worde in one signification sometimes, it is not necessarie that it should alwaies vse it in the same signification, when it is proued by auncient writers that the worde hath other significations, more proper to the place, and agreeable to the rule of fayth, which perhaps the vsuall significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not.

Such matters of ceremonies, order, &amp; disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, which are mutable, no man denies, but they might &amp; did deliuer, but yet in them nothing but agreeable to the generall rules set downe in the Scripture.

some decree of the Synode, or Act of Parliament against it, and sayth: it may be and is suffered in that sense, which the holy Ghost vseth it, but not to bring prayer for the deade, or any thing contrarie to the Scripture vnder the name of traditions Apostolike. By which wordes I meane, that there is no prohibition or edict to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, but if any man will vse the worde tradition in translation of the Bible, he is permitted so to doe, I doe not affirme it is so founde.

Wherefore if you should expresly adde the worde tradition in your partiall signification, wheresoeuer you finde the word deliuered, you shoulde not onely translate ridiculously, but also heretically and falsly.

We follow not therefore the Latine translation, but ioyne with it wheresoeuer it followeth the Greeke, as we doe in ten thousand places more than

this, and willingly depart not from it, but where it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth from the Greeke, or else vseth such wordes as would be offensiue, if they were translated into English, or occasion of errour, as you doe likewise, when you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the proper and vsuall signification of wordes, which your Latine translator vseth: as when you call <hi>foenerator,</hi> a creditor, which signifieth an vsurer, <hi>Luc.</hi> 7. <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulum,</hi> an Inne, and <hi>stabularius,</hi> an host, <hi>Luc.</hi> 10. <hi>Vna Saba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thi,</hi> the first of the Sabaoth, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2. <hi>Ecclesia,</hi> the assembly, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. <hi>Baptismata,</hi> washings, <hi>Marc.</hi> 7. and such like. But we in England (you say) condemne the Latine translation, as papisticall. We accuse it as not true, in many places, &amp; we saye it is the worst of all, though Beza, our maister, pronounce it to be the very beste. This toucheth me somewhat, for in the margent is noted Discouerie of the Rocke, <hi>pag.</hi> 147. where in deede speaking of the Hebrew text, of the olde Testament, and the Greeke of the newe, the Greeke translation of the Septuaginta, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Latine translation, I saye the Tridentine Councell alloweth none for authenticall, but the common Latine translation, that is, the worst of all. Now what sayth Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za contrary to this? speaking of the diuerse Latine tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations of the new Testament onely, he sayth of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Latine, that he followeth it for the most part, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth it before all the rest, <hi>maxima ex parte amplector &amp; caeteris omnibus antepono.</hi> So that I speake of the whole Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Beza of the new Testament only.

Now to our English phrase, a riche man maketh his money his God, a glutton his bellie, and so of other creatures honoured aboue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. I say the worshipping of images may be after two sortes, either when they are worshipped as gods, (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the grosser sort of the Gentils &amp; Papistes) &amp; then it is against the first commaundement. Thou shalt haue none other gods but me: or else when men pretende to worshippe God by them, as the Israelites did in the calfe <hi>Ex.</hi> 32. &amp; in Ieroboams calues, &amp; in the brasen serpent, &amp;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:2866:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the wiser sort of the Gentils and Papists pretend to do in worshipping their images: &amp; then it is a sinne against the second co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement. Thou shalt make to thy selfe no grauen images. Thou shalt not fall downe to them nor worship the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. By similitude therfore of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that trusted in images as their gods, &amp; so honored the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which were not able to helpe them, the Apostle calleth the couetous man a worshipper of images, &amp; couetousnes worshipping of images: &amp; not properly: but because their monie is to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the same occasion of departing from God, that the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges was to the worshipper of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So if we will speake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, as the Apostle saith, their belly is their God, we may say, it is their idoll, or their image, which they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship as God: not that the belly, or any such thing is God, or an idol, or an image properly, but that it is so termed, for that to such vile creatures, is giuen that diuine honor, which is due to God: but by worshippers of idols, and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, is giuen to idols or images. I confesse the vse of the English tongue in these speaches, is rather to call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> idols, than images, and to extend the name idol (which is alwaies taken in the euill parte) to that which the word i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage can not so aptly signifie: yet in trueth of the thing there is no difference betwene idol and image, worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of idols, and worshipping of images, whether you speake of such as be idols &amp; images so properly called, or of such as be onely by similitude, figuratiuely so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. If any of our Superintende<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts be such as you speake of, I wish them amended or else remoued. For my parte I know none to be suche, although I wish to the best, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Gods grace, to despise the world, &amp; to be more earnest in setting foorth Gods glorie. As for the great difference you speake of, betwixt S. Paules wordes, and our translation, I see none as yet.</p>

You are so cunning in Satans cogitations, that he hath inspired into you a manifest vntrueth: for this text was so translated, &amp; printed nere 30. yeres before 1562. in King Henrie the eightes time, when images were not in plucking downe. And when it was printed againe 1562. which was the fifth yere of her Maiesties reigne (God be tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ked) there was no neede to plucke downe images out of churches, which were pluckt downe in the first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yeres of her reigne.

you say that the Apostle alludeth to Salomons temple, which did well agree with images, but not with idols: I answere you, Salomons te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple did not agree with images made by the deuise of man, to honour God by them, or in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

when it was worshipped, and therefore iustly broken in peeces, by the godly king Ezechias. You cite Augustine as it pleaseth you, to followe your owne context. <hi>Quem sanè serpentem propter facti memoriam reseruatum, cum posteà populus errans, tanquam idolum colere cepisset Ezechias, &amp;c.</hi> Which serpent truly being reserued for the memorie of the fact, when afterward the people going astray, began to worship as an idoll, Ezechias the king, seruing God with religious power, with great praise of his pietie, brake in peeces. Here it is certaine, that Augustine as most Ecclesiasticall writers, vseth the word <hi>Idolum,</hi> for an image abused. But that the people began to adore it as God, he sayth not, for they onely worshipped God by it, falsly in deede, and superstitiously: but yet not beleuing that image to be God him selfe, but a holy representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his power, which was shewed by it in the dayes of Moses. That Ezechias by religious or Ecclesiasticall power and authoritie, did put downe idolatrie you passe it by, as though you saw it not in S. Augustine. But you bring an other example to proue, that images except they be worshipped as gods, be no idols. In truth, seeing all religious worship is due onely to God, although the idolaters intend not to worship their images as gods, yet by worshipping of them, they make vnto them selues gods of them, and so offende both against the first, and second commaundementes. Yet how proue you, that the Israelites made a god of their calfe. Because they sayed these are thy gods, ô Israel, that brought thee out of the land of Aegipt. But euen by that same speach it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that they worshipped not the calfe, as beleuing it to be God: but contrariwise protested thereby, that they meaned not to chaunge their God, but to worshippe the same God, which brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the land of Aegipt by that image, which they could not be ignorant that it was made but yesterday, of their earings, and therefore could not thinke it was the same god that brought them out of the lande of Aegipt, but that they would worship
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:2866:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God by that visible shape, which they sawe before them. And Aaron by his proclamation co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmeth the same. To morow, (saith he) shal be holy daie to <hi>Iehoua,</hi> that is, to the only true God, whom they dishonored, pretending to worship him by that Image: so hainous a thing it is, to make Images to represent God, and to worship them for his honour, although the worshipper do not beleeue them to be Gods. Therefore where wee haue in some translations, 1. Cor. 10. called those Idolaters worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Images, we haue not erred: for an Image it was they worshipped, thinking to worshippe God thereby.

Likewise the Romanes tooke away the name of Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lius for the crime of one Manlius, not for the crime of Iohn at Nokes, or of any other name.

When the image of Iupiter, King of Creete, was first made, and nothing else done vnto it, would you call it an image, or an idoll.

                              <hi>Tyranni,</hi> though the name it self first signified not so, that name of tyrant became odious. As for your fombli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Manlius, and Iudas, two proper names, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with image, and idoll, King, and Tyrant, which be common names, I will not vouchsafe to answer them. But the name of ministers (you saye) is odious, for the faults of ministers, and not for the faults of priestes. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish priestes are odious enough, for their owne faults, so that they neede not be charged vniustly, with the faultes of our euill ministers. Which, I would wish, were fewer, than they be, but I trust there are not so many euill of them, as your popish priestes haue bene, and are dayly found to be. And whosoeuer of our ministers hath bene found worst, I thinke there may be found, not a priest, but a Pope of your side, as euill, or worse than he. But if reuerence done by Papistes, (which you call Christians) to images, had bene euill, (say you,) it should haue made the name of images, odious also. No sir, that followeth not, so long as that reuerence was accounted good, and lawfull, and now that it is found to be abhominable, the people hauing the other odious worde of idolls, in vse, neede not abandon the name of images, except they had an other, to signifie lawfull, and good images.

Therefore it is not my fond opinion, but. M. Martines foolish collection, that a

                           <p>But nowe you will returne to those wordes of myne, where I say, that though the originall proprietie of the wordes, hath that signification: yet, no Christian man would say, that God made man according to his idoll, no more than a good subiect woulde call his lawefull Prince, a tyrant. These wordes (you say) doe tell vs, that we may not speake, or translate, according to the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall proprietie of the word, but according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, vsual, and accustomed signification thereof. For speaking I graunt, as the words are vsed in our time: but for translating, I saye you must regarde howe the wordes were vsed in time of the writer, whose workes you tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate. As if you would translate out of Euripides, <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>, would you translate, Iupiter, tyrant of the gods, or King of the gods? I thinke not. But in S. Iohn, seeing at that tyme that he wrote, <gap reason="foreign">

But now you set vpon vs with 13. Hebrue wordes, and 9. Greeke words at ones, which we for the most parte doe translate still Images, Images: and you say we sounde with Cuckowes birdes continually Images, Images, more than Idols or other wordes equiualent to Idols. How many times the word Image is sounded, I neuer had care to seeke, and now I haue no leysure to number, but I am sure Idols and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie, in that translation in which least, are named a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue fortie or fiftie times.

That wee haue no greater chaunge of wordes to answere so many of the Hebrue tongue, it is of the riches of that tongue, and the pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our mother language, which hath but two wordes, <hi>Image,</hi> and <hi>Idoll,</hi> and them both borowed of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine and Greeke: As for other wordes equiualent, wee know not any, and we are loth to make any new wordes of that signification, excepte the multitude of Hebrue words of the same sense co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming togither, do sometimes perhaps seeme to require it. Therfore as the Greeke hath fewer wordes to expresse this thing than the Hebrue, so hath the Latine fewer than the Greeke, and the English fewest of all, as will appeare if you would vndertake to giue vs English wordes for the 13.

Alacke this is poore sophistrie, when all the worlde of Hebricians know, they are Hebrue for nothing else, but for grauen or cast images, and by the figure Synecdoche, are taken generally for images of what making or matter soeuer they be.

I haue tolde you that the sense of Chrysostome is true, but not flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing easily from the wordes of S. Paule.

To take away the holy sacrifice of the Masse, they take away both altar and Priest, because they know right well that these three (Priest, sacrifice, and altar) are depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes and consequentes one of an other, so that they can not be separated. If there be an externall sacrifice, there must be an external Priesthoode to offer it, an altar to offer the same vpon. So had the Gentiles their sacrifices, Priestes, and altars: so had the Iewes: so Christ him selfe being a Priest according to the order of Melchisedec, had a sacrifice, his bodie: and an altar, his Crosse, vpon the which he offered it. And because he insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted this sacrifice to continue in his Church for euer, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration and representation of his death, therefore did he withall ordaine his Apostles Priests at his last supper, there &amp; then instituted the holy order of Priesthoode and Priestes (saying, <hi>hoc faecite, Do this:</hi>) to offer the selfe same sacrifice<note place="margin">Luc. c. 22. v. 19.</note> in a mysticall and vnblouddie maner, vntill the worldes end.</p>

And to tell you plainely, as our conscience beareth vs witnesse, we will neuer dissemble, that we auoyde that worde Priest, as it is vsed to signifie a sacrificer, because we would shew a perfect distinction, betwene the priesthood of the lawe, and the ministerye of the Gospell: betwene <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdos,</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> a sacrificer, and a gouernor of the Church. And I appeale to your owne conscience, whether if the Englishe worde Priest, were as indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent as <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and sounded no more towardes a sacrifice, than either <hi>Presbyter,</hi> or your owne En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishe wordes, Auncient, and Senior, whether (I saye) you woulde make so muche a doe about it, for to haue it in all places of the Newe Testament, where <gap reason="foreign">

For the soule of Lazarus was not carried by the Angells into hell, but into Abrahams bosome, which was not onely a place of rest, but also of ioy, and comfort, contrarie to tormentes: betwene which and hell, was an infinite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce.

But that he should descend into <hi>Limbus patrum,</hi> to fetche out the fathers, which before you sayd were in prison, nowe you say in rest, we neither say it in our Creede, neither doth it pertaine vnto vs. But Hierome is cited as a fauourer of your opinion, who, I confesse in some parte held as you doe, but not altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

the same ground, that he neuer findeth in the Scriptures hell, taken in good parte, and <hi>cap.</hi> 34. where he proueth that paradise is heauen, he sayth: <q>

Tertullian in the booke by you quoted, <hi>pag.</hi> 274 of Frob. printed 1550 thus writeth. <q>
                                 <hi>Sed Marcion ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orsum cogit, &amp;c.</hi> But Marcion driueth it another way, so forsooth, that he determineth both the rewardes of the Creator, either of torment, or of refreshing, to be layd vp for them in hel, which haue obeyed the law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. But of Christ, and his God, he defineth an heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bosome, and heauen. We will answer and euen by this selfe same Scripture, conuincing his blindnesse, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst hel discerneth this Abrahams bosom, to the poore man. For one thing is hell, (as I thinke) and Abrahams bosome, an other thing. For a great depth he saith, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene those regions, and that doth let the passage to and fro. But neither should the riche man haue lifted vp his eyes, and that truely from a farre of, but into higher pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and that of an exceeding height, by that infinite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of height and depth. Whereof it appeareth to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wise man, that hath euer heard of the Elysian fieldes, that there is some locall determination, which is called Abrahams bosome, to receiue the soules of his sonnes, euen of the Gentiles, he being the father of many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to be accounted of Abrahams familie, and of the same faith, by which Abraham beleeued God, vnder no yoke of the lawe, nor in the signe of circumcision. That region therefore I call the bosome of Abraham, and if not heauenly, yet higher than hel, which shall giue rest in the meane season, to the soules of the iust, vntill the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation of thinges doe finish the resurrection of all, with the fulnesse of reward. This is as much as I can find in Tertullian,</q> touching Abrahams bosome, which is
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:2866:158" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cleane contrarie to that you affirme him to speake. For by this saying it is manifest, that your opinion is Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions heresie. Secondly, that Abrahams bosome is not hell, but higher by an infinite distance, although not in full perfection of heauenly glorie. Thirdly, that it is not <hi>Limbus patrum,</hi> but the receptacle of all the iust soules, to the ende of the worlde. Tertullians authoritie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth you small pleasure, and lesse honestie, vnlesse you did cite him more truely. But I am vnwise to looke for plaine dealing, and sinceritie, at your handes. Well, your <hi>Limbus patrum,</hi> the very brimme, or vppermost, or outmost part of hell, wherein all the Patriarches should rest, we haue now found from whence it came, euen from your olde acquaintance, the Mouse of Pontus, Marcion the abhominable Heretike. The other saying of Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, but that the opinion of the fathers in hell, had by that time taken some strength, might be vnderstood of the mortalitie, wherevnto they were subiect, and neuer shoulde haue bene raysed, but by the resurrection of Christ, as it seemeth by that which he opposeth of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, since the passion and resurrection of Christ, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to speake like Philosophers, of the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie of the soule, and reioycing in the resurrection of the dead, as the fathers mourned at their death. Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms place is more apparant for your errour, although he also may be vnderstood to speake allegorically of the effect of Christs death and resurrection, by which all the Patriarches were deliuered from death, and hell was spoyled: not that they were in prison there, but that the iustice of God had condemned them thether, if Christes death had not redeemed them: but I will not stande to cleare Chrysostome of this errour, which it is sufficient for me to haue fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that Marcion the old Heretike, was the firste author thereof, by Tertullians confession, howsoeuer it came to passe, that many good men after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward deceiued by the words <gap reason="foreign">

Howe can you vnderstand him to speake of hel? For the graue and not hell is a place for dead mens bones: as he speaketh of the faithfull, by the wicked compted as good as dead &amp; rotten, consumed to the bones.

Verily I can not see, nor any wise man else, I thinke, what this English worde, worthines, doth signifie, but a comparison of equalitie in price, valour, goodnes, excellencie, or such like. And euen in those En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish phrases, that you bring for example: Good works
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:2866:183" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are not worthie of heauen, the meaning is. There is not an equalitie of excellencie in good workes and heauen: or good workes compared to heauen, are not equall in valure. And euen so: this man is not worthie of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour. The goodnesse of this man, is not so great, as the goodnesse of my fauour. And so of the rest. And where you say, euerie English man vnderstandeth it thus: that they deserue not heauen, and suche a man deserueth not this, &amp;c. I graunt they may of worthinesse gather desert, in such as may deserue, and so may they of the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of equalitie, conclude desert in the like case. For to deserue, is by doing, to make him selfe equall in good or euill to that rewarde, or punishment which is valued with such doing. Therefore whether you say worthie, or equall, it is all one. And in this text<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by either of both, merite or desert is necessarily excluded. For if the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly glorie be inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parably greater, than the afflictions of this life, it followeth of necessitie, that the afflictions of this life deserue not, that is, make not an equalitie of excellencie with heauenly glorie. But the Greeke phrase (you say) is otherwise, for <gap reason="foreign">

Now our Englishe phrase would not beare, that we should say, worthie to the glory, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we said worthie of the glory. But if that were good, you say, the Greeke phrases were all one, and might be vsed indifferently. I see no great difference betwene the Greeke phrases, and yet it followeth not, that they may be vsed indifferently. For vnusuall phrases are not to be vsed as indifferently, as common phrases. And therefore your example of turning English into Greeke, is not all one, with turning Greeke into English. If I translate our of Greeke into Englishe, I must obserue the Englishe phrase, as neare as I can, and so if I translate into Greeke,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:2866:184" rendition="simple:additions"/>

To your seconde argument, I aunswere, that though the afflictions that Christ our Sauiour suffered, were not comparable in respect of the length of time, with the eternall glorie that he obtayned thereby: yet in respecte of the excellencie of his person, and the perfection of his obedience, they were comparable, and of equall value tó deserue eternall glorie according to the iustice of God, by which one mans disobedience was sufficient, to eternall condemnation, Rom. 5. What the least of his afflictions, separated from all the rest, was in valure, I haue not learned out of the Scripture, onely I thinke, he suffered nothing superfluously, <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>nor lesse than was needefull to aunswer the iustice of God. Your other fonde surmises, I omitte, vntill you expresse them. To your third argument, I saye, that one acte of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie is worthy of damnation, and deserueth eternall torment, not by comparison of the short pleasure, with infinite paine: but because it is a sinne committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the maiestie of the eternall God: and therefore is worthy of eternall punishment. For the sinne is to be measured after the excellencie of the person, against whome it is committed. Therefore that word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing spoken against a poore man, is a light fault, as to say he is a knaue, the same being spoken against a Lorde, is
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:2866:186" rendition="simple:additions"/>
an hainous offence, and deserueth the pillorie, hut be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing spoken against a King, is high treason, and is worthy of death. Seeing therefore the eternall maiestie of God is contemned in euery sinne, that sinne doth iustly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue eternall torments. Fourthly, it is true, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle doth exhort vs cheerefully to abide the small and momentarie afflictions of this life, in respect that they shall be rewarded with incomparable glorie. But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it followeth not, that the glorie is deserued, by short and small sufferings, but is giuen of the bountifull libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie of God, to them that for his sake patiently suffer such small afflictions. Therefore, if it be an incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a man to labour, to heare that he shall be payd his hyre, as much as his worke deserueth: it is a much greater incouragement for him to heare, that he shal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a thousand times more, than his labour deserueth. The words you adde, (you are neuer the nearer heauen, onely beleeue) are yours, and none of ours: for we say with the Apostle, we must suffer with Christ, if we will reigne with him, and the patient suffering of the faithful, is nothing repugnant to the iustification before God, by faith onely. To the last argument of the Apostles autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, I aunswer, our patient suffering worketh infinite weight of glorie, not by the worthinesse, merite, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert of our suffering, but by the bountifull liberalitie of God, who hath promised so incomparable rewarde, to small tribulation, suffered for his sake. Wherefore all your fiue reasons notwithstanding, our translation is sounde and true.</p>

The Lambe, that was killed, is worthye to receiue power, and riches, though we will not contende of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts of Christ, yet we may be bold to say, that in respect of the godhead, he was worthy of all honour and glorie from euerlasting, before he had created any thing: and therefore worthines doth not alway import desert, as no worthines doth no desert. Likewise, when it is said of the wicked, Apoc. 16. they are worthy to drinke bloud, it is true, that they deserued that plague, because their cruell workes were iustly recompensed with that punishment: but yet some may be worthy of their punishment, that haue not deserued it. The sonne of a traytor, is worthy to beare the punishment of his fathers attainder; yet he hath not alwayes deserued it by his owne deedes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not all one: they are worthy, and they haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued.

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where it is sayd of the elect, They shall walke with me in white, because they are worthy, it is not meant, that they haue deserued by their owne workes, to walke with Christ: but because they are made worthye by Christ, who hath giuen them grace, not to defile their garments, who also shall giue them the rewarde of white garments, that is, of innocencie, which no man can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue, because no man is cleare from sinne, but onely by forgiuenes of sinnes, in the bloud of Christ.

but inspired him also with diuine knowledge, by reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, without studie or hearing of other men: which gaue him also strength to ouercome so many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that no labour, nor trauaile, nor persecution, nor continuance of time, did make him weary, or faint in his labour.

                           <p>FVLK. 3. Concerning the omission of the Greeke article, which Caluine and Beza reproue in the olde tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slator, you make many wordes to no purpose: for they reproue him not for omitting it, where either it can not, or it neede not be expressed, but in this place, where both it may, and meete it is, that it should be expressed. But we (you say) to expresse the article, doe adde more than is in the text: yet in truth we adde nothing, but that which is necessarily to be vnderstoode, as when wee say Iames the sonne of Zebedee, where you had rather say Iames of Zebedee, as though you were so precise, that for necessarie vnderstanding, you would not adde a word to the text, &amp; yet you do verie often, yea sometimes where no neede is. As Act. 8. where the Latine is <hi>Curauerunt Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanum,</hi> you translate it, they tooke order for Stephans funerall.

                              </gap>. In the other place 1. Iohn. 2. v. 2. the worde sinnes, muste needes be vnderstoode in the pronoune adiectiue ours. In the thirde texte, where you accuse the transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of hereticall purpose, the sense is all one, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you adde the article or no. For when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle sayeth, by Christe we haue boldnesse and entrance with confidence, by faith, howe can you vnderstand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence by workes, and whether there be confidence by workes or no, there can none be proued by this place. Where Beza vnderstandeth an article, Rom. 8. whom our English translation doth follow, it is only to make that plaine, which otherwise is necessarily to be vnderstoode. For there is no differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwene these sayings. The law of the spirit of life in Christ Iesus, &amp; this, The lawe of the spirit of life which is in Christ Iesus, hath deliuered me from the lawe of sinne and death. The article or relatiue therefore declareth no more, but that the lawe of the spirit of life, is in Christ Iesus, which deliuereth vs. For both the text sayth, in Christ Iesus, and it can not be in any other to deliuer vs. For he sayeth not, The lawe of the spirite of life in vs, but in Christe Iesus, and the nexte verse following doeth manifestly confirme the same, as euerie man may see that will consider it. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Iames the seconde, wilt thou knowe O thou vaine man, that faith without workes is deade? If you say, the faith which is without good workes is deade, is not that the meaning of the Apostle? Where he addeth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, that Abraham was iustified by such a faith, as was fruitefull of good workes. And when he bringeth example of Deuils faith, is it not manifest he speaketh of suche a faith, as is vtterly voyde of all good workes? Where you say that Beza putteth the article into the text, and translateth it accordingly, you do most shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully belye him. For to the original text, he addeth none of his owne collection, but in his translation onely,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:2866:203"/>
where he iudgeth that according to the sense of the place, it must of necessitie be vnderstood: which if it be a fault in articles, it must be so in other wordes also, for like cause added.

And although it be referred to God, that he as the Lorde and Maister, and they as the seruauntes, altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his grace and strength, doe worke togither, the sense is not euill, yet not proper for this place. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Apostle doth not here sette out the dignitie of the ministers, but abaseth their labour and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth all to God. For hee had to doe with them, that did attribute too much vnto the ministers worke, with whome it was vnseasonable, to extoll their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and make them coadiutors or fellow helpers of God. But contrariwise hee ascribeth the fruite of all their labours to God, and to take away the Schismes that were among them, by depending of one minister more than an other, declareth that they altogither are Gods labourers, Gods husbandmen, &amp;c. In the other place 2. Cor. 6. v. 1. <gap reason="foreign">

Nexte followeth an open outcrie against Beza, for false translation, &amp; our transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, for being ashamed to follow him. If we mislike Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaes translation, are wee by and by ashamed to followe him? And if his translation be false, as you affirme, and we ashamed to folow him in falsehood: do we deserue to be defied as hypocrits, because we prefer the truth before the credite of our maister, as you call him.

But let vs see, whether Beza deserue so much blame, as you charge him withall. Beza hauing translated (as he thought) most neare to the Apostles meaning, Eph. 2. v. 5. in his annotation vpon the place, thus writeth: <hi>Conuiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficauit, &amp;c.</hi> The vulgar, and Erasmus translate, he hath quickened vs togither with Christ, which sense I doe in no wise reprehend. But yet nothing shall be detracted from the selfe same matter, and perhaps it may be sayde more aptly, that the preposition <gap reason="foreign">

I will giue you a tast of some, and let all men iudge whether they be not intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable faultes. For they are no lesse than detracting and taking away from the word of God. As 1. Cor. 14. v. 38. where both the Greeke and the Latine is, If they will learne. Your translation is: If they learne any thing. Likewise Actes 5. v. 4. where bothe the Greeke and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine is: Festus answeared that Paule is kepte at Caesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea: you translate. Festus answered that Paule is in Caesarea: leauing out the worde (kepte) as before you lefte out the worde (will) or (desire) whiche alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the sense very much. But in a place of greater moment, and in a matter of some controuersie, of Gods particuler preordination, and fore appointment, you leaue out a whole clause Act. 10. v. 41. For where it is bothe in the Greeke and in the Latine, that God made the resurrection of his sonne manifest: not to all the people, but to the witnesses chosen before of God, to vs which did eate and drinke with him, &amp;c. Your En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish translation hath no more but thus: Not to all the people, but to vs, who did eate and drinke with him, &amp;c. Leauing cleane out that which is in your Latine text, <hi>Testibus praeordinatis à Deo.</hi> Also in the Epistle to the Hebrues cap. 7. v. 28. where bothe the Greeke and your vulgar Latine hath. The law appointeth Priests, men that haue infirmitie, your translation is, the lawe appointeth Priests them that haue infirmitie, leauing out <hi>Homines,</hi> a word very material in this place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to obserue the opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betweene the Priesthood of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; the Priesthood of the sonne of God.

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:2866:216" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this place vseth the worde of absoluing or acquitting, in the same sense that he doth iustifying in other places, where hee speaketh of the same matter: and sayeth as plainely as a man can speake, that to be iustified, and to be made iuste, or pronounced, or accompted iust bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God is all one. Yet our Momus findeth faulte with him, for expounding, to be iustified, Rom. 2. v. 13. to bee pronounced iuste, as thoughe God will pronounce anye man iuste, whiche is not iuste indeede. But Beza (hee saith) elsewhere, protesteth that to be iustified, is not to be pronounced or accompted iuste, but rather to be iust indeede. If Martin hadde not beelyed Beza, we shoulde haue hadde Bezaes wordes sette downe, bothe in Latine and Englishe. But in truth Beza hath no suche words: yet in sense he hath thus muche, that to be iustified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, is to be iuste indeede, and not to bee onely pronounced or accompted iuste, when hee is not so in deede. But that wee are made truely iust indeede, by the iustice of Christe, whiche is imputed vnto vs freely by faith. And as for that newe life or iustice whiche is called inhere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in vs, it is not the cause but the witnes of that iustice, by imputation of whiche, wee are saued, folowing him that is iustified, and not going before iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification: and faith indede, is the instrument by which we apprehend Christ our iustice. Neither doth Beza say, that we are not truely iustified by faith: but that faith is not the principall efficient cause, which is the mercie of God, but the instrumentall cause, by whiche wee take holde of the mercie of God in Christe. In al this, Beza hath said nothing contrarie to himself, nor to the truth. And it is no absurditie to say, that the iustice of Christe, by which we are iustified is no more inherent in vs, than his glorie. And yet both assured vnto vs by faith. As for that iustice, whiche is an effect of Gods sanctifying spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and a fruite of our iustification beefore God, by whiche also we are iustified, or declared iuste beefore men, as S.

The places of scripture that you cite speaking of sinne &amp; iustice alike, be not contrary to the imputation of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice vnto them in which it is not inherent. For in nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of both places the holy ghost vseth the word of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, howsoeuer S. Hierome translateth it, but the verbe substantiue. And the meaning is plaine. It shal be sinne in thee: for sinne is indeede inherent, as perfecte iustice also shoulde bee if wee coulde obserue all the commaundements of God as Moses sayeth. Deut. 6. and we shoulde be iustified thereby. But by one iuste acte whereof Moses speaketh, Deut. 24. thoughe it proceede of iustice that is in vs, the scripture neuer saith that wee shall be iustified. To conclude, wee confesse, that bothe sinne and iustice are in the children of God, but not that iustice, whereby they are reputed iuste or iustified, or made iuste beefore God, but an effecte or fruite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>

For we say, that to be iustified, and be reputed iust, and to obtaine iustice, is all one in this case. But where S. Iames sayth, that Abraham was iustified by workes, he meaneth, that he was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red iust before men, euen as he sayth, shewe me thy faith by thy workes, for Abraham was not iustified by a dead faith, but by a working faith: and yet he was not iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before God by workes, but the Scripture was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led which sayd, Abraham beleued God, and it was repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him for iustice, which is as S. Paule expoundeth it, Abraham was iustified before God, by faith, and not by workes, But in Gen. 15. v. 6. there is not the preposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (for) or (in steede) but simply iustice; therefore it should be translated he reputed it to him iustice. And will you then controule both the Apostles, Paule, and Iames, for adding the preposition <gap reason="foreign">

He reputed it to him as iustice, or for iustice. Must not such particles in translation be alwayes expressed, to make the sense plaine, which in English without the particle, hath no sense or vnderstanding? To translate precisely out of the Hebrew, is not to obserue the number of wordes, but the perfect sense and meaning of them, in fewer or more wordes, as the phrase of our tongue will serue to be vnderstood: or else 2.

Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the workes worthy, or meete for repentance, doe argue the repentance to be vnfained, and vndissembled, but they proue not that by them a satisfaction is made for the sinnes committed before repentance. For a newe life, newe maners, newe fruites, must follow a mind, that is truely turned vnto God; and chaunged from delight in sinne, to hate and abhorre sinne, and to studye vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of life.</p>

<pb n="366" facs="tcp:2866:233" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this fraile nature. Againe that the two former are signified and spoken of in the three places of Scripture by him alleaged. Where we see, that he readeth altogither as the vulgar interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter translateth, and expoundeth all three places of penance for sinne, and so approueth that signification of the Greeke worde. Yea in saying that for veniall sinnes we knocke our breast, fast, giue almes, and pray, and so cease not <hi>Quotidianam agere poenitentiam:</hi> what doth he meane but daily penance and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction? Reade also S. Cyprian (beside other places) epist. 52. num. 6. Where his citatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Scripture are according to the old Latin interpreter, and his exposition according, of doing pena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and making satisfaction for sinnes committed. But I neede not proceede further in alleaging either S. Cyprian or other aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fathers for this purpose, because the Aduersaries graunt it. Howbeit in what termes they graunt it, and how malapertly they accuse all the auncient fathers at once for the same, it shall not be amisse here to put downe their wordes.</p>

                           <p>FVLK. 9. S. Augustine speaketh nothing of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for sinnes, but as I haue said, of such exercises as were appointed by the Church, to testifie their repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. The occasion of all these wordes, was of one that was a Nouatian, who said that Peter was not baptized, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was receyued into repentance after his deniall. And where he vsed this worde <hi>Egisse poenitentiam,</hi> S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine denieth, that he did open penance, <q>as they that we properly called poenitentes: <hi>Quod autem dicitur Petrum egisse poenitentiam.</hi> But where it is saide that Peter did penance, wee muste beware that hee bee not thought so to haue done it, as they do it in the Church, which are properly called Poenitentes. And who can abide this, that wee shoulde thinke, that the chiefe of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles is to be numbred among such poenitents? For it repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted him that he denied Christ, which thing his tears doe shewe.</q> These words declare, that <hi>Agere poenitentiam</hi> with Augustine, signifieth to be inwardly repentant, as well as to doe those externall workes, which are tokens of repentance. Also that teares, fastings, and such like,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:2866:233" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are arguments, and signes of repentance before God, and not any parte of that repentance in deede and much lesse any satisfaction for sinnes. Of this penance or repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of S. Peter, S. Ambrose saith, <hi>Lachrymas eius lego, satisfactionem non lego,</hi> I reade of his teares, I reade not of<note place="margin">

In that Augustine vseth the wordes of the olde interpretor, it is no matter, for he vseth also his meaning. But this vsage of his, proueth not the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of the vulgar Latine translation, but contrari wise, it is certaine that S. Augustine followed an other tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation, for in the text, 2. Cor. 12. where your vulgar La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine hath, <hi>Super immunditia &amp; fornicatione &amp; impudicitia quam gesserunt.</hi> S. Augustine readeth, <hi>Super immunditia &amp; luxuria &amp; fornicatione quam egerunt.</hi> That S. Cyprian vseth the terme <hi>Agere poenitentiam,</hi> and satisfaction also, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of publike repentance, it shall be easily graunted, but in none other sense, than I haue often declared. But where you say, that his citations are according to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine interpretor, it is false. For Apoc. 2. your vulgar text is, <hi>Memor esto itaque vnde excideris, &amp; age poenitentiam &amp; prima opera fac.</hi> But Cyprians citation is, <hi>Memento vnde cecideris, &amp; age poenitentiam, &amp; fac priora opera.</hi> Likewise Psalm. 88. you reade in your vulgar Latine, <hi>Visitabo in virga iniquitates eorum, &amp; in verberibus peccata eorum.</hi> But Cyprian citeth thus. <hi>Visitabo in virga facinora eorum, &amp; in flagellis delicta eorum.</hi> But that his exposition is of any other penance, than of open penance, or of any other sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, than of satisfaction to the Church, your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries will not graunt you, although they may graunt you, that he ascribed too much vnto such externall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of repentance.</p>

Thus therefore I
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:2866:242"/>
am perswaded those verses are to be translated.

But the contrary may easily be gathered: for seeing our Sauiour Christ baptised none him selfe, it shall follow that the Apostles were either not baptised at all, or els baptised onely with Iohns baptisme.

wherein you maye bee so manifestly conuicted by hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreths of witnesses, you stoppe the waye from any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite to bee giuen you in other matters. All Oxforde knewe, that Campion was no Graecian, when hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from that Vniuersitie. His time spent in Ireland, and other places, where he trauailed, woulde not yeelde him greate knowledge since his departure, excepte hee hadde wholy applyed it, whyche he coulde not doe, nor any other serious studie in such sorte as he traueiled in diuerse places. But admitte he might haue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by extraordinarie meanes or myracle if you wil, howe shall hee bee tried, but by reading and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that whyche greately concerneth his cause, in disputation and conference. You saide he didde reade and interprete Saint Basil, not the easiest of the Greeke Doctours. I was not present at that conference, and therefore haue the lesse to saye: But I my selfe making triall of hys skill. by a place of Epiphanius, both read it to him, and offering him the booke, he vnderstode no more the matter thereof, than if I hadde cited it in the Arabicke, or Persian language. And therefore, vpon the acknowledging of his dissembled ignorance, with great laughter of the hearers, I was content to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde it to him in Englishe, beefore I coulde receiue any aunsweare to the argument taken from that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Wherefore, I verily thinke, and am certainely perswaded, that if he pretended to interprete any thing out of Saint Basil, it was altogither by artificiall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture, either of the place which he knewe, and had read in Latine, or else by surmising of some one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon worde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee gathered what the sense of the whole shoulde bee. Indeede<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if hee hadde neuer knowne a word of Greeke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> althoughe hee had bene no meete man to chalenge a whole realme to disputation: yet hee might haue beene an honest man, and otherwise meanly learned, so hee had not pretended knowledge.
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:2866:271" rendition="simple:additions"/>
when he was in a maner altogither ignorant. For mine owne parte, thoughe it please you to name mee with Maister Humfrey, Maister Whitakers, and others, I neuer tooke vpon mee but a meane knowledge in the tongues, neither desire I in comparison to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before any learned manne, whose trauailes haue bin profitable to the Churche, althoughe he were ignorant in the tongues. Yet, this I muste freely say, that he which shall professe to bee an absolute learned diuine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge of three tongues, at the leaste, may thinke wel of himselfe, but hardely hee shall gette and retaine the credite hee seeketh amoung learned menne in this learned age. And therefore Campion, if disputation hadde beene meante rather than sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for al his arrogance and impudence, was an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meete Apostle to bee sente from Gregorie of Rome, to chalenge all the wise and learned in England. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I say this, as thoughe I measured all learning by knowledge of the tongues, but wherein soeuer any Papist in the worlde, shall bee bolde to chalenge the name of learning, in anie knowledge, that euer was, or is accounted good learning, God bee praysed, there are many of Gods true Catholike Churche, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are members, able to match them therein. That I saye not to excell them. And whereas you woulde make vs beholding to Papistes for suche knowledge, as any of vs hathe in the Greeke, Hebrewe, Syriacke, Chaldee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Arabicke tongues, &amp;c. It is well knowne, the Papistes are more beholding to vs. And although I confesse, that some Papistes of late dayes, haue besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed fruitefull paines, in setting foorth some of the orientall tongues: yet are they not the firste, nor all that haue traueiled profitably that wai<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>. But manye haue attained to competent skill in those langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges many yeares beefore anye Papistes had written anye thing that mighte further them therein. You were wont to beare ignoraunt menne in hande, that we
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:2866:271" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were a sight of English Doctors, vnderstanding no lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages but our mother tongue, which hath enforced di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse men to shewe their skill in the tongues, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise they would neuer haue openly professed. But now that the worlde seeth, to your shame, how richly God hath blessed vs, with the knowledge, and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of diuerse tongues, you exprobrate to vs our knowledge in the tongues, and traduce vs among the ignorant, as though we esteemed all learning by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of tongues, and that we were but meare Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, &amp; often tell vs of that stale iest, that the kingdome of Grammarians is paste, as though it were but a little Grammar, whereof we make a shew. But for that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall muster which you threaten to driue vs vnto, ere it be long, if you come as learned men should do, armed with bookes, penne, inke, and paper, I doubt not by the grace of God, but you shall finde them that dare confront you, and chase you out of the field also. But if you come vnder the Popes banner with such blessing, as he sente lately into Ireland, I hope you shall be mette with all, as those his champions were, and finde that promotion for your good seruice, whiche you haue long agoe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued by your trauailes for vpholding of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>

the auncient fathers, telling vs withall that therfore the reading of the fathers, is no certaine rule to reforme or alter the words of Scripture according to the same: and it is very like that if Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za or Fulke his aduocate had thought S.

But for S. Basill, according to the sense he citeth it very truely: for, whether wee say, <hi>the Cuppe that is shed,</hi> or, <hi>the bloud that is shed,</hi> both signifieth the bloud of Christ shed for vs, as S. Basil citeth it. The difference is, that referring it to the cuppe, as S. Luke hath it, it signifieth the bloud both present in the cuppe, and also then shed in a Sacrament at the last supper: but referring it to the word <hi>bloud,</hi> as S. Basil doth, and as they translate, it may signifie the bloud shed on the crosse also, yea (as these tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slatours meane and would haue it) only that on the Crosse, not considering that the Greeke worde is the present tense, and therfore rather signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the present shedding of his bloud then in mysticall sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, than the other visible shedding therof, which was to come in the future tense. Lastly, they translate S. Lukes Gospel, and not S. Basil: and therefore not folowing S. Luke, they are false tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slators, how soeuer S. Basil readeth.</p>

                           <p>FVLK. 4. If the Apostle had meant nothing by the preposition, he might, and would, (as it is most like) haue left it cleane out, yea, if he had meant no more, but the adoration of Iosephs scepter, what needed he to haue added the toppe, or the extremitie? or why was the top of his scepter more to be adored, than all the other length of it? But certayne it is, the Apostle would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the Hebrewe preposition, which muste needes haue some signification. And where you aske them that haue skill in the Hebrewe, whether there be any force in the preposition, in those sayings out of the Psalme, that speake of worshipping, or falling downe before his footestoole, his holye hill, &amp;c. I aunswere, yea,
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:2866:289" rendition="simple:additions"/>
there is great force, for the hill was not to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, but he whose tabernacle or temple was on it. But you obiect, that we our selues neglect the preposition, Psal. 96. and say, worship the Lord. The fault is the lesse, because the worship is referred to none but the Lorde: yet the precise translation in that place, should be, bowe downe, or fall ye downe before the Lorde, in the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sanctuarie. And where you say, we shunne the worde of adoration, which the Hebrew, and Greeke, duely doe expresse, by termes applyed, for the most part signifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doring of creatures. You haue packed vp a great number of vntruthes, togither, as it were in a bundell. First, that we shunne the terme of adoring, for doubt of your <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> which is vtterly vntrue, for it is auoyded partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is more Latine, than English, partly because it doth not expresse either the Greeke, or the Latine termes, which the Scripture vseth.

For albeit in the most approued Greeke copies, the relatiue be of the neuter gender, limiting that which S. Peter speaketh, not to any matter at large in S. Paules Epistles, but to those things which S. Paule hath written, concerning the second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ, yet of the other Scriptures, he saith not,

Peter before did giue him. For euery man, that desireth to teach, as S.

But that some thinges about that high mysterie of the second comming of Christ, are harde to be vnderstood, dischargeth Paule of affectation of difficultie, or not regarde of perspicuitie, shewing the cause of the hardnesse, to be in the height of the matter, not in the handling of the writer. And that some did misunderstand the Apostle S. Paule writing of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is apparant, by the second epistle to the Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Chap. 2.</p>

Peter speaketh. These wordes declare, that God leadeth some men into temptation, and howe he leadeth them into temptation, namely, by giuing them ouer to Satan, who filleth their hart with all iniquitie.</q> But hereof it can not be proued, that he tempteth vnto euill. He sent the lying spirite into the mouth of Achabs Prophets, for a punishment vnto Achab, and them: yet he neither temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Achab to euil, nor his Prophets to lie. But you grate vpon these wordes, in the first edition, God bringeth Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan into a man. Beza meaneth no otherwise, than for a punishment, they are deliuered to Satan, as the lying spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite was sent to deceiue Achab, not that God filleth their hartes, but that Satan filleth their hartes, to their destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as Peter sayth: where you doe slaunderously ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that which Peter sayth of Satan, filling the hart of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias, to the whole sentence: as though Peter were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to say, that God sendeth Satan into a mans hart. That God did leade Ananias into temptation, for his hypocrisie, and gaue him ouer to Satan, who filled his hart, and possessed him, so that he lyed vnto the holye Ghost, we may safly affirme, and yet it followeth not, that God either tempted Ananias to his sinne, or els was author aund causer of that hainous sinne, otherwise than he is the good author and causer of all things, which as they are caused by him, they are good. And yet of such things (as S. Augustin sayth,) he is no euil author, he may be, and is a iust reuenger. Wherefore you can no better gather of this saying, that God is the author of sinne, than when we say, that God created the deuill, or man to be of free will, for if they had not bene of free will to sinne, they shoulde not haue sinned. Or if God had not suffered, and ordained the deuil first to fall, he could not haue tempted Eue, and so haue brought man to sinne. But as God is cleare from the sinne of the deuill, and of Adam, which yet he might haue kept from sinning: so is he cleare from the sinne of them, whome for a iuste plague, he leadeth into temptation, and giueth into the

For I am but one poore souldiour among manie thousand captaines, that fight vnder the banner of truth, which if I haue not in euery respect perfourmed al dueties of an expert warrior, it is reason the reproche of my defaultes should rest and stay onely in mine owne ignorance or rashnesse which haue not so happily executed that which of good will to fight in truthes cause I haue attempted within these fiue or sixe yeares. I haue set abroad sundrie treatises in confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of popish bookes written in English, which purpose if God giue me strength, to aunswere as manie as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in twentie yeares of her maiesties reigne, had beene set foorth by the Papistes, and are not yet confuted by any other. This purpose of mine, the Papistes haue not greatly hindered by replyes, for (except one onely Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe, who obseruing no good order of replying, but gathering here and there at his pleasure, whatsoeuer he thought himself best able to reproue, hath made a shew of defence of Allens Articles and Purgatorie) none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue as yet set foorth any iust replication to the rest of my writings.

I haue thought good therefore as neere as I can, to gather all their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils together, and briefely to shape an answere to euery one of them, that the indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t reader may see &amp; iudge what sound matter they haue brought against me wher with in shewe of wordes, they would haue it seeme, as though they had confuted me.</p>

In that booke pag. 248. there is nothing that soundeth toward such a matter, except it be these wordes: <q>As for Leo and Gregorie bishops of Rome, although they were not come to the full pride of Antichrist, yet the mysterie of iniquitie hauing wrought in that seat, neere fiue or sixe hundred yeres before them, and then great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increased, they were so deceiued with the long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of error, that they thought the dignitie of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was much more ouer the rest of his fellow Apostles, than the holy scriptures of God (against which no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of errour can prescribe) doth either allowe or beare withall. Wherefore although he haue some shew out of the old writers, yet hath he nothing directly to prooue, that Peter did excell the other Apostles in bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoplike authoritie: and out of the worde of God, no one iote or title, that Peter as a bishop excelled the other Apostles, not as Apostles but as bishops. First it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest euen to the eye, that Allens slander is not expressed in these wordes.</q> Then let vs see, if it may be imployed. The mysterie of iniquitie did worke in the see of Rome
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2866:319"/>
from the Apostles time, taking increase by litle &amp; litle, vntill sixe hundred yeares and more after Christ, when Antichrist began to be openly shewed: and manie of the ancient fathers not espying the subtiltie of Sathans secret purpose, were deceiued to thinke something more of Peters prerogatiue, &amp; of the bishops of Romes dignitie, than by the worde of God was granted to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them: this is in effect as much as I affirme, but here of it followeth not, that I make them the ministers and furtherers of Antichrist. For those are the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and furtherers of Antichrist, which willingly lend all their power to maintaine, and vphold his kingdom, after he hath inuaded the tyrannie: The auncient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers meant nothing lesse by admitting of the bishops of Romes prerogatiue, vnder colour of Peters succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour, than to serue him or aduance him into the throne of Antichrist. Not euerie one whome Satan hath sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that he might prepare a way for the aduauncement of his tyrannie, is a minister and furtherer of Satan or his tyrannie, for then should all men be counted mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters or furtherers of Satan, seeing the kingdome of sinne is increased by the frailtie of all men, which by temptation of the diuell fall into sinne. Beside that, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the auncient fathers, openly resisted the vsurped power of the bishops of Rome, when it began onely to budde vp, and was yet farre off from Antichristian ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie, although it tended somewhat toward the same.<note place="margin">Euseb. lib. 5 ca. 25. &amp; 26 Conc.

would appeale to any place beyond the sea, discouering also the forged Canon of the Nicen Councel, by which the bishops of Rome challenged that prerogatiue. So that M. Allen by this his slander, hath done iniury to mee, and hurt to himselfe, while men by this example may iudge of his synceritie in other matters.</p>
                  <p>Next commeth in the discouerie of I. Nicols, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that they make the Catholike religion locall, or of one prouince, as he chargeth mee (with some scorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full termes of reproche) to affirme in my bad answere to Howlet. I said in deede, that S. Augustine <hi>De vnit. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Cap. 4.</hi> doth cleare vs of schisme, who willingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with all the whole bodie of Christs Church, dispersed ouer the world, and charge the Popish faction both of schisme &amp; heresie: of schisme, because they maintaine the Church to be onely in a part of Europe, as the Donatistes did in Aphrica, &amp;c. And what iniury haue I done to the Papistes in so saying? The Donatists sayd, the Church was perished out of all the worlde, &amp; remained only in Aphrica: not assigning any place of Aphrica, whereunto the Church must be regardant, as the Papistes do the citie of Rome: but affirming that true Catholikes remained onely in Aphrica, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed out of all other partes of the earth. And what say the Papistes of all the Oriental churches of Greece, of Asia, of Aphrike, that acknowledge not the Popes authoritie? Doe they not accompt them all for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes or schismatikes? Then it followeth, that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Church to remaine only in those partes of Europe, that are subiect to the Pope, and Church of Rome. But perhaps they wil alledge their newly foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Churches in India and America, which vaine brag I will not stand to confute: but seeing this enlargement is but newe begun, in our graundfathers dayes, before those partes of the earth were discouered by nauigation òf the Portingals and Spaniardes, where was the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish church &amp; pope thereof acknowledged but onely
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2866:320" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in a piece of Europe. If yet they will alledge the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of any Patriarkes or Prelates of the Aethiopian or Armenian churches made to the Pope by some wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring pilgrimes, which are of no credit among wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, yet all men may knowe, that those Christians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to this day, in the same religion, rites and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, that they did before such pretended submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, holding and doing manie things contrarie to the Romish religion and custome, which argueth plainly, that they neither were, nor meane to become mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the church of Rome, and subiects to Popish re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which they refuse to receiue in as manie points, as euer they did. Wherefore the Popish church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth still shut vp within the streites of Europe, for any accession of them. And what enlargement so euer it hath in the newe world, it is rather by colonies of Portingals &amp; Spaniardes, than by conuersion of those barbarous nations. For as for them that were for feare of death compelled to receiue baptisme, as manie of the barbarous people haue been, no true Catholike can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge for good and Catholike Christians, who as occasion alwayes serued them, spared not to giue suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient testimonie of their counterfeit conuersion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appeared, that the sacrament of baptisme was in them prophaned, rather than that they by it were san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified. As for my bad answere to Howlet, as it seemeth was so sufficient, that neuer a Papist these two yeares can finde time to confute it. Although if they thought it too bad to confute, there hath beene since a better set forth with more aduise, by master Wyborne, but the replie we shall haue at greater leasure, the Howlet as I gesse being otherwise occupied in defence of his Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, for that his proude stomack had rather play the Iudge than the defendant.</p>
                  <p>The next quarell followeth in the thirde lease after, where he approueth I. Nicols affirming, as he sayeth, that Purgatorie, prayer for the dead, and inuocation of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2866:320"/>
Saints, are late inuentions of Popes &amp; Papists. <q>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as his owne companions, namely Fulke in his late an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to doctor Allen and doctor Bristowe confesseth that all these three errours were receiued in the church aboue 1200. yeares, that is in the times of Augustine, Ierome, Ambrose and vpwarde, and that these fathers with other beleeued them also. If to those three do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors which he named,</q> he had not added vpward, I must haue abated one hundred yeres at least of his account. But now let vs see, what I haue confessed of these do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and vpward. First against Purgatorie, page 306. But whosoeuer shall vouchsafe to turne the booke to that page, shall finde neuer a word of my writing, good or bad, but onely the first section of the ninth Chapter of Allens second booke. Wel, this may be the printers fault, peraduenture it is page 106. because it is not like that 306. should come before 115. the next quotation that followeth, but neither is there any thing to this purpose. Then let vs see what may be founde page 115. euen as much as in page 306. for there is neuer a worde of my writing in that page, but all is Allens. 8. chapter of the first booke. Then come we to the thirde quotation page 316. and there in deede is something sounding to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward this matter, touching prayer for the dead, which Augustine did allowe, but of purgatorie there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Of inuocation of Saints there is mention, but no affirmation that Augustin did beleeue it, for in the next page followeth a discourse to prooue that S. Augustine, as he declareth in his booke <hi>De cura pro mortuis &amp;c.</hi> was not certaine how the Saints departed should knowe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that is done in this worlde, although he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to that opinion, that they might haue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by relation of dead men, or of Angels, or else hee knoweth not howe, and so doth plainly confesse. From hence we must passe to page 320. where in deede, I doe confesse that Ambrose alloweth prayer for the dead, as it was a common error of his time, but not sacrifice of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2866:321"/>
the masse in that sense that Papistes do. Last of all. Ar<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. page 39. I denie, that for 200. yeares after Christ, it can be prooued, that any Catholike writer doth allow praier for the dead, or inuocation of Saints, and that the later error was not confirmed 400. yeares after Christ, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Saint Augustines time, in that small helpe was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by Chrysostome, to come to the dead by prayers made for them. In all those places S. Ierome is not once named, nor purgatorie confessed to bee receiued, whereof S. Augustine the laste of the three sometime doubteth, sometime vtterly denyeth any third place: neither did I euer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse, that any of those three errors were holden by these auncient fathers in all respects, as they are by the Papistes, nor that purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie was euer beleeued of any of them, onely Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine sometimes speaketh of it, as of a doubtful matter,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>De oct. Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit. quest. q.</hi> 1. <hi>De fid. &amp; op. c.</hi> 16. <hi>ser. in mont. lib.</hi> 1.</note> which he sayeth may be inquired, whether there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such place or no: and yet confuted those interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the scriptures which the Papistes make their chiefest groundes of it. By this you may see, how libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall this Iesuite is in extending my confession further than euer it was made or meant by mee, or can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by him or any Papist of them all.</p>
                  <p>The third leafe againe, after this, he saieth that Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cols by citing a place of Augustine, woulde haue men thinke that S. Augustine disallowed prayer to Saints, which is contrarie to Fulkes opinion, who confesseth Augustine to haue defended this superstition, as hee termeth it, and rayleth on him for it. For this is quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Purg. pag. 315. 316. 317. Howe hee gathereth, what Nicols would haue men thinke, let other men iudge. And what mine opinion is of Augustines allowing of prayer to Saints, I haue before expressed out of the places quoted: but where he sayeth, I raile on him for it, that is but a fryers report, which seldome differeth from a lie. For this is all I say of him for it. By such places as I haue in those pages cited out of Augustine,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2866:321"/>
it is proued, <q>that although Augustine were willing to maintaine the superstition, that was not throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in his time, about burials and inuocation of Saints, yet he hath nothing of certeintie out of the worde of God, either to perswade his owne conscience, or to satisfie them that moued the doubtes vnto him.</q> Whether in these wordes I haue rayled, I submit my selfe to the iudgement of the reader, that will weigh what I haue cited out of S. Augustine, in the pages mentioned.</p>
                  <p>In the same leafe, and the next page, the margent is painted with quotations out of my booke against Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie. But what thinke you to proue? Forsooth, that his aduersaries do confesse all the olde fathers to be on their side, and to haue erred with them, <q>as Fulke doth of S. Ambrose, Austen, Tertullian, Origen, Chrysostom, Gregorie, and Bede by name, with most reprochefull and contemptuous words against them. This is spoken generally,</q> as though we confesse all the doctors to bee on their side, in euery controuersie, which we doe not acknowledge to be true in any one, although many of the later sort do in some part fauour one or two errours of theirs among an hundreth. But let vs examine his prooues, which seeme to be verie plentifull, yet of nine quotations I must needes strike out two, page 306. and 279. because in them is not one syllable of my writing, but all of Allens. In the pages 315. &amp; 316. is nothing more contained touching this matter, than I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie declared. There remaineth nowe, page 349. where I say touching a rule of S. Augustine, which hee giueth to trie faith and doctrine of the Church onely by the scripture, that if he had as diligently followed it, <q>in examining the common error of his time, of prayer for the dead, as he did in beating downe the schisme of the Donatistes, or the heresie of the Pelagians, hee woulde not so blindly haue defended that which by holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he was not able to maintaine, as he doeth in that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2866:322"/>
booke <hi>De Cura pro mortuis agenda,</hi> and else where.</q> What most reprochefull or contemptuous wordes are here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst S. Augustine? Seeing the holie scripture is a light shining in a darke place, as S. Peter sayeth, who so goeth without it must walke blindly, which I say in commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the light of the scripture, not in contempt of Augustines reason, whome as I may not honour, with contempt of the trueth: so when he is a patrone &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer of the truth, I honour him from my heart. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise page 78. Saint Ambrose is named, but nothing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to fauour any popish errour. Augustine is againe noted speaking of the amending fire, whereof he hath no ground, but in the common errour of his time, and whereof he affirmeth sometimes, that it is a matter that may bee doubted of, sometimes that there is no third place at all. Wherefore this place hath neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochful wordes, nor confession of any constant opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Augustine, inclining to your errours. <q>Then let vs passe to the next place which is page 435. where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this matter, I haue written thus: I denie that any of the auncient fathers in Christs time, or scholers to his Apostles, or within one or two hundreth yeares after Christ, except one that had it of Montanus the heretike, as he had more things beside, in any one word, maintained your cause for purgatorie or prayers for the dead. Secondly of them that maintained prayers for the dead, the most confessed, they had it not out of the scriptures, but of tradition of the Apostles, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the church, therefore they are not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared vnto vs in better vnderstanding of the scriptures, for that point, which they denyed to be receiued of the scriptures. Thirdly, those of the auncient fathers that agreed with you in any part of your assertion (for none within 400. yeares was wholly of your errour) notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing manie excellent gifts that they had, yet main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained other errors beside that, and about that, diffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one from another, and sometime the same man
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2866:322"/>
from himselfe, and that is worst of all, from manifest truth of the holy scriptures. Therefore neither is their erronious interpretation in this matter to be receiued, nor M. Allens wise iudgement of vs to bee regarded.</q> Here also I appeale to the iudgement of indifferent readers, what confession I haue made of the fathers to be on their side, or what reprochefull or contemptuous wordes I haue vsed against them, for dissenting from vs. The next place is quoted, page 247. where I say against Allen, boasting of auncient testimonies, for prayer for the dead: <q>I will not denie but you haue much drosse and dregges, of the later sort of doctors, &amp; the later, the fuller of drosse. But bring me any worde out of Iustinus Martyr, Irenaeus, Clemens Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, or any that did write within one hundreth yeares after Christ, that aloweth prayer or almes for the dead, &amp; I will say you are as good as your word.</q> Here except he will cauil, that I acknowledge much drosse and dregs to be in the later sort of doctors, I knowe not what hee findeth that hath any shadowe of his slander. But the trueth must be confessed, that the pure waters of life are to be founde onely in the worde of God, and beside that the best and purest liquors that are to bee seene, are not cleare from all dregges and drosse of humane error and frailtie. In the next page Origen deliuered from the shamefull mangling of Allens allegation, is shewed plainly to be an enimie of purgatorie &amp; prayer for the dead, in that he affirmeth the day of a Christian mans death to be the ende of all sorrowe, and the beginning of all felicitie. There remaineth nowe the last place quoted, page 194. where I acknowledge, that Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, Bernard, &amp; Bede, vpon the text Matth. 12. are of opinion that sinnes not remitted in this world, may be remitted in the world to come. But how happeneth it (say I) that Chrysostome &amp; Ieronyme which both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted that place, could gather no such matter, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they otherwise allowed prayer for the dead.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2866:323"/>
                     <q>The reason must needes be, because the errour of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie growing so much the stronger, as it was neerer to the full reuelation of Antichrist, Gregorie and Bede sought not the true meaning of Christ in this scripture, but the confirmation of their plausible error.</q> Here is all the confessions, most reprochefull &amp; contemptuous wordes, that are conteined in so manie of those places as he hath quoted, in which I will not tarrie to rehearse how manie vntruthes he hath vttered against mee, but wish the indifferent reader to consider, that if he be so bolde to slander mee concerning a booke printed in English, by which he may be conuinced of euerie sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple reader, what dare he not aduouch of matters done and past at Rome, whither none may trauell to trie out his tretcherie, but he is in manifest danger neuer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne the answere of his message?</p>
                  <p>From this Popish Parson whatsoeuer his name be, I must passe to another gentleman namelesse in deede, but not blamelesse, yea much more blame worthie than the other: who among so manie and so great flanders, as it is wonder howe they could bee conueyed into so<note place="margin">The epistle <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And first of all, page 46. of his Latine Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, after he hath described the manner of quartering vsed in the execution of traytors, and most impudently flandered the officers of Iustice, to make such haste in cutting downe the Papistes, which are hanged, as they vse not in punishment of other traytours, to the ende they might satisfie their cruel minds in their torments, which is proued false by manie thousand eye witnesses, that haue not lightly seene any of them reuiue with
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2866:323"/>
any sense of their paynes, except one Storie, who also did hang so long before he was cut downe, that it was great wondering to manie to see him so soone recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, not onely in life, but also in strength. At length he commeth in his tragical manner, to inueigh against the crueltie of their aduersaries, whome this cruell sight doth nothing at all moue to pitie, but they laugh and make sport at it, <q>and insult against them that are a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But especially (saieth hee) if any ouercome with paine, hath giuen foorth any groning which yet happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth most seldome, so one of them no meane prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher in a certeine imprinted booke, doeth gather that ours are not true martyrs, because one of them (as he himselfe affirmeth) gaue foorth a certaine howling as of an helhound, that I may vse his owne wordes. O sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence worthie of a preacher! O new charitie of the new gospel! What ruffinaly theefe at any time hath not blushed to vtter such a voice? What murtherer did euer shewe a minde so cruell and barbarous?</q> This froth of wordes I might easily match with like rhetoricall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations. O impudent lyer, O shamelesse slanderer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O trayterous backbyter, &amp;c. But I had rather beat it downe with trueth of matter. Bristowe in his booke of Motiues, maketh Martyrs his 15. Motiue. Among whome hee commendeth as well for the goodnes of their cause, as also for their patient suffering: <q>The good Earle of Northumberland (I vse his owne traiterous wordes) Storie, Felton, Nortons, Woodhouse, Plom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, and so manie hundreths of the Northeren men,</q> whome approued by miracles vndoubted he opposeth against Foxes martyrs as he calleth them. Against this traiterous commendation of open rebels and traitors, among other things thus I haue written, Retent. page 59. <q>Seeing not the paine but the cause, maketh a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, whosoeuer haue suffered for treason and rebellion, may well be accounted Martyrs of the popish church, but the church of Christ condemneth such for enimies
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2866:324"/>
of Christes kingdome, and inheritours of eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, except they repent and obteine mercie for their horrible wickednesse. And seeing patient suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is by Bristowes owne confession, a gift of God vnto all true martyrs, such as were manifestly voyde of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience can be no true martyrs, as were most of these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels and traitors, and Storie by name: who for all his glorious tale, in the time of his most deserued execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by quartering, was so impatient, that he did not onely roare and crye like an helhound, but also strake the executioner doing his office, and resisted as long as strength did serue him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being kept downe by three or foure men, vntill he was dead. O patient martyr of the popish church!</q> What cause had this slaunderous spirite vppon these my wordes, to make such hydeous outcryes, what theefe? what ruffian? what murderer? or what matter is ministred in this my saying, to accuse all the aduersaries of Papistes in England, of such bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous crueltie? We are not so voide of humanitie, but we lament y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miserie euen of our greatest &amp; most grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les enimies: but yet wee are not so voide of vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, to acknowledge impatient suffering to bee true martyrdome, no not if the cause were neuer so good. Not that wee thinke true martyrs to be voide of sense and feeling of their torments, or that they may not te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie their paines, euen with teares and strong crying sometimes, but that there is a great difference between the crying of patient martyrs vnto God for strength &amp; comfort, and the brutish roaring of impatient sufferers, expressed only with paine and torment, as was this of Storie, who vttered no voice of prayer in all that time of his crying (as I heard of the verie executioner him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, beside them that stoode by) but onely roared and cryed as one ouercome with the sharpnes of the paine, as no martyr is, whome God is faithfull to deliuer out of temptation: so that although they haue neuer so great sense of their torment, yet are they neuer ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2866:324"/>
thereby. But peraduenture this orator for the popish traytors, wil take me vp, for concluding against Storie, that he did not pray, because no voice of prayer was heard to come from him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as though I could not consider, that he was immediatly before strangled, so that the passage of his voice might be stopped, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that roaring were his prayer, yet it might not bee vnderstood by them which heard it. In deede if there had beene no other signe of his impatiencie, but his cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I would not haue beene bolde to haue iudged ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and made him an example of impatiencie, as I did. But what patient martyr euer strake his tormentor? Who praying for his persecutors, would striue to buffet and beat them. What man submitting himselfe to the will of God in his suffering, would resist the executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that he might not suffer? yea, when there was no remedie but he must suffer? except God for his crueltie shewed against his patient saints, had not onely giuen him a taste of such torments as he procured to others, but also made him an open spectacle of the impatient &amp; vncomfortable state of them, that suffer, not in a good cause, and with a good conscience. By this it is manifest how honestly this proctor of the persecuted Papistes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, that vpon a litle groning I gather that hee was no true martyr, and further rayleth as his facultie well serueth him.</p>
                  <p>The like honest dealing and trueth is shewed in the English translation of this pamphlet, toward the latter ende, where hee speaketh of certaine imprisoned &amp; py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with famine at Yorke. There in the margent, Fulke is placed, as though he had beene author or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuter of some persecution at Yorke, neere to which ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, he neuer came by 40. miles. But this will be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed perhaps by the printers fault, because it is not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Latine. Howsoeuer it be, it argueth a lying and a slaunderous stomack of the setters foorth of this treatise, that would suffer so open and so appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

                  <p>But the storie of the conference at Wisbich, is a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie matter, wherein not onely this rhetoritian, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the confuter of M. Charke (if they be not both one Parson, as I gesse they be) haue thought good to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise their stile. The trueth whereof is this, as it is easie to be prooued in euery respect by sufficient testimonies. It pleased the Lordes and other of her maiesties coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, after those obstinate recusantes were committed to safe keeping in Wisbich castell, to direct their let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Bishoppe of Elye (in whose diocesse and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle the prisoners were kept) requiring him to prouide, that they might haue conference, if they would admit any, and be called vppon to come to the Church, and heare the preaching there: whereupon the Bishoppe making choise of me, among other whom he purposed to sende vnto them, desired mee by his Chauncellor M. Doctor Bridgewater, to repayre vnto him into the Isle, from whence he sent me with a gentleman of his house, to signifie to them that had the charge of those prisoners, the cause of my comming. Whereupon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sewed that speeche in the presence of certaine honest men specially called and required to be witnesses, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides a number of other of good credite, the summe wherof as it was written at the present time, by three or foure that came with mee, of which one is a learned preacher, was collected to certifie the Bishop as neere as could be, what communication had passed betweene vs, without any further purpose of publishing the same. But the copie thereof comming into the handes of a friende of mine at London, and by him communicated to some other of his friendes, at last came into a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters hande, who sodenly set it abroade vnknowing to my friende and me. Which how well it was liked of me &amp; my friende, some of the best of the companie of Stationers can testifie, by that, meanes was made to

haue the printer punished, and hadde not Campions proude and vaine chalenge come euen in the nicke, I could not haue beene perswaded by my friendes, to haue suffered the partie to goe so cleare as he did. This is the whole truth &amp; euery part thereof, which if this dainty orator durst shew his face in any honest prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in England, may be prooued by such sufficient witnesse and euidence, as no reasonable person coulde refuse. Notwithstanding let vs see, what a rhetorical lier with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare of God, or shame of the worlde, without knowledge of the matter, or meanes to haue intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, can deuise to publish in the face of the world, to bolster the obstinacie of those wilfull recufants, and to deface the honest indeuour of them that seeke first to reforme them, and if that can not be, to take away ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse of ignorance from them. There is a certaine mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister (sayth he) great in his owne opinion, but in other mens opinion but meane, &amp;c. Marke how boldly euen in the beginning he blusheth not to affirme, that which it is impossible for him to knowe. For albeit I were as great in mine owne opinion, as he reporteth me to be, yet howe coulde hee bee priuie to my concept, who though he knowe my person, yet is he not acquainted with my maners, that hee might make coniecture by them. Neither is it like, he can heare it by report of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men. For I trust they which knowe me most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly, cannot report, that my behauiour argueth any such great opinion of my selfe. But he gathereth it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps either by my preaching, or by my writing. What skill I haue in any thing God knoweth best, and then they with whom I liue. And that I make as litle shewe of that I knowe, as any man in such cases may conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently, I answere, they that haue most cause to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what I am, will not refuse to testifie. That he sayth I am meane in other mens opinions, it greeueth me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: rather I am afraide least a great number accept me to be better than I deserue. But to omitte this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:2866:326"/>
by which yet you may gather, what likelihoode of trueth is in the rest of his assertions, he proceedeth to accuse me that for hope of a litle vaineglorie, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with noble men, <hi>cum magnatibus</hi> (so the honest subiect calleth Watson the Bishop, and Fecknam the Abbot so long since by lawefull authoritie depriued of those dignities) I crept secretly into the castle vnloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for. But if my comming were of hope to winne glorie, why did I not rather come openly, or cause them to be brought into the Church before the whole multitude? Well, admit I was so blinde with desire of vaineglorie that I could not see<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which way I might best come to it. Why should he say that I crept into the castle, as it were by stealth? Belike because I came without authoritie, for so he sayth afterwarde, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes sawe that I came to offer them conference by no publike authoritie. If that had beene so, howe coulde this stande which he sayth, <hi>Sisti iubet omnes ad s<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

Did he commaund them by his priuate au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie? or were they which had them in custody so simple, that they would obey an vnknowne person, a meane man, of small or no account, comming without authoritie or commanding in his owne name, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the name of them that had authoritie without sufficient warrant? or rather was it not well saide, that a lyer in a large tale is the best confuter of himselfe? Although in verie truth, I gaue no commandement for their appearance before me, onely the bishoppes will was declared by the gentleman his seruant, vnto their keeper. But what should I stande to rippe vp those va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities? All reasonable conditions of bookes, time and order for the conference were offered them. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, I am certainely perswaded, that something per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the disdaine of my person, but more the feare of the weakenesse of their cause stayed them, that they would not aduenture their credit in triall by disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

For if the contempt of my lightnesse and rashnesse (as their proctor sayeth) had beene the onely cause of their refusall, why did they not yeelde to dispute in the vniuersitie in which are many of more grauitie or lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yea why did they conclude in the ende that all disputation in matters of faith, was vnprofitable, allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging examples of the disputation in the conuocation house, in the beginning of the Queenes maiesties raigne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the conference at Westminster in presence of almost all the learned and wise of the realme in the beginning of her maiesties reigne? For the publishing of the report and the certeinty of the contents thereof, I haue shewed sufficiently, as the truth of the matter was, and as I will be able to iustifie by good witnesse, whatsoeuer this impudent lier hath aduouched to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie. The same is also sufficient to confute the same slander repeted by the confuter of Maister Charke in Epist. pa. 9. concerning my onely looking into Wisbich castle, and printing a pamphlet in mine owne praise, where if I had fained matter for my prayse I might as well haue faigned, howe valiantly I had vanquished mine enemies. For small praise is gotten where there is no victory, &amp; victory can be none where there is no bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell. The like slander he hath, but with more wordes of reproch pag. 2. of his defense, where beside his ruffian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like rayling, which is a greater fault in him that repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth others, for intemperate speech, there is nothing more in substance, but that I did set foorth that pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet in mine owne commendation, and I attempted the matter without authoritie, wherein without all rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torike I must tell him plainely, hee lyeth impudently.

But if you be so sharpe set vpon disputation, as you pretende, why doth neuer a papist of you all aunswere my cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge made openly in print to all learned papists, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most three yeere ago, set before my Retentiue against Bristowes Motiues, wherein you may expresse, what you haue in mainteinaunce of your opinion, without suite, without danger, and to the best and surest try all of the trueth. But nowe it is time to come to other cauilles of this syrly censurer. They are of two sorts, the one concerning wordes, the other touching matter. I will beginne first with the wordes, and as neere as I can readily finde them, I wil quote the places of my bookes where I haue vsed them. And letting the reader see what cause moued mee sometimes to such vehement termes, I referre it to his iudgement. whether I haue passed the bondes of modestie, or equitie, yea or nay. First he chargeth me with a ruffianlike spirite, because I say to Allen: Shewe me Allen if thou canst for thy guttes. pag. 241. In that place I answere to Allen, which scornefully biddeth the Papistes say vnto vs: <q>M. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant, let me haue sight of your onely fayth, I would be of that religion, &amp;c.</q> that Iames calleth pure and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted, &amp;c. Whiles he requireth a sight of our fayth by our good workes, I aunswere that because the tryall of singular persons is vncertaine, and vnpossible, let vs consider the whole states. Then followeth: Shewe me if thou canst for thy guttes, or name any popish citie, that hath made such prouision for the fatherlesse and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2866:327"/>
widowes, as the citie of London, &amp;c. What speech is heare like a ruffian? Except the delicate censurer, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide to heare Allens guts named, but he thinketh it russianlike: as though he had neuer hearde of these phrases, <hi>ruparis licet, non si te ruperis inquit, rumpantur ut ilia Codro.</hi> In which, sauing the authoritie of this noble censurer, no wise man did euer conceiue any ruffianlike spirite. It sauoureth a great deale more of a ruffianlike spirite, that himselfe abuseth the phrases of the holie Ghost, to scorning and scoffing, as heare in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, Doctor Fulkes tallent in rayling, and pag. 50.

But let vs examine what rayling he hath noted out of my Retentiue against Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowes Motiues. First, leaud Losell, and vnlearned dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt, which I finde pag. 6. where I say, that some of the Papistes were moderators of the conference at West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster, at least one: <q>namely, D. Heath then occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the place of the Bishoppe of Yorke. Therefore not onely lay Lordes and vnlearned heretikes, as this leaude losell, and vnlearned dogbolt, and trayterous papist (I am bolde with him because he is so malepeart with the learned and godly nobilitie of England) most slaunderously and maliciously affirmeth, were onely moderators of that disputation, but some of the popish faction, were not onely present, but presidentes of that action, beside all the rest of the popish prelates, which then were of that parliament, for information whereof that conference was appointed.</q> I say let the reader iudge, whether hee haue not deserued those termes, that being but a man of verie meane learning, as his writinges declare, was not ashamed to call all the nobilities and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons of the parliament, lay lorde<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Againe, pag. 58. I call Bristowe a traiterous Papist, because he slaundereth our state not onely for publike execution of open rebelles and errant traytours, as the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2866:328" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Earle of Northumberlande, Storie, Felton, Nortons, Woodhouse, and so many hundreths of the northeren men, whom all hee calleth holy martyres, prooued by miracles vndoubted, but also with priuie murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by poysoning, whipping, and famishing, what lesse I could haue sayde of him for this hygh treason openly printed, and what an honest Papist the censurer is for reproouing me in so terming him, I refer to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Christian and faithfull subiectes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>To proceede I call him shamelesse beast pag. 18. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he maketh a shamlesse and beastly conclusion in those wordes: Whosoeuer haue at any time, set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues against any doctrine confirmed by miracle, they haue beene against the trueth. There can to this no instance bee giuen: our doctrine which they resist hath beene confirmed by miracles, therefore playne it is that they are enemies of the trueth. Doe you not heare this shamelesse beast say (quod I) there can be no instance giuen against his proposition, when the Lorde himselfe giueth an expresse lawe against a false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, which sheweth signes and miracles?</q> Deut. 13. &amp;c. Weigh the terme with the desert of the person in this bolde assertion, and if it bee too extreme, I desire no fauour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Yet againe pag. 10. I write thus: Where Luther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth that the mockers of the true Church were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called heretikes, his conscience did not accuse him (as Bristowe sayde of him) that his side were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes. For hee was able to put a difference betweene him that by heretikes is called an heretike, and him that is so indeede: although Bristowe, either for his blockish wit cannot, or for his spitefull malice will not conceiue it.</q> Heere I doe not simply accuse his wit, but either his wit or his malice: and that one of them was to blame, if not both, euery wise man may see by his argument.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, pag. 39. I say, he is an impudent asse,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:2866:328"/>
which to stablish his grounde of custome, is not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to falsifie the wordes of holy scripture. For hee had said, that Saint Paul after many reasons 1. Cor. 11. for the vncomlinesse of womens going bareheaded, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyleth to this inuincible fort: <hi>Si quis &amp;c.</hi> But if any man seeme to be contentious, we haue no such custom (for women to pray vncouered) nor the church of God. His ignorance and impudence is manifest in this place. If the terme asse offende any man, let him consider that nothing but an ignorant person is noted thereby, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so pag. 88. where hee is called a blinde bayarde and blockheaded asse, because he disdainefully vpbraydeth all our doctors, and vniuersities of much ignoraunce, and lacke of learning, and Caluine he sayth erred about the trinitie through ignorance, with such odious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons, as in so vaine and vnlearned a fellowe, as Bristowe sheweth himselfe to be, is intollerable.</p>
                  <p>To note his bolde ignorance also I sayd pag. 74. <q>The more beastly is the blundring of this Bristowe, who dreameth that the councell of Constantinople the first, which made this confession by the Apostolike Church, did not onely meane the Romaine Church, but also none other but the Romaine church: whereas the councell knowing well the catholike church of the worlde,</q> from the particular Church of Rome, gaue like priuiledges of honor to the Church of Constantinople to those which Rome had, reseruing onely senioritie to old Rome: beside many other reasons, they alleadged to prooue, that they acknowledged no such authoritie of the Church at Rome, as the papistes nowe defende.</p>
                  <p>Likewise pag. 89. I call him blundring Bristowe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for charging M. Iewell with ignoraunce, for affirming Christ to be a priest according to his deitie, of which as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion I shal haue occasion to speake afterward against the last slander.</p>
                  <p>And pag. 75. where Bristowe sayth, that in all inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations both great and small that euer by heretikes
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2866:329" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were attempted, they can shewe vnder what pope they chanced, what tumultes rising in the world there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what doctors withstande it, what councels accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it, &amp;c. I reply thus: <q>What an impudent lyer is this Bristowe, to bragge of that, which at this day is vnpos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to be done, by any man liuing in the worlde? For of so many heretikes as are rehearsed by Epiphanius and Augustine, not the one halfe of them can bee so shewed, as Bristowe like a blinde bayarde boasteth they can doe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Yet more touching his ignorance pag. 43. I say Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome was not so grosse, to count walking about the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to be a peregrination. But what is so leaden or blockish, which these doltish papistes will not aduouch for the mainteinance of their trumperie?</q> This I write because Bristowe would haue Hierome, by often ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into the cryptes or vaultes of the Churches at Rome, to signifie, that he went on pilgrimage. Where the collector of the phrases doeth me some wrong, to say I call Bristowe leaden, blockish, and doltish Papist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where I say those doltish papistes which auouch any thing, neuer so leaden or blockish. Onely I require the indifferent reader to consider whether I haue iust cause to charge him with ignorance and impudence: as for the termes, I will not stande, either to iustifie them, or to reuoke them, but referre them to euery reasonable mans censure.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore pag. 48. I say that proude scoffe, of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament religion, (which Bristowe vseth) bewrayeth the stomacke of a vanteparler, and not the spirite of a diuine, or good subiect. Heare I thinke the terme of vantparler, was too milde for such a knowne trayterous Papist, as commendeth open rebelles for martyres, as affirmeth that the Queenes subiectes are lawfully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of the othe of obedience giuen to her maiestie, as derideth the religion established by parliament pag. 51. I say, the Papistes like impudent dogges, yelpe and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2866:329"/>
barke against vs, that the fathers are all on their side, because they haue sucked out of their writinges, a fewe dregges of a great quantitie of good liquor conteined in their vessels, hauing the fathers in the most and greatest matters wholly against them. And pag. 55. I say that Bristowe quarelling with D. Humfrey, yelpeth like a litle curre, against a great lion, and snatching pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his sentences, gnawen from the rest, squeleth out as though hee had hearde some meruelous straunge soundes, &amp;c. If this allegorie be too base for Bristowes dignitie, let him humble himselfe and craue pardon of his treasons, for I will doe no reuerence to a traytour, that openly bewrayeth himselfe in a printed booke, as he and other of his complices haue doone. A proude hypocrite priest, of stinking, greasie, antichristian and execrable orders, I cannot finde where I haue termed him, except I should reade ouer the whole booke: but if I haue vsed such speeches, I thinke they are no woorse than his wicked behauiour, &amp; popish sacrificing priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode deserue to haue. Blasphemous heretike he giueth mee often occasion to call him, and namely pag. 81. where I reprooue him for calling the blessed sacrament his Lorde and God, which although transubstantiation were graunted, yet because the Papistes affirme, that this sacrament consisteth of accidentes, as the signe or externall part thereof, seeing accidentes are neither God nor in God, it could not be saide, without blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, that the sacramentis Lorde and God.</p>
                  <p>Next followe reprochfull termes vsed against Allen. The first, brasen face and yron foreheade, I doe not yet finde: but it signifieth nothing but notable impudence, which is noted pag. 23. where I call him impudent blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer because he had sayde of vs: <q>That to such as make no store of good workes, they cast onely faith vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their elbowes to leane vpon: where as none of vs did euer teach that such a faith as is not liuely &amp; fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of good workes,</q> did euer profite any man but to the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:2866:330"/>
encrease of his damnation.</p>
                  <p>Againe pag. 24. <q>I note him to passe impudencie it self in shamelesse lying, where he sayth: Commit what you lyst, omit what you list, your preachers shall praise it in their wordes, and practise it in their workes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Also pag. 147. I charge him with an impudent lye, where he saieth, that M. Caluine doeth expounde the oyle whereof Saint Iames speaketh cap. 5. for a medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable salue or oyntment, to ease the sicke mans sore, when it is manifest, that Caluine vtterly reiecteth and confuteth that exposition. Likewise pag. 259. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince him of impudent lying, because he doth wilfully falsifie the decrees of two councels at a clappe, saying they excommunicate all such as in any wise hinder the oblations for the departed, when both the councelles Vase, and Carthage speak of them that detaine the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations or bequestes of the dead giuen to the church for the vse of the poore. These and many like shamelesse assertion<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Where this impudent marchant Allen had rayled intollerably against the reuerende father M. Iewell, calling him the English bragger, one that in summer games might winne two games of cracking &amp; lying, with like shamelesse stuffe: <q>I sayde and doe not a whitrepent me: Howe M.

of other countryes. Erasmus sayde that onely Englande had learned Bishoppes. Likewise I say that Allen rayleth like a ruffian at our ministers in the ruffe of their newe communion. pag. 259. The terme of scornefull caytife, I finde not, but well he deserueth it, by deryding and scoffing at such godly learned and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable fathers, as you may perceiue by that which I haue noted in him against the Bishops of Salisbury and Durisme, which is not yet the 40. part of his proude mockes and disdainefull gibes.</p>
                  <p>Desperate dicke I finde pag. 371. where Allen had picked a quarell to M. Pilkington of Durisme, as hee calleth him in his margent, scoffing at him in his text, that he was ashamed of his name, and therefore should loose the glorie of his assertion, &amp;c. I aunswered: you would faine haue such a man to be your aduersarie, that though you tooke the foyle, yet you might boast, that you were so bolde as to fight with him. But it is an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier matter for such a desperate dicke to beginne a fraie than to ende it.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 97. where Allen saide, that Dauid seeketh to be better cleansed than by remission of sinnes only, and to haue his sinnes wholly blotted out, and to be made as white as snowe, by his owne suffering, which was not doone by Gods mercifull pardon in the sprinkeling of the bloude of Christ, I could not forbeare, but crie out, O horrible blasphemer. Likewise pag. 298. where hee challengeth to the popish clergy, the priesthoode after the order of Melchisedeck confirmed by an othe Psal. 110. which is peculiar onely to our sauiour Christ, I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it more horrible blasphemy, than euer turke or Iewe durst presume to boast of.</p>
                  <p>Also pag. 240. where we affirme, that mens workes must not presume to win heauen, nay to purge sinnes, nor to meddle with Christes worke of redemption and the office of onely fayth, which assertions Allen calleth corruptions of Christian co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions, I say, it is a blaspho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2866:331"/>
barking of an horrible hell hounde. And I thinke I haue sayde nothing more hardely, than such a deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish blasphemy deserueth to heare.</p>
                  <p>But leauing Allen, let vs come to Stapleton, where he sayeth, our preachers haue a newe tricke, <q>to make the audience crie, Amen. But to teares, to lamenting or bewailing of their sinnes, no Protestant yet moueth his audience, (which is such a lie, as the diuell in his owne person for his credites sake would bee ashamed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce) I say it is an olde tricke of a cancred stomac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Papist. page 112.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To proceede, page 110. &amp; 111. where Stapleton had alledged, that which Eusebius speaketh of a heauenly crowne of glorie the ornament of Gods friends and priests, to proue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> antiquitie of Popish shauen crownes: I thought I had good reason to say, he is worthie to bee shorne on his poll with a number of crownes, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth this of a shauen crowne. And I aske if there be any blocke so senselesse, to thinke that Eusebius cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a shauen head, the heauenly crowne of glorie?</p>
                  <p>Page 98. I sayd: They had in the first 600. yeres men that liued a solitarie life called <hi>Monachi, Anachoritae, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remitae, &amp;c.</hi> but no more like our Popish boares, liuing in their frankes, than Angels are like diuels, noting the Epicurian markes of these last times.</p>
                  <p>Also page 103. where Stapleton had cited a falsified Canon of the Nicen Councell, confuted by the Greeke copies and the right translation of the Latine, by Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finus, by Peter Crabs confession. I conclude, But such draffe and dregges of falsifications, additions, detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, mutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp;c. are good ynough for popish swine.</p>
                  <p>Page 79. where he complaineth, that Protestants haue taken away Aucthoritie of making that which Christ bad them to make, in his last supper. I answere. <q>If you say you make the bodie of Christ, in such sense, as you affirme he sacrament to bee the bodie of Christ, Gods cursse light on you. For to say, they can make
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:2866:331"/>
the naturall bodie of Christ it is blasphemie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are to be accursed. Otherwise I saide, The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all that which Christ commaunded to be done in remembrance of him,</q> (which Hierome calleth making the bodie of Christ meaning the sacrament of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die) we take not away.</p>
                  <p>The terme of brasen faced Stapleton, I finde not, but notable impudencie proued by him in sundrie places. As page 28. where he is noted for charging the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants to say: That these 900. yeares and vpwarde the church hath perished, it hath beene ouerwhelmed with idolatrie and superstition, <q>which is a lowd impudently, for the Protestants neuer saide so. Againe, page 39. where he is reproued for affirming Caluin to teach,</q> that God is the cause and author of euill, which blasphemie Caluine alwayes abhorreth and confuteth. Also page 40. he is conuicted of manie impudent slaunders. And page 46. where he sayeth the Protestants commonly call S. Gregorie that Antichrist, which I knowe not whether to impute it to impudence or madnes. These fewe examples among a great number, doe prooue that he deserueth the epithets of brasen faced or impudent Stapleton.</p>
                  <p>Page 77. I call him blockheaded papist, hauing often before detected his grosse ignorance, because hee scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth at M. Haddon, as though he alledged prescription of 30. yeares continuance, except sixe of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants doctrine: whereas the Papistes as he saith haue 900. yeares.</p>
                  <p>Page 75. thus I write: <q>The myracles reported by M. Foxe, the shameles beast when he cannot deny, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing testified by witnesses aboue all exception hee can make, affirmeth to be esteemed of his own fellowes but as ciuill things, and such as may happen by course of reason. I say not this as though I would haue our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to be credited one iote more, for any such mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, but to shewe the shameles dogged stomacke of this
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2866:332"/>
Popish slaunderer, which when he had none other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to make, as concerning such miracles, forgeth that wee our selues denie all such to haue beene mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which he is not able to prooue, although he would burst for malice against the truth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The terme of grosse and beastly ignorance, although I finde not, yet I thinke I haue vsed, as I had often oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, whereof I will note one, that page 99. To proue the antiquitie of Augustine fryers, he translateth in S. Augustine <hi>frater</hi> a fryer, whereras that order began more than a 1000. yeares after S. Augustine, Anno Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini 1406.</p>
                  <p>Finally, page 43. where he wil proue that the church of the Iewes neuer erred, because the high priestes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered truelie of the natiuitie of Christ, and because Cayphas prophecied vnwittingly of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vertue of Christs death, I say there can be nothing more blockish, than such kinde of reasoning. Againe, where he sayeth, the whole synagogue, before the lawe of Christ tooke place, in necessarie knowledge of the lawe did neuer erre. For proofe of this (saide I) more like a blocke than a man, he bringeth such places of Scripture, as either shewe what the priestes duetie should be, but affirme not what their knowledge was, <q>or else prophecie a reformation of the corrupt state of the clergie from ignorance to knowledge. Last of all, I say, what drunken flemming of Doway would reason thus (as Stapleton doeth?) The Scribes and the Pharisees sate in Moses chaire, therfore the Synagogue did neuer, or not then erre. Whereas the false doctrine of the Scribes and Pharisees, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning adulterie, murther, swearing, the worship of God, not onely the person but also the qualitie of Messias &amp; his kingdome, our Sauiour Christ him selfe so often and so sharply doeth reproue.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus haue I set downe the occasions of as many of these speaches as I could finde, except I should haue read ouer the whole bookes, that the indifferent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:2866:332"/>
may see, when they be in their proper places, they sound not so hardly, to prooue mee a rayler, as they seeme for the most part, by extreme malice, impudence, ignorance, vngodlines, disdainfulnes of the aduersaries to haue beene rather wrested from mee, than of any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable affection vttered by mee. But in common ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilitie, as our stately Censurer iudgeth, I should haue forborne these learned and reuerend men, which in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie respects to say the least, may be counted my equals: seeing these or the like termes, were not vsed amongst the Gentiles, nor of any honest or Christian writer since. I answere, ciuilitie is to be vsed with citizens, but not with traytors: learning and other good qualities to be respected in Christian Catholikes, or at the leastwise in them that are no professed enimies of Christian Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike religion, not in malicious heretikes. For equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie in learning I will not contende with them, but for superioritie in trueth. And yet as vnlearned as I am, let the proudest of them all, or this Censurer, whome in pride and disdainfulnes I thinke to passe them all, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint mee of such ignorance, as I conuince these lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned principall pillers of Poperie, in their seuerall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bookes, in so manie books as I haue written against them: and then let mee iustly beare the reproche that I shall be proued to deserue. Where he saith these termes were not vsed among the Gentiles, (I will adde with approbation of Christians) nor of any honest or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian writer since: his penne runneth before his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, if he haue read: or before his wit and modestie, if he haue not read, what both Gentiles against tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, and Christians against heretikes and traytours haue written. And if this issue might bee tryed in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, I would not doubt but make his blushing coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance bewray his guiltie conscience. But of this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters scurrilitie against manie men, he saith he might repeate a great deale more. I would hee might come foorth, and shewe what bull hee hath, to rayle, and vse
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2866:333"/>
scurrilitie against all men, and yet condemne whome it pleaseth him of rayling scurrilitie. But because this minister answereth many men forsooth, one saide well of him, that he is the common posthorse of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, to passe you any answere without a baite, against any Catholike booke which commeth in his way. This is euen as good, as because this Censurer slaundereth manie men, another might say of him, he is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon packhorse of the Papistes, to carrie any fardell of lyes deuised against any Christian man or booke that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in his way, and the rather because he weareth a paire of winkers ouer his eyes like a milhorse, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to shewe either his face or his name. And more truely than of mee, for (with what speede soeuer) I passe no mans answere but mine owne: where as hee taketh vp the bundell of slanders, deuised by Staphylus, Eccius, Cocleus, Lindanus, Bolsec, and a number of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beside. But mine answeres are not passed in such hast as the replyes are returned with laisure, it seemeth the beastes that should bring them, are afraide of stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. Yet Martials epithetes remaine to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, who being a person so vile and absurde, to rayle so vnmeasurably and continually against that godly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man M. doctor Calfhil of learned and Christian memorie, I was bolde in my Reioynder against him, to handle in part, according to his vertues.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning, which is page 121. of the volume, in consideration of his intollerable ignorance, arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie &amp; impudencie, which appeareth throughout all his booke, I say that whereas he termeth himselfe to bee a bachiler of the lawe, he is more like a wrangling petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fogger in the lawe, than a sober student in diuinitie, which also he professeth to be, for he doth in a manner nothing else but cauil, quarel, and scolde. Likewise in the verie ende of my booke, exhorting the Papistes for their credits sake, to make out a better champion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, I tell them as the trueth is, that in this his replie,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2866:333"/>
he doth nothing in a maner but either construe like an Vsher, (as he was sometimes of Winchester schoole) or quarell like a dogbolt lawyer. To the same purpose, page 128. where master Calfehil said: If an Angel from heauen teache otherwise than the Apostles haue prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnto vs, be he accursed: Martiall the quarelling lawyer findeth fault with his translation, because <hi>Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelizamus</hi> may be referred, as well to the disciples as to the Apostles, so that the disciples preaching are to bee credited as well as the Apostles. <q>No doubt (say I) if they preach the doctrine of the Apostles, of which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie is, and not of the persons that preached. But these quarels sir Bachiler, are more meete for the bum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courts, where perhaps you are a prating proctor, than for the schooles of diuinitie. In this saying, if the terme of bumcourts seeme too light, I yeeld vnto the censure of graue and godly men.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Page 138. where Martiall citeth Constantinus for the commendation of his crosse, I say, he sheweth him selfe an egregious ignorant person. For the signe which the Emperour commended to be a healthfull signe and true token of vertue, was the name of Christ, expressed in the Charecter which he sawe. And page 154. where he maketh this syllogisme to prooue that in time of the Eliberin Councell, pictures were worshipped, which he sayeth, followeth necessarily vpon the words of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non thus: That was worshipped that was forbidden to be painted on the walles: but pictures were forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to be painted on the walles, <hi>ergo</hi> pictures were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped. Answere master Calfe. Hereunto I reioyne. Who would haue thought that an vsher of Winchester and student in Louaine that teacheth vs (as he said) an olde lawyers point, would also teach vs a newe Logike point, to conclude affirmatiuely in the second figure, &amp; that all vpon particulars? Answere master Calfe, quod Martiall. Nay aunswere goose to such an argument. And reason who will with such an asse any longer about
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2866:334"/>
this matter, for I will hearken to his law, seeing his Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gike is no better.</p>
                  <p>If sir Censurer will defende this syllogisme, &amp; prooue it to be good and lawfull, I will reuoke my termes.</p>
                  <p>Page 142. where he sayeth, that bread and wine of the sacrament haue no promise, I tell him he lyeth like an arrogant hypocrite, for bread and wine haue as good promise in the one sacrament as water in the other.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 178. where M. Calfebill had distinguished tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions into some necessarie, some contrary to the worde, some indifferent: I say Martiall like an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent asse, calleth on him to shewe in what scripture, doctor, or councell he findeth this distinction of tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. As though a man might not make a true distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in disputation, but the same must bee founde in so many wordes, in scripture, doctor, or councell, when he himselfe cannot denie, but the distinction is true, and euery part to be founde in the scriptures, doctors, and councelles.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 133. I call Martiall blockeheade and shamelesse asse, because he would proue, that the spirite of God is not iudge of the interpretation of the scriptures: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Paule and Barnabas in the controuersie of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, went not to the worde and spirit, but to the Apostles, and elders at Ierusalem.</p>
                  <p>Also pag. 213. I call him asseheade, because he sayth that M. Calfehill condemneth his doctrine of only faith iustifying, when he affirmeth that outwarde profession is necessarie for euery Christian man.</p>
                  <p>Likewise pag. 215. where Martiall would learne whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther M. Calfehill kneeling downe before his father to aske him blessing, did not commit Idolatrie? I say hee is an asse that can not make a difference betweene ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill honour and religious worship.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 202. I call not onely Martiall, but all Papistes shamelesse dogges and blasphemous Idolaters, which mainetaine, and make vowes to Images, which trauell
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2866:334"/>
to them, and offer vp both prayers and sacrifices, of candels, money, Iewels, and other thinges vnto Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Whose Idolles haue giuen answeres, haue wagged their heades and lippes.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 198. I say he rayleth vpon Caluine, like a ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and slandereth him like a deuill, because hee sayeth a shippe would not carrie the peeces of the crosse that are shewed in so many places, which yet is confirmed by testimonie of Erasmus.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 170. where Martiall goeth about to proove that the sacramentes are no helpes of our fayth, I said, Did you euer heare such a filthy hogge grunt so beastly, of the holie sacramentes, that they should be no helpes of our faith?</p>
                  <p>These are as many of the speeches noted by the censurer, as I can finde, wherein I trust the indifferent reader, weighing vpon what cause they were vttered, will not so lightly condemne me for a rayler, seeing to rayle is of priuate malice to reuile them, that deserue no reproch, and not of zeale in defence of truth, to vse vehement and sharpe speeches, as all the prophets, and the mildest spirited men that euer were haue vsed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the aduersaries thereof. But the most heynous accusation is behinde, that I call Staphylus a counsellor to an Emperour rascall. I might answere as S. Paul did, when hee was reprooued for calling the high priest, painted wall: Brethren, I knewe not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors counsellor: or in very deede, I know nothing in him worthy to be an honest mans counsellour. But seeing it pleased an Emperour to accept him, it is as great a fault, as if an enemie of meane condition, should call an English counsellour, rascall. So sayth our sharpe cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer. But if he meane those that be of the Queenes maiesties priuie counsell, I will not say he playeth the rascall, but either the ignorant foole, or the malicious vile person to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Apostata Staphylus, euen in his counsellership, with the meanest of their honors. For
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2866:335"/>
they that knowe the maner of the princes of Germanie and of other foreine princes can testifie, that persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of meane estate, only being learned in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawes, are accepted of the Emperour and other states, as their counsellours, whose counsell perhapes they neuer vse, but may if it please them, as of counsellors at lawe. So that one man is counseller to the Emperour, and to many other princes. As for example, Lutolphus Schra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derus doctor of both lawes, was ordinary professor in the Vniuersitie of Frankeforde, and counsellour of the Emperor, of the Elector, &amp; Marquis of Brandeburge, of the dukes of Brunswich, Luneburge, Megelburge, and of many other princes of Germanie. This was a very great and wise man, but Cassanaeus <hi>in Cat. glor. <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>di, part.</hi> 10. <hi>Consid.</hi> 41. sayth, that euery simple aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate did vse to call him selfe the kinges counseller of Fraunce, before order was taken, that none should v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpe that title, except he were called vnto some office in the courtes. And speaking of such as were counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in office, in his time, of whose dignity hee writeth much, he complayneth that they were promoted vnto that dignitie in parliamentes, by meanes of money, or some other vnknowen meanes <hi>part.</hi> 7. <hi>Conf.</hi> 13. Such a noble counseller was Staphylus, hauing some know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the lawes, being preferred to that title by the Papists of fauour more than of worthinesse to giue him some shadowe of countenaunce, when hee became an Apostata from true religion, and from those Christian princes and noble men, by whom he was before vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. And yet in trueth, if the printer had not mistaken my writing, I called him Renegate and not rascall, as before I called him beastly Apostata. Perhaps the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer will say, I mende the matter well to call an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors counseller, a beastly Apostata. But so might I haue done, though he had beene an Emperour himselfe, for what else was Iulian the Emperor but a beastly Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta or Renegate from Christian religion which once he
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2866:335"/>
professed? Yea such an Apostata is worse than a beast, for he declareth himselfe thereby to bee a reprobate. Therefore the Christians in his time, whereas the church had alwayes vsed to pray for heathen tyrantes, that helde the empyre, and made hauocke of the church by persecution, contrariwise prayed against this Apostata, that God would confound him and shorten his time. Yea the godly constant Bishops, did openly inueigh against him, as Mares Bishop of Chalcedon, which openly called him impious, Atheist &amp; Apostata. And when Iulian counterfaiting mildenes did nothing but reuile him by his blindenesse, saying the Galilean thy God cannot cure thee, he answered, I thanke my<note place="margin">Trip. hist. li. 6. Cap. 6.</note> God Christ, that I am blinde, that I might not see one so voyde of godlinesse as thou art. Therefore Staphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus being but an Emperours counseller, as he was, <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>y endure to heare worse for his Apostasie, than I haue spoken against him.</p>
                  <p>The quarell of wordes being ended, it is time to goe to the matter. First pag. 14. of his aunswer to Maister Charkes preface, he noteth that D. Fulke against Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowes Mot. pa. 98. findeth, that it is euident by scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that heretikes may bee burned, against Luther. That blasphemous heretikes are to be put to death, I finde in scripture, by the lawe of blasphemers Leu. 24. and by the lawe of false prophetes Deut. 13. neither doth Luther (I thinke) denie, but the equitie of the same lawes doth still remaine, although not euery one that erreth obstinately, ought to bee delt with so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely. Also pag. 82. of that booke I say, that all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantes are one in God and Christ, their redeemer, from which vnitie, dissention about ceremonies can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not separate them: and yet I except such schismatikes as delight in contention. The controuersie betweene Luther and vs, doth not hinder vs from this vnitie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Luther and other of preposterous zeale of godlinesse, do otherwise account of vs, which errour is
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:2866:336"/>

                  <p>The pag. 23. of the same aunswere, there is another charge where I say: that text, Vow ye and render your vowes to the Lorde, is a text that pertaineth to the old Testament, meaning that it must haue the exposition according to the lawe, of such thinges as God did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe and were in mens power to perfourme. For what if a man vowed to sacrifice a dogge? What say wee to Iepthes rash vowe? To the vowe of them that vowed to kill Paul? Our censurer reporteth my wordes, <q>that this text belongeth onely to the olde Testament, as though I sayde, there was no vse of it in the newe Testament.</q> There is one lie by addition. In the same place to the text, If thou wilt bee perfect, goe and s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> cauileth, that so all the other wordes spoken to that young man, may be restrained and made singular, as whatsoeuer else was spoken to any singular person. As though my reason were, that therefore it was singular, because it was spoken to one man. As if wee had not generall lawes and rules to knowe what is enioyned to all men, what to some men, and what to a singular person. In the next pag. 24. hee quarelleth at my expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the saying of S. Iames cap. 2. that a man is iustified of workes, and not of faith onely. Where I say, workes, are not denyed to iustifie before men, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith without workes, is thought to iustifie before God, Rom. 3. This he calleth a poore deuise, because Saint Iames talking of faith without workes, sayth it cannot saue a man. Nay rather this is a poore cauill. For S. Iames talketh of another kinde of faith, as well as of an other kind of iustification, when his saying see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be contradictory to Saint Paule. And that in the place in question hee meaneth iustification before men as in the other place a fayth voyde of good works, it is manifest, both by his owne wordes: <hi>Shewe me thy</hi>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:2866:336"/>
                     <hi>faith by thy workes,</hi> and also by the example of Abrahams tryall, which was not to enforme God of his iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but to giue testimony before men.</p>
                  <p>Pag. 25. to shewe how protestants deny all fathers, he bringeth me for an example in many places. First he sayth, the consent of ancient fathers is alleaged, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing superioritie to Peter, vpon that text Math. 16. <hi>Thou art Peter, &amp;c.</hi> This he sayth I auoyde very lightly, saying that diuerse of the auncient fathers were decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in opinion of Peters prerogatiue. As for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of all, which he would seeme to make for it, is false: but this is not all mine answere, but that this preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue appeareth not in the scriptures, which was heuier than the answerers penne could beare: or if he thinke it doeth, let him prooue by syllogisme out of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures if he can. But vntill he can, I will say this is a lie by detraction.</p>
                  <p>Secondly where I say, those ancient fathers that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde<note place="margin">Against the Rocke p. 291</note> the text Iohn 5. <hi>I came in my fathers name, &amp;c.</hi> of antichrist, haue no grounde of their exposition. I proue it by example of Theudas, the Aegyptian, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabus, and other that deceiued the Iewes in their owne name, yet none of them was antichrist.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly where he sayth, Ierome with all the ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall writers, are alleaged for the interpretation of the wordes of Daniel cap. 7. which interpretation I do not admit, because it hath no direction out of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, hee maketh a lie by multiplication: for onely Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, with such ecclesiasticall writers out of whom he gathered his interpretation, is alleaged.</p>

God sayth vnto Ezechias, I will defende this citie, for mine owne cause, and for Dauid my seruantes sake. Alas good man, what maner of reason is this? Be it as he sayth, that the memorie of Dauid being a righteous man, and not rather the truth of Gods promise made to Dauid, moued him to defend the citie from the enemies: doth it therefore followe that prayer and almes are auayleable for the dead?</q> &amp;c.

To his proude challenge, I offer not onely this that I haue saide, of the error of praying for the dead, and Purgatorie, but of some partes of the heresie of the Pelagians, condemned in olde time, and accused for heresie: reuiued by the Papistes, and the contrarie doctrine by them accursed.

For whereas in publike writing, both he and some other of his complices haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed their reuerent opinion of her maiesties singular vertues, and other of high estate, that are vnder her, in his familiar letter to his worshipful friend, he condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all persons of this time, to be voide of all sense of vertuous life, except these few popish gentlemen, which he tearmeth precise in matters of religion, and respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue of their conscience, whom he doth so ambitiously commend, that he doth most slaunderously condemne all other, that be friendes to religion and the state, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whome there be (God he praised) great numbers to speake nothing of the prince and nobilitie, who in

If this were true, it would make a more mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable estate of Englande, than you before imagined, by imprisonment of a fewe good housekeepers. And I would heartily wish that you falsely say of all, might not be verified of some. But that there is no sense or feeling of vertue, but all men enwrapped in the loue of Gods professed enemie, and that in so extreeme a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: except a small number of obstinately and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully blinded Papistes, that is more than euer could be iustly sayde, almost of any Heathenish or Turkish state, in which the sense or feeling of vertue, was neuer so wholy extinguished, but some remained euen in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that knewe not God nor serued him aright, &amp;c.</q>

Wherefore let men of vnderstanding iudge, whether he in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatorie epistle, or I in this reproofe of his familiar letter, haue flattered so palpably: and whether in this reply I haue played the parasite, or the censurer in this malignant slander, the shamelesse sycophant. But let vs heare what reason he hath to conuince mee of flatterie. <hi>When men accuse the times</hi> (sayth he) <hi>must they except Princes by name or else be accounted traytors?</hi> As though Howlet accuseth the times onely and not the persons also. Yea all men except the recusantes, are with him vtterly voyde of all sense of vertue, and in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2866:340"/>
worse case also. But why say you, men must be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted traytors? I accused Howlet but of dissimulation, and flatterie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but belike you acknowledge such slaunder more meete to discry an heynous traytour, than a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling flatterer. I doe not altogether mislike your censure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> although for that matter my purpose was not to accuse him so deepely. But you proceede and aske, <hi>What Apostle, what auncient fathers did euer so?</hi> And I will aske you againe, what Apostle, what ancient father, did euer in publike writing professe his reuerent opinion of any princes singular vertues and of other of high estate vnder him, and yet neuerthelesse in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar letter, condemne the whole state of that princes gouernement (as Howlet doeth) excepting no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but such as are disobedient subiectes, and the princes, either priuie or professed enemies? Beside that the comparison is verie odious, betweene an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle and an Howlet, a publike trumpet sounding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sinne, and a birde of the night schriching in a secret and familiar letter. And if you will say, it was not meant, that the letter should be priuate, but publike, as I can easily beleeue you, if you doe affirme it: I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that such Howlets come not from Athens, as can no better obserue the measure and comelinesse of the person they pretende to be.

Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be graunted that Saint Ierome here speaketh of our common Creede,</q> yet it followeth not, that hee affirmeth it to bee made by the Apostles, which it is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, that it is receiued of the doctrine of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. Ruffinus in deede, <hi>expositione in symbolum,</hi> sayeth it was an opinion receiued from the elders, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles before their dispersion made this briefe forme of beliefe, which is called their Creede. And I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the opinion hath some probabilitie, but that it is to be beleeued of necessitie of saluation, neither Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus sayeth, nor if he did were he able to prooue it. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose, Ep. 81. <hi>Syricio,</hi> to prooue that Marie in the birth of Christ was a virgine, sayeth: <hi>Credatur symbolo Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stòlorum quod Ecclesia Romana iteratum semper custodit &amp; seruat.</hi> Let credit bee giuen to the Apostles Creede, which being repeted often, the Church of Rome doth
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:2866:343"/>
alwayes keepe and obserue. That this Creede is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Apostles symbole or Creede, it may well be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it containeth the summe of the Apostles doctrine although it had not beene compiled by them. The te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie of Augustine, which you quote Serm. 118. <hi>De tempore,</hi> must needes be some yonger mans, because he repeteth the verie wordes of Ruffinus. which Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine liuing almost in his time, woulde not repete as his owne. You might as well, and more for your purpose haue quoted Serm. 115. <hi>De tempore,</hi> where euery Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle maketh an Article, which is the absurde opinion of the late Papistes, but neuer was credited by Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine himselfe, howsoeuer these sermons haue gotten vnder the shadow of his name. To conclude, as some of the auncient fathers thinke the Creede was of the Apostles making, so none of them affirmeth, that it is damnable to doubt thereof, so a man doubt not of the doctrine contained therein, whereof the holy ghost is author, as it is proued by the holie scriptures, whether the Apostles or their successours did gather this short summe or forme of beliefe, which we call the Apostles Creede.</p>
                  <p>For the obseruation of the Easter day, which is the seconde point wherein you dare Master Charke, I dare affirme, that seeing it is not commaunded in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the obseruation thereof is not necessarie to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That Eusebius calleth it an Apostolike tradition, it is not materiall, seeing that verie contention, which he reporteth was about the obseruation of Easter, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apostolike tradition, by the immediate successors of the Apostles, Anicetus and Polycarpus doe plainly testifie, what credit is to bee giuen to the traditions of the Apostles without the warrant of the Apostles writings. Euseb. lib. 5. Cap. 26. For while A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicetus pretendeth the tradition of S. Peter, and Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carpus S. Iohn, and neither would yeelde to other, they teache vs what to esteeme of traditions apostolical, not
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2866:343"/>
contained in the holy scriptures: Namely, that in these dayes there can bee no certeintie of them, when they which might see and heare the Apostles themselues, could not agree about them. Last of all, which you make the greatest matter, the perpetuall virginitie of the mother of Christ after his birth, although for my part I do beleeue it, and wish all men so to doe, yet dare I affirme, that it is not damnable, not to beleeue it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it can be prooued, that the scripture hath taught it. But you obiect against mee, first the condemnation of Heluidius, testified by Sozomenus. Whereto I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that he was iustly condemned, not because he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued not, but because he did obstinately denie it, &amp; troubled the peace of the church, about an vnnecessary question.</p>
                  <p>But you aske vs, if wee remember not the solemne curse for this matter, of so many holy bishops recorded and confirmed by S. Ambrose. Ep. 81. &amp; 79. It seemeth you remember it not your selfe, for that curse contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the ende of the Ep. 81. was against them that like Manichees, denyed that our Sauiour Christ tooke flesh of a virgine. And Ep. 79. he reprooueth them which did contende, that the virgine Marie had more sonnes than our Sauiour Christ, which to affirme is a great errour: and conuinced by the authoritie of the scripture, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Ambrose well noteth, our Sauiour Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his mother to Iohn the Euangelist, which had not beene needefull, if shee had naturall sonnes of her owne, which might take care of her.</p>
                  <p>But you will stoppe our mouthes if you can, (as you say) with these wordes of Saint Augustine, <hi>Integra fide credendum est, &amp;c.</hi> 
                     <q>Wee must beleeue with a sounde faith blessed Marie the mother of Christ to haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in virginitie, to haue brought foorth her sonne in virginitie,</q> and to haue remained a virgine after her childbirth, neither must wee yeeld to the blasphemie of Heluidius. Your author goeth on and telleth, what
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:2866:344"/>
that was. <hi>Qui dixis, fuit virgo ante partum, non virgo post partum.</hi> Who sayd, shee was a virgine before her child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, shee was no virgine after her childbirth. But where shall wee finde this saying in Saint Augustine? Your quotation directeth vs to Augustine <hi>in Encherid.</hi> Cap. 34. where in deede some mention is of Maries virginitie, namely, that she conceiued in virginitie, but nothing of Heluidius or his heresie. Wherefore it sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that out of Canisius, or some other mans collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, your common places of the doctors sayings are bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed, and not taken out of your owne reading. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore howsoeuer you haue mistaken the matter, the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you alledge is in the bastarde booke <hi>De dogmatibus Ecclesiasticis, Cap.</hi> 69. which may as easily be knowen from Augustines writing, as a goose from a swanne. And yet if it were of as good authoritie as Augustines owne wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, it were not sufficient to stop our mouth, when wee heare that wee are slaundered. For wee dare not say, with Heluidius, (which is the blasphemie noted by that writer) that the virgine Marie was no virgine after her childbirth, although wee say, that it is no article of faith, necessarie to saluation, except it haue demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of the holy scriptures: neither doth your author say, it is blasphemie to doubt of it, but to denye it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though for my part I do neither denie it, nor doubt of it, but beleeue it as I do manie other truethes, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the scripture, but yet not as articles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian faith necessarie to saluation. I will conclude with a saying of Saint Ierome, and stoppe your mouth if I can, which concerning this verie question in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie against Heluidius, to shewe what a man is bound to beleeue vpon necessitie of saluation, euen that which is contained in the scriptures: and that which is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Thirdly, he maketh not the doubting thereof to be blasphemie, but the obstinate denying of Heluidius, which saide shee was no virgine after her childbirth. But how will you auoide that which S.

                  <p>Pag. 158. you do not see why you should beleeue a Charke or a Fulke, comming but yester day from the grammar schole, before a Cyprian, a Tertullian, a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil, a Ierom, an Ambrose, or an Augustine, especially in a matter of fact (as your case is) seeing they liued more than twelue or thirteene hundred yeares nearer to the deede dooing than these ministers do. Why sir, I pray you, who requireth you to beleeue any minister of these dayes, before any of those auncient fathers, in respect of the credite of the persons, and not of the truth which they bring? You knowe that Panormitane thinketh more credite is to be giuen to one lay man, speaking the trueth according to scripture, than to all men of all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, speaking contrarie to the trueth or beside the truth of the scriptures. But it is a matter of fact you say, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2866:345"/>
such and such traditions came from Christ &amp; his Apostles or no, and therefore they that liued neerer the time of the deede dooing by twelue or thirteene hundreth yeares, are more like to knowe the trueth than wee. I answere, that all things that you pretende for traditions, are not of one sort, some are contrary to the word of God, and are reproued by euidence of the holy scriptures, other are beside the worde of God, and therefore not necessarie to bee receiued, because they are not found in the holie scriptures. As for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue of antiquitie, cannot argue a certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the fact in these ancient fathers, seeing in two or three hundreth yeares, that was before their time, and the time of the deede supposed to be done, any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble might be obtruded vnder pretence of such tradition as we prooue that many were. Yea when they that were neerest of all to the Apostles time, as Polycarpus and Anicetus, do not agree what was the Apostles traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which was not expressed in their writing, it is manifest, that they of much latter time, coulde haue no certein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thereof. And that whatsoeuer ceremonie or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise the Apostles deliuered, which was not expressed in the scripture, was but temporall or arbitrarie in the power of the Church to vse, or not vse, as it might best serue for edifying. Finally, where you affirme, that Fulk came but yesterday from the Grammar schole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to make it seeme that he is but a yong grammatian, either your dayes be neere as long as thirtie yeres, or else your pen runneth beyond your knowledge of him, or at leastwise your malice ouer reacheth your knowledge. But yet to this extremitie (of crediting one Charke, or Fulke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so many auncient fathers) you say you are driuen, and bid men hearken a little howe D. Fulke handleth these men about traditions. And first S. Cyprian alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging<note place="margin">

If Cyprian breake his owne rule, who can excuse him? But if he had beene vrged as much for the necessitie of water, as he was for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of wine in the sacrament, he would haue better considered of the matter.</q> Who seeth not I suppose no lesse authoritie against Cyprian, than of Cyprian him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and therefore I boast not of mine owne credite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue his?</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>To proceede, Tertullian is alleaged saying that the blessing with the signe of the crosse, is an apostolike tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Fulke: Tertullians iudgement of tradition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out scripture in that place is corrupt.

But in deede there is in the place by you noted, other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes in these wordes: Tertullians iudgement of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition without scripture in that place is corrupt, <q>for Martiall himselfe confesseth, that a tradition vnwritten should be reasonable and agreeable to the scriptures: and so he sayth the tradition of blessing with the crosse is, because the Apostles by the holy ghost deliuered it: But who shall assure vs thereof? Tertullian and Basill are not sufficient warrant for so worthy a matter, seeing S. Paule leaueth it out of the vniuersall armour of God.</q> This last and inuincible argument in rehearsing my wordes you leaue out, which because perhaps you could

                  <p>But you goe forwarde. S. Ierome is alleaged, saying that lent fast is the tradition of the Apostles. Fulke.

Wherefore seeing it is certaine, that by testimonie of Iustinus Martyr, that there was no mention of the dead, in the celebration of the Lordes supper, for more than an hundred yeares after Christ, we must not beleeue Chrysostome without scripture, affirming that it was ordeyned so by the Apostles.

Heere you note in the margent a proude questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is not so right as if I should note against it a proude censure. For it is a question that may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded in humilitie, why the Lord if it were his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, that the dead should be prayed for at the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as a thing necessarie for them, and dutifull for vs: would not reueale so much by those witnesses that are aboue all exception, rather than by such as are all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly conuicted of errors, as you Papistes cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. But because neuera Papist of you all is able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere this question, to the satisfaction of any mans doubtfull conscience, you thinke best to reiect it, and say it is a proude question.

But in truth, my wordes are more full than you alleage them, against the pretended insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. If it be lawfull for me once to pose the Papists, as you doe often the protestantes, <q>I woulde learne why the Lorde would not haue this doubtlesse institution, and as you take it the most necessarie vse of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, plainely, or at the leastwise obscurely set foorth by Matthewe, Marke, Luke, or Paule, which all haue set foorth the storie of the action of Christ, the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the sacrament, and the ende or vse of the same. If it were not meete at all to be put in writing, why was it disclosed by Tertullian, Cyprian, Augustine, &amp;c?

                  <p>I finde also, that in the Popish annotations, vpon the new Testament printed at Rhemes, my writings are carped at in two places, the former vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 2. Thes. 2. where my wordes against Saunders Rocke, page. 248. &amp; page 278. are rehearsed: In which I say that Leo &amp; Gregorie bishops of Rome, although they were not come to the full pride of Antichrist, yet the mysterie of iniquitie ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing wrought in that seate neere fiue or sixe hundred yeares before them, and then greatly increased, they were so deceiued with the long continuance of errour, that they thought the dignitie of Peter, was much more ouer the rest of his fellowe Apostles, than the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly scriptures of God (against which no continuance of errour can prescribe) doeth either allowe or bear<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> withall.</p>
                  <p>Againe, the testimonies of Leo &amp; Gregorie, bishops of Rome, as alwayes so nowe I deeme to bee vnmeete to be heard in their owne cause, though otherwise they were not the worst men, yet great furtherers of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of Antichrist, which soone after their dayes tooke possession of the chayre, which they had helped to prepare for him.</p>
                  <p>For this I am called a malepeart scholer of Bezaes impudent schoole. But by what reason? For placing the mysterie of Antichrist, as woorking in the see of Rome euen in S. Peters time. That the mysterie of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist did worke in S. Peters time, the text of S. Paul is plaine. That it did worke in Rome, where Antichrist should be openly shewed, S. Iohn is plaine in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation. Ca. 17. ver. 9. &amp; 18. yea, the Papists confessing that S. Peter called Rome Babylon, must needes grant as much: this onely then remaineth in controuersie,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:2866:348"/>
whether in the sea or church of Rome, the mysterie of iniquitie did worke, from the Apostles time, vntill Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ was openly shewed. Seeing it wrought at Rome, it wrought either in the church or altogether out of the church: but it wrought not altogether out of the church, therefore it wrought in the church. That the mysterie of iniquitie preparing for that Antichrist wrought not altogether out of the church, it is manifest, because the seat of Antichrist is prophesied to bee in the Temple and Church of God. Without the Church, was not the mysterie of iniquitie against Christ, but open wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and persecution of Christes Church. Therefore within the Church that mysterie did worke. By what meanes first, it is not certaine, because it was a secrete, not reuealed by the Apostle. Some coniecture that it was by preferring one bishop before all the clergie of elders or priests, which at the first were equall. Some thinke that such factions began at Rome, as afterwarde were at Corinth, one holding of Cephas, that is Peter, another of some other. How euer it was, the challenge made to Peters chayre, and from the dayes of Victor, diuerse bishops of Rome creeping vp by litle and litle, &amp; pretending authoritie ouer other Churches, &amp; other churches reuerencing that see, for many good respects, were abused by Satan to set forwarde his purpose in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncing the throne of Antichrist. And where I saide, that Leo &amp; Gregorie were great furtherers of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of Antichrist, my meaning was not, that they did wittingly &amp; willingly prepare a seat for Antichrist, but that the d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

crosse, O Gregorie, O Leo, if we be deceiued, you haue deceiued vs: For his meaning was not thereby to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low whatsoeuer they had done or written, but that in some such matters as are in controuersie betweene the Papistes and vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> euen Gregorie and Leo are witnesses against them.</p>

Heb. 3. vers. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. &amp; 6. Against this sound doctrine, let vs examine what the heretikes alledge.

For by the eternall spirite is vnderstood that infinite power of the diuinitie, vnited to the humanitie, by which the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Christ was consecrated, that by the same liuely or quickening vertue, by which he created vs he might also restore vs. Whereunto our Sauiour Christ had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:2866:350"/>
when he saide Ioh. 6. It is the spirite that giueth life, the flesh profiteth nothing. But this (say the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes) is to make Christ God the fathers priest, &amp; not his sonne. Nay rather, this is to acknowledge Christ to be both his fathers sonne, and his priest, euen as the Apostle sayeth: The law appointeth priestes, men that haue infirmitie: but the worde of the othe which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the lawe, the Sonne for euer perfected. Heb. 7. v. 28. Where by the oppositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of men hauing infirmitie, with the Sonne perfected for euer: it is most cleare, that the worde of the othe maketh Christ, as he is the Sonne of God, a priest after the order of Melchisedech. Where I cannot omitte the shamefull corruption of this text, in the popish translation, which to hide this opposition, betweene men, and God the sonne of God, hath altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther left out this worde, men, although it be in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine expressed manifestly: <hi>Lex enim homines constituit sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotes infirmitatem habentes,</hi> which they translate thus: For the law appointeth priestes, them that haue infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie.</p>
                  <p>But to proceede. Our accusers adde further, that our assertion is to make Christ to doe sacrifice and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to God his father, as his Lorde, and not as his equall in dignitie and nature. I aunswere no more than when S. Paul sayeth, that Christ when hee was in the forme of God, and thought it no robberie to bee equall with God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he made himselfe of no reputation, tooke vpon him the shape of a seruant, became obedient to the death, euen the death of the crosse. I haue suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently before distinguished, that all partes of his priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood that required obedience, seruice, homage, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie, subiection, he perfourmed as man: but the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of reconciling men vnto God, he wrought as God and man, euen as the Apostle writeth: God was in Christ reconciling the world to him selfe, 2. Cor. 5. ver. 19. That he might be a priest therefore able and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to make attonement with God, he was God: that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:2866:350"/>
his reconciliation and satisfaction might extende to men, he was man: and so beeing God and man he is <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> perfect mediator betweene God and man, and an high priest for euer after the order of Melchisedech.</p>
                  <p>All this notwithstanding, they oppose against vs the authoritie of the fathers, who doubtlesse had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meaning, than we to keepe this distinction. First Augustine in Psal. 109. is produced to say: that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as hee was man he was priest: as God he has not priest. But Augustines wordes are somewhat otherwise vppon the text, <hi>Iurauit Dominus, &amp;c.</hi>

For to this ende thou wast borne out of the wombe before the day starre, that thou mightest be a priest for euer after the order of Melchisedech. For according to that he is borne of God the father God with God, toeternall with him that begetteth, he is not a priest: but a priest for his flesh assumpted, for the sacrifice which being taken of vs, he might offer for vs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In these words Augustines meaning is plaine ynough that Christ according to his diuine and eternall gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, could not haue beene a priest for vs, except hee had taken our flesh and beene borne a man, which wee doe alwaies confesse. But that our redemption by his sacrifice was the meere worke of his manhoode onely, he sayth not but the contrarie if he be marked. For he sayth that the sonne of God was a priest, for the fleshe which he tooke of vs, that he might offer for vs that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice which he tooke of vs. Heere it is plaine that Christ as God offereth sacrifice, but he offereth as a
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:2866:351"/>
priest, for to offer sacrifice pertayneth to a priest, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ as God, is a priest: yet not as God only, but as God and man. Whereupon the same Augustine saith afterwarde: <hi>O domine qui i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And to what ende? but to perfourme those partes of a priest, which were proper to God, that is to reconcile vs vnto God, to haue authoritie of himselfe and of his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and worthynesse, to come before God, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the fauour of God alwayes, which no creature hath but through his worthinesse and gracious gift.</p>
                  <p>The next authoritie brought against vs is Theodoret <hi>in Psal.</hi> 109. who is cited thus: As man he did offer sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, but as God he did receiue sacrifices: verily, we say as much and more also, that he offered sacrifice as God also reconciling the world to himselfe. <q>But in truth the wordes of Theodoret are otherwise and to an other ende. <hi>Sacerdos autem non est Christus, qui ex Iuda secundum carnem ortus est, non ipse aliquid offerens, sed vocatur caput e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum qui offerun<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>: quandoquidem eius corpus ecclesiam vocat, &amp; propterea sacerdotio fungitur, vt homo, recipis autem ea quae offeruntur vt Deus: offeri verò ecclesia, corporis eius &amp; san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinis symbola, omne fermentum per primitias sanctificans.</hi> And Christ is nowe a priest, which is sprung of Iuda ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the flesh, not offering any thing himselfe, but is called the head of them that offer, seeing he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the church his bodie, and therefore he exerciseth the priesthoode as a man, and hee receiueth those thinges that are offered, as God:</q> and the church truely
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:2866:351"/>
doth offer the tokens of his bodie and bloud sanctifying euerie leauen by the first fruites. In these wordes The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret speaketh not of the sacrifice that Christ offered himselfe, but of the spirituall sacrifice of thankesgiuing which the church offereth to him in celebrating the memorie of his death. Not of the priesthoode which Christ did exercise in earth, but of the priesthoode that he doth exercise in heauen, not now offering anie thing, but as God receiuing oblations. And where he sayth that nowe he exerciseth the priesthoode as man, he denieth not but that he doeth exercise it as media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, God and man. Which is more plaine in his expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the Epistle to the Heb. cap. 8. where he enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth how Christ doth both sit at the right hande of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, and yet is a minister of the holy thinges. <q>

                           </gap>.</hi> If therefore it be proper for priestes to offer giftes, and Christ as concerning his humanitie truely is called a priest, and he offered none other sacrifice but his owne bodie, therefore our Lorde Christ had a bodie. He sayth not that Christ is a priest

according to his humanitie onelie,</q> whereas the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of his person being both God and man, caused <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

But to make the matter cleare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side that which the Apostle writeth to the Hebrues ca. 9. these argumentes may plainely be drawen out of the 7. cap. where he speaketh expresly of his priesthood af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the order of Melchisedech.</p>
                  <p>Christ as he is without father and without mother is <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Christ as he is God and man is without father and without mother, therfore Christ as he is God and man is a priest after the order of Melchisedech.</p>
                  <p>Againe, Christ as he hath no beginning of his dayes nor ende of his life, is a priest after the order of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedech:</p>
                  <p>Christ according to his diuinitie hath no beginning of his daies nor ende of his life according to his whole person:</p>
                  <p>Therefore Christ according to his diuinitie and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his whole person is a priest after the order of Melchisedech.</p>
                  <p>Againe, except you vnderstand Christ to haue beene a priest according to his diuinitie, he was tythed in the loynes of Abraham as well as Lcui, but according to his diuinitie hee was not in the loynes of Abraham, and therfore payde no tythe in Abraham as God, though as man he was subiect to the law, but receiued tythes of Abraham in his priest and figure Melchisedech. For the priest receiueth tythes in the name of God, as also he blesseth in the name of God. Therefore if Christ giue priestly blessing in his owne name, he giueth it as he is God and not as man onely.

according to his humanitie, in which the father is gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than he, is as farre from Arrianisme, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes are from honestie and synceritie, to charge vs with such open blasphemie.</p>
