            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>That the ſaid Subſcription-Book and Receipts may be produced to the general Court or Committee appointed for that purpoſe, and compared by them, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Frauds and Miſtakes.</p>
            <p>Manufactures are the only means to enrich a Nation, ſupport the Crown, and not only employ the Poor, but alſo draw Foreigners into the Kingdom.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Fourteenthly,"/> Likewiſe popularity in a Kingdom, is the enriching thereof; for by their Labour and Induſtry they will make Riches flow: Therefore a flouriſhing Trade will raiſe Wealth, and make the Nation happy and glorious; for it draweth Treaſures from foreign Countries, and keeps our own at home. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Fifteenthly,"/> It is well known, that this Kingdom is endowed with good Land for yielding of Hemp, Flax, &amp;c. and alſo with good Air and Water, and all Materials, as Linnen Rags to make Paper, and Glue to ſize it; for the French formerly uſed to carry their Linnen Rags and Glue from hence to <hi>France,</hi> until prohibited by the late King's Proclamation; therefore the Paper Manufacture is evidently known to be of a vaſt Conſequence, when the <hi>French</hi> were ſo much againſt the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment thereof, that Monſieur <hi>Barylon,</hi> the late <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadour, with his Factors, Agents, and Friends, uſed their utmoſt Endeavours to hinder the ſame, by enticing the Corporation's chiefeſt Workmen from their Paper Mills, with Bribes, and promiſes of great Rewards, and ſo ſent them away privately to <hi>France,</hi> to the unſpeakable Damage of this Nation and Corporation; beſides the Tax of Twenty Five Pound <hi>per Cent.</hi> laid by the late Parliament, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Writeing and Printing Paper, made, and to be made in this Kingdom, which obliged us to ſell our Paper the dearer, and the <hi>French,</hi> on the other hand, endeavouring to under-ſell us, hath been no ſmall Diſcouragement in the infancy of the Eſtabliſhment of this great and beneficial Manufacture. And this Kingdom being well accommodated with all Neceſſaries and Materials, as aforeſaid, by the growth and product thereof, to promote all the aforeſaid Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, and being alſo furniſhed with good ingenious Workmen of ſeveral Nations, who can Manufacture all the aforeſaid Works, and teach the weaker ſort how to Work in their ſeveral Occupations, will conſiderably increaſe the King's Revenue.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Sixteenthly."/> Here is alſo, at this juncture, a very ſeaſonable opportunity for eſtabliſhing moſt of all other Manufactures which are in <hi>France,</hi> and ſo prevent vaſt Sums of Money which are uſually ſent from hence thither for ſuch Commodities, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying all ſorts of Artificers and Tradeſmen, as well <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants as others, who are to my certain knowledge) capable of Undertaking and Manufacturing the ſame, tho' for want of Aſſiſtance to ſet them to Work, ſeveral poor Families are ready to ſtarve: But if the ſaid Manufactures be encouraged, and thoſe poor Souls employed therein, that they may live, it will not only increaſe Trade, and the King's Revenue, and eſtabliſh new Manufactures here, but above all, it will draw Heaven's Benidiction on us, for thoſe <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants of this Nation, who have fled from their Native Country, and quitted Houſes, Lands, Goods, Stocks, Preferments, Imployments, and what elſe they had of their own, are the Flower of that Kingdom for Chriſtianity and Ingenuity, as I have been informed by certain learned judicious <hi>Engliſh</hi> Divines, and who think it a great happineſs to have eſcaped Perſecutions, Cruelties, and Tyrannies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were daily oppreſſed, and have full liberty to ſerve God, and ſing Praiſes to his holy Name, under the Protection of his Sacred Majeſty, King <hi>William,</hi> whom God preſerve.</p>
            <p>Whereas it is manifeſt, that there never hath been ſeen heretofore in <hi>England</hi> ſuch numbers of Poor who want Work, as Silk and Linnen-Weavers, and other Tradeſmen; and alſo multitudes of poor Houſe-keepers, &amp;c. that are ready to ſtarve for want of Work, who are not, nor cannot be employed in the Woollen Manufacture, but may in the Linnen, in making ſeveral ſorts of Linnen-Cloth, Sail-Cloth, Canvas, Thred-Laces, Fringes, and Tapes, Fiſhing-Nets, Ropes, &amp;c. wherewith this Nation is ſupplyed by other Forreign Countries, to the value of ſeveral Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thouſands of Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> as it may appear by the Cuſtome-houſe Books; which may be prevented by ſetting our Poor to Work in this Manufacture, and keep the Mony in the Kingdom: Therefore the employing of the Poor being for the good of all People, as Houſe-keepers, Merchants, Travellers, Farmers, and all manner of Dealers whatſoever, who are daily Sufferers, and much injured by Robbers, Thieves, and other vicious Perſons, and alſo very much oppreſſed and

incumbred with the Poor: It is humbly hoped, that all good Chriſtians will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto afford a favourable Reception, it being for the Publick Good, as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>And for the better ſatisfaction of the Subſcribers, The ſaid Mr. <hi>Dupin,</hi> having been one of the firſt Governours of ſix Corporations for the Linnen and White Writing-paper Manufactures in theſe three Kingdoms of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> before ſpecified (as it may appear by ſix ſeveral Charters and Patents, enrolled in the High Court of Chancery in the aforeſaid three Kingdoms, Confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by four ſeveral Acts of Parliament, which paſſed the Royal Aſſent) is capable and qualified to manage this undertaking. So that a great number of Noble-men, Merchants and others, became Partners, and raiſed Stocks of two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds, and upwards, and great Quantities of all ſorts of Linnen and White Writing-paper was made in the three Kingdoms, as good as any that came from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea, to the value of ſeveral hundred thouſand Pounds, which did employ many thouſands of Poor and other People, before, and during this laſt tedious War; whereby he hath much improved his Experience for diſcerning what is good and profitable in them to keep; and what hath been amiſs and loſs, to prevent for the time to come.</p>
            <p>And whereas there are in and about the City of <hi>London,</hi> and within the Weekly Bills of Mortality, 135 Pariſhes; it is, for the conveniency of each Pariſh, propoſed, That there ſhall be one Subſcription Book, with printed Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, to ſhew how things are to be governed and regulated: Which ſaid Books are to be lodged in ſome convenient place in each Pariſh, in the Cuſtody of reſponſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Perſons, in order to take in the Subſcriptions of all People who will be pleaſed to Subſcribe therein; and the Mony ſo Subſcribed to be collected about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>January</hi> next, by ſome truſty Perſons whom the Court ſhall appoint.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Mr. <hi>Dupin</hi> doth oblige himſelf, at his own proper charges, to provide the ſaid 135 Subſcription Books for all the aforeſaid Pariſhes, and all the printed Articles and Propoſals, and to view the moſt proper Work-houſes, and make his Report to the Court for their Advice and Approbation; and will alſo produce to the ſaid Court a Liſt of the Names of all ſuch Work-Men and Women, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who ſhall be fit and qualified to teach the ſaid Poor to Work, and overſee the ſame; and will make an Inventory of all things neceſſary to be provided for the carrying on of this national and benificial Work; by which means the Pariſhes will be diſcharged of 50000 Poor, at the end of the firſt Year, and a perpetual Stock of Two Hundred Thouſand Pounds and upwards, will remain in clear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, lodged in the Chamber of <hi>London;</hi> or Bank of <hi>England,</hi> for the uſe of the Poor.</p>
