         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the great Prince, <hi>and Satan that olde Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,

<hi>and</hi> woe: ioy to the heauens and to them that dwell

out thence: <hi>but</hi> woe to the inhabitants of the earth
and of the sea, (<hi>that is, to the sonnes of men in this
vale of teares</hi>) for the Diuell is come downe vnto
them with great wrath, knowing that he hath but a
short time.</p>
            <p>In this voice (right Honourable) are two things affirmed, touching Satans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
first, that his casting out of heauen is ioifull to the Saints; next that his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
downe on earth is wofull vnto men. Is the matter of our woe, ioy to
the Saints? Nothing lesse; but that the Diuell might be knowen to be an
euill guest where euer he comes, the heauens doe reioice for his departure,
and sea and earth ought to mourne for his approaching; so that he is, or at
leastwise ought to be, no where welcome, except it be in hell; and all such
persons may well perceiue themselues, not heauenlie but plainly hellish min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,

            </p>

deuouring creatures keepe their circuites and obserue their times; they

of Satan which doth procure his woe; it may be he hath seene the plaiers and
the painters Diuels, some blacke horned monster with broad eies, crooked
clawes or clouen feet; and till some such thing appeare vnto him, he neuer
feareth hurt by Satan: little doth he thinke that ignorance in the scriptures,
neglect of Gods worship, profaning Gods sabbaths, with greedy affecting

friend is Satan to corruption in the workes of darkenesse, that if nature doe

            <p>But is there no remedy to man for all this woe that comes by Satan? Yes,
blessed be our God who hath not left vs for a praie vnto his teeth, but to

               <note n="k" place="margin">Act. 26. 18.</note>

               <hi>which they
are kept by the power of God vnto saluation.</hi> Yet we must so conceiue of this
deliuerance, that as Israel being brought out of Egypt, was not presently set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the land of Canaan, but for the space of forty yeares was exercised with
sundry temptations in a barren and drie wildernesse, where they met with
<note n="o" place="margin">Num. 21. 6.</note>
               <hi>fierie serpents,</hi> and were encountred with many and strong enemies, who
sought to debarre them from the promised land: so the children of God,
though redeemed by Christ, are not presently translated from the bondage of
corruption, to the full inheritance of perfect glory in the heauens; but must
passe through this vale of teares, and in the wildernesse of this world meete
with that crooked serpent the Diuell who will seeke to stinge their soules to
death, and also stirre vp many an<note n="p" place="margin">1. Sam. 15. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Amelec</hi> to entrap them in the way, that
either through disobedience or vnbeliefe they may be depriued of their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
Canaan. True it is, this match is farre vnequall, for flesh and bloud to
fight against spirituall powers; yet heere is comfort, that we haue him for our
Captaine who in his<note n="q" place="margin">Coloss 2 15.</note> deepest humility spoiled our strongest aduersary,<note place="margin">Heb 2. 14.</note> and

Sir WILLIAM RVSSELL, Lord Russell,
Baron of Thornhaugh, yoonger sonne to that most Christian
and Honourable Earle, FRAVNCIS Earle of
Bedford; with the vertuous Lady his wife,
Grace and Peace.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>IGHT Honorable,<note place="margin">Mat. 3.</note> as Iohn the Baptist was in one desert, so our
Sauiour Christ he was in an other:<note place="margin">Mat. 4. 1.</note> but as these two differed in their
being in the world: so did they not accord in their being in the
wildernesse. Iohn was with some men, Christ with none; Iohn was
with wilde men, Christ with wild beasts; Iohn was preaching, Christ
praying; Iohn was baptizing, Christ fighting; Iohn was feeding,
Christ fasting; Iohn was encountring with Diuels incarnate, Christ
did encounter with the Prince of those Diuels. From Iohn prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
in the desert, learne wee diligence in our callings: from
Christ tempted in the desert, see we troubles at our calling:<note n="a" place="margin">Psa. 34. 19.</note> Many are the troubles of the
righteous, but the Lord deliuereth them out of all.</p>
            <p>If it please you to giue these after-lines the reading, you shall see set downe that monomachie
or single combat, which was hand to hand betwixt Christ and the Diuell. And as for Christ
Iesus, you shall see him fasting, fighting, conquering. Fasting and an hungry, to shew he was
man: fighting and encountring, to shew he was Messiah; and conquering and triumphing, to
shew he was God. And as for the diuell, you shall see him obiecting, answering, flying. Obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting,
that<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 4. 3.</note> Christ might despaire;<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 4. 6.</note> answering, that he might presume; and<note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 4. 11.</note> flying, when he
could not ouercome.</p>
            <p>In Christs temptations, we see the estate of the<note n="e" place="margin">1. Pe. 2. 21.</note> Church; in Satans assault, we see his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
to the<note n="f" place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 8.</note> Church, Is Christ tempted? think it not strange if we fall into<note n="g" place="margin">Ioh. 15. 20</note> temptations. For
the griefe of the head, is the griefe of the<note n="h" place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 26.</note> members: and the temptations of Christ, shew the
temptations of<note n="i" place="margin">Ioh. 15. 20.</note> Christians. It is true of Christ, that<note n="k" place="margin">Act. 14. 21</note> by many tribulations he did enter into
the kingdome of God: that<note n="l" place="margin">Heb. 2. 10</note> our High Priest was consecrated by afflictions, that so he must suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
and enter into his<note n="m" place="margin">Luk. 24. 26</note> glory.</p>
            <p>He is no sooner borne into the world, but he is<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 2. 14.</note> hunted by Herod; baptized at Iordan,<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 3. 16. 4. 1.</note> but
Satan sets on him; a Preacher for repentance, but the<note n="c" place="margin">Ioh. 7. 1.</note> Scribes proscribe him; to<note n="d" place="margin">Luk. 11. 15.</note> worke mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
but the Pharises slander him. He is no sooner to suffer, but<note n="e" place="margin">Ioh. 12. 27.</note> the Diuell assaults him;
apprehended, but the<note n="f" place="margin">Ioh. 18. 28</note> Iewes deliuer him; deliuered, but<note n="g" place="margin">Luk. 23. 11.</note> Herod derides him; derided, but
<note n="h" place="margin">Luk. 23. 24.</note>Pilat condemnes him; condemned, but the souldiers<note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 27. 27.</note> abuse him. Is he on the crosse? the
<note n="k" place="margin">Mat. 27. 39.</note>people will not pity him: is he risen? the high Priests will<note n="l" place="margin">Mat. 28. 15.</note> belie him. In a word, is he vpon
earth? he is tempted in his<note n="m" place="margin">Luk. 11. 16.</note> person; is he in heauen? he is<note n="n" place="margin">Act. 9. 4.</note> tempted in his members. Thus
the life of Christ was a warfare vpon earth, and the life of Christians must be a warfare vpon
earth. We liue heere in a sea of troubles: the sea is the world, the waues are calamities, the
Church is the ship, the anker is hope, the sailes are loue, the Saints are passengers, the hauen
is heauen, and Christ is our Pilot. When the sea can continue without waues, the shippe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
tossings, and passengers not be sicke vpon the water, then shall the Church of God be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
trials. We begin this voiage so soone as we are borne, and we must saile on till our dying
daie.</p>
            <p>We doe reade in Gods word of many kinds of temptations: <hi>God, Satan, Man,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi>
and the <hi>Flesh,</hi> are saide to tempt. <hi>God</hi> tempteth man to trie his obedience, <hi>Satan</hi> tempteth
man to make him disobedient: <hi>man</hi> doe tempt men to trie what is in them: and <hi>man</hi> tempteth
God to trie what is in him. The <hi>world</hi> is a temper, to keepe man from God: and the <hi>flesh</hi> is a
<pb facs="tcp:16197:5"/>
tempter, to bring man to the Diuell: So <hi>God</hi> tempted Abraham<note n="a" place="margin">Gen 22. 1.</note> in the offering of his son:
<hi>Satan</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Iob. 1. 18.</note> tempted Iob in the losse of his goods: a<note n="c" place="margin">1. Kng. 10. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Queene</hi> tempted Salomon in trying his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
<hi>men</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Ex. 17. 3.</note> tempted God by distrust in the desert: the <hi>world</hi> tempted Domas,<note n="e" place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 10.</note> when he
forsooke the Apostles: and the <hi>flesh</hi> tempted Dauid,<note n="f" place="margin">2. Sa. 11. 4.</note> when he fell by adultery. Doth God
tempt vs? take heed of hypocrisie: doth Satan tempt vs? take heed of his subtiltie: doth man
tempt man? take heed of dissembling: doth man tempt God? take heed of inquiring: doth the
world tempt man? take heed of apostasie: doth the flesh tempt man? take heed of carnalitie.
But dowe so? are we warie of these tempers? No, we are not, and therefore we fall. We fall
on the right hand, by temptations in prosperitie, and we fall on the left, by temptations in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie.
Of the one it may be said, it hath slaine<note n="g" place="margin">1. Sa. 18.</note> thousands: of the other, that it hath slaine
ten thousands.</p>
            <p>When we come and see cities dispeopled, houses defaced, and wals pulled downe, we say, the
souldier hath beene there: and when we see pride in the rich, discontent in the poore, and sinne
in all, we may iustly say, the Tempter hath beene there.</p>
            <p>Now of all other temptations, it pleaseth God to suffer his church to be tempted with afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
It is neuer free either from the sword of Ishmael; which is<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 21. 9.</note> a reuiling tongue: or the
sword of Esau, a<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 27. 41.</note> persecuting hand. Neither was there yet euer Christian man found, who had
not his part in the cup of affliction. We must drinke of the<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 20. 23.</note> same cup our master did:<note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 10. 24.</note> the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciple
is not aboue his master.</p>
            <p>The reasons why God doth visit vs thus with afflictions, are: 1. To humble vs. 2. To weane
vs. 3. To winnow vs. 4. To preuent vs. 5.<note place="margin">Reasons why God doth afflict his children.</note> To teach vs. 6. To enlighten vs. 7. To honour vs. 8.
To cure vs. 9. To crowne vs. 10. To comfort vs. 11. To protect vs. 12. To adopt vs. And last
of all, to teach and comfort others. To<note n="e" place="margin">Ec. 3. 10.</note> humble vs, that we be not proud:<note n="f" place="margin">Psal. 119. 67.</note> to weane vs, that
we loue not his world:<note n="g" place="margin">Luk. 22. 31.</note> to winnow vs, that we be not chaffe:<note n="h" place="margin">Psal. 119. 71.</note> to preuent vs, that we do not
sinne:<note n="i" place="margin">Psal. 39 9 40. 1.</note> to teach vs, that we be patient in aduersity: to<note n="k" place="margin">Ge. 42. 21.</note> enlighten vs, that we see our errors: to
<note n="l" place="margin">Lam. 5. 11.</note>honor vs, that our faith may be manifest: to cure vs, that we<note n="m" place="margin">Deu. 32. 15.</note> surfet not of securitie: to
<note n="n" place="margin">2. Tim. 4. 7.</note>crowne vs, that we may liue eternally: to<note n="o" place="margin">Ioh. 6. 33.</note> comfort vs, that he may send his spirit: to<note n="p" place="margin">Act. 12. 7.</note> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
vs, that he may guide vs by his Angels: to<note n="a" place="margin">He. 12. 7.</note> adopt vs, that we may be his sonnes:<note n="b" place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 5.</note> and
to teach others, that they seeing how sin is punished in vs, they may take heed it be not found in
them: that they<note n="c" place="margin">2. Cor. 1. 6.</note> seeing our comforts in troubles, may not be discouraged in the like trials.</p>
            <p>Thus a Christian mans diet is more sowre then sweet: his physicke is more alcës then hony:
his life is more a pilgrimage then a progresse: and his death is more despised then honoured.
This if men would thinke of before, afflictions would be as welcome to the soule of man, as<note n="d" place="margin">Ruth. 2. 8.</note> affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Ruth was to the field of Boaz. But because we looke not for them before they come, thinke
not on Gods doing when they are come, and doe desire to be happie both heere and hereafter;
therefore we can away with the name of Naomi, but in no case would we be called<note n="e" place="margin">Ruth. 1. 20.</note> Mara.
We<note n="f" place="margin">Ioh. 1. 5.</note> see the sea, not the whale: the<note n="g" place="margin">Exod. 14. 11.</note> Egyptian, not the saluation: the<note n="h" place="margin">Dan. 6. 16. 22.</note> Lious mouth, not
him that stoppeth the Lions mouth. If we could see God in our troubles, as<note n="i" place="margin">2. King. 6. 16.</note> Elisha did in his,
then would we say: There are more with vs, then there are against vs. But because we doe
not, therefore at euery assault of the Assyrians, we say, as the seruant to<note n="k" place="margin">2 King. 6. 15.</note> Elishah did: Alas
master, what shall we doe? and with the disciples: Carest thou not Master that we perish? Yet
it is good for vs to suffer affliction:<note n="m" place="margin">Iam. 1. 12. Ioh. 5. 17.</note> Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he
is tried, he shall receiue the crowne of life which the Lord hath promised to them that loue him.
It is<note n="a" place="margin">Pro. 3. 11.</note> commanded by God,<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 4. 2.</note> practised by Christ,<note n="c" place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 12.</note> yeelded to by the Saints,<note n="d" place="margin">Psal. 119. 71.</note> assigned by Gods
prouidence, and good for vs ech way. We are Gods<note n="e" place="margin">Ps. l. 1. 4.</note> trees, we shall groe better by pruning: Gods
pomander, smell better by rubbing: Gods spice, he more profitable by bruising: and Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits,
we are the better by running. Let vs suffer afflictions, they are<note n="f" place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 17.</note> momentany in respect of
time:<note n="g" place="margin">Phil. 1. 29.</note> fauors, if we respect Gods loue, and a meanes to bring vs to the kingdome of God. If
they did consume vs, we might wish them an end: but they doe purge vs, let vs be content. They
<note n="h" place="margin">Act. 14. 21.</note>are Gods fan, we are Gods wheat: they are Gods boulter, we are Gods meale: they are Gods
<note n="i" place="margin">Pet. 1. 5.</note>flame, we are Gods bush: they are Gods<note n="k" place="margin">Ge. 22. 9.</note> cords, we are Gods sacrifice: they are Gods fornace,
we are Gods gold. The wheat will not be good without the fan, nor the meale without the boulter,
nor the bush without the flame, nor the sacrifice without the cords, nor the gold without the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace:
they are trials, not punishments, if we be sonnes: punishments, not trials, if we be slaues.
<pb facs="tcp:16197:5"/>
Let vs then beare them, they<note n="l" place="margin">Psal. 37. 37.</note> will haue an end: ioy<note n="m" place="margin">Ps. 126. 5.</note> will follow: they<note n="n" place="margin">Isa. 38. 10.</note> shew vs our weekenesse:

            <p>I haue good cause to thinke of Gods gracious deliuerance, being my selfe deliuered from a
great trouble. Since the time I was vnkindly dismissed from my poore charge, where I would
haue continued, if malice had not hindred me, I haue liued in an end of this City: dangerously
in respect of the sicknesse; poorely in regard of maintenance; and painfully, in respect of my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie:
yet till this time hath the Lord deliuered me: and as Paul said,<note n="a" place="margin">2. Tim. 1. 18.</note> he will deliuer me, if
that he see it be best for me.</p>

wrath for euer. Could he ouercome the world, and can he not ouercome many troubles in the

            <p>if he hath deliuered vs from the guilt of our sinnes, he will deliuer vs from the punishment of
our sinnes. Let vs then therefore be patient in trouble, constant in hope, rooted in loue: let vs
waite and he will come, call and he will heare, beleeue and he will performe, repent vs of our euill
committed against him, and he will repent of his euils intended against vs. He is ouer vs by his
prouidence, about vs by his Angels, in vs by his spirit, with vs by his word, vnder vs by his
power, and vpon vs by his Sonne. In him is our helpe, from him is our comfort, by him is our

of Christes
te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptations, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I haue chosen
to intreat, hauing
formerly handled the doctrine of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
because all that endeuour either
to get or keepe a good conscience, are
most of all subiect to temptations: Now
here we haue the speciall temptations of
the Diuell wherewith he assaulted our
Sauiour Christ, and in Christs example
the best way to auoid the same. This
description consisteth of three distinct
parts: First, A Preface or preparation
to a Combate betweene Christ and the
Diuell, vers. 1. 2. Secondly, The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
or conflict it selfe, vers. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.
8. 9. 10. Thirdly, The issue or euent of
this combate, vers. 11.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>Part.</hi> The Preparation to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
hath two parts: First, Christs going
foorth to that place where the combate
was to be fought, vers. 1. Secondly, his
abode &amp; conuersing in that place, vers. 2.
1. Christs going forth to the place is set
out by sundry circumstances of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelists:
as, The <hi>time</hi> when he went;
The <hi>authour</hi> of his going; The <hi>maner</hi>
how he went furnished; the <hi>place</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he went; And the <hi>end</hi> wherefore.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>Circumstance.</hi> The <hi>time</hi> when Christ
went foorth to be tempted is noted in
this word <hi>Then:</hi> what time this was, we
shall see in the end of the former cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter,
where is set downe the baptisme of
our Sauiour Christ by <hi>Iohn</hi> in the riuer
Iordan; as also the great honour and
maiesty wherewith he was there renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
for it pleased Christ for speciall
end and purpose to be baptized, not as
we are, to put off sinne, for he had none;
but to be ordained a Mediatour for vs,
that putting on our sin he might beare
the burden thereof in our steed. Againe
in his baptisme he was distinctly proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<hi>The doctour of his Church:</hi> for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
thereupon, <hi>The Holy ghost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
vpon him like a doue,</hi> and a voice
came from heauen, saying, <hi>This is my
welbeloued sonne in whom I am well pleased.</hi>
Now so soone as Christ was thus so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
inaugurated into his office, and
proclaimed from heauen to be the sole
Doctor and Prophet of Gods Church,
euen <hi>then</hi> immediately without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
was he driuen forth, as Marke saith,
chapt. 1. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The vse.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Euery Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an must looke to be tempted.</note> In that Christ is no sooner
baptized, but he is presently tempted,
we learne; that all those who are truely
baptized into Christ must make account
to be tempted, and prepare for a combat
with the Diuell, euen through the whole
course of their liues: for if Satan durst
be so bolde as to encounter with Christ
Iesus the head of the Church after his
baptisme, then doubtlesse he will not
spare any of his members who are but
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:16197:8"/>
weake &amp; sinfull men. Again, in baptisme
a man giues vp his name vnto God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
therein for euer to renounce all
seruice to the Diuell, the flesh and the
world; and contrariwise to beleeue in
God, and to serue him; and this vow
being thus made, it is the will of God he
should be tempted, that in the schoole
of temptation he might learn to practise
his baptisme. But here most men wil say,
they neuer felt by experience in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
the trueth of this doctrine; for
they haue not perceiued any such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
in themselues, though they haue
bene baptized many yeres agone. <hi>Answ.</hi>
Such men,<note place="margin">The state of those that were neuer tempted.</note> whatsoeuer they be, haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the outward baptisme of water, but
they neuer yet receiued the inward bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
of the spirit; they weare Christs li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery,
but as yet they do seruice vnto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan;
And though they haue been made
partakers of the seales of the couenant,
yet still they abide within the kingdome
of darkenesse; for Christ heere teacheth
by his owne example, that all those who
haue receiued the inward baptism of the
spirit, whereby they haue effectually put
off sinne, and put on the Lord Iesus, are
as sure to be tempted by Satan as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
was: therefore let such persons as
neuer yet felt in themselues this spiritual
conflict, now begin to reform their liues,
and to performe their vow of baptisme,
and they shal vndoubtedly find in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
the truth of this doctrine, <hi>That all
that are baptized into Christ, shalbe temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the Diuell.</hi> So long as the children
of Israel continued vnder Pharaos bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
they were not pursued by his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
but when they set their faces toward
the land of Canaan, then presently he
makes after them, with all his might and
malice; euen so, while men liue in sinne
and submit themselues to Satans spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
bondage, he will suffer all things to
be in peace with them; but if once they
set their hearts on the heauenly Canaan,
and giue themselues syncerely to Gods
seruice, then will he with all his force
pursue them, &amp; meet them with armies
of temptations to turne them backe into
their olde way of sinne againe. The silly
bird that is in the snare or vnder the net,
so long as she lieth still feeles no harme;
but when she stirs &amp; offers to get away,
then begins her paine, and the more she
striues, the more she finds her selfe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snared:
So fareth it with silly men, while
they liue in sinne securely, they are not
troubled with Satans temptations; but
when they beginne to leaue their badde
courses, and settle themselues to serue
the Lord, then presently the Diuel seeks
to spread his net to intangle them in his
snare. The consideration whereof must
teach vs, <hi>to watch and pray that we enter
not into temptation;</hi> and (as Paul saith) <hi>to
put on the whole armor of God, that we may
be able to stand against the assaults of the
Diuell,</hi> Ephes. 6. 11.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in that our Sauiour Christ
after his solemne inauguration into his
mediatorship, was immediatly to go to
be tempted; we learn,<note place="margin">Men set apart for some speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all calling must looke for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation.</note> that all those that
are set apart by God to any speciall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
euen at their verie entrance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into
must looke for temptations. This
befell the head, and therefore all the
members must reckon for it. When
Moses was first called to be the guide
and conducter of Gods people out of
Egypt,<note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 2. 15.</note> hauing slaine an Egyptian in
defence of one of his brethren, vpon
knowledge of the fact he was fain to flie
from Pharaos court into the land of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,
and there to liue a shephers life
for many yeres with his father in law Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thro.
And Dauid was no sooner appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by God to be king ouer his people
Israel, but<note n="b" place="margin">1. Sam. 18. 9. 11.</note> Saul began to persecute him,
and so continued all his dayes. And our
Sauiour Christ, hauing called his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
to their office of preaching his
kingdome,<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 8. 23. 24.</note> tooke them soone after to
the sea, and there falling asleepe suffered
their ship to be so tossed with waues in a
great tempest, that they looked for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but present drowning, so as they
cried out, <hi>Master saue vs, we perish.</hi> And
this the Lord doth in great wisedome
for the good of his children:<note place="margin">1 Reason why.</note> first to
teach them, that no man is able of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
to carry himselfe in any acceptable
course of his calling without Gods spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
assistance and grace. Secondly, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
stir vp in them those good gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which he hath formerly bestowed
on them; as the feare of his name, the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16197:8"/>
loue of his maiesty, the gifts of prayer,
faith, patience, and many other which
he would haue tried in the entrance of
their callings, and exercised in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
therein vnto the end.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, seeing Christ begins his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall
office of treaching his church,
with temptations; This should admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
all Ministers of the word,<note place="margin">Ministers spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially must looke for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations.</note> that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
all Gods people must prepare
themselues against Satans temptations,
yet they must doe it aboue the rest; for
looke as in a pitched field, the enemy ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
principally at the standerd-bearer;
euen so Satan and his instruments, do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all Gods people, bend their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
forces against the ministers of Christ
which holde vp his scepter, and display
his banner in the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.
When <hi>Iehoshuah the high priest stood
before the Lord, Satan stood at his right
hand to resist him, Zak.</hi> 3. 1. And when
<hi>Ahab</hi> went to fight against the king of
Syriah, Satan became a lying spirit in the
mouth of 400. prophets &amp; mo, 1. <hi>King.</hi>
22. 22. This is that <hi>great red dragon, that
with his taile drew downe the third part of
the starres of heauen,</hi> that is, of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
and preachers of the word, <hi>and cast
them to the earth, Reuel.</hi> 12. 13. 4. This is
he that <hi>desired to winnow the Disciples as
wheat, Luk.</hi> 22. 31. And as the king of
Aram said of Ahab, <hi>fight not against small
nor great, but against the king of Israel only,</hi>
1. <hi>King.</hi> 22. 31. So Satan fighteth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
any so much as the Prophets of
Israel, the ministers of the Church.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">It is good for Ministers to be tempted.</note> in that Christ is tempted
before he go to preach, we learne that it
is good and profitable for Gods mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
to be exercised with temptations
euen of satan himselfe, &amp; that for sundry
causes; first, that they may know<note n="c" place="margin">2. Cor. 2. 11.</note> what
temptations meane; Secondly that they
may<note n="d" place="margin">2. Cor. 1. 4.</note> be the more able to minister helpe
and comfort to those that are tempted;
Thirdly to make them vnderstand the
word of God aright; for many places of
Scripture can not so well be vnderstood
by bare study onely, as by <hi>temptations</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">Act. 4. 24. 25.</note>
               <hi>therewithall;</hi> and it is true which one
sayth well, <hi>Reading, meditation, prayer,
and temptation, make a diuine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. <hi>Circumstance</hi> The author or effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
cause of Christes going foorth; to
wit, <hi>the Holy ghost,</hi> noted in these words,
<hi>was led by the spirit:</hi> The word <hi>led,</hi> in the<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note>
originall signifieth thus much, that Iesus
was carried apart by the spirit; which
must not bee vnderstood of any locall
transportation of his bodie from the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
to the wildernesse, as<note n="a" place="margin">2. King. 2. 11.</note> Elias was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
from earth to heauen; or as<note n="b" place="margin">Act. 8. 39. 40.</note> Philip
was taken away from the Eunuch, and
carried to Azotus; but it was a motion
of the Holy ghost, wherewith Christ was
filled aboue measure and made willing
to encounter with Satan in that combat;
for so are the words by S. Luke,<note n="c" place="margin">Luk. 4. 1.</note> 
               <hi>being
full of the Holy ghost hee returned from Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,
and was led by the spirit into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse,</hi>
that is, by the inward motion
and instinct of Gods spirit; Againe, S.
Marke saying,<note n="d" place="margin">Mark. 1. 12.</note> 
               <hi>the Spirit droue him into
the wildernesse,</hi> giueth vs further to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that this motion in Christ
from the spirit, was a peculiar motion,
not forced or constrained, but volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and yet <hi>very strong and effectuall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, by the <hi>spirit</hi> here, is not meant
the Diuell or an euill spirit, but the <hi>Holy
spirit of God:</hi> he it was that moued Christ
to goe into the wildernesse; so that the
meaning is this; After Christ was bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
in Iordan by Iohn, hee willingly
tooke his iourney into the wildernesse,
being moued thereunto by a speciall and
strong instinct of Gods holy spirit, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he was filled aboue measure. If any
aske, how Christ could be <hi>led</hi> by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
seeing hee sends the spirit: <hi>Answ.</hi>
These two may well stand together: for
Christ must be considered two wayes;
first as man in the forme of a seruant; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
as God, euen the sonne of God,
yea God himselfe: Now as Christ was
man, he was subiect to Gods prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
and so was led and guided by the Holy
ghost: but as he is God, he is not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but is the author ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and is not himselfe led or sent, but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the father sendeth the spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The vse.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The holines of Christs man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</note> In this circumstance we may
obserue; first the exceeding holinesse of
Christs manhood, in that he moued not
from one place to another, without the
speciall instinct and direction of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God. By which example we are
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16197:9"/>
taught to suffer our selues to be ordered
and guided by the spirit of God in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing we take in hand, yea in all our
thoughts, words and deeds; for this is
the true note of euery child of God <hi>to be
led by the spirit,</hi> Rom. 8. 14. where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
vseth the same word that S. Luke
doth speaking of this leading of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
to be tempted: we must therefore
labour to be of Dauids disposition, to
haue our harts pliable to all Gods testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies;
when God said, <hi>Seek ye my face,</hi>
Dauids hart answered, <hi>I seeke thy face O
Lord, Psal.</hi> 27. 8. and thus doing we shall
suffer our selues to be directed and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Holy ghost, for he teacheth
and guideth men by the word.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Temptations come not by chance.</note> from this that Christ was
led vnto temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the spirit of God;
we learne, That temptations come not
by chance, nor yet by the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the Diuel only: for he could not
touch Iob, or ought he had <hi>till God</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">Iob. 1. 12.</note> gaue
<hi>him leaue;</hi> nor enter into the heard of
swine, till Christ said,<note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 8. 32,</note> 
               <hi>go;</hi> but temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
come by Gods most iust permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and not without his speciall proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
&amp; appointment. This combat of
Christ with Satan was decreed of God
by his speciall appointment in his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
counsell. And therefore was Christ
led by the spirit to encounter with the
Diuell, that he might performe this one
worke of a mediator, namely in tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ouercome him, who by temptation
ouercame all mankind. And as God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
this combate of our Sauiour, so
hath he also ordained the temptations
of euery Christian and the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
thereof: The theater or place of this
combat is this present euill world; the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
are Satan and euery Christian; the
beholders are men and Angels, 1. Cor.
4. 9. The vmpire and iudge is God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
who ouerruleth Satan, so as the is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
cannot but be happie and blessed to
those that fight manfully; for <hi>hee casteth
away none that be mighty &amp; valiant of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
Iob. 36. 1. he will giue an issue with the
temptations, 1. Cor.</hi> 10. 13. from whence
we learne sundry good instructions.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, when we are tossed and tried by
manifolde temptations, we must not
thinke it strange, but rather <hi>count it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great ioy, Iam,</hi> 1. 2. because it is
Gods blessed will and ordinance that
Satan and euery Christian should enter
combat and conflict, for the triall of his
graces in them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we are hereby taught to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
labour with patience to beare all trials
and afflictions, not vsing vnlawfull
means to winde our selues out of them,
because they come by the speciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
of the Almighty.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Christ went not to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
till he was led by the spirit; therfore
no man must wittingly put himselfe into
danger without a calling from God, left
therein hee tempt God: indeed a man
may be moued extraordinarily, to offer
himselfe into places of danger; thus
<note n="a" place="margin">Act. 20. 22.</note>
               <hi>Paul went bound in the spirit to Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
that is, he willingly followed the
motion of the Holy ghost, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
enforced him to go thither. And
the same may be said of many holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
who though they might haue esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
by flight, yet did willingly offer
themselues into the hands of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutours,
and endured the violence of
their torments, which wee must thinke
they did by a special motion of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ghost; otherwise, for a man to offer
himselfe into danger without all warrant
from God, is to swarue from the practise
of Christ in this place.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Christ being ledde by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
spirit, did not seeke to shrowd himselfe
from this combate; so likewise if a man
follow his calling according to Gods
will, and thereupon fall into troubles
and temptations, he may not seeke to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape
them by neglecting his duty, but
with courage and patience must inure
himselfe to beare them, wayting on the
Lord by wel-doing for his deliuerance.
Heere it may well be asked, whether a
man can lawfully and with good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
abide in those places which are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
knowen <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> Of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in places haunted by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil spirits.</note> to be haunted with euill
spirits? <hi>Answ.</hi> Some indeed are so ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous
&amp; bold that they feare nothing:
yet the trueth is, no man ought on his
own head abide or lodge in such places,
vnlesse it be within the compasse of his
calling, or els haue a true extraordinary
motion of Gods spirit so to doe; we are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16197:9"/>
therefore rather to auoid them, than wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly
and willingly thrust our selues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the danger of such places; for if God
haue giuen liberty vnto Satan to possesse
such places as haue been consecrated to
Idolatry, or defiled by oppression and
bloud, or such like abhominations, why
should wee without warrant from God,
put our selues into his hands? This also
may serue to reprooue those men who
presume so much vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their strong faith,
that they neuer sticke to thrust them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
into most lewd company: but let
such persons beware, for places of bad
company are places of danger by reason
of that power and liberty which Satan
hath among them, for there he hath <hi>a
throne, Reuel.</hi> 2. 13. How then can it be,
that they should cleane escape the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of sinne, who do vsually conuerse
with those that commit it without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolement?
<note n="b" place="margin">Pro. 13. 20.</note>
               <hi>He that walketh with the
wise</hi> (sayth Salomon) <hi>shall be wise; but a
companion of fooles shall be made woorse:</hi> so
the words signifie: and therefore his
counsell is,<note n="c" place="margin">Pro. 1. 10.</note> 
               <hi>not to consent when sinners
entise vs:</hi> nor <hi>to</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Pro. 22. 24.</note> 
               <hi>make friendship with
the angry person, nor to go with the furious,
lest we learne their wayes and receiue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
to our soules:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fiftly, in this leading of Christ by the
spirit, we learne a further thing: so long
as Christ was a priuat man he liued with
Ioseph and Mary a priuate life; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
baptized, and thereby installed in
his office of Mediatour, he returnes not
to Bethlem or Nazaret where he was
borne and brought vp, but gets him
presently into the wildernesse, thereto
encounter with Satan, and that by the
motion of the spirit; wherein we may
see, that all that are appointed and set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
by God for any speciall calling, are
in some sort changed by his spirit, and as
it were made other men. When Saul
was anointed to be king, the text sayth,
<hi>God gaue him another heart. 1. Sam.</hi> 10. 9.
And when Dauid<note n="e" place="margin">Psal. 78. 71. 72.</note> was made of a shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
a king, he was furnished for that
place, as his behauiour shewed, which
was such as did beseeme a king. Thus
the Apostles of our Sauiour Christ, of
poore fisher-men, altogether<note n="f" place="margin">Acts 4. 13.</note> 
               <hi>vnlette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi>
by the gift of Christs calling,<note n="g" place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 6.</note> 
               <hi>were
made able ministers of the New testament,</hi>
and so became indeed <hi>fishers of men,
Mark.</hi> 1. 17.<note place="margin">Vse.</note> Which serues to confute
such men as plead extraordinary cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
as many haue done; some saying
they were Elias, some Iohn Baptist, &amp;c.
For if these were such men, and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
such extraordinary callings, then
should they withall haue beene endued
with extraordinary gifts fit for those cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings;
but no such thing befalleth them,
nay it is plaine, they remaine the same
men they were before, without any
change at all in respect of gifts fit for
such persons as they pretend themselues
to be. And to apply this to our selues;
we are all by nature the children of
wrath, and enemies vnto God; but by
grace we are made Kings, Priests, and
Prophets; Kings to rule ouer the world
and the Diuell, in respect of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocations
vnto sinne, as also to subdue
in our selues our owne euill lusts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;
Priests to offer vp spirituall sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
vnto God, as prayers and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
for his daily blessings; and Prophets
to instruct our selues and others in the
wayes of God, according to our gifts
and calling. Now then it behoueth vs
all to become new men, and to leade
new liues fitting and sutable to our holy
calling, giuing our selues wholly to the
honour and seruice of God, shewing
hereby, that we are hereunto called by
his spirit of grace and holinesse, so shall
we<note n="h" place="margin">Colos. 1. 10.</note> 
               <hi>walke woorthy of the Lord,</hi> and shew
foorth the vertues of him that hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
vs, 1. Pet. 2. 9.</p>
            <p>III. <hi>Circumstance.</hi> How Christ went
furnished into this place of combate:
which though our Euangelist Matthew
hath omitted, yet hath S. Luke plainly
noted, saying, <hi>He was filled with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ghost. Luk.</hi> 4. 1. If any shall say, this
seemes to import that Christ wanted the
the fulnesse of the spirit all the former
part of his life, if now only after his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
he were filled therewith. I answer,
This fulnesse of the spirit is ascribed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christ after his baptisme, not as
though he formerly susteined any want
of the spirit, but because at his baptisme
he receiued a greater measure of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
than he had before: for this we must
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16197:10"/>
know, that Christ was alwayes filled with
the spirit; being an infant he had a full
measure of gifts fit for his infancie, and
still as his growth in yeres required moe
graces of the spirit, he increased therein,
hauing in his youth &amp; in his riper yeres
full measure of gifts fit for his estate in
those times. And at his baptisme being
inaugurated into his Mediatourship, he
receiued such fulnesse of the spirit as
was behoouefull for so high an office,
which because it was farre greater than
before he needed, therefore is he now
sayd <hi>to be filled with the Holy ghost:</hi> so
that though Christ were alwayes full of
grace, yet he increased therein as his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
and calling did require.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The vse.</hi> This serues to confute the
Papists, who teach that Christ had all
fulnesse of spirit in his infancie, euen
from his conception and birth; and did
not grow in grace at all, saue only expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally,
as he had occasion to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
the same more and more in practise.
But. S. Luke sayth plainly, that <hi>Iesus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
in wisdome, and stature, and in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
with God and men, Luk.</hi> 2. 52. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
Christ was like vnto man in all
things, <hi>sinne only excepted,</hi> and therefore
did increase in grace as man doth in gifts
from time to time.</p>
            <p>Further, Christ goeth thus furnished
to this combate that he might be able
to encounter with Satan hand to hand,
and at the end giue him the finall ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.
Thus he furnished <hi>Moses</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Exo. 4. 11. 12</note> for
his ambassage vnto Pharaoh; and<note n="b" place="margin">1. Sam. 17. 45.</note> 
               <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
for his combate with Goliah; <hi>Aho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liab</hi>
and<note n="c" place="margin">Exod. 35. 30. 31.</note> 
               <hi>Bezaliel</hi> for the worke of the
Tabernacle; and euery one whom God
imployeth about any speciall worke, is
furnished and fitted thereto of God with
speciall gifts: whereby in euery age we
may see whom God placeth in any cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
for they are well qualified for the
duties thereof; and therefore those that
want gifts meet for their callings, doe
thrust in themselues thereto, and are not
placed therein of God.</p>
            <p>IV. <hi>Circumstance.</hi> Whither was
Christ led to be tempted? namely, <hi>into
the wildernesse,</hi> that is the place chosen
of God for this combate. There be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
opinions touching this place; some
thinke it was a little wildernes betweene
Ierusalem and Iericho; some the desert
of Palestina; others, the great desert of
Arabia, where Elias fasted forty dayes
and forty nights; and where the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
wandered forty yeeres. But seeing
the Holy-ghost doth not define what
wildernes this was, we are not curiously
to inquire after it,<note place="margin">Why Christ chose a desert for this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</note> but only know it was
a desert and solitary place. Let vs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
search into the reasons wherefore
he chose a desert place for this combat;
and they are diuers: First, because he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
was to worke our redemption in great
humility, euen in the base and low estate
of a seruant, for the satisfying of Gods
iustice in that nature which had sinned,
therefore he would not goe to Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
there to shew his glory and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
as a little before he was proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in his baptisme; but he gets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to a desert place void of all pompe
and glory, where he meant to begin this
great worke for vs by encountring with
our chiefest aduersary. Secondly, hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
chose this place for the more easie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countering
with our aduersarie Satan,
whom he was to ouercome for vs: for if
Christ after his baptisme should haue
shewed the glory of his Godhead, Satan
durst not haue medled with him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as the fisher hides the hooke and
shewes the bait to entise the fish, so our
Sauiour CHRIST with the vaile of his
flesh in this base estate and solitary place
did couer the glory of his Godhead,
that Satan seeing him only in this low
degree, might be the more eager and
bolde to set vpon him. Thirdly, Christ <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
was willing to giue vnto his aduersarie
the aduantage of the place, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
he might giue him the greater
ouerthrow; for the Diuell delights<note n="a" place="margin">Mark. 5. 5.</note> in
desert and forlorne places, and there he
would chuse to practise his temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
because in such places men want
those helps and comforts which in soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety

sayth,<note n="d" place="margin">Eccles. 4. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Woe be to him that is alone:</hi> yea,
God himselfe sayd of man in the state of
his innocency,<note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 2. 18.</note> 
               <hi>It is not good for man to
be himselfe alone.</hi> And that Satan takes
aduantage of such solitarinesse, appeares
by his tempting of Eue, when she was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16197:10"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> from her husband, <hi>Ge.</hi> 3. 1. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the praise and honour of this victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ouer Satan, was peculiar to Christ,
and not communicable to any creature:
and therefore Christ chose a desert place
for this combate apart from all humane
society, that no man might challenge
any part of this glory to himselfe, but
that it might be wholly Christs, as of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> right it was. Fiftly, he went into a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
place for a time, that afterward he
might thence returne with more credit,
reuerence and authority to exercise his
propheticall office: for we see by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
that when a man hath beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
for some time, he is receiued with
more reuerence at his returne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The vse.</hi> From hence the church of
Rome would fetch a ground &amp; warrant
for their monasticall life; saying, that as
Christ went apart into this desert, so
may men sequester themselues from or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
societies, and liue as Monks and
Heremites in cloisters, woods and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts.
But this collection is absurd, as
may appeare by these reasons: first,
Christ went not thus apart on his owne
head, but by the instinct and motion of
the spirit of God: but the Papists admit
and vndertake the state of Eremiticall
and Monasticall life without any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
in Gods word. Secondly, Christ
did thus sequester himselfe but once for
a certeine time: but with them, an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiticall
estate is ordinary and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
for their whole life. Thirdly, our
Sauiour Christ fasted truly all the while
he abode in the wildernesse: but Papists
in their Cloisters and Hermitages doe
plentifully inioy the wealth of the world
in great ease and liberty. And therefore
howsoeuer solitarinesse for a time may
be commendable in some cases, as to
<hi>meditate</hi> on the works or word of God,
as <hi>Isaac</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 63. or for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of<note n="d" place="margin">Luk. 5. 16.</note> 
               <hi>prayer</hi> and fasting in more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
maner; yet the Eremites life being
a perpetuall forsaking of humane socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
is neither warrantable by Gods
word, nor commendable in Gods child.</p>
            <p>V. <hi>Circumstance.</hi> The <hi>end</hi> why Christ
went into the desert; namely, to be
tempted of the Diuel: wherein obserue
three points; <hi>How</hi> hee was tempted;
<hi>wherefore,</hi> and <hi>by whom.</hi> For the first;
To <hi>Tempt,</hi> in Scripture is ascribed to
God, to man, and to the Diuell: <hi>God</hi>
tempteth man, when he <hi>prooueth</hi> him;
that is, when he maketh manifest what is
in his heart for sinne or grace, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were hid to the world: thus God
tempted Abraham in the offering vp of
his sonne, Gen. 22. 1. and Christ, the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
Luk. 18. 22. <hi>Man</hi> tempteth God,
when he prooueth by vnlawfull meanes
whether God be so powerfull, iust and
mercifull as the Scriptures doe affirme
him to be: and thus the Israelites tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
God, when they <hi>required meat for
their lust,</hi> and sayd, <hi>can God prepare a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the wildernesse? Psal.</hi> 78. 18. 19. The
<hi>Diuell</hi> tempteth when he allureth vnto
sinne, by inward suggestions or outward
obiects; and hereof must we vnderstand
Christs tempting in this place; to wit,
that he was led into the wildernesse for
this end that Satan might assault him,
and vse what meanes he could to bring
him vnto sinne. If any shall thinke it
was too much derogatory to the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Christ to be thus tempted. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
If it had so pleased him, Christ
could haue confounded the Diuell with
the least word of his mouth: for as he is
Creator of heauen and earth, so Satan
had no power to tempt him, <hi>for God can
not be tempted with euill,</hi> Iam. 1. 13. But
here Christ stood in our roome and sted
(as he did vpon the Crosse) encountring
with Satan for vs, as if we in our owne
persons had been tempted. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must be vnderstood as a part of
Christes humiliation in his manhood,
whereto he subiected himselfe for our
sakes, otherwise the Diuell could not
haue tempted him. <hi>Obiect.</hi> This stands
not with the holinesse of Christ as he is
man to be tempted of Satan? <hi>Answ.</hi>
Yes, he might be tempted of Satan with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sinne, as our first parents were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their fall: this will plainly appeare
by comparing Christ with other men in
their temptations.</p>
            <p>The Diuell in tempting a man to sin,
first conuayes into his minde, either by
inward suggestion, or by outward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,
the motion or cogitation of that
sinne which he would haue him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16197:11"/>
Thus he tempted Iudas, by<note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 13. 27.</note> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
into him this euill thought, <hi>Iudas
betray thy Master.</hi> And so dealeth hee
with Christ in this temptation, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed
to his mind or apprehension, the
vnrighteous cogitations of vnbeleefe,
idolatry, and couetousnesse; yet so as
Christ receiued them not, but with all
power of grace repelled them. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as Satan conuayes euill suggestions
into mens minds, so the same are full of
trouble, sorrow, &amp; vexation, at least to
the godly: for when Satan presseth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
man his temptations, the whole man
is disquieted, his thoughts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are troubled, and his heart is vexed.
And this also was in Christ, he felt sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
&amp; molestation in himselfe through
these temptations, as appeareth by his
<hi>Auant Satan</hi> vpon his last assault. And
thus farre was Christ tempted like vnto
men. Thirdly, in temptations vsually
be corrupt motions; for though a man
do not approue, neither enterteine with
delight, the Diuels temptations, yet
shall he hardly keepe himselfe from the
staine and taint of sin, because the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
of his owne heart are naturally
euill. Now herein Christ differeth from
all men in temptation; for being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
holy in his humane nature, he did
not in the least measure receiue any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
into his minde, but by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of grace did repel them more strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than they were offered.<note place="margin">Similitude.</note> Put a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
match to tinder or gunpowder, and
it will kindle presently; but put it into
water, and that will quench it straight:
so it fareth in temptations; our corrupt
hearts like tinder do easily suffer corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to kindle in vs; but Christes most
holy heart did presently like water
quench the euill of Satans motions.
And thus we see how Christ was tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and yet without sinne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The vse.</hi> Hence we may obserue a
good direction for their comfort that
are troubled with blasphemous thoughts.
Among other temptations that befall
men in Gods church, the Diuell doth
mightily assault some men by casting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their minds most fearefull motions of
blasphemie against God the Father, the
Sonne and the Holy-ghost, whereby he
doth greatly astonish them and bring
them to despaire. Now the ground of
their stay and comfort hence is this:
There be incident to the minde of man
two kinds of euill thoughts: First, such
as arise from the flesh, that is, from our
corrupt nature; and the very first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of these are sinnes, forbidden in
the tenth commandement. Secondly,
there be others that rise not inwardly
from the flesh, but are from without
conuayed into the minde by the diuell,
as these most horrible blasphemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God, which would make a godly
heart to tremble and quake once to
thinke vpon. Now these are our heauy
crosses indeed, when we be assaulted
with them, but the diuels sinnes wholly,
and become not ours, till we receiue
them by some degree of delight or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
as may hence appeare: for Christ
was tempted to infidelity, couetousnesse
and idolatry, yet his holy heart recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
them not, and so they neuer became
his sinnes.</p>
            <p>The second point to be considered in
this circumstance is, wherefore Christ
was tempted: for it may seeme strange
that Iesus Christ the sonne of God, yea
very God, equal with the Father, should
be tempted.<note place="margin">Reasons why Christ was tempted.</note> The reasons therefore that
mooued him to be tempted are these:
First, that he might foile the Diuell at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
his owne weapon; for the Diuell ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the first Adam in temptation,
therfore Christ the second Adam would
in temptation ouercome him. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
that in his example he might giue vs
direction whereby to know the speciall
temptations wherewith the Diuell as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults
the Church, as also how to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
and repell the same: for this cause
no doubt hath the spirit of God so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
set downe Christs preparation
to this combate, Satans seuerall assaults,
and Christes victory ouer them all:
which plainly confuteth the common
opinion of ignorant people, who thinke
those that are tempted by the Diuell to
be most vile and wicked men, such as
haue forsaken God, and therefore God
hath forsaken them; but beholde Christ
Iesus the most holy person that euer
was, euen the <hi>holy one of God,</hi> was tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16197:11"/>
of Satan, and that exceeding sore,
hauing the same troubles and vexations
thereby arising in his minde that wee
haue, insomuch as the Angels came to
minister co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort vnto him, vers. 11. Gods
dearest children therefore may and must
be tempted, for that is no token of a
childe of wrath, vnlesse we will say, that
Christ Iesus was the childe of wrath,
which once to thinke were most blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly Christ was tempted, that
he might be <hi>a mercifull high priest, vnto
them that are tempted, Heb.</hi> 2. 17. 18. for
himselfe knowing the trouble and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
of temptation, must needes in a
more compassionate fellow-feeling of
their miseries bee readie to helpe and
comfort his members when they are
tempted.</p>
            <p>The third point is, the author of
Christs temptations, to wit, <hi>the diuell:</hi>
the name <hi>Diuell</hi> signifieth a cauiller, a
slanderer and an accuser: He is an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
three waies; he accuseth <hi>God</hi> to <hi>man;
man</hi> to <hi>God;</hi> and <hi>man</hi> to man. First <hi>God</hi>
to man; as when he told Eue, they must
not die though they did eate of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
fruit, Genes. 3. 4. which was as
much as if he had said, God doth but
deceiue you with that threatning, yee
shall not die at all. Secondly he accuseth
<hi>men</hi> to God, and therefore is called the
<hi>accuser</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Apoc. 12 9.</note> 
               <hi>of the brethren:</hi> and <hi>our</hi>

which word <hi>aduersarie</hi> signifies one that
enters plea or suite against vs: thus he
dealt against godly Iob, by the Lordes
owne confession Iob. 2. 3. Thirdly,
he accuseth <hi>man</hi> to man, by ingendring
vngodly and vncharitable surmises and
suspicions in one man against another,
and in causing one man to slander and
iniurie another; and for this cause is he
said to <hi>worke in the children of disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

            <p>
               <hi>The vse.</hi> From this very name we are
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to be admonished of two things: First
to beware of false accusing, tale-bearing
and slandering; for in these practises we
put on the diuels name, and shew foorth
the infection of his nature: Paul telling
Timothie,<note n="d" place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 6.</note> that a <hi>minister</hi> must not be
a <hi>nouice, lest he be puffed vp and fall into
the condemnation of the diuell,</hi> vseth such
a word for the diuels name as signifieth
a false <hi>accuser</hi> or slanderer,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> to shew vnto
vs that such a one is a diuell incarnate:
And yet this is the common sinne of
this age, to speake euill and to backbite,
when they speake one of another. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
hereby we are taught to beware,
how at any time or any way we disswade
any one from embracing or obeying
true religion: for heerein we shew our
selues to be the children of the diuell.
When Elymas the sorcerer would haue
turned away Sergius Paulus from the
faith, Paul<note n="e" place="margin">Act. 13. 10.</note> cals him, full of all subtilty
and mischiefe, <hi>the childe of the diuell.</hi>
And this I doe the rather obserue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is a vsuall thing to draw others
backe from the power of godlinesse;
though not in plaine termes, yet partly
in reproches and partly by bad example
of life. Now all such had need to looke
to their estate, for the children of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
are like to haue their portion with
the diuell and his angels. And thus
much for the author of Christs tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
as also for the first part of Christs
preparation to this combat.</p>

preparation to this combate,

which is set out vnto vs by foure argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
I. by his fasting forty daies and

Of these in order.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>Circumstance. Christs fasting for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
daies and forty nights:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Three kinds of fasts.</note> There be three
kindes of fasts, if we take the word in a

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>and sobrietie,</hi> whereby wee vse
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16197:12"/>
Gods creatures for our sustenance with
that moderation and abstinence, that
we rather giue lesse to natures appetite,
then that which it desireth: This Christ
inioineth to euery Christian,<note n="f" place="margin">Luk. 21. 34.</note> 
               <hi>take heed
lest at any time your hearts be oppressed
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> with surfeting and drunkennesse.</hi> The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
kinde of fast is, the religious absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
of Gods church from all meates
and drinks for a time, for the furtherance
of their praiers, when they humble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
vnto God for the preuenting or
remoouing of some heauie iudgement:
thus the Iewes fasted,<note n="g" place="margin">Iudg. 20 26. 1. Sam. 7. 6.</note> sometime for
one day, sometime for three daies and
three nights, <hi>Hester</hi> 4. 16. yea sometime
for<note n="h" place="margin">1. Sam. 31. 13. 1. Chro. 10. 12.</note> seuen daies together; but then
it is like they receiued some sustenance
in the euening: for so <hi>Daniel fasted
for three weekes of daies, eating no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> things, Daniel</hi> 10. 2. 3. but of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of these must Christs fasts heere be
vnderstood. The third kinde of fast is
<hi>miraculous,</hi> done by the power of God
restraining the appetite for many daies
togither without meate or drinke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the power of nature: Thus<note n="i" place="margin">Exod. 34. 28.</note> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
fasted fortie daies and fortie nights
in mount Sina, where he enioied the
presence of God so long. And so did
Elias<note n="k" place="margin">1. King. 19. 8.</note> fast in mount Horeb; and our
Sauiour Christ in this wildernesse. We
reade indeed that <hi>Paul</hi> in his conuersion
<hi>fasted three daies and three nights eating
nothing, Act.</hi> 9. 9. So did the Iewes with
<hi>Hester</hi> and her <hi>maides, Hest.</hi> 4. 16. And
experience teacheth that a sicke man
may liue seuen or nine daies together
without meate or drinke, yea (as some
learned Physitians write) foureteene
daies: And Pauls companions in his
iourney to Rome, are very little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all, for <hi>foureteene daies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> for the
words are plaine,<note n="l" place="margin">Act. 27. 33.</note> 
               <hi>eating nothing:</hi> And it
may be so, sith the like hath beene found
true by experience in our age. And this
is the longest that a man can fast and
liue, to wit foureteene, or fifteene, or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenteene
daies; for so much is recorded
of some, that after so long abstinence
haue liued, though with some weaknesse
of nature: but for a man ordinarily, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of good constitution of body to fast
fortie daies and fortie nights togither, is
impossible. Indeed it hath beene auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<note n="m" place="margin">Iubart. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rad. 2. decad. 1.</note>that a man might fast monethes,
yea a whole yeare togither without meat
or drinke and yet liue; but we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
our selues it is not true. Now our
Sauiour Christ (which is yet more) du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this fast felt no faintnesse nor weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his body, as we ordinarily do with
a little abstinence, so that his fast was
not ordinary but miraculous altogither.</p>
            <p>The reasons why Christ fasted thus
long in the wildernesse may be these;<note place="margin">Reasons why Christ fasted fortie daies.</note>
First that he might performe his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
which now he was to begin, with
more reuerence and authority: for this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
cause would God haue <hi>Moses</hi> to fast for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
daies and forty nights before he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
the law written in two tables of
stone vnto the people; and so must <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi>
do, before he did restore religion in
his daies: Secondly, that it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
he was no whit inferiour to Moses
and Elias: and Thirdly, that he might <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
shew his full consent with them. <hi>Quest.</hi>
Seeing Christ did farre excell Moses and
Elias, why did he not exceed them in the
length of his fast, for threescore daies or
a whole yeare? <hi>Answ.</hi> Hee did it not
through want of power to haue fasted
longer, but because he would not giue
occasion thereupon that any should call
into question the truth of his manhood,
which might easily haue happened, if he
had fasted a whole yeere together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The vse.</hi> Heereon the Church of
Rome would build their Lent fast; but
very fondly; for first Christ did not thus
fast to giue vs example to follow him
heerein, but to prepare himselfe to the
great worke of his ministery; secondly,
there is great difference between Christs
fast and theirs; Christ fasted thus but
once, and that by the instinct of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost; they keepe their fast yearely,
and that on their owne heads: Christs
was a true fast, without all meat or drink;
but theirs is a mocke-fast, for they eat
the finest fishes and other dainties, and
drinke wines, wherein is as much nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment
to the body, and as good as in
flesh; neither can they iustly build it on
the practise of the primitiue Church, for
they vsed to fast (at least in some places)
but two or three daies before Easter:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16197:12"/>
and their Lent fast was not ordained<note place="margin">Antepaschale Ieiunium.</note>
nor imposed til many yeares after Christ;<note n="*" place="margin">Zanch, dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempt. l. 1. cap. 19. in the side quadrag. Iéiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio.</note> so as euery one might choose whether
he would fast, or not.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>Circumstance.</hi> S. Marke doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
set out Christs abode in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
by his being and conuersing with
wild beasts, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1. 13. which some
thinke Christ did for this end, that wild
beasts might come to him and doe him
homage due to their Creator &amp; Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:
but this is a deuice of man without
likelihood of truth; for howsoeuer Christ
in himselfe deserued all homage and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
of all his creatures; yet because
he abode among wild beasts to be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and humbled in the low estate of a
seruant, therefore it is not like he went to
receiue homage from them. The true
cause rather is this: we find in Scripture
that among the Iewes were two sorts of
deserts; one, in part peopled and inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited,
hauing heere and there cities and
villages; in such a desert was Iohn Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptist
borne, and did baptize and preach;
that the prophesie of<note n="a" place="margin">Isay 40. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Isay</hi> might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,
<hi>The voice of a crier in the wildernes,
make straight the way of the Lord.</hi> The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
not inhabited at all by men, being
a place of abode only for wild beasts, as
Lions, Beares, Tigers, Woolues, &amp;c.
which liued therein continually: Now
into such a desert as this, was our sauiour
Christ led by the spirit, and made his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode
among such wild beasts; which cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
is therefore noted to giue vs
to vnderstand that in this combate, our
Sauiour Christ had no aid, protection,
succour, helpe, or comfort from any man
or other creature whatsoeuer; for by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
his companions were so farre from
being an helpe and comfort vnto him,
that they would rather seeke to deuoure
him. Whereby we plainly see that the
praise of victory in this combate, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to Christ alone, and not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
to any creature whatsoeuer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The vse.</hi> In this estate of Christ in this
wildernesse, we may behold the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Christs militant church; to wit,
that it is in this world as in a wildernesse
and desert of wild beasts; for during their
abode on earth, Gods children liue with
men, who in disposition and affection
are like <hi>Woolues, Beares, Tigers, Lions
and Cockatrices,</hi> vntill such time as the
Holy Ghost by grace shall turne their
hearts, as we may plainly see, <hi>Isay</hi> 11. 6.
7. 8. in regard whereof they must arme
themselues with patience against mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
assaults and vexations, comforting
their hearts with this consideration, that
Christ their head hath vndergone this
estate before them.</p>
            <p>III. <hi>Circumstance.</hi> S. Luke<note n="b" place="margin">Luk. 4. 2. 3.</note> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth,
that while Christ abode in the
wildernesse, within the space of those
forty daies and forty nights, he was tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
of the Diuell, before the three
great temptations: the words are plaine:
<hi>And was there fortie daies tempted of the
diuell: And when they were ended, then the
diuell said, &amp;c.</hi> what these temptations
were, either for matter or forme, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost hath not set downe; and yet we
may probably thinke they were more
milde and gentle temptations then
those three which are set downe; the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
making them as it were an entrance
to his strongest and most dangerous
temptations; for his maner is, when it
makes for his aduantage, not to shewe
his violence and extremitie at the first,
but to proceed by degrees, and by little
&amp; little to insinuate himselfe till he haue
gotten his best aduantage, and then wil
he shew the strength of his malice. Thus
he dealt with Cain, first he prouokes him
to anger and malice against his brother,
because his brothers sacrifice was accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and his reiected; then hauing setled
hatred in his heart, he neuer leaues till
he had caused him in his rage to slay his
brother; and yet he staies not there, but
after bring him to despaire of Gods
mercy, in so much as he cried out,<note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 4. 13.</note> 
               <hi>my
sinne is greater then I can beare.</hi> Thus also
he dealt with Iudas; first he cast this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
thought into his heart, <hi>Iudas betraie
thy master,</hi> and when he had gotten en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
for that (for doubtlesse Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das
would not yeeld to so vile a thought
at the first motion) then he caused him
to put it in execution, whereupon in
fearefull despaire he brought him <hi>to
hang himselfe.</hi> This is the subtiltie of the
old serpent; first he conuaies one claw
or talant into a mans heart, and then
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:16197:13"/>
another; after that he gets in his head,
and so at length windes in all his bodie:
Thus he assaied to doe with Christ, and
so will he continue towards all Gods
children. Which should teach vs to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to be strong in the Lord, and wise
in his word, that so we may stand against
all his assaults: Yea, this must mooue vs
to a speciall watch through the whole
course of our liues against the occasions
of sinnes, that we may cut off temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the beginning, because it is Satans
craft, not to spit his venom at the first,
but to sugar his temptations at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
that no danger may appeare till
he haue conueled into vs the bane and
poison of our soules.</p>
            <p>IV. <hi>Circumstance.</hi> Christs abode in
the wildernesse is further set out by his
<hi>hunger,</hi> in the end of this verse; <hi>He was
afterward hungry:</hi> that is, after he had
fasted fortie daies and fortie nights by
the power of his Godhead, then he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to wax hungrie. But some will say,
this stands not with the glory and maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
of the sonne of God to be hungrie,
for <hi>his flesh is meate indeed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 53.</note> 
               <hi>and his blood
is drinke indeed. Answer.</hi> Christ was
content to lay aside his glory and maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
and to take vpon him our base and
fraile nature, becomming like vnto vs in
all things saue sinne; now in this his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basement
and humilitie he had not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a true soule and body, but the true fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
thereof, as vnderstanding, will,
memorie, &amp;c. and though his body
was free from personall infirmities, as
palsie, gout, dropsie, or such like, yet
he was subiect to such infirmities as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
to the nature of man, as hunger,
thirst, wearinesse, &amp;c. Yea this was one
part of his humiliation to become not
onely man, but man with infirmities: and
therefore though he could by the power
of his Godhead haue preserued himself
fortie yeares without meate or drinke as
well as fortie daies; yet that he might
abase himselfe to the lowest degree of a
seruant, he was content to sustaine the
infirmite of his humane nature in being
an hungred: And that for these causes.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">Reasons why Christ was an hungred.</note> to confirme vnto vs the truth
of his manhood; for some man might
say, it was an easie thing for him to fast
fortie daies and fortie nights, seeing he
had not a true body, but onely the shew
and shadow of a body: therefore to shew
that he was true man, and had a true
naturall body as we haue, he was content
to sustaine hunger, as we doe, and that
truely. Secondly, that hereby he might
cast an obiect before the diuell, to cause
him to be the more eager and violent in
his temptations, and to shew his malice
in full measure against him; for by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of his office whereto he was now
called, Christ was to encounter with
Satan our common enemie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
giues him not onely the aduantage
of the place, but also the opportunity of
estate, that Satan perceiuing his infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of bodily hunger, might thereby be
emboldened to giue the more violent
assault vpon him. And thus much of the
second part of Christs preparation to his
combat.</p>
            <q>
               <bibl>VERSE 3.</bibl>
               <p>Then came to him the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter,
and said, If thou be the Sonne of
God, command that these stones may be
made bread.</p>
            </q>
            <p>HEere beginnes this strange combat
betweene our Sauiour Christ and
the diuell, consisting of three great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts:
The first whereof is conteined in
this verse and the next, being indeed the
greatest of them al, as after shal appeare.
In this temptation obserue these three
things: first satans <hi>preparation</hi> to this
conflict: secondly the <hi>temptation</hi> it selfe:
thirdly, Christs <hi>answer</hi> and repulse made
thereunto.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>Point:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Satans prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> The diuels preparation is
in these wordes: <hi>Then came to him the
Tempter, and said:</hi> heerein obserue foure
things; first, the title giuen to Satan the
author of this temptation, <hi>the Tempter;</hi>
so Paul calleth him, 1. Thess. 3. 5. <hi>I sent
to know of your faith, left the Tempter had
tempted you in any sort:</hi> And satan is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Tempter,</hi> because his continuall
studie and practise hath beene and is, by
all meanes to tempt all men; he omits
no times, neither spares any paines day
or night, but by all meanes seekes to
draw men from God, and to bring them
to destruction: the consideration wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:16197:13"/>
should mooue vs to the practise of
these duties.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> to be watchfull in all maner of
prayers and supplication against Satan,
for the gratious protection of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his assaults: If any of vs had our
dwelling among Lions, Beares, or Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
which were hungerbit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
would seeke greedily for their pray,
we would be sure neuer to go out of our
dwelling houses, without preparation
for rescue &amp; defence, whereby we might
auoid their danger. Well, though we
haue no such wilde beasts to endanger
our bodies; yet our soules are dayly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted
by a more deadly enemie, euen
the diuell, whose continuall studie and
practise is by temptation to deuour vs,
1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. and therefore we must alwaies
be watchfull against temptations, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vpon vs the whole armour of God,
that we may be able to stand against his
assaults.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, as it is the Diuels practise
alwaies to tempt, and to seeke to draw
men from God, so because we must be
vnlike him in all things, we must draw
neere to God in the practise of all good
duties, <hi>Iames 4. 7. 8. Resist the diuell and
he will flie; draw neere to God, and he will
draw neere to you:</hi> the coniunction of
these two duties shewes, that the neerer
we come to God, the more we oppose
our selues to Satan: now <hi>he that commeth
vnto God must beleeue, Heb.</hi> 11. 6. and
therefore by faith must we<note n="a" place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 7.</note> 
               <hi>exercise our
selues vnto godlinesse,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth
<hi>Timothie;</hi> and vnlesse we thus striue to
be vnlike him, we shall neuer be able to
withstand his temptations.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, we must hence learne to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of the practise of seducers, in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to draw backe others from the loue
or practise of religion, or in hindring
the good meanes whereby religion is
begun and furthered in men; for if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by endeuour in action, or by bad
example we shall thus doe, doubtlesse
we become tempters, and the children
of the diuell: for to tempt and draw to
sinne is the propertie of Satan, and he
that in tempting fulfils the <hi>lusts of Satan,</hi>
must needs be <hi>his childe, Ioh.</hi> 8. 44. hence
it was, that our Sauiour Christ cals Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Satan,</hi> when he went about to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him from that worke for which
his Father had sanctified him and sent
him into this world, saying, <hi>Get behinde
me Satan, Matt.</hi> 16. 23. And when Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
sought to turne away the Deputie
from the faith, <hi>Paul</hi> cals him <hi>enemy to all
righteousnesse, full of all subtiltie, and childe
of the diuell, Act.</hi> 13. 10.</p>
            <p>The second thing in this preparation
is, the <hi>time</hi> when Satan began to tempt
our Sauiour Christ in a more strong and
violent maner, noted in this word <hi>Then,</hi>
that is, when Christ had now fasted for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
dayes and fortie nights, and was an
hungred; when the diuell saw Christ not
onely to be alone in the wildernesse, but
also perceiued that hee was afflicted
with hunger, and so the more weake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the low estate of a miserable man,
<hi>Then</hi> he prepares to assault Christ with a
most violent temptation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The vse.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Satans policie in tempting.</note> This discouereth vnto vs the
deepe policie of Satan in making choise
of the fittest time for his assaults: he
will not tempt all men at all times, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
alwaies with the greatest temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
but he forecasts for the time of
mans greatest weaknesse, and thereto he
reserueth his strongest assaults: Now
vsually a man is most weake, when he is
vnder some grieuous affliction; either
in bodie, minde, or both; or when he
lieth in the panges of death: these times
doth Satan obserue; and keep his stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
temptations against they come, as
doth notablie appeare by his dealing
with Christ, not onely at this time when
he was an hungred, but also and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
at his passion; for the Scripture
saith, <hi>He</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Coloss. 2. 14. 15.</note> 
               <hi>spoiled principalities and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
vpon the crosse: wherby is apparent,
that the Diuell with his greatest power
did then assault him, thinking either
then or neuer to giue him the foile,
when as he did sustain the wrath of God
due vnto the sinnes of man; and so will
he handle all the members of Christ; in
their greatest extremities they shall be
sure to feele Satans deepest malice, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
God restraine his power. Which
must teach vs in the day of peace and
strength, to prepare against the day of
weakenesse by any affliction or by death
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:16197:14"/>
it selfe, that so we may by Gods grace
be able to stand against the rage of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan;
for then he will be sure most eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to seeke our ruine, and vnlesse we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
before hand, we shall neuer be able
to stand: Now our best preparation is
to come to <hi>heare the words of Christ and
to do the same,</hi> for then, <hi>though the winds
blow, the raine fall, the waues beat,</hi> and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
do his woorst, yet being built vpon
the <hi>rocke Christ Iesus,</hi> we shall neuer fall,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 24. 25.</p>
            <p>The third thing in this preparation,
is the occasion of Satans onset at this
time, namely, <hi>Christs bodily hunger,</hi> as the
knitting of this verse to the former will
plainly shew, for <hi>Christ being an hungred,
Satan came vnto him and tempted him.</hi> He
could not find in Christs most holy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
any blemish of sinne, or inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereto whereon to build his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
yet such is his malice, that rather
then Christ should escape his hands, he
will take occasion from the infirmitie of
his nature in bodily hunger to prouoke
and allure him vnto sinne.</p>
            <p>Heerein we learne a speciall point;<note place="margin">Satan grounds his temptations on something in vs.</note>
namely, that the diuell will haue some
ground in vs for those temptations
wherewith he doth assault vs; for as we
may see by his dealing here with Christ,
he obserues not onely the inclination of
mans heart and soule, but the state and
constitution of the body, that if either
body or minde will affoord him the least
aduantage, thereon hee will be sure to
take occasion to tempt. If we regard the
seed and root of sinne, it is true that
euery man hath all sinnes in him, but yet
through the worke of God, restraining
corruption in some, and renewing grace
in others, it comes to passe, that each
man is more inclined naturally to some
sinnes then to others, which thing Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
doth obserue most diligently; and
as an enemie that besiegeth a citie will
goe about it and espie where the wall is
weakest and most fit for his entrance,
and there will be sure to giue his stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
onset; and as a man that would
strike fire with a flint, will turne it about
in his hand, to see what part is fittest;
euen so the diuell, he goes about a man,
and as it were turnes him to and fro, to
spie out his weakenesse, and to what
sinnes he is most inclined, and there he
will, be sure to trie him often, and to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
him with greatest violence. <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi>
If a man be impatient of pouertie,
he will seeke to carry him to picking and
stealing: If a man be proue to couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
he will prouoke him to fraud and
oppression: If he be enclined to ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Satan will puffe him vp with pride
and vainglory: nay, which is farre more,
Satan will take occasion from the verie
constitution of a mans bodie to draw
him vnto sinne; if choler be predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
in him, Satan will labour to stirre
him vp to wrath, anger, and furie, and if
he can, to bloodshed and murther: If a
man be of a sanguine complexion, Satan
will seeke to carrie him to immoderate
mirth, and to excesse in pastimes, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and delight, that if it be possible he
may drowne him therein, whether they
be good or bad: If a man be melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
Satan will sometime take occasion
by that humour to strike him with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
sadnes, with terrors and feares;
and otherwhile to intoxicate his braine
with strange fantasies and delusions,
causing a man to thinke himselfe to be
Elias, Iohn Baptist, Christ, &amp;c. So as it
is true which an ancient Diuine saith of
this humour, that it is the Diuels bait
wherewith hee sports himselfe. See the
experience heereof in the<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 17. 15.</note> 
               <hi>lunatike per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
whose disease was, to be exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
troubled certaine times of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
by reason of melancholie oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the braine. Now Satan (as it there
appeares) tooke aduantage of that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
to abuse him most fearefully, not
onely in making him deafe and dumbe,
but also causing him to cast himselfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
fire and water. So that looke how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sinnes and infirmities we haue in vs,
so manie dares we carry about vs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
Satan will seeke to wound vs. He
taketh ground or occasion from vs, of
all the aduantage he hath against vs; his
temptations are like fire and bellowes,
and our infirmities and corruptions are
wood and fewell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The vse.</hi> I. Hence then we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
our miserable estate by reason of
sinne; for thereby it comes to passe that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:16197:14"/>
we beare about vs those darts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the diuel doth wound vs. And sith
Satans craft and malice is such to take
aduantage from vs, for to worke our wo,
we must labour the more diligently, to
be throughly acquainted with our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
dispositions and inclinations, yea
with our bodilie infirmities, for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
will search vs; and when wee haue
truly found out our own estate, we must
set a strong watch and guard about our
owne hearts in respect of our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and so shall we be the better able to
breake the necke of Satans temptations.</p>
            <p>The fourth thing in this preparation
is, Satans comming to Christ; <hi>The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter
came vnto him:</hi> By which phrase it
is probable, though not certaine, that
the Diuell tooke vpon him the forme of
some creature, and so appeared vnto
Christ; thus he came to Eue in Paradise,
abusing the serpent to further his assault
against the first Adam: And it is like,
that in his combat with the second A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
he came in the shape of some crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
for otherwise he could not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be said to come and speake. Some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
thinke that these temptations were
inward in minde onely, and by vision;
others thinke they were altogether vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
and done actually; but the safest
way is to holde that they were in part
actually done in bodily maner, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shewed in vision. And thus much for
the preparation to the first conflict.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>Point. The temptation it selfe:</hi>
conteining matter of great importance,
being indeed the maine temptation of
all, in these words: <hi>If thou be the Sonne
of God command that these stones be made
bread.</hi> The Diuell being well prouided
for time and place, and aduantaged also
by Christs bodily hunger, doth heere
assault our Sauiour Christ like a cunning
Sophister, and frame his argument Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logistically,
thus:</p>
            <p>If thou be the sonne of God,<note place="margin">Satans Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie.</note> thou canst make
these stones bread.</p>
            <p>But thou canst not make these stones bread:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore thou art not the sonne of God.</hi>
The ground of this temptation is this:
It is no reason that the Sonne of God
should starue for want of food; but thou
must starue vnlesse thou canst make
these stones bread: and therefore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
thou canst do so, thou maist per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
thy selfe it was but a false voice
which thou heardest from heauen; <hi>This
is my welbeloued Sonne, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The scope and drift of Satan in this
temptation standes in two things; First
hee labours to ouerthrow the faith of
Christ. Secondly, to bring him to a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of vnbeleefe. For the first, By <hi>faith</hi>
I meane, a gift or grace in Christ, wherby
as he was man, he beleeued his Fathers
words to be true, which said, <hi>This is my
beloued Sonne in whom I am well pleased:</hi>
whereby wee may see, what the Diuell
aimes at principally in his temptations
against Gods children; for these his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults
against our Sauiour Christ are set
down for our instruction in this behalfe.<note place="margin">Satan seeks the ruine of our faith.</note>
Satans maine drift then in temptation
is to ouerthrow our faith, whereby wee
beleeue euerie part and parcell of Gods
word to be true: See this in his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Eue; first he labours to weaken
her faith in the trueth of Gods threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
which done, he easily brought her
to actuall disobedience in eating the
forbidden fruit. The same course hee
holdeth at this day; first he will seeke to
nuzzell men in ignorance, that he may
keepe them in vnbeliefe: if he faile that
way, then will he endeuour to plunge
their soules into some damnable errour
and heresie; and by one of these meanes
doth he destroy the faith of many; for
while a man remaines in ignorance he
can haue no saith; and if he misse of the
trueth of God, he wants ground for his
faith. Now the reason why the Diuell
labours so much against our faith is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we cannot truely relie vpon Gods
mercie, nor depend vpon his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
nor yeeld any acceptable obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to his commandements, vnlesse we
beleeue his word.</p>
            <p>More particularly we are to obserue
that special branch of Gods word which
the Diuell would haue Christ not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue;
euen that voice of his Father,
which a little before Christ heard from
heauen at his baptisme; <hi>This is my wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloued
Sonne in whom I am well pleased:</hi>
And this hath the holy Ghost recorded
in great wisedome and mercie to Gods
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:16197:15"/>
Church; for heereby doth appeare a
main drift of Satan against Christs mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
in his temptations, namely to make
them doubt of their adoption,<note place="margin">Satan seekes to depriue vs of assurance of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption.</note> and to
destroy this perswasion in them, that
they are the sonnes and daughters of
God; for if heerein he spared not the
head, doubtlesse the members shall not
escape his hands. This appeares by his
vsual assault against them, specially when
God shall lay vpon them any lingring
crosse or affliction, either in mind, in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
or in goods; then the diuel will sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
this into their minds; If thou werst
the childe of God, he would neuer lay
his hand vpon thee so long a time and in
so grieuous maner; neuer was any child
of God in this case that thou art in: But
God laies his hand thus heauie on thee;
and therefore thou maiest perswade thy
selfe that thou art not the child of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The vse.</hi> The consideration heereof
must mooue vs aboue all things to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
for assurance of our adoption, euen
to haue our consciences, assured out of
Gods word, that we are the sonnes and
daughters of God in Christ. The diuels
drift is to ouerthrow this perswasion in
vs, and therefore our endeuour must be,
to confirme and settle our hearts heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
This is the charge of the holy Ghost
vpon euerie childe of God; 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.
10. <hi>Giue all diligence to make your calling
and election sure,</hi> that is, get the assurance
thereof sealed vp in your hearts, by the
comfortable fruition and practise of the
sauing graces of Gods spirit, <hi>ioyning
vertue with your faith, and with your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
knowledge, with your knowledge tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and with temperance patience, and
with patience godlinesse, and with godlinesse
brotherly kindnesse, and with brotherly
kindnesse loue, vers.</hi> 5. 6. 7. And indeed
if we would haue true peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in euery estate whether aduersity or
prosperitie, let vs labour for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of our adoption: This will be our
ioy in want, in wealth, in bondage, in
freedome, in sicknesse, in health, in
life and in death. Heerein is that <hi>ioy of
Christ which neuer can be taken from vs,
Ioh.</hi> 16. 22. We cannot doe the Diuell a
greater pleasure, then to neglect the
getting of this assurance; for heereupon
he will take occasion (specially in time
of distresse) fearefully &amp; dangerously to
seeke to breake the necke of our soules;
he cares not much otherwaies what men
professe, and what knowledge and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
common giftes of the spirit they
haue, so that they want this blessed as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance;
and therefore with the Apostle
Paul, we must account all other things
to be but <hi>drosse and dung in respect of this
excellent knowledge of Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 8.</note> to be our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
and Redeemer. True it is, that
vnto many this exhortation will seeme
needlesse; for ignorant persons that
haue nothing in them but meere pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
will bragge most of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion;
but they that haue felt the
smart of temptation, doe know what it
is that will stand vs in stead, euen that
assurance only which is rightly founded
vpon the word of God; and therefore
forsaking the vaine conceits of our ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
let vs with all diligence vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feinedly
endeuour to get this resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
if we cannot of our selues attaine
vnto it, we must vse the direction and
helpe of Gods faithfull Ministers; for
howsoeuer it pleaseth some to thinke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
yet this is the vndoubted truth
of God, that a man in this life may ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narilie
be resolued and assured of his sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
            <p>The second thing which the Diuel ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
at in this temptation,<note place="margin">Satan would bring Christ to a practise of vnbeliefe.</note> was to bring
Christ to a practise of vnbeleefe, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in want of bread to turne stones into
bread, for the present satisfying of his
hunger; for the Diuell would needs
perswade our Sauior. Christ that he must
haue bread to saue his life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the want of bread would haue
brought him to this distrustfull course,
to turne stones into bread.</p>
            <p>And as the Diuell heere deales with
Christ, so he assaies to doe with all his
members; as he labors to worke vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
in their hearts, so he seeks to bring
them to the practise of vnbeliefe in their
liues. See the truth hereof in the course
of the world; Is a man oppressed with
outward want and pouertie? the Diuell
will tell him, he must needs liue, and
therefore will perswade him to robbe
and steale and to filch for his liuing. If a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16197:15"/>
man be sicke, and want present helpe in
lawfull meanes, or els be afflicted some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
extraordinarily, then will the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
mooue him to seeke to Wizards
and Witches, suggesting this into him
by one meanes or other, that they can do
more good in such a case then all the
Physicians in the world. This is a most
vile practise of vnbeliefe, and yet too
common in the world, wherein men for
the remoouall of some outward euill,
will not sticke to hazzard the losse of
their soules. We therefore must labour
to be acquainted with these wiles of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
and by the practise of faith in our
liues, labour to expresse the power of
faith in our hearts, as in all manner of
godly conuersation, so especially in v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
only lawfull meanes for our reliefe
in the time of miserie and distresse.</p>
            <p>But to come more particularly to the
words of this temptation; <hi>If thou be the
Sonne of God command these stones, &amp;c.</hi>
It may be demaunded, why the Diuell
should make choise of this question
wherewith to tempt our Sauiour Christ,
rather then any other? <hi>Answer.</hi> The
reasons heereof may be these: First, he
knew well, that if Christ were the true
and proper sonne of God, then he must
needs be the true Messias; and if he
were that anointed of God, then also he
it was that must accomplish that old and
ancient promise made to our first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note>
               <hi>for the bruising of the serpents head:</hi>
This was the thing that of all other, the
Diuell was most afrayed of, and could
not endure to heare; and therefore by
mouing this question he intends to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe,
yea and (if he could) quite to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow
our Sauiour Christ in the right
of this title. Secondly, The Diuell since
his fall, beares an vnspeakable deadly
hatred against God himselfe, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his nature, as occasion serues, he
cannot but shew the same. Now in this
question hee doth notably bewray his
malice and spite against God; for, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in Christs baptisme a little before,
God had proclaimed him <hi>to be his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
sonne in whom hee was well pleased,</hi>
hereby the Diuell goes about to proue
the cleane contrary, and so as much as in
him lieth, seekes to make God a lier;
which, because it fitted his nature so
well, he makes choise of at this time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The vse.</hi> I. In this practise of the diuel
we may learne what to iudge of sundrie
false teachers; for as well in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
Church as also since that time, there
haue beene sundry men of great same
for wisdome and learning, as <hi>Ebion, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthus,
Carpoorates, Samosatenus,</hi> and
<hi>Arrius;</hi> who haue all laboured seuerally
to prooue, that Iesus Christ the Sonne of
Marie was not indeed the Sonne of
God, verie God, but onely a woorthie
Prophet. Now of them we may safely
thinke with the church of God in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times, that they were false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
heretikes and seducers, yea the
professed enemies of Christ, guided by
the spirit of Satan, for heerein they doe
directly tread in his steps.</p>
            <p>II. In this his practise we may obserue
the malicious and contradicting spirit of
Satan against God himselfe, for heere he
labours to conclude that Christ was not
the Sonne of God, notwithstanding
God himselfe had a little before auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
that he was. And this is his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
practise vnto this day; for where
God in his church pronounceth grace,
mercie and loue, there on the contrarie
will the Diuell pronounce a curse, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
and damnation. Againe, where
God denounceth his curse and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
there will the diuell seeke to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
a conceit of grace and fauour. If
a man be the childe of God, and haue
receiued the seale of grace for his assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
thereof; the Diuell will seeke to
weaken this assurance, and perswade him
if he can, that he is the childe of wrath.
And if a man be voide of grace, and so
indeed the childe of the Diuell, then
will Satan suggest into his heart presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous
thoughts, and make him thinke
he is the childe of God; so that euerie
way hee shewes himselfe contrarie to
God.</p>
            <p>Yet marke the diuels words a litle fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;<note place="margin">Satans policie in tempting.</note>
               <hi>If thou be the sonne of God, command
these stones, &amp;c.</hi> that is, doe but say the
word, and bid these stones to become
bread, and it will be done. And here in
the very propounding of this temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
we may obserue the deepe policie of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16197:16"/>
Satan; for in these few words (the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to effect his purpose) he coucheth
three most true and notable points in
Diuinitie: <hi>First,</hi> that he that is the Son
of God by nature, is also true and verie
God; for heere he ascribeth vnto the
Sonne of God the true prerogatiue of
God himselfe; a point wherin the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees
withstood our Sauiour Christ, and
which many heritikes since haue denied.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> that the true God can without
paine or labour, yea without all meanes
at his verie becke doe whatsoeuer hee
will; and by his word only make stones
become bread. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that to worke a
miracle of himselfe, is a property and
prerogatiue of him alone that is true
God; as to turne stones into bread in
this place. Now when the Diuell ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
all this, a man would not
thinke that herein he should intend any
hurt to Christ or to his church; but in
very trueth his drift heerein is, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroie
the faith of Christ in that word of
his father which spake from heauen, and
to ouerthrow the foundation of the
church, by proouing that Iesus Christ
the Sonne of Marie, was not true God.</p>
            <p>Heere then obserue a tricke of the
Diuels cunning;<note place="margin">Satan speakes some trueth to ouerthrow an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other trueth thereby.</note> when he speaks a truth,
he doth it not to confirme the same as
louing it, but indeed his meaning is to
ouerthrow the truth therby: which must
admonish vs, that when Satan shall any
way assault vs in temptation, wee neuer
giue credit vnto him, no not then when
he speaketh the trueth, because therein
his purpose is to deceiue vs and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the truth: hence it was that Christ
forbad the vncleane<note n="a" place="margin">Mark. 24. 25.</note> spirits to testifie of
him, though they acknowledged him to
be <hi>the holy one of God:</hi> hence also Paul
was grieued at the testimony of the foule
spirit that was in the maid, though in it
selfe a most worthy truth, to wit,<note n="b" place="margin">Act. 16. 17. 18.</note> 
               <hi>that
they were the seruants of the most high God
which shewed vnto me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the way of saluation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, in comparing our Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list
Matthew with S. Luke, there may
seeme some difference between them in
propounding this temptation, for in
Matthew the words are thus, <hi>command
these stones &amp;c.</hi> And in Luke<note n="c" place="margin">Luk. 4. 3.</note> thus, <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
this stone.</hi> But they are reconciled
thus, <hi>Matthew</hi> sets downe this tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as the Diuell first propounded it;
and S. <hi>Luke</hi> shewes how the Diuell vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
it: for first the diuel comes to Christ
and bids him, if he be the sonne of God,
command all the stones which he saw
round about him to be made bread, this
S. <hi>Matthew</hi> sets downe: or if that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
too much, command one stone to
be made bread and it should suffice;
and this S. <hi>Luke</hi> noteth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The vse.</hi> By this comparing of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelists
we may obserue; that when
the Diuell hath once begun to tempt a
man, he will not easily leaue off, but will
set an edge vpon it, and enforce and
vrge it by all the meanes he can, that if
it be possible it may preuaile. Which
should teach vs on the other side, to be
most earnest and resolute in resisting
Satans temptations: he will take small
aduantage before he leaue; we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must not<note n="d" place="margin">Ephes. 4. 27.</note> 
               <hi>giue place,</hi> nor yeeld one
iot vnto him:<note n="e" place="margin">Iam. 4. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Resist the Diuell and he will
flie.</hi> This must euery member of the
Church do; the Minister by sound and
through applying of euery part of Gods
truth to the heart, whereby it may be
armed against the enemie; and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
by faithfull embracing and obeying
of the same, as also by earnest praier vnto
God for the assistance of his grace in all
assaults.</p>
            <q>
               <bibl>VERSE 4.</bibl>
               <p>But he answering, said, It is
written,<note n="*" place="margin">Deutr. 8. 3.</note> Man shall not liue by bread
only, but by euery word that proceedeth
out of the mouth of God.</p>
            </q>
            <p>THese words conteine Christs grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
answer, whereby he repelled the
diuels temptation; and in it we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
three points; first, that Christ did
Answer: Secondly, whence he borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Answer: Thirdly, the very words
of his Answer.</p>
            <p>For the first, that Christ did answer,
is noted by the holy Ghost in plaine
words, <hi>And Iesus answering, said;</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he would giue vs to vnderstand, that
Christ Iesus our Sauiour being in the
wildernesse, was not onely willing and
ready to encounter with Satan, but also
able to withstand him, yea and to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:16197:16"/>
Satan without receiuing any foile
at his hands. Which is a point of singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
comfort to Gods Church and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
for was Christ Iesus able in this
low and base estate of a seruant, being
disaduantaged also by a desert place and
bodily hunger, was he then (I say) able
to encounter with Satan and to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
him in his most violent and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
assaults? Then how much more is
he now able euen in all his members to
giue Satan the foile, hauing spoiled him
in his death? seeing he is aduanced to
the throne of maiestie and glorie, and
set at the right hand of his father, hauing
a name aboue all names giuen vnto him,
at which euery knee should bow, both
of things in heauen and in the earth and
vnder the earth? We therfore may now
say, with <hi>that lowd voice;</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Reu. 12. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Now is salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in heauen, and strength, and power, and
the kingdome of our God, and the power of
his Christ: for the accuser of the brethren
is cast downe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second point heere noted is,
whence Christ borroweth his answer,
namely, from the Scriptures; <hi>It is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:</hi>
It had beene an easie thing for
Christ being the sonne of God, to haue
confou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the Tempter with the breath
of his mouth, or to haue commanded
innumerable legions of holy Angels to
haue driuen him away; but he betakes
himselfe to the written word for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
And this he did especially for
our instruction; namely, that we might
know,<note place="margin">The written word our best weapon against Satan.</note> that the <hi>written word of God,</hi> right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
welded by the hand of faith, is the
most sufficient weapon for the repelling
of Satan and the vanquishing of him in
all his temptations; hence Paul calleth
it<note n="g" place="margin">Ephes. 6. 17.</note> 
               <hi>the sword of the spirit,</hi> because it serues
not onely for our defence, but also to
wound Satan, and to put him to flight.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The vse.</hi> I. This fact of Christ doth
discouer and condemne the damnable
practise of the Church of Rome, who
locke vp the word of God from their
people in an vnknowen tongue, and
commend vnto them for their defence
against spirituall enemies other deuices
of their owne, as <hi>holy water, crossing, cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
&amp;c.</hi> which they highly commend
as meanes of speciall strength and force
to vanquish the Diuell; when as indeed
the word of God is the onely true and
trustie weapon, whereof while they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue
their people, they send them
forth naked and vnarmed to encounter
with Satan.</p>
            <p>Secondly, heere also behold the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
estate of all those that either
through couetousnesse or any other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanenesse
are drawen to neglect or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
the written word of God: their
case is most fearefull; for they cast away
those weapons whereby they should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
themselues against the Diuell, and
quench all his firie darts, and so betray
their owne soules into his hands: And
doubtlesse all contemners and negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
of the word are guilty of their own
damnation, because God hath giuen vs
his word for our defence, and for the
confounding of Satan, so as without
guilt of wilfull murther not of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
but of our soules, we cannot neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
this heauenly weapon.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, heerby we may see the cause
why sinne so much abounds in all estates
euery where, namely, the want of loue
vnto &amp; knowledge in the word of God,
whereupon the most are ignorant of it,
or else know not how to handle this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
weapon, whereby Satan is resisted
and foiled: <hi>Hosea</hi> 4. 2. The Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth
of <hi>lying, swearing, killing, stealing,
and whoring yea of bloud touching bloud;</hi>
and the cause is laid downe in the first
verse, <hi>There is no knowledge of God in the
land:</hi> This Dauid knew well, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
said, <hi>He hid Gods saying in his heart,
that he might not sinne against him,</hi> Psal.
119. 11.<note place="margin">1. Sam. 26. 7.</note> For as Sauls speare stood in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse
at his head euen when <hi>he slept,</hi>
so should Gods word, which is the <hi>sword
of the spirit,</hi> be euer in our hearts, as it
were ready drawen, that to what sinne
soeuer the Diuell allures vs, we may be
able to say for our defence, <hi>It is written:</hi>
through want hereof it comes to passe
that the Diuell at his pleasure leads men
captiues into all impieties.</p>
            <p>Lastly, this excellent vse of the word
vnderstood, beleeued, and obeied must
moue all ignorant persons to labour for
knowledge heerein, and with all ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor
after growth in knowledge, by holy
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:16197:17"/>
obedience, to shew foorth their faith:
If we had an enemy that had sworne our
death and vowed to see our bloud,
how carefull would we be, for our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
life, both to get vs weapons, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
some knowledge to vse the same, not
only for our defence, but also for the
annoyance of our deadly foe? Oh then
how carefull should we be for the safetie
of our soules to put vpon vs the whole
armour of God, and to learne to vse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
this <hi>sword of the spirit,</hi> that when
we meet with Satan our irreconciliable
enemy, in the field of temptation, which
is this miserable world, we may be able
both to award his blowes, and to wound
his head! It is lamentable to see how ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
people will blesse themselues in
their ignorance, and say they defie the
Diuell, and spit at him in defiance, and
yet they know not how they are intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
in his snares of their owne sinnes:
he little regards such defiance so long as
their soules lie naked and bare before
his deadly darts: let two men meet that
be at enmity, the one armed the other
naked, what will it auaile for the naked
man to defie his enemie with bigge
words, while in the meane time his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
enemy takes away his life? Lo, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
is this strong man armed, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
persons are poore naked ca<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ffes,
they defie the Diuell and spit at him
with their mouth, but in the meane time
the diuel wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds their soules vnto death.
They wil say they feele no such wounds,
and therefore they feare him not: but
they must know, that the lesse they feele,
the more cause they haue to feare; for
Satans wounds are most deadly when
they are least felt.</p>
            <p>The third point is, Christs Answer it
selfe: <hi>Man shall not liue by bread onely, but
by euery word that proceedeth out of the
mouth of God:</hi> This answer is borrowed
from <hi>Deuteron.</hi> 8. 3. And it is that lesson
which Moses sought to teach the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Israell after the Lord had fedde
them with food from heauen in that bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
wildernesse where they were affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with hunger. The words are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
hard, and therefore I will shew the
meaning of them. <hi>Man shall not liue;</hi>
that is, shall not preserue his temporall
life in this world; for of eternall life, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Moses nor Christ did intend to
speake. <hi>By bread only,</hi> that is, onely by
such ordinary meanes as food and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
sleepe, physicke &amp;c. which God
hath appointed in his prouidence for
the ordinary preseruation of natural life.
<hi>But by euery word that proceedeth out of
the mouth of God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Word</hi> in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture notes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers things.</note> This title <hi>word</hi> beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
diuers things in scripture: I. The
<hi>substantiall word of God,</hi> the second per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in Trinity, Ioh. 1. 1. <hi>In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
was the word, and the word was God.</hi>
II. It is vsually taken for the <hi>written word</hi>
conteined in the bookes of the olde and
new Testament, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 25. Thirdly,
it is sometime taken for Gods will and
decree, and it is called his <hi>good pleasure:</hi>
so Heb. 1. 2. <hi>Christ sustaineth all things by
the word of his power,</hi> that is, according
to his will and decree, by his powerfull
appointment: and by this word were all
things made in the beginning and heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
haue they been preserued euer since:
this is that word that melteth the Ice,
Psal. 147. 18. And in this last sense must
we vnderstand <hi>word</hi> in this place; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that man doth not preserue this
naturall life by ordinarie meanes onely,
but withall, by Gods good pleasure,
will and decree sanctifying the meanes
for his good. Note further that it is said
<hi>by euery word,</hi> and therein lieth the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of this sentence; for the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
whereof wee must know, that
this powerfull &amp; working word of God
may be distinguished according to the
matter whereabout it is occupied: Thus,
sometime God will haue men to liue by
<hi>bread</hi> the ordinary food of naturall life;<note place="margin">Gods powerfull word distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished.</note>
and this is his <hi>ordinary word.</hi> Sometime
his will and appointment is that man
shall liue by extraordinarie meanes; as
the Israelites did in the wildernesse
while they liued vpon Mannah; and
this is his <hi>extraordinary word:</hi> Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles
hee ordaines that man shall liue
without all meanes, as Moses did in
mount Sina, Elias in mount Horeb, and
our Sauiour Christ in this wildernesse;
for the space of fortie daies and fortie
nights together; And lastly he ordains
sometime, that man shall liue against
meanes and contrary to the course of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16197:17"/>
Thus Daniell liued in the Lions
denne, and the three children in the firy
furnace; both which last may be called
Gods <hi>miraculous word:</hi> So that wee see
good reason of this clause <hi>euery:</hi> for
heereby we learne, that man doth not
preserue his life only by ordinary means
ordained of God; but likewise <hi>by euerie
word proceeding out of the mouth of God,</hi>
that is, by euery appointment and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of God, whether <hi>extraordinary,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the vsuall meanes, or <hi>miraculous</hi>
without all means, or against the course
of nature: this we must labour to know
and be perswaded of. Nature teacheth
that man liueth by Gods blessing and
appointment in ordinary meanes: But
nature knowes not this, that God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth
mans life by his worde, aboue
meanes, without meanes, yea &amp; against
meanes. The beleeuing hart will hardly
yeeld to this, which Moses would teach
the Israelites; and therefore wee must
take the more paines to be resolued of
it. If any shall thinke hereupon, that a
man may liue by the written word with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
meat and drinke, he is deceiued; for
Christ meaneth not that euery word that
God hath spoken shall preserue naturall
life, but that whatsoeuer way he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
whereby man shal liue, whether
by ordinary or extraordinary meanes,
whether, without meanes or against
meanes, the same shall be effectuall for
mans preseruation: Thus much for the
meaning.</p>
            <p>The applying of this testimony to the
Diuels temptation, is thus to be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
the Diuels temptation was this. <hi>If
thou be the sonne of God, then commaund
these stones to be made bread: But thou
canst not make these stones to become bread:
Therefore thou art not the sonne of God.</hi>
To this Christ answers, by denying the
proposition or first part of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the ground whereof was this,
(which the Diuell tooke for granted)
that when a man is hungry hee must
needs haue bread or else he cannot liue:
and this our Sauiour Christ doth flatly
deny, saying; <hi>Man liueth not by bread on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but by euery word that proceedeth out of
the mouth of God:</hi> And this application is
most excellent, teaching vs that thing,
for the learning whereof the Israelites
were trained vp forty yeares in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse,
and fedde with Mannah from
heauen, and with water out of the rock;
to wit, that God by his word can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
the life of man without ordinarie
meanes euen what way soeuer hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth
for that purpose; and if wee
should spend our liues in learning heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
no doubt the time were not mispent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The vse.</hi> First, heereby we are taught
to consider aright of all creatures where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
our life is preserued, as meat, drinke,
apparell &amp;c. and that is thus, besides
the bodily sustenance of the creature,
we must labour to see a further matter, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
the blessing of God in the creature
proceeding from his word, decree and
appointment, whereby it is made fit and
able to yeeld sustenance and nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The Scripture calleth this the
<note n="a" place="margin">Leuit. 26. 26.</note>
               <hi>Staffe of bread,</hi> and so it is indeed, for
as an aged and impotent man falleth to
the ground if his staffe be plucked from
him, so the best creature that serues for
our vse, without Gods blessing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
fruitlesse vnto vs. This, reason
may teach vs, for how should that thing
of it selfe preserue and further life, which
in it selfe is void of life? And how should
that giue heat and warmnesse to our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
which of it selfe is void of heate?
let vs therefore confesse that it is not the
substance of foode that doth refresh vs,
nor the matter of our raiment that keeps
vs warme, but the blessing of him that
by his word hath ordained them for
these ends, if he withdraw his blessing,
the <hi>staffe and</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Isai 3. 1.</note> 
               <hi>stay is gone;</hi> men may <hi>eat</hi>
(as <hi>Haggai</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Hag. 1. 6.</note> saith) but they shal not haue
<hi>enough;</hi> they may <hi>drinke,</hi> and yet not be
<hi>filled;</hi> they may <hi>cloth</hi> themselues, and
not be <hi>warme;</hi> It is Gods blessing that
makes Gods creatures do vs good: how
else should it come to passe, that the
poore mans child which is barely clad,
and homely fed, should be as healthfull,
comely, and well liking as the child of a
Prince, but that God blesseth aswell the
homely food of the poore, as the dainty
fare of the richest.</p>
            <p>Secondly, heereby wee must learne
<hi>Sobriety and Temperance,</hi> in the vse of all
Gods creatures: when we vse our food
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:16197:18"/>
and raiment it is Gods blessing alone
that makes them do vs good, the Lord
as it were stands by vs to put his blessing
vpon euery morsell that we eat, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
draught that we drinke, and vpon our
raiment when we put it on; how then
dare wee abuse them in surfetting and
drunkennesse, in pride and wantonnesse?
may we not feare in so doing that while
the meate or drinke is in our mouthes,
the wrath of God will fall vpon vs; as
<hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 30. 31.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, hence wee must learne to
sanctifie Gods creatures as food and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which we vse for our comfort, by
inuocation on the name of God: for we
doe not liue by the creatures simply, but
by the word and appointment of God
blessing them vnto vs; and therefore
we must not be like vnto brute beastes
which receiue Gods blessings, but yet
neuer looke vp to heauen from whence
they come; or like to the swine that ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth
vp the mast, not looking vp to
the tree from which it falleth.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, heerby we see the common
errour of the world, who place the staffe
and stay of their life in the abundance of
outward blessings, whereupon they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to inrich themselues heerewith as
much as possibly they can; these men
do litle consider that mans life standeth
not in abu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance, neither doth he liue by
bread, but by the blessing of God, which
is and may be as well vpon a little, as
vpon the treasures of a kingdome. This
was the practise of the <hi>rich foole,</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Luc. 12. 19.</note> who
spake peace to his soule for <hi>ease and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime,</hi>
because <hi>he had much goods laide vp
for many yeares.</hi> But sith Christ teacheth
vs that man liueth not by bread only, it
must needs be a flat note of vnbeliefe, to
carke and care immoderately for the
things of this life.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, heereby wee are also taught,
not to entangle our selues ouermuch
with the cares of this world, nor to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
our harts to be oppressed with desire
of food, raiment, lands or liuing: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
our life and welfare consisteth not
in these things, but in the blessing of
God on whatsoeuer he sends be it more
or lesse: the gripple mind after much is
a deadly<note n="b" place="margin">1. Tim. 6. 9.</note> 
               <hi>snare,</hi> wherewith many a soule
is intangled to <hi>perdition and destruction;</hi>
This choakes the heart in such sort as the
seed of grace can take no root not bring
foorth any sauing fruite: this made Paul
to lay a charge vpon Timothy for rich
men, that <hi>they should trust in the liuing
God and not in vncertaine riches, 1. Tim.</hi>
6. 17. Let vs therefore be content with
food and raiment, and rather seeke the
kingdome of God and his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and then all those things whereof
we stand in need shall be giuen vnto vs
in the moderate vse of lawfull meanes.
Indeed the worldlings excuse is, that
food and raiment is his liuing, which he
must needs looke vnto: but we must still
remember, that our life standeth not in
these things, for when death comes, these
cannot saue vs from the graue: it is Gods
blessing by which we liue, hee can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
vs aboue meanes, nay without
meanes, and against meanes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee must neuer giue place to such
thoughts and cares as shew distrust in
God.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, hence wee must learne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation
and patience in extreame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty
and in all other miseries of this
life; If God should deale with vs as hee
did with his seruant Iob: if for our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
hee should bring vpon vs the losse
of goods, of children, of health and all
that we haue, with banishment also from
our friends and country, yet then must
we labour to shew the fruit of patience,
and not suffer our harts to be swallowed
vp of ouermuch griefe: because our life
stands by Gods word, and not in any of
these things: indeed, if in these outward
miseries a man should be depriued of
the comfort of Gods prouidence, then
might he sorrow without measure: but
seeing all such as feare God doe still en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
the blessing of God in their greatest
calamities (for Gods blessing is not loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
vp in bread, but aboue means, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
meanes and against meanes can he
manifest his power and goodnesse in
their preseruation) therefore in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of euil must wee comfort our
selues <hi>in the Lord our God,</hi> as<note n="c" place="margin">1. Sam. 30. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Dauid did
in great sorrow,</hi> hauing lost his two wiues
and being in danger to be stoned of his
owne followers: and learne to say with
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:16197:18"/>
Iob,<note n="d" place="margin">Iob. 13. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Though the Lord kill me yet will I
trust in him.</hi> What if the Lord should
send a famine among vs, as he may iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
do for the sinnes of this land? should
we then despaire or vse vnlawful meanes
for our reliefe? nay, then we must learne
Moses lesson, <hi>that man liueth not by bread
only,</hi> and labour to depend on him that
can increase<note n="e" place="margin">1. King. 17. 14.</note> 
               <hi>the oile in the poore widowes
cruise and the meale in the barrels,</hi> till
plenty come.</p>
            <p>Seuenthly, this must teach vs mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of our affections in all estates that
do befall vs; in health and plenty wee
must not be puffed vp with pride; in
weakenesse and in want wee must not be
oppressed with sorrow; for mans life
standeth not in these things, neither can
we heereby know loue or hatred; he that
is in want may haue as good a portion in
Gods blessing as the wealthiest in the
world, heerein<note n="f" place="margin">Luk. 16. 19. 20.</note> hungry <hi>Lazarus</hi> full of
fores, went farre beyond the <hi>rich glutton</hi>
in all his riot.</p>
            <p>Lastly, seeing our life depends vpon
Gods word, we must heereby learne to
acknowledge Gods prouidence, and to
rely thereupon in all estates. In the daies
of peace, wherein (as<note n="g" place="margin">Iob. 29. 6.</note> Iob speaketh of
himselfe) <hi>men wash their paths in butter,
and haue the rockes to powre them out riuers
of oile,</hi> men will soone be brought to say
so much; but we must labour to see and
feele the blessing of his prouidence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
then when we tread (as it were) the
winepresse of his wrath: as well in sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
as in health: in want as in plenty;
in the depth of distresse as in the height
of all prospetity: this is the counsell of
the Holy ghost,<note n="h" place="margin">Prou. 16. 3.</note> 
               <hi>rolle thy workes vpon the
Lord. Cast all your care vpon him, for he
careth for you,</hi> 1. Pet. 5. 7. It is a brutish
property only to looke vpon the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
whereon they feed, and therefore
our eies and our hearts must be fixed on
him who <hi>feedeth the yong rauens that crie
vnto him; and beareth vp all things by his
mighty word:</hi> wee must not content our
selues with a bare speculation heereof in
our heads, but labour to feele the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of it in our hearts, and to expresse
the power of it in our liues. And thus
much for the first conflict.</p>
            <q>
               <bibl>VERS. 5.</bibl>
               <p>Then the Diuell tooke him vp
into the holy city, and set him on a pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
of the Temple.</p>
               <p>6. And said vnto him, if thou be the son of
God cast thy selfe down a for it is<note n="*" place="margin">Ps. 91. 11. 12.</note> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
that he will giue his Angels charge
ouer thee, and with their hands they shall
lift thee vp, lest at any time thou shouldst
dash thy foot against a stone.</p>
               <p>7. Iesus said vnto him: it is<note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 6. 16.</note> written againe,
thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</p>
            </q>
            <p>THese words containe the second
conflict of Satan with our Sauiour
Christ: for howsoeuer by Saint Luke
this is put in the third place, which Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew
heere placeth in the second, yet
this breedeth no difference betweene
the Euangelists, who tie not themselues
to a strict obseruation of time, place,
and order how euery thing was done
which they relate; as in the story of this
conflict, Saint Luke respects the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of it onely, but S. Matthew ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues
the order of it also. Now in this
second conflict we are to obserue three
points: I. Satans preparation thereto:
II. The assault it selfe: III. Christs
answer and repulse thereof.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>Point:</hi> Satans preparation to this
conflict is conteined in the 5. verse:
wherein we are to note, both the <hi>time,</hi>
and the <hi>parts</hi> thereof; The <hi>time</hi> in the
first word <hi>Then:</hi> that is, so soone as the
Diuell had receiued a foile of Christ in
his first assault, presently hee addresseth
himselfe vnto a second.</p>
            <p>Heerein behold, the exceeding ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of Satan, in that the end of one tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
with him, is but the beginning
of another; he ceaseth not with one as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault,
but as hee is a deadly foe to the
Church of God, so he shewes himselfe
by his continuall seeking whom he may
deuour; he will neuer make truice with
any child of God, vpon any condition
lesse than the hazard of his soule; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is he weary of his worke; but day
and night is either plotting or perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
some mischieuous attempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the child of God. The considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereof must teach vs, vpon our
victorie and conquest ouer one tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:16197:19"/>
presently to prepare for a new.
This was the state of the sonne of God
our head, and we his members may not
looke for better; our life in this vale of
teares is a continuall warfare against the
enemies of our soules; we must not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
heere looke for rest and ease, but
euer keepe watch and ward against their
assaults. If this duty were well learned
and put in practise, it would preuent
much impatience &amp; become the ground
of much peace in our soules: mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
cannot brooke the doubling and
renuing of sorrowes; when one euill
lights in the necke of another, oh then
hee thinketh neuer any was in his case;
but looke vnto Iesus the author and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisher
of thy faith, he endured no lesse;
and heerein he is an example that thou
shouldest follow his steps. If therefore
thou wilt be his disciple, prepare to take
vp thy crosse<note n="a" place="margin">Luk. 9. 23.</note> 
               <hi>euery day and follow him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The parts of Satans preparation are
two; First, he conuaies Christ from Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem
to the wildernesse; Secondly,
hee placeth him on a pinnacle of the
temple. For the first, in these words, <hi>The
diuell tooke him vp into the holy city,</hi> that is,
into Ierusalem, as Luke expoundeth it,
<hi>chap.</hi> 4. 9. This the Diuell might doe
three waies; In vision; or leading him
vp the ordinary way; or carrying him
through the aire. I. It might be in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
for that was vsuall with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;
so<note n="b" place="margin">Ier. 13. 4.</note> Ieremie went to the <hi>riuen Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath;</hi>
and Ezekiel was carried from Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopotamia
to<note n="c" place="margin">Ezek. 8. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> but Christ was
not thus transported; for then Satans
perswasion vnto Christ <hi>To cast himselfe
downe,</hi> could haue beene no temptation.
II. Christ might bee led of the Diuell
the ordinary way from the wildernesse
to Ierusalem, so much the words will
beare: but (as I take it) he went not so;
for if Christ were ledde by the Diuell, it
was either willingly of his owne accord,
or by the Diuels perswasion; but of his
owne accord he would not goe; for hee
came into the wildernesse to bee tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted,
which as yet was not fully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished,
and therefore would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
depart thence before that worke
for which he came were ended, Againe,
he would not depart thence vpon the
Diuels perswasion; for Christ would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
gratifie the Diuell so much, as to do
ought himselfe, which the Diuell would
haue him, as in all his temptations doth
appeare;<note place="margin">Rule. Do nothing Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan perswades thee to in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation.</note> for this is a rule to be obserued,
we must not do any thing which the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
perswades vs to in his temptations,
though in it selfe the thing be lawful and
good. III. The Diuell might carry the
body of our Sauiour Christ thorow the
aire, by his power through Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.
This is the most likely way, &amp;
so thought to be of the best diuines: and
the words following confirme it much,
for it is said, <hi>the Diuell set him on a pinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of the temple:</hi> Now if hee had power
to set him there, why might hee not also
cary him thither, God ordaining this as
well as his temptation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The vse.</hi> By this we see, that men may
be transported by the Diuell from place
to place, as the records of all ages do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port:
this one thing yet obserued (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the common opinion faileth) that the
Diuell cannot conuey a man aliue so far
in a little time, as many men thinke; as
a thousand or two thousand miles in an
houre; for no man is able to endure such
violent motion and yet liue, as experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
teacheth; let a man fall from some
high steeple, and his breath wilbe gone
and hee dead before hee come at the
ground, by reason of the violence of his
motion. Indeed the Diuell can carrie a
man very swiftly, but yet for the safetie
of mans life he must prolong his time far
more, than otherwise of himselfe hee
needs to doe.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Satans power <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>

                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> if God permit.</note> hence wee learne that by
Gods permission, the Diuell may haue
power ouer the bodies of Gods owne
children which are true beleeuers, to
transport them from place to place; for
dealing thus with the head Christ Iesus,
why may hee not doe so with any of his
members? besides, we find (that God
permitting him) hee hath done more
than this to the Saints of God; hee may
possesse their bodies, as he did the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of Canaans daughter, Mat. 15. 22.
He may torment them long, as hee did
exceeding grieuously bow the body of
a daughter of Abraham eighteen years,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 13, 16. Yea he may kill the body,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:16197:19"/>
as he did to Iobs children, who no doubt
were holy persons, Iob. 1. 19. And
therefore much more may hee transport
them from place to place.</p>
            <p>Heere this question may fitly be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered:
whether a true beleeuer may be
bewitched. <hi>Answ.</hi> Hee may: there is
none vpon earth so faithfull and holy,
but if God permit, Satan can afflict their
bodies grieuously, and therefore also
they may be bewitched. It is but the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of presumptuous persons, when they
say, their faith is so strong, that all
the witches in the world cannot hurt
them: for if God permit, Satan can grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously
afflict mans body, as he did the
body of Iob. yea he can kil the body, as
hath been shewed. Salomon, speaking of
outward things saith truly,<note n="a" place="margin">Eccles. 9. 2.</note> All things
come alike to all, and the same conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is to the iust and to the wicked: now
the wicked man may be bewitched, as al
will grant; why then may not the godly
also, seeing it is but an outward euill?
This therfore must abate their pride that
stand so much on their strong faith: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
this fact of Satan to the holy body
of Christ, and heereby learne for thy
humiliation, that if God permit, Satan
is able to bring vpon thy body great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</p>
            <p>Further, obserue the place whither
Satan caries our Sauiour Christ, <hi>into the
holy city,</hi> that is, <hi>Ierusalem. Quest.</hi> Why
is it called <hi>holy,</hi> seeing now it was a pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
place full of sinful people? <hi>Answ.</hi>
It is called <hi>holy</hi> for these causes. 1. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
heere was the Lords temple the
place of his solemne worship, wherein
were the holy rites and ceremonies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
for Gods worship. Secondly, in
Ierusalem, as also in all the synagogues
of Iudea, was Moses chaire, the law
and the Prophets were read &amp; expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
Thirdlie, Ierusalem was the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
City of all the world in respect of
religion; heere God ordained that his
church should first be planted, and from
hence must religion bee deriued to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The vse.</hi> Hence we may obserue, that
at this time Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was the true church
of God: indeed it was very corrupt
both for doctrine and maners, as Christs
seuere reproofe of both doth plainely
shew, Mat. 5. 21. &amp;c. and Mat. 23. 13.
14. &amp;c. and yet a true Church, else the
holy ghost would not haue called it <hi>the
holy city.</hi> Now if Ierusalem at this time
were the true church of God then, then
may wee well say, that in England God
hath his true church: for, let the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of our Church bee as they are;
yet shall it match Ierusalem in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiues
of Gods church. They had the
law and the Prophets read and expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
so haue wee, and the Gospel also
which is the power of God to mans sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.
They had the Sacraments and
ceremonies of the Law; answerable
thereto wee haue the Sacraments of the
Gospell, and also a true and holy forme
of seruing God. Their Ierusalem was a
mother city; and though wee cannot
say so much in that behalfe, yet hath
our Church beene a nurce to neighbour
Churches in <hi>Germany, France</hi> and other
places round about, for many yeares;
in regard whereof, the Lord, no doubt,
hath bestowed many blessings vpon vs.
And therefore though our sinnes and
abuses be many and grieuous, yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of Church prerogatiues we may be
called a holy nation, and a true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Church of God; so that as our
Sauiour Christ and his Disciples ioined
themselues to the congregations of the
Iewes in their legal seruice, and forsooke
them not till they became no Church;
so ought it to be among vs, till we sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from Christ, none should seuer
themselues from our church ministery &amp;
seruice of God. Those therefore that
make a separation from our Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of corruptions in it, are farre from
the spirit of Christ and his Apostles. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
shal say, this makes wel for the church
of Rome, if so corrupt a place as Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
in regard of Church prerogatiues
were an holie city, for they haue as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
prerogatiues for religion, as the Iewes
then had, and therefore are the church
of God, and so we do not well to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from them. <hi>Answ.</hi> Some indeed
that are no Papists, say the Church of
Rome is the Church of God: but the
truth is, the present Church of Rome is
spirituall <hi>Babylon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rome is Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Babylon.</note> the mother of abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:16197:20"/>
no spouse of Christ but a
strumpet. But they plead their preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues:
as first, their succession from Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
Secondly, true baptisme for substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
according to the first institution: Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Apostles Creed which they hold
and beleeue: Fourthly, the word of God,
in the writings of the Prophets &amp; Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles:
And Lastly, that theirs is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
church. <hi>Answ.</hi> All this is nothing
when the truth appeares; for first, succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in person without succession in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
is no note of a church: now let
them shew succession in the Apostles do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and we yeeld. Secondly, their
baptisme alone, though for substance
true baptisme, cannot prooue them a
true Church: Circumcision was the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of Gods church, yet Samaria
and Colchis were not the Church of
God, though they vsed it: againe, the
thiefe may shew the true mans purse, but
that proueth him not to be true and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest;
no more doth baptisme iustifie the
church of Rome to bee a true church.
Lastly, though they haue outward bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
yet indeed they ouerthrow inward
baptisme, the life of that sacrament, to
wit, imputed righteousnesse and renued
holinesse, which in Gods Church must
goe together with the outward element,
else it is nothing. Thirdly, for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
Creed, they haue it in word, but
they deny it in deede; For though they
say, <hi>they beleeue in God the father,</hi> and <hi>in
Iesus Christ,</hi> yet in effect they deny both
God and Christ. For the God of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
is an idol God, and the Christ of the
Papists a false Christ, as we haue shewed
in handling of the Creed. Fourthly, for
the scripture; wee must know the word
of God stands not in bare words and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
but in the true sense and meaning of
the Holy ghost contained in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of the Prophets and Apostles.
Now though they haue the bookes of
Scripture, yet in sundry main grounds of
religion, they ouerthrow the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Prophets and Apostles. Again,
they keep the scripture as a lantern holds
a candle, not for it selfe but for passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:
so is the scripture with them, not
for their synagogue, but for Gods secret
ones among them, for euen in the midst
of Poperie hath God euer had some of
his elect, who haue not embraced
their cursed doctrine. Lastly, for their
plea to be the <hi>mother Church;</hi> we must
distinguish between the ancient Church
of Rome, and the strumpet that now is;
the ancient Church of Rome to whom
Paul writ, was a true and famous church,
and a mother Church; but she is now
dead and buried; and the now Roman
Church is no mother Church, no
spouse of Christ, but the <hi>whore of Babel</hi>
the <hi>mother of abhominations,</hi> from which
we are commanded to depart, <hi>Reuelat.</hi>
18. 4.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Vse.</note> in that Christ is brought to
Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that holy City, there to be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted,
wee learne, that no holinesse of
place on earth can debarre the Diuell
from his temptations; he brings Christ
from the wildernesse to tempt him, in
the holy city euen vpon the holy temple
hee will thrust himselfe<note n="a" place="margin">Zak. 3. 1.</note> on <hi>Iehoshuahs
right hand to resist him,</hi> though Iehoshuah
stand before the Angell of the Lord to
minister to the Lord. And therefore the
follie of Papists is egregious, that thinke
the signe of the crosse, holy water, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,
and such Massing inchantments
haue vertue in them to free their houses,
or their bodies fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the assaults of Satan.</p>
            <p>Lastly, heereby wee see that change
of place is but a sillie cure for a troubled
mind; indeed change of aire may much
further bodily cures; but a troubled
mind hath conflicts with the diuel, who
will not leaue for change of place, Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem
will fit his turne as well as the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse.</p>
            <p>The second part of the Diuels pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
to this conflict is this, <hi>and set
him on a pinnacle of the temple:</hi> The word
translated <hi>pinnacle,</hi> signifieth properly a
<hi>wing</hi> of the temple; whereby, some take
to be meant, the sharpe brouches and
spires on the top of the temple; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
there were diuers; but these (as I take
it) are not heere meant; for such a spire
cannot wel be called a wing; others take
it for some part of the battlement, made
on the top of the Temple, which was
flat, as the Iewes vsed to build, to keepe
men from falling; others take it for any
top corner of the Temples; and whether
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:16197:20"/>
of these it was we cannot certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine;
but this we must holde, that it was
some dangerous steepe downe place on
some corner of the Temple, or on the
battlements, from which a man might
easily cast himselfe; whereby we see the
Diuell will omit no aduantage that may
further his temptations; which should
make vs the more carefull of our stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
against him.</p>
            <q>
               <bibl>VERSE 6.</bibl>
               <p>And said vnto him, If thou be
the sonne of God cast thy selfe downe: for
it is written, that he wil giue his Angels
charge ouer thee, and with their hands
they shall lift thee vp, lest at any time
thou shouldst dash thy foot against a stone.</p>
            </q>
            <p>THese wordes containe the second
maine point in this conflict, to wit,
Satans assault vpon Christ: wherein we
are to obserue, first his temptation: then
the reason whereby he doth enforce it.
His temptation heere is framed as the
former was, in a kind of reasoning, thus:</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <p>If thou be the sonne of God, then shew the
same by casting thy selfe downe from
this pinnacle of the temple:</p>
                  <p>But as I see thou art certainly perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that thou art the sonne of God:
Therefore cast thy selfe downe, and
thereby declare it.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing this is a distinct temptation
from the former, I doubt not but it
must be thus framed with this conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
for if it had the same conclusion
with the former it should be the same
temptation. Satans meaning then is this,
as if he had said; I haue made triall to
see expresly whether thou be the sonne
of God or not, and it seemes thou doest
vndoubtedly beleeue that voice of thy
father to be true, which said, <hi>This is my
welbeloued sonne in whom I am wel pleased:</hi>
Now if this be so indeed, it is conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
thou shouldest confirme the same by
some miracle, and the fittest place thou
canst doe it in, is this; therefore cast thy
selfe downe headlong from this pinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
and yet preserue thy selfe in safety
without all hurt in the fall.</p>
            <p>The drift of Satan in this temptation
was, to bring our Sauior Christ to a vaine
confidence in his Fathers protection,
and indeed to flat presumption vpon his
extraordinarie prouidence in the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of lawfull ordinary means, as by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
conclusion, &amp; the answer of Christ
will easily appeare.<note place="margin">Satan seeks to cary men to presumption.</note> And hereby we may
obserue that one maine drift of Satan in
his ordinarie temptations in Gods
church, is to carry men to presumption,
and vaine confidence in the loue, fauor,
and mercy of God: this appeares by the
strange reasonings for libertie in sinne
which many frame to themselues, and
some are not ashamed to vtter; as first,
God is mercifull, and Christ shedde his
bloud for their redemption, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they will not be so strict and precise
in hearing sermons, and reading &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
about the word as many are, but
they wil take the pleasures and seeke the
profits of this life. Thus reasoned some
in the Apostles daies:<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 6. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Let vs continue
in sin that grace may abound:</hi> of such Iude
complaineth, saying,<note n="b" place="margin">Iude 4.</note> 
               <hi>They turne the
grace of God into wantonnesse.</hi> Such there
haue beene euer since, &amp; at this day they
doe euerie where abound. Secondly,
some say, they are either ordained to
saluation or damnation; now if to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they are sure of it how euer they
liue; and if to damnation, they cannot
escape it, though they liue neuer so holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for Gods decree is vnchangeable;
and therfore they will take their pleasure
and liue as they list. Thirdly others say
they haue euer found Gods goodnesse
towards them, and they are perswaded
he will neuer see them want, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they will not toile themselues with
labor &amp; care as others do, but take their
ease and pleasure while they may haue
it; and so neglect their charge and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and giue themselues wholly to
their sports and pleasures, to company
keeping or such like. Yea, by this temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to presumption, Satan oft pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes
with the better sort; for if a man
fauour the trueth, and giue himselfe to
know religion in any sort, the Diuell will
straight way go about to perswade him,
that that which he doth is sufficient to
his saluation, &amp; thus wil keepe him from
vsing further means to come by the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
knowledge of his election, and full
affiance in Christ Iesus, to become a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16197:21"/>
perfect man in Christ, which is the end
of Gods holy ministery, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 13.
whereunto we should giue all diligence,
2. Pet. 1. 10. See the truth heereof in the
fine foolish virgins, who carried<note n="a" place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tth. 25. 1. 2. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>burning
lamps, but tooke no oile with them,</hi> neuer
minding that till it was too late; and so
doe most men content themselues with
the blazing lampe of an outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
neuer looking for the oile of
grace, till the time of grace he past.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The vse.</hi> Heereby then wee are all
taught, in speciall maner to beware of
presumption; this is the common snare
of the Diuel wherein he intangles many
a soule. It is true indeed that he oft pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes
by bringing men to desperation,
but a thousand perish through presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
almost for one by desperation;
for despaire is a painfull thing to flesh
and bloud, and as the Diuell knowes
well, doth sometimes turne to a mans
more sound conuersion; but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
is sweet and pleasant to the flesh,
and most agreeable to mans corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
in regard whereof wee ought to
keepe out heart with all watch &amp; ward,
as Dauid praieth, <hi>Keepe thy seruant from
presumptuous sinnes, Ps.</hi> 19. 13.</p>
            <p>Againe, obserue the order of Satans
temptations by comparing this with the
former. There he sought to ouerthrow
Christs faith &amp; to bring him to distrust
the trueth of Gods word vttered from
heauen; but finding hee could not that
way preuaile, heere he takes the cleane
contrary course, and seekes to bring him
to presume.</p>
            <p>This serues to discouer vnto vs, the
deepe guile and subtilty of the Diuell,<note place="margin">Satans cunning in tempting.</note>
that can so cunningly turn himselfe from
one extreame vnto another. And looke
as he dealeth here with Christ the head,
so doth hee continue towards all his
members, if he cannot bring them to
one extreame, he will assay them hard in
the other. If hee cannot bring a man to
couetousnesse, and keepe his heart to
the loue of money, then let him beware
of riot and prodigality. Is a man giuen
to pleasures and delight, and an length is
depriued of them? then let him beware;
the Diuell swallow him not vp with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermuch
griefe, as he sought to do with
the<note n="a" place="margin">2. Cor. 2. 7. 11.</note> 
               <hi>incestuous person</hi> of Corinth. Doth
a man come to loue religion, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
was giuen to loosenesse of life?
then if it be possible the Diuell will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
him to schisme &amp; heresie. The Diuel
cannot abide that a man should keepe
the meane according to Gods word,
<hi>Isay</hi> 30. 21. He would haue our first pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
to be <hi>Gods,</hi> or no body, <hi>Gene.</hi> 3. 5.
And so still he laboureth to bring a man
to some extreame. We therefore in all
estates during life, must labour to keepe
the golden meane, as Christ heere did,
neither doubting on the one hand nor
presuming on the other, but retaining
still that blessed faith, whereby his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
heart was firmly setled in these as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults.
Thus much for Satans drift.
Now come to the words of this temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If thou be the sonne of God, then cast thy
selfe downe:</hi> that is, shew by this miracle
that thou art the sonne of God. Marke
here, the Diuell perswades him not, to
shew himselfe to be the sonne of God
by doctrine in the execution of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie;
but <hi>Cast thy selfe downe,</hi> shew a
miracle: wherein we may beholde the
very liuely image of that naturall dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
which is in all impenitent persons;
they affect Christes miracles, but they
care not for his doctrine. Herod longed
to see <hi>Christ,</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Luk, 23. 8.</note>
               <hi>and was glad of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,</hi>
when Pilate sent him; yet not to
heare his doctrine, for that he could not
endure; els he would not haue impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Iohn, and also put him to death;
but <hi>he hoped to see a miracle.</hi> The wicked
Iewes desire a signe, that put Christ to
death for his doctrine; yet <hi>if be will come
downe from the crosse,</hi> and so miraculous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
saue himselfe, then <hi>they will beleeue,
Mark.</hi> 15. 32. And this venom of the
olde serpent hath poisoned the hearts of
many students in the Scriptures, who
care not at all to ground themselues in
the fundamentall points of religion, as
faith and repentance; and yet are woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
eager after quidditles and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
wherein may appeare some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
shew of wit and learning; like the
hypocriticall <hi>Pharisies,</hi> that would <hi>tithe
mint and rue, and yet passe ouer iudgement
and the loue of God, Luk.</hi> 11. 42. And the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:16197:21"/>
cause hereof is the want of sound grace,
for naturall men indeed can not sauour
the things of the spirit of God; the
knowledge of Christ crucified seemes
foolishnesse vnto them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Diuell tooke occasion
of his former temptation from Christs
infirmitie of hunger: but perceiuing
Christs sure faith in his fathers word by
his gratious answer to that assault, heere
he borrowes his temptation from that
profession of his faith; as if he should
say, thou seemest to be resolued of the
trueth of thy fathers word that thou art
the sonne of God; and if that be true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
then shew it by this miracle, <hi>Cast
thy selfe downe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heere then behold another tricke of
Satan; if he cannot preuaile by assaults
drawen from our infirmities, then will he
assay vs by temptations drawen from
Gods good gifts and graces in vs; If he
cannot keepe a man in ignorance that
hath good gifts of wit &amp; memory, then
will hee seeke from his knowledge to
puffe him vp with pride, and so ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
his poison with Gods good gifts,
doth cause many a one to become a bane
to Gods church, that otherwise might
haue prooued an excellent instrument
therein; as might easily be shewed in
sundry particulars.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Satans malice restrained.</note> heere marke how Satans ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
is restrained, and his power limited:
By Gods permission he is able to carrie
Christ from the wildernes to Ierusalem,
and there to set him in a most dangerous
place on a wing of the temple; the thing
hee now desireth is his destruction by
casting downe head long, but that he can
not doe, and therefore perswades Christ
to cast himself down; wherein we see the
speciall prouidence of God ouer Christ
Iesus in all these temptations, restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his enemy in the thing he most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired.
And the same prouidence doth
he still continue ouer his Church for the
effectuall preseruation of Christs mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
in all their temptations. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels
vnwearied desire &amp; drift is, to bring
contentions, hurliburlies and ruines into
all societies in Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;
therfore the peace and tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of these is, and so must bee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
a notable fruit of Gods blessed
prouidence restraining the spite and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of Satan. Againe, hence it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that in temptation Satan cannot go
beyond the permission of God: he can
tempt Christ, yea transport his body, and
set him in a dangerous place, for thus far
God permits him to goe; but to cast
Christ downe from the pinnacle he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
therein comes Gods restraint. So it
fareth with Gods children; for the triall
of his graces in them, and to chastise
them for some sinnes, he suffers Satan to
buffet them; but yet one iotte of his
malice beyond Gods permission he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
shew,<note place="margin">Iob. 1. 12.</note> as in Iobs affliction by him
may notably appeare. Which wee must
carefully remember for our special com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in our most grieuous assaults; Gods
will permitting Satan so farre must make
vs patient, and yet his power restraining
Satan from doing worse, must giue vs
comfort. Thus much for the temptation
itselfe.</p>
            <p>The reason whereby Satan enforceth
his temptation is taken from a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Scripture: <hi>For it is written he shall
giue his Angels charge ouer thee, &amp;c.</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
hearing Christ alledge scripture for
his defence against the first assault,
comes now vpon him with his owne
weapon, that if it were possible he might
foile him, after this sort: <hi>Thou shewest
thy selfe to be the Doctor of the Church, by
thine alleadging of Scripture, and that, it
seemes, thou makest the rule of thine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:
well then thou maiest well and
safely cast thy selfe downe hence if thou bee
the Sonne of God, for it is written, he shall
giue his Angels charge ouer thee, and with
their hands they shall lift thee vp &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this dealing of Satan, wee are
taught, not to embrace an opinion in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
because a shew of proofe by testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Scripture may bee giuen for it.
But <hi>we must trie the spirits,</hi> that is, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of men, <hi>whether they be of God, or
not, 1. Ioh.</hi> 4. 1. For the Diuell can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge
Scripture to mooue Christ vnto
presumption, and it is his vsuall practise,
when he caries men into schisms, errors,
and heresies. Reason with a man that
minds to liue in sinne, and tell him of
that dangerous state, by reason of the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16197:22"/>
shortnesse and vncertainty of this life:
will he not tell you straight, he will doe
as he does, and repent when he is old?
for it is written,<note n="a" place="margin">Ezek. 18. 17.</note> 
               <hi>At what time soeuer a
sinner doth repent him of his sinne, I will
put all his wickednesse out of my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
saith the Lord:</hi> And some thinke
three or foure good words at a mans
last end wil serue his turne: for the thiefe
on the crosse said no more, but,<note n="b" place="margin">Luk. 23. 42.</note> 
               <hi>Lord
remember me when thou comest into thy
kingdome.</hi> And all such as are trained
vp in the schoole of Satan, can easilie
alledge scripture to further them in euil.</p>
            <p>But let vs come to the scripture which
the Diuel doth notoriously abuse by his
allegation: it is written in the 91. <hi>Ps. v.</hi>
11. In the alledging whereof he would
seeme very carefull and precise, at the
first not omitting so much as this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
[<hi>for</hi>] which might haue beene left
out, and yet nothing haue been wanting
to the force of his reason: But heerein is
the deepenesse of his policy, to cause
Christ not to suspect any falshood after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
for towards the end, hee leaueth
out that, on which the promise is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of being kept by the Angel: to wit,
<hi>to keepe thee in all thy waies,</hi> that is, in all
the good duties of thy lawfull calling
wherein thou shalt glorifie God and
doe good to others; to such as so walke
in their waies doth that promise belong.</p>
            <p>Heere then behold Satans notable<note place="margin">Satans mincing of the word of God.</note>
fraud and craft, that can so cunninglie
leaue out that which makes not for his
purpose, and so peruert the true meaning
of scripture; this is his vsuall practise, in
enmity against the word to depraue the
true meaning by cutting off some part,
when hee cannot vtterly ouerthrow the
whole. The like is the dealing of all he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes,
who by cutting off and leauing
out, play legerdemaine with the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
The Arrian holds the Bible for the
word of God; but such places as serue to
proue the godhead of Christ, he doth
notably abuse and peruert. The familie
of Loue also, doth hold the bible for the
word of God; but come to the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it, therein they faile, turning all
into Allegories, euen most true histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
as the fall of our first Parents, and
such like, which are maine grounds of
religion in their naturall sense: and the
Apostaticall Church of Rome, doth
hold with vs the bookes of the old and
new Testament; but yet they put in and
take out at their pleasure, and take from
it all sense and meaning which agrees
not with the determination of their holy
father the Pope; and thereby they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerturne
the word of God, and strongly
maintaine their mystery of iniquity.</p>
            <p>This dealing of Satan and his wicked
miscreants with the scripture, must make
all Gods children willing to spend their
strength in searching out the Scripture;
for that is the onely way to descrie their
fraude in deprauing of it. This caused
Christ to bidde the people in his time
to search the Scriptures, to learne to
know him to bee the true Messias,
which the Iewish teachers did then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
In regard whereof wee must say
with<note n="a" place="margin">Num. 11. 29.</note> Moses, <hi>oh that all the Lords people
were Prophets, and that the Lord would
put his spirit vpon them!</hi> oh that all
could reade and vnderstand the word
of God! This is it, wherein all that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be, or intend to be ministers must
labour especially, euen to get sound
knowledge and iudgement in the text of
Scripture. The Minister must not only
be able to teach the truth, but also to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerne,
to discouer, and to confure er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
and heresies, which hee can neuer
foundly doe without good vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in the text it selfe. The Diuell
knowes the whole Scripture, and he will
spare no text therein it hee can corrupt
it; therfore to resoue Gods truth out of
his hands who is the father of lies, the
Minister must shew himselfe a good
souldier of Iesus Christ, as Paul exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
Timothy, giuing such attendance
to the word that all men may see his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting
therein; yea with Ieremie, the
Minister must eat the bookes of God,
and digest them in his vnderstanding,
and rejoice therein, labouring to feele
them the joy of his heart. The Diuell
knowes that Scripture truely vnderstood
and well applied, is the onely engine for
the battery of his kingdome; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
euen from the beginning, but spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
since the comming of Christ hee
hath laboured by all meanes to keepe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16197:22"/>
men from the knowledge and true vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of them: hee it is that hath
brought men from the reading of the
Scriptures, to betake themselues to the
writings of men, as schoolemen, fathers,
and such; by this meanes hee hath for
many yeares euen to this day in the
Church of Rome, locked vp the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in an vnknowen tongue: yea euen
in Gods church the Diuel works migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
this way, by stealing away the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of yong students from the Bible,
and rauishing them with delight in the
writings of men; for thus he keeps them
from the fountaine of truth, that they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fal into error themselues, or be lesse
able to discerne and confute it in others.
And hence come dissentions and errors
into the schooles of the Prophets, which
cannot be auoided while men leaue the
text of scripture &amp; addict themselues so
much to the writings of men, for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
hee can more cunningly conuey
strange conceits into mens minds: and
therfore euery one that would maintain
the truth in purity and syncerity must la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
painfully in the text.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Gods ministers must heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
be admonished, to be carefull in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging
any text of Scripture, that the
same be fit and pertinent: for to wrest
the same from the proper meaning of
the holy Ghost to serue their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
is the practise of Satan, which euery
seruant of God must be farre from, and
therefore must not do it hand ouer head.
Which also may serue for a good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertisement
to those that vse to heape vp
manifold allegations of Scriptures in the
doctrine of a sermon, for as<note n="a" place="margin">Prou. 10. 19.</note> 
               <hi>in many
words there cannot want iniquity,</hi> as <hi>Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi>
saith; so in affected multiplicity of quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
can the abuse of Scripture bee
hardly escaped. If we deliuer but a mans
testimony, honesty will compell vs as
neere as we can to keepe both his words
and his meaning; much more should
conscience moue vs in alledging the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of the Lord, to haue carefull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the euidence of truth: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that sparing course is very commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable,
whereby in quoting of Scripture
men make sure to keepe themselues to
the Lords true meaning, lest by depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
his word they become followers of
Satan: And thus much for the maner of
Satans allegation.</p>
            <p>The true and proper meaning of that
text is now briefly to be discussed. The
<hi>ninety-one Psalme,</hi> from whence it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
is a most heauenly part of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
penned for the comfort of Gods
people in the time of some grieuous
plague or sickenesse; and it containes a
notable preseruatiue against the plague,
and by consequent against any iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, to wit, <hi>true affiance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in the Lord,</hi> that is the ground of
all comfortable safety; thereto, among
many other, is<note n="a" place="margin">Vers. 11.</note> this gratious promise
made of the protection of Gods holy
Angels, (which the Diuell doth heere
alledge) who shall be as carefull for the
safety of Gods children in common ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
of famine, plague, pestilence
&amp;c. as the nurce is ouer her tender child
to hold it in her hands, and beare it vp in
her armes, lest it should fall and hurt it
selfe; alwaies prouided that the child of
God keepe himselfe in his waies, that is,
in obedience to Gods commandements
and in the duties of his lawfull calling.
It is true indeed, <hi>that iudgement begins at</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Pet. 4. 17.</note>
               <hi>the house of God, and the righteous are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away from the euill to come,</hi> yea many
times the same outward iudgement
lights vpon the good, that doeth vpon
the bad: yet this taketh not from Gods
child the comfort of this protection in
common calamities, for all promises of
temporall blessings must be vnderstood
with the <hi>exception of the crosse:</hi> as heere,
Gods Angels shall guard his children in
time of plague, famine and pestilence,
vnlesse it please God heerewith to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
them for some sinne past, or to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
some sin, or greater euill to come,
or to make triall of their faith and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
in which cases also the child of
God doth greatly differ from the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked;
for through the fruition of Gods
loue in Christ the euill of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is taken away, and the outward
smart thereof<note n="b" place="margin">See Iob. 23. 10. Ps. 119. 71.</note> sanctified to the greater
good of his soule: but out of this case
their protection is certaine: see Exod. 12.
23. Psal. 105. 16. 17. &amp; Ezek. 9. 4. 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The vse.</hi> The consideration of this
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16197:23"/>
gratious protection of Gods Angels o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
such as keepe themselues in their
waies, must moue euery one to labour to
know and practise the duties of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
both generall of Christianity, and
particular for the state of his life, in all
good conscience; so doing, let come
what will, in all dangers hee shall haue
safety; for Gods angels pitch their tents
about him, they are as watchfull ouer
him as a nurce ouer her child; but if wee
forsake our waies wee lose the comfort
of their protection, &amp; expose our selues
to all Gods iudgements.</p>
            <q>
               <bibl>VERSE 7.</bibl>
               <p>Iesus said vnto him, Againe
it is written, Thou shalt not tempt the
Lord thy God.</p>
            </q>
            <p>HEere is the third generall point in
this conflict: to wit, Christs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
and repulse made to Satans assault,
taken, as the Diuels temptation was,
from a text of scripture; for hee saith,
<hi>Againe it is written;</hi> where yet hee mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
not to oppose scripture to scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
but to confute the abuse of scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
by scripture; after this sort, as if he
had said to Satan, It is true indeed that
God hath made many worthy promises
of aid and protection to his children in
his word, yet they shal not be performed
to those that presume to <hi>tempt God,</hi> as
thou wouldest haue me to do.</p>
            <p>From this dealing of Christ with Satan<note place="margin">Scriptures are sufficient to expound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</note>
we may obserue; that the scriptures of
God are sufficient in themselues, truely
to interpret and expound themselues.
The Diuel alledging scripture did wrest
it from the true sense; this our Sauiour
Christ sheweth by alledging another
text out of<note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 6. 16.</note> Moses, which being appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the place which the Diuel abused,
doth shew the true meaning thereof. So
Ezra, expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the law vnto the Iews,
<hi>read distinctly in the law of God, and</hi> (as the
words do signifie)<note n="b" place="margin">Ezra. 8. 8.</note> 
               <hi>gaue the sense by scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
and caused the people to vnderstand:</hi>
much more then at this day may the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
be thought sufficient for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
of themselues, sith to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
there of since <hi>Ezra</hi> his time there is
added the whole new Testament by
the hand of God, wherein the deepe
things of God are plainelie reuealed.</p>
            <p>The Church of Rome cannot away
with this, that Scripture should be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to expound it selfe. And therefore
against it they reason thus: <hi>That which
must expound Scripture, must haue iudiciall
power to determine of the sense thereof: but
the scriptures haue no such ludiciall power;</hi>
for they are but a dumb letter, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no sufficient iudge to determine of
their owne sense and meaning. <hi>Answ.</hi>
The Scriptures haue iudiciall power to
determine of their owne true sense and
meaning, for they speake euidently, to
all that are inlightned by Gods spirit,
and therby made able to know what the
Scripture saith: wee know a man may
speake to his friend not only by word of
mouth but also by letter, and thereby
expresse his meaning sufficiently; euen
so, though God speake not now vnto his
Church by created voice, yet by his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
word he speakes sufficiently for the
cleare manifestation of his will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
concerning them; and therefore it
is a shamefull slander and blasphemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Scriptures to call them an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie
letter and dumbe iudge.</hi> And let them
shew, if the Scripture be not, where is
that speaking iudge who hath power iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall
to expound the scripture. Indeed
their answer is, that the Church is this
Iudge, and that we must consult at her
mouth for the true meaning of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
<hi>Answ.</hi> The church hath a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
and dispensation committed vnto
her, in the execution whereof she deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the meaning of the Scripture vnto
Gods people, but that is not from any
iudiciall authority committed vnto her,
to determine of the sense of Scripture of
her selfe; but onely by comparing scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
with scripture, and expounding
one place out of another; euen as the
Lawyer giues the sense of the law, not
from any iudicial power giuen vnto him
aboue the law, but by obseruing the
words with the scope and circumstances
of the law. But heere I would know, if
the Church must needs bee iudge, by
what meanes must she determine? They
answer, by the <hi>rule of faith;</hi> the <hi>consent of
Councels and Fathers;</hi> and if these faile,
then <hi>by the Pope; Answ.</hi> By their rule
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:16197:23"/>
of faith, they vnderstand, <hi>vnwritten tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,</hi>
that is, such truth beside Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as hath beene kept by tradition
from hand to hand since the primitiue
Church. But these are meere forgeries,
and shame it were to subiect the truth of
God to the deuice of man; if these bee
made iudge of Scripture, then shall the
faith of the church depend vpon the
<hi>wisedome of man,</hi> and not vpon the <hi>power
of God,</hi> a thing abhorred of the Apostle
1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 5. The onely rule of faith is
the Scripture, and true faith will admit
no other iudge beside the Scripture to
determine of that whereon it must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.
Secondly, for their consent of
Fathers and Councels, that is no suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
meanes to determine of the true
sense of Scripture; for their seuerall er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
and contradictions one to another,
&amp; many times to themselues, shew, that
they wanted the immediate assistance of
the Spirit. And the same is true of the
Pope, as might easily be proued at large,
by their grosse ignorance &amp; errors. And
therfore it remaines that the true iudge
and expounder of Scripture, is Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it selfe, as Christ himselfe by his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
sheweth in this place.</p>
            <p>The place alledged by Christ, is this
commandement of God vnto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">Deut. 6. 16.</note>
               <hi>Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy
God.</hi> For the vnderstanding whereof we
must search out three things, first what
the <hi>tempting of God</hi> signifieth: secondly,
the <hi>manner</hi> how God is tempted: and
thirdly,<note place="margin">To tempt God.</note> the <hi>cause and root</hi> thereof. For
the first, to tempt God signifieth, to
make triall and experience of God, and
to prooue whether hee be so true, iust,
mercifull, prouident and powerfull as
his word reporteth him to be. Thus did
the Israelites often tempt God, as the
Lord saith,<note n="a" place="margin">Psalm. 95. 9.</note> 
               <hi>When your fathers tempted
me, proued me, and saw my workes;</hi> which
latter words shew what it is to tempt
God, euen to seeke to haue proofe by
his works whether he be such a one as his
word saith he is. If any shall say we are
commanded, <hi>to taste and see how gratious
the Lord is, Ps.</hi> 34. 8. yea the Lord bids
his people <hi>proue him, Malach.</hi> 3. 10.
<hi>Answ.</hi> Those places do sufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
themselues, for Dauids taste and
sight is by the grace of true faith and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance,
for in the same verse he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
such blessed; and in Malachie the
Lord bids them prooue him, but yet in
their way of obedience in prouiding for
his Sanctuary according to his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.
Therefore we must know for the
second point, that euery triall of God is
not simply euill, but that which is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
when without warrant from his
word we presume vpon him beyond the
meanes of his ordinary prouidence.
Thirdly, the root of this sinne, is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuing
heart, whereby a man doubts
of the truth of Gods word, of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
presence and prouidence. <hi>Ps.</hi> 78.
18. <hi>The Israelites tempted God in their
hearts;</hi> there is this sinne: the maner how
followeth, <hi>in requiring meat for their lusts
&amp;c.</hi> not contenting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues with Gods
present prouidence; the root &amp; ground
whereof is set downe, <hi>vers. 22. because
they beleeued not in God and trusted not in
his helpe.</hi> When a man doubts of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
of his seruant he wil lay something
in his way, as a peece of siluer, his purse
&amp;c. to trie him withall; so when a man
begins to doubt of Gods goodnesse and
fidelity towards him, hee will easily be
brought to make needlesse triall of him
by some worke of God beside his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
prouidence. The meaning then is
this, <hi>Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy
God,</hi> that is, thou shalt not make any
needlesse triall of Gods goodnesse, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
power or prouidence, from a distrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
heart in the truth of his word.</p>
            <p>Heere yet further for our instruction
wee are to know that God is tempted
fiue waies, as the word of God doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest:<note place="margin">God is tempted fiue waies.</note>
first, when a man shall appoint
vnto God, either the <hi>time</hi> when, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>place</hi> where, or the <hi>maner</hi> how God shall
helpe him, and performe his word vnto
him; heerein he seeks experience of the
truth and power of God. Thus the Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites
tempted God in the wildernesse
when they wanted water; saying,<note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 17. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Is
God among vs or no?</hi> God had promised
to bee with them in all their iourney to
Canaan, but that they will not now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
vnlesse he wil shew his presence by
giuing them water in that place. And so
likewise they tempted him in the want
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:16197:24"/>
of foood, <hi>Ps. 78. 19. Can God prepare a
table in the wildernesse.</hi> The considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whereof must teach vs in all our pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
which we make vnto God for the
accomplishment of his promises vnto
vs, to beware of<note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 78. 41.</note> 
               <hi>limiting God,</hi> as the
Iewes did, by prescribing vnto him time,
place &amp; maner for the accomplishment
thereof; but wait with patience his good
leasure. For hee that beleeueth will not
make haste, but wil <hi>commit his way to the
Lord: Ps.</hi> 37. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, God is tempted when men
require a signe at his hands. Thus the
Pharisies tempted Christ: Matt. 12. 38.
<hi>Master we would see a signe of thee:</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
thereby to be certified whether hee
were the Messias, and Luke saith, <hi>they
tempted him, Luk.</hi> 11. 16. And thus doe
all those tempt God, which refuse to
embrace the doctrine of the Gospel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they cannot see the ministers ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to confirme the same by miracles.
Thus do many Papists plead against our
religion, embracing rather the mysterie
of iniquity, because: it is confirmed vnto
them by lying wonders; not considering
that the truth which wee professe was
once sufficiently confirmed to bee the
truth of God, by his owne testimony
thereunto in signes &amp; wonders through
the hands of his Apostles. <hi>Quest.</hi> Is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
asking of a signe a tempting of
God? for <hi>Gedion</hi> asked a signe when he
was to be a Iudge and deliuerer of gods
people, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 6. 17. And so did <hi>Hezekiah</hi>
to bee assured of the lengthning of his
daies, 2. King. 20. 8. And yet we reade
not that God charged them with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pring
him, but did condescend to their
requests. <hi>Answ.</hi> There be two causes in
which we may require a signe of God &amp;
not tempt him: first, when God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
a man to ask a signe at his hands:
so might Azah haue asked a signe of
God, for his assurance of victorie accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Gods promise, yea he is<note n="c" place="margin">Isai. 7. 11. 12. 13.</note> bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
for not asking it when the Lord
commanded him. Secondly, a man may
aske a signe of God, when it serueth for
the necessary confirmation of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
calling, or of some special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of God made to man: in this case
did Gedion aske a signe of God for the
further confirmation of his extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
calling to bee a Deliuerer vnto Gods
people. And so did Hezekiah for his
further assurance in the lengthning of
his life, by an extraordinary promise,
fifteene yeares. But out of these cases to
aske a signe of God is to tempt him; as
the Pharisies did, who would prescribe
vnto God what kinde of miracle they
would haue, euen a signe from heauen,
not contenting themselues with those
miracles which Christ did ordinarilie
worke among them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, a man tempts God, when he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
goes on in any sinne against Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
for hereby he makes need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
triall of Gods iustice, mercy, and
patience. The Lord saith of his people,
<hi>they</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Num. 14. 22.</note> 
               <hi>tempted him ten times, and haue not
obeied his voice:</hi> Mal. 3. 15. <hi>The people
murmuringly say, they that worke wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
are set vp, and they that tempt God are
deliuered;</hi> where working wickednesse
and tempting of God are al one. Which
serues to admonish vs, that with al speed
we break off the course of our sins by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
for while we continue in sinne
we tempt God, and so lie open to all his
iudgements, depriuing our selues of the
guard and protection of Gods holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
nay they will become our enemies,
and insteed of protection, execute gods
heauy vengeance vpon vs.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, they tempt God, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
vpon Gods people, there ligious
obseruation of legall ceremonies aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
by Christ: <hi>Act. 15. 10. Why tempt
ye God (saith Peter) to lay a yoake on the
Disciples neckes, which neither our Fathers
nor we were able to beare?</hi> This is to make
triall of Gods power in the sauing of his
people. Whereby we may see how wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and damnable the Romish religion
is, which wholly stands in the obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ceremonies, partly heathenish, and
partly Iudaical, whereto when men sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
themselues, they do nothing else but
tempt God.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, they tempt God, that refuse or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
neglect the ordinarie and necessarie
meanes of their preseruation, either for
body or soule: as hee that being to goe
ouer a water, will leaue the bridge
which is the ordinarie way, and aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:16197:24"/>
dangerously through the water:
for heerein he seekes a needlesse experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Gods power: so doe they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
that neglect or contemne Gods
holy ordinance for the sauing of mens
soules in the ministery of the word. Now
to this kinde of tempting God doth
Christ apply this commandement in
this place; as if he should say, when God
hath affoorded vnto men an ordinarie
meanes for their helpe and safety, they
are not to refuse the same, and seeke for
safety from God extraordinarily. I am
now in a dangerous place I confesse, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this pinnacle, yet there is some ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
way to get down as staires or lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
and therefore vnlesse I would <hi>tempt
the Lord my God,</hi> I may not cast my selfe
downe and thereby seeke for extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
preseruaiton, as thou perswadest
me. Thus also they sinne that goe into
places of great danger without a calling:
so Peter sinned in thrusting himselfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Caiphas hal, a place of temptation, as
by lamentable experience he found too
true. Thus <hi>Dauids three Worthies</hi> sinned
in aduenturing vpon their enemies host,
for the fetching of a little water out of
the well of Bethlehem; &amp; therfore when
it was brought vnto him, <hi>Dauid would not
drinke thereof, but powred it out for a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
vnto the Lord, 2. Sam.</hi> 23. 16.</p>
            <p>Heere some may aske, whether they
do not tempt God, that aduenture to
clime on high places, to stand on spire
steeples, to runne on the ridge of high
houses, and to goe on ropes a great
height from the ground. <hi>Answ.</hi> Men
may doe such things in a twofold estate,
either hauing a lawfull calling thereto,
as Carpenters and Masons, who are to
worke vpon high buildings; now they
without tempting of God may clime
and stand on high and dangerous pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
or else hauing no lawfull calling
thereto, as they who vse to doe such
things to make knowen their actiuity, or
only to affoord delight and admiration
vnto others for their priuate gaine and
aduantage; and such tempt God feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully;
for Christ was better able to haue
cast himselfe downe from this pinnacle,
and haue preserued himselfe without
hurt, then these men are to saue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
in their aduentures, and yet hee
refused so to do, because hee would not
tempt the Lord his God. Thus much
for the meaning of this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The doctrine for instruction hence,
is to be gathered from this command
applied to the text which the Diuell al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth;
and it is this: <hi>whosoeuer looketh
for the accomplishment of Gods promises vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, must be carefull to walke before God
in the waies of his commandements, and in
the workes of his calling with all good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</hi>
God indeed hath made many
gratious promises in his word, of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
temporall and eternall, but they
that tempt God shall not find the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of them; mens sinnes hinder these
things from them; Gods goodnesse is
to bee seene and tasted in the waies of
faith and obedience. God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the guard of his Angels to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
while they keep themselues in their
waies: if therefore thou wouldest haue
this protection thou must keep thy selfe
in those waies that God would haue
thee to walke in. Also in theri hesse of
his loue God hath made a promise of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting
life with freedome from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
perdition, to those that beleeue in
Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 16. Thou therefore that
wouldest enioy the comfort of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to thine immortality and life, must
get true faith into thy heart and thereby
liue all the daies of thy life. The same
may bee said of euery promise of God
pertaining either to soule or body, the
fruition of them doth depend vpon the
practise of some part of obedience;
which if thou doest neglect thou doest
but presume in making title to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise:
<hi>Peter tels Symon Magus</hi> plainely,
<hi>he had no part with them in the gifts of the
spirit,</hi> while his heart retained a purpose
to liue in sinne, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 21. Breake off
therefore the course of sinne, and inure
thy selfe to the practise of obedience, so
shall Gods promises be sweet vnto thine
heart; and the more thou proceedest in
obedience, the more comfort thou shalt
find in Gods gratious promises: but if
thou doe lay hold on sinne, the comfort
of the word will depart from thee. And
thus much for the second temptation.</p>

               <p>Againe the Diuell tooke him
vp into an exceeding high mountaine,
and shewed him all the kingdomes of the
world, and the glory of them;</p>
               <p>9. And said vnto him, all these will I giue

            </q>
            <p>THese words containe the third con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
betweene our Sauiour Christ
and Satan; wherin consider three points;
I. Satans preparation: v. 8. II. Satans
assault vpon Christ: v. 9. III. Christs
answer thereto: v. 10. For the first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee come to the handling of it in
particular, wee are to consider that vnto
euery assault the Diuell prepares himself
afresh: which should teach vs to labour
to furnish our hearts euery day afresh to
be able to repulse his new assaults. Now
particularly; this preparation hath two
parts: first, <hi>Satan takes Christ into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
high mountaine:</hi> secondly, <hi>he shews
him all the kingdomes of the world and the
glory of them all.</hi> For the first, it may bee
demanded what way Satan tooke vp
Christ into this <hi>high mountaine? Answ.</hi>
He might do it two waies; either by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
or by reall and locall transportation
of his body from the temple to some
high mountaine. Some thinke this was
done by vision only in Christs mind, as
<note n="a" place="margin">Ezek. 40. 2.</note>
               <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was caried by the Lord from
Babylon to an exceeding high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
in the land of Israel. But I rather
thinke that Christ was really and locally
transported by the Diuell in body from
the temple to some high mountaine; for
Christs temptations were not imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but true and reall. Againe, the words
import a true and reall transportation
without any mention of a vision.</p>
            <p>The reasons why the Diuell carries
Christ to an high mountaine may bee
these: first, the Diuel hath a great desire
to imitate God in his glorious workes,
that so hee may disgrace the workes of
God, yea and God himselfe as much as
he can. Now we read<note n="b" place="margin">Deut. 34. 1. 2. &amp;c.</note> that God tooke
vp Moses into mount Nebo, from
whence hee shewed him all the land of
Canaan; so Satan, that he might seeme to
go beyond God, takes vp Christ into
an exceeding high mountaine to shew
him all the kingdomes of the world and
the glory of them. Secondly, he did it
for the furtherance of this last assault
wherewith hee tempted Christ, for hee
meant to entice Christ with the glory of
the world, and therefore brings him
where hee might take the fairest view
thereof.</p>
            <p>Now in that Satan transports the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of our Sauiour Christ this second
time,<note place="margin">Satan may haue power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the bodies of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> wee see that by Gods permission,
Satan may haue power ouer the bodies
of Gods children, to transport the same
from place to place, or otherwise to vex
them, and that not once onely, but sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
times. This we must obserue, and
remember carefully as a stay and prop a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
distrust &amp; despaire, if God should
suffer Satan to vex vs, by such transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of our bodies from place to place,
or by any outward calamity; &amp; that not
once or twise but diuers times; for that
which befell the head Christ Iesus, may
well befall any of his members.</p>
            <p>The second part of the Diuels prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is this: <hi>he shewes vnto Christ all the
kingdoms of the world, &amp; the glory of them.</hi>
This he could not do actually, for there
is no mountaine so high in all the world,
whereon if a man were placed, he could
see one halfe or one quarter of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of the world, as they are seated
and placed vpon the face of the earth;
nay if a man were set in the sunne, and
from thence could looke vnto the earth,
yet hee could not see past the halfe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
And therefore wee must know that
the Diuel did this in a counterfet vision,
for heerein hee can frame an imitation
of God.</p>
            <p>Now the Diuels visions bee of two
sorts;<note place="margin">Of Diabolicall visious.</note> either in the outward senses, or in
the mind and vnderstanding. His visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the outward senses be delusions,
whereby he makes men be leeue they see
that, which indeed they do not see; this
might easily be proued by manifold ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
recorded in the histories of all
times, but that one shall suffice, of his
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:16197:25"/>
counterfait resemblance of<note n="a" place="margin">Sam. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Samuels</hi>
forme and attire to the witch of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
for the deluding of Saul; when as
indeed Samuels true body was in the
graue, and his soule with the Lord.</p>
            <p>Secondly the diue hath visions wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bv
he deludes the vnderstanding. Zak.
13. 4. The Lord saith heereof, <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
shalbe ashamed euery one of his vision.</hi>
These visions the Diuell shewes to men
sometime sleeping, and sometime wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king;
euen as the Lord doth shew his
visions to his owne seruants. The visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Satan shewed to men sleeping are
called <hi>dreames; Deut. 13. 1. the false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
hath his dreame.</hi> His visions shewed
to men waking, are to such as haue cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
brame, whom he perswades strange
things of themselues, as some, that they
are kings or princes; others, that they are
Christ, Iohn Baptist, &amp; such like; exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
heereof in all ages are many. Now
touching this vision of Satan to Christ;
some thinke it was inward in Christs
minde; but I rather take it to haue beene
in his outward senses only, as the words
of the text do import; the Diuell by his
art did cunningly set forth and represent
vnto the eies of Christ a notable shew
and representation of all the kingdomes
of the earth, and the glory of them.</p>
            <p>Heerein the Diuell sheweth great
power and skill in that he can represent
vnto the eie in his counterfet visions
such strange and admirable sights. And
it teacheth vs, that the practises of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers
and magicians, vndertaking to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
vnto the eie, partly in the aire,
and partly in glasses, either the persons
of men that liued long since, or actions
done in farre countries, or long before,
are not meere fancies as some thinke,
who deny altogether that such things
can be shewed: for the Diuell can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
things done long since and a far
off; for if he could set such a sight before
the eie of our Sauiour Christ in vision,
as the view of the whole world, and the
glory thereof, then much more can he
represent vnto the eie of man strange
and maruellous things.</p>
            <p>The Diuels drift in this resemblance
vnto Christ is this; heereby he intended
most cunningly to insinuat himselfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the heart of our Sauior Christ: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he propounds this third assault, hee
shews vnto Christ all the kingdomes of
the world and the glorie of them, that
Christ might take a liking of them, and
so desire them, and at length accept of
them vpon Satans offer. Thus he dealt
with our first parents;<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 3. 6.</note> vpon their first
communication he shewes vnto Eue the
outward beauty of the forbidden fruit,
<hi>that it was faire to locke vpon,</hi> and tels her
of the good estate they should attain vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
by eating of it, and so at length brings
her to yeeld to his temptation.</p>
            <p>Hence we must learne to haue speciall<note place="margin">Looke well to seeing and hearing.</note>
care in the good ordering of all the
outward senses of our bodies, specially
the two senses of learning, <hi>seeing and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;</hi>
for by them the Diuell can cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
conuey his temptations into our
hearts: the senses (specially these two)
are the windowes of the heart and soule,
and if we keepe them not well, Satan will
be sure to conuay some euill into vs. We
must therefore obey Salomons counsell,
<note n="b" place="margin">Prou. 4. 23.</note>
               <hi>keepe thy heart aboue all watch and ward;</hi>
this we cannot do, vnlesse we looke well
to our outward senses, for they are the
doores of the heart. This made Dauid
to pray,<note n="c" place="margin">Psa. 119. 37.</note> 
               <hi>Lord turne away mine eies from
beholding vanity:</hi> and Iob<note n="d" place="margin">Iob. 31. 1.</note> to make a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant
with his eies. And so must wee
make conscience of hearing and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
lest thereby wee giue aduantage to
the Tempter.</p>
            <p>Further, in this sight obserue the deep
policy of the Diuell; there are in the
kingdomes of the world besides glory
and dignity, many troubles, hurliburlies
and vexations; now these the Diuell
conceales from Christ, and shewes him
only the glory, pompe, wealth and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the world, that so hee might the
more easily winde his temptation into
the heart of our Sauiour Christ. And
this same course he stil obserueth in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting
men to sinne; he hides from their
eies all the miseries, plagues and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which are due to sin and that will
follow vpon it; and shewes them onely
all the profits and delights that they may
reape thereby: thus hee sugars ouer the
poison of his temptations, that men ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
feele the bitternesse of them till their
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:16197:26"/>
soules be thereby deadly infected: but
then he takes a cleane contrary course,
and shewes to the wounded soule all the
woes and terrours of Gods wrath, that if
it be possible he may bring a man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire.
And therefore we must be most
watchfull of being insnated with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulnesse
of sinne in the false shew of
profit and pleasure.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the diuels policy doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
appeare in reseruing this temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the last place; for he knowes full
well how forcible with man be the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
of profits,<note place="margin">Temptations from the right hand most dangerous.</note>
pleasures &amp; honors.
From whence we may also learne, that
temptations fetched on the right hand
from honour, pleasure and commodity,
are the most dangerous and doe soonest
creepe into the heart of man, preuailing
far more then temptations on the left
hand, which are taken from aduersity.
The Diuell foiled<note n="a" place="margin">2. Sam. 11. 2.</note> Dauid worse in the
time of peace &amp; ease, then euer he could
do during the time of Sauls grieuous
persecution against him. And he preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
more against the Church by errours
and heresies vnder Constantine and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
christian Emperours, then he could
do by most bloudy persecution for the
space of three hundred years before. Yea
in these our daies wordly hopes haue
drawn those from the syncerity of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whom outward violence could not
moue: prosperity is a slippery path
wherein a man doth soone catch a fall,
and therefore we must learne to be most
watchfull ouer our owne harts when we
haue fairest weather with the world.</p>
            <p>Lastly, S. Luke<note n="b" place="margin">Luk 45.</note> addeth this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of time, that the Diuell shewed all
these things vnto Christ in as short a
time as might be, euen in a <hi>moment or
point of time:</hi> whereby we may perceiue
the Diuels great celerity &amp; speed in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing he takes in hand, herein he
goes beyond all men in the world: for
being a spirit hee is able to worke won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and though he cannot go beyond
the strength and compasse of nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his power is finite, yet by reason of
his agility and speed he can goe beyond
the ordinary course of nature in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of working the things hee takes in
hand. And this exceeding quicke speed
the Diuell heere vseth, to stirre vp in
Christ a more eager desire after those
strange &amp; goodly things wherof he had
but as it were a glimple, that so by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
he might worke in Christ a liking
of them; for the nature of man doth
more eagerly affect strange things when
they be sudden, and the eie of man doth
more wistly behold them. And this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
as the former, must make vs watchful
against all Satans crafty wiles, that wee
be not beguised by him. Thus much
for Satans preparation.</p>
            <p>The second point in this conflict, is
the temptation it selfe, in these words;
vers. 9. <hi>And said vnto him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Satan <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> bring <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to idolatry.</note>
               <hi>all these will I
giue thee, if thou wilt fall downe and worship
me.</hi> The drift of Satan in this assault
(which we must carefully obserue) is to
draw Christ to commit idolatry by the
hope of wordly kingdomes and the
glory of them: heerwith he proues him
when he could neither weaken his faith
by his first temptation, nor worke pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
in him by his second. And
looke how he dealeth heere with Christ,
so doth he commonly in the world; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a ones conscience and religion doth
he quite ouerthrow by wordly hopes of
riches, pleasures and preserments: heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
not only ordinary professours, but
ministers and preachers of the Gospell
haue beene drawen to absure and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
that truth which formerlie they
haue taught, and to betake themselues as
the Popes vassals to professe and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his blasphemous idolatries: heerby
also Protestant merchants, are drawen
to become very seruiceable to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Churches, by transporting among
them wax and such like merchandize,
which serue as necessary helps &amp; furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
to their idolatrous seruice. And
what else is it that makes the people ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
to change religion with the times
and states, but because they would still
enioy their wordly commodities? And
the more men doe possesse in the world,
ordinarily the lesse courage and resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they haue for the religion of God, as
experience in Queen Maries daies hath
shewed; which in generall may admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
vs how dangerous an enemy the
world is to the power of true religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:16197:26"/>
This temptation hath two parts: A
promise made to Christ; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
thereof. The promise in these
words, <hi>All these will I giue thee:</hi> he saith
not, I will procure God to giue them
vnto thee, but <hi>I will giue thee them:</hi> where
we may see, that Satans drift is to cause
Christ to take him for his Lord, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
and wait on him for his kingdom,
and to acknowledge him to be the giuer
thereof: which notably bewraies his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregious
boldnesse, that dares thus chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
to himselfe the Lords owne right,
euen in the presence of him who was
true Lord &amp; King of heauen and earth.
Let no man therefore thinke, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
will lose ought for want of aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
but in regard thereof be better ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
against him.</p>
            <p>Now that which the Diuell aimed at
in Christ doth hee commonly effect in
the world, he makes men beleeue that
he is the giuer of all things and so brings
many a one to relie vpon him. Indeed
with their lips men wil confesse that God
giues them their daily bread, euen all
things they haue; but their dealings
and practises speake aloud that the diuel
is gouerner and giuer of all; for how do
many men get their liuings? Is it not by
lying, fraud, and oppressio? Doe not
most men heereby seeke to inrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues?
Wel, the iust Lord neuer appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
such meanes: the diuel setteth such
courses a flote, and him they serue, and
on him they rely that walke therein.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Satan enmity against Christs spirituall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note>
note a further reach of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
in this promise of these earthly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
euen to ouerthrow Christs spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
kingdome. Satan knew well that if
Christ were the true Messias he should
be a King, and haue a kingdome, though
not earthly, yet spirituall in the hearts
and consciences of men, which should
be the ruine of his kingdome; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he labours with Christ to entertaine
an earthly kingdome, that so his spiritual
kingdome might not be looked after.
And looke as hee seekes to deale with
Christ the head, so he perseueres against
the church which is his body; for Gods
Church hath it ministery, which in it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is a soueraigntie, to be exercised in
the dispensation of the word: now the
Diuell hath laboured by all meanes to
bring this ministerie wherein the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
spirituall soueraignty doth consist,
to become an earthly lordship and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
that by this meanes he might
ouerturne it, and make it fruitlesse in the
building and vpholding of Christs spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
kingdome: and how he hath preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
this way the Church of Rome doth
shew to all the world.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, obserue the largenesse of the
Diuels promise: <hi>he will giue to Christ, all
the kingdomes of the world and the glorie of
them:</hi> but this is more then he meant to
our Sauiour Christ, at leastwise more
then he could perform, for all these were
not in his power. Now because in all
things we must be as vnlike the Diuell as
may be, hence we must learn to be wary
and watchful to our promises, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we be not like vnto Satan, promising
that which we neuer meane to performe,
or neuer can performe though we meant
it. In all our promises therefore we must
looke to two things; First, whether the
thing we promise be in our power; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
whether it be lawfull and meet
for vs to performe: And thus making
promises we must endeuour alwayes to
make good the same. This fidelitie in
keeping promise is a fruit of the spirit,
called by the Apostle, <hi>faith, Gal.</hi> 5. 25.
and a propertie of him that must <hi>rest in
Gods holy mountaine, Psal.</hi> 15. 4. not to
change from a mans lawfull oath or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
though the performance of it tend
to his great hinderance.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, in this promise of Satan we
may obserue, that hee knowes all the
kingdomes of the world, else he could
not haue shewed them to him which
heere he offers to giue: yea his offering
of them, with the glory of them al, which
hee could so speedily represent, doth
shew vnto vs that hee is most expert in
the policies and regiments of states and
kingdomes; hee goes not to and fro for
nought compassing the earth, Iob. 1. 7.
And his promise of them to Christ, was
made to inflame his heart with ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
after those kingdomes and glories,
that he might enioy some of them at the
least. Wherein we may note that one
speciall practise of the Diuell is to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:16197:27"/>
states and kingdomes, by putting
ambition into mens hearts after earthly
kingdomes, and glories: his study is to
do mischiefe, and in the ruine of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
he ouerthrowes many, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
heereunto hee endeuours himselfe
with might and maine. Hence come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrections
&amp; rebellions in kingdomes,
which no time nor age could euer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape:
looke as he stirred vp the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans
and Sabeans to inrich themselues
by the spoiling of Iob, so dealeth he by
ambitious and couetous persons in all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
as true records of times do fully
testifie. We may see the truth heereof in
our own land, in the manifold complots
and treasons both at home and abroad
that haue been conspired and attempted
against our<note n="*" place="margin">Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth and it may fitly be applied to our present State.</note> Prince and State, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
men stirred vp by the diuell through
ambition &amp; discontent: howsoeuer by
Gods mercy themselues haue beene ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the snare that they laid for others.
In regard whereof we are all bound to
yeeld all praise and glory to God for his
gratious preseruation and defence both
of our prince &amp; state; and to shew forth
our thankfulnesse by all holy obedience
vnto that God who hath brought to
nought the diuelish conspiracies &amp; trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries
of the ambitious instruments of
Satan. Secondly, we must pray vnto God
continually for the preseruation of our
Prince &amp; State; crying aloud vnto God
as the people did at the coronation<note n="a" place="margin">1. King. 1. 39.</note> of
<hi>Salomon,</hi> for the safety of our Prince: yea
we must daily intreat the Lord to bring
to nought the counsell of Achitophels,
&amp; of all that think euil against the Lords
anointed among vs. <hi>Quest.</hi> But how
comes it to passe that any Prince or State
can stand, if the Diuell haue such malice
against them? <hi>Answ.</hi> Through the good
prouidence of God, who giues his good
Angels charge to guard and defend, not
only his children in particular, but also
whole Kingdoms and States. And one
part of their office is for the good of
Gods Church to repell the rage of Satan
and his instruments, yea to stand with
Gods church in the execution of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
vpon the enemies thereof. In the
siege of Iericho an heauenly<note n="b" place="margin">Iosh. 5. 14.</note> captaine of
the Lord of hosts came to helpe Ioshu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah:
and when the king of Syria sent a
mighty host to take the Prophet Elisha
that was in Dothan, the Lord sent for
his defence<note n="c" place="margin">2. King. 6. 17.</note> 
               <hi>horses &amp; chariots of fire which
filled the mountaines.</hi> And in the dayes of
Hezekia, for his comfort, and the ioy of
Gods people, an Angel of the Lord slew
in the host of Zenacherib, that came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Ierusalem,<note place="margin">Isai. 37. 36.</note>
               <hi>an hundred fourescore
and fiue thousand in one night.</hi> And wee
want not sure testimonie of this good
prouidence of God, in the strange disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueries
of many diuelish conspiracies.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Satan saith, <hi>all these will I giue
thee.</hi> This is the voice of the great red
Dragon: and the same is the voice of
the Pope of Rome, both registred in
their canons and daily attempted in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,
to dispose of all the kingdomes of
the earth; whereby he shewes euidently,
that he is that<note n="d" place="margin">Reu. 13. 11.</note> 
               <hi>beast comming out of the
earth hauing two hornes like the Lambe,
but he spake like the Dragon.</hi> For the
Lambs hornes he shewes in calling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
the seruant of sernants; and the
voice of the Dragon, that is, of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel,
in taking vpon him to dispose of the
soueraignties of these earthly kingdoms.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Saint Luke recordeth a reason,
which the Diuell addeth to his promise,
to preuent all conceit of impossibility
in him to performe the same; to wit, for
that<note n="e" place="margin">Luk. 4. 6.</note> 
               <hi>the power and glory of all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of the world is deliuered to him, and
to whomsoeuer he will be giues it.</hi> Wherein
obserue in Satan two notorious sinnes:
first, a grosse lie; for Daniel saith,<note n="f" place="margin">Dan. 4. 22.</note> that
it is <hi>Iehouah, the most high God, who bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
rule ouer all the kingdomes of men, and
giueth them to whomsoeuer he wil.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
arrogant and shamelesse boasting, to
vaunt himselfe euen to the Lords owne
face, as though he were soueraigne lord
of that which belongs to God alone.
The consideration whereof must moue
vs, who in all godlie conuersation must
be contrary to Satan, to renounce all ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and to make conscience to speake
the truth from our hearts. And also to
abandon all vaine boasting of our selues
what we are, or what we can do, yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to speake basely of our selues that so
God in all good things we do may haue
the glory. Lying and bragging are the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:16197:27"/>
properties of Satan, and therefore can
not beseeme the tongue and heart of the
children of God.</p>
            <p>The second point in this temptation,
is the hard condition which satan would
haue Christ to yeeld vnto for this gift;
<hi>If thou wilt fall down &amp; worship me:</hi> euen
to commit most abominable idolatrie
in worshipping the Diuell himselfe.
Heerein we may obserue sundrie things:</p>
            <p>First, that it is a principall part of the
Diuels endeuours against Gods church,
to seeke the ouerthrow of true religion,
and the pure worship of God, by sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therein the seeds of heresies and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries;
for if he dares be thus bold with
Christ the head, as to seeke to draw him
from the worship of his Father to such
abominable idolatrie, what will he not
attempt with silly and sinfull men? The
Scriptures are plentifull in shewing his
indeuours this way. <hi>Michaiah saw in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">1. Kin. 22. 22.</note>
               <hi>an euill spirit</hi> offering himselfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, to become a lying spirit in the
mouth of <hi>all Ahabs prophets,</hi> euen foure
hundred at one time. When Iehoshuah
<note n="b" place="margin">Zak. 3. 1.</note>the high Priest stood before the Lord,
<hi>Satan stood at his right hand to resist him,</hi>
hee sought to hinder the building and
worship of the materiall temple; much
more therefore will he seeke to hinder
the building of the spirituall temple,
euen the worke of the ministery in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion
of soules whereby they are pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
out of Satans kingdome, and made
pillars in the temple of the liuing God.
Satan is that<note n="c" place="margin">Matth. 13. 39.</note> 
               <hi>enuious man that soweth
tares</hi> of errors and heresies in the church
of God which is the <hi>field</hi> of the good
husbandman. He hindred<note n="d" place="margin">1. Thes. 2. 18.</note> Paul from
comming to the Thessalonians, whereby
it appeares, that he did his endeuour to
hinder the course of the Apostolicall
ministery. In the church of Smyrna,<note n="e" place="margin">Reu. 2. 10.</note> 
               <hi>he
cast some into prison,</hi> stirring vp wicked
men so to do, thereby to hinder the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
of the Gospell.<note n="e" place="margin">Reu. 16. 13. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Iohn saw three
vncleane spirits like frogges come out of the
mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth
of the beast, and out of the mouth of the
false Prophet.</hi> These are <hi>spirits of Diuels,
working miracles, and going to the kings
of the earth:</hi> thither they go for the stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page
of the Gospell; for if kings oppose
themselues they become greatest hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
to the Gospell of all other. And
these frogges, by the common consent
of Catholike expositors, are the rabble
of Popish Friers, Priests, and Iesuites,
who seeke the infection of States tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
all the world. By all which, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels
enmitie against the Church is most
apparent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The vse.</hi> I. This shewes what care
and diligence Gods Ministers should
shew for the building of Gods Church
and the furtherance of the Gospell: for
they should seeke to the vttermost of
their power to counteruaile the enuious
practise of satan against the Church.</p>
            <p>II. Euery Christian must hence
learne, to pray not only for their owne
good estate, but also for the welfare of
Gods Church euery where, in the free
passage of the Gospell, in the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of true doctrine, and in the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of constant obedience therunto.
For Satans endeuour is to subuert and
corrupt the truth, and to draw men
from obedience; and vnto him Gods
children must euer oppose themselues,
the rather because their welfare stands
in the good of Gods Church.</p>
            <p>Secondlie, in this condition of Satans
offer to Christ wee may obserue that his
endeuour is to bring men to worship
him: for if he durst attempt a demaund
heerof at the hands of Christ, who shall
thinke to escape this assault when opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
serues him? And howsoeuer men
thinke it impossible, that Satan should
thus far preuaile with any, as to bring
them to worship him; yet doubtlesse
(though hee could not preuaile with
Christ) heerein hee attaines his purpose
in the world, and that with the greatest
part thereof: for the three religions of
the Iew, Turke, and Papist, doe at this
day ouerspread the greatest part of the
face of the earth; and in them all, such
a worship of God is propounded vnto
men,<note place="margin">Two rules for triall of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> wherein God is not worshipped
but the Diuell. For the euidence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
marke these two rules; First, <hi>that all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
doctrines denised by man in the matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which either directly or by iust conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
oppugne the word of God, are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of Diuels: 1. Tim.</hi> 4. 1. 3. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:16197:28"/>
repugnant to the word, touching
mariage, and meares, are doctrines of
Diuels; and so by proportion are all
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> such like. Secondly, <hi>all deuised worship of
God by man, against Gods word, is no wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, but of the Diuell:</hi> 1. Cor. 10.
20. <hi>The things which the Gentiles sacrifice,
they sacrifice vnto Diuels and not vnto God.</hi>
Doubtlesse, the Gentiles intended to
worship God in their images, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that worship was not according to
Gods wil, the Apostle respects not their
intent, as a thing that could nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
in this case, but saith peremptorily,
their worship was done vnto the Diuell.
And in reason it must bee so, for why
should wee thinke, that God should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
that for his worship which is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to his will, but denised by man
according to the will of the Diuel?</p>
            <p>From these two rules it will follow,
that the best of the three forenamed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions,
is no worship of God, but of the
Diuell: for all of them haue such wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
as is deuised by man, &amp; not of God;
The Iew worships God out of Christ;
and so doth the Turke: yea and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
worship God, but yet out of the
true Christ; for (as hath beene shewed
elsewhere) the Christ of the Papists is a
counterfet Christ. And in many other
points of their religion, there is apparent
repugnancy to the word of God: yea of
their <hi>sacrifice of the Masse,</hi> wee may as
truly say as the Apostle did of heathen
idol worship, that they sacrifice not vnto
God, but to the Diuell; for therein is
as vile, accursed and abominable idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
as euer was deuised by man. So that
it is plaine the Diuel doth mightily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
in causing men to worship him.
Yea hee preuaileth thus not onely in the
world, but in Gods Church; for all such
as (notwithstanding their outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession)
haue their hearts set vpon the
world, more eagerly affecting the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
profits and pleasures thereof then
God and his word, do in deed and truth
worship the Diuell; for hee is <hi>the</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 4.</note> 
               <hi>God
of this world,</hi> ruling in the heart of the
children of disobedience, by the baites
of honour, profit and pleasure he steales
mens hearts from God, and so heerein
they doing the will of the Diuell, must
needs worship him; for looke <hi>whereon
a man seteth his heart, that hee maketh his
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, heere obserue that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
would faine make a couenant with
Christ; for worship at Christs hands, he
wil giue Christ the glory &amp; riches of the
world; heereto is nothing wanting but
Christs consent. Whereby we see that it
may bee true which sundrie times wee
heare of, and many histories do record,
to witte, that some persons doe make a
league with the Diuell,<note place="margin">Some make a league with the Diuell.</note> wherein the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
couenanteth to be seruiceable vnto
them in procuring them honour, riches,
pleasures, or great renowme for some
strange actiuities, wherto he will enable
them, vpon condition that they for their
parts giue vnto him, their bodies, their
soules, or their bloud. Some indeed are
of mind, that such things are meere for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries
and delusions of the Diuell, and
that no league can bee made betweene
him and man; but they are deceiued,
for hee attempted in effect such a thing
with Christ, what will hee not therefore
do with silly and sinfull men, especially
when he finds them cast downe with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scontents?
And thus much for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels
assault.</p>
            <p>The third point in this conflict is
Christ answer. vers. 10. <hi>Then Iesus said
vnto him, Auoid Satan; for it is written,
thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and
him only shalt thou serue.</hi> This I will han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
as the words do lie in order.</p>
            <p>Before his answer hee propoundeth a
speech of indignation and detestation
both of the Diuell and his offer, <hi>auoid
Satan,</hi> as if he should say, I haue heard
thee Satan to speake imuriously against
my fathers word, and against my selfe;
and now againe, thou vtterest blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
against my father, wherein thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
about to dishonour him greatly; but
I abhorte thee Satan, and these thy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,
therfore hence, auoid, and
haue no more to do with me.</p>
            <p>In this detestation of Christ towards
Satan, for vttering blasphmie against
his father,<note place="margin">How to be have our selues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemers.</note> in his chalenge to haue power
to dispose of all the kingdomes of the
world as being his own; we are taught,
not onely to greeue at such blasphemies
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:16197:28"/>
as we shall heare vttered against God,
but to testifie our detestation and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
towards them. The world is full
of black mouthed Rabshekaes, who wil
not spare to blaspheme the glorious
name of our God, &amp; to scoffe &amp; deride
his sacred word: now whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we meet with
such, we must not be like Stoicks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
affection, but in Christian wisdome
from bleeding harts for the reproch of
God, shew forth godly zeale and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
for the rescue of his glorie. The
Hypocriticall practise of wicked Ieza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel<note n="a" place="margin">1. King. 21. 9. 10.</note>
in proclaming a fast vpon the false
accusation of Nabothes blasphemie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God and the king, may teach
Gods Church to be zealous indeed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>against
all blasphemers. When Rabihe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ka
railed on the God of Israel,<note n="b" place="margin">2. King. 19. 1.</note> good
king <hi>Hezekiahrent his clothes,</hi> and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
himselfe in great measure for that
reproch against his God. <hi>Teares</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Ps. 42. 3.</note> 
               <hi>were
Dauids meat day and night, while</hi> the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
among whom he was constrained
to liue, <hi>said vnto him where is thy God?
And iust Lot</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 8.</note> 
               <hi>vexed his righteous soule
from day to day with the vnlawfull deeds
of the filthie Sodomites, liuing among
them.</hi> The practise of these godly men
must be a president for vs to follow, that
we heare no blasphemie against God
without detestation. And as all Gods
children must practise this duty, so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
Masters of families: Dauid
<note n="e" place="margin">Ps. 101. 7.</note>would not suffer <hi>a lier</hi> or <hi>a slanderer to
come in his sight, or to abide in his house;</hi>
much lesse would he haue endured a
blasphemer of God, or a slanderer of
his word. The law commanded that
the<note n="f" place="margin">Leuit. 24. 14.</note> 
               <hi>blasphemer should he stoned to death,</hi>
who wittinglie and willingly spake a
word against God; and no doubt this
law is perpetuall. Let a man but speake a
word of disgrace against an earthlie
prince, and it costs him his life, and that
iustlie: how much more then should he
die the death though he had a thousand
liues, that shall blaspheme the king of
kings? Shal one that hath been baptized
into the name of Christ, say there is no
God, and that the Scriptures are but a
deuice of man, and yet liue? God forbid,
for this hellish sinne defiles a kingdome.
And therefore the Magistrate with the
sword of iustice must cry out against
such wretches, <hi>Away from vs blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, in this <hi>Auant</hi> of Christ gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to Satan, wee learne how to behaue
our selues against entisers from religion
and the obedience of God; wee must
hold them as limmes of the Diuell, and
in that regard haue nothing to do with
them, but with Christ bid them auoid
from vs. The<note n="g" place="margin">Deutr. 13. 6. 9.</note> Lord commanded that
in this case, <hi>Parents should not spare their
owne children; nor children spare their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
if they were enticers to idolatrie, but
their owne hands must be first vpon them to
put them to death:</hi> Our Sauiour Christ
would not spare Peter when he gaue him
bad counsell, to spare himselfe from suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
that which God hath ordained
for him, but saith vnto him,<note n="h" place="margin">Math. 16. 23.</note> 
               <hi>get behind
me Satan.</hi> So that we are without excuse
if we shal reiect this counsel of Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<note n="i" place="margin">Prou. 19. 27.</note>
               <hi>Heare no more the instruction, that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
to erre from the words of knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, heer by we also learne how
to behaue our selues towards satan when
he is violent and importunate in his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,
to wit, that howsoeuer we may
reply to them out of Gods word when
they are more milde, yet when Satan be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
therein to shew his force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
we must not reason with him; for
Christ would not endure his blasphemy,
though hee answered his temptations.
In schooles of learning it is counted a
simple part to hold alwaies to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion;
but in the schole of Christ when
the conscience is to deale with Satan, the
safest way is by both hands of faith to lay
fast hold of the conclusion; cleause fast to
Christ, let the Diuell say what he wil, be
not drawen thence one iot.</p>
            <p>After Christ hath shewed his dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
to Satans blasphemy he answers
his temptation; saying, <hi>It is written, thou
shalt worship the Lord thy God, &amp;c.</hi> And
whereas he saith the third time, <hi>it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi>
taking his answer from the Scripture;
it teacheth vs that Scripture of it selfe is
of power sufficient to vanquish the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell.
This the Church of Rome wil not
admit; for they make Scripture to bee
of two kinds; <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>outward;</hi> By
<hi>inward Scripture</hi> they meane, the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:16197:29"/>
consent of all Catholikes in all ages.
And by <hi>outward Scripture,</hi> they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the written word contained in the
Bible. Now they say, inward Scripture
is the more excellent; for the outward
Scripture they call <hi>a dead letter, of little or
no power;</hi> &amp; they make general councels
equall with them for substance of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
If this were true, Christ would
not haue alledged outward Scripture, as
they call it; but hee knew the written
word was the powerfull weapon, suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to vanquish the Diuell. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
heerein they doe shamefully bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spheme
the truth of God, and so God
himselfe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this allegation of Christ
teacheth vs, how to behaue our selues
against all enemies to the truth, that
would allure vs to heresie, as to Popery,
Anabaptisme or such like; namely to stick
fast to the text of Scripture, and not to
suffer our selues by any meanes to bee
drawen from it. It may bee thou art vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
and thine enemie both learned
and eloquent; yet heere is thy refuge,
cleaue the faster to this written word,
and if thou haue one text for thy truth,
make more account thereof, then of all
the restimonies of councels, fathers, or
men whatsoeuer. This instruction is
needfull, for it may bee God will suffer
seducers to try his children, and then, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
they keep sure this ground of faith,
they shall surely be seduced.</p>
            <p>The text which Christ alledgeth for
his answer, is taken out of <hi>Deutr.</hi> 6. 13.
where the words are thus read; <hi>Thou
shalt feare the Lord thy God, and serue
him.</hi> At the first, it may seem that Christ
misalledgeth that text, and corrupteth
it: for where Moses saith, <hi>Thou shalt feare
the Lord thy God;</hi> Christ saith, <hi>Thou shalt
worship the Lord thy God:</hi> and to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part Christ addeth the word <hi>onely;</hi>
saying, <hi>him onely shalt thou serue,</hi> for that
which Moses saith, <hi>and serue him.</hi> But
the truth is, heere is no corruption, but
a most worthy allegation, as wee shall
plainly see, if wee consider two things:
first, that Christ and his Apostles in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
the Scriptures of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
did not so much respect the words
as the true and proper meaning of the
place. Secondly, that they oft expound
the places which they alledge, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
do sometimes vary in word, but stil
retaine the true sense and meaning. So
it is in this text alleaged: Moses saith,
<hi>thou shalt feare the Lord thy God,</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
by <hi>feare, religious awe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neronce:</hi>
And Christ saying, <hi>thou shalt
worship or adore the Lord thy God,</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth
by worship, outward adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in bowing of the body, whereby we
testifie the inward awe and reuerence of
the heart, as when we humble our selues
to call vpon God by praier. And this
change of words by Christ, serues for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
vse in this place, to wit, to let vs
more clearly see what this feare of God
is. <hi>To feare God</hi> in that place is from a
reuerent awe of the heart towards God
to humble a mans selfe in prostrating
his body before the Lord, either to
praise God for benefits receiued, or to
pray vnto him for gifts and graces need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
Againe, for the word which he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
therein is no fault at all, for the ful
sense and true meaning of Moses text
must needs include so much, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
annexed in the verse following
doth plainly shew: for saying <hi>thou shalt
feare the Lord thy God and serue him:</hi> and
adding,<note place="margin">Vers. 13.</note>
               <hi>Thou shalt not walke after other
Gods,</hi> vers. 14. is it not all one, as if hee
had said, <hi>thou shalt serue him only?</hi> so that
we haue inst cause to blesse God for the
true and plaine explaning of the words,
and not to surmise the least corruption
in the alledging of them.</p>
            <p>Now then for our further instruction
in this text alledged, consider two
points: first, what worship and seruice is:
secondly, to whom it belongeth. First,<note place="margin">Worship in generall.</note>
               <hi>worship</hi> in generall betokeneth, <hi>the exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting
and giuing of reuerence and honour
to another.</hi> This worship is two-fold;
Ciuill,<note place="margin">Ciuill worship</note> or Diuine; Ciuill worship is that
outward reuerence and honour which
one man giues to another, as by prostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the body, bowing the knee &amp;c. The
end of Ciuill worship is, to testifie and
acknowledge superiority and prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
in another, either for authority
and office, as the subiect worships his
king and gouernour; or for gifts and
graces, or for old age; as inferiours in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:16197:29"/>
gifts and yonger in age by due reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
must acknowledge. In this Ciuill
maner did <hi>Iacob bow himselfe euen times
to his brother Esau,</hi> thereby acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
him for his superiour and better,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 33. 3. Thus also did <hi>Abraham bow
himselfe before the Hittites, Gen.</hi> 23. 7.
And <hi>Lot vnto the Angels that came into
Sodome,</hi> taking them to be but men, <hi>Gen.</hi>
19. 1. And in this ciuill maner it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to kneele before Kings and Princes,
to testifie our subiection vnto them, and
loyall acknowledgement of their prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence
ouer vs vnder God.</p>
            <p>Diuine worship is the ascribing of
Diuinity to the thing we honour,<note place="margin">Diuine worship</note> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we make it vnto vs some diuine thing
aboue the order of any creature. A man
may ascribe Diuinity vnto a thing foure
waies: first, by attributing the Godhead
vnto it, or giuing vnto it such honour
whereby he acknowledgeth the same to
be God. <hi>Secondly,</hi> by ascribing vnto it
the attributes of God, as omnipresence,
omnipotency, to bee most iust, to know
all things &amp;c. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> by accepting and
acknowledging it to be the Creator and
Gouernour of all things. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> by
acknowledging it to bee the giuer of all
good things, the defender and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
from all euill. And to whatsoeuer
thing in worship a man ascribes any of
these, to the same doth he ascribe Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
This diuine worship doth princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
consist in religion and piety; for
by religion, which indeed is Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and by piety, do men ascribe vnto
a thing diuine and religious honour.</p>
            <p>Diuine worship is two fold: Inward in
the mind; or outward in the body. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
diuine worship is, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man giues
his heart &amp; soule to any thing, deuoting
thereto the affections of his heart, as
loue, feare, ioy, hope, faith and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and that because he conceiueth
it to be God, hauing diuine properties,
as omnipotency, infinite wisedome, iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
mercy, &amp;c. or being the Creator
and Gouernour of all; or the giuer of all
good things vnto him, and his preseruer
from all euill. This deuoting of the
heart and soule vnto God with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
&amp; affections therof, is the ground
and substance of all diuine worship, and
indeed can be giuen to nothing but to
that which is God, or conceiued of as
God. Outward diuine worship is, when
a man shall any way bow, prostrate, or
cast downe his body to any thing, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to testifie, that his mind and heart are
deuoted to it: as that hee holds it to be
God, to be omnipotent, &amp;c. Creator and
gouernour, and his preseruer, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee doth repose his trust and affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
therein, set his loue, joy, and feare
thereon aboue all other things.<note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene ciuill worship and diuine.</note> And
heere wee may obserue a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
Ciuill worship and Diuine. By
outward ciuill worship we only acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
preheminence and superiority in
another, in regard of authority, of gifts,
age or such like. But by outward diuine
worship wee acknowledge diuinity to be
in the thing wherto we bow or prostrate
our selues. Againe, wee must heere also
remember, that outward diuine worship
serues onely to restifie the inward, euen
to make knowen what thing it is which
wee conceiue to be God, and whereto
wee haue deuoted the affections of our
hearts.</p>
            <p>Thus we see what worship is, and the
kinds thereof. And heere we must vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
our Sauiour Christ to meane,
<hi>outward diuine worship,</hi> as if hee should
say, Thou shalt religiously submit, bow
or prostrate thy body vnto God in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or thanksgiuing, thereby testifying
that thou hast deuoted thy heart and
soule vnto him, not onely conceiuing
him to be the diuine essence, omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
infinite &amp;c. but also that thou doest
rest and relie on him as on thy Creator,
who doth blesse thee with all good
things and preserue thee from all euill.</p>
            <p>Besides this worship, Christ doth
mention <hi>a seruing of God,</hi> which being
distinguished from worship must needs
import some other thing.<note place="margin">Seruice.</note>
               <hi>Seruice</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
is nothing else but the giuing and
performing of obedience to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
of another. This seruice is
twofold;<note place="margin">Absolute.</note>
               <hi>absolute,</hi> or <hi>in part. Absolute</hi>
seruice is, when a man obeies the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
of another without any
condition or exception, and that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in body outwardly, but in soule and
conscience, in thought, will &amp; affection.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:16197:30"/>
And this absolute seruice is proper to
God alone, for wee must neuer call his
commandements into question, but
looke what God commands and as hee
commands it, so must we simply and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
yeeld obedience thereto, not
only outwardly in body, but inwardly in
soule and spirit with the powers and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
thereof, and in all the affections
of our heart.<note place="margin">In part.</note> 
               <hi>Seruice in part,</hi> is that which
is due to gouernours and superiors from
their inferiours in the Lord: for God
hath giuen power to magistrates heere
on earth to make lawes for the good of
ciuil estates, in yeelding obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
their inferiors must doe them ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice;
yet not absolutely, but with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint,
to wit, in the Lord, so far foorth
as their commands agree with the wil of
God, and crosse not his command. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
our obedience vnto them is in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and outward conuersation: indeed
we must from the heart yeeld seruice and
obedience vnto them: but yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
properly cannot bee bound by
mens lawes, they only concerne the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man in speech, gesture and behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
Now of these two kinds of seruice,
our Sauior Christ speaketh here, of sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and absolute seruice, whereby both
soule and body with all the powers and
parts thereof yeeld absolute obedience
and subiection to the will and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
of God.</p>
            <p>Wee see what worship and seruice is
heere required: Now wee must obserue
the person to whom the same is to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
in these words: <hi>The Lord thy God:</hi>
Diuine worship whether inward or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and absolute seruice of the whole
man, must be giuen to no creature, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
or man, be they neuer so excellent,
but to the true God alone. The scope
and drift of the first and second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
is to bind euery man to
giue so much to his God, and to beware
of giuing the same to any other besides
the Lord. And the practise of the good
Angell that talked with<note n="a" place="margin">Reu. 19. 10.</note> Iohn, doth
shew the same thing, for when Iohn fell
before his feet to worship him, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
said, <hi>see thou do it not:—worship God.</hi>
Where we see the good angels do striue
for the furtherance of Gods right in
these duties, howsoeuer this wicked spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
tempting Christ, doth heerein seeke
Gods great disgrace. And thus we may
perceiue that Christs applying of this
text against Satans temptation is most
pregnant; for Satan requiring of Christ
the prostrating of his body before the
Diuell, in token that he did worship him
as the giuer of those kingdomes which
he offered vnto Christ, is iustly repulsed
by this text, which bindeth euery man to
giue outward diuine worship, whereby
the inward worship of the heart is sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified,
to God alone and not to any
creature.</p>
            <p>Heere then we may learne,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> that it is
not lawfull to giue to Saint or Angel,<note place="margin">No creature must haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine worship.</note> or
any creature whatsoeuer, outward di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
worship or adoration, whereby the
inward deuotion of the heart is testified.
This text is plaine to the contrary, and
the reason we haue heard, because di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
prostrating of the body to any
thing, is a testification that we ascribe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity
vnto it some way; which without
the guilt of idolatrie cannot bee done to
any creature: for let a man worship Saint
or Angell by praier or thanksgiuing, and
therein he doth ascribe vnto them some
propriety of the diuine nature, as, to
know the heart, to be able to heare, to
helpe or such like. The Papists heere
say, they doe not thinke the Saints to
whom they pray, to be God, neither do
they worship them as God. But this
will helpe them little: for the Diuell
mouing Christ to yeeld vnto him out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
diuine worship, neuer meant, that
Christ should adore him for God, but
onely desired, that by this outward ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of prostrating his body before
him, Christ would acknowledge him to
be the giuer of those kingdomes, (for he
durst not be so bold as absolutely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be worshipped for God) and yet
Christ tels him, that outward diuine
worship euen in respect of the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
of such a gift is proper to
God alone. And yet the church of Rome
do giue vnto Saints, that which the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
demands and Christ denies by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriating
it vnto God: for they make
seuerall saints deliuerers and protectors
from seuerall diseases and dangers: as
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:16197:30"/>

of afflictions. Yea they make them

<hi>Spaine;</hi> Saint <hi>Denis</hi> for <hi>France;</hi> Saint <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricke</hi>
for <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp;c. Now sith many a
one may giue a kingdome that cannot
defend it let all men iudge whether they
doe not giue more vnto Saints, than Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
demanded to be acknowledged vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him by our Sauiour Christ: yea they
make them intercessours for the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the sauour of God and life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting:
they call the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> the
<hi>Queene of Heauen,</hi> and pray to her, that
by the authority of a mother, she would
command her sonne to heare their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
which is to make Christ a punie
and vnderling vnto her; which are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
matters then the disposing of earthly
kingdomes. Heere they say, that they
may do that to the glorious saints in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
which is done to earthly Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
for men adore them and in their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
fall downe before their chaire of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.
<hi>Answ.</hi> The adoration giuen to
Princes, is but a ciuill acknowledgement
of their preheminence: and kneeling
before their chaire of estate, is only a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil
testimony of loyaltie and subiection;
it is not directed to the Princes person
being absent, but only serueth to testifie
his subiection to that authoritie and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
which is set ouer him in the Lord;
there is no diuine propriety ascribed by
either of these vnto the person or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Prince. But now in bowing
down to pray to Saints, there is religious
adoration giuen them, for therein be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
vnto them these diuine proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that they can know the heart, heare
and helpe afarre off, pray for them in
particular, and such like; by all which
God is robbed of his honour.</p>
            <p>And though we condemne the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
for giuing to Saints diuine worship,
yet wee must beware of despising the
Saints of God in Heauen: for there is
due vnto them a threefold honour: first
thanksgiuing to God for them, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
them by his gifts and graces, to
be in their times, speciall instruments of
good vnto Gods church. Secondly, we
are to carrie a reuerent estimation of
them being now in heauen, as of the
friends of God and temples of his holy
spirit. Thirdly, we are to follow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of their godly conuersatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in the
duties of godlinesse: But from giuing
vnto them diuine worship we must care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
abstaine.</p>
            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Worship of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note> if the diuine worship of saints
be heere condemned, then much more
is the worshipping of their reliques: then
also is their instituting and obseruing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
daies and holy daies vnto their
saints heere iustly reproued. Neither can
our Church heerein be condemned with
them, though wee retaine the names of
such daies among vs, because it is for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
end; out fasts are meerely ciuill
on such daies; and our holy dayes tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from the adoration of saints to the
seruice of God, whereon also our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
knowes her libertie giuen of
God for honest labour in a lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
as neede requires.</p>
            <p>Further, obserue how Christ heere
ioines the <hi>worship of God</hi> and the <hi>seruice</hi>
of God together: teaching vs not to
content our selues with doing the duties
of Gods worship, but withall wee must
yeeld vnto him absolute seruice and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.
Men commonly thinke they
haue done enough, if on daies appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
they come to the Church and there
performe outward worship vnto God
in hearing the word, in praier, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the Sacraments; these, I confesse
be worthy workes if they be well perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
but heerein is the common errour,
that when they haue performed this
outward worship they make no consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of <hi>absolute seruice,</hi> the thing which
Christ heere ioines to worship; they
thinke that in their callings they may
liue as they list, either idly or vniustly,
by fraud and dissembling: but seuer
not thou seruice from worship, which
Christ hath ioyned together, lest God
say vnto thee forthy worship as hee did
once to the Iewes<note n="a" place="margin">Isay. 1. 14. 15.</note> 
               <hi>My soule hateth your
new moones and your appointed feasts, they
are a burden vnto me, &amp;c.</hi> What, doth
God hate that worship himselfe appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:16197:31"/>
no, but he hares the seuering of it
from seruice and obedience wherein
they should shew foorth to their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
loue, iustice and mercy: he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
all seruice at their hands, because
<hi>their hands were full of blood, v. 15. Read
Micha. 6. v.</hi> 6. 7. 8. The offering of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
was a speciall part of worship vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law, and yet though a man
should bring for his sacrifice <hi>thousands of
Rammes, or ten thousand riuers of oile,</hi> nay
though he brought <hi>his first borne, the
fruite of his body for the sinne of his soule,</hi>
yet all is nothing without <hi>iustice, mercy,
humbling himselfe and walking with his
God, vers.</hi> 8. Let vs therefore serue God
sincerely in our conuersations, as wee
seeme to honour him in duties of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
let vs shew the feare of God in our
liues; for worship without seruice, is
like <hi>the cutting off of a dogs head, or offering
swines flesh &amp;c.</hi> as <hi>I say</hi> 66. 3. which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination
to the Lord.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, obserue that Christ addeth
<hi>only</hi> to Moses words, for the better clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of Moses meaning; which may
serue for our iust defence against the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists;
they blame vs greatly for teaching
that a man is iustified by faith <hi>only,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the word <hi>only,</hi> is not in any place ascribed
to iustification by faith. We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
in all the old testament this word
<hi>only</hi> is not ioyned to this command,
<hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and
serue him,</hi> and yet Christ saith, <hi>it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
him only shalt thou serue,</hi> because the
restraint and inhibition annexed, from
giuing this worship and seruice to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
doth in effect include <hi>only;</hi> euen so,
though in letters and syllables we doe
not find this word <hi>only,</hi> adioyned to this
sentence, <hi>man is iustified by faith;</hi> yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the exclusion of workes vsually
annexed to that phrase, as that, <hi>we are
iustified by faith without the workes of the
Law, Rom. 3. 28. and are iustified freely by
his grace, v. 24. and that a man is not iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the workes of the Law, but by faith,
Gal.</hi> 2. 16. hereupon I say we may hold
and teach, and that truly, according to
the true sense thereof, following Christs
example in this place, that the scripture
saith, <hi>a man is iustified by faith only.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, from this commandement we
must learne our duty touching Gods
seruice: in word we wil all acknowledge
our selues to be his seruants, but if heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we will approue our selues to be his
seruants, we must resolue and labour
to yeeld vnto him absolute obedience,
as well in hart, mind, will and affection,
as in outward conuersation. The end of
the ministery of the word is not onely to
reforme the outward man, but<note n="a" place="margin">2. Cor. 10. 4. 5.</note>
               <hi>to cast
downe</hi> the inward <hi>holds</hi> of sinne in the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination;
<hi>and to bring into captiuitie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery

And this is done when after true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance

               <p>
                  <hi>Then the Diuell left him,

vnto him.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>THese words containe the third part<note place="margin">Christs happy issue in these temptations.</note>
of this description of Christs temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
to wit, the happie euent and is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
thereof, in Christs glorious victory
ouer the Tempter; which is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
part, wherein consists the maine
comfort of Gods church; for as in temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
Christ stood in our roome and
stead, so is this victory not his a lone, but
the victory of his Church. This issue
conteines two parts. First, Satans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
from him. Secondly, the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of good Angels vnto him.</p>
            <p>For the first, <hi>Then the Diuell left him:</hi>
that is, after that by temptations he
could nothing auaile, then he betakes
himselfe to flight. In this appeares the
vnspeakeable mercie of God vnto his
Church, in mitigating, and in due time
putting an end vnto the afflictions and
temptations thereof; for the case of
Christ the head in this conflict, is the
case and condition of all his members.
Now heere we see what a gratious issue,
the Lord put to these great assaults of
Satan; in due time his enimie flies: and
so will the Lord deale in all the miseries
of his Church, &amp; children: God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
to Dauid concerning Salomon,
<note n="a" place="margin">2. Sam. 7. 14.</note>that <hi>if he sin, hee will chastise him with the
roddes of men, and with the plagues of the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:16197:31"/>
children of men:</hi> that is, with such puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shments
as he shall be able to beare, <hi>but
his mercy he will not take from him.</hi> The
Prophet Habacucke in his complaint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the wrong &amp; violence of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
done to the iust, is somewhat <hi>impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
towards God for his delay. Hab.</hi> 1. 2. 3.
Therefore in the vision afterward she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
vnto him, he is bid to <hi>waite for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance,

come and shall not stay, Cha.</hi> 2. 3. Thus Paul
comforteth the Christian Corinthians,
<hi>God is faithfull, and will not suffer you to be
tempted aboue that which ye are able to
beare, but will giue an issue with the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
that ye may be able to beare it; 1.
Cor.</hi> 10. 13.<note n="a" place="margin">Reu. 11. 8. 9. 10.</note>
               <hi>The bodies of the two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
who were slaine for the testimony of
the Lord Iesus, are suffered to lie in the
streetes vnburied, for three daies and an
halfe,</hi> that is, for some short time; which
being expired, <hi>the spirit of life comming
from God shall enter into them and reuiue
them; then feare shall take their enimies,
but they shall ascend vp to heauen, and their
enemies shall see it.</hi> All these doe plainly
manifest Gods great mercie in giuing a
gracious issue to the troubles of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
yea by good experience we may see
the truth heereof in the happy issue that
the Lord hath put to the most fearefull
temptations of sundry in our time, who
haue beene exercised therein, some for
a yeare or two, other for longer time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
many yeares together, and yet in the
end haue sung the song of ioyful deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:
it may be some of Gods children
beare the Crosse to their dying day, yet
the Lord sustains them in it by his grace,
and in the end shewes them mercy and
peace.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in this departure of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
from Christ, we may obserue a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
difference between the first Adam,
and the second. The first Adam was
tempted and ouercome therein; Satan
preuailed in that conflict, and brings
him captiue into his kingdome, hauing
spiritually taken possession of him. The
second Adam is tempted also, but the
Diuell can find no meanes whereby to
preuaile with him: <hi>the prince of this world
commeth, but hath nought in mee,</hi> saith
Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 30. But after his assault
is faine to flie away.</p>
            <p>Further, in this departure of Christ
note two circumstances: <hi>when</hi> Satan de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
and for <hi>how long</hi> a time. First,
<hi>when</hi> he departed is noted in this word
<hi>then,</hi> that is after the third temptation;
when Christ in indignation for his blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
against God had said, <hi>Auoid Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan;</hi>
and withall had answered his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
out of the written word, then he
departs. Hence we learne:</p>
            <p>First, that the best way to vanquish sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
is to giue him no ground,<note place="margin">Giue Satan no ground.</note> but to
withstand him manfully at the first: <hi>Iam.</hi>
4. 7. <hi>resist the Diuell and he will flie.</hi> Now
Satan is resisted, when from our hearts
we cast our soules on the promises of
God conteined in his word, and in the
whole course of our liues pray for
strength of grace to stand against all his
assaults: whereby wee may see the great
error and deceit of those, who accompt
of Satans temptations as of fits of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie,
and thinke they may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued
by musicke, merrie company
and such like; but these are no weapons
to driue away the Diuell. Secondly, this
also shewes their dangerous course who
yeeld to Satans temptations for a time,
taking their pleasure in their youth, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
to resist him when they are olde
and then to repent: too many take this
course, but it is fearefull: for thus doing,
they set open al the doores of their heart
to the Diuel, and suffer him to take qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
possession, little considering that it is
beyond their power to dispossesse him
at their pleasure: For indeed heereby
they become like to a man that is sick of
the dropsie, who the more he drinks, the
more he desires; so hee that willingly
giues place to Satans temptation, the
more he sinnes, the more he may; for the
longer he is tempted, the more by yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
is he weakened, &amp; the greater is the
danger of his endlesse confusion: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
learne of Christ to resist betime.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in this circumstance, note
that when Christ rebuketh Satan and
bids him auoid, hee departs and is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
gone. Was this any vertue in satan
that hee doth thus readily depart at
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:16197:32"/>
Christs command? no verily,<note place="margin">Satans obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable.</note> though he
obey, it is not praise worthy: for obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
is two fould, voluntary, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained;
voluntary, when the creature
doth Gods command without compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
thus Adam did before his fail, and
all holy ones that are iustified and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
doe thus in part in this life: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
obedience is, when the creature
is made to obey God, wil he nil he. This
is like to the obedience of rebels, who
being attached and arreigned for their
treasons, in suffering are made to obey
the Princes lawes. And such was this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
of Satan, forced vpon him by
the powerfull command of Christ, who
is Prince and Lord of all creatures. And
this is to be marked, that when Christ
giues foorth his powerfull command,
then Satan must obey whether he wil or
not. This is euident by his manifold di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spossessions
of vncleane spirits, who
came foorth at his command, though
they accompted him as their tormenter.
Now that which heere befals the Diuell,
shall one day bee verified of all wicked
men; if they will not now obey God
willinglie, while in the ministerie of the
word he bids them <hi>repent, and beleeue the
Gospell;</hi> they shall one day bee compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
euen at the dreadful day of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
wil they, nil they, to obey that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
voice of Christ, <hi>Depart from mee yee
cursed into euerlasting fire, Mat.</hi> 25. 41. In
regard whereof, wee must euer be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
now in the daie of grace, to yeeld
vnto Christ voluntary and cheerefull o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
vnto all his commandements
both of the Law and Gospell, lest one
day wee be constrained to obey in going
to our endlesse wo: Satan who is a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand-fold
stronger then man, could not
resist his power; how then shall wee that
are but dust and ashes stand before so
great a God?</p>
            <p>This circumstance of time is more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
noted by S. Luke, saying,<note n="a" place="margin">Luc. 4. 13.</note> 
               <hi>and when
the Diuell had ended all the temptation, he
departed from him:</hi> whereby thus much
is signified, that look what knowledge,
craft, or power the Diuel had, that did
he imploy to the vttermost in these tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
before he left our Sauior Christ.
Whereby it appeareth that Christ was
tempted in the highest degree and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
that Satan possibly could attain vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
herein did the Diuell shew the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of his fraude and malice against
Christ; which further appeares by this,
that the Angels of heauen came and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
vnto him for his comfort; so as
though Satan could not taint the sacred
heart of our Sauior Christ with the least
spot of sin; yet in these temptations
Christ was troubled with the same for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,
griefes &amp; vexations, which Gods
children vsually feele in their temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
The consideration whereof serues
for speciall vse.</p>
            <p>First, to keepe all Gods children<note place="margin">A good ground against despaire</note>
from despaire in the greatest extremity of
their temptations, euen when they shall
feele their conscience (as it were) set on
an Iron racke, and the slashings of hell
fire alreadie kindled in their soule: for
Christ Iesus the head of the Church was
tempted by Satan in the highest degree,
so as the Angels came to minister com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
vnto him, and yet he still remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the welbeloued sonne of God; and
so may any of Gods children remaine
Gods deere elect, euen then when the
violence of Satan shall seem most to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
against them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this teacheth vs to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
all rash iudgment in our selues, of
all such as shall bee exercised by Satan in
extreame temptations: for oft it will fall
out that the conscience of Gods child
shall bee so exceedingly tormented in
temptation, that hee shall cry out, he is
forsaken of God, and shalbe damned;
when as indeed he stil remains the deare
child of God, as Christ our Sauiour did
Gods welbeloued in the deepest assaults
of Satan. And therefore the relation
published of Francis Spira his desperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Francis Spira</note>
doth inconsiderately taxe him for a
cast-away; considering that nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel
him in the time of his desperation but
that which may befall the child of God:
yea our owne land can afford many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
which match Francis Spira, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we regard the matter of his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or the deepnesse of his desperation,
who yet through the mercy of God
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:16197:32"/>
haue receiued comfort. And therefore
in this case Christian charity must euer
bind vs to thinke and speake the best.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Satans departing vpon the
ending of these three temptations, giues
vs to vnderstand, that howsoeuer the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel
abound with temptations of all sorts,
yet these three are the ground of all, and
the most principall temptations that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
hath; for in this combate he did his
worst, &amp; shewed the violence of his rage
and wrath. And therefore it wil need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for vs to take special notice of them,
as also of Christs repulses giuen vnto
them, that so wee may be the better ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
against them and the like. Thus
much for the time when Satan departed.</p>
            <p>The second circumstance touching
his departure is, for how long the Diuel
left him, noted by Saint Luke, not for
euer,<note place="margin">Luk. 4. 13.</note> but <hi>for a season.</hi> Some may say, we
doe not find that Satan tempted Christ
euer after this, saue only vpon the crosse,
where he <hi>spotled principalities and powers,
Coloss. 2. 15. Answ.</hi> The Diuell tempts
men two waies: sometime by himselfe,
as he did our Sauior Christ in this place
and vpon the crosse, and our first mother
Eue in the garden, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 1. sometime
by men whom hee vseth as his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
thus he tempted Adam by Eue;
and Iob, by the Chaldeans and Sabeans
that robbed him, and by his friends who
sought to draw him from his integrity,
<hi>Iob.</hi> 27. 5. now though Christ were not
often after this tempted immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
by the Diuel, yet by Satans instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
he was many times sore assaulted
to the greefe of his heart, as by the <hi>Iewes,</hi>
the <hi>Scribes,</hi> and <hi>Pharisies, Herod,</hi> and
<hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> who required signes of
him, mocked and persecuted him.</p>
            <p>Heere we may see a notable patterne<note place="margin">The state of Gods Church on earth.</note>
of the state of Gods Church &amp; children
in this world, for looke as Christ their
head is sore tempted, and then let alone,
and yet but for a season, being tempted
againe by Satans Instruments; so fareth
it with them, one while they are exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with outward temptations, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
while with inward assaults; then
through Gods mercy they haue free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
for a season; but afterward Satan
comes vpon them againe, either by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
or by his instruments: which must
teach vs wisdome in regard of the state
of our own Church in particular, town,
that we must not dreame of a perpetuall
freedome from trials and temptations,
howsoeuer through Gods mercie wee
haue inioyed admirable peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
for many yeares together; for
being a part of Christs mystical body we
must looke for the same condition with
our head Christ Iesus, who being sore
tempted of Satan was left but for a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and after tempted againe: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee must resolue our selues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
that trials will come; what
way, God only knoweth; but the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of affliction will follow our haruest
of ioy and peace: and the yearely visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
by plagues &amp; famine, are symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes,
that is, signes &amp; foretunners of
more heauy iudgments, vnlesse we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
to meete our God in the practise of
speedy and vnfained repentance. And
as this is the state of our Church in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
so is it the particular condition
of euery Christian, whose life is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
intercourse of trouble and peace,
and therefore euery child of God must
be watchfull against security, and with
the end of one assault, ioyne his prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for a new: This was the state of
Christ, and the seruant must not look
to be aboue his master. And thus much
for the Diuels departure.</p>
            <p>The second part of the Issue of this
conflict is the ministery of the angels vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christ; <hi>And behold the Angels come and
ministred vnto him.</hi> In saying <hi>Behold,</hi> the
Euangelist commends to our considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the view of a great wonder, to wit,
that that person whom the Diuel would
haue had to haue worshipped him, is
here worshipped and serued of the holy
Angels of God. Let no man therefore
iudge of himselfe, by that which Satan
would perswade him to in temptation;
Christs estate doth now appeare farre
different from that which Satan would
haue brought him to, &amp; so shall all Gods
children find it to bee with them after
temptation, if therein they fight man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
after the example of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:16197:33"/>
Touching the ministerie of these An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
here obserue three points. First, the
bond that causeth the good Angels to
minister vnto Christ. Secondly, their
number. And thirdly, the time of their
ministery.</p>
            <p>I. Point. The bond of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
is Christs soueraignety ouer the
Angels, not onely as hee is God their
Creator, but as hee is mediator God and
man, euen the man Christ, (I say not
the manhood of Christ) but Christ (as
I may say) the man-God, is Lord of all
Angels, and they doe him homage and
seruice. And though the man-hood of
Christ be not Lord of Angels, yet being
receiued into the vnity of his God-head,
it is thereby exalted aboue all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
by many degrees. Wherin we may
behold the endlesse goodnesse of God,
in aduancing our nature, which by sinne
was made more vile then al earthly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
far aboue the Angels in degree,
by reason of this coniunction which it
hath with the nature of God in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Christ.</p>
            <p>Now as by this bond the Angels are
made ministers vnto Christ, so by vertue
of the same, they become ministers to
all his true members. Iacobs ladder is
thus expounded by our Sauiour Christ:
<hi>verily,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 51.</note> 
               <hi>verily, I say vnto you, heereafter
shall ye see heauen open, and the Angels of
God ascending and descending vpon the son
of man.</hi> This <hi>sonne of man</hi> is <hi>Christ,</hi> who
being God and man reacheth from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to earth, and from earth to heauen;
to him the Angels minister, and by him
they descend to minister to all the saints
of God heere on earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The vse.</hi> 1. This teacheth vs to admire
the endlesse goodnesse of God vnto his
Church and children, not onely in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing
heauen and earth vpon them,
but euen giuing his glorious Angels to
become ministring spirits for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
defence, &amp; comfort. II. This
their ministery, must admonish vs to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
our selues reuerently and holily in all
maner of conuersation. If we were in the
presence of an earthly Prince, oh how
carefull would we be to our behauiour
both for words &amp; actions? Much more
then should the presence and attendance
of Gods glorious angels, who pitch their
tents about vs if we be Gods children,
make vs circumspect to all our waies; and
the rather, because their ministery is for
our comfort and protection, while wee
keepe our selues in the straight waies of
God.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>point.</hi> Their <hi>number.</hi> It is not said
<hi>one Angel,</hi> but <hi>angels</hi> came and ministred
vnto him. Indeed when hee was in his
Agonie in the garden a little before his
passion,<note n="a" place="margin">Luc. 22. 4<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>one Angell came and ministred
comfort vnto him:</hi> so that sometime one,
sometime moe attended on him; euen
as the euill spirits come to tempt, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
one alone, as Satan did heere to
Christ, and somtimes moe, as they did
when he was vpon the Crosse. And as
it befell Christ, so doth it to Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
they haue somtime one good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
to attend vpon them, and sometime
many: so likewise haue they sometime
one euill spirit to assault them, and som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
many, as the man in whom the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
was. And heereby falleth to the
ground this common opinion, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man hath one good Angell and one
bad attending vpon him, the one to
protect him, the other to tempt him.
But this opinion doth not wel stand with
the tenour of the scripture, which thus
sets out the state of men in regard of his
attendance by Angels, that there are
somtimes moe about him, and somtime
fewer; whether we speake of good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
or of euill spirits.</p>
            <p>III <hi>Point.</hi> The <hi>time</hi> when these
good Angels came and ministred vnto
Christ, <hi>is</hi> noted in this word <hi>Then;</hi> that
is, when the Diuel had done all he could
against our Sauiour Christ: they came
not in the time of his assaults, but when
Satan had ended his temptations and
was gone. There is no doubt, but the
good Angels were alwaies about our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior
Christ attending on his blessed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but at this time it is like they tooke
vpon them some visible shape, that so
their ministery might be the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
vnto him; as it is like, the diuel
appeared in some shape for Christs gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ater
terrour in his temptations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:16197:33"/>
In this circumstance of time,<note place="margin">God will some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time hide his mercy from his children.</note> we may
obserue a worke of Gods prouidence
which he pleaseth to exercise in the time
of temptation vpon his owne children;
to wit, for a time to hide his mercy from
them, withdrawing the sensible feeling
of his fauour. Thus he dealt with his
beloued some Christ Iesus, during the
time of Satans violent temptations he
concealed from him the sensible assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the ministerie of his Angels,
they shew not themselues till Satan is
departed. And so fareth it many times
with Gods deere children vpon whom
he bestowes the good graces of his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
as a nourcing-mother to try the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of her childe, will sometime hid
her selfe from it, leaue it alone, and
suffer it to take a knocke or a fall; so wil
the Lord leaue his children to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
&amp; conceale from them the signes
of his fauour, suffering them to be buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
in temptation for a time, that they
may find thereby what they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
without Gods grace, and by fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the bitternesse of that estate, the
more to hunger and thirst after his grace
and fauour, the more ioifully and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to embrace it when it is renued,
and the more carefully to keepe it all the
daies of their life. What made Dauid
to accompt so highly of the courts of
Gods house, as that he esteemed the
silly<note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 84. 1. 2. 3.</note> 
               <hi>birds happy that might build their
nests by Gods altar,</hi> but his banishment
thence, by the persecution of Saul wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
hee was constrained to remaine in
<note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 120. 5.</note>
               <hi>Meshech, and to dwell in the tents of Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar?</hi>
And so when the people of God
were in Babell, <hi>remembring Zion they
wept;</hi> oh then,<note n="b" place="margin">Ps. 137. 1. 5. 6.</note> 
               <hi>let my right hand for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
to play, if I forget thee O serusalem; let
my tongue cleaue to the roofe of my mouth
if I prefer not Ierusalem to my chiefe ioy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But vnto many this doctrine of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
will seeme to small purpose,
nay altogether needlesse, for that they
neuer felt any such conflicts with the
Diuell, they defie him from their harts,
and they trust to God neuer to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with him: this is the common e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
of most men (those onlie excepted
who haue felt how hard a thing it is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to repent and beleeue) thus to blesse
themselues in a carnall peace; but sillie
soules, they know not their owne hearts
nor the fearfull case in which they stand;
for all the true members of Christ must
be made conformable vnto their head;
now <hi>he was consecrated the prince of their
saluation through afflictions, Heb.</hi> 2. 10:
his soule was heauie vnto the death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he could finish the worke of our
life: yea he is tempted by Satan before
he is comforted by the Angels; those
therefore that were neuer tempted haue
yet no fellowship in his afflictions, they
haue not begunne any conformitie with
Christ, so as it is like they are still bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaues
vnto Satan, for if they had esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
out of his snare, they should feele
his assaults to get them in againe: in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
heereof the childe of God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to buckle hard with Satan in
temptation, and to pray many a time to
be deliuered from his buffeting. And
indeed howsoeuer for the present this be
not ioyous, yet they <hi>may count it excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
great gladnesse,</hi> as the<note n="c" place="margin">Iam. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Apostle saith,</hi>
not onely for this triall of their faith
which bringeth forth patience, but also
because herein they become like vnto
Christ in his humiliation, which may
giue them assurance that they shall be
like him in glorie:<note n="d" place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 11. 12.</note> 
               <hi>for if we be dead with
Christ we shall also liue with him, and if we
suffer we shall also raigne with him.</hi> Adde
further that these men that neuer felt
the assault of Satan, are as yet vnder a
most fearfull iudgment of God in <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of heart.</hi> When Christ sedde fiue
thousand men with fiue loaues and two
fishes,<note n="e" place="margin">Mark. 6. 41.</note> 
               <hi>he distributed it by the hands of his
disciples;</hi> But after it is said, <hi>they perceiued
not this matter of the loaues,</hi> and this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is rendred, <hi>because their harts were
hardned, vers.</hi> 52. And so it is with them
that neuer feele the temptations of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
for he goeth about continually like
a roaring Lion seeking whom he may
deuoure, as they whose hearts are not
hardned do well perceiue. To conclude
therefore, let these men who yet neuer
felt in themselues these assaults of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
vnfainedly endeuour to change the
course of their liues by the practise of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:16197:34"/>
true repentance in eschewing euill and
doing good; let them giue themselues
sincerely to the exercise of praier for the
remouall of their stony hearts, and the
renuing vnto them hearts of flesh, let
them heare the word and doe the same;
and then they will shortly sing another
song, to wit, <hi>that whosoeuer will liue godly
in Christ Iesus must suffer temptations and
be assaulted by the Diuell;</hi> and then will
they finde that this doctrine is needfull,
yea they wil blesse God for this worke of
his spirit that caused these temptations
of Christs to be so particularly recorded,
with his happy issue and victory ouer
them all, not only for himselfe but for
all his members, that in their temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
they may looke vnto Iesus, lest they
should faint in their minds, for <hi>in that he
suffered and was tempted he is able to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
them that are tempted,</hi> Heb. 2. 18.</p>
