            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And although in the meane while after lawfull and inforced abdication of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Emperour, and our Election, through Gods ſingular prouidence and ſpeciall Grace, by the vnanime, orderly, and vnrepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable conſent of our loyall Eſtates of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and the Countries appertaining thereunto, wee haue deſired and aymed at nothing more then that the moſt hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and deuouring combuſtion, warre, and diſquietnes of theſe Countryes might ſpeedily bee appeaſed and redreſſed: As alſo that by the ripe, wiſe, prouident and carefull aduiſe and counſaile of our moſt illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cozens, Allies and Friends, together with the conſent and wills of our loyall Eſtates, Subiects and Countries, wee haue not refuſed, but rather vpon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious well meaning motions (long ſince) haue accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of and agreed vnto, and offered our Aduerſaries to enter into a comodious Truce, ceſſation of Armes, and peaceable treaty, and (aſmuch as poſſibly in vs ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, without impairing of our Royall Dignity, State, Honour and reputation) to proceed therein, That thereby the long deſired Peace &amp; tranquilitie of theſe Countries, by our helpe might bee reſtored and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhed, the moſt cruell and vnſpeakable tyranny, murtherings and deuaſtations auerted, the baniſhed wholſome Tranquility reobtained, and the Countries reſtored into their former priſtinate and peaceable

            <p>From whence it is eaſily to be gathered, and firmely to be concluded, that the intent and meaning of our Aduerſarie tendeth to this onely end and ſcope, that vnder the coulorable name of ſoueraigne Authority, together with many additions, hee may obtaine ayde and aſſiſtance, and thereby inſinuate himſelfe into the good will of diuers renowned Potenrates aſwell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as without the Empire, yea and of the meer vaſſailes and dependants of this our Crowne of <hi>Bohemia:</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they haue already made an entrance, by bringing in of forraine Souldiers, contrary to the ordinances and liberty of the Empire of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all (by Oath) ratified capitulation.</p>
