            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

honorable) hauing by the power of
his word, created Heauen and Earth,
with all thinges what soeuer, for the
comfort and vse of Man: the last of
all other (euen the sixt daye) made
Man after his owne similitude and
likenesse, that in him he might be glorified aboue all
other Creatures. And therfore, wheras in making of
other thinges, he vsed onely this Woord, FIANT, be they
made, or let them be made: when he came to make Man,
as it weare aduysing himselfe, and asking councell at his
wisdome, he said, FACIAMVS HOMINEM, let vs make<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Man,
that is a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful Creature: and therfore is called in greek
MICROCOSMOS, a litle world in himself. And truely he
is no lesse, whether we consider his spirituall soule, or his
humaine body. For what Creature is theare vppon the
face of the Earth comparable to man, either in body or in
mind? what creature hath a soule immortall inherent in
his body, but onely Man? what Creature can forsee things
<pb facs="tcp:18544:3"/>
to come, remember things past, or iudg of things present,
but onely man? what Creature beareth the ymage of God
about with him, but Man? what Creature is made so erect
to behould the Heauens, as man? What Creature may be
likened to man, either in proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of body, or gifts of the
soule? And (finally) what Creature hath the promise of the
resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; glorificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their bodies, &amp; of eternall life
but onely Man? Than seeing the Lorde hath made Man
thus glorious, and preferred him in euery degree, before al
other Creatures (the Angelicall Creatures set a part) it is
manifest, he hath done it to some end &amp; purpose, namely,
that he might be glorified in him, and by him aboue all
other his works, according to the measure of his integritie
excellency and perfection. And hereby we may learn that
it is the will of GOD, that we bend all our force to the
aduauncing of his glorious Name, the edification of his
People, and the building vp of his Church, which he hath
redemed with the bloud of his deare Sonne.</p>
            <p>Which thing (mee think) is notably figured foorth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs in the .25. of EXODVS wher the Lord commaunded
Moyses to build him a Tabernacle, or howse of prayer, to
this end and purpose (doubtles) that therin his lawe might
be read, his Ceremonies practised, Sacrifices, Victimates &amp;
Holocaustes offred, and his glorious Name called vppon
and obeyed. To the erection wherof, euery one conferred
some what, some brought gold, some siluer, &amp; some brasse,
lead &amp; tinne, other brought silk, purple, skarlet, and other
ornaments, and the meanest brought some what, namely,
skins heare, sand, lyme, morter, wood, stone, and such like.
Euen so (right honorable) would the Lord haue euery one
to conferre some what, euen such as he hath, to the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of his spirituall howse, the Church purchased with
the bloud of Christ. Wherfore seeing it is so, that euery
one is to further this spirituall building to his possible
power, I haue rather chosen with the simplest, and meanest
sort to bring, though but heyre, sand, skins, lyme, morter,
<pb facs="tcp:18544:3"/>
wood or stones, than altogether to contribute nothing.</p>
            <p>Not doubting, but that the chief Maister and Builder
of this howse, Christ Iesus, will not dislike, but accept of
my poore contribution, no lesse than he did of the poore
wydowes Mite, to whom was imputed that she had cast
more, in Gazophilatium Templi, into the treasury of the
Temple, than all the rest: for what she wanted in effect,
that she supplyed in affect, And for that also the Lord our
GOD committing his tale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to euery one, whether more
or lesse, not onely requireth of vs the same againe simply,
but also, as a straight computist, demaundeth interest and
gaine of euery one of vs: &amp; for that not only, he is a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer
&amp; a Homicide before God, who slayeth or killeth,
a Man with materiall sword<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he also, vho may preuent
the same, and will not. And not onely, he is guiltie of
haynous transgression that committeth any euill really,
but also he who consenteth to it as he doth, who holdeth
his peace, or he who by any means might auoid it, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for negligence wil not, or for feare of the world dare
not. Therfore, albe it, that I haue receiued, but one poore
tale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or rather the shadow of one, yet least I might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
(with that vnprofitable Seruaunt) for hyding my
small talent in the Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not profiting therwith at all, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
my self, or others, I haue adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tured the making of this
litle treatise, intituled, (The Anatomy of Abuses,) hoping
that the same (by diuyne assistance) shall somewhat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to the building of this spirituall howse of the Lord.</p>
            <p>And although I be one (most honorable Lord) that can
do least in this Godly course of life (palpable barbarisme
forbidding mee so much as once to enter into Wysdomes
school) yet for that somewil not, for feare of losing world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
promotion (though in the meane tyme they lose the
Kingdome of Heauen,) Other some dare not for displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the world: I say, for these, &amp; semblable causes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
with the zeale and goodwill I beare vnto my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and feruent desire of their conuersion and amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="tcp:18544:4"/>
I haue taken vpon me the contryuing of this book:
Which GOD, graunt may be with like plausible alacritie
receiued, as with paines and good will, I haue published
it, for the benefit of my Cuntrey, the pleasure of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and amendement of the wicked. And I doubt not,
that as none, but the wicked, and peruerse whose gawld
backes are tutched, will repyne against mee, so the Godly
and vertuous, will accept of this my labour, and trauaile
herein, whose gentle fauour and goodwill, shall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoyse,
(and farre surmount with mee) the maligne sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks,
and stearn countenances of the other. After that
I had (right honorable) fully perfected this booke, I was
minded, notwithstanding, both in regard of the straunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the matter it intreateth of, and also in respect of the
rudenesse of my penne, to haue suppressed it for euer, for
diuerse and sundrie causes, and neuer to haue offred it to
the viewe of the world. But, notwithstanding, being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by the importunat request, and infagitable desire of
my freinds, I grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to publish the same, as now you see,
is extant.</p>
            <p>But, when I had once graunted to imprinte the same, I
was in greatter doubt than before, fearinge, to whome I
might dedicate the same so rude and impolished a worke.
And withall I was not ignorant, how hard a thing it is in
these daies to finde a Patrone of such books as this, which
sheweth to euery one his sin, and discouereth euery Mans
wicked waies, which indeed, the vngodly ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not at any ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
abyde, but as it were mad-me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> disgorging their stomacks
(Cum in Authore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tum in codicem plenis buccis,
&amp; dentibus plusquàm caninis rabidè feruntur:)
they rage, they fume and rayle both against the AVTHOR
and his booke. Thus (vacillante animo) my minde
wandring too and fro, and resting, as it weare in extasie
of despaire, at last I called to mind your honorable Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
whose praises haue pearced the Skyes, and whose lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
vertues are blowen, not ouer the realme of England
<pb facs="tcp:18544:4"/>
onely, but euen to the furthest costs and parts of the world.</p>
            <p>All whose vertues, and condigne prayses, if I should
take vppon mee to recounte, I might as well number the
starres in the Sky, or grasse of the Earth.</p>
            <p>For, for Godly Wysdome, and zeale to the truth, is
not your good Lordship (without offence be it spoken)
comparable with the best? For sobrietie, affabilite, and
gentle curtesie to euerie one, farre excelling many.</p>
            <p>For your great de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

your Soueraigne, loue to the CVNTREY, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
in generall, euerie where most renowmed.</p>
            <p>But least I might obscure, your Worthie commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
with my vnlearned penne, (lytle, or no thing
at all emphaticall) I will rather surcease, than further
to proceed, contenting my selfe rather to haue giuen a
shadowe of them, than to haue ciphered them foorth,
which indeed are both infinit, and inexplicable.</p>
            <p>In consideration (whereof) not withstanding that
my Booke be simpler, baser, and meaner, than that it may
(without blushing) present it self to your good Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
(being farre vnworthie of such an honorable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage)
yet accordinge to your accustomed clemency
I most humbly beseache your good Lordship to receiue
the same into your honors Patrociny and protection, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
it as an infallible token of my faithfull heart,

For proofe whereof, would GOD it might once

protesting before Heauen and Earth, that though

the same to the guardance and defence of your honour,
rather than to manie others, not onely for that GOD hath
made your honour a Lamp of light vnto the world, of true
nobilitie and of al integritie and perfection, but also hath
made you his substitute, or vicegerent, to reforme vices,
punish abuses, and correcte sinne.</p>
            <p>And as in mercie he hath giuen you this power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie,
so hath he giuen you a hungrie desire to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
the same according to his will: Which zeal in your
sacred brest, the LORD increase for euer.</p>
            <p>And as your Lordship knoweth, reformation of maners
and amendement of lyfe, was neuer more needfull, for,
was pride (the chiefest argument of this Booke) euer so
rype? Do not, both Men and Women (for the most part)
euery one in generall go attyred in silks, veluets, damasks,
satans, and what not? which are attyre onely for the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
and gentrie, and not for the other at anie hand? Are
not vnlawfull games, Playes and Enterluds, and the like
euery where vsed? Is not whordome, couetousnes, vsurie &amp;
the like daylie practised without all punishment or lawe?</p>
            <p>But hereof I say no more, referring the consideration,
both of these and the rest, to your Godly wysdome. Besea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seaching
your good Lordship, to perdon my presumption
in speaking thus much, for (Zelus domini huc adegit me:)
the zeal of my God hath dryuen me heather.</p>
            <p>Knowinge, that the LORD hath ordeined you, to
himselfe a chosen vessell of honour, to purge his Church
of these Abuses, and corruptions, which as in a table are
depainted and set foorth in this litle booke.</p>
            <p>Thus I cease to molest your sacred eare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:18544:5"/>

            <head>A PREFACE
TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Thought it conuenient (good
Reader,</hi> who soeuer thou art, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
shalt read these my poore labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res)
to admonish thée (least hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> mightest take my woords
otherwise than I meant them)
of this one thing: That wheras in the processe
of this my booke, I haue intreated of certen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercyses,
vsually practised amongest vs, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Playes and Enterludes, of dauncing, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
and such other like: I would not haue
thée so, to take mée, as though my speaches ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
to the ouerthrowe and vtter disliking of all
kynd of exercyses in generall: that is nothing
my simple meaning. But the particulare Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
which are crept into euery one of these seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
exercyses, is the onely thing, which I think
worthie of reprehension.</p>
            <p>For, otherwise (all Abuses cut away) who séeth
not, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> some kind of playes, tragedies and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luds
in their own nature, are not onely of great
ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie, but also very honest and very commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
<pb facs="tcp:18544:6"/>
exercyses, being vsed and practised in most
Christian common weales, as which containe
matter (such they may be) both of doctrine, eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
good example and wholsome instruction?
And may be vsed in tyme and place conuenient,
as conducible to example of life and reformation
of maners. For such is our grosse &amp; dull nature,
that what thing we sée opposite before our eyes,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o pearce further, and printe déeper in our harts
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd minds, than that thing, which is hard onely
with the eares, as <hi>Horace,</hi> the hethen <hi>Poët</hi> can
witnesse. <hi>Segnius irritant animum, dimissa per
aures, quàm quae sunt hominum occulis obiecta.</hi>
So, that when honest &amp; chast playes, tragedies,
&amp; enterluds, are vsed to these ends, for the Godly
recreatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the mind, for the good example of life,
for the auoyding of that, which is euill, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of that which is good, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are they very tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
exercyses. But being vsed (as now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
they be) to the prophanation of the Lord
his sabaoth, to the alluring and inuegling of the
People from the blessed word of God preached,
to Theaters and vnclean assemblies, to ydlenes,
vnthriftynes, whordome, wanto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, drunke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes,
and what not? and which is more, when they
are vsed to this end, to maintaine a great sort of
ydle Persons, doing nothing, but playing and
loytring, hauing their lyuings of the sweat of
other Mens browes, much like vnto dronets de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> swéet honie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore labouring bees,
<pb facs="tcp:18544:7"/>
than are they exercyses (at no hand) sufferable.
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> But being vsed to the ends that I haue said,
they are not to be disliked of any sober, and wise
Christian.</p>
            <p>And as concerning dauncing, I wold not haue
thée (good <hi>Reader</hi>) to think that I condemne the
exercyse it self altogether, for I know the wisest
Sages and the Godlyest Fathers and Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
that euer liued, haue now and than vsed the
same, as <hi>Dauid, Salomon,</hi> and many others: but
my woords doo touch &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerne the Abuses there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
onely. As being vsed vppon the Sabaoth
day, from morning vntill night, in publique as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
and frequencies of People, Men &amp; wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
together, with pyping, fluting, dromming,
and such like inticements to wantonnesse &amp; sin,
together with their leapinges, skippings, &amp; other
vnchast gestures, not a few. Being vsed, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
abused in this sort, I vtterly discommend it.</p>
            <p>But vppon the otherside, being vsed in a mans
priuat-chamber, or howse for his Godly solace,
and recreation in the feare of GOD, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
abroade with respect had to the time, place
and persons, it is in no respect to be disalowed.</p>
            <p>And wheras I speake of gaming, my meaning
is not, that it is an exercise altogether vnlawful.
For, I know that one Christian may play with
another, at any kind of Godly, honest, ciuile ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
or exercise, for the mutuall recreation one of
the other, so that they be not inflamed with co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueitousnes,
<pb facs="tcp:18544:7"/>
or desire of vnlawfull gaine: for the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t saith, thou shalt not couet: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if any be voide of these affections, playing ra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
for his Godly recreation, than for desire of
filthie lucre, he may vse the same in the feare of
God: yet so as the vse therof be not a let, or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance
vnto him, to any other Godly exploit.</p>
            <p>But, if a man make (as it weare) an occupation
of it, spending both his tyme and goods therein,
frequenting, gaming howses, bowling allyes,
and such other places, for gréedinesse of lucre, to
him it is an exercise altogether discommendable
and vnlawfull. Wherfore, as these be exercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
lawfull, to them that know how to vse them
in the feare of GOD, so are they practises at no
hand sufferable to them that abuse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as I haue
shewed. But take away the abuses, the thinges
in themselues are not euill, being vsed as instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to Godlynes, not made as spurres vnto
vice. There is nothing so good, but it may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused,
yet because of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> abuses, I am not so strict,
that I wold haue the things, themselues remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
no more than I wold meat and drinke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
is abused, vtterly to be taken away.</p>
            <p>And wheras also I haue spoken of the excesse
in Apparell, and of the Abuse of the same, as wel
in men, as in women generally, I wold not be
so vnderstood, as though my speaches exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, to
any, either noble, honorable, or worshipful: for, I
am so farre from once thinking that any kind of
<pb facs="tcp:18544:8"/>
sumptuous, or gorgeous attire is not to be worn
of any of them, as I suppose them rather Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in them, than otherwise.</p>
            <p>And that they both may, and for some respects,
ought to were such attire (their birthes callings,
functions and estats requiring the same) for cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in this my Booke laid downe, as maye ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
and for the distinction of them from the
inferiour sorte, it is prouable both by the Woord
of GOD, Ancient Writers, and common
practise of all ages, People and Nations, from
the beginning of the World, to this day.</p>
            <p>And therfore, when I speake generally of the
excesse of Apparell, my meaning is of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
sorte onely, who for the most parte do farre
surpasse, either noble, honorable, or worshipfull,
ruffling in Silks, Ueluets, Satens, Damasks,
Taffeties, Gold, Siluer, and what not? with
their swoords, daggers, and rapiers guilte, and
reguilte, burnished, and costly ingrauen, with all
things els, that any noble, honorable, or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull
Man doth, or may weare, so as the one
cannot easily be discerned from the other.</p>
            <p>These be the Abuses, that I speake of, these
be the euills, that I lament, and these be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that my words doo concerne, as the tenure
of my Booke consideratly wayed, to any indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<hi>READER</hi> doth purport.</p>
            <p>This much I thought good (Gentle <hi>Reader</hi>)
to informe thee of, for thy better instruction, as
<pb facs="tcp:18544:8"/>
well in these few points, as in all other the like,
whersoeuer they shall chaunce to occurre in my
Booke. Beseaching thée, to construe al things
to the best, to beare with the rudenes therof, and
to giue the same thy good-woord, and
gentle acceptaunce. And
thus in the LORD,
I bid thée, fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>

Nation soeuer, vnder the Sunne, are so farre

eyther hosen, shoes, bands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ruffes, shirts,

damasks, grograins, taffeties, and such like.
So that herby you sée, that they speak vntruly
that say, that other nations exceede them in
brauerie of apparell. For it is manifest that
all other Nations vnder the sun how strange,
how new, how fine, or how comly soeuer they

appeareth that no People in the World is so
curiouse in new fangles, as they of <hi>Ailgna</hi> be.
But grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te it were so, and admit that others

euill, because they do so? shall their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

wherfore let vs not sinne of presumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with

they estéemed of them as much as we doe. So
that you sée they are forced of necessytye to

onely by vertue, being but a poore mans

me, being a Gentleman by byrth, and calling?
To whome the other answeared, thou arte no
Gentleman, for thy gentilitie endeth in thee
and I am a Gentleman, in that my gentilitie
beginneth in me. Meaning (vnlest I be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued)
that the wante of virtue in him, was the
decay of his gentility, and his vertue was the
beginning of true gentilitie in him selfe: for
virtue therfore, not for apparell, is euerye one
to be accepted. For if we should accept of men
after apparell onely respecting nothinge els,
tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shold it come to passe, that we might more
esteme of one, both meane by birth, base with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

more than of some by birthe, noble, by virtue
honorable and by callinge laudable. And the
reason is because euery one, tagge and ragge,
go brauer, or at least as braue as those that be

               <p>But I haue hard them reason thus.
That which is good in it own nature, cannot
hurt:<note place="margin">An argument trimly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryued.</note> apparell is good, and the good Creature
of God, <hi>ergo</hi> no kynde of apparell can
hurte. And if there be anie abuse in it, the
apparell knowethe it not. Therfore take
awaye the abuse, and let the apparell re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
still, for so it maye (say they) without
anie hurte at all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philo.</speaker>
               <p>These be well seasoned reasons, and
substantiall asseuerations in déed, but if they
haue no better arguments to leane vnto, than
these, their kingdome of Pride will shortlie,
fall without all hope of recouerie againe.</p>
               <p>The apparell in it owne nature is good,
and the good Creature of God (I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie)
<pb facs="tcp:18544:28"/>
and cannot hurte except it be thorowe
ouer owne wickednesse abused. And therfore
wo be to them that make the good Creatures
of God instruments of dampnation to them
selues, by not vsing them, but abusing them.
And yet not withstanding, it maye be said, to
hurte, or not to hurte, as it is abused, or not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused.
And wheras they would haue the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
of apparell (if any be) taken away, and
the apparell to remain still, it is impossible to
supplant the one, without the extirpation of
the other also. For it is trulye said, <hi>sublata

                  <note place="margin">Vnpossible to take away pride, except sumptuouse apparell be taken away also.</note> Take away the cause, and

               <p>And the reason is, these two collaterall
Cosins, apparell, and Pride (the Mother
and Daughter<note place="margin">Apparell and pride combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned togethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as mother, &amp; daughter.</note> of mischiefe) are so combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
together, and incorporate the one in
<pb facs="tcp:18544:29"/>
the other, as the one can hardlie be dyuorced
from the other, without the distructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them
both. To the accomplishmente wherof God
graunte that those holsome lawes, sanctions,

may be put in execution. For in my
opinion, it is as impossible for a man, to were
preciouse apparell, and gorgiouse attyre, and
not to be proude therof (for if he be not proud
therof, why doth he weare suche riche attire,
wheras meaner is both better cheape, easier

               <p>Sometimes they were them sharp on the

And as the fashions bee rare and straunge, so

               <l>But euer keep one forme to chuse</l>
               <l>Although they visite Nations strange.</l>
               <p>AND as all Writers doo affirme, all the
Women there, indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to with their
haire hanging downe, with a broade hat
vppon their heads, and other attyre as playne
as the rest, soo farre are these People from
Pride, and hunting after strange fashions as
our Women doo.</p>
               <p>The Women of <hi>Affrica</hi> are witnessed
by the fame <hi>Stuperius,</hi> and others, to be so
farre from affecting strange fashions, or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity
in aparel, that they cloth themselues in
a manner al ouer, <hi>ferinis pellibus,</hi> with beasts
skinnes, furres, and such like. And this they
think so riche attire, as they vse it altogether,
when they celebrat their festiual sole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne daies,
or when they go abrode to be séene.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Brasilian</hi> Women estéeme so litle of
apparell also as they rather chose to go naked
(their secret partes onely being couered) then
they wold be thought to be proud, or desirouse
of such vanities.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cantabrian</hi> Women likewyse with
many others do the same. In High <hi>Germany</hi>
the Women vse in effect one kind of apparel,
or habite, without any differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce at all, nothing
like other Natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s delighting in new fangles:
<pb facs="tcp:18544:54"/>
yea the wiues there, are so far from pride, that
they will not disdaine to carie all their house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould
stuffe and other trinckets about with
them vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their backs in tyme of extremitie.
These Mayds &amp; Uirgins go very plain, with
kerchers only on their heads, their haire han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
down behinde, in token of Uirginitie.</p>
               <p>Thus you see, euery Natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, how barbarous
soeuer, are much inferiour to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people of <hi>Ailg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
in pride &amp; excesse of apparell: and yet these
examples I alledge not to th'end I wold wish
all others to vse y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very like brutish
kind of auster habite, but to shew how farre
they be from Pride, &amp; how much the other be
wedded to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same. And as for the vertuous &amp;
godly christian women from the beginning of
the world, they haue so litle cared for the vain
glory of apparell, &amp; so litle (or rather nothing
at al) were they a quainted therwith, as they
hunted for nothing els so much as for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of the mind, as wisdom, continency,
chastitie, &amp; true godlynesse, thinking the same
bewtie sufficient. They cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted it great shame
to cloth their bodies with sumpteous apparel,
&amp; their minds to be naked, &amp; voide of true ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
So, if these wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wold seek after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mind, they wold not affect apparell so
much, for if they be faire in body alredy, than
néed they not gorgeous apparel to make them
fairer: &amp; if they be deforme in body, it is not y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18544:55"/>
that can make them fairer. And either their
bewtie consisteth in them, or in their apparel:
If in them, than not in the Apparell, &amp; so it is
meere foolery to were them. And if in apparel,
than not in them, and so cannot the garments
make them fayre, whome God, &amp; nature hath
made otherwise: wherfor, look in what shape,
forme, or condition euerye one is created by
God, let him content himselfe with the same,
without any alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or chaunge, with prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se

               <p>But so farre are some, from suffering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne

they get good maintenance with practising the

in publique assemblies &amp; conuenticles,
without respect either of sex, kind, time, place,

the dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of the people of the former world)
either priuatly or publiquely is at no hand to

Or if it be vsed for mans comfort,

all filthie, luxurious and vncleane daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
yet I condemne not al kind of dauncing
generally. For certen it is, the exercyse it self,
in it own nature, qualitie &amp; proprietie, though
to some it is lawfull, to othersome vnlawfull
in dyuerse respects, is both ancient &amp; general,
hauing been vsed euer in all ages, as wel of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

without any difference or respect had either to

in some respectes. Or els, if our daunces

               <p>It is so truely, for if they be good lawes tending
to the glorie of GOD, the publique
weale of the Cuntrey, and correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vices,
it is great pytie that money should buy them
out. For what is that els, but to sell vertue,
for lucre: Godlynes, for drosse, yea mens souls
for corruptible money? Therfore those that
sell them, are not onely Traitors to GOD,
to their Prince and Countrey: but are also
the Deuils Marchants, and ferrie the bodies,

               <p>And those that buy them are Traitors to
GOD, their Prince and Countrey also.</p>
               <p>For if the lawes were at the first good (as
GOD he praised al the lawes in <hi>Ailgna</hi> be)
why shuld they be suppressed for money, and
if they were euill, why were they diuulged,
but had rather béene buried in the wombe of
their Mother before thy had euer séene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> light.</p>
               <p>And why were lawes instituted, but to be
executed? Els it were as good to haue no

to haue good lawes, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not executed.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:18544:125"/>
to the destruction of many thousands? hath he
not caused the Elements and Skyes, to send

But certen it is, as there is a God, that will

more to be auoided than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poison of a serpent:
for the one slayeth but the body, but the other,

               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>No truely: For true repentance must
spring out of a lyuelie faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with an inward
lothing, hating and detesting of sinn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. But
this deferred repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce springeth not of faith,
but rather of the feare of death which he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>éeth
imminent before his eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the grief and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diousnes
of paine, of the Horror of Hell, and
feare of God his ineuitable iudgement, which
he knoweth now he must néeds abyde: And
therfore, this can be no true repentance. For
there is two maner of repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one a true
repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to life, the other a false repentance
to death: As we maye sée by <hi>Iudas,</hi> who is
said, to haue repented, and which is more, to
haue confessed his faulte, and which is most
of all, to haue made restitution, and yet was
it a false repentance. And why? because
it sprang not out of true faith, but as before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> repented, and wéept bitterly, and
was saued therby, though he neither made co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
nor satisfaction: and why? Because it
sprang of a true and lyuely faith. So these fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
may say they repent, but except it be a
<pb facs="tcp:18544:126"/>
true repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance springing of faith, it can serue
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no more to life than the pretensed repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of <hi>Iudas</hi> did serue him to saluation. Let
them beware, for <hi>Cain</hi> repented, yet is he
condemned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Esau,</hi> did repent, yet is he condemned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antiochus,</hi> did repent, yet is he condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
<hi>Iudas</hi> did repent, yet is he condemned,
with infinite moe: And why so? Because
their prolonged repentaunce sprange not of
faith, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus they may sée, that euerye light affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
is no true repentance: And that it is not
ynough to say at the last, I repent, I repent.
For, vnles it be a true repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce indeed, it is
worth nothing. But indeed, if it weare so, that
man had, <hi>liberu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> arbitrium,</hi> free wil of himself,
to repent truely when he wold, and that God
promised in his word to accept of that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
it weare another matter. But repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is, <hi>donum Dei,</hi> the gifte of God, <hi>de sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum
veniens a patre luminum,</hi> comming from
aboue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Father of light, &amp; therfore it is
not in our powers to repent when we will.
It is the Lord y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> giueth the gift, when, where
&amp; to whom it pleaseth him: &amp; of him are we to
craue it incessantly by faithfull prayer, &amp; not
otherwise to presume of our owne repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
when indeed we haue nothing lesse, than a
true repentance.</p>

               <p>Than thus much I gather by your
words, that as true repentance (which is a
certen inward grief, and sorrow of the heart,
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued for our sinnes, with a hatred and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of thesame) erueth to saluation thorow
the mercie of GOD in Christ, so fained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
saueth not from perdition.</p>
               <p>And therfore, we must repent dayly and
howrely, and not to deferre our repentaunce
to the last gaspe as many doo, than which, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more perilous.</p>

               <p>True it is, for maye not he be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a great Foole, that by deferring and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
of repentance to the last cast (as they
say) will hazard his body and soule to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
damnation for euer? Wheras by daily
repentaunce he maye assure him selfe both of
the fauour of GOD, and of life euerlasting
(by faith) in the mercy of GOD, thorow the
