            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>REASONS</hi> why thoſe of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> Challenged by <hi>George Keith,</hi> to meet him at <hi>Turner</hi>'s Hall the Eleventh of this Month called <hi>June,</hi> 1696. Refuſe their Appearance at his Peremptory Summons.</head>
            <p>WHereas <hi>G. K.</hi> hath after his wonted Irregular and Unruly manner, Challenged divers of us to Defend our Selves againſt ſuch Charges as he has to Exhibit againſt us at <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>'s <hi>Hall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Theſe are to Certifie all whom it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, That the Reaſons why we Decline any ſuch Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are as follow:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the ſaid <hi>G. K.</hi> has given us ſuch fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Proofs of his very paſſionate and abuſive Behaviour, at the many more Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Meetings we have had with him, in all manner of Sweetneſs, Long-ſuffering, and Patience on our ſide, to ſatisfie and preſerve him from theſe Extreams: That we cannot aſſure our ſelves now of any better Entertainment, or that the Meeting can have any deſirable Succeſs for a through Information.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We Decline to meet, becauſe it is not an agreed Meeting on both Sides, which it ought to have been; and where that is not, or cannot be Adjuſted, the Preſs is the next fair way and Expedient, which he has begun with, and now ſeems to decline; Nor hath he ſent us a Copy of his Charge or Indictment againſt us, which alſo he ought to have done.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That he has two of our Books which lie hard at his Door, in Vindication of us and our Doctrines from his Exceptions, and which he has not yet Anſwered; ſo that he is not upon Equal Terms with us; and therefore we think his <hi>Challenge, Appointment</hi> and <hi>Summons,</hi> unfair; and that all that are not partial will be of the ſame mind with us.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Such <hi>Publick</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlimited</hi> Meetings are too often attended with <hi>Heats, Levity,</hi> and <hi>Confuſion,</hi> and Anſwer not the End deſired by ſober and enquiring Men. Beſides, that it lets up a Practice that Authority may judge to be an <hi>Abuſe</hi> to our Liberty, and ſo draw that under Reflection, as no Friend to the Civil Peace.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We know not what Religion or Perſwaſion this Wavering Man is of, or what Church or People he adheres to, or will receive him, with his <hi>vain Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> that have led him to deſert us; Nor who are accountable to us for him and his Irregularities and Abuſes; the generality of ſuch Aſſemblies uſually making ill Auditors, worſe Judges, and no good Security for our Satisfaction. And we muſt therefore take leave to ſay, It ſeems to us an indirect way of <hi>Diſquieting</hi> and <hi>Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> our preſent Liberty, <hi>That ſo Irreligious a Meeting ſhould be held, whoſe End is to abuſe other Men for their Religion.</hi> If this ſhould be <hi>Imitated</hi> by all the ſeveral ſorts of different Perſwaſions in this City, what Heaps and Confuſions muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enſue!</p>
            <p n="6">6. Wherefore laſtly, Be it known unto all, That <hi>for the ſake of Religion, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty granted us,</hi> and <hi>the Civil Peace,</hi> we decline to meet him; and not from any Apprehenſions we have of his Abilities, or our own Conſciouſneſs of Error, or Injuſtice to the ſaid <hi>G. K,</hi> whoſe weak and unbridled Temper we know is ſuch, that what Learning and Parts he hath, have not been able to ballance and ſupport him on leſs Occaſions ſo that we may ſay they are in ill hands; and if he proceed as he begins, they will be employed to an ill End, which his (poor Man!) cannot but be, unleſs he change his Courſe; which we heartily pray for, that a place of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance he may find; and, through a true Contrition, the remiſſion of his great Sin of <hi>Envy,</hi> and <hi>Evilly Intreating</hi> the Lords People and Way, which we profeſs, and which he the ſaid <hi>George Keith</hi> hath long and lately both Profeſſed, and Zealouſly Vindicated, as ſuch.</p>
