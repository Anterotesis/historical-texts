         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To all thoſe who have newly Embraced
the Church of England, eſpecially whom
I have lately Baptized in this City; ſome
brought up by Quakers, others amongſt
Anabaptists.</head>
            <p>TIs the Honour of our Eſtabliſhed Church to carry the demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the beſt and happieſt Conſtitution in the World; whoſe
Articles are ſound, Canons and Diſcipline eaſy; whoſe Sacraments
are of our Lords own appointing; whoſe Ceremonies are but few, and thoſe
Decent; whoſe Orders are Apoſtolical, and Guardians watchful; whoſe
Prayers are truly Divine, and Preaching from the Word of God, not
from the Whims or Policies of Men; this Church, admired by the Learned,
even amongſt its Enemies, deſired and prayed for by all the truly Pious
abroad, deſpiſed and neglected at home only thro' the Prejudice and great
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappineſs of Education in ſome, and Willful Ignorance in others; this
Church, you now are become Members of, at your Earnest deſire, &amp; (as I
thank God, I have very good Reaſon to hope) after a due preparation. As
for this Diſcourſe, tis properly yours; twas prepared for you, and that with
a Plaineſs anſwering the Honeſty and Importunity which you diſcovered
in your Requeſt, both to underſtand and enjoy this holy Sacrament. And
thus to do, I found convenient, if not neceſſary, and to me very tempting; not
only as a Curate converſant with people, who (bleſſed be God) have had
the good Effect of convincing and informing ſome, who thought themſelves
Wiſe: But becauſe alſo of thoſe odd Notions and ſtrange Enthuſiaſtick
Fancies, which you formerly were, and others ſtil are teized and exerciſed
with, from their unteaching Guides; which inſtead of Comfort, have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
to the Ruin of their Proſelytes. Among the many proofs of this,
<pb facs="tcp:97062:3"/>
that ſad ſtory of the dearest Relation of one of you, will not yet be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
who under great perplexity of thoughts from ſome ſtrange Doctrines
amazing and diſturbing him, when he apply'd himſelf to his Teacher to
inſtruct and aſſiſt him, that he might find Peace and Comfort, receiv'd
from him only this Anſwer, <hi>Go Home, and get Faith.</hi> Which was
ſo far from eaſing his Troubled Mind, that he immediately fell diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
was obliged to be lyed and Bound in his Bed, and lived about a Week
in that dreadful condition, and then was relieved only by Death.</p>
            <p>But our Church, as it has no ſuch <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nintelligible Diſtracting Notions,
nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmerciful Tyranizing Diſcipline; ſo you receive this, containing
the true Chriſtian Doctrine of it; diſcovering the Bowels of the Mercy
and Love of our bleſſed Saviour, the Head of it; and Publiſhed at the
Requeſt of you, and your choſen Witneſſes, I hope for your Benefit, and the
Benefit of thoſe who are yet Ignorant of the Excellencies of now your
Church, and miſled by Crafty and Deſigning Men.</p>
            <p>And therefore, as when Inſtructing you, ſo in this Sermon, I attended
to the moſt eaſy, familiar, and apteſt Expreſſions to inform you; uſing in
Comments and Expoſitions, the beſt Authors, and ſometimes alſo (becauſe
I could not do better) their own words; Endeavouring to keep true to the
Orders, and excellent Doctrine of our Church, as every Faithful and
Honeſt Man ought to do.</p>
            <p>That the Honour of God, and Intereſt of the Church, might be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and that you and others may be bettered by this, and at laſt all our
Souls Saved, is the Prayer of,</p>

            <head>A
SERMON
Preached at the
BAPTIZING, &amp;c.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Acts II. 38.</bibl>
               <q>Then Peter ſaid unto them, Repent, &amp; be Baptized
every one of you, in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Occaſion of theſe words was this:
St. <hi>Peter,</hi> with great Earneſtneſs, had juſt
Demonſtrated to the <hi>Jews,</hi> the great Glory of
<hi>Chriſt:</hi> Who. tho' He was taken by wicked
hands, Crucified and Slain; yet did He Riſe again,
thereby making a perfect Conqueſt over the Grave, and
all the Powers of Darkneſs; and entering upon his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
as He is appointed an everlaſting <hi>King,</hi> whoſe
Dominion endureth from Generation to Generation, to
take Vengeance of all His Enemies.</p>
            <p>Of which theſe Men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> having from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
words clear Conviction, they ſtop their Mouths; (for
before they did but Scoff at the power of Godlineſs;)
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97062:4"/>
their Minds are now perfectly changed, they are very
ſenſible of their evil condition, <hi>were prick'd at their Hearts,</hi>
and with great Importunity and forward Earneſtneſs
apply themſelves to the Apoſtles for Relief, for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and Advice, in theſe extraordinary thoughtful
words, <hi>Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may not be amiſs to take notice of that part of
St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon that Introduces all this, and cauſed
ſo ſuddain an alteration in thoſe <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He very plainly argues the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and proves his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection;
beginning ver. 22. <hi>Ye Men of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>hear
theſe words,</hi> Jeſus <hi>of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>a man approved of God among
you, by Miracles, and Wonders, and Signs,</hi> &amp;c. And here
he tells them how barbarouſly they had dealt with the
<hi>Son of God,</hi> and their own <hi>Meſſias:</hi> And then he brings
to their remembrance ſome of the Prophecies of <hi>David,</hi>
and explains them, particularly of His Reſurrection,
<hi>That His Soul was not left in Hell, neither did his Fleſh ſee
corruption.</hi> Again, <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, Sit thou
upon my right hand, until I make thy Foes thy Foot-Stool.</hi>
This he proves <hi>David</hi> to ſpeak of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
v. 29. whoſe words may admit of this Comment:</p>
            <q>
               <p>Some amongſt you, perhaps, may conclude theſe
Prophecies to belong to <hi>David,</hi> and not to <hi>Jeſus:</hi> I
know you had a good value for that <hi>Royal Prophet,</hi> and
he deſerv'd it, being the <hi>Man after Gods own heart,</hi> bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of and beloved by Him: But let me be ſo free and
plain with you, as to adviſe, that you muſt not give to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97062:4"/>
him that is due to the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> The thing does
truly declare it ſelf; and this Prophecy neither agrees
with <hi>David,</hi> nor any other <hi>Prophet</hi> or <hi>Patriarch.</hi> As
for <hi>David,</hi> you all know well enough that he Dyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
was Buried, and never came to Life again; his Sepult<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chre
is with us to this day; there is nothing in it bur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dry
Bones and Duſt, and no ſign at all that he eve,
after Revived. And all this <hi>David</hi> knew very well,
that he ſhould fare like other Men; Dye, be Buried,
and molder to duſt in the Grave: Therefore he ſaid
none of theſe things of himſelf: but being Inſpired of
God, he knew that Chriſt ſhould be Born of his Line
and Family, be a moſt glorious <hi>King,</hi> and Reign for ever.</p>
               <p>And ſince it is plain that this <hi>Jeſus,</hi> this <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>David,</hi>
did not ſit upon his <hi>Fathers Throne:</hi> he muſt therefore
mean ſome other <hi>Kingdom</hi> and <hi>Throne,</hi> and he does
expreſs it to be ſuch an one too, as ſhall have no End.</p>
               <p>Now he could not ſit on this <hi>Eternal Throne,</hi> he could
not Reign in this his <hi>Everlaſting Kingdom,</hi> if after having
once ſubmitted to Death, he had not come to Life again.</p>
               <p>He therefore is riſen from Death to Life, on purpoſe
to enter upon this his <hi>Government,</hi> to ſit upon this
glorious Seat, the Seat of the <hi>Eternal Father,</hi> the
<hi>Lord</hi> both of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And all this <hi>David</hi> himſelf ſpoke of, and what he
ſaid ſo long ago, is now come to paſs. This ſame <hi>Jeſus</hi>
Dyed, You Crucifyed him, and he lay ſome time in
the Grave, but did not Putrefie there, making good all
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97062:5"/>
the Prophecies of him: For he roſe again to take
his <hi>Government,</hi> to enter upon his <hi>Kingdom.</hi> And we
are Witneſſes of all this; we ſaw him, have Eat,
Drank and Convers'd with him, ſince his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
and we are not, we cannot be Deceiv'd in
him; we knew him well in Perſon and Voice; and
beſides, we ſaw and felt his wounded Hands and
Side; and many others alſo can teſtifie the ſame, who
ſaw and heard him as well as we.</p>
               <p>And this very ſame <hi>Jeſus</hi> whom ye ſlew and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on a Tree, thus raiſed up by the Power of God, we
alſo ſaw aſcend into Heaven: And he, having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to ſend to us the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> from thence, has
now performed that too, which you cannot but own
by this evidence which you now ſee and hear, thoſe
ſeveral Languages we now ſpeak, which before we
knew nothing at all of, we never were bred up in.</p>
               <p>By all this it is very plain, That this ſame <hi>Jeſus</hi> is
advanced to His <hi>Kingdom;</hi> is now <hi>Lord</hi> over all; is
the very <hi>Meſſias</hi> promiſed in the Prophets, whom ye
look for; and who will moſt certainly one day take
Vengeance of all his Enemies.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This ſurprizing Relation, carrying with it ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
and Evidence, touch'd them to the quick,
who had conſented to the thing, and who had acted in
the Crucifying of Him; being fearful therefore now,
and apprehenſive of their great danger; and that they
were ſoon to be brought under His Foot-ſtool, they cry
<pb facs="tcp:97062:5"/>
out for help, they intreat the Apoſtles to relieve them,
they have no Patience, but begg as for Life, <hi>Men and
Brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle is as quick, has a Remedy at hand for
them, <hi>Repent, and be Baptized every one of you, in the
Name of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>There are ſome excellent Leſſons in this Sacred Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,
which, before we proceed, I ſhall but juſt mention.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle here charges the whole body of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
and eſpecially all the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> with that bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Murder of their <hi>King. Ye men of</hi> Iſrael (ſays he)
both High and Low, Great and Small, 'tis you that <hi>by
wicked hands have Crucified and Slain the Holy One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He could not but know that the Soldiers moſtly were
the Executioners: But the whole Nation being Guilty;
he charges all in general with it; thoſe who Conſented
to it, as well as the Actors, and thoſe who with mighty
Clamours cry'd out, <hi>Crucify Him, Crucify Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have indeed a Record of one not to be forgotten,
a Good Man and a Juſt. <hi>who did not conſent to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
and deed of them;</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 51. 'twas <hi>Joſeph</hi> of
<hi>Arimathea,</hi> who took worthy care of the Corps alſo,
whoſe Humanity therefore is Honourably noted. But
for the body of the <hi>Jews,</hi> they were all Guilty, as well
as the poor Heathen Soldiers.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Peter</hi> then teaches us, That in Preaching the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
of <hi>Christ,</hi> the firſt thing muſt be to Convince Men of
their Sins, to charge them home with them, and bring
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97062:6"/>
them to a general acknowledgment thereof, For, as no
Phyſitian knows well what to do with that ſick Patient,
who conceals, or diſſembles his Diſtemper: ſo, nor can
<hi>Chriſt</hi> profit any who will not be brought to a true ſence
of their Sins.</p>
            <p>For which reaſon <hi>Chriſt</hi> calls himſelf a <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> and
ſays, <hi>That He came to Heal the Sick;</hi> and again, <hi>Not for
the Juſt, but to call Sinners to Repentance.</hi> And the Office
of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> He ſays, <hi>is to Convince, and to Accuſe
the World of Sin.</hi> And in his laſt words to his Diſciples,
when he commands them to Preach <hi>Repentance;</hi> to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
them, he immediately joyns thereto <hi>Remiſſion of
Sins,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 47.</p>
            <p>Nor does the Apoſtle ſeem to charge the Mobb only,
the common Rout of Crucifiers, but their Captains too:
<hi>You,</hi> ſay he, <hi>who by wicked and unjuſt hands have ſlain,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Judas</hi> in the firſt place, once the <hi>Diſciple</hi> and <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> but now their Leader, and who deliver'd him to
them; ſo the <hi>High Priest,</hi> and all the Colledges of <hi>Scribes</hi>
and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who corrupted <hi>Judas,</hi> and gave him Mony
for his part in the Fact: <hi>Pilate</hi> too, who ſat in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
Seat, and gave the unjuſt Sentence againſt Him,
to gratify the importunity of the People; <hi>Herod</hi> alſo, in
whoſe power it was to let him go, who inſtead thereof
Mock'd Him, and ſent Him back to <hi>Pilate:</hi> All theſe,
tho never ſo Great, who were guilty as well as thoſe
common People who cryed out, <hi>His Blood be upon us, and
on our Children,</hi> the Apoſtle boldly charges, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Grandeur and Authority.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:97062:6"/>
Tho' by ſome it might have been eſteem'd no leſs than
Treaſon, to charge the Government with Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Injuſtice in their Sentence: yet he plainly does
it, without that wretched Fear, and thoſe fawning Hopes,
which too oft Tempts Men, even in good things, to
Prevaricate.</p>
            <p>And this is the Duty of every one who comes from
God: for, a <hi>Miniſter</hi> is a publick Perſon; an <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi>
and that from the <hi>Almighty:</hi> and his Buſineſs is to tell
his Maſters Mind, to deliver his Errands, diſcover his
Truths and Pleaſure only: and not to ſew Pillows un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Peoples Arms, not to bolſter them up in any of
their Errors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And tho' thus to do is ſomewhat Irkſome, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
Jeremiah <hi>complains,</hi> Wo is me that thou haſt made
me a Contentious Man, and a Man that ſtriveth with the
whole Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Jer. 15. 10. <hi>Tho' it appears uneaſie,
and troublous to thwart the Inclinations of Men, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
them of their own Humours, yet we find it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intimated in their Commiſſion, ſo the aforeſaid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
Jer. <hi>c. 1. v.</hi> 28. For behold, I have made thee a Defenced
City, and an Iron Pillar, and Walls of Braſs against the
whole Land, against the Kings, againſt the Princes, againſt
the Prieſts, and againſt all the People of the Land.</p>
            <p>In the next place, this Honeſtly and plain Dealing in
the Apoſtle, had very good effect upon thoſe <hi>Jews:</hi>
they were <hi>Pricked at the Heart:</hi> they were ſenſible how
ill they had done: they own'd their Evil Condition,
and looked out for help.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:97062:7"/>
This is the beginning of true Reformation, to be deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
impreſſed with their Guilt and Danger, to be really ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive
both of their Folly, and Deſperate Condition,
both of their want of a Saviour, and Miſery without him;
this will ſoon make the Sinner cry out with <hi>David, I
have Sinned, I acknowledge my Faults, and my Sin is ever
before me, Pſal.</hi> 51. 2. And this Senſe of his Condition
will Encourage him to call for relief, to ask Counſel
how to get out of ſuch a dreadful Condition, to cry out
in good earneſt, <hi>What ſhall we do to be Saved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, We ſee farther the good Nature and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Apoſtle, who as ſoon as they had diſcovered
the extraordinarineſs of their Concern and Miſery, does
not in the leaſt delay or diſpute their Cure: He does not
put them upon any Coſtly and Troubleſome thing to
Atone their Sin; neither does he Upbraid them for
their mighty Cruetly to the <hi>Bleſſed Jeſus,</hi> nor reflect any
more on what is paſt, their long Neglect or Careleſneſs;
but looks forward, helps them in Earneſt, tells them the
only, and that an eaſie and reaſonable Remedy; comforts
therefore their Hearts directly, keeps them no longer
in Suſpence, hides not their Cure, but ſays, <hi>Repent, and
be Baptized every one of you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>You ſee how proper this Subject is for our preſent
Diſcourſe, having juſt now receiv'd Perſons into the
Pale of the Church, who formerly were trained in
Errors, and by the Authority of Relations kept from
this happy Call.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:97062:7"/>
And ſince by their Earneſt deſire they have now En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
this bleſſed Sacrament, that as ſoon as convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
can be, they may be admitted to the other, let one
word firſt be permiſed concerning the holy Sacraments,
and their Number.</p>
            <p>Sacraments are the outward means whereby God does
Repreſent, Exhibit, and Seal to us our Redemption. And
they are called <hi>Signs,</hi> and <hi>Seals,</hi> and <hi>Badges,</hi> and <hi>Pledges:
As Signs,</hi> they repreſent the great performances of Chriſt
for us under Viſible Elements; <hi>Water</hi> repreſents his
waſhing away our Sins; the <hi>Bread Broken,</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi>
poured out, repreſent his <hi>Body Crucified,</hi> and his <hi>Blood
Shed</hi> for us. Thus are they Tokens and Monuments of
his Love, truly <hi>Signs</hi> of Heavenly things.</p>
            <p>By them Grace is exhibited and conveyed to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
Pardon enſured, and Favour and Reconciliation
obtained.</p>
            <p>They are the <hi>Marks</hi> and <hi>Badges</hi> of our Profeſſion:
they are our Lords <hi>Livery,</hi> by which all we his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
are known and diſcover'd to belong to him: they
proclaim us to be his Right and Property: ſo that all the
World may ſee and know what a <hi>Master</hi> we have, in
whoſe Service we are Engaged, and whoſe Favour and
Protection we ſhall be ſure always to Enjoy.</p>
            <p>And they are <hi>Pledges</hi> alſo, or <hi>Pawns</hi> of his Care and
Mercy, they are our Security of Heaven, and the ground
of our Hopes and Confidence in God. For, there is
an holy Contract betwixt God and us: <hi>Obedience</hi> is our
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97062:8"/>
part, <hi>Salvation</hi> is his; and by the Holy Sacraments, as
by <hi>Deeds</hi> and <hi>Indentures,</hi> is our Happineſs conveyed,
made over, Seal'd and Deliver'd to us.</p>
            <p>If we would be Saved then, it muſt be by theſe means,
and if we refuſe theſe means, the <hi>Pledges</hi> of his Love, the
<hi>Badges</hi> of our Profeſſion, the <hi>Securities</hi> of our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
we Rob our Souls of Heaven, we exclude our
ſelves from Salvation.</p>
            <p>Not that God cannot ſave without them, <hi>For his hand
is not ſhortned,</hi> but they are the ordinary Means, and
appointed Inſtruments, by which he has promiſed to
convey the Merits of Chriſt to us, and commanded us
this way to receive them.</p>
            <p>Willfully then to Neglect them, or to Want them,
when they may be had, is perfectly to deſpiſe God, and
caſt aſide his Ordinances.</p>
            <p>As for their Number, they are but two; tho' the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> has Eſtabliſhed more, yet the Ancients never
acknowledged anymore. Nay, one of the greateſt amongſt
the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> confeſſes it in theſe Words: <hi>'Tis a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
receiv'd ſaying amongst us Catholicks, That all the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
did flow out of the Side of the Lord, but thence only
Iſſued out Water and Blood; Water, as the matter of Baptiſm;
and Blood, of the Eucharist;</hi> and thence concludes, that
properly there is no more. Thus Cardinal <hi>Richlieu.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>True it is, that the Sacraments ſtrictly and properly
taken for Seals and Badges of our Profeſſion, they are,
and the Church never acknowledged anymore than two,
and thoſe of our Lords own Ordaining.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:97062:8"/>
The firſt, <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that ſignifies to <hi>Waſh,
Dip, Dive,</hi> or <hi>Sprinkle.</hi>

at, or after his laſt Supper.</p>
            <p>And theſe two he only inſtitutes; ſome have gueſſed
that the Goſpel Sacraments might correſpond with thoſe
two old ones of the Law, <hi>Circumciſion</hi> and the <hi>Paſſover:</hi>
But rather, becauſe theſe two are ſufficient.</p>
            <p>Nothing is required to make any one a true Maſter of
any Profeſſion than theſe two things. 1. To be legally
Enter'd, fairly admitted into it; and then, 2 To be
conſummate in it, to be fully poſſeſſed of the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
and Immunities of it.</p>
            <p>To Illuſtrate this, by what you all know very well.
In order to become a free Deniſon and worthy Member
of this Honourable City, or of any Society therein, this
is required, 1. That the Perſon be Lawfully Admitted,
you call it <hi>Bound:</hi> By which he is obliged to learn the
Art or Myſtery of his Profeſſion, is Engaged to the Rules
thereof, and at the ſame time is become the Care and
under the Patronage of the Governours of the City. And
having behav'd himſelf well in that Station, his appointed
time, he is then, 2. <hi>Made Free;</hi> has Title to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
and Immunities both of the City and his own
Society; to exerciſe his Function without Controul, and
in his Courſe to perform the Noble Duties, enjoy the
Offices, and receive the worthy Honours of the ſame.</p>
            <p>And as it is in theſe outward Worldly Societies; ſo
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97062:9"/>
is it in our beſt moſt Holy and Religious one, as we
are Chriſtians, Members of Chriſt Sons of Heaven,
and Heirs of Salvation.</p>
            <p>For, 1. By <hi>Baptiſm</hi> we are <hi>Bound;</hi> bound to the great
Father and Maſter of all the World; made Servants to
the moſt high God; one of his ſo glorious a Family;
Members of Chriſt; and under the Guidance, Inſtruction,
and Conduct of the Holy Ghoſt. And our Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
under that our Maſter, and in his Houſhold, is
to learn the Art of being and doing Good, the great
Myſtery of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>And in that High and Honourable Imployment, in
that Valuable Service, we are under the Care, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Protection, the Tuition and Inſtruction of
God the Son, from whom we receive all the Rules of
our Office, the Laws and Statutes of our Calling: And
in order to our moſt Faithful Service and abſolute Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
we are Aſſiſted, Comforted, Eaſed, Relieved,
and Sanctified by God the Holy Ghoſt. And then, 2.
In this Station behaving our ſelves Faithfully and Honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
till we underſtand our Buſineſs, know well our
Duty, and are fit to ſet up for the Practice of Piety,
willing to Devote our ſelves to that Imployment; we
are admitted then to our Maſters Table, to Eat and Drink
of thoſe his Holy Viands, in the other Sacrament of the
<hi>Euchariſt;</hi> and there Enjoy, in that Feaſt of Souls, the
Lord of all Glory, by which we are Fed and Nouriſhed
even to Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:97062:9"/>
And thus you ſee how your Earthly, does exhibit and
repreſent to you the Glory of your Heavenly Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and that if you would be Maſters, enjoy Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
even <hi>the glorious Liberty of the Sons of God,</hi> you muſt
firſt be <hi>Bound,</hi> muſt be admitted into the Family regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
and fairly, as he has Ordain'd; you muſt <hi>be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
every one of you, in the Name of the Lord Jeſus
Chriſt;</hi> and then proceed from one Degree of Grace
unto another; ſo you will obtain what St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
here aim'd at, <hi>viz. To be Everlaſtingly Saved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this reaſon it is that the <hi>Font</hi> ſtands at the lower-end,
but at our Enterance into the Church; where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been received and admitted into the Congregation,
and afterwards Inſtructed in our ſeveral Duties, till we

to be advanced to the Lords Table, that Holy Chriſtian.
Altar, at the Upper-end of all, the moſt Honourable
Place in Gods Houſe, that Royal Seat and Throne of
the Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus:</hi> Where Injoying him in thoſe his
appointed Elements in their Seaſon, during the Courſe
of our Lives, with Honeſt, Faithful, and Repenting
Hearts; we ſhall perceive the conſtant refreſhings of a
good Conſcience and Joyous Heart, and at laſt be
Tranſlated to the Everlaſting Arms of our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
and Enjoy Him in the higheſt Heavens.</p>
            <p>But the firſt of thoſe Holy Sacraments is our Province
now. In Diſcourſing upon which, we ſhall a little more
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97062:10"/>
particularly conſider, 1. The Nature, 2. The Neceſſity
of it, 3. The Qualifications for it, 4. The ſeveral Duties
we are Engaged in by it, 5. The extraordinary Benefits
and Advantages of it.</p>
            <p>1. For the Nature of <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> It was always a Cuſtom
amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> that when any Proſelyte was Receiv'd,
Enter'd, and Admitted into the Church, they were wont
to uſe ſeveral Waſhings, thereby denoting their Leaving
off, Forſaking, or Waſhing away all their former Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
their old Prophane and Heathen Practiſes: Nay,
the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Authors ſay, that not only Proſelytes, and
thoſe newly Converted from <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> but alſo the
Natural <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, were mitiated by theſe three
things, <hi>Circumciſion, Baptiſm,</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As this was the cuſtom amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo it pleas'd
the <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> the Author and Finiſher of our <hi>Faith,</hi> to
appoint, That whoſoever ſhould at any time be receiv'd
into His Family, admitted into His Houſe and Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
ſhall be receiv'd by this very ſame Ceremony and
Element of <hi>Water;</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> has order'd this
Form of words, <hi>I Baptize thee in the Name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Baptiſm then is the Door, by which we enter into
the viſible Church of Chriſt; and it is adminiſtred to
Beginners in Chriſtianity, who are Initiated by Water.</p>
            <p>This is done by <hi>Dipping,</hi> or <hi>Sprinkling,</hi> for the word
ſignifies both, and our Church makes the Action Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
leaving it to <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> and to be regulated by
<hi>Charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:97062:10"/>
Dipping was firſt in uſe in hot Countries, and when
the greateſt part were well grown People: But when the
Goſpel was ſpread into colder Climates, as ours, Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
only was thought ſufficient. And ſo does the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of our Church conclude, That if a <hi>Spoonful</hi> of Wine
in the other Sacrament, be as ſignificative of the whole
Maſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Blood,</hi> as a greater quantity; then a <hi>few
Drops</hi> of Water may be a repreſentative of Waſhing,
as well as a <hi>River.</hi> And this <hi>Sprinkling,</hi> perhaps, the
Apoſtles themſelves uſed, even in thoſe hot Countries,
ſince we Read of them calling ſometimes for Water
in Houſes, to Baptize new Converts, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 47.</p>
            <p>'Tis to be done <hi>in the Name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> Intimating, That what the
Miniſter does, is not of himſelf, or on his own head; but
in the Name and Power, by the Command and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of the whole <hi>Trinity; God the Father, God the Son,</hi>
and <hi>God the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> And this Obliging the Perſon
Baptized to own, 1. The Glorious <hi>Trinity</hi> of <hi>Perſons,</hi>
and conſequently the whole <hi>Creed,</hi> in the words of the
<hi>Church Catechiſm,</hi> to Believe in <hi>God the Father,</hi> who made
him and all the World. 2. In <hi>God the Son,</hi> who Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd
him and all Mankind; That is, who was pleaſed
to undergo the Wrath of His Heavenly Father, and all
thoſe Scourges due to our Sins, that we might be free
from Sin and Sorrow, the power and danger of Death
and Satan. 3. In <hi>God the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> who Sanctifies him,
and all the Elect People of God; That is, who Guides
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97062:11"/>
and Directs him, and who Comforts and Refreſhes him
in the ways of Godlineſs.</p>
            <p>As he thus owns and acknowledges the Holy <hi>Trinity,</hi> ſo
2dly. He yields himſelf an abſolute Proſelyte to the
<hi>Faith,</hi> of it, excluding all other Gods, or any other
Authors, and Patrons of Religion. The<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>3dly. He devotes himſelf to follow the Rules, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
the Comands of this his new Maſter, is always
ready to be Govern'd, and Guided by him; and by
all cheerful diſpatch of Religious Duties, demonſtrates
himſelf a very willing Diſciple of this Bleſſed <hi>Trinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Water,</hi> and theſe <hi>Words,</hi> is called the <hi>Form,</hi>
or the <hi>Outward</hi> part of <hi>Baptiſm:</hi> And they have a great
meaning in them, which is called the <hi>Inward;</hi> being a
<hi>Death to Sin, and a new Birth to Righteouſneſs:</hi> By Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Sin, is only meant leaving it off, waſhing away all
Pollutions, getting clear of them, out of the Power and
Dominion of them. The Apoſtle alſo calls it, <hi>A Quickening
of us, who were dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins.</hi> And St. <hi>John</hi>
calls it, <hi>Overcoming of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For nothing makes a Man more a Slave than Sin;
nothing betrays Men more to Servitude, then living in
Sin; nothing elſe but Sin can Domineer: He then that
overcomes it, is a brave Commander, is truly Maſter
of himſelf, and Enjoys the beſt Liberty.</p>
            <p>And now very plain appears the meaning of a <hi>New
Birth to Righteouſneſs, and being Born of God,</hi> mention'd
ſo frequently in Scripture; which is only our Lords
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97062:11"/>
Enabling of us to Live Religiouſly, and Act Honeſtly,
<hi>To have our Converſation here in Simplicity, and Godly Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity;
and to keep our Conſciences void of Offence both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God and Man:</hi> So we prove our ſelves Members
of Chriſt; and he will plentifully beſtow upon us the
Proviſions of his Grace and Favour, that is, Mercy, and
Peace, and Pardon of Sins here, and Eternal Life &amp; Glory
hereafter. I come now to the Second thing, To Conſider
the Neceſſity of <hi>Baptiſm:</hi> The Word is here, <hi>Be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
every one of you;</hi> and this is, if you have a mind to
be Saved. Beſides which, in St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, c. 3. v. 5.
<hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf ſays, <hi>Except a Man be Born of</hi> Water, <hi>and of
the</hi> Spirit, <hi>he cannot Enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> That
is, except a Man be Born again by the effectual working
of Gods Spirit, as by the Author of this <hi>New Birth;</hi> and
(in the ordinary courſe of Gods Proceedings in his
Church) by the <hi>Water</hi> of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> as the Sign appointed
by God in the Sacrament of our Regeneration, he
cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. Therefore
he ſays again, v. 7. Let not this ſeem ſo ſtrange a thing,
<hi>Marvel not that I ſaid unto you, You muſt</hi> thus <hi>be Born
again.</hi> And I think, that Chriſts own words, with ſuch
a Condition, that without it, they ſhall not obtain Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
is enough to urge the Neceſſity of this <hi>Holy Sacrament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What then do they do? What have they to anſwer,
who with hardned <hi>Confidence,</hi> and willful <hi>Obſtinacy,</hi> and
ſcornful <hi>Ignorance,</hi> keep themſelves and their Children
out of the Pale of the Church, refuſe and ſlight this
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97062:12"/>
               <hi>Great Grace,</hi> and ſhut themſelves out of <hi>Heavens Gate?</hi>
They are indeed in a moſt dreadful Condition, who tho'
<hi>Light be come into the World, will Love Darkneſs rather
than Light;</hi> and bereave both themſelves and off-ſpring
of that Happineſs, and thoſe mighty favours of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What Value have theſe Men for Gods Command, to</hi>
take the Sign and Seal of his Covenant of Grace to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and their Seed, throughout all Generations?</p>
            <p>What Value have they for Jeſus Chriſt, confirming
the ſame, when he ſent forth his Apoſtles and appointed
them to make all the Nations <hi>Diſciples,</hi> and to <hi>Baptize
them all in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt?</hi>
Which they did thro' all the World, where they came.
But more dreadfull ſtill is it, that the Men of this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion,
are generally ſo Stubborn and Reſolute, as to
be in Danger of never Repenting and Returning to the
Church: Some indeed, by the bleſſing of God, and a
good Diſpoſition, have led the way; may the reſt of
them Speedily follow; and let not that Fate and Doom
of a <hi>Reprobate,</hi> which is to be of ſtrong Deluſion, and to
<hi>Believe a Lye,</hi> (the worſt of all Judgments) let not that, or
its Imputation, any longer reſt upon them. I am thirdly to
ſpeak to the qualification for this Holy Sacrament, which
is <hi>Repentance: Repent and be Baptized.</hi> Repentance is
that that re-enſtates us in Gods Favour, aſſures our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
and makes Joy in Heaven. We all know our
ſelves, to be Fools and Vile Sinners; and when ever we
ſhall be brought to our Senſes, to acknowledge our Sin
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97062:12"/>
and Folly; we ſhall Act like Men, and make our ſelves
of the Number of thoſe that God will accept, that Chriſt
came to Save and Dyed for, and moſt certainly will
Receive into his Everlaſting Arms, when he ſhall come
again to make up his Jewels.</p>
            <p>But our Repentance muſt be made up of theſe Parts,
1. There muſt be a Senſe of Sin, 2. An Hearty Sorrow for
it, 3. A free Acknowledgement and Confeſſion of it, 4. An
utter Abhorrence and forſaking of it.</p>
            <p>1. There muſt be a Senſe of Sin, if we would Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
Repent of it. That it is Abominable, the Bratt of
the Devil, that that God Hates, the thing that he never
can or will Endure to behold with the leaſt Approbation.</p>
            <p>That it really grieves the bleſſed Spirit, that it Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifies
the Lord of Life afreſh, and puts Him to an open
Shame; and that it made Him, <hi>who is the ſame Yeſterday,
to Day, and for ever,</hi> to alter his Decrees concerning Man,
and Cancel that Covenant of Uninterrupted Happineſs.</p>
            <p>Of ſo Miſchievous Nature it is, that it turn'd Angels
into Devils, Men into Beaſts; and Tumbled them down
from <hi>Life</hi> to the <hi>Grave,</hi> from a <hi>Throne</hi> to a <hi>Priſon,</hi> from
<hi>Heaven,</hi> and a Title to never-ceaſing Joys, to <hi>Hell,</hi> and the
aſſurance of Eternal Torments. This is Sin, and thus we
muſt acknowledge it to be exceeding Sinful. And then,</p>
            <p>2. We muſt proceed to <hi>Godly Sorrow</hi> for it. We muſt
Heartily bewail it, expreſs ſenſibly our Diſſatisfaction in,
and Diſlike of it; and that from a true Apprehenſion
of its own Vileneſs, and that moſt wretched Folly, that
betray'd us into it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:97062:13"/>
And this Sorrow muſt be not only becauſe we have
brought our ſelves into great Danger, contracted Guilt,
and wrought our own Ruin: But becauſe alſo we have
dealt ſo Unkindly and Ungratefully, with ſo good a
God: Becauſe we have provoked ſo Compaſſionate a
Father, ſlighted ſo Gracious a Redeemer, and quench'd
the Motions of, and grieved ſo Bleſſed a Sanctifier. Thus
ſhould we abound in Holy Sorrow, with reſpect both
to our God and our ſelves; for our God, that we have
thus Baſely, Treacherouſly, and Ungratefully, done as
much as in us lay, to the very Dethroning of Him; as
well as for our ſelves, whom this filthy Sin has ſunk into
ſo wretched a Condition.</p>
            <p>3. If we would perfect our Repentance, we muſt truly
acknowledge and confeſs our Sins, not Hide them, not
Palliate and Excuſe them, not Stifle and Endeavour to
put them out of our Minds, but to own them, and
our ſelves for Sinners.</p>
            <p>When ever we deſire to enter the Temple, when ever
we prepare to return to our Fathers Houſe, and there
hope to be Receiv'd and Wellcom'd, we cannot do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
then take to our ſelves the Words of the old repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Prodigal, and ſay, <hi>Father I have ſinned againſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called
Thy Son,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 21.</p>
            <p>Thus freely ſhould we expoſe our Vileneſs, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
our Tranſgreſſions, and that we have worthily
deſerv'd Gods Wrath; that we have added Sin to Sin,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97062:13"/>
Treaſured our Vices, and Aggravated them with the
moſt heightening Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>And who knows then, but at our Meeting, as the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Father in the Goſpel receiv'd his Rebellious Son,
ſo our Heavenly Father will receive us alſo, forgive us,
and Enthrone us in his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And here that I be not Miſunderſtood, let me hint
to you the Excellency of our Church, in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
We are not obliged to an exact Diſcovery of every
Secret of our Hearts to Men of Cunning and Art, and
yet of like Paſſions with our ſelves; which is the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
management of other Churches and Sects; by
which the poor People are lyable to be Ruin'd on Earth,
their Secrets being extorted, and they thereby expoſed
to the ſhock and prey of Cruel and Unreaſonable Men.
But our Church requires General Confeſſions only, ſuch
as ſhe has provided; as <hi>We have Erred and Strayed from
thy ways like loſt Sheep, we have followed two much the
Devices and Deſires of our own Hearts, we have offended
againſt thy Holy Laws,</hi> &amp;c. Save in the matter of
Scruples; and then alſo it is order'd with that Eaſe and
Security for the quieting of the Conſcience, and relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the troubled Mind, as to Demonſtrate the Divinity
of the Conſtitution, and that Holy Spirit which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
the Directions.</p>
            <p>All this I have ſaid is of our Church and Publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions;
but for our Private ones, thoſe in our Cloſets, we
muſt be ſure there to ranſack every corner of our Hearts,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97062:14"/>
to Confeſs and Bewail every Particular of our Sins, to
our God; ſo he that <hi>ſeeth, he that heareth in Secret, will
reward openly;</hi> we ſhall not fail then of Pardon, and
Forgiveneſs, if we add that that's next to be Conſider'd
to make up our Repentance, and that is,</p>
            <p>4. A <hi>Forſaking of all our Sins,</hi> and an utter abhorrence
of them for the future. <hi>He that Confeſſeth and Forſaketh,
it is that ſhall find Mercy.</hi> Would we then perfect our
Repentance, and be truly Welcome to our Lord and
Saviour in His Houſe and Family? Thus we muſt do;
<hi>Confeſs,</hi> and <hi>Forſake;</hi> own our former Follies, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
upon a new and better Life; promiſe to our Lord
more Faithful Obedience, and then take Care to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it; reſign up our ſelves intirely to the Will of God,
and then indeavour to walk with him all the Days
of our Lives.</p>
            <p>So ſhall we be truly Wellcome to our Lord now in this
Sacrament, and ever afterwards in his Houſe; ſo ſhall
we Enjoy the Comfortable Preſence of the bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
here, and even the Lord of Life in that Spiritual
Banquet, the other Sacrament. And when theſe Earthly
Services and Mercies ſhall fail us, we ſhall receive Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Comforts, be poſſeſt of Bleſſings Unſpeakable and
full of Glory; ſo ſhall none of our former ſinful Actions
ever riſe againſt us, to Accuſe or Condemn us, or our
Conſciences to affright us; but in Peace and Quietneſs, in a
Sedate and Calm Compoſure of Spirit, we ſhall at laſt
reſign our Souls into the hands of God, <hi>in ſure and certain
hope of a joyful Reſurrection.</hi> I am now in the</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:97062:14"/>
4. Place to conſider the ſeveral Duties we are Enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in by our Baptiſm; and theſe are exactly ſet down
in our Catechiſm; when we Vow and Promiſe, 1. <hi>To Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the Devil and all his Works, the Pomps and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of this wicked World, with all the Sinful Luſts
of the Fleſh.</hi> This Vow is of three parts: The 1. To Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the Devil and all his Works. By this the Church
generally underſtands Renouncing of all falſe Gods, and
falſe Worſhip.</p>
            <p>The World at the coming of our Saviour, was full of
Idolatry; and therefore it was very proper that all thoſe
that were willing to engage in, and be happy by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
of the true Religion, ſhould be obliged to Renounce
abſolutely all the falſe: And this not only in Tongue,
but in Heart alſo; not only in Profeſſion, but in Action.</p>
            <p>As we are not to believe in, &amp; pay Devotion to an Idol;
ſo, nor are we to act any of thoſe bruitiſh Villanies which
took up the Lives of thoſe Idolatrous Heathens. As
we are not to conſult Witches and Devils, ſo, nor muſt
we have ſuch low and mean apprehenſions of God and
His wiſe Providence, as to ſink our Hearts, and ſuffer
them to be betrayed to any baſe and unlawful Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances:
And therefore more eſpecially by the <hi>Works</hi> of
the <hi>Devil</hi> here, was meant thoſe abominable <hi>Villanies</hi>
(the Apoſtle ſays) <hi>not to be Named among Chriſtians;</hi>
which was the uſual practiſe of thoſe <hi>Heathen Idolators;</hi>
and for which the greateſt of Gods Judgments have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
been brought upon the Earth; <hi>even fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:97062:15"/>
upon particular Cities, famous for thoſe Brutalities;
Nay, even that <hi>Deluge</hi> of Water upon the whole Earth.</p>
            <p>But, beſides thoſe, there are others that may proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be called the <hi>Works</hi> of the <hi>Devil;</hi> being ſuch he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
in, and is very diligent in Tempting us to. Amongſt
theſe is <hi>Pride,</hi> that Uſurping and Ambitious Deſire that
made the firſt <hi>Devil,</hi> and Dethroned him from an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
in <hi>Heaven,</hi> to the infernal <hi>Abyſs</hi> of <hi>Hell;</hi> ſuch alſo
is <hi>Lying;</hi> for he is called a <hi>Lyar, and the Father of it,</hi>
St. <hi>John</hi> 8. 44. Such alſo is <hi>Slandering,</hi> for he is famouſly
alſo called the <hi>Accuſer of the Brethren;</hi> ſuch alſo, is <hi>Malice</hi>
and <hi>Envy, being hateful, and hating one another.</hi> Theſe are
the proper Practiſes of him, whom the Scripture calls a
<hi>Murderer from the Beginning:</hi> And ſuch alſo, is all <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
Contentedneſs and Delight in Sin, and Encouraging
and Tempting</hi> others to commit it; all theſe are truly
and properly called the <hi>Works</hi> of the <hi>Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond part of the <hi>Vow</hi> is, <hi>To Renounce the Pomps
and Vanities of this wicked World.</hi> By theſe were meant
formerly ſome Villanous and Unlawful <hi>Sports</hi> of the
<hi>Heathens,</hi> which we now (thanks be to God) know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of; and as it reſpects us, may be underſtood by
them moſtly, all undue and ſinful Compliances with any
of the things of the World; whether they be <hi>Riches,</hi>
or <hi>Pleaſures,</hi> or <hi>Honours;</hi> whether it be <hi>Meat,</hi> or <hi>Drink,</hi>
or <hi>Apparel;</hi> whether it be <hi>Reſt,</hi> or <hi>Sport,</hi> or <hi>Imployment;</hi>
or indeed any inordinate Enjoyment of any of theſe
Earthly things. Now many of all theſe things, as they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97062:15"/>
are <hi>Bleſſings,</hi> when well uſed; ſo when abuſed, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>Curſes, Pomps</hi> and <hi>Vanities</hi> of this World, and
to be Renounced.</p>
            <p>The third part of the <hi>Vow,</hi> is to <hi>Renounce all the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Luſts of the Fleſh;</hi> that is, all <hi>Vile Affections,</hi> and
<hi>Beaſtly Humours,</hi> and <hi>Greedy Cravings;</hi> the Conquering
of which is true <hi>Self Denyal,</hi> and <hi>Mortification,</hi> the great
Duty of the approaching Seaſon; which I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to inculcate to you, and which you will have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
opportunities of improving in the knowledge of, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<hi>Lent.</hi> And ſo I come to the</p>
            <p>Second part of the <hi>Vow</hi> and <hi>Promiſe,</hi> which is, <hi>To
Believe all the Articles of our Chriſtian Faith:</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
not only in the being rightly inform'd in the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi>
of our <hi>Faith;</hi> in <hi>Learning, Endeavouring</hi> to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,</hi>
and giving full <hi>Conſent</hi> unto them; but (which
perfects and compleats our Faith) in <hi>Living accordingly,</hi>
in <hi>doing</hi> thoſe things that will prove and well Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
our Faith. And particularly, to explain this in
the Apoſtles <hi>Creed;</hi> When I ſay, <hi>I Believe in God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Almighty;</hi> I muſt Honour and Reverence Him, as my
<hi>God;</hi> Love and Obey Him, as a tender <hi>Father;</hi> Fear and
Own Him, as he is <hi>Almighty: Maker off Heaven and Earth;</hi>
Here I muſt attribute the Glory of all the Works of the
Creation to Him; admire his great Love in Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
Being to us and all his Creatures; give him only
the Honour and Glory of Preſerving and Bleſſing us;
and Love, Admire, and Praiſe his Univerſal Providence
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97062:16"/>
over the World. At the ſame rate we muſt reduce to
Practiſe, all the reſt of the <hi>Articles</hi> of our <hi>Faith;</hi> and
ſo doing is truly <hi>Believing</hi> of them. The third part of
our <hi>Vow</hi> and Obligation in <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> is, That we <hi>Keep Gods
Holy Will and Commands, and walk in the ſame, all the
Days of our Lives.</hi> By which is meant, that we will
make it our Buſineſs, as much as in us lies, to walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Direction of Gods ways; that we will
uſe our beſt Endeavours to work his Righteouſneſs, and
apply our ſelves with all Diligence and Care to the
diſcharge of all the ſeveral Duties of our Lives.</p>
            <p>That we will not Practiſe Holineſs by <hi>Fits</hi> and <hi>Starts</hi>
only; allow time for Devotions and Holy Duties, when
we have nothing elſe to do; as is too much the Practiſe
of ſome. But that our whole Life ſhall be one continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Act of Honeſty and Piety; and we always will En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to grow in <hi>Grace,</hi> and in the <hi>Knowledge and
Love of our Saviour, Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> that we will keep true
and undaunted to the end, and <hi>Fight our good Fight,</hi> and
<hi>Finiſh our Courſe,</hi> and <hi>keep the Faith;</hi> knowing that all this
<hi>Labour will not be in Vain,</hi> but that we ſhall receive an
Ample and moſt Glorious Reward in the <hi>Final and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Salvation of our Immortal Souls.</hi> And this leads to the</p>
            <p>Laſt particular, the Conſideration of thoſe glorious <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits</hi>
of <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> By this it is that we aſſure our <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
we enter into <hi>Covenant</hi> with the <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi>
who has engaged himſelf (we performing our parts) to
make us eaſie and happy here, and glorious hereafter;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97062:16"/>
to afford us his Grace and Favour, his Mercy and Love in
this Life; then to receive us to himſelf, to partake of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Glory in the Life to come. By this we become <hi>Sons
of God, Heirs of Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Members of Chriſt.</hi> By this
we have our <hi>Pardon Sealed,</hi> and it is at our own Will
and Pleaſure afterwards, whether we will be happy or
not, whether we will be <hi>Saved</hi> or <hi>Ruined.</hi> By this we
have the Favour and Grace of God <hi>Aſcertain'd;</hi> and in
this, we enter upon all thoſe Glorious Fruits of our <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Lords Death</hi> and <hi>Paſſion,</hi> of his Glorious <hi>Reſurrection</hi>
and <hi>Aſcenſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And who can eſteem theſe poor and mean things?
Who, of any Senſe and Thought, can count them Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent?
Who, but muſt highly Value, and with all his
Powers attempt to obtain them?</p>
            <p>Happy moſt certainly are all they, who are thought
worthy of them; Happy indeed all we who are capable
of them; who by the Care of our Parents, in our Early
Adoption and good Education, may be properly ſaid
to be Born Heirs to them.</p>
            <p>Happy our Nation that Enjoys the beſt of Churches,
and happy all thoſe People who are brought up in the
moſt Excellent <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Happy all we who had Chriſtian and Conſcientious
<hi>Parents,</hi> and were early Inſtructed in theſe Noble Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
thrice happy we, who have ſo great, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Encouragements to our Duty, and may perceive ſo
much Eaſe and Pleaſure, ſo much Joy and Satisfaction, in
the Diſcharge of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:97062:17"/>
Happy are all they, who ſquare their Lives according
to theſe Rules, and makes it their Buſineſs to follow
the <hi>Captain</hi> of their <hi>Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Happy all they, who when denied and refuſed theſe
Bleſſedneſſes by the Misfortune of <hi>Education,</hi> or the Force
and Violence of Commanding <hi>Relations,</hi> do at laſt by
the Grace of God, and the Power of his Righteouſneſs
in their Hearts; or by the Conviction of their own Sins,
and Miſery in the want of a Saviour, as the <hi>Men of Iſrael</hi>
in the Text, and <hi>theſe Perſons</hi> here preſent, do Heartily
deſire, and in this Sacrament, eſpouſe <hi>Jeſus Chriſt and
Him Crucifyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Happy all thoſe, who omit no opportunities of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all this Happineſs, Improving all theſe Glorious Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges:
<hi>Happy indeed, the People that are in ſuch a Caſe;</hi>
truly <hi>Bleſſed all they, who</hi> thus <hi>have the Lord for their God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have ſtill the <hi>Application</hi> to preſs to us all on theſe
two Accounts, both as we have obtained, and as we
have very Early and Long-ago obtained this Happineſs.</p>
            <p>To you firſt, who now have obtained this Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
this Chriſtian Fraternity; as you are now admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the Church of God, and made Members of
Chriſt, ſuffer this Word of Advice.</p>
            <p>You ſee how Glorious is your Imployment, how great the Reward of it;
how Sacred the Profeſſion is which you have now undertaken, how ſerious
and earneſt are all the Rules and Laws of it. You ſee how good is your
ſecurity of reward from your Heavenly Father; how neceſſary therefore is
it for you not to be behind-hand, but to make good your part. You ſee that
all the conditions are abſolutely in Favour of you, and that if you keep
faithful to the end, you'll obtain ſuch glory as does paſs all underſtanding.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97062:17"/>
You ſee that you have enter'd upon an Holy Employment, a Serious
and Sacred Converſation; you ſee what you have now Promiſed and
Engaged, even to put off and Renounce your former Natural Habits,
and Sinful Inclinations. Nay, you Solemnly have Vowed before God
and good Witneſſes, a great Number of Chriſtians in this Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that you would do your beſt ſo to do, following the Commands of
God, and walking from henceforth in Newneſs of Life. Laſtly, you ſee
what you loſe, if you forfeit this your Truſt, and Break your Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and what you'll gain: You loſe then no leſs than God, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
Joys <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſpeakable and full of Glory; and you'll gain only Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments,
and Vexations, Torments and Trouble, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>neaſineſs and the
Gripes of Conſcience, while you're on Earth; and afterwards anguiſh
of Soul, Judgment with Deſpair, all the Treaſures of Hell, even
Eternal Deſolations.</p>
            <p>Be aſſured then that this is no Jeſt, 'tis no leſs than your Intereſt,
than your beſt Intereſt, the Intereſt of your Souls: And you will find
that your Duty will require your utmoſt Care. Baptiſm indeed begins
an Happy Life, but yet a Life not free from Trouble and Temptation;
the Devil is always very buſie with New-beginners; as ſoon as our
Lord himſelf was Baptiz'd, he had the Impudence to Attack and Tempt
Him: But he who overcame him, will alſo guard you, if you keep
true to him, and will take Care that you ſhall not be Tempted, above
what in will Enable you to bear; and God grant that you may ſo
Conſider all theſe things, as to anſwer the great end of this your Noble
and ſo Glorious Call.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, To all us who have been ſo long Engaged in this mighty
<hi>Covenant,</hi> let one Word be added. We were early admitted into the
<hi>Church,</hi> with all the Eaſe and Satisfaction Imaginable; with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of <hi>Friends,</hi> the Joy of <hi>Neighbours,</hi> the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Relations,</hi>
and all manner of Encouragement: We have frequently repeated this
Holy <hi>Contract,</hi> Solemnly renewed it in the other <hi>Sacrament,</hi> that
of our Dear Lords Bleſſed <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us all remember, and moſt earneſtly Conſider the Sacredneſs of
our <hi>Obligation,</hi> the neceſſity of our <hi>Obedience,</hi> and the wonderful
Indulgence of our <hi>Lord and Maſter;</hi> who, tho' we have been ſo long
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97062:18"/>
               <hi>Bound,</hi> and frequently have forfeited our Condition of the <hi>Contract,</hi>
and added many great, Voluntary, Obſtinate, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngrateful Violations
of that moſt Holy <hi>Covenant,</hi> yet is pleaſed not to take the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of us, but rather <hi>Forgive</hi> us, and wait ſtill for us, is ſtill open and
ready to receive us, willing and deſirous to be <hi>Fully Reconciled to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore we ſee the Reaſon for that Fatherly admonition we
lately received from our <hi>Right Reverend</hi> careful <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> that
that holy Sacrament be adminiſtred here in <hi>Gods</hi> own Houſe, at the
place and times appointed by the Church; not only to keep up the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of that <hi>Holy Sacrament of our Lord,</hi> of late ſunk to a moſt
dreadful Diſeſteem by many; but alſo, that we our ſelves might there
be Reminded of our own <hi>Promiſes,</hi> our own former <hi>Vows</hi> and <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,</hi>
and brought thereby to a ſpeedier Examination how we have
