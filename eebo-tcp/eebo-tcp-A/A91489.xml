            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

as it is of a private man, becauſe a private man's voice

of the Crown and Realm of France, according to the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

not unto <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> now our King; but yet the very ſame
Laws which do give unto you this right of Succeſſion, do

them by thoſe Forrein Nations, of whom he is diſcended,
with whom he is allyed, as the Scots, French, Danes, and
uncivil Iriſh, which will prove intolerable to the Engliſh.
4. The King, both for his own ſafety, and for the love he
beareth to his own Nation, will advance them, and plant
them about him in chief Places of credit; which muſt needs
breed Emulations and Controverſies between them and the
Engliſh: Then muſt he of Force ſecretly begin to favor and

hee was a man, and <hi>Margaret</hi> but a woman (though ſhee

and ſhee but of the half: In which regard hee was to bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,

<hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gant,</hi> which were many; as his right gotten by arms,
upon the evil government of the former King; his Election
by Parlament, and Coronation by the Realm, &amp;c. (ſee for

fit to procure affections; and that by her marriage ſhe
may joyn ſome other title with her own, and therby friends.
Againſt her, her being nothing at all Allied with the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of England; her Title as doubtful as the reſt, if not
more (<hi>S.</hi> 56.) Her Religion can be no great motive either
for, or againſt her: for by all likelihood it is as tender yet,
green and flaxible, as is her age, and ſex.</p>

Titles examined before, (<hi>Cap.</hi> 6.) Their difference in mean
and Kindred is great: For <hi>Derbie</hi> far exceedeth the other in
both: For the Kindred of Hertford are but few, his father
being the firſt raiſer of his Houſe: But Derbie hath, beſides
the Stanleys (which are many, and of good power) the
Lords Sturton, Monteagle, Morley, Dacres of the North,
the Earle of Cumberland, ſome of the Arundels, Poynes
of Gloceſter, and many others; beſides Lancaſter, Cheſhire,

Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> living; beſides he was like to have the whole

advanced <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. two ſeveral times) by which means, and by all
the forces and affection of the Puritan, and much of the
