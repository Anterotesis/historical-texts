            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>He hath often affirmed
<pb facs="tcp:48538:3"/>
that in framing them, he used no greater study or application, than what proceeded from a flowing Vein, summoned by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity for quick dispatch; nor expected other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation then what is due for his blind obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Laws of the Accademy: acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that things done by chance rarely succeed with praise: That the Painters Temerity and

               <p>The amorous poyson issuing from a fair womans Eyes, deprives the lover of his life, and would not we have that lovers complexion black, that is thus killed by poyson? Should not the signes of his death be imprinted on his face.</p>
               <p>Again, Love is an amorous feaver, which corrupting the noblest blood, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses his death. Therefore he that loves, dying through the infection of that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilential feaver, cannot properly have any other colour on his face but Black.</p>
               <p>The lover is oblig'd to improve his Ladies honor, but what greater honor,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48538:9"/>
can the lover do his Lady, then to serve as a shaddow or foyl to set forth her beauty with the greater luster? The charms of beauty are never discern'd so well, as by the inequality of such oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions: the snow never seems so pure and rarely white, as when it falls upon the blackest soyle.</p>
               <p>The affections of the heart are cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ractred, and copied in the face: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the heart be in a flame, the face must needs bear the signs of it, and what greater tokens can a lover give, that he nourishes a fire within his brest, then by showing the coales and sooty smoak up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his face.</p>
               <p>The face can never express its grief for the sick heart, so well as by cloathing it self in such a mourning habit; Nor can the beloved give any credit to his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, unless she see him cloud his face with sorrow, grieving for his lost heart, and liberty.</p>
               <p>Who can deny, but such a face must needs become an <hi>Ethiope,</hi> which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually exposed so neer the rayes of two most ardent suns.</p>

               <p>That lover which does not cloath his face with black, detracts from the merits of his Mistriss, as if the beams that da<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The lovers face ought to appear in such a manner, as is most likely to move his Ladies Eye to pitty; and what co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is more likely to obtain that pitty, than black and mourning weeds, which death it self doth mingle with its hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours?</p>
               <p>The lover ought to wear upon his face, the signs of what he ever most desires: and what should a lover more desire, either to receive, or steal his amorous enjoyments, than a dark midmight, whereof this black is a good Simbol on his face.</p>
               <p>The lovers face ought to be black, thereby to show his Lady the secrecy of his affections, as having hid them from the Eyes, and knowledg of the world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid'st that darkness; or else to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate his constancy, which like the black receives no alteration, nor cannot mask
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48538:10"/>
it self under any new appearance, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther colours do.</p>
               <p>The lover ought to seek all advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages for his beloved, and therefore hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a black face, it will preserve her sight: Nor does the black dissipate or segregate those purer Atomes and lively spirits issuing from her eyes.</p>

               <p>Black is a sign of an indefatigable and robust strength, ever much desired by the beloved, because they presuppose a great heat in that brest, which hath even cann'd, and scorch'd the very face.</p>
               <p>And then tis likewise a sign of a great humility; that even the very beauty of the face, is retreated from thence into the heart, in honor and reverence of her presence.</p>
               <p>By the Frontispiece we come to a great knowledge of the work, by this Porch we may give a guess of the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick: and how can we then describe the amorous Hell in a heart, but by the funest horrors of a black face?</p>
               <p>Paleness in a face, is not alwayes a sign of love. Those that betray and they that are betray'd; such as fear, or hope,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48538:11"/>
or hate, or envy, have ordinarily a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant paleness dwelling on their Cheeks. A lover cannot merit any thing by such a Colour, which may proceed from so may different causes, hardly known by the lover himself.</p>
               <p>Other more brisk and lively colours cannot signifie love, a lovers soul is too much oppressed to leave such signs of joy upon the face. The face does first of all declare the passions of the soul, and is the truest Index of the heart: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to conclude, I do believe, there is no colour that can so well befit a lovers face, as black alone.</p>

               <p>But it may be objected that it does not conclude that Silence is the true Father of Love, because <hi>Venus</hi> has had some amorous league and interest with it; since unchaste women at all times, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning themselves to the wanton em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of any one, cannot themselves easily know the right Father of their Issues, unless somtimes it may be guessed by the resemblance which it bears with the true Parent.</p>

Those that do not dread, and hate its deafning roarings, must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ignorant of its power and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or lodg a heart of brass within them, when it murmurs softly tis treacherous and deceitful; and if it loudly roare then tis infinitely perilous.

without offending the sight. Then who does not delight in't, and love it, who does not praise and admire it? By this therefore appears, that love is the child of Silence.</p>
               <p>Wherefore is the Musick and Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Sphear's so much celebrated and lov'd, but because tis so silent to our ears; which Silence alone does create and beget, our venerations and love towards it.</p>

Briefly it is the decree of Heaven that all things should Tyrannize over that beauty, which can alone Tyrannize over the Souls of those, that in all other things do command the whole universe. How ever there is nothing, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which does so much prejudice the Beauty of a Face, as Chastity.

Chastity will have no other associate then it self, tis a Melancholly Devil that still bolts up it self from all others in a solitary retiredness; and fears the very whispering of the winds, and the muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of its own thoughts. Thus Beauty is prejudiced by it, making it loose the attributes of divine, and good by not communicating its glory, and sweetness unto others. Strickt Chastity will not permit a Lady to consult with her own Looking-glass, nor to adorn her self so
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48538:17"/>
as to be able to contend for the preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Beauty with others; It will not suffer her to curle her Locks into a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Labyrinth to catch her lovers; Nor add sometimes a graceful blush to her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Cheeks, to please and tempt fond gazers with that borrowed sweetness; they must not hide any little defects, or be so bold as to help natures mistakes with a skillfull curiosity; much less may they cloath the whole Face with a false (though fair) vizard of youthful spring, in their declining Autume, or robb the Graves of their rich treasures of hair, to weave a Crown for their own Heads, and Majesty; and does not this chastity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore extramly wrong, and spoile a beauty of its charms and advantages, by denying those lawful Ornaments, which only can preserve, or advance its reputation?</p>
               <p>The greatest glory of a beauty, is to be the object and delight of all Eyes, and as 'twere the soul of all hearts. That beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is poor in power and merits, which hath not the applause of every Tongue, and like a supream Intelligence, gives mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all mens hearts and affections. But if they be chast, they leese so much of their value and esteem as they want
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48538:18"/>
services and obedience; so much must they abate of their deserts, as they are destitute of obsequious servants. Thus again, does chastity appear to be a prejudice to beauty; robbing them of so many vota<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ies, so great applauses, and daily adorations. It being only a Placonical fancy to think, that lovers can be satisfied and pleased with their Mistrisses chastity; and not have any further aime in their Services.</p>
               <p>The eyes are the perfection of the faces beauty, and that with reason, because they are composed all of light, and for no other cause were they seated under the brows; but to demonstrate, that they ought to wear those arches in tryumph of their beauty. Now chastity makes them bend, and cast down their sight and looks, having, according to <hi>Philostratus</hi> no other nest, or residence to shelter it self under, but the Eye-lids. See then how chastity deprives beauty of its chiefest Ornament hiding its most illustrious perfections, and with some reason we may think that beauty but a dead one, which hath already lost its Eyes and sight.</p>

               <p>If a chast beauty, then will secure it self from such a puissant enemy, she must of necessity put on Armour.

Now consider what a prejudice and trouble this must be to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate beauties. They must be constrained
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48538:19"/>
to sinke under the weight of heavy Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and bury the sweetness of their lovely beauty, within an Iron prison: Unhappy beauty, which for its chastity, must ever stand upon a watchful guard, and enjoy no other content, or receive any other reward, then its own fear, and toyle.</p>
               <p>Therefore all Authors conclude that <note n="a" place="bottom">Loc. Cit. Juvenal Latis. X. <hi>Ovid</hi> Lib. 8. Amor.

               <p>And therefore wise antiquity, will have <hi>Venus,</hi> who is the fairest of all the Goddesses, to be the most wanton and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chast, to demonstrate, that beauty can receive no greater prejudice than what proceeds from Chastity.</p>

               <p>And truely, what greater favour can a lover receive, since the foot is a guide to the head, the instrument of motion, an argument of the affections of the soul, and of the defects of the body, the supporter and base of a little world.</p>

                  <hi>Egyptians</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a fixed constancy and duration.</p>
               <p>Some others by the foot did use to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present a slave, or Servant, and indeed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48538:20"/>
the feet may with reason be called the slaves and servants of the body, because they are ever employed to support, and carry up and down, like slavish Potters, the whole burden of all other members. My Mistriss therefore being willing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain me for her servant, vouchsafed to tread on my foot, it being the custome of the ancient Conquerors to tread on the feet of their Prisoners, to shew them their subjection.</p>
               <p>The foot according to <note n="a" place="bottom">Loc. Cit.</note>

               <p>The foot as <hi>Aristotle</hi>

qualities the aire does produce in them. Therefore such a Lady could not favor me more eminently then to shew by trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on my foot, that my affection had inflam'd her, even the coldest parts, and farthest extremities from the heart, which by consequence, are most frozen.</p>
               <p>The ancients were wont to make signs with their feet, when they adherr'd to any mans desires, or opinions, and from thence comes that Proverb. <hi>Pedibus in Sententia discedere.</hi> Now what greater honor could I receive or desire, then to be ascertain'd of the Ladies affection, Since by her foot she gave a sign of her compliance with my affection, and testified her approbation of my service.</p>
               <p>The refusal of any one to let us touch their feet, is an argument of pride.</p>

               <p>In fine, I cannot but be proud of the honor my Lady did me, shewing she so much esteemed me by treading on my foot, that doubting least I should have quitted her affection, she by that means seemed to constrain me to abide here for ever, and who would not think it was a great honor to me, that she should let me feel her weight.</p>

                  <hi>V.</hi> Whether the Rose do presage Felicity, or Infelicity to a Lover.</head>
               <p>I Should now (cloathing the senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of my Soul, with the beauty and ornaments of handsome words) bless and thank that hand, which being Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal of its favours, hath vouchsafed to bestow a Rose on me, <hi>the Queen of Flowers;</hi> (though its purple did not claime that just preheminence) such gifts are common, which oblige us but to common expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. My tongue has not so much sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or sufficiency as to satisfie these ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations which my heart is bound to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg; and I am the less capable to do it, because the late learned discourser
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48538:22"/>
of dreames, has so possessed, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med my intellects, that I can only won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the height of his inimitable Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that made it.</p>
               <p>And then if I should say, it has the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency above all Flowers and for that cause perhaps it wears the Regal Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: that if Gardens were Heavens, the Rose would be the Sun in those Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens that it shuts it self up with the day; because it fears to be in the obscurity, or blasted by the malignity, and treachery of the night: that tis the Image and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect mirror of Princes bearing in its self, both the rewards, and punishment, that to beautifie it self, it robbed <hi>Venus</hi> of her blood, and the Gods of their <hi>Nector;</hi> that 'tis the glory of the spring, a miracle of Nature: and an excess of the benignity, and bounty of heaven; all these notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing would be but poor conceits of a mendicated Eloquence either blazed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready a thousand times, by the common breath of Fame, or infinitely beneath the just encommiums it deserves and the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of its merits.</p>
               <p>The Rose it self, is a praise to its own self, and for no other reason does its leaves sproute forth in the forms of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48538:23"/>
tongues, but to declare that it self is only worthy to proclaime and publish its own just praises: and having not the benefit of speech, though the Proverb says, that <hi>Roses speaks,</hi> yet it expresses it self suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently by its perfumed breath.</p>
               <p>But how much the more worthy the Rose is amongst all other Flowers, so much the more incertainty does it breed in this question, whether it can presage happiness, or infelicity to Lovers.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Etymologie</hi> of the name Rose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Riso,</hi> promises joy to my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but as it may possibly come from the <hi>verbe Roderam</hi> it threatens me with the continual knowings, and languishing of my Soul by concupiscence.</p>
               <p>The sanguine Colour in the Rose prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosticates the blushes of my Cheeks, if I should give my soul the liberty to doate and admire too much the beauties of any Face. But it may also presage, that I shall love a beauty so singular and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that it shall force each one to blush, that shall but dare to contend with her for the priority of beauty.</p>
               <p>I might fear least the bloody colour of the Rose should predict my Martyrdome for Love. But on the other hand, I am
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48538:23"/>
assured that 'tis a signe of felicity, and grandeur, it being the colour which most great Monarchs use for their chief Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The Multiplicity of the Roses leaves, may seem to point out her avarice, whom I shall love as if she would pretend to have many rich gifts, and but yet I know she cannot so much covet gifts and rich pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, who like the Rose shall have already a Crown of Gold in her own bosome.</p>
               <p>The many Rose leaves, which resemble tongues, does tell me, that a thousand several tongues, shall proclaime my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py love; Nevertheless I remember, that the Rose is the <hi>Hieroglyphick</hi> of silence, and was therefore by the Grecians conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated unto <hi>Harpocrates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The prickle joyned to the Rose, do menace me with many sharp troubles, which may accrue from my affections: yet this again secures me, that as the Rose does flourish and tryomph amidst those many thorns; so I in despight of all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position and difficulty, shall yet attain the fruition of my desires.</p>
               <p>The prickles also may portend danger, and mortal wounds. But the leaves on the other part do promise a perfect cure,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48538:24"/>
being very effectual to stanch the blood, and heal the wound.</p>
               <p>Again the Prickles may intimate, that I shall be assaulted, by many Rivals; but <hi>Homer</hi> tels us, that <hi>Venus</hi> anointed the body of <hi>Hector</hi> with Oyl of Roses, to preserve him from the bytings of madd Dogs.</p>
               <p>The green at the extremities of the Rose leaves, are called Nails of Fingers by <hi>Dioscorides,</hi> which seem to declare, that if I will enjoy my desires, I must steal that happiness; but on the contrary I am pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised the free gift of it. The Rose being the Simbole of kindness freely imparting its ravishing odours to every one.</p>
               <p>The Rose receives its nourishment and perfume from the Rain, and morning dews, which makes me fear it prophesies that my affection, and amours must be fed with the daily aliment of my tears: on the other side, my hopes are flattered by this consideration, that as water does easily make the Rose to spring and bloom, so my tears shall soon make me obtaine the sweets of my desires.</p>
               <p>I fear some infelicity in my Love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I know the Rose yeilds poyson to the Spider; but then the pretty <hi>Bee</hi> does

comfort me again, who from the self same Rose extracts the sweetest Honey.</p>
               <p>From the frail beauty of the Rose, which begins to wither, and decay as soon as it is born; I might raise a doubt of the frailty, and inconstancy of my love; but that I know they do no truly Love, who do not continue to Love even after death, as the Rose though dead, and dry preserves a pleasing sweetness, and was perhaps for this cause, by the <hi>Ancients</hi> strewed upon their kindreds Graves.</p>
               <p>It might be guessed, that my Love should not be true, and faithful to me alone; because the Rose is a flower, that is, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all; did not I know on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that a Rose if handled or touched by many, presently leeses its lustre, and native sweetness, and that its beauty and glory is its virginity.</p>
               <p>To extract the water from a Rose, it must be done either by pressure and stamping, or by the violence and heat of the fire; from whence it may be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that my choicest affections shall not obtain their wished end, but by much trouble and labor; and yet we know the Rose ever comunicates its odours and fragrancy, with freedome and liberality.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:48538:25"/>The Rose delights, attracts, and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly courts every one that beholds or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches it, which may inferre that she may have but little honesty, whom I shall adore; that treasure being unsecure, which lies within the reach of every covetous hand, as seeming to invite and tempt any fond Passenger; but this is my comfort, when I consider, how it is armed, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with a strong guard of prickles, for the defence of its own honor, and chastity, wherewith it bears off, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys all those little envious infects which come to soile its beauty, and innocent sweetness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>In fine, for all those other many contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties, yet nevertheless, since the Rose, if well considered, appears to be a little paradise to the Eye, honey to the taste, and a Cordial to the he<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rt, I think I may safely conclude, that it does really presage future happiness and felicity to Lovers.</p>
               <p>But whilst I have so long discoursed of the Rose, I seem to have forgot, that I make you feel the prickles, and sit on thorns, by my too Prolix harangue, which yet your noble sweetness, with an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant benignity and favour, have vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed to applaude, and approve by your

               <p>This kind of Kissing may have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, to hinder the party kissed, from withdrawing too soon at their own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; for so when they desired a long Kiss they would be sure to take good hold, as people usually doe, when they mean to drink a very deep uninterrupted draught,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48538:28"/>
in those two eared potts. Or else they meant thereby not only to please the Lips with a melting soft touch, but also to advertise the ears, of the sweet sound and smack thereof.</p>
               <p>The privation of one sence augments and encreases the perfection of another. The blind do super-abound in excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of memory, and the dumb excell in subtility, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ngenuity. Therefore who knows but they found out this mode of Kissing, that by hindring the ears of their function of hearing, the delight of tasting, and feeling might be encreased.</p>
               <p>Perhaps it might be to signifie, that they can have no eare to hear, or attend the voyce of reason, who are Kissing two Rosied tempting Lips, whose sweetest Nectar hides a Poysonous charm within them.</p>
               <p>But yet in my opinion, this way of Kissing was first used, because the Ears, are consecrated to Memory, and they would by this Invention, advertize the Ears not to loose the Memory of so delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a pleasure as was Kissing.</p>
               <p>The name of the <hi>Florentine</hi> Kiss, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded only from this, because it was more used in <hi>Florence,</hi> than any where else.

               <p>Blushing be tokens shame for our errors. <hi>Rubescunt</hi> says <hi>Alex. ab Alex. qui pudent.</hi> He that is asham'd hath erred, and shall we then believe, that, to be a good effect, which proceeds from so bad a cause?

               <p>Blushing is a reproof for some guilt, as if the bloud were sent from the heart into the face, to correct or restrain, the errors of the hand, or tongue.</p>
               <p>He that blushes cannot merit, because that act is violent, not voluntary; and even, as we cannot sin without the assent of the will, so neither can one merit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the consent of the Soul, or mind.</p>
               <p>Blushing is an affect of the Ambition of the heart, which perhaps would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press

                  <hi>Microcosme,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing marked therefore with those signs of blushes, it cannot betoken any Vertue.</p>
               <p>Blushing is nothing else, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of blood. <hi>Rubor</hi> says, <hi>Simplicius</hi>

               <p>Blushing is an imperfection, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Women, who are more imperfect and more enclined to commit errors than men, are more subject to blush.</p>
               <p>Lovers wax pale, because knowing that blushing betokens no vertue or goodness, it cannot help them to attain the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or esteem of their beloved, and indeed, who would not suspect that heart of cruelty, that wears those bloody Colours on the Face.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:48538:36"/>Wiser in this, then any other thing, are many Women who to conceale this sign of shame, paint themselves to hide their blushing that so the most curious eye may not be able to find them guilty of the least crime, or errour.</p>

not Illustrious Princes, amidst the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain opinions of these Gentlemen, what valuable decision to make.</p>
               <p>Those things being most grateful, which depend most upon the will of the beloved object, makes me decide the Question in favour of gifts; yet this Consideration suspends the sentence, because those things do most delight our Genius, which are gained with most toyle and sweat.</p>
               <p>As those delights are but ordinary, which are offered to us with a Prodigall hand, so on the other side those favours, cannot be so hugely pleasing, that must be procured by the danger of stealth.</p>
               <p>The sadness makes gifts the more wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and the impatience of our desires sweetens stealth's.</p>
               <p>Those ordinarily receive gifts only that have great merits, and stealth's are not gained but by daring souls.</p>
               <p>That which is given may be thought to be but common to others, so likewise every common Lover may ravish.</p>
               <p>They that suffer themselves to be rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, are not thought to be very wise or circumspect. They that proffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves cannot avoid the suspition of being dishonest.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:48538:47"/>Such as grant ere they are requested, undervalue themselves, those that force their Lovers to steal, are too haughty.</p>
               <p>There is nothing so sweet, as what we steal or gather our selves, yet those fruits are grately which a fair hand bestows.</p>
               <p>Love is feigned to be a Child, to teach us that gifts best please him: but he is likewise blind to shew that he will give us leave to steal.</p>
               <p>But this is the truth, however, O ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous assembly, than such a Lover is more happy that ravishes, that he that receives the fruits of Love as a gift. He is more noble, more deserving, more happy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt that loves, than he that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved: <hi>Aristotle,</hi> affirme it, because he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges the party beloved, &amp;c. <hi>Cognosci enim</hi> says <hi>Aristotle,</hi>

               <p>He either loves not or cannot love, that expects and waits for the favours of Ladies who affect a kind of violence even in vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary and delightful actions.

               <p>VVOman is the fairest and most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable object in the world, the greatest and most precious gift God has bestowed upon humanity. Because by means of her, the spirit of man is raised to contemplation, and contemplation carries our desires to the knowledg of things divine, we may say with reason therefore, that woman was bestowed upon us, for an earnest, and an essay of the blessings of heaven, and for this perhaps the Flamins loosing their wives were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48538:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of their sacred office, to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate that the womans perfection added merit to the sacrifices, and who does not see, for a woman, man forgets himself: nay becomes his own enemy, and if at any time, he fix his eyes upon a beauteous face, his body trembles, and at the same instant burns and freezes, and like those who unexpectedly beholds some divine object, is agitated, and moved with a celestial fury. Finally being recovered, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recollected their spirits, again they reverence women in their thoughts, Love them with their souls, and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that is due to a Deity, offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon the alter of a Ladies heart their victime and sacrifice.</p>
               <p>Consider therefore, in what trouble I am involved, since I must blame the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest work of God, and the greatest Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle on Earth.</p>

               <p>Woman is an imperfect Animal, an errour of nature, and a Monster of our species. If difformed she is a torment to the Eye, if beauteous, a plague to the

heart. If beloved, she becomes a Tyrant, if hated, an inveterate enemy, she knows no mean, distinguishes with no reason, and knows not that Justice hath a being. In her thoughts, she is inconstant, in her desires inordinate, and implacable in her anger. Her Love proceeds from interest, her faith from necessity, and her Chastity from fear; If she speak, she lies, when she smiles, she deceives, and if she weep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayes. Her mouth is ordinarily filled with the honey of flattery; but her breast with the poyson of envy, with her Eyes, she affascinates, with her arms inchaines, with Kisses stupifies, and with the other delights robs the intellect and reason, and transforms men into beasts. <note n="a" place="bottom">Dira quidem vis est marinorum fluctum.

               <p>The Contemplation of death is one of the first Lessons, by which wise men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake, and pretend to teach us to live well. Murder, Avarice, sensuality, and other such like kinds of Vices will hardly ever find a harbor on that soul, which is ever considering and beholding its own ruine, in the sud Looking-glass of death, and every moment in his thoughts builds its own Sepulchre. He that sleeps much associate and acquaints himself with death contemplates, and converses with him; sleeping is no other according to <hi>Cicero,</hi> than an Image of death or an interrupted death, and can we then blame those that sleep much? Dreams, if we believe <note n="a" place="bottom">Reveluntur &amp; honores &amp; ingenia per quietem pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantus, at medela produntur &amp; furta, conferunt, &amp; thesauri de ani.</note>

               <p>Tis the opinion of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> confirmed by the whole worlds experience <note n="a" place="bottom">Felices dimidia parte vita amiseris nibil distare. Arist. Eth. cap. 13.</note> that there is no equality for half the time of our lives between Kings and Slaves, since sleep makes them all equal, and renders them a like so long as they are under its drowsie Empire. And shall we blame such a one, who sleeps much, thereby to enjoy the more that equality with the greatest, and most happy persons that are on Earth? Who though he be poor when awake, yet then thinks himself as rich as <hi>Cresus</hi> himself; and if miserable, yet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by becomes equal to those whom the world stiles the darlings of Fortune?</p>

               <p>The world is a vally of Miseries, and tears. The disordinate affections of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity have made it become odious to the most understanding souls, and the most ingenious spirit. The Philosopher <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclitus</hi> said, he found on every side con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual subjects for his weeping. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then should we blame him that shall sleep much, since the more he sleeps, the more he flies from this miserable life, and removes himself the further from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felioities of the world?</p>
               <p>And though it were a defect to sleep much, yet he might well deserve an excuse that were such a sleeper, since his very life payes for the usury of that pleasure, of sleeping, because its certain that every sleep, is so much time cut of from our life.</p>
               <p>And then what sin, what vice can be more excuseable then that, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted sleeping?</p>
               <p>Sleep is a thing that's necessary, and good, because it proceeds from nature; and because 'tis the quieter and calmer of

Those are made fit by art to adorne the purity of a whiter neck, and these are reserved by nature to enrich the beauties of a Rosie cheek Then let us call them pretious, and if they be soft they may inform us thus much, that if one of those being dissolved by <hi>Cleopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> had power to force <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> to confess his heart was overcome, one of these liquified even by the hands of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture her self, with greater power shall constraine us to acknowledg that our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are vanquished.</p>
                  <p>Love the great God of War, does still invent new and various Stratagems to conquer and subdue our hearts and Souls. Sometimes he attempts to overthrow us, only with the sounds of precions metals, sometimes erects his bridg upon the base of our most instable hopes; sometimes assaults us with the sweetness of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48538:60"/>
voice; and othertimes endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours the Scalado upon the Cords of a well-tuned Instrument.</p>
                  <p>But in fine, all these potent and flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing stratagems, are nothing if compared to a fair weeping face. Many times there are such, who being stored with principles and resolutions of chastity, will repel all those assaults and tryals, though seconded and assisted with many tempting caresses and other provoking Artifices; but when he beseiges us with a sea of tears, ther's no humanity can resist him, none but such as glory in their Inhumanity; and we may well believe he will expugne that obdure soul of its strongest fortress when he comes rowling and shouring in with such torrents of over-flowing tears.</p>
                  <p>Smith's do use to besprinkle their Coales with water, which being after blown upon, do burn with the greater ardour: And Love, being a smith's son, does often use his Fathers policy: For when he is resolved to inflame a heart most, he first lets fall a soft showre of tears to moysten it, and after with deep sighs blows it into a most consuming flame.</p>
                  <p>Even the Sun, to make his Beams be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more hot and scorching, does seem
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48538:60"/>
to unite them together, and dart them through a Cloud, which is no other than rarified water, which being condens'd, desolves and drops in tears from Heaven again.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Excuse me, Sirs, if this conceit seem strange to you, that I should say, tears are the Milk, of the Eyes, and why must that be esteemed so unlikely, that those Eyes should flow with milk, which do so often bring forth Love? And if you do grant this <hi>Caprichio,</hi> give me leave to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that there is nothing more proper to nourish affection than tears, since they
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48538:61"/>
are milk, and Love is still a Child.</p>
                  <p>If any one should ask a Lover, they would return this answer, that the tears are no other, than the quintescence of the soul distilled through those Eyes, which pretend to teach us thereby, how liberal we should be of our Love to them, who do so prodigally wast their souls for us.</p>
                  <p>Others have said, that tears are extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the purest blood in the heart, which may serve us for an argument, that if the blood of <hi>Caesar</hi> dead, had power to move the souls of the Romans to a Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, much more will these living drops of the fair weepers Eyes, be able to stir up our Affections to Mutinies and Tumults. And if you say, that this might be tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, because a Tyrants, remember that beauty likewise is no other, than a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
                  <p>But to know, whether the power of tears be greater, than of singing, consider that these move by nature only, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging all by Art.</p>
                  <p>I know you will not deny, but that a spring, which casts forth pure and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring streams out of its Rocky bosome, naturally, does flatter and delight our sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48538:61"/>
more then those magnificent and state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Romane fountains, though those arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial structures have no stone in them, which is not worth a treasure.</p>
                  <p>A pure and unsophisticated beauty, how much more it does charme and captivate our hearts, than such as are made hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some only by art; your selves may judg, who have so often yeilded to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding swetness. The Poets seigned <hi>Cupid</hi> always naked, to shew us that a natural beauty naked of all false cloathing artifice does soonést tempt, insna<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Dissembling all its passions, &amp; cunningly changing it self into an hundred severall humors of mirth and sadness: and if it have any thing pleasing in it, it must be somthing only natural, and how can the soul possibly Love that singing, which glories in its bewitching fraud and vaunts that it obtains respect, and reverence only, by a sweet nothingness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:48538:62"/>To express the power of singing, sayes one, it is an inchantment; but sirs, if you will know, how much weeping prevailes above it, remember that that <hi>Armida,</hi> who otherwhile triumphed over the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Squadrons by power of her inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, was forced to make use of her tears, to add more Vigour to those very inchantments. So that the spirits and furies themselves are too weak to resist the charms of a beauteous weeper. Nor need we wonder at it, for theirs at most is but an infernal power, and the tears drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping from a handsome Face, are no less than the showers even of a clouded heaven.</p>
                  <p>Musitians themselves confess that to add more vigour to their singing, they are necessitated to make use of frequent sighs, trembling, quavers, and soft lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing strains: and what else are these, but parts of sorrow, and weeping? These they make use of, because otherwise that musi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:48538:62"/>Consider therefore the power of wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, from which even singing it self does borrow so much help.</p>
                  <p>That Ambi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ious Musitian gloried, that he had redeemed his dear <hi>Euridice</hi> from Hell, by the powerful sweetness of his voice; But let me rather say, that if he did obtain her, because he sung so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently well, perhaps he lost her so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly again, because he did not weep, sufficiently?</p>
                  <p>And what can you imagine, the heavens desires or expects from us, unless it be Love. When it so often poures down shours of tears: <hi>Pythagoras</hi> believed that the Sphears were ever making a sweet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; But I see that we often returne thanks to heaven for its weeping, but never for its imaginary musick.</p>
                  <p>Poets have sometimes commended a beauty, hid under a mourning Cypress vayle, as if the resplendant Beams of such a beauty, being concentred together, should through that obscurity, thus united, have the more power to make a speedy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest over the Soul. Now observe, Sirs, that a weeping beauty, is a beauty clad in its morning weeds, which should merit our affections the sooner, because it seems
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48538:63"/>
to put on that sad habit, to perform the obsequies for your expired liberty.</p>
                  <p>By the Law of Nature we should give credit to their affections, which can bring good witness that they Love. Now what are such tears else but testimonies of a heart, that Loves sincerely, which come to Natures tribunal attending on the Soul, to demand a Reciprocall Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aristotle</hi> says, that our tears are a kind of sweat, and if we justly merit wages for sweat and labour, who can deny the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Love to those fair Eyes, which perhaps sweat and pant, lying under the burden of an amorous affection.</p>
                  <p>Tears have such efficacy to Enamour, that I believe, the offerings of <hi>Myrrhe,</hi> and <hi>Incense</hi> are grateful and pleasing to the gods, for no other Reason, but because they are Tears, though shed by senceless trees. Those lighted Candles which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten shine upon a sacred Altar, where we implore the grace of Heaven; if you but marke it, do never burn without letting fall some drops like tears, perhaps to teach fair Eyes, that if the tears, even of inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate lights, have power to move the heavens, the drops of two such bright, and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48538:63"/>
living torches, must needs have as much influence on Men.</p>
                  <p>We do not ordinarily ascribe any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Epithets</hi> to musick, than those of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody and sweetness. But when we treat of tears, we use to call them by a more Viril name, womens arms or Weapons. Now do you guess Sirs, whether they be not potent, since they have obtained even the name of Weapons. And I believe it was for no other reason that the gods blinded <hi>Cupids</hi> Eyes; but only because if he could have added tears to the power, he hath already, there were no means left for any to resist his power and might.</p>
                  <p>Our infant age does most require the Love and tender affection of others, by reason of our own insufficiency: And yet natures Care, has provided us with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, in that age, but only our tears.</p>
                  <p>And are they so potent in our infancy, that even a child, though bound by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and reason to be under the Fathers Tuition, and Jurisdiction. Yet weeping tenderly does seem to claime, and often over swayes the parents will. Who will say then, that tears are not most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48538:64"/>
instruments, since they have so much strength though managed by a weak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful Child.</p>
                  <p>Tears are the Language of the Soul, and passions, taught us by natures self, that it might be the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by every one. Tears are the Souls Ambassadours, which being sent to declare the state of its own affections, does often lye in waite, and catch the liberty of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. They require no other Audience but our Eyes, knowing those requests are most potent, which pass through them into the heart. They express their Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage without a Tongue, and are silent with wonderful efficacy. Consider then the power of those tears, which being dumb can yet perswade, so sweetly. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it self, seems in this contest to yeild the palme of Victory to tears, since she has framed the Arches of the Eye-brows, over their Cisterns to declare that they are tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant.</p>
                  <p>Such are the Prerogatives of Tears, that they may be thought injured, when but compared to singing. Consider Sirs, that if at any time a disdainful passion, turns Gyant-like a rebel against that Heaven of beauty, they opening their Flood gates
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48538:64"/>
can quickly drown'd them in the precious Deluge. Or if at any time a stubborn soul resolve to be reconciled again to the offended Diety of Love, these Advocates present the humble Petitions, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver are rejected. If somtimes the thoughts reflect upon a wished for happiness, these officious associates, do strait way waite upon the grateful memory. If somtimes one do absent themselves from their dear Countrey, or from their dear beloved object, these alone are wont to be left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. I know not if I should say, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Companions with the soul, or as pledges for it. If sometimes the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be Gasping, and dying; nay quite dead, in the breast of disdainful Lovers, nothing but these can bring it to life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, an extinguished affection being often raised into a flame again, by being only deplorated. Now what can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared or paralelled with these tears, which have the power and vertue even to revive the dead?</p>
                  <p>But Sirs, if you please briefly in one argument to comprehend the power of tears, consider that they have not been
