            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

lyuers to repent and receaue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of the holly state of matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as some busy bodyes haue been ready to procure statutes &amp; lawes, wherby the vnchaste sole life hath beene wyth feare of the paynes of death continued, and the chast ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried lyfe in some state condemned. The cloud which hath so long blin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded the eyes of the lay sorte in thys poynt, was the opinion of hollines that they conceaued in preestes, for that they maryed not as other men dyd: and the cloud that blinded the eyes of the priestes, was the gaine that they gotte by their vnworthye estimacion.

To the entent therefore that this cloud of ignorance might bee the soner taken awaye from the eyes of the ignoraunte, and that they myght know, that it is not the vnmaryed lyfe, whyche maketh the preest better in the sight of the lord, but the wourse, if he lyue burnyng in desyres, contrary to the order in scripture commaunded, I haue set forth this little treatise, trustynge hereby to please God, and to edifye his congregation: the encrease of whose kyngdome and heuenly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye I only seeke, and to quiete the consciences of many, whiche be not yet fully instructed and resolued, in this point.

This phrase of speakynge to call matrimonye a remedy, is not only vsed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in the doctours also, who afferme wyth one consente that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonye oughte to be vsed in the Churche of God, not only for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation and increase of the worlde, but also for a remedy of incontinen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cye.<note place="margin">1.

            <p>But this geare, they thynke, wyll soone bee aunswered, graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge that the Apostles and other
<pb facs="tcp:5590:11"/>
holly bishops and priestes had wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues as I say: Mary, than will they say agayn, that neither the apostles neyther the reste of the forenamed Ecclesiasticall persons had any ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trimoniall vse of their wyfes, after the tyme of their election to their mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nistery, but did put them away, and vtterly forsooke the companye of theim, after that tyme. Well, yet than graunt they, that the apostles and other holy byshoppes and prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes had wiues, euen in the tyme of their apostleshyp and ministerye, whyche thyng I take at their han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des as wonne good grounde. For by that, haue al they granted (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che flee to this obiection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried man maie be a prieste, his wyfe being aliue. After this victory then let vs thus procede: The apostles (they saie) put awaye their wyues, after the tyme they were called to the preachynge of the Gospell. If I should aske ye, howe you proue
<pb facs="tcp:5590:11"/>
that, shoulde not the beste reason or auctoritee that ye coulde bryng for your purpose bee blynde reason or coniecture? Well, answer what ye shal thynk good, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I haue made aunswere to your former obiection. Whan ye speake of puttyng away of wyues, it is conuenient, that ye call to remembrance the laufull cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ses why a man may put awaye his wyfe, by goddis woorde: And in serchyng, ye shall fynde there, that a man can not put awaye his wyfe for any other cause,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;.</hi> 19.</note> but for adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye onely. Than is the preachynge of the Gospell no cause, why a man shoulde put away his wyfe. Muche lesse for the Apostles of Christe, whose lyfe was a rule to all the reste of the Christen congregation. I trust you bee not so shamelesse, that ye wyll chalenge the Apostles wynes to bee euyll women, for the mayntenance of your fond reason. And yet yf you woulde so dooe, it
<pb facs="tcp:5590:12"/>
maye be gathered by the Scripture that they were godlye and obedient women to their husbandes to your confusion. It is to be thought, that suche as Christe appoynted to rule the whole Congregacion, were hable to rule their wyues, their chyldren and family, or elles shuld not Christ haue obserued the same rule in chusyng of his apostles, as Paule prescribed to Timothye, in chusynge a Bysshoppe.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.</note> If they were obedient wyues to their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes (as by that scripture it may bee gathered that they were) you must nedes graunt, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles dyd not put away their wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, for if they hadde, they shoulde haue offended agaynste Goddes woorde, who chargeth man, not to put awaye his wyfe for any cause, but for adultery only.</p>
            <p>Thus then I conclude: Goddes woorde sayeth, that no man maye put awaye his wyfe excepte for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultery,
<pb facs="tcp:5590:12"/>
ergo, they dyd not put them away. Yea, and further it maye be thus proued by scripture, that they had Matrimoniall companye with theire wyues in thys wyse. The worde of God was the onely rule of the Apostles lyfe: So that what soeuer Goddes woorde commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, so they dyd: But Gods worde commaunded them, saiynge: <hi>Vir uxori debitum reddat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 17</note> 
               <hi>similiter et uxor uiro.</hi> Let the man render the dutye of a husbande to his wyfe, and the woman to her husbande.</p>
            <p>Ergo, the Apostles beyng ruled by the sayde scripture, &amp; obeiyng gods worde in this poynte, had matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial company with their wiues, and did acordyngly as scripture willeth them. For a profe wherof, the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth testify that the apostles &amp; the brothers of the Lord &amp; Cephas, caried their wiues about w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to what purpose I pray you? if it wer not for the auoidynge of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience,
<pb facs="tcp:5590:13"/>
agaynste the whyche, matrimonie is prouyded by god for remedye. If a wyfe be a trouble to theim that be prieestes (as some do alledge it) why lefte they not theyr wiues at one place remainyng, and discharged theim selues of so clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng a cariage? as by the scripture it shoulde seeme that Paule dyd. I doubt not, but that they wold haue so doone, yf the infirmitee of the fleshe had not dissuaded them to the contrary. Retourne not to your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer fantasy, sayeng as ye bee wont, that ye can not be answered, for if ye can defende without blushyng, that scripture rightly alleged, is not suf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficient to confound your coniecture whyche is directly agaynst it, than is your face so blyndelesse, that it can not blusshe.<note place="margin">A priest may not put awei his wife vnder p<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Nowe iudge you whether is beste for vs which professe Christ, to follow the Apostles of Christ, or the Romyshe Antichrist? The law of God, which wylleth byshopes and preestes to mary: or the doctrine of the deuyll, as Paule calleth it, whiche forbyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth theym maryage.

For a further profe of this my pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pose, I haue thought good here to recite certayne practises of the bys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome, which he vsed to bri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g this matter to passe.

Yet one or two of them can I not well passe ouer, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Gregorye the .vii. otherwyse named Hildebrande, whose life, who soeuer hath read, may perceiue that he was one of the chiefe authors of the wyuelesse lyfe of the clergye. Reade thoroughout the Cronicles, and I thynke you shal fynde few or none more vicious, more ambicious more cruel, more lecherous: Ye shal be forced to say, that Hildebra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d was euen a meete serpent to spit out such a poison at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dment of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,

amonge the people of God. Thistoriographers doth abu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly testify, what tumultes &amp; rufflynges he caused at Magu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stance, &amp; many other places in Fraunce and Germanye, for thestablishment of this most abhominable law against the mariage of preestes.</p>
            <p>And that ye may be the better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his practises, both in these &amp; all other christian Realmes, ye shal vnderstand, that amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther letters sent to other parties, he addressed also hys letters to Otto byshop of Constance, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he shuld forbyd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mariage through out his diocese, of suche preestes as were not yet maried, &amp; that he shuld breke &amp; loose the matrimonial knot betwene them, that were alredy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried: But Otto ꝑceauing right wel thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>godly purpose of Hildeb. neither would diuorse those preestes which wer maried, nother deny y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liberti of mariage to such preestes as wer yet

vnmaryed. The byshope of Rome therfore cursed him, and discharged his subiectes of their dutyes and obedience towardes hym, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted Otto a daye, to appeare before him at Rome in a counsell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted. In that cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel Hildebra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with thother bishops of Itali amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And none to be admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ordre of preesthode, vnlesse he fyrst were sworne, neuer to mary. This Decree of the sole life of pree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes (when the counsell was dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) was publyshed throughe oute Italy. And the byshops euery wher there, were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded bothe to obey and execute it.

And that the byshop of Rome tooke that thyng awaye from preestes, whiche both God and nature had giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to them: and that the said byshop of Rome was an heretique, &amp; thauctor of a wycked doctrine, by the sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion not of the holy gost, but of the deuyll himselfe: and moreouer that his decree was contrary to this sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng of Christ:<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:5590:20"/>
of his curse, vnlesse they compelled their preestes to obeye his Decree. So that a great numbre of bishops beyng forced by this tirannye of the byshop of Rome, applyed them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to take away the lawfull law of matrimony frome their preestes.

Tharchebyshop called a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation at Erifort, where he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, accordyng to the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Romes decree, either vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to forsake and forswere mariage, or elles to leaue of their ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ministerie: but the clergie defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them selues against Hildebran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des Decree, with scriptures, with reasons, with saiynges of counsels, with thexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of their forefathers, &amp; with a numbre of vnanswerable argumentes, wherby they proued, that the sayd Decree was nothyng to be estemed, but to be worthyly of all men reiected. And whan tharche bishop replied, saiyng, that he was compelled of the bishop of Rome, &amp; that he could do no lesse but accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishe and kepe his lawes. The cler<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gy perceauyng that there coulde be no meanes made to compasse theyr bishop, neither by disputation, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet by intreaty, they withdrew them selues a litell from the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sell,
<pb facs="tcp:5590:21"/>
as purposyng to consulte vpon the matter: some thought not good to returne into the counsell, and some other thought it was good to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, and pluck tharchebishop out of his chaire by the eares, handling hym as he had deserued, that there might a notable testimony remayn to their posterite of his worthy deth on that sorte, so that all his succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours might take ensample by hym to beware how they toke away such priuileges and libertees from the clergi. Tharchebishops spies, made reporte vnto hym of theyr intente, that went out. Then sent the arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byshope somme of his frendes to them that were without, for to coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sell them to conceaue a good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their bishop, and to wyl them quietly to retourne agayn into the counsell. They were contented and retourned. Than the archebyshop made promise, that he would do the best he coulde to change the byshop

of Romes mynde, wyllyng them in the meane season to returne to their cures. The next yere folowyng, the byshop of Magunce at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the byshop named <hi>Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ensis</hi> (who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bishop of Rome had sent in ambassage vnto hym, bothe with his letters and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement) called a counsayle at Magunce. In this counsayle he commaunded the clergie vnder the peyne of cursyng, that they wolde immediatly in that present Synode, either vtterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake their wyues, or els their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery for euer. The Clergie plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did theyr owne cause boldely: and whan they perceyued that their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere coulde not be herde, but that they should be compelled by the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie of the byshop of Rome, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beye, there was a sodayn tumulte, wherein the ruffelynge was so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lente, and with suche a force, that bothe the byshop of Romes ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour and the archebyshope were

putte in ieopardie of their lyues. The counsayl brake vp.

But he would here neither Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, neyther reason, neyther any auncient wryter sence the apostles tyme. His eares were stopped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste all reasons, whyche were contrarye to his opinyon: he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vp his thunderboltes of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synges and excommunications v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon all theym that woulde not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beye this sayenge of his: we wyll, charge, and straytely commaunde you. He wente foorthe on lyke hym selfe, withoute all feare of God, withoute all reuerence to the holly Scriptures, as a horne woode beaste, for the maynte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce of his dyuelyshe Decree,

            <p>The lyke practyse to this that was vsed in Italye Fraunce and Germanye, hath been vsed also in Englande by the bysshops at sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drye tymes, but namely in kynge Edgars dayes, thorough the sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion of the bysshoppes, Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston, Ethelwald, and Oswalde, thre monkes, by whose procurement to Iohn the .xiii. of that name, bishop of Rome.

was an exceadynge great abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacion, for a preest to aryse frome a whores side (for so he called preestes lawfull wyues) and immediatly to goe make gods body.

Thus farre Faber hathe declared by this similitude, that as the spyder spynneth her webbe with muche arte, so hath the dyuell with muche arte made his snare of wyuelesse lyfe: And as the spyder maketh her threede so fyne, that it can not well be seene whan it hangeth in the lyghte, so hathe the dyuell made this snare so fyne and pleasant in the outward shewe with a face of holynesse, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> many can not well see it, although they be in the lyght of the gospell. And as the spider by the help of her fine nettes, catcheth an infinite nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre mo than she shuld do otherwise, so y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuel by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> help of this cloke holy snare, cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth an i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>finit nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre of soules, more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he shuld do otherwise.

If a man calle to remembrance the churche of the old tyme, wherin it was laufull for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes and other ecclesiasticall miny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters to marye, and compareth it to the churche that is nowe adays, he shall fynde in that churche, citees, townes, countreyes, desertes, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where replenyshed with a wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge chastnesse and continencie of solitarye lyuers, of clarkes and of laye men, or that gaue theim selues to no other imbrasynges but theim only whiche be in chaste matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.

            <p>Thus haue I declared fyrst, that mariage and priesthode may stande

            <p>And than that mariage is no hin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derance to a godly lyfe.</p>
            <p>Thyrdely, that the apostles dyd not put away their wyues after the tyme they were called to the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge of the gospell.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that no priest may put away his wyfe, vnder the pretence of religion. And that that vse was fyrste broughte in by the byshope of Rome.</p>
            <p>And last of all, that a priest may marry, after thar he hath receaued the order of priesthode.</p>
            <p>Nowe remaineth onely to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the obiection of the vowe, whiche is bothe fondly and wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully layd to all such prestes charge as wer neuer professed to any other kynde of rule, than to the only or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of priesthode.

But seyng it can not be proued, that there is any suche vowe made by any such preest at the receuing of his charge at the bysho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pes hand, I can not but meruayle greatly, why the aduersaries of pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stes mariages wyll not of a like sort yeld in their argument, their grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d beynge nothyng, and their reasons vnresonable.

that they shal no more credyte their wrong allegacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s with, whom thei be wont to enchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the eares of the vnlearned. Yet bicause this appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth but a siender solucion for the defence of them, which haue in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion withoute question vowed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, to lyue sole all the dayes of their lyfe. I haue wyshed that som learned man wold take the paynes to resolue the vnlearned sorte tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng that poynt, who myght open to them somwhat of the matter, that they should not esteme it so heinous a thynge as they dooe, that a man whiche hathe vowed to lyue all his life sole, should in conclusion marry notwithstanding his vowe. But se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng my wishyng taketh no such ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte, as my wyll was it shoulde, I thought good to leaue of wyshyng and fall to writyng in that poynte, when I see few or none els wyll. True it is, that it can not be proued by scripture, that any Christen man
<pb facs="tcp:5590:33"/>
preest or other can make anye suche vowe of sole lyfe, whiche he can not reuoke agayne when it shall please God to call him to a contrary state, and yet is the contrary opinion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded as though ther were nothing more trew. The place of scripture which is now most alleged to proue the strengthe of the vowe by, is in the fyrst to Timothe the first epistle where Paule sayeth:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Timo.</hi> 5.</note> The wydowes bee subiecte to the slaunder of the worlde, because they haue broken their former promise. If it be grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that Paul in this place speketh of vowes, which thing is in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then afterwarde the same place be well wayed, it wyll appeare that he geueth a determinate sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that all vowes of sole lyfe be of none effect which be made vnder the age of threscore yeares. For the texte hath these wordes. <hi>Non minor annix sexaginta,</hi> Not vnder thage of threscore yeares. By the ordre then
<pb facs="tcp:5590:34"/>
that scripture openeth in this place, all vowes of sole lyfe that be made before that age, bee voyde and of none effecte, bicause they bee not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to the woorde of God. It is euident that Paule in this place wylled Timothie not to credyte the yonger sorte in their vowynge, but aduysed him to obiecte vnto theym their youth &amp; their wanton courage increasing in them that were vnder that age, &amp; so to put them of, and to confute them, as it is playne by the vsyng of the Greke worde, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which signifieth, confute. So that hee alloweth not the vowe of the yonger huswiues, but willeth them to marrye and brynge foorthe chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, continewynge in the hollye state of matrimony, that the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saryes of the Gospell shoulde haue no iust occasion to be offended with their trade of liuyng, who woulde otherwyse bee readye to ieste and rayle vpon them, in case thei shulde

            <p>This note of inconstancy, Paule foresawe that it shoulde be a blotte to the wydowes whiche were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen to bee fedde of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, not easye to be wyped awaye, but that euer they shoulde bee sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte for it, to the obloqui and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusacion of the people. And for that cause Paule sayde, that they were <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>To aduoyde thys inconuenience Paule admonyshed Timothye to refuse suche as woulde shew to bee founde of the Congregacion before the forenamed age, saiyng: <hi>Iuniores reijce,</hi> Admit none of the yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger sort, for feare God shuld be dishonoured by such as had professed his name. Forasmuche, then as the vowe (if ye wyll so call it) or the promyse of
<pb facs="tcp:5590:35"/>
suche as make promyse of sole lyfe, before the age of threscore yeres,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.</note> is against thordre that Paule (indued with the spirit of god) dyd prescribe, it must neades be graunted, that all suche vowes be voyde and of none effect. But it may peraduenture be obiected of some, such as wyl not be answered, that we ought not to call agayne our vowe, if we make it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the age of threscore, bycause the scripture sayeth:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 75.</note> 
               <hi>Vouete &amp; red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite Domino,</hi> Uowe and rendre it to the Lorde. This obiection is thus answered, that we be bounde to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the thing that we vow, accordi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to the ordre appoynted in scripture, if we perceaue the thynge to stande with the pleasure and glory of God and the ordre of his woorde. But it is alleaged that Paule woulde not haue any vow of sole lyfe alow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for good, before the age of three score yeres. Then he that breaketh the vow of sole life made before that
<pb facs="tcp:5590:35"/>
tyme, breaketh no vowe, that is to say, no Christian vowe, but a wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and a diuelysh vow, bycause it was made contrary to the ordre ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted in the woorde of God.</p>
            <p>It must neades be granted, that all our doynges must haue a respect to the glory of God, and the rule pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in hollye scriptures. If we vowe or promyse any thyng other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse, then this rule ruleth vs, wee be bownde to vndooe the thynge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne that we haue done. Euen as the wyfe was bownd<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

And as the chylde, to vnvowe agayne that thynge wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto his father would not consent: So bee wee bownde to vnvowe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne that thynge, wherevnto we perceaue in our selfe by lackyng of the gyfte that our heauenly father
<pb facs="tcp:5590:36"/>
doth not consent. In this mynde it is plain that S. Ciprian was when he willed the virgins, who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mysed to lyue a sole lyfe, to marry, if they perceyued not the gyfte gyuen vnto them so to contynew, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the .xi.

<pb facs="tcp:5590:36"/>
By these woordes it is playne that Saynt Cyprian had not his eye set so muche vpon the vowe that the maydens hadde made, as vpon the glory of God, that he should not be dishonoured, nor the congregacion offended with their followyng vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull lustes and desyres: for that cause he wylled the virgins whiche had vowed, and other woulde nor, or could not continue, to vnsai their vowe agayne &amp; marrye. Further it shoulde seme by the scriptures, that none such as marry after their vow for voidynge of fornication, breake their vow, but kepe it: &amp; that mai be proued thus. S. Iames in the .iiii. chap. of his Epi. giueth an exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to all christen men,<note place="margin">

And although he whiche hathe the gyfte of chaste continencye, is noted of Saynte Austustine to bee better then he, who hathe the gyfte of chaste ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryage: Yet maye he whiche hathe the baser gyfte, bee as good (euen by the aucthoritie of Sayncte Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine) as the other holye menne that enioyed the greater gyfte, and lyued sole without mariage.</p>
            <p>It foloweth not. Ihon the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliste hadde the gyfte to lyue a continent lyfe, ergo, euerye man that wyll, maye so dooe: no more then it followeth, Sampson was hable to take vp vpon hys backe the gaates of a Citee, poastes

and all, and carry theim away vnto a hyll: ergo, euerye man that wyll, maye so dooe. Euerye man is not streyghte waye made a Ihon or a Sampson, that is to say, continent or mighty, with willynge. Suche vowes therefore bee temerous and vnaduysed vowes, although they bee neuer so aduisedly made, when the vower hathe not respecte to the power, whiche he hathe receaued at Goddes hande, for the perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunce of that his vowe.

Is not the vow then an aduersary to God? God sayeth yea: The vowe sayeth naye: Whom ought we to follow? The vowe sayeth: although ye can not absteyne, yet oughte ye not to marry. God sayeth: <hi>Si no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> continent, contrahant matrimonium,</hi> If thei can not lyue chast, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mary. It must neades then be confessed, that that man, which after this sort resoneth with him selfe, and in conclusion for saketh his vow (a thyng of his own makyng) and followeth Christ, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth Christ better then him selfe, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:5590:45"/>
acknowlegeth Christ to be his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. And contrariwyse, that man whyche forsaketh the callynge of Christ, and followeth his vowe, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth hym selfe better than Christe, and acknowledgeth his vowe to be his maister, acordyng to the sayeng of Paule: <hi>Eius serui estis, cui obeditis.</hi> Ye be his serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes,<note place="margin">

If the vowe then stay any man fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maryage, it is a token that his vow was wyckedly made, withoute the exception before mencioned, or els woulde he neuer staye for anye re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>specte to his vowe. And scripture is a wytnesse, that suche men be fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len frome grace, bicause they wyll bee vnder a lawe, whan Christ hath sette theym at lybertie. That vowynge is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a doctrine not taught by Christe, but instytuted by the onely ordynaunce of the Churche, as in the Sexte it dooeth appeare, where it is sayde:<note place="margin">

The partes of this syllogisme be proued in my former processe to hym that wyll wyllyngly waie it.
