         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The divine nature we are said to be Partakers of, is the communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Divine or holy (God like) qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, such whereof we are capable, excluding the perfections of Christ, which are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to the creature.

imperfections of sin, whereof his Divine nature was not capable, nor were sutable to him.</p>
               <p>The water cold by nature, when boyling on the fire, is made <hi>partaker</hi> of the nature of the fire, yet is water still; the waters cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is not incapable of the fires heat; the fires heat expels not the waters moisture; there is fire and water both, water in nature; as fire in quality. The cold and rusty Iron in the fire, loseth both his coldnesse and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; of cold becoms fire hot, of rusty fire-red; It <hi>partakes</hi> of the nature of the fire, yet is but Iron still. Or as <hi>Judas</hi> may be said, when Satan entred into him, to partake of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the divel, <hi>He was a divel;</hi> he lived not, but Satan lived in him, (that is) he<note place="margin">Joh. 6. 70.</note> was full of all sin, hypocrisie, treason, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence, malice, Impenitence, despaire, as if he had been a very divel rather then a man; yet was <hi>Judas Iudas</hi> still, a man, not transformed (at least not trasubstantiated) into a Divel.

               <p>Unity is the glory of the visible heavens, one peerlesse Sun, and of the invisible hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens. 1. The Unity of the Divine Essence in three Persons, <hi>I and my Father are one,</hi>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47132:17"/>
there is an union of an heavenly and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nature. 1. Of a <hi>Deity,</hi> which the other persons have without humanity. 2. Of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,</hi> which we have without a Deity. In this one High Priest alone, the <hi>Thummim</hi> and the <hi>Urim,</hi> the perfections of God, and the light of men conjoyn'd.</p>
               <p>1. Then give unto Christ the glory of this Singular attribute of <hi>Unity,</hi> in a double Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 1. The Unity of faith. 2. Unity of Love.</p>
               <p>1. By an <hi>Unity of faith,</hi> eye Christ on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, eye him with a single eye, look up to no other Mediator; go not to glean in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther field, as was said to <hi>Ruth:</hi> one Sun gives light to all the world, there needs no more. He were a mad man should say, set me up another Sun, or light me a Candle at noon day to help out the Sun: He more irrational who saith, give me somewhat besides Christ, another Mediator.</p>
               <p>It is looked upon as prodigious in nature to see two or three Suns or <hi>Parelii</hi> together. There is no such thing, they are but imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Suns in a cloud, having a little light, no heat or vigorous Influence. There is but one Sun which gives light to these: so to set up Saints merits, the <hi>Virgin Maries Intercession,</hi> or our own duties, were prodigious; all have what they have from Christ, and contribute nothing to him. And these <hi>Parelii</hi> are never seen, but when the Sun is low at morning or evening, never at noone. This flying to the Saints with Papists, or imagined Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47132:18"/>
with some carnal Protestants, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a sign of a dim knowledg, and of a weak faith, never of a sound judgment, and a wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed mind. How unhandsome is a new piece on an old garment, or the garment part wollen, part linnen! Christ will be <hi>Solus</hi> or <hi>nullus. Look to me and be saved, all the ends of the earth, for I am God, and there is none else, Isa.</hi> 45. 22. Each man puts out his candle, and opens his window to let in heaven light when the Sun is up; do so for your souls; tread out your sparks, they may burn thee, they cannot lighten thee. <hi>Isa.</hi> 50. 11. <hi>Behold all ye that kindle a fire, that compasse your selves about with sparks, walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye have kindled: this shall ye have of my hand, ye shall lye down in sorrow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Next look after the other great Unity, <hi>The Unity of love,</hi> the Unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace. Faith and love are the two great uniting graces, faith to the head, love to the members. As there are two great unions in heaven, the first, of <hi>three in one,</hi> Trinity in Unity; the other of two in one, two natures in one person; So next to these two most glorious Unions, there are two mysterial Unions in earth, of <hi>faith</hi> to Christ, where two are one; of <hi>love</hi> to the Church, where all are one. And as this is Gods perfection, so the Churches, according to Christs last Prayer, <hi>John</hi> 17. 17. <hi>That they may be all one, as Thou Father art in me, and</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:47132:18"/>

                  <hi>I in thee,—That they may be made perfect in one.</hi> It was the glory and beauty of the <hi>Wheels,</hi> that they were so Artificially joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one within another, that though divers, they seemed one wheel; and they had all one motion; for one Spirit animated<note place="margin">Ezek. 1. 20.</note> them.</p>
               <p>All those innumerable fixed Stars, keep their proper and certain station, are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore never eclipsed, nor do they eclipse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but move together uniformly; one motion is common to all. The Planets move in several Orbs, no two together, and they are all eclipsed one by another.</p>
               <p>Christians should as Stars in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not thwart, cloud, censure, slight, eclipse each other, disparaging this mans Ministry, question that mans sincerity. Oh that the Trumpet might not make an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or different sound, but bee all as one, as when the Temple was dedicated, and when <hi>Jericho</hi> was besieged, all the Priests blew together, all the people gave one shout, thereby should <hi>Babylons</hi> walls be finally ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 5. 13 Josh. 6. 20.</note> and <hi>Jerusalems</hi> fully repaired.

               </p>
               <p>This Unity of the Spirit would become the bond and cement of our Peace; our <hi>bands</hi> and <hi>beauty,</hi> the staff of the Church in her now old age, and bring in those Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times again, when after stormes

Darest thou trust thine own eyes? open them, thou seest the light of the Sun; or shut them, if thou wilt, thou feelest the heat of the Sun, which though in Heaven, is not far from thee, but ever round about thee.

               <p>The Sun hath his residence in heaven on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but his <hi>Influence</hi> is diffused into all the heavenly bodies, and to all these Sublunary Creatures; air, earth, water, and all the hoste of them; yea, to those subterraneous Mettals and Minerals hid from the Vultures eye. We have the influence and benefit of the Sun in every breath of air, bit of bread, in each dish of flesh, fish, fowle, yea, in each herb used for food or Physick.</p>
               <p>The Sun hath an universal influence upon the Creature in his Generation, production, vegetation, maturation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So Christ upon the new Creature, and upon all his actions and motions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol &amp; homo generat hominem;</hi> The Sunne and man beget a man; the Sun and seed bring forth corn; the Sun and showrs bring on Harvest: But the Sun is one in every thing. So Christ his influence is All in all: In works of Nature, <hi>nothing was made without him at first,</hi> Joh. 1. 3. In works of Grace no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47132:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is, or can be done without him: John 15. 3. <hi>Without me yee can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Christ in the <hi>instruction</hi> gives saving knowledge, Christ in the <hi>conviction</hi> worketh repentance, Christ and the <hi>Promise</hi> work faith, Christ and the <hi>Consolation</hi> works peace. <hi>Accedat Christus ad Elementum, fiet Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum.</hi> Christ and the <hi>Element</hi> make a Sacrament: Christ in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> makes a rare Feast.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sun</hi> hath a various and marvellous <hi>influence;</hi> but our Sun far more.

               <p>The Suns <hi>attractive influence</hi> draweth up grosse, earthy, and watry <hi>vapours,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth them into air. Christ in conversion is so attractive, that hee drawes <hi>earth</hi> up to Heaven, and turnes <hi>Corruption</hi> into Grace.</p>
               <p>The Suns <hi>dissolving influence</hi> again sends downe those Vapors, when <hi>purged</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, in rich and fruitful showres; and <hi>Christ,</hi> those hearts full of grace and Peace, he had before attracted; turning again air into water, melting heavenly hearts into tears of love.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:47132:26"/>The Sun hath a <hi>productive</hi> influence, which animates all seeds, and Christ all gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

               <p>Again, his <hi>mollifying</hi> influence dissolveth congealed mountains of snow, and rocks of ice into fluid water; and Christ at work upon the heart, dissolveth <hi>Petram in fontem, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum in Lachrymas,</hi> turneth impenitents in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Penitents, unbelief into faith, obstinacy into obedience.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Yet 1. True it is there are some <hi>common benefits</hi> all mankind have by Christ, life,<note place="margin">Sol non omnes quos calefacit, illuminat.</note> breath, reason, and comforts of this life; as the Sun affordeth some common benefits to all creatures, who live, grow, increase by vertue of his influence, though they see not his glorious light.</p>
               <p>2. There is also a <hi>sufficiency</hi> in Christ as in the Sun; if there were ten thousands of men more that had eyes to see, they should not want for light; but if all see not, it is not the Suns defect but their owne. There be several sorts of men that have no benefit by the Suns light. 1. Some there bee who are by nature <hi>uncapable</hi> till God give them sight as by a Miracle, being <hi>born blind.</hi> 2. Some lose their sight <hi>accidentally.</hi> 3 Some see not, being <hi>fast asleep,</hi> who open not their eyes. 4. Some <hi>wilfully close their eyes,</hi> and shut their windowes to keep out the light. 5. Some have <hi>weak eyes,</hi> and take offence, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shun the light. 6. Some are <hi>judicially blinded.</hi> as the <hi>Sodomites, Syrians, Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.</hi>

               <p>That none of these have benefit by the Sun, who offers his light to all, is not his fault.

               </p>
               <p>4. <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> as <hi>Mediator</hi> is the Sunne, into whom the God head hath plentifully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted all fulnesse of Divine Light (as the light of heaven is cumulatively aggregated and embodied in the Sun) to be the standing treasury of the Church, as the Sun is of the world.

                  <hi>sang together, when all the Sons of God sung for joy;</hi> glorifying God for the excellency of his work as they were created. These are <hi>Heavenly</hi> Lights.</p>

               <p>2. Next to these are Religious and godly <hi>Magistrates,</hi> Stars of the first magnitude in the inferior orbs; these come in place and dignity next to the Angels in Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, power, and Influence, and when they come neerest to <hi>Scripture Rules</hi> and Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, they are of most sweet aspect, as <hi>Gods</hi> on earth, Gods set over us in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of men; and these are not as the lesser stars, but as the greatest Sun; when they rule in the fear of God (as <hi>David</hi> saith.)<note place="margin">2 Sam. 23. 304</note>

Christ is the only light that discovers to us the <hi>deep things of God,</hi> hid in darknesse till he revealed them; and the <hi>deep things in men,</hi> both the hidden mysteries of unknown wickedness, and the great mysteries of Grace and Godlinesse.</p>
               <p>4. The Light directs us how to walk and<note place="margin">4</note> keep our wayes, and keeps from stumbling and falling into danger. <hi>If any man walk in the day he stumbleth not, because he seeth the</hi>

How many go loaden with Mercies, and lighted with Sermons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Chambers of Hell? How sad, the Samaritans should bee led blindfold into their enemies hands! More sad, if wee will go with open eyes into Perdition, and with the <hi>Decii,</hi> leap headlong into the gaping Gulph at noon day! But much more sad, those Samaritans should be stricken blind by the Prophet, sent of God to be a Seer, and to make the blind to see! How sad was it that the <hi>Sodomites</hi> should bee stricken with blindnesse by an Angel of Light! Sad if Satan the God of the World blind thee; but
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:47132:56"/>
nothing so sad as when Christ shal take away thy sight, and God shall blind thine eyes. For this great <hi>judgment came I into the world, that they who see not may see, and that they</hi>

               <p>4. Though Christ be the great light and Sun, yet remember that <hi>Ministers, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Ordinances,,</hi> are not to be cast aside. God created the <hi>Stars,</hi> and placed them in their orbs, as wel as the Sun; they have their measure of light, and place for use, though all of them united, equal not the Suns light, and he present, they of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle use. Christ holds the Stars in his right hand, both to <hi>present</hi> and <hi>preserve</hi> them; the Church takes them as from Christs hand, and sets them on her head to <hi>honour</hi> them. They are Christs <hi>charge,</hi> and the Churches <hi>Crowne;</hi> in vain is the Arrow shot against the Sun or Stars, it may recoile and wound the shooter, it cannot reach those lights of heaven. Wicked men may be used as Gods snuffers to top (and overtop) his lights (the Ministers) but shall not extinguish them, God hath set them up to give light to his house, he wil not suffer them to be buried under a Bushel.

If you understand it of the Revelation of Christ here, who is the <hi>day-star,</hi> whose discovery of himself by his spirit to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers soul, is the <hi>day dawning;</hi> then is there another mistake in the word <hi>Til,</hi> it is not a <hi>til</hi> of termination, but of provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on rather, and so of continuation stil, <hi>Til I</hi>

               <p>2. This may support the Churches faith in all changes. Let enemies rage, Heresies arise, spread, prevaile; let persecutions and errors unite and gather as a snow-bal, This Sun can scatter them as darknesse, melt them as snow, can cast the burning Mountain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">Rev. 8</note> the sea.

We are afraid of stormes and clouds, and very shadowes; look up to the Sun, it doth rule, it will arise, break out and scatter all. If the Ordinances and Dominion of the Sun should cease, or if it could be pulled out of Heaven, or stayed in his course; if all mists, darkness could put out the light of it, then might we fear. But the Churches comfort is, <hi>The</hi>

               <p>3. If the Sun rule the day not the night, then must we be children of the light, and of the day, not of darknesse and night as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Christ will owne no such subjects, but send them packing to the Prince of darknesse, to whom they belong.</p>
               <p>4. Take notice of the cause of that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene men and men. (The Stars make not men wise, simple, rich, poor, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, vicious.) Christ makes it. Some are chast, sober, zealous, valiant for the Truth, others not. To them it is given, to others not given.

               <p>2. Be like these two great Lights, stand not still. The Sun hath but an <hi>imaginary</hi> solstice twice <hi>per annum;</hi> let not thy whole year be a <hi>Solstice,</hi> or <hi>pingue Otium.</hi> Heavens are always in motion. Earth only stands still;

If the <hi>Master</hi> be up at work, a shame for the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> to be in bed. If <hi>Caesar</hi> say <hi>Eamus,</hi> the soldier marches after.

               <p>The Heathens dedicated <hi>Horses</hi> to the Sun, whom they worshipped, as you read 2 <hi>King</hi> 23. 11. An active Christian is fit to be dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to Christ. But the Asse (a sluggish and dull Brute) was not to be sacrificed, but redeemed, or his neck broke, if the Firstling.

This Gyant is never weary, in an hour he runs thousands of miles, more then we do in many dayes or weeks. One hour is as much to Christ as an Age to us; one day as a thousand years.</p>
               <p>Christ is said to have <hi>wings</hi> here in the Text, he comes not <hi>creeping,</hi> but flying. The <hi>winds</hi> are his wings, the <hi>Cherubims</hi> his Chariots, or his Chariot horses, and <hi>he hath</hi>

               <p>3. The Sun <hi>departing,</hi> night comes on, his <hi>longer absence</hi> brings on winter; in the one so much darknesse, in the other so much of cold, wet, and dirt, as if it been never had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day or Summer. What a night of darknesse came upon <hi>Lot</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> (Christs back once turned) but what a longer winter for cold, and mire, and dirty waies on <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> upon that sad dereliction! The actings of Saints in such cases differing little from the most vile actings of gracelesse men, if they were to be judged by such <hi>single</hi> exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitances. But Sunne ariseth and returneth, those then awake by repentance, and come to themselves again.</p>
               <p>4. It is the Sun which makes that difference in <hi>climes</hi> and countries, makes one more sweet and delightful, another more sad, and not inhabitable, (those neer both Poles;) makes one more fertile, others more barren. And what is it but Christs presence, which makes the Church differ from the rest of the world? he makes it a <hi>Goshen,</hi> whereas they have a perpetual night and winter. What was it wherein Israel might glory above all other nations, but this? they had God so neer to them, in all which they called to him for; His cloud and pillar was continually among them.</p>
               <p>5. The Sun is the great <hi>Restorer</hi> of the world, <hi>Redintegrates</hi> the <hi>Universe</hi> once in the yeare (at the Spring, as some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,

               <p>6. I might further also speak of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive,</hi> and as it were the <hi>Creating</hi> effects of the Sun in bringing forth new Creatures yearly, as well as of his <hi>reductive, reviving,</hi> and <hi>redeeming</hi> the plants and herbs before dead and gone, as also of his <hi>nutritive</hi> and <hi>augmentative</hi> effects on all <hi>Vegetables,</hi> his admirable <hi>Alterative</hi> vertue and operation on Metals and Minerals, his <hi>Conservative, Maturative</hi> and <hi>Consummative</hi> Vertue and Effects on the Fruits and living Creatures; but I have touched on them already. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is Christ his vigorous operations fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented; who besides his <hi>redeeming</hi> lost man, maketh the <hi>new Creature,</hi> createth grace <hi>de novo</hi> where none was, <hi>recovereth</hi> what was lost, <hi>reviveth</hi> what was decayed; <hi>nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth</hi> what is weak, <hi>increaseth</hi> what is small, <hi>conserveth</hi> what is wrought, hath a more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable <hi>alterative</hi> force in an earthly or sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny heart, then the Sun in causing Gold and Silver to grow in the earth, making <hi>flesh</hi> to grow where stone was, <hi>spirit</hi> where <hi>flesh</hi> was, <hi>grace</hi> where <hi>sin, Heaven</hi> where <hi>Hell</hi> was;

When the Sun approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, the <hi>Elements</hi> change their habit and temper, the <hi>Air</hi> growes more mild, warm, and pleasant, and all those numerous te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants (those daughters of Musick) do war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and eccho out their cheerful notes to the praise of the Sun; they build, they breed, they rejoyce (many of them come, stay, returne with this their great Leader and Commander.) The <hi>waters</hi> wax warme and temperate; there the fishes leap, play, breed and multiply. But the <hi>Earth</hi> especially dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked as a <hi>Bride</hi> to meet this <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theth her selfe, and all her family in new and divers coloured apparel, and with their several <hi>New years Gifts</hi> present the worlds Benefactor with their Best, that he may not come in vain to any of their dwellings. Oh that wee were the Creatures Scholers, or School-fellowes in this respect, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the benefits, admire the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, sing out the praises of this Sun of Righteousnesse, and with our best Presents

of Thankfulnesse and Fruitfulnesse: shew we are loath to receive so much grace in vaine.</p>

The Suns Eclipse is often and <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,</hi> but this was <hi>extraordinary,</hi> preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and but once.</p>
               <p>2. The Sun is never <hi>totally Eclipsed;</hi> in part often. (His body being so many times bigger then the Moon's interposed, <hi>seven thousand</hi> times bigger, cannot lose all his light.) So Christ might be in his <hi>Person</hi> eclipsed to the unbelieving Jewes by his poverty, Cross and afflictions (whereby <hi>he was made lower then</hi>

               <p>2. In his <hi>Truth,</hi> by Hereticks and prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Errors.</p>

               <p>3. Yet was there once (never but once) a <hi>total Eclipse</hi> of the Sun; extraordinary it was, <hi>viz.</hi> at the time of Christ his Passion. Christ never had the light of his Fathers countenance wholly suspended, but then <hi>in Articulo Passionis,</hi> when he cryed out, <hi>Eli-Eli-Lama-sabactani.</hi> Such an Eclipse never did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor can happen again: then did it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear Christ <hi>set his Tabernacle in the Sun;</hi> that was his Chariot or Apostle. The Sunnes <hi>darknesse</hi> then <hi>enlightned</hi> the world, and<note place="margin">
                     <hi>There was dark ness over all the earth from the sixth to the ninth hour,</hi> that is, from twelve a Clock to three <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 45</note> made the Philosopher cry out, <hi>Deus naturae patitur, aut mundi Machina dissolvitur.</hi> Either the God of Nature is now suffering, or the frame of the world is dissolving; then both Suns suffered, and were eclipsed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and went down at noon day; the <hi>Sun of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>that Lord of the Sun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. The <hi>Suns Eclipse</hi> is only caused by
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:47132:83"/>
the <hi>interposition</hi> of the <hi>Moons</hi> dark body, which hath all her light from the Sun. The Sun is then obscured, and the new changed Moon (never else seen by day) then dare shew her self.</p>
               <p>It is the only interposing the <hi>Churches dark body</hi> of sin and guilt, made this Sun ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured. She hath no light of her owne, but borroweth of him, and hee was content to lose all his glory <hi>protempore,</hi> that his Church and every new <hi>changed</hi> (<hi>converted</hi>) soul may appear before God with boldness, not otherwise able to abide the tryal of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</p>
               <p>5. It is a <hi>sight sad</hi> to behold when the Sun is Eclipsed: and it was the saddest day and <hi>hour of darknesse</hi> that ever was in the world, when Christ was put to death.</p>
               <p>6. The Sun as to us <hi>seemeth,</hi> to lose his light; but as to <hi>Heaven,</hi> gives more. And Christ never <hi>shined</hi> more bright in <hi>Heaven,</hi> never gave like <hi>satisfaction</hi> to God, more <hi>Joy</hi> to Angels, <hi>Glory</hi> to Saints, then in his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.

               <p>8. Some great Scholers have said, The Suns Eclipse bodes much ill to this lower world, and that the sad effects thereof are such, that the world is the worse for it seven years after, ere it recover it self. The truth whereof I'l not dispute: but certaine I am, the sad effects of this Eclipse upon the <hi>Land of Iudea,</hi> where it was most visible, are not yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>9. Lastly, The Suns Eclipse is said to <hi>Prognostick</hi> great changes, downfal of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and deaths of Tyrants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sure I am, that this Eclipse did not foretel as a <hi>Prognostick,</hi> but <hi>produce</hi> as the immediate cause, the greatest changes in heaven and earth. Then was Satan ruined; this Eclipse was his bane. When the <hi>Vyal</hi> of Gods wrath was poured on this Sun, and hee had<note place="margin">John 19. 30</note> cryed, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>It is finished,</hi> then was Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans Kingdome <hi>darkned, divided, destroyed,</hi> then was the Prince of this world judged and cast out; and then was there nothing but gnawing of tongues all the Kingdom of the Dragon over.</p>
               <p>2. There are many lesse Accidents.</p>
               <p>1. The Sun is sometimes present, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times absent, <hi>respectu nostri,</hi> but alwayes present in heaven, Christ sometimes <hi>leading</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:47132:85"/>
his Beloved, sometimes <hi>leaving</hi> his Beloved; alwayes interceding and giving light in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when his light shineth not on us.</p>
               <p>2. Sometimes it <hi>hides</hi> it selfe, sometimes <hi>showes</hi> it self; but his light is <hi>intrinsecally</hi> the same without change. So there may bee changes <hi>in</hi> us, mists <hi>about</hi> us, stormes <hi>above</hi> us; none in Heaven. <hi>Amas nec estuas; z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>3. Sometimes Sun riseth <hi>early,</hi> shines out at first rising gloriously, yet a stormy day followes, and again clears up at <hi>even,</hi> and all ends well. Some in first Conversion have much peace and comfort, as <hi>Job, Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> the <hi>Wise men,</hi> had the Star at first set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out, afterwards sad stormes, desertions and tryals; but all ended well.</p>
               <p>4. Sometimes at Sun rise the morning is <hi>gray,</hi> dark, duskish, and the day the <hi>fairer.</hi> What stormes were at the Conversion of the <hi>Jaylor</hi> and of <hi>Paul?</hi> yet all faire after.</p>
               <p>5. Sometimes the Sun not seen all day, but showres from morning till almost Sun-set, then Sun breaks out and sets <hi>sereuely,</hi> and promiseth a fair day following. Some true

again, and we as bad to our thinking as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; but never any so perfect here as to be free from sin; <hi>It doth easily beset us,</hi> and we are all <hi>Periscii,</hi> in this sense; sin is as insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from our <hi>imperfect nature</hi> here, as the shadow from the body.

               </p>
               <p>10, Once more. The Sun, how doth it with his beames alter the native and usual <hi>colour</hi> of things? rising, it <hi>gilds</hi> the clouds, <hi>enamels</hi> the drops of dew, makes them look like so many drops of <hi>Pearle;</hi> but especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how doth it adorne that watry <hi>melting</hi> cloud whereon the <hi>Rainbow</hi> is set, the refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his own face, with all the delightful <hi>colours</hi> which the eye can behold?</p>
               <p>So Christ arising and shining upon the black uncomely soul, puts it into another complexion. <hi>When thou wast deformed, I made thee comely through my comelinesse; and thou wast perfect through my comelinesse which I put upon thee,</hi> Ezek. 16. 14.

               <p>Yet sometimes the Sun arising and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, hath represented some things in a more dreadful appearance then before, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. 22. <hi>When the Moabites rose up ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Morning, and the Sun shone upon the water in the trenches, the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as bloud, and said, This is bloud, &amp;c.</hi> Nothing represents sin in so horrid and amazing a dresse to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>

Of his <hi>Office;</hi> his <hi>Mediatory Office.</hi> This is the meaning of that before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Scripture, <hi>This is the name wherewith he shall be called, The Lord our Righteousness;</hi> that is to say, this is his Office and Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>2. For the second. There is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> we have by Christ.</p>
               <p>1. A <hi>common, general, original</hi> (as I may call it) or <hi>imputed</hi> Righteousnesse, a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness without us, to which we contribute nothing, we only accept. <hi>We put on this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and it clothes us,</hi> as a garment made ready to our hands.</p>
               <p>2 A <hi>particular, personal, inherent, actual Righteousnesse,</hi> which some call <hi>imparted</hi> (as the other <hi>imputed</hi>) but not so properly, for both are imparted.</p>
               <p>As all are under a <hi>double unrighteousnesse,</hi> so Believers are under a <hi>double Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> 1. One <hi>common, imputed</hi> unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, alike in all, without any <hi>Magis &amp; minus,</hi> good and bad having a like share of guilt and contagion from <hi>Adam,</hi> his sin imputed, his corruption imparted and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to us. 2 A personal and particular, which we call <hi>actual</hi> unrighteousnesse; and is (besides that imputed guilt and offence,) a particular, <hi>vicious disposition</hi> of the mind unto evil; and is made up of all those ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malous and sinful actions, which are so many Trangressions of the Law of God. This recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a <hi>magis</hi> and <hi>minus</hi> in those in whom sin
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:47132:90"/>
doth not raigne, much more in whom sinne doth fully raign and command: for among those possessed with Divels one had but one, and another seven, another had a whole <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> of Divels.</p>
               <p>So is there I say a double Righteousness which Believers have. 1. One common and imputed, which is to speak properly, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Christ his Righteousnesse <hi>personally,</hi> but ours <hi>relatively:</hi> His by <hi>operation,</hi> ours by <hi>imputation.</hi> 2 Besides this, they have a personal Righteousness which is made up of those <hi>gracious inclinations</hi> in the heart to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good, and of those many <hi>holy actions</hi> they perform in conformity and obedience to the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Pattern</hi> of Righteousnesse; of which two (that is, those gracious <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions</hi> and <hi>actions</hi>) our personal or inherent Righteousness is made up. Now both these <hi>Righteousnesses</hi> wee have from Christ; the <hi>matter</hi> of the one, <hi>viz.</hi> imputed Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse; and the <hi>principle, power and ability</hi> whereby we are carried out and inabled to the other. Concerning which twofold Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse we shal lay down briefly these few <hi>Theses.</hi>

                     <hi>Thes. 3.</hi> Imputed Righteousdesse is alike to all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no <hi>magis &amp; minus,</hi> the strong Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hath not more, nor the weak Believer less of this: inherent righteousness hath different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees as actual sin hath.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Thes. 4.</hi> Imputed Righteousness is <hi>simul &amp; semel,</hi> made over to the Believer all at once, and once for all; it admits of no <hi>magis &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis</hi> in the same person, as of no <hi>magis &amp; minus</hi> in others Believers.

               <p>In the day of <hi>Expiation</hi> (the solemnest Gospel day <hi>Israel</hi> had in all the year) four things were done: 1. the <hi>Trumpet</hi> sounded. 2 Every soul was <hi>afflicted,</hi> and upon hard du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<note place="margin">Lev. 16</note> of Humiliation. 3 Then were <hi>Sacrifices</hi> offered. 4.

               <p>The Holy Ghost hereby shadowed out to them, what was to be done by us in order to an <hi>Attonement.</hi> 1. The Trumpet sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; <hi>.i.</hi> the Gospel is to be proclaimed.</p>
               <p>2. When the Gospel is proclaimed, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Israelite</hi> is to <hi>afflict</hi> his soul for sin, that he may partake of the benefit of the Gospel.

children which learn to go, who having nothing to hold on, hold on their own clothes, which throws them down. Rely alone on Christ for Righteousnesse.

               <p>3. This shewes us what a difference there is between <hi>Adam</hi> and Christ. <hi>Adam</hi> a <hi>Sea of Unrighteousness,</hi> Christ a Sea of <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness. Adam</hi> a <hi>falling Star,</hi> a blazing Meteor, who fell with <hi>Lucifer</hi> that bright Morning Star, and suffered a total Eclipse; Christ a <hi>Sun,</hi> a fixed <hi>Sun</hi> of Righteousness.

The greater Luminary, suffered a <hi>final</hi> (not <hi>total</hi>) eclipse; all the Angelical Nature fel not. The less, a <hi>total</hi> (not a <hi>final.</hi>) The greater, contrary to what is in the course of Nature, suffered the greater Eclipse. But <hi>Adams</hi> was a sad Eclipse; He lost all his Righteousness and Light for the time, as did the Angels: He conveyes to us nothing but sin and wrath. We may sadly say, that of the first <hi>Adam,</hi> which was said of Christ, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>4 How should this consideration, that Christ is the <hi>Sun of Righteousnesse,</hi> endear him to us, and heighten our esteem of him! Who can give unto God the praises due for the benefit of the <hi>aire</hi> we breath in, and of the <hi>Sun</hi> whose light we walk in? But for this Sun of Righteousness, by whom wee are both Justified and Sanctified, enlightned and enlivened, what praises can be given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God sufficient for such a Mercy? It was Righteousnesse we wanted more then light. The Sun had not lost his light, nor <hi>Adam</hi> his sight by the fall, but all that Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse wherewith he was adorned: we need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not a new Sun in the Heaven to lighten the body, but a new Sun of Righteousnesse to enliven the soul.

               </p>
               <p>2. There is a <hi>good</hi> Righteousness, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there be four <hi>kinds</hi> or <hi>degrees.</hi> 1. The <hi>Philosophical:</hi> 2. <hi>Pharisaical.</hi> 3. <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical.</hi> 4 <hi>Divine,</hi> or Righteousness of God.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:47132:98"/>
Two of these are <hi>External,</hi> two <hi>Internal,</hi> all of them together make perfectly righteous before God and men.</p>
               <p>1 The first and <hi>lowest</hi> Righteousness, is that we call <hi>Civil,</hi> Moral, or <hi>Philosophical.</hi> The Righteousness of <hi>Nations,</hi> taught in their Schools, and practised in their Polities. This alone is enough to make one to become <hi>bonus Civis,</hi> but is the lowest ingredient, which joyned with the other three, makes also the <hi>bonus Christianus.</hi> This is not to be spoken against; the world is not so full of it. The Prophet complaineth that God had a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie with his people for want of <hi>moral honesty. There is neither Mercy, nor Truth, nor knowledg of God in the Land, but swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:47132:98"/>
against neither, but countenanced. Religion teacheth not to lay aside Holy Duties, but perform them better; not to fail in one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but abound in all; not to call any <hi>Duty</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment little.</hi> This was the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, who walked</hi>

               </p>
               <p>3. The third Righteousness is of <hi>Graces:</hi> This an <hi>inward Righteousnesse,</hi> better then both the former, and that which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends them. This the <hi>Evangelical</hi> Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, made up of Evangelical <hi>Graces,</hi> Faith, Love, Repentance, Obedience, good Conscience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This the Righteousness of the Gospel, or <hi>Law of Faith.</hi> This exceeds the Righteousness of Philosophers, and of Scribes and Pharisees.

Grace doth raign by righteousness to eternal life. Yield your members servants to Righteousness unto Holiness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. The fourth and best of all, is the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeusness of faith,</hi> or the Righteousness of <hi>Christ,</hi> which commendeth all the former and exceeds them. This is called the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness

                  <hi>from evil.</hi> Grace destroyes not nature, but reformes the evil of it.</p>
               <p>2 There is an evil fear (<hi>inordinate and immoderate fear</hi>) which sometimes a Godly man is incident to, and overtaken with; for which they are to be chidden and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; <hi>Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?</hi>

               <p>1. He might have a fowle scab, yet if it<note place="margin">Lev. 13. 56</note> did not <hi>spread</hi> or <hi>increase,</hi> but <hi>stand at a stay,</hi>

he was not unclean; <hi>it is but a scab.</hi> There are sad spots which may bee the spots of Gods people: but they stand at a stay.</p>

               <p>3 If no <hi>raw flesh</hi> did appear, though hee were covered with <hi>Leprosie,</hi> he was also clean, otherwise not. Godly men may have been <hi>all covered</hi> with foule sins <hi>before</hi> Conversion, but they are turued white by <hi>Repentance:</hi> They fall <hi>after</hi> Conversion into some grosse sin; it is a <hi>scab,</hi> it spreads not: Or they are covered with a world of infirmities, but there is no <hi>raw</hi> or <hi>proud flesh</hi> to be seen; <hi>these are clean.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>3 <hi>How low</hi> a child of God may fall in point of <hi>Grace,</hi> yet be <hi>safe.</hi> The <hi>maximum quod sic</hi> of an Hypocrite, and the <hi>minimum quod sic</hi> of a Saint, are hard to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>

               <p>8 Where sin is as <hi>death,</hi> it brings not <hi>death.</hi> It is <hi>mortuum,</hi> not <hi>mortiferum:</hi> Where sin <hi>lives</hi> the soul must <hi>dye.</hi> If <hi>Agag</hi> be spared, <hi>Saul</hi> shall not be spared. <hi>Who shall deliver mee from the body of this death!</hi>

               <p>I may add a few other Notes from other Scriptures.</p>
               <p>1 Sin whereby the heart is <hi>broken</hi> hinders not Salvation, but sin whereby the heart is <hi>hardned. Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Magus</hi> had hearts hardned by sin, <hi>Peters</hi> was broken with his.</p>
               <p>2 Sin <hi>fallen into</hi> when one is overtaken, damns not, sin <hi>continued in</hi> is that which damns. <hi>David</hi> fel, <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jeroboam</hi> lay in their sin.</p>
               <p>3 Sins of <hi>infirmity</hi> and <hi>inadvertency</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 9. 21.</note> damne not; such was <hi>Noahs.</hi> Sins of <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration</hi> destroy Salvation. There was a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Refuge for him that slew a man <hi>unwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly,</hi> and a pardon of course, but <hi>wilful</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 19. 4, 11</note> 
                  <hi>Murder</hi> had no benefit of Sanctuary. Christ will be no City of Refuge to him whose <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption</hi> of pardon is his <hi>provocation</hi> to sin.</p>
               <p>4 Sin against <hi>resolution</hi> destroyes not Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, Such was <hi>Peters</hi> denyal of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:47132:116"/>
into which he fell through too much <hi>fear;</hi> sin <hi>resolved upon</hi> damnes: Such was <hi>Judas</hi> his betraying his Master, which he had long plotted, and had watched for an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to effect.</p>
               <p>5 Sin <hi>confessed</hi> and discovered, is ever <hi>covered</hi> and <hi>remitted:</hi> sin <hi>covered</hi> and <hi>concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proverbs 28 1 John 1</note> shall be proclaimed on the house top. <hi>He that hideth his sin shall not prosper; Hee that confesseth and forsaketh, findeth mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6 <hi>Sin repented of</hi> never damns; sin not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of ever damns. Take the <hi>two thieves</hi> for an example: the one dyed in the presence of a Saviour, his <hi>impenitency</hi> made him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of Salvation: the other, though in the same condemnation, saved by meanes of his <hi>true,</hi> though <hi>late repentance.</hi> But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occasion of this rare (indeed sole) example of the Thief on the Crosse, we may use that Proverb, Many talk of <hi>Robin Hood</hi> who never shot in his bow; so many speak of the <hi>Thief on the Crosse,</hi> who do nothing like him. He confessed Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>enemies,</hi> these deny, revile him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his <hi>friends.</hi> He <hi>believed</hi> in him, <hi>prayed</hi> to him, <hi>relyed</hi> on him; these do none of these. How much grace did appear in that man in so little a time! 1. <hi>Zeal</hi> for God, he rebuked the profane Thief. 2. <hi>Charity</hi> to man whom he would reclaime, <hi>Dost not thou yet fear God, being in this condemnation?</hi> as if he should say, Cast not away thy soul, there is yet hope or possibility of Salvation.

3. His <hi>repentanee</hi> manifested in that <hi>self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning</hi> and <hi>God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> justifying</hi> expression, <hi>We suffer justly.</hi> 4. His <hi>Faith</hi> in Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom he justified, when the world condemned him, <hi>He hath done nothing amiss.</hi> 5. His <hi>Prayer</hi> of <hi>faith, Lord remember me when thou comest into thy Kigdom.</hi> Verily there was not found <hi>so much faith in all Israel,</hi> no not among all the <hi>Apostles</hi> who forsook him and <hi>fled.</hi> I may call his faith, a <hi>faith of Miracles,</hi> as well as his Conversion a <hi>mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Conversion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7 Sin <hi>forsaken</hi> never, sin not <hi>forsaken</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>damns.</hi> When <hi>Manasseh</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal</hi> returned, they found the gate of Mercy open to entertain them. <hi>Cast away your Transgressions,</hi> and you shall not be cast away. <hi>Electio aut dilectio peccati re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probatio peccatoris.</hi> It is that <hi>Reprobate</hi> sin, that reprobates <hi>soules.</hi> But sin reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and rejected, the soul is elected and beloved.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> That Christ shall certainly and timely arise upon all such as fear his Name.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>TO you that fear my name shall the Sun of Righteousness arise.</hi>]</p>
               <p>Having spoken of Christ apart, that he is the <hi>Sun of Righteousness,</hi> and of the godly apart, that they are such as <hi>fear his Name;</hi> We will now bring them together, (and they are best when together) Christ and they that fear his Name.</p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>What ever the present condition and apprehension of such as fear Gods Name may be, there shall be a day when Christ shall rise upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They shall come out of the <hi>cold shade</hi> into the <hi>warm Sun,</hi> and out of all their darkness into his <hi>marvellous light. To the upright a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth light in darkness,</hi> saith <hi>David.</hi> They<note place="margin">Psalm 112. 4 Isaiah 60. 1</note> shall hear that voice, <hi>Arise, shine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To speak the least, all the godly shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they <hi>taste of death</hi> see this Promise ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, and see the <hi>Kingdom of God come into them with power;</hi> or when they have <hi>tasted of death,</hi> they shall enter with <hi>power</hi> into the Kingdom of God, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 1. where our
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:47132:118"/>
Saviour implies, 1 That the godly do but <hi>taste or sip</hi> of deaths cup. It is a bitter poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the wicked who drink the <hi>dregs.</hi> Christ <hi>tasted</hi> of death himself, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9. Wicked ones are said to <hi>dy the death,</hi> the godly to taste onely; and Christ is their <hi>Taster,</hi> therefore they need not fear it. 2. Nor shall they so much as <hi>taste</hi> neither till they have had a <hi>taste of Heaven,</hi> the Kingdome of God coming with power. Saint <hi>John</hi> had<note place="margin">Revel. 10. 9</note> 
                  <hi>honey</hi> in his mouth, before the <hi>gall</hi> in his belly. God will Antidote his servants against the <hi>bitterness</hi> of death by his cordial Promise; and then death tastes <hi>sweet,</hi> when heaven is tasted before.</p>
               <p>This Promise doth imply, 1. That such as belong to God, and have true grace, (<hi>fear his name</hi>) may have small store of <hi>Peace and Comfort,</hi> no present sense and taste of the love<note place="margin">Isaiah 50. 10</note> of God, but walk long in darkness, seeing no light at all.</p>
               <p>2 That as their condition is <hi>sad,</hi> their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension may be <hi>sadder,</hi> having nothing but fears, dreadfull fears of the Name of God.</p>
               <p>3 Or that they may after a short <hi>winter day</hi> have a long night, without <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> a long time, as <hi>Pauls</hi> company in their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Sea Voyage. They may cry out with many a longing wish for day, and say with<note place="margin">Job 29. 2. 3</note> 
                  <hi>Job, Oh that it were with me as in times past, when the candle of God shined upon my head, when by his light I walked through darknesse.</hi>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:47132:118"/>
The Lord is to some of his people as a <hi>way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring man that turnes aside to tarry but one</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 14. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>night.</hi> The Lord <hi>comes guest-wise,</hi> as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel to <hi>Manoahs wife,</hi> who after the first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition waited long for a <hi>second visite,</hi> and<note place="margin">Judg. 13. 21.</note> having that, never had a <hi>third;</hi> her busband never had but one.</p>
               <p>4. They may be <hi>long</hi> under sad <hi>desertions,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lam. 3. 17.</note> even to <hi>forget prosperity,</hi> and complaine <hi>pro tempore,</hi> as if God dealt with them as with <hi>Saul. I am sore distressed, and the Lord hath</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 28. 15</note> 
                  <hi>forsaken me, and answereth me no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. They may be also <hi>sick</hi> withall (which makes <hi>long nights</hi> seeme <hi>much longer</hi>) soule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, their hearts fainting for the salvation of God, as <hi>David</hi> complained, saying, when<note place="margin">Ps. 119. 81, 82</note> wilt thou comfort me. What need of this sun-rising <hi>with healing</hi> else?</p>
               <p>6. They may be also ready to sink under the weight of their own guilt, and Gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure. What need of a Sunne of <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse</hi> else?</p>
               <p>7. Yet suppose all this, and what more you can, Christ shall arise to purpose on these poore soules as the Sun in his strength, <hi>dispel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> darknesse (as a cloud) <hi>dispersing</hi> righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse (as beames of light) <hi>curing</hi> all the soule distempers with his healing vertue.</p>
               <p>1. The reason hereof is partly from some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what<note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>in God.</hi> 2. Partly from somewhat <hi>in themselves.</hi> 1. <hi>On Gods part.</hi> 1. His <hi>Power</hi> gives the first hope of it. He can say, <hi>Let he re be light,</hi> and there shall be light. Hee
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:47132:119"/>
who at first commanded light to shine out of darknesse, can cause his marvellous light<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.</note> to shine on those who sit in darknesse.</p>
               <p>2. His <hi>power</hi> gives hope, but his <hi>promise</hi> (this promise here and many others) makes it <hi>certain.</hi> When God created the first light, there was onely <hi>power</hi> and <hi>will</hi> set a work, there had been no <hi>Promise;</hi> here is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise: Gods power makes things <hi>possible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> his promise, things <hi>certain.</hi> It was onely <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> there should bee these heavens and this earth before Creation; there was no promise. But it is <hi>certain</hi> there shall be <hi>a new heaven</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>and new earth,</hi> because wee <hi>according to his promise</hi> expect it. It was <hi>possible</hi> that Christ <hi>might come to dissolve the works of Satan</hi> when <hi>Adam</hi> fell. But is <hi>certain</hi> Christ shall come to them <hi>that fear him;</hi> Here is his promise.</p>
               <p>3. His <hi>Love</hi> backs his <hi>promise,</hi> as that his<note place="margin">Psal. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>power.</hi> He that is for <hi>Power</hi> a <hi>Gyant,</hi> and for his <hi>promise</hi> and engagement <hi>Sponsor,</hi> is for his love as a <hi>Bridegroome</hi> and Spouse to his Church, whom he hath <hi>betrothed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in loving kindnesse, righteousnesse, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hos. 2. 19. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>and faithfulnesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. His <hi>glory</hi> engageth all the former. There is never more glory given to God then when he maketh good this promise. Great rejoycing there is when shee who hath been long barren, hath <hi>conceived,</hi> as <hi>Sarah, Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah.</hi> When he who hath been long in <hi>cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity</hi> is <hi>inlarged,</hi> as <hi>Joseph;</hi> when the <hi>exile</hi> is
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:47132:119"/>
                  <hi>returned,</hi> when the <hi>blind</hi> come to <hi>see.</hi> The privation or want of the <hi>mercy</hi> sets the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er price upon it when it comes. The <hi>desire attained is a tree of life.</hi> Here the greatest<note place="margin">Prov. 13. 12.</note> joy. <hi>Sing Oh barren, thou that didst not bear,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isai. 54. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>break forth into singing, and cry aloud thou that didst not travel with child<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sharon</hi> brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth forth into singing, and <hi>Lebanon</hi> claps his hands, and all the birds of the wood, and beasts of the field sing and leap for joy. The earth puts on her new clothes to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the welcome sun.</p>
               <p>2. Partly, from <hi>somewhat in them.</hi> 1. Their <hi>prayers</hi> raise this sun (as the Prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is raised by magick spels, and cursed imprecations,) Christ is raised by invocation. Thus the Disciples made the <hi>Sunrise</hi> before <hi>day,</hi> to still the tempest. What the Poets fained of the <hi>Moons</hi> coming downe to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dymion,</hi> may bee spiritually verified of Christ. This Sun of righteousnesse often comes downe to imbrace such as fear him, and call him downe by prayer.</p>
               <p>2. Because of their <hi>miseries.</hi> In all their<note place="margin">Isai. 63. 9. Psal. 12. 5. Isai. 57. 18. Ezek. 16. 6.</note> spiritual affliction, <hi>he is afflicted,</hi> and because of the <hi>sighing of the afflicted,</hi> he saith, <hi>I will up,</hi> I will <hi>rise</hi> and <hi>shine</hi> upon him; I have looked upon him, and see him in <hi>his bloud,</hi> I will <hi>heale him,</hi> and say unto him, <hi>live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Their <hi>prayers</hi> move him much, their <hi>miseries</hi> more. But their <hi>grace</hi> make his bowels to role, and his repentings kindled within him. I have <hi>heard him bemoaning</hi>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:47132:120"/>
                  <hi>himselfe, I will surely have mercy on him: I</hi>

                  <hi>have spoken against, but I will now remember him. Repentance</hi> is such a grace as over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Gods displeasure; holy <hi>fear</hi> gaines his <hi>favour; faith</hi> gets his <hi>heart; humility</hi> gets what grace it would have; he that <hi>resists</hi> the proud, and departs from the ungodly, <hi>He loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 33. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>upon man, and if any say, I have sinned and perverted that which is right, and it profited me not, He will deliver his soule from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.</hi> So that we may say, <hi>Light is sowen for the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 97. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>and joy for the upright in heart:</hi> sowen in these <hi>two fields,</hi> 1. <hi>Of Gods eternall decree,</hi> in his <hi>power, promise, grace</hi> and <hi>love:</hi> These are the <hi>upper springs.</hi> 2. In the field of their <hi>graces,</hi> and holy <hi>duties,</hi> these are the <hi>neather springs,</hi> both which fal into one ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and <hi>make glad the City of God,</hi> both these <hi>fields</hi> yield a plentiful <hi>harvest</hi> of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the godly.</p>
               <p>Quest. <hi>But here the godly soul is oft troubled and saith,</hi> when shall this promise bee<note place="margin">Ezek. 12. 27</note> fulfilled? this vision is for many dayes to come. When will this Sun arise?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Though the Sun keep a certaine houre of his arising knowne to all, yet <hi>of this day and hour knoweth no man,</hi> when this Sun of righteousnesse will arise. The operation and course of <hi>nature</hi> is much alike. The dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> are various &amp; more different then any other actings of God, therefore nothing can be set downe
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:47132:120"/>
certainly as a constant rule.</p>
               <p>There are four <hi>notable dayes</hi> of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ, two in <hi>this life,</hi> two <hi>after,</hi> all alike unknowne. 1. When <hi>Christ</hi> will come with his <hi>fanne</hi> in his hand, refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners <hi>fire,</hi> and fullers <hi>soap,</hi> at conversion to purifie an elect <hi>unconverted.</hi> 2. When with <hi>healing</hi> under his wings, to cheer and satisfie the <hi>Elect converted,</hi> yet unsatisfied soule. 3. The third great and notable day of the Lord is at <hi>death,</hi> when he comes as a <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome,</hi> his reward with him to make <hi>perfect</hi> the elect converted, comforted soule; yet never <hi>perfected.</hi> And the fourth is the greatest of all when he <hi>cometh in the clouds</hi> to render to all according to their deeds. None of these four dayes <hi>of the Lord</hi> are like the <hi>Lords day</hi> which is knowne and kept by all alike, and we know that after every <hi>six dayes</hi> another will certainly follow; but as the <hi>thiefe</hi> by night, or the <hi>lightning</hi> (not<note place="margin">Lu. 17, 24, 25 27</note> the sun) by day, come suddenly, unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, or as the dayes of <hi>Noah</hi> and of <hi>Lot</hi> were, so shall all these <hi>comings</hi> of the Son of man be. 1. Those dayes came but <hi>once.</hi> 2. Came of a <hi>sudden.</hi> 3. Came to put a mighty <hi>difference</hi> between them and others, yet had we not need bee as the world was then, <hi>Eating, drinking, sinning, singing, &amp;c.</hi> but as <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> fearing, waiting, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, preparing.</p>

               </p>
               <p>2. The other is in heaven; There are <hi>glorious times</hi> to bee expected indeed, when <hi>the Sun shall no more give light by day, nor the Moone by night, but the Lord shall be thy</hi>

               </p>

               <p>The same seed brings forth the straw and corne too; the husk, chaffe and kernel grow together, but are oft parted, not to their losse. The corne is beaten out of the straw by <hi>threshing,</hi> the kernel from the chaff by <hi>winnowing,</hi> yet are both the purer and more fit for use; Grace and Peace grow both upon one stalk, yet may Grace be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out of Peace and remaine pure.</p>

                  <hi>naturae,</hi> described by the Prophet, borne <hi>children of wrath,</hi> brought into the world <hi>naked, crying, defiled, lying in their bloud, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> to help themselves, <hi>uncapable</hi> of help from creatures; these doth Christ pity to see them dying, and saith <hi>Live,</hi> washeth, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointeth, feedeth, closeth, nurseth, ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, at last glorifieth them.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Besides this,</hi> all the godly are <hi>born blind,</hi> as he <hi>John</hi> 9. and are not like many other<note place="margin">Leonum &amp; ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num catuli, &amp;c.</note> creatures whose <hi>young</hi> see not for certaine dayes, but after that nature gives them sight; but we should <hi>never see,</hi> if Christ did not annoint our eyes with <hi>his eye-salve.</hi>

               <p>1. To be <hi>sick of love</hi> to Christ. This is no Disease, but the best Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It may be they <hi>are not</hi> healed, and then it is their sin.</p>
               <p>2. It may be they <hi>are</hi> cured, and then it is their <hi>Error.</hi>

               <p>1. It may be they are not cured, and then it is their <hi>sin.</hi>

               <p>1 They go not to this Physician.

But it is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Christ to have the greatest respect to such: What a speech is that? <hi>Heaven is my</hi>

               <p>4. Here is then a singular encouragement for all distressed souls to go to Christ.

               <p>So when in creatures I behold somewhat that minds <hi>me of duty,</hi> or of grace; the <hi>leaven, mustardseed, fishers net, seed, field, talents, oxen, farm;</hi> every thing may teach us somevvhat to contemplate God, or selfe in. It is said of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> as I remember, that he brought <hi>Philosophy</hi> down from <hi>heaven:</hi> what a far higher Art was that which our Saviour hath taught us, who hath brought up <hi>Divinity</hi> from the <hi>earth.</hi> Study this contemplative Divinity in the Book of the creatures.</p>

               <p>1 The first growth is at his conversion, which is a strange and supernatural growth, a growth <hi>per saltum,</hi> a translation from <hi>darknesse to light,</hi> from <hi>death</hi> to <hi>life,</hi> from a <hi>stone</hi> to <hi>flesh,</hi> from a <hi>thorn</hi> to a <hi>fir-tree,</hi> a <hi>bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar</hi> to a <hi>vine,</hi> or a branch of a <hi>wild Olive</hi> to a grafted bough in a <hi>right Olive.</hi> This is the <hi>greatest change</hi> in the world, far greater then that from Grace to Glory at death. <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> differ but gradually, as the <hi>morning light</hi> and <hi>noon day.</hi> But Nature and Grace do <hi>toto Coelo differre,</hi> as much as <hi>light</hi> and <hi>darkness.</hi>

               <p>The first <hi>Motive.</hi> This an Argument of Truth, how differs the <hi>living</hi> child from the <hi>dead,</hi> the <hi>Picture</hi> from a <hi>true</hi> man but in growth? Where you see not growth suspect truth.</p>
               <p>2 There is a <hi>Perfection</hi> attainable here. <hi>As many as are perfect, let us be thus mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> Phil. 3. 15. That is, 1.

perfectly; so must we be growing. All Natures works tend to it. The child grows first in <hi>stature,</hi> when no more in stature, then in <hi>strength;</hi> when no more in strength, then in <hi>judgment;</hi> when no more in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then in <hi>affection,</hi> then in <hi>Grace.</hi> Sin stayes not till it come to its <hi>unhappy perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> and shall Grace stop in the middle?

               <p>3 There is <hi>no perfection</hi> here; <hi>viz. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, Absolute, Complete.</hi> This contradicts not, but fortifies the former Motive. <hi>As ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of us as are perfect,</hi> Phil. 3. 15. yet <hi>ver.</hi> 12 he puts not himself into that number, <hi>I have not yet attained, I am not yet perfect;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow the harder after it.
