         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter I perceiued (very reuerend father)
that your good trauell amongeſt vs had
not ſo good ſucceſſe, as the vnfaithfull &amp;
ſuperfluous doinges of other ſometimes
doe obtaine, I not onely muſed with my
ſelfe what ſhould be the cauſe, but alſo ſtudied with
my whole indeuour to do that lay in me, though not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to helpe good affaires forward, yet at the leaſt, not
to hinder them. For certaine ouerthwart perſons (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding
to cleaue earneſtly vnto the faith of the church,
when in very deed they do nothing els but ſticke vnto
their owne wils in folowing euill cuſtome) coueted di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
wayes to obſcure the praiſe of your diligent labor.
Being moued thereto partly becauſe you examined the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
by the ſcriptures, and partly for that you gaue in your
viſitation iniunctions to take away the principall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
of ſuperſtitions, euen the altars of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
maſſe.</p>
            <p>Ah God helpe, to be tried by the Goſpel, vvas a
ſtrange matter vnto them that were occupied onely in
their pye portuaſe and ordinalles, but more ſtrange
vnto them that were woont to heare of nothing at viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
but of paying of mony, and moſt ſtrange vnto
them that were neuer examined before, not ſo much
as whether they beleeued in God or no.</p>
            <p>This vnwont maner &amp; ſtrangeneſſe made your godly
indeuors, of ſome not to be ſo thankfully receiued (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
of the honeſt moſt thankfully taken) as they woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely
deſerued of all: inſomuch that for my part I
hearkened for nothing but for ſome congratulation of
my brethren toward you: and the people looked for
<pb facs="tcp:26838:3"/>
reformation of enormities, for the open puniſhment
of great crime, and for the plaine ſetting forth of Gods
word &amp; preaching of the ſame after your viſitation. But
as I haue heard nothing of the one (honeſt perſons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted)
ſo do the people vvait ſtil for the other. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(to ſpeake ſimply) I thinke God recompenſeth
the omiſsion of the one vvith the loſſe of the other, for
praiſe hath beene vvont to follovv vertue, as the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovv

vvas cleane taken avvay. But hovv thankefully thoſe
things vvere then of ſome receiued, their ſetting forth
&amp; teaching of the ſame plainly ſhevved. I do vvell re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that many vvere as loth then to forgoe theyr
purgatory, as they be novv vnvvilling to take dovvne
their altars, the monuments of the ſame: &amp; that it was
as ſtrange a thing to ſay on Aſhvvedneſday <hi>Memento
homo, &amp;c.</hi> in Engliſh (notvvithſtanding the ſaid booke
of articles vvilling the ſame) as it is novv to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the Nevv teſtament by a godly biſhop. In the
ſame yere alſo came forth godly iniunctions comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
parents and gouernours to teach their youth the
Lords prayer, the Articles of the faith, &amp; the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of almighty God in English, vvhich themſelues
had not learned, &amp; therfore the curats vvere charged to
recite one clauſe or article one day, &amp; another on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
day of the ſame, vntill the vvhole vvere learned.
This yere likevviſe by the authority of the ſame iniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
the Bible, Gods booke vvas ſet vp in the quiere,
to be read both in Latine and English, vvhich thither
vvas ſo vvell vvelcome, ſo much regarded, and ſo dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
<pb facs="tcp:26838:3"/>
ſtudied, that he had good leaue to depart from
thence into the body of the church.</p>
            <p>For in the yeare of our Lord God 1538. the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
were faine to renew the ſame iniunctions and
ſpeake more plainely, who commanded the ſaid Gods
booke to bee ſet vp in ſome conuenient place in the
Church, and no man to be diſcouraged from reading
of the ſame in Engliſh. They charged all curates againe
to teach the Lordes praier, the articles of the faith, and
the commandementes of God, and that they ſhoulde
examine euerie perſon comming to auriculer confeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in the ſame, and heare them ſay the Lordes praier,
the articles &amp;c. particularly. And alſo make or cauſe to
be made one ſermon euerie quarter in euerie one of
their cures. O Lord God, what an eye ſore &amp; torment
of minde was this vnto them that were obſtinate and
wayward: but what a ſweete comforte to the ſimple
that were willing to disburden their conſcience? If god
had then, as he hath now, ſent vs ſome godly learned
Biſhops that vvoulde haue taken paines to viſite their
cures, and to haue examined howe theſe matters had
gone forward, they ſhould haue perceaued many a falſe
caſt to haue bin plaied vnder the couerlet in the ſhif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
houſes. And ſome ſimple folke woulde haue ſaide
that their ghoſtles fathers had giuen them counſell to
ſtick vnto their old primer, and to beware of the newe,
and ſpecially of the teſtament.</p>
            <p>Diuers proclamations about this time were alſo ſet
forth, concerning Gods matters, but alas they were ſo
vnwillingly handled, and ſo vnthankfully receaued, that
God had almoſt taken his word from vs againe. At the
length about the yeare of our Lord God 1544. the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages
were put forth in engliſh, which likewiſe were ſo
wel welcome to ſome that the kings maieſtie then was
conſtrained to write vnto certaine prelates concerning
the ſame, whome he aduertiſed, not to be ſo ſlacke in
putting the ſaid praiers in practiſe, as they were inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:26838:4"/>
forth his former articles &amp; iniunctions. Thus God
hath wrought among vs by a little and a litle to bring
vs to knowledge, that at the le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth vve might willingly
embrace his holy word. Againe, forſomuch as of late
Gods booke was in ſome places almoſt forgot, in ſome
places runne out of the church into the chancel to hide
himſelfe amongeſt the popiſh bookes, and of ſome ſo
ſafely laid vp, that a man might wright vpon him with
his finger, <hi>Ecce nunc in puluere dormio.</hi> Therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie
God moued the heart of our moſte naturall
liege Lord and dearely beloued mayden king, to lift vp
the ſame Gods booke once again out of the duſt. Who
in the yeare of our Lord God 1547. ſet foorth by hys
royall viſitation godly homilies, the paraphraſe of that
learned father <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> to the great comfort of the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that be willing to learne, &amp; alſo godly iniunctions,
meaning thereby to root vp all ſuperſtition, abuſe, and
idolatry, &amp; to ſet vp gods word in their place. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he commanded not onely to take awaie all ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and idolatrie, but to take away, and vtterly to
extinguiſh and deſtroy all monuments of ſuperſtition
&amp; idolatrie. cap. 28. But how diligently putoffes haue
practiſed their pollicie, to hinder this his godly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:
it is better to lament it with teares, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe
it in letters. Laſt of all, to put all out of doubt,
and to make a perfect concord, we haue a booke of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
praier with an order in the ſame for reading of
Gods booke ſet forth in Engliſh by the ſame aucthori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and ſtabliſhed by act of parliament. And leaſt anie
perſon would be ſo foolish &amp; mad to looke for the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
ragges againe, one ſtatute at the laſt parliament
abolisheth and condemneth for euer all other popish
bookes of the old ſeruice. Notwithſtanding ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
be yet daſed in thoſe Gods matters that they know
not vvhat to doe. Maruaile not therefore (deare fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
though the vngodly ſorte doe miſconſter, and
euill interpret your godly trauaile. For they crie for a
<pb facs="tcp:26838:4"/>
law, they muſt haue a law to lead them from euerie ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition
by name, els they vvill not obey. But if they
loued obedience, quietneſſe, and had but one ſparke of
reuerend feare either toward God or their prince, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
deſire of godly knovvledge, there hath inough and
inough againe bin ſaid, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning matters of religion,
and alſo ſet forth, both by order and law.</p>
            <p>There be articles inough, iniunctions inough, procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
inough, commandements inough, exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
inough, leſſons inough, and lavves inough, if they
vvere vnderſtoode, vvillingly embraced &amp; reuerently
obeyed. Albeit for them that be ſelf vvilled, frovvard,
contentious, obſtinat, &amp; dul harted, nothing vvil ſerue.
Therfore to none may be better applied this prophecy
of <hi>Eſay,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſay. 28.</note> then vnto theſe. Who ſaith, <hi>They that be ſuch

another commandement: after one rule, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rule: after one inſtruction, another inſtruction: there a
litle, &amp; there a litle. For he that ſpeaketh vnto this people,
is euen as one that vſeth rudeneſſe of ſpeeche, &amp; a ſtrange
language. If anie man ſay vnto them, loe, this is the reſt
wherwith ye may eaſe hym that is wearie, this is the refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing,
they will not harken. Therfore the word of the Lord,
leſſon vpon leſſon, commandement vppon commandement,
rule vpon rule, inſtruction vpon inſtruction, there a little,
and there a litle ſhalbe vnto them an occaſion of ſtumbling
that they may goe on, and fal backward, be bruſed, tangled,
and ſnared. Wherefore heare the worde of the Lord, yee
mockers, ye that haue rule of this people.</hi> O vvould God

to open vnto me by his holy ſpirit and vvorde, this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle:
<hi>credo eccleſiam &amp;c.</hi> vvith the right meaning of the
ſame according to the ſcriptures: I vvas as ſtiffe in the
popish traditions (taking them for good cuſtomes and
ceremonies of the fathers) as I am now earneſt in Gods
booke, and taught them vvith ſo good a zeale (but not
according to knovvledge) as I doe novv the Goſpell.
Wherefore taking of the ſame remedy vvherof I tooke
hurt, euen of <hi>Credo eccleſiam,</hi> as they that be hurt of
ſcorpions be vvoont to do, I can do no leſſe but vvrite
and ſet forth the ſame, vnto and for ſuch as be ſtoong
vvith the ſame ſting, and venomed vvith the ſame poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
Whoſe nature is, not to hurt but vvhere it findeth
bloud. No more <hi>Credo eccleſiam</hi> hurteth but ſuche as
cleaue too much to humaine reaſon and naturall vvit.
I truſt they vvill not miſlike that thing that loue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth
me to doe for their ſakes. If they doe, they
shall find me as readie to defend the ſame by the word
of god againſt all popish bablinges, as I haue bene to
vvrite it. So that your godly learning miſliketh it not,
vnto vvhome vvith all other godly learned, I humbly
ſubmit the ſame, beſeeching you to accept in good
part my ſmall induſtrie, as the firſt fruites of my pen
and iudge thereof as god shall put in your minde, to
vvhome be all thanke, praiſe and glory. <hi>Amen.</hi>

that Chriſt himſelfe had ſo appointed before. For when
Chriſt ſhould depart from the church, he promiſed to ſend
them the ſame holy Ghoſt,<note place="margin">Iohn. 14.</note> ſaying. <hi>The comforter which

            <p>Loe you ſee the wicked and vngodly haue the name of

And howe hath the deuill tranſformed himſelfe

got the titles of holy, and Catholicke, and his miniſters the
names of true ſhepheardes. Catholicke be the right clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

the Church of Ieſus Chriſt, which indeede is both holy
and catholicke. But in ſtead of the holy Catholick church,
they doe beleeue the Church of the wicked, in whoſe dregs
of deteſtable traditions and ceremonies, they haue bene
ouſted from their youth.</p>
            <p>Verely if they would ponder their wordes with halfe
indifferent iudgement, and behold them but with one of
their eyes, I thinke they would keepe ſilence, or elſe bluſhe

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to walke wilfully in errour and blindneſſe, when
their fathers wandered vnawares. And where they ſay,

            <p>The Church or kingdome of Antichriſt, is called the
<hi>man of ſinne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The man of ſinne.</note> becauſe it is builded vpon a ſinnefull man,
<pb facs="tcp:26838:9"/>
gouerned by a ſinfull man, inſtructed by euill ſinfull work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and their doctrine defended by the lawes and power
of ſinnefull men. Which tooke authoritie neyther of God,
nor of his worde, but of a monſtrous beaſt with many
heades, euen of the people that departed from the faith,
whereof the ſame holy ſpirite of God ſpeaketh, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecieth
more plainely by the mouth of <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaying: <hi>The
ſpirite ſpeaketh euidently,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.</note> 
               <hi>that in the latter times ſome
ſhall depart from the faith, and ſhall giue heede vnto
the ſpirites of error, and deuiliſh doctrines of them
which ſpeake falſe, thorow hypocriſie, and haue their
conſcience marked with an hote iron, forbidding to
marrie, and commaunding to abſtaine from meates
vvhich God hath created to be receaued vvith giuing
of thankes, of them which beleeue and knevve the
trueth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now ioyne theſe two prophecies together, and note di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
the cauſe, maner, increaſe, and force of Antichriſts
kingdome: and then it ſhall be the better perceaued.</p>
            <p>The cauſe why God permitteth the wicked to deceiue
the people,<note place="margin">The cauſe why God ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered error to raigne, and the wicked to rule.</note> was for that they did not receaue the law of the
trueth, but loathed Gods word when they had it. They
writ it not in their heartes, neither brought forth the fruits
of the ſpirite, but of the fleſh. To ſpeake all in one worde,
They had (as we haue) much godly teaching, and brought
foorth much vngodly liuing. Of verie duetie godly liuing
muſt followe godly teaching, otherwiſe Gods plague and
vengeance followeth his word, where and when ſoeuer it
be taught.</p>
            <p>But amongeſt all the plagues of God,<note place="margin">The greateſt plague of God.</note> this is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,
that he taketh away his word from the people, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
them to be fed with lies and Canterburie tales, or
fables. After which ſorte and maner the wicked haue come
and entered into the Chriſtian generation,<note place="margin">By lyes the wicked haue entered into the Church.</note> yea and haue
ſit in the holy place and ſeate of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> pretending to
teache the holy word of God. They haue ſet (I ſay) in the
<pb facs="tcp:26838:10"/>
ſeate of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> not by teaching the law and the prophets,
but by name and place. whereby the people not able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
the true ſeſſion from preſumptuous vſurpation haue
bene deceiued with falſe myracles, lying powers and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
            <p>By the which feates they haue increaſed and growne
into the greater number.<note place="margin">By falſe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles &amp; lying
powers, the wicked haue increaſed.</note> For when by the helpe of the
deuill, with their coniurations, charmes and diuers other
falſe fleightes, they wrought myracles and wonders in
diuers and ſundrie places. Then the people (regarding not
the ſimple word of God) forſooke their faith and ranne a
gadding from place to place, to gaze vpon ſignes and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
Manie beleeued lies, becauſe many taught lies. Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
powers were on their ſide, few durſt ſpeake the trueth,
and the ſimple lacked good inſtruction, ſome therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from the faith.</p>
            <p>The ſorce of Antichriſtes kingdome is well noted of
<hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">By force the wicked haue withſtood the trueth and ſet forth their owne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> in that hee ſaith his comming ſhalbe with all lying

            <p>Whoſoeuer denieth the death of Ieſus Chriſt to be a

the aforeſaid dragges and ſuch like to be expedient for

as men ſought remiſſion of ſinnes and Gods fauour in
ſuch phantaſticall deuiſes of men, it cannot be denyed, but
in ſo doing, they denied the Lord that bought them.</p>
            <p>To ſay trueth, men little remembred the oblation of
Chriſt by deathe vppon the croſſe. For not manie yeares
agone, euen when Maſſes ſatiſfactory floriſhed, to affirme
Chriſtes oblation by death vpon the croſſe once offered for
all, to be ſufficient for remiſſion of ſinnes to all them that
beleeue, was ſo farre out of memorie that it was counted
abhominable hereſie, becauſe Maſſe and it could not ſtand
together. In time of anguiſhe, trouble, or ſickeneſſe, was
Chriſtes death ſought to for quietneſſe of conſcience? No,

of them (iudging them more then men) and
thought all had bene well, whatſoeuer they had ſayde or

            <p>To keepe this their eſtimation in the peoples opinions,<note place="margin">The cauſe why Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates will not permit the mariages of prieſtes.</note>
they procured their champions to fight manfully with their
lawes and tormentes againſt the mariages of prieſtes. And
nowe that they doe perceaue that force will not ſerue them,
they priuily whiſper in the eares of the people that mariage
is whoredome and an vncleane life: Whereby they do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
all honeſt married perſons of adulterie, yet doe not
manie fooliſh people perceaue,<note place="margin">If marriage be not a cleane life, God is the author of vncleanneſſe, and Chriſt a bawd.</note> how they (that teache ſuch
hereſie and diueliſhe doctrine) goe about to lowt them in
their liuing. For they are not aſhamed to make God the
author of vncleanneſſe, to accuſe Chriſt of bawdrie, and to
condemne all men of ſinne, ſo that themſelues might ſtill be
counted angels, and not men.</p>
            <p>This do all they that ſpeake thus euilly of matrimony,
Whereof God himſelfe was the author. And Chriſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
it both by his corporall preſence,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. Math. 19. Iohn. 2.</note> and firſt myracle
turning water into wine: whereby he declared, that the wel
alowed matrimonie and condemned adulterie.</p>
            <p>But theſe fellowes diſalowing Gods inſtitution, and
aduaunſing their owne inuention, turne wine into water
contrary vnto Chriſt, that is to ſay, They diſhonour holy
matrimonie,<note place="margin">Vnto God matrimonie is ſweete, But vnto Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is holy.</note> which is ſweete and pleaſant in the ſight of
God, and make much of ſtincking adulterie euer abhorred
and condemned of God and all good men. They admit ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an harlot for money diſpenſed withall contrarie to the
commandementes of God, then a wife according to Gods
ſcriptures,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.</note> which ſayth, <hi>If they cannot abſtaine, let them
<pb facs="tcp:26838:12"/>
marrie,</hi> yea ſome of them are not aſhamed to ſay that it is
more lawfull for a prieſt to haue ſix whores then one wife.
And ſome alſo pretend ſo good fellowſhip, that they would
ſooner lend their owne wiues (they ſay) vnto the Prieſt,
then to grant that he ſhuld marrie. Alſo they count it a deed
of charitie, and a good worke to make a prieſt a cookold,
(as they terme it) and in ſo doing, they think to pleaſe God
and doe him good ſeruice.</p>
            <p>Whether a man might beleeue them in theſe their
ſayinges without an othe.<note place="margin">Antichriſtes prelates doe hope by the increaſing of ſinne, to bring the word of God in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and them ſelues in eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> I leaue it for other men to
iudge. Of this I am ſure, that this their cupſhot doctrine
brawled in their conuenticles, and whiſpered in corners,
their liberall fellowſhip, and good worke that proceedeth of
their burning concupiſcenſe, &amp; not of charitie, hath brought
in the contempt and violating of holy matrimonie, and the
people to a wonderfull looſeneſſe of liuing. Wherein they
ioy not a little, thinking it to be a good meane to ſet them
vp againe like Gods in mens conſciences. But in the

to the prophecie of <hi>Paul</hi> before ſaid,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.</note> in that they doe

            <p>Alſo, who hath brought in ſo manie ſectes into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world

            <p>If you aſke me to what purpoſe this rable ſerueth, and

may be more truely ſpoken, as followeth. <hi>They ſtretche
forth their mouth vnto heauen, and there toonge goeth

Beholde theſe ſinfull and wealthie men in the world,

            <p>What prouder thinges can be ſaide, than to affirme
that they can with fine words create their creator of a peece

they haue done. Whereby they haue ſucked no ſmall lucre
and game from the people. But their lucre beginneth now
to decay, and their idle life is perceaued to be vnnereſſary.
Which idle life, the God that they doe make hath and muſt
maintaine, or els they will perceiue their ſtate cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine.
This maketh them to be ſo ſtiffe necked againſt the
ſetting forth of Gods worde, and againſt the right admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
of the ſacramentes. This maketh them to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die

Ieſus Chriſt, If there bee anie conſolation in Chriſt,
If there bee any comforte of loue, If there bee anie

and mercie: Let them halt no longer on both partes: Let
them blow no longer hote and cold: But let them make the
tree good and his fruites good, or els make the tree euill
and his fruite euill. To ſpeake plainely vnto them, Let
them not make a mingle mangle, and hodge podge of the
Lordes ſupper anie longer. But let them miniſter it ſimply
and plainly at the Lordes table, as Chriſt hath left it, and
<pb facs="tcp:26838:13"/>
as the booke of Scriptures doe truely meane, and not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their olde popiſh faſhion as they doe, making it a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for ſinnes both of quicke and dead, offering it at buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alles,

               <note place="margin">Dan. 9.</note> For as the

            <p>Alſo by his maieſties iniunctions chap. 28. the altar of

as it is a monument of the ſuperſtition of the popiſh maſſe.
So that, for anie thing I can perceaue, they that ſo fayne
would holde vp their altars againſt them that goe about to
put them downe, both by law and order, meane none other
thing but to maintain a monument of ſuperſtition and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie

Ah where was this their God before the altar and altar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
was made? This may well be that God vnto whome
they thinke to doe good ſeruice in breaking of wedlock and
rayling againſt marriage, but ſure I am, that this is not
that God that made both heauen and earth and all thinges
in them, becauſe the altar and the altar-ſtone be ſome
thinges. Albeit, leaſt perhappes they ſhould thinke that
I would onely anſwere them with ſcoffes (though theyr
ſhameleſſe obſtinacie deſerueth none other) I will rehearſe
a few wordes out of Gods booke to ſtoppe their mouthes
withall. And when they haue anſwered and truely confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them, I will forſake Gods booke and the chriſtian
faith, as truely as I haue forſaken them, and all their
iugling caſtes. In the 7. Chapter to the <hi>Hebrues,</hi> it is
written. <hi>The Lord ſware and will not repent. Thou art

            <p>This is the better teſtament that Ieſus Chriſt hath ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed

            <p>By theſe Scriptures wee may conclude that Ieſus

our redemption,<note place="margin">Chriſt made a perfect obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſinnes once, and that vppon the croſſe, and not vpon an altar.</note> made a full,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.</note> perfite and ſufficient ſacrifice,

               <hi>This article hath the holy ghoſt ſo ſurely graued in our
heartes and written in our minds that wee cannot but ſay.
We beleue the remiſſion of ſinnes. Which alſo is ſurely
grounded vppon Gods holy word, that ſayth:</hi> This is the
teſtament that I will make vnto them,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 16. 17. 18.</note> after thoſe daies
(<hi>ſaith the Lord</hi>) I will put my lawes in their hearts, and
in their mindes will I write them, and their ſinnes and
iniquities will I remember no more. And where remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of theſe things is, there is no more offering for ſin.</p>
            <p>So long as the ſacrifice and offering for ſinnes,<note place="margin">How long the altars ought to haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.</note> tooke
not away ſinnes, neither brought perfect remiſſion of ſins,
there remained in the Church of God altars, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
ſacrifice or oblation for ſinnes.</p>
            <p>But when Chriſt had once offered himſelfe vppon the
croſſe by death, and by that his one oblation once offered,
had obtained remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſinnes, and finiſhed all things that
was due for man to pay: ſaying, <hi>It is finiſhed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 19. 30.</note> giuing vp
the Ghoſt, thorough the which eternall ſpirite hee gaue
himſelfe to God without ſpot,<note place="margin">Heb. 9</note> 
               <hi>in a ſweet ſauour.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.</note> Then
was finiſhed (according to his owne ſaying) a perfect ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crifice

ſacrifice and oblations for ſinnes totally ended, as it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid.
Where remiſſion of ſinnes and iniquities is, there
is no more offering for ſinne: if no offering for ſinnes, then
no altar to offer vpon. Therefore either let them prooue
Gods word to be falſe, that ſaith, <hi>Where remiſsion of,
&amp;c.</hi> the Holy ghoſt a liar, that promiſed to write the ſame
in our hearts, &amp;c. and take away this article of our faith,
<hi>I beleeue the remiſsion of ſinnes:</hi> or elſe away with their
altars and oblations vpon the ſame: I meane their mony
ſacrifice, the maſſe.</p>
            <p>Which altar and ſacrifice be nothing elſe but witneſſes
of their infidelitie,<note place="margin">What the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for ſinne now doe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie.</note> idolatrie, and Iewiſh hearts. Of their
infidelitie, in that they do not beleeue remiſſion of ſinnes,
through the onely oblation of Chriſt once offered vpon the
croſſe. Of their idolatrie, in that they ſet vp another ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb facs="tcp:26838:15"/>
and propitiation for ſinnes then God hath appoynted,
Wherein ſurely they ſhewe themſelues to bee more than
Iewiſh. For in their ſacrificing and maſſing they denie
Chriſtes death and reproue God of periurie. The prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
of Chriſtes death is this:<note place="margin">Eſay. 53.</note> 
               <hi>With his ſtripes we are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi>
By his paines and merites our paines are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
(as touching damnation) and our ſinnes couered. Or
by his death wee are healed from eternall death. By hys
oblation our ſinnes are healed, for hee hath purchaſed vs
perfect remiſſion of the ſame. But this hath he not done, if
there be anie ſinnes taken away by the maſſe, The which
ſinnes at the leaſt he left vnhealed. And therefore hee hath
not (if this be true) as yet ſuffered. For heauen and earth
ſhall faile, before theſe wordes be falſe. <hi>With his ſtripes
we are healed.</hi> Or by his death our ſinnes are forgiuen.
<hi>Ergo</hi> he hath ſuffered, and we wholly healed. Or els if we
be not wholly healed, he hath not yet ſuffered.</p>
            <p>Againe, almightie God promiſed with an othe vnto hys
ſonne Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 17.</note> ſaying: <hi>Thou art a prieſt for euer.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 10. 4.</note>
That is to ſay, Ieſus Chriſt hath offered himſelfe vppon
the croſſe by death vnto God the father once. And by that
one oblation once offered, hee hath made perfect for euer
them that are ſanctified, as it is before by the ſcriptures
euidently proued. For this one oblation once offered per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
for euer. Ieſus Chriſt is called and is indeede a <hi>Prieſt
for euer.</hi> Whoſe ſweet oblation remaineth in the boſome
of God to our great comfort for euer. But he himſelf now
offereth no more, for he denieth no more, <hi>but liueth for
euer on the right hand of God the father, making in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſsion
for vs.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 8.</note> Seeing then his oblation is perfect for
euer, ſerueth for euer, and hee himſelfe making interceſſion
for vs, liueth for euer: He is therefore (according to the othe
of God) Prieſt for euer. But this hee were not, if it could
bee proued that his oblation were vnperfect, as it muſt
needes be, if monie ſacrifice, the maſſe obtaineth remiſſion
of ſinnes or anie part thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:26838:15"/>
By theſe fewe Scriptures and ſayings grounded vpon
the ſame, it madifeſtly appeareth howe blaſphemous the
money ſacrifice, the maſſe is. Namely, it robbeth vs of
our moſt comfortable articles of our faith, which is, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
the remiſſion of ſinnes: it taketh away the veritie of
Gods Scriptures, which doe proue Chriſts oblation vpon
the Croſſe to bee perfect, whole, and ſufficient, it maketh
Chriſt a lyer when he ſayd, <hi>It is finiſhed.</hi> It adnihillateth
his merites,<note place="margin">To maintaine the maſſe and altars is great blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie and abhominable hereſie.</note> and taketh away his paſſion from vs, and it
condemneth God of periurie. If there can bee any great
blaſphemous, and more abominable hereſies then theſe, let
all the world iudge. Of all the which, the popiſh altar is a
monument, and (as it were) an hand to leade the people
vnto, from Chriſt and his merites: wherefore all good men
hauing but one ſparke of grace with knowledge, will not
onely be content with the taking downe of them, but alſo
will (I trowe) helpe the beſt they can, euery one according
to his vocation, to the ſame.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, if the money ſacrifice, the maſſe, had bene ſo
neceſſarie, and vnto God ſo acceptable, as the people haue
beleeued it to be, woulde Chriſt haue giuen no commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereof, no example of it, no word concerning it, what
not one word?</p>

what ſhould be the cauſe thereof. At whome I doe not a

haroweth, nor ſoweth it: what marueile is it though it
bring him no corne, but weedes? England is but yet fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
with the plough of Gods word, yet ſcant fallowed,
what marueile is it then, that weedes growe faſter then
the corne? It muſt needes be ſo, vnleſſe Gods worde be
better ſowne. For manie that ſhoulde will not: A fewe
would and cannot: and ſome that can, may not, becauſe they
that ſhould will not. To remedie it, albeit I know: I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
but this I know and am ſure of. <hi>Where the worde of

            <p>Of maſſe, we haue not ſo much as one tote or title of
God, Chriſt, or his Apoſtles giuen vs. Notwithſtanding
how haue the people cared for Maſſe, Maſſe, Maſſe, onely
with Maſſe they haue bene ſatiſfied. Why doe they not cry
now as much for preaching of the worde of God: without
the which, they periſh? Nay, why doe they crie ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

haue they made ſince their maſſe decayed? what lyes haue
theſe idle braines inuented, what ſlanders haue they imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

            <p>No doubt, as the deuill brought vp his Church at the

vphold, maintaine, and defend the ſame. That is, not by

therefore in this matter, and to looke backe, is to be

in them, is in poſſeſſion of the other, and he that is out of

Chriſt calleth this a great faith. Verily it ſo great that it

the ſecond thing that faith worketh in vs. That faith brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth

the third thing that faith worketh in vs, and therfore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
<hi>Not that onely, but alſo we reioyce in tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
knowing that tribulation bringeth patience, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

which is giuen vnto vs.</hi> No thanke then vnto our faith, no

            <p>Fayth that worketh by loue is much worth before God,<note place="margin">Loue.</note>
which loue is the ſecond note of the holy Catholike church:<note place="margin">Gal. 5.</note>

ſo loued vs, that hee gaue his onely begotten ſonne Ieſus

               <hi>Walke in loue euen as Chriſt loued vs, and gaue

               <hi>A newe

as I haue loued you.</hi> Ieſus Chriſt ſo loued vs, that
he gaue himſelfe for vs, for he was obedient vnto God the
father for vs vnto death, yea vnto death vpon the croſſe.
This loue ſo warmeth the heart with hope and aſſurance
of euerlaſting life (<hi>for we are ſaued by hope</hi>) that it put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
away all ſeruile feare:<note place="margin">Hope &amp; feare.</note> I ſay not all feare,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> for there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
and abideth in the heart an holy reuerend feare or
dread of diſpleaſing God, or lothneſſe to looſe God and his
holy ſpirit, which if a man taſte, is rather a reuerend ioy,
and a glad loue than feare: therefore is it truely ſaid, <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
loue caſteth out feare,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Iohn 4.</note> that is to ſay, Ieſus Chriſt by
his holy ſpirit poſſeſſing the heart of man through fayth,
pntteth cleane away the feare of ſhame, loſſe of goodes or
friends, the feare of torments, enemies, and priſonment, yea
the feare of ſinne,<note place="margin">The office of true faith.</note> death, the deuill and hell. So that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

of ſinne, that cauſed Chriſt to die, but it alſo bringeth
vs Ieſus Chriſt the attonement maker betweene God and
vs for our ſinne, whereof commeth loue. In the which loue
is manifeſt the third note of the holy Catholike church,<note place="margin">The ſpirit of Chriſt.</note> for
now we feare God no more as a terrible iudge, but tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
his holy ſpirit we loue him as a moſt gentle &amp; louing
father, whereof ſpeaketh Paule, ſaying thus: <hi>Ye haue not
receiued the ſpirit of bondage to feare any more, but
you haue receiued the ſpirit of adoption,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> 
               <hi>whereby we
crie, Abba, Father.</hi> Abba is as much in Engliſh as Dad,
or Deare father: it is the Syrian ſpeech, left vntranſlated
both by the Latine men, &amp; alſo Engliſh men, to the intent
(I ſuppoſe) that it ſhould alſo be Engliſh: for this I know,
that the firſt word that an Engliſh Chriſtian childe begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to ſpeake, is Abba, commonly, long before he can
ſpeake any thing elſe, which Chriſtian babe in his innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie

that faith, loue, and the ſpirit of God doe go together, and
be together in euery true Chriſtian as ſure notes and ſeales
of his ſaluation. Faith entring the gate of ſaluation, ſtic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
to the word of God, and taketh it onely to be the rule
of life and doctrine. Loue cleaueth vnto Chriſt, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
faith knowen, as the fruits do the tree, and putteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
feare. The ſpirit of God quieteth the conſcience, and
bringeth with a reuerend dread, ioy and gladneſſe ineffable.
If you know this, you be a very true member of the holy
Catholike church, and in the ſtrait gate and narrow way
vnto eternall life. If you know not this, I ſay no more but
God haue mercy vppon you:<note place="margin">Math. 7.</note>

And a little after, he ſpeaking of himſelfe and other of the

certifieth a mans conſcience that he is the childe of God,
then hee may be ſure that hee is of the church of Chriſt.

that whereſoeuer this goſpel is ſet forth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mother toong

himſelfe, then hee ſeeketh out his truſtie friendes and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

rayſed ſuch tragedies, then they would (diſburdening
themſelues) lay it to Chriſtes charge and to his holy word,

The wicked hating the Goſpel, haue ſtirred vprores and
vnquietneſſe amongeſt the people, and then they haue bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened

<pb facs="tcp:26838:25"/>
and call to memorie their maiſters firſt promiſe and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
which is written. Where he ſaith: <hi>Bleſſed are they
that ſuffer perſecution for righteouſnes ſake, for theirs
is the kingdome of heauen.</hi> To ſuffer for righteouſneſſe
and truthes ſake (me thinketh) muſt be a ſigne of the elect
of God. For they verily y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> do liue immofluely in the world,
and charitably with their neighbours, and notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
be hated, euill ſpoken of, ſtandered, and perſecuted of
the wicked, onely for ſpeaking againſt ſinne and iniquitie,
and for the Goſpels ſake, haue great cauſe to ioy in their
trouble and perſecution, as it ſolloweth.</p>
            <p>Bleſsed are yee vvhen men shal ſpeake euil of you,
and perſecute you, and shal ſpeake all euil againſt you,
lying, for my ſake. Reioyce yee and be glad, for plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
is your revvarde in heauen <hi>Loe this is the Churche
that cannot erre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I haue deſcribed before your eies both the church
of Antichriſt, which cannot but erre, and alſo the Church of
Ieſus Chriſt that cannot erre, plainly, with their ſignes
and notes: Note them therefore circumſpectly. The church
of Antichriſt is not ſtabliſhed vppon the veritie of Gods
worde and ſpirite, which is the ſure foundation of the holy
catholicke Church, but vpon a ſinful man, <hi>quia omnis homo
mendax,</hi> becauſe euerieman is a lyer. Chriſtes Churche
hath one iuſtifiyng faith which worketh by loue, for the
which Antichriſtes Church hath manie faithes, as, a little
faith, a ſmale faith, an vnperfect faith, a deceiuing fayth, a
ſick faith, and a dead faith, Dominikes faith, Baſils fayth
Auſtens faith, Bennets faith, Bernardes faith, Frances
faith, and Deuils faith. All which may enter the wide gates
and be admitted into the popes Church, and pertaker of
his mony ſacrifices. Where note they be the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
which thing maketh them bolde to perſecute the few
and ſmall flocke that entreth the ſtraite gate of fayth, and
walketh the narrow way of the Goſpel, which ſmall flock
neuer perſecuteth. For it is againſt the nature of a lambe
<pb facs="tcp:26838:26"/>
to ſucke the bloud of a Woolfe. It is the propertie of the
Woolfe to ſucke bloud, deuour and perſecute.</p>
            <p>The church of Ieſus Chriſt euer ſuffereth, loueth, and
prayeth for enemies and perſecutours.</p>
            <p>Antichriſte brood do murmure, hate, &amp; perſecute, with
a filthy conſcience.</p>
            <p>Vnto the church of Ieſus Chriſt onely Gods booke is
a perfect rule of beliefe, life, and doctrine, in ſtead whereof
Antichriſts generation hath many books and rules, as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
decrees and decretals, fathers, coumels, holy doctours,
<hi>Feſtiuale, Legenda aurea, Auſtens</hi> rule, <hi>Benets</hi> rule, <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils</hi>
rule, <hi>Bernards</hi> rule, <hi>Dominiks</hi> rule, <hi>Francis</hi> rule, and
now laſt of all Canterbury tales with a dung-cart ſul alſo
of vnwritten verites. Theſe haue beene brought in, and
taught by the ſpirits of errour, the very guides &amp; ſtayes of
Antichriſts church, &amp; therfore they could not but erre. But
the church of Ieſus Chr<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt, &amp; euery member of the ſame,
is gouerned with one ſpirit of trueth that cannot lie,
therefore cannot they erre, euen with the ſpirit of
Chriſt, the holy ghoſt, vnto whom, with
the father, and the ſome, be all
thanks, laud, praiſe
and glorie.
<hi>Amen.</hi>
