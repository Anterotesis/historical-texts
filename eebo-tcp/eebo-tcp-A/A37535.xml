            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis briefe but pithy discourse concerning

            <head type="sub">The Preface.</head>
            <p>I Discourse not of Play as some gowne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
have done of forren Wars, or
discoveries, who, never travelled out
of their studies to see either, but speake
upon other mens knowledge and fidelity,
which must needs weaken their credit, but
what I write comes all within the spheare,
and compasse of my own knowledge and
observations; I write nothing but as the
Poet, sayes <hi>quae<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> ipse miscrrima vidi et quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
pars magna fui</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore justly challenge the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
acceptations and beliefe. But here may
be objected that my own particular losses
may make me more bitter, and satyricall
then the case requires.</p>
            <p>To this I answer, that I have not lost any
so great summes either of mony, credit,
or times, as to sharpen my pen, either to
passion or invection, neither doth the
vexation of any late received losses, strive
to vent, and evaporate it selfe into a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58534:4"/>
but I write upon an even and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
temper void both of prejudice and
passion; one onely caution I will adde,
that you must not expect any flourishes
of wit or eloquence, for those are proper
to workes of fancy, and imaginations,
but this is a work onely of observations
<unclear>and</unclear> experience, and therefore I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
nothing but truth. Play was first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
for the recreation of mans minde,
and the refreshing of his spirits, having
bin tyred and spent with any serious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
that so being as it were a bowe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent,
they might recover their former
strength and vigor; certainly in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
moderate recreation is not onely
allowable, but commendable; being of
the same use (though in an inferior de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree)
as rest, sleep, or meat. But your
sensuallity easily suffers it self to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by vice, and that is turned to an
ill habit, which was first intended for a
lawfull exercise, so that Play when it
breakes this rule and passeth beyond its
due bounds, being no longer <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> not recreation but a profession, it
is infancy, wickednesse, theft; being sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
unattended by these attributes. I
speak then of professed gamesters who
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58534:4"/>
spend their whole time and faculties
therein, as in a trade or office; for when
Play growes to this excesse, it is so far
from good, that it loseth all similitude
or resemblance of good, for most vices
want not a colour and likenesse of some
good to shadow and palliate themselves.</p>
            <p>Saepelatet vitium proximitate boni.</p>
            <p>As covetousnesse hath a resemblance of
thrift, prodigality of bountie, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of mirth, and gaming of recreation,
that nothing can cause greater anxiety or
vexation: what broken sleepes, what
raving passions, both of body and minde,
what secret gnawing, and fretting discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
doth it procure: so that (as I sayed
before) losing this name of recreation,
it loses all likelihood and similitude of
good. To define then what play is (not
in the concrete, for so it is a mixture of
almost all vices but in the abstract)
Gaming is an evil from which arises a
most certain losse, and this losse is three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,
of time, of credit, of money; the
first and second unavoidable, the last on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
casuall but rashly avoided: these three
losses have a respective relation to the
three parts of man his soul, his person,
his Estate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:58534:5"/>
To begin with the first, and most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable
losse, which is of time; being
the greatest losse, both in respect of it self,
as (being rightly considered) the most
precious, of all other things, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of what it hath relation unto, the
soul being the most pretious part of man.
It cannot but seem a paradox to set this
losse of time in the first place, as the
greatest and most important, because it
is so far from being accounted so by the
lovers of Play, that the meere purpose
and resolution of losing time is often
the cause of all their other losses, is it not
their ordinary question, how shall we
spend the time? it being thought a matter
of that little worth and value, that it seems
rather a thing troublesome, and tedious,
so that men do even study how to cast it
away.</p>
            <p>At so low a rate is this inestimable
jewell prized. But how happens it, that
time if it be so precious, comes to be so
neglected and undervalued. Certainly it
proceeds only from ignorance: for the
use of time is onely to attain to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
now there being that antipathie
between knowledge and ignorance, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is not only despised, but the means
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58534:5"/>
also of attaining it, which is time: so
that time to the ignorant, is as pearl to
swine; they know not the value of it, and
therefore trample it under foot; but that
it is otherwise esteemed by those who
know the use of it, the practice and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of all learned men will easily
evince. It is the saying of a heathen, and
spoken to the shame and scandall of most
Christians; <hi>Conteritur vita inter errores
brevis, etia<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fi dies noctesque bonae menti la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boremus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our life is consumed in errors, even too
short, though we should labour day and
night in the ornament of our mindes; it
was the complaint of another, <hi>Ars
<unclear>longa</unclear>, vita brevis,</hi> that our life is too short,
for the attaining to the perfection of any
of the liberall Arts. Had those heathens
but known the great Art which our great
Schoolmen dayly teach us, the Art of
living and dying well, an Art that can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be too through learned, nor suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
practiced, how carefully would they
have husbanded every minute of their
lives. But so farre are our Gamesters
from learning or practicing this Arte,
that if happily before their falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this vice, they had learned any part
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58534:6"/>
part thereof, they now learn and practice
to forget it, so that they bring upon
themselves that curse which our Saviour
denounces in another case, from them, that
have not shall be taken away even what
they have. Of the little time that is lent
us, half or more is spent in the necessary
service of the body, for the other moytie,
few there are who do therein what they
should do: many who do nothing at all,
and most who do what they should not
do, and of this sort are gamsters: and I
dare say there is no man who hath wit
enough to play, but hath wit enough to
know he should not play, being forced
in his conscience to say with the Poet:
<hi>Video meliora proboque, deteriora sequor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly for this talent of time that
God hath lent us, he will call us, he will
call us to an accompt, and if the servant
that brought his talent in a napkin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any improvement were cast into utter
darknesse: what shall become of him
who not only improves not his talent, but
brings not to his Lord so much as his own
again, having wasted it upon his lusts and
pleasures? And this certainly is the only
accompt that most of our Gamsters can
give either of their talent of time, or
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58534:6"/>
money; I am unwilling to lose time,
in lamenting the losse of time, but the
losse is so inestimable, and yet so little
esteemed off, that it cannot be too much
lamented.</p>
            <p>To passe then to the second losse, arising
from Play, which is credit, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
respects the second part of man his
person. The word credit, as we use it, is
of some latitude and admits a threefold
Construction, first the report, sufferage,
or opinion which the world conceives of
any man, more properly and strictly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
good name or reputation, secondly
that trust or confidence which one man
hath in an others honest dealing and good
courage; thirdly a mixt credit, having a
relation both to a mans person and estate,
as for what summes a mans word or bonds
may be taken. Take then credit severally
or joyntly, in all these sences, and a
Gamester forfeites it in them all: first, for
reputation or good name, doth not the
very name of Gamester stinck in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils
of all honest men: although unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
by any of its ordinary attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
as cheating, lying, blaspheming,
and the like. <hi>Tully</hi> when he declamed
against <hi>Catiline,</hi> objecteth as one of his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58534:7"/>
greatest crimes that he did <hi>
                  <unclear>ale</unclear>à pernoctari:</hi>
and the Synod of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

sit quidem clericus, deponatur, si laicus segre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many are the Councels Cannons:
and Statutes of this and other Realmes
to forbid it, yea even <hi>Mahomet</hi> himselfe,
in his <hi>Alcaron,</hi> who otherwise allowed all
sensuallity.</p>
            <p>Judge then whether the bare name of a
Gamester be not of it selfe sufficient to
blast any mans reputation.</p>
            <p>Take then credit in the second sence,
for trust or confidence reposed by one
man in another, which also is of three
sorts: either of a Prince to his subject, of a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58534:7"/>
father to his sonne or a Master to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>
            <p>For the first, how unfit Gamsters are for
the managing any affaires of Estate, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
omit two notable examples of the
ancients.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chilon</hi> being sent from <hi>Lacedemon</hi> to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi>
to Treat of a league between these
two Commonwealthes, and finding the
Rulers Playing at Dice, returned without
speaking of his Commission, saying, that
he would not staine the glory of the <hi>
                  <unclear>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</unclear>,</hi>
with so great Ignominy, as to joyne
them in society with Gamsters. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
was a law amongst the <hi>Thebans,</hi> that
Merchants should not have to doe in the
Government of the Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>And if Merchants were forbidden,
consequently Gamesters who are the
meanest sort of Merchant adventurers,
and I am sure the reasons my Author
gives serve better against Gamsters then
any other Merchants. <hi>Primam quia Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suetudine,
&amp; inclinatione avari ideo que fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile,
publicam rem in suam vertune.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Quia parum magnanimi &amp; splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didi,
&amp; ut ait</hi> Aristoteles <hi>parum generosa
hac ratio vitae, &amp; virtnti adversa Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58534:8"/>
quia in publica persona authoritatem
inminuit.</hi> First because, by custom and
inclination they are covetous, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
apt to convert the publique wealth to
their own private secondly, because they
are seldom nobly minded, and as <hi>Aristotle</hi>
saith, this course of life is nothing gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and is repugnant to vertue thirdly,
because in a publique person it diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
authority: for the second sort of trust,
which is from a father to his son: what
wise Parent will trust a son either with the
fruition of a present or the possibility of
a future estate, whom he sees addicted to
Gaming, unlesse he be willing to behold
the utter subversion and ruine of his
family and estate, and the fruit of all his
labours and cares vanish into nothing.</p>
            <p>This I need not seek to proove, so many
wofull examples make it to manifest and
nourious.</p>
            <p>For the third sort of trust which is of a
Master to his servant, what Master would
give bread to a servant that is a Gamester,
for if he manage his Masters affairs and
have either money of his in his hands, or
other his goods committed to his charge,
and that he chance to lose his own, he
will play upon his Masters purse hoping
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58534:8"/>
to recover himselfe, and if peradventure
he continue still on the losing hand, and
hath not where withall to pay, he runs
himselfe into greater danger then before,
hoping that luck will turn and so come to
relieve his losses: But say he is not trusted
with any thing of his Masters, nor hath
ought of his to lose, yet it is not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
that he should assist at these houres
when he ought to give attendance, nor will
he be in the way to be found, when need
requires.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the second sort of credit,
which is a trust or confidence reposed by
one man in another, and is threefold; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from a Soveraigne, to a subject, a
Father to a son, or a Master, to a servant,
of all which a Gamester makes himselfe
uncapable.</p>
            <p>The third sort of credit, which is for
what sums a man may be trusted either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
word or bond comes now to be spoken
of: A gamester certainly of all men is
most unfit to be trusted, because his estate
is so uncertain, for though it be never so
great this day, it may be nothing to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;
as the Poet said well.</p>
            <p>Quem dies vidit veniens superbum, hunc
dies vidit fugiens jacentem.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:58534:9"/>
A gamester is <hi>homo fluxae fidei</hi> a man of a
fleeting credit, and as <hi>Iacob</hi> said of his
first born <hi>Reuben,</hi> is like the waves of the
sea, which as they are either raised into
mountaines or sunk into vallyes by every
gust of winde: so is a Gamesters Estate,
and credit by every gust of fortune.</p>
            <p>Again, a Gamester resembles the waves
of the sea in another property, for natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they are alwayes either ebbing or flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
so is a Gamesters Estate and credit,
though with this difference, that in the sea
after a ebb, constantly follows a flood, but
a Gamesters Estate commonly ebs many
times before it flowes once.</p>
            <p>Again, no man will take the word of a
Ward or I<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eot, though their Estates be
responsible, because they are under their
Guardians; thus fares it with Gamesters,
who make themselves wards to fortune,
giving over the managing and disposing
of their whole Estates to this their god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse
guardian, who commonly deales as ill
with them as any guardian the King or
Law imposeth. Thus have I run over the
second generall and unavoydable losse ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
from Play which is of credit, and
principally hath relation to the second
part of man: his person.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:58534:9"/>
To passe then to the third losse spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from Play, which is of money, and
principally respects a mans Estate, though
I have before noted it, as only casuall,
yet so great an ods there is that where one
man hath raised or augmented their estates
by Play, more then an hundred have ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
ruined themselves: I speak here of
Gentlemen who either have present, or are
heires to future Estates, not of those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
cheaters who like robbers upon the
spoiles and ruine of the Commonwealth,
this affection of mine though it may seem
strange, yet is it confirmed by dayly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
and if rightly considered stands
not without good reason. The first and
chiefest reason of which I shall have more
occasion to speak of hereafter, is the want
of Gods blessing upon money so ill got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
            <p>2. Because great store of money is
as a lure to draw together all the birds of
prey, so that if a man of Estate be addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Play though he understand the ways
thereof never so well, yet so many Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems,
plots and traps, will be layed to
insnare him, that it is impossible to escape
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:58534:10"/>
Thirdly because men that are either of
good parts or Estates and have any nobler
thing then Play to busie their wits, or set
their mindes on work, Play upon great
disadvantage with those whose wits stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and faculties, are onely bent that
way.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Because men of quality have
alwayes some respect to their reputation,
and having lost any reasonable sum will
rather let it goe, then seek any indirect
meanes for the regaining it, whereas needy
Gamesters having little or no credit, upon
losse, will not forbear any shift though
never so base, or unworthy for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of their losses.</p>
            <p>5. And lastly winning commonly brings
a man into a vein of great expence, and
drawes together many needy persons to
attend on him, for money that comes so
lightly, goes as lightly; but upon losse no
body will either help him or pity him,
for losses that come by a mans own neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
or folly (as loss by play doth) are less
compassionated, then those that come by
casualty; and here I cannot but relate a
story of mine observation, which I think
wil not be impertinent. I was wont to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58534:10"/>
a Gent. to the house of a great
Lady, where commonly meeting other
company they fell to play, the Gentleman
upon winning was very free and open
handed to the servants, so that if they
sat up all night, not a servant would go to
bed, but when they broke up Play, the
Butlers would be ready to present him
with wine or beere, the Pages and Lackies
one would hold up the hanging, another
hold open the door, another light him
down the staires, and be ready to do all
offices expecting their reward.</p>
            <p>But if the Gentleman were a looser, and
like to continue so, they all get them to
bed, and he might stumble and break his
neck down the staires, for any help he
should have of them, not one of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be seen, making good that of the
Poet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nullus ad amissas ibit amicus opes,</hi> so
that a mans winnings are as it were in <unclear>jest</unclear>,
but his losses alwayes prove in earnest.</p>
            <p>The examples of families and Estates
ruined by Play so far confirm this that (I
verily beleeve) that all others of expence
layed together have not bin the overthrow
of so many Houses as Play alone. I have
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58534:11"/>
observed these five ordinary wayes of
wasting mens Estates: drink, Women,
Carlesnesse, great expence, Gaming, not
mentioning those Casualties which are
unavoidable and proceed not through a
mans own neglect, as losse by fire, losse
by Sea, Law Suites, and the like, but
to speak of these five which proceed from
a mans own folly.</p>
            <p>First, as for drink no great Estate was
ever spent therein, without the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of some other vice, it being ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
prejudiciall to the body then the
Estate.</p>
            <p>For Women 'tis certain they have been
the ruine of many houses, but seldom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
accompanied by other vanities, as
b<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ave apparrell, rich presents, sumptuous
banquets, and the like. By carelesnesse
tis true many Est<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tes are sunk which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
happens by the neglect or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honesty
of servants and Officers, but this
comes but by little and little; and if in
time perceived, is easily redressed.</p>
            <p>For great expence it is commonly the
errour of youth, comming suddenly to
great Estates (as hungry stomackes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to plenty of meat) to surfeit and over
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58534:11"/>
shoot themselves ere they are aware,
and though some Estates have fallen by
it, yet time and experience many times
make up the breach.</p>
            <p>Last of all comes Play, which being
layed in the scale, will outweigh all
the rest. All this above named are like
consumptions and lingering diseases,
that weaken and waste a mans body by
degrees, and if taken in season may be
prevented, but play like an Apoplexy, or
Pestilent infection strikes a man dead
at a blow, and is not unfitly compared
to Gun-Powder at one blast, blowing
up whole families and Estates: Other
wayes of spending have some corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence
with the wayes of getting,
for as money comes in by little and
little, so it goes out and may be as
long in spending, as it was in getting,
But by Play, the labours and fruits of
many yeers, may in one night be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
and come to nothing; for play
brings to a man, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, sudden
destruction; Lastly as other wayes of
expence cannot without a kind of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
and agreement amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58534:12"/>
ruine a man, this of Play, (be
he otherwise never so temperate, never
so chaste, so wise, so thrifty) of it self
is able irrecoverably to undoe him.</p>
            <p>Thus I have gone over the three most
notorious and generall effects and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents
of play, losse of time, losse of
credit, losse of money.</p>
            <p>There remaines some other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences,
which come not under any
of these three generall heads, yet are
they not so great and intrinsick, but that
they fall under popular observation.</p>
            <p>The first of these, is the great disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
which arises from the very end
of Play.</p>
            <p>The end of Play is either to win or
lose, but if there be more unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in losing then happinesse in
winning, this makes the disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage:
but that it is so is most appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent:
consider if a man have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Estate wherewith to live plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and contentedly, suppose hee
double this Estate by Play, it adds but
little, nay it rather diminishes his
former Estate; but if he lose halfe of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58534:12"/>
what he had before, what dayly occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of discontent arise, when he sees
himself abridged of his wonted plenty.</p>
            <p>But to make this more apparent, by
an example; suppose a man have a
1000. <hi>li.</hi> whether if he make this one
an 100000. <hi>li.</hi> is his happinesse greater,
then his misery would be, if he lost
all and should make it nothing? no
questionlesse, nay the misery is as much
greater, then the happinesse would be,
as the 100000. <hi>li.</hi> is greater, then the
1000. <hi>li.</hi> for happinesse and misery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only comparative, all men that
have more, nay many men that have
not so much, may be more happy then
he, but no man can be more miserable,
therefore is the misery greater then the
happinesse. This rule holds good also
in Philosophy: For it is a maxime that
there is a neerer proportion between
something and something, then between
somthing and nothing; so that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
is neerer between a 1000. <hi>li.</hi> &amp; a
penny, then between a penny &amp; nothing;
therefore to be brought from a small
estate to none is more bad, then to come
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58534:13"/>
from a small one to a very great one is
good, then is the disadvantage, in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
end of Play, more then 100. to one.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Another inconvenience
is, that the continuall use of Play,
robs a man of all pitty, charity, and
naturall affection, being hardened by
dayly seeing one another undone, and
ruined, as souldiers being continually
used to blood, grow thereby merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse.</p>
            <p>No man comes amisse to a Gamster,
whether, Brother, kinsman, or friend,
of whom he may make any advantage,
being so remote from all pity, that
when they see one falling, they will
rather precipitate, and throw him
head-long, then offer to help, or hold
him up.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Another inconvenience, is
that he that wins is bound to give the
loser leave to speak; to endure many
bold and intemperate Actions, to
beare with many indiscreet words,
and uncivill behaviour; which he is
tyed to suffer, only as a Winner, not as
a man of honour, who in things of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58534:13"/>
nature would resent the least
wrong that is done to him; besides
many suspitions and traducements of
his Play be it never so fair.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Another inconvenience
is, that when a man hath lost he is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to be insulted over, laughed at, and
scorned by them who have won,
which is worse to be endured, then the
losse of the money it selfe, verifying
that of the Poet, <hi>Nil habet infaelix pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertas
durius in se quam quod ridiculos
homines facit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And with this will I close the first
part of my discourse, wherein I have
onely spoken of Gaming as it trenches
upon morality, and civility; Now
will I speak in a word, how hainously it
is offensive to God.</p>
            <p>The profession of Gaming is little
lesse then professed Atheisme, for it is
not onely a manifest distrust, but an
open contempt of Gods threats, his
promises, and his providences: If
God speak nothing vainely, then much
lesse falsly; and if all his promises are
yea and Amen, is it not a strange pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58534:14"/>
to slight and despise them;
hath not God pronounced that goods
ill gotten shall not prosper? yet the
Gamester laughes in Gods face, and
sayes secretly to himselfe, I will try
whether they will prosper or not, say
God what he will: hath not God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
a woe to them who eat, drink,
sleep and rise up to play? yet is this the
whole life of a Gamester? hath he not
promised to all that relie upon him,
that they shall want nothing that is
good? yet the Gamester makes flesh
his arm, and relies upon his own Art
and Fortune, neither imploring the
Divine blessing, nor acknowledging any
thing they obtain from thence, but
that comes to passe with them, which
the Prophet speaketh; <hi>Laetantur exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
immolant plagis suis, &amp; sacrificant
reti suo.</hi> Certainly there is no one
vice that so desperately affronts God
in the breach of almost all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.
As for the first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
Is not God pulled out of his
Throne, and the Idol of fortune dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied,
and set up in his stead?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:58534:14"/>
But for the third, oh how is that
most precious name rent, and torn in
<unclear>curses</unclear>, blasphemies, execrations, yea
even to perjury it selfe? for the fourth,
I never knew any Gamester a Sabbata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian;
and although publike Authority
forbids the publike exercise of Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
yet is it as frequently used in
private on that day as any other; for
the fifth, I know none that have any ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Religious or honest Parents, but
they disswade and command them from
Play; then consequently it is a diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to them: for the sixth, It is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the occasion of mentall murther,
yea sometimes of actuall, and once
(that I remember) of selfe murther.</p>
            <p>To passe to the eighth, Gaming is a
kind of professed theft and little differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from that on the high way; onely
one is by force, the other by fraud.</p>
            <p>But for the tenth, it is so directly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to that, that the most inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
play can scarce avoide the breach
of it, for though a man play with his
Childe or servant to whom he must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
more then he wins, yet is there a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58534:15"/>
strange instinct of coveting and desire
of winning.</p>
            <p>Thus have I briefly shewed how play
doth either directly or indirectly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
eight of Gods ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
and if any other sin can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
of so great a latitude to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
up whereof there is such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
and concurrence of so many
other sins, I will be willing hereafter
to think play no sin: I will onely here
add a quaere or two and so conclude.</p>
            <p>First, Why should play be more
used in the night time then in the day,
considering the night is a time of rest
both to the body and minde.</p>
            <p>Play certainly is a work of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and herein Gamesters are like
beasts of prey, which rest all day and
goe abroad in the evening; as the
psalmist saith.</p>
            <p>Thou madest darknesse, that it might
be night, wherein all the beasts of the
forrest doe move. The Lyons roaring
after their prey &amp;c: the sun ariseth
and they get them away together, and
lay them down in their dens.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:58534:15"/>
Man goeth forth to his work and his
labour untill the evening.</p>
            <p>Thus fares it with Gamesters who
turn day into night, and night into day:
inverting the course of nature: herein
rather imitating Lyons and beasts of
the forrest then men who follow their
honest labours.</p>
            <p>My second quaere is, why in this as
in most other dangers one man should
not beware by anothers example, nay
not by their own, the fish will scarce
come twice to the hooke, nor the bird
to the net; having once escaped.</p>
            <p>But men having been often taken in
this snare have not the wit of fishes,
or birds to avoid it: certainly this is
a great master piece of the Devil, first
to worke upon the weaknesse of mens
inclinations, being of themselves too
prone to evil, having thus far prevailed
to win a man to play, he then musters
up all his Arts and <unclear>Tentations</unclear> fearing
to lose so fast an hold, and so great an
advantage, as when he hath made one a
Gamester.</p>
            <p>So that a man having entered into
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58534:16"/>
this course cannot without Divine as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
retire; the way being like (if
not the same way) that leades to hell,
as <hi>Virgil</hi> well describes it.</p>
            <p>Facilis descensus Averni,</p>
            <p>Sed revocare gradus, superasque evadere
ad auras.</p>
            <p>Hic labor hoc opus est.</p>
            <p>Thus have I performed this short
exercise of my pen, having onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciphered
this inchanting <hi>Circe,</hi> but in
a small table, and in a draught, leaving
it to some more curious hand, to draw
her in a larger proportion, and in more
lively colours, that so being the more
discovered, she may be the more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred.</p>
