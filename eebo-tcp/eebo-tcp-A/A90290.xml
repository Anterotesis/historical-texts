            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of this Prophecy, expreſſeth himſelfe to be
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115368:3"/>
in, wherein he hath companions in the dayes
wherein we live: <hi>He was griev'd in his ſpirit in
the middest of his body.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. The cauſe and means whereby he was

Viſions of his head troubled him.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. The Remedy he uſed for his delivery
from that intangled condition of ſpirit wherein
he was: <hi>He went nigh to one of them that stood
by, and asked him the truth of all this.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. <hi>The Iſſue of that application, he made</hi> to
that one that stood by <hi>for redreſſe:</hi> He told him,
and made him know the interpretation of the
things.</item>
            </list>
            <p>All theſe I ſhall breifly open unto you, that I
may lay a foundation for the truth which the
Lord hath furniſhed me with, to hold out unto
you this day.</p>
            <p>In the firſt, the perſon ſpoken of is <hi>Daniel</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
I <hi>Daniel;</hi> he beares this Teſtimony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
himſelfe, and his condition was, <hi>that he
was greived in his ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The perſon himſelfe was a man highly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
of God, above all in his Generation: ſo
richly furniſhed with Gifts and Graces, that he
is once and againe brought forth as an Example,
and inſtanced in by God himſelfe, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of eminence in <hi>Wiſdome and Piety.</hi> Yet all
this preſerves him not, from falling into this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
condition. <hi>Dan. 1. 17. 20. Ez. 9. 24. Ch.</hi>
28. 3.</p>
            <p>Now as the principall worke of all the holy
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115368:3"/>
Prophets, <hi>which have been ſince the world began.
(Luk. 1. 70. 1. Pet.</hi> 1. 10, 11, 12.) was to Preach,
ſet forth and declare the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the
Meſſias, who was for to come, ſo ſome eſpeciall
concernments of his Perſon, Righteouſneſſe and
Kingdome, were in eſpeciall manner committed
unto them reſpectively. His Paſſion and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
to <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> the Covenant of Grace in
him to <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> &amp; to this <hi>Daniel</hi> moſt eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the great works of the Providence of God, in
the ſhaking and overturning of Kingdomes and
Nations, in a ſubſerviency to his Kingdome;
with the Revelation hereof for the conſolation
of the Church in all ages, did the Lord honour
him of whom we ſpeak.</p>
            <p>For the preſent he deſcribes himſelfe in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
a perplexed condition. His ſpirit, (minde
and <hi>ſoule) was greived, ſick, troubled, or diſquieted
in the middest of his body;</hi> that is, deeply, neerely,
cloſely: it ſets out the greatneſſe of his Trouble,
the anxiety of his Thoughts within him: like <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
when he expoſtulated with his ſoule about
it. <hi>Pſ. 43. 5. why art thou ſo ſad my ſoule, and why
art thou ſo diſquieted within me:</hi> he knew not
what to ſay, what to doe, nor wherewith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive
himſelfe. He was filled with ſad thoughts,
ſad Apprehenſions of what was to come to paſſe,
and what might be the Iſſue of the things that
had been diſcovered unto him. This I ſay is the
frame and temper he deſcribes himſelfe to be in:
a man under ſad Apprehenſions of the Iſſues
and events of things, and the diſpenſations of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115368:4"/>
God, as many are at this day: and upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
cloſly, and neerly perplexed.</p>
            <p>2. The cauſe of this perturbation of minde,
and ſpirit was from the <hi>viſions of his head: The
viſions of his head troubled him.</hi> He cals them
<hi>viſions of the head,</hi> becauſe that is the ſeat
of the internall ſenſes, and phantaſie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
viſions are received. So he cals them <hi>a dream,</hi>
v. 1. <hi>and viſions of his head upon his Bed: yet
ſuch viſions, ſuch a dreame</hi> it was, as being imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
from God, and containing a no leſſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
diſcovery of his Will, and minde, then if
the things mentioned in them, had been ſpoken
<hi>face to face, he writes them by the inſpiration of
the Holy Ghost, v.</hi> 2. for the uſe of the Church.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not take the advantage of going forth
unto any diſcourſe, of <hi>dreames, viſions, Oracles, and
thoſe other diverſe wayes and manners (Heb.</hi> 1. 1.)
of revealing his minde and will, which God was
pleaſed to uſe with his Prophets of old: <hi>(Numb.</hi>
12. 6, 7, 8.) My aime lies another way: it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
only to take notice, that God gave him in
his <hi>ſleep</hi> a repreſentation of the things here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
which he was to give over, for the uſe of
the Church in following Ages. The matter of
<hi>theſe viſions</hi> which did ſo much trouble him,
falls more directly under our conſideration.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>ſubject</hi> of theſe perplexing <hi>viſions,</hi> is
a repreſentation of the foure <hi>great Empires of the
World,</hi> which had, and were to have Dominion,
in and over the places of the Churches greateſt
concernments, and were all to receive their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115368:4"/>
and deſtruction by the Lord Chriſt, and his
revenging hand: And theſe three things he
mentions of them therein.</p>
            <p>1. Riſe. 2. Nature. 3. Destruction.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>V.</hi> 2. he deſcribes their <hi>Riſe and Originall:</hi>
it was <hi>from the strivings of the foure Winds of the
Heavens, upon the great Sea;</hi> he compares them to
the moſt violent, uncontroleable, and tumultua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
things in the whole Creation: <hi>Winds and
Seas!</hi> what waves, what horrible ſtormes, what
mixing of heaven and earth, what confuſion, and
deſtruction muſt needs enſue the fierce conteſt
of all contrary Winds upon the <hi>great ſea?</hi> Such
are the Springs of Empires, and Governments
for the moſt part amongſt men, ſuch their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trances
and Advancements. In particular, ſuch
were the beginnings of the foure Empires here
ſpoken of. <hi>Warrs, Tumults, Confuſions, Bloud, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
Deſolation,</hi> were the ſeeds of their
greatneſſe <hi>(vastitiem ubi-fecerunt, pacem vocant
Galgac. apud Tacit.)</hi> Seas and great <hi>Waters</hi> doe
in the Scripture repreſent people, and nations.
<hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 15. The <hi>waters which thou ſawest, where
the Whoore ſitteth, are people, and multitudes, and
nations, and tongues;</hi> as Waters, they are unſtable,
fierce, reſtleſſe, tumultuating, and when God
mingleth his judgments amongſt them, they are
as <hi>a ſea of glaſſe mingled with fire;</hi> britle, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
devouring and implacable.</p>
            <p>It is a demonſtration of the ſoveraignty of God,
that he is above them: <hi>Pſal. 93. 3, 4. The floods
have lifted up ô Lord, the floods have lifted up their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115368:5"/>
voyce, the floods lift up their waves. The Lord on
high is mightier then the noyſe of many waters, yea
then the mighty waves of the Sea.</hi> Now from
theſe, toſſed with the windes of Commotions,
Seditions, Oppreſſions, Paſſions, doe flow the
Governments of the World, the ſpirit of God
moving upon the face of thoſe Waters, to bring
forth thoſe formes and frames of Rule, which
he will make uſe of.</p>
            <p>2. Unto v. 9. he deſcribes them <hi>in order, as
to their nature and kind:</hi> one of them being then
ready to be deſtroyed, and the other to ſucceed,
untill the utter deſolation of them all, and all
power riſing in their ſpirit and principle.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not paſſe through their particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,
nor ſtay to prove that the fourth Beaſt,
without name or ſpeciall forme, is the <hi>Roman
Empire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sermon on <hi>Heb:</hi> 12. 27, 28.</note> which I have elſewhere demonſtrated;
and it is ſomething elſe which at this time I aime
at. This is that which <hi>troubles and grieves the
ſpirit of Daniel in the midst of his body.</hi> He ſaw
what worldly powers ſhould ariſe, by what hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
tumults, ſhakings, confuſions, and violence
they ſhould ſpring up, with what fierceneſſe, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
and perſecution, they ſhould rule in the
World, and ſtamp all under their feet.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Their end and destruction</hi> is revealed unto
him, from <hi>v.</hi> 10. unto 12, 13. And this by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of <hi>the Antient of daies,</hi> the eternall
God in judgement againſt them: which he ſets
out with that ſolemnity and glory, as if it were
the great judgement of the laſt day: God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115368:5"/>
thereby giving a pledge unto the World, of
that <hi>univerſall judgement</hi> he will one day exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
<hi>towards all, by the man whom he hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi>
(Act. 17. 31.) And this encreaſeth the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of the viſion, to have ſuch a repreſentation of
the glory of God, as no creature is able to beare:
God alſo manifeſts hereby his immediate actings,
in the ſetting up, and pulling down the powers
of this World, which he doth as fully and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually,
as if he ſate upon a Throne of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
calling them all by name to appeare in his
preſence, and upon the evidence of their waies,
cruelties and oppreſſion, pronouncing ſentence
againſt them:<note place="margin">Pſal. 2. 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>Be wiſe therefore O yee Kings, be
instructed yee Iudges of the earth: ſerve the Lord
with feare and rejoyce with trembling; He chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the times and ſeaſons: Dan. 2. 21. He ruleth in
the Kingdome of men, and ſetteth over it whom he
pleaſeth.</hi> cap. 5. 21. And this is the firſt thing in
this viſion, at which the Prophet was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed.</p>
            <p>2. There is the approach of the Lord Chriſt
unto the Father, with his entrance into his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and Dominion which is everlasting, and
paſſeth not away.</hi> v. 14. This being the end of the
viſion, I muſt a little inſiſt upon it; not that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
purpoſely to handle the Kingdome of
Chriſt as Mediator, but only a little to conſider
it, as it lies here in the viſion, and is needfull for
the right bottoming of the Truth in our intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Various have been the thoughts of men about
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115368:6"/>
the Kingdome of Chriſt in all Ages. That the
Meſſiah was to be a <hi>King,</hi> a <hi>Prince,</hi> a <hi>Ruler, that
he was to have a Kingdome,</hi> and that the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was to be on his ſhoulders,</hi> is evident from
the Old Teſtament. That all this was, and is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed
in <hi>Ieſus of Nazareth,</hi> whom God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted,
made a Prince and a Saviour, is no
leſſe evident in the New.</p>
            <p>But about the nature of this Kingdome, its
Riſe, and manner of Government, have been
and are the conteſts of men.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iewes</hi> to this very day expect it, as a
thing carnall, and temporall, viſible, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
glorious, wherein, in all manner of
pleaſure, they ſhall beare rule over the nations,
at their will; ſuch another thing of all the
world, as the <hi>Popedome,</hi> which the <hi>Gentile</hi> or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous
worſhippers of Chriſt ſet up for his
Kingdome: And of ſome ſuch thing it may be
ſuppoſed, the Apoſtles themſelves were not
without thoughts, untill they had converſed
with the Lord after the reſurrection. <hi>(Luk. 9. 46.
Act.</hi> 2. 6.) Neither are all amongſt us free from
them at this day.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who with any ſimplicity profeſſe the
name of Chriſt, doe generally agree, that there
are three parts of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt and <hi>Principally;</hi> in that which is <hi>internall
and ſpirituall,</hi> in and over the ſoules of men, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſpirits both good and bad, in reference unto
the ends which he hath to accompliſh upon
them: of that which is direct and immediate
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115368:6"/>
upon the hearts and ſoules of men, there are two
parts.</p>
            <p>1. That which he exerciſeth towards his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
who are given unto him of his Father, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting,
ruling, preſerving them,</hi> under and
through great variety of diſpenſations internall
and externall, untill he brings them unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
<hi>he stands and feeds them in the strength of
the Lord, in the Majesty of the name of the Lord
his God. Mich. 5. 4. Even he who is the ruler of
Iſrael.</hi> v. 2. <hi>He is exalted and made a Prince, and a
Saviour to give repentance to Iſrael, for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe
of ſinnes,</hi> Act. 5. 31. <hi>He makes his people
a willing people in the day of his power,</hi> Pſal. 110.
3. Sending out his holy ſpirit to lead them into
all truth, and making his word, and Ordinances
<hi>mighty through God, to the pulling down of strong
holds in their hearts, casting down imaginations,
and every high thing that exalts it ſelfe against
the knowledge of God; and bringing into captivity
every thought to the obedience of himſelfe.</hi> 2 Cor.
10. 4, 5. He takes poſſeſſion of their hearts by his
power, dwelling in them by his ſpirit, making
them Kings in his Kingdome, and bringing them
infallibly into glory: Oh that this Rule, this
Kingdome of his, might be carried on in our
hearts! we buſy our ſelves about many things,
we ſhall find at length, this one thing neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
this is that part of the Kingdome of
Chriſt, which we are principally to aime at in the
Preaching of the Goſpell: <hi>We Preach Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 5. Him to be Lord and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115368:7"/>
King, though others have had Dominion over us:
They are the graines of Iſrael which the Lord
ſeeks for in his ſifting the Nations by his word, as
well as by his providence, and we are in the
work of the Goſpell to <hi>endure all things for the
Elects ſake: 2 Cor.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
            <p>2. In the power which he exerciſeth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
others, to whom the word of the Goſpell
doth come, <hi>calling, convincing, enlightning,
hardning many,</hi> who yet being <hi>not his ſheepe,</hi> nor
of his fold, he will never take to him ſelfe: but
leaves to themſelves, under aggravations of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
which they pull upon themſelves by
the contempt of the Goſpell, 2 <hi>Cor. 2. 16. Heb.</hi> 10.
29. He ſends his <hi>ſpirit to convince</hi> even the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
<hi>world of ſinne, righteouſneſſe, and judgement,
Ioh.</hi> 16. 8. He ſendeth <hi>ſharp Arrowes into the very
hearts of his enemies, Pſal.</hi> 45. 5. making them
ſtoop, bow, and fall under him: ſo bounding
their rage, overbearing their luſts, leaving them
without excuſe in themſelves, and his people, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
not without profit from them: with
ſome dealing even in this life more ſeverely,
cauſing the <hi>witneſſes</hi> of the Goſpell, to torment
them by the Preaching of the word, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.
10. Yet giving them up to ſtrong deluſions, rhat
they may believe lyes, and be damned. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.
11, 12. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>3. In carrying on of this work towards the
one and the other, he puts forth the Power, Rule,
and Dominion, which he hath of his Father <hi>over
Spirits,</hi> both good and bad: being made <hi>head of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115368:7"/>
Principalities, and Powers,</hi> and exalted farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<hi>every name in Heaven or Earth,</hi> being
made the <hi>first borne of every creature,</hi> and all the
<hi>Angells of God, being commanded to worſhip him,</hi>
Heb. 1. 6. and put in <hi>ſubjection under his feet;</hi> he
ſends them forth, and uſes them as <hi>ministring
ſpirits for them who ſhall be heires of ſalvation,</hi>
v. 14. appoynting them to <hi>behold the face of his
Father,</hi> ready for his command on their
behalfe, <hi>Math.</hi> 18. 10. Attending in <hi>their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
1 Cor.</hi> 11. 10. And to give them their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
in the time of <hi>danger and trouble, Act. 12.
9. Destroying their adverſaries,</hi> v. 23. With innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
other advantagious Adminiſtrations,
which he hath not thought good to acquaint us
withall in particular, that our dependance might
be on our King himſelfe, and not on any of our
<hi>fellow ſervants,</hi> though never ſo glorious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.
<hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 9.</p>
            <p>2. For Satan as he came to <hi>bind the strong
man armed, and to ſpoyle his goods, Mat. 12. 29.
To destroy him that had the power of death, Heb.</hi>
2. 14. And being made <hi>manifest to this end, that
he might destroy his works, 1 Ioh.</hi> 3. 8. In the
ſoules of men in this World, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5. So ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in his own perſon conquered theſe <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities
and Powers of darkneſſe, making an open
ſhew of them in his croſſe, and triumphing over
them, Col.</hi> 2. 15. He continues overruleing and
judging him and them, in their oppoſition to his
Church, and will doe ſo untill he bring them to
a full conqueſt and ſubjection, that they ſhall be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115368:8"/>
               <hi>judged and ſentenced</hi> by the poore creatures,
whom in this world they continually purſue
with all manner of enmity: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 3.</p>
            <p>And this looketh to the inward ſubſtance of
the Kingdome of Chriſt, which is given him of
his Father, and is <hi>not of this world,</hi> though he
exerciſe it in the World to the laſt day: a
Kingdome, which can never be ſhaken, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved:
the <hi>Government of it is upon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and of the increaſe of it, there ſhall be no
end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That <hi>Rule or Government,</hi> which in his
word he hath appoynted and ordained, for all
his Saints and choſen ones to walk in, to teſtify
their inward ſubjection to him, and to be fitted
for uſefulneſſe one to another. Now of this part
the Adminiſtration is wrapt up in the <hi>Lawes,
Ordinances, Institutions, and appoyntments of the
Goſpell,</hi> and it is frequently called the <hi>Kingdome
of God.</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt doth not <hi>rule</hi> in theſe
things, and is not to be obeyed as a King in
them, is but a late darkneſſe, which though it
ſhould ſpread as a cloud over the face of the
heavens, and powre forth ſome ſhowres and
tempeſts, yet it would be as a cloud ſtill, which
will ſpeedily ſcatter and vaniſh into nothing.</p>
            <p>And this is that, whoſe propagation, as the
means of carrying on the former ſpirituall ends
of Chriſt, which you deſire ſtrength and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
for, this day, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Men may gather together unto Chriſt and
ſay, with <hi>heads</hi> full of hopes poore ſoule, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115368:8"/>
eyes fixed on right <hi>hand and left, Lord wilt thou
at this time restore the Kingdome to Iſrael?</hi> Take
you his anſwer and be contented with it; <hi>It is not
for you to know the times and ſeaſons,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 1. 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>which the
Father hath put in his own power, but doe you ask
work faithfully.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know in this thing, it is farre eaſier to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
of you for not doing, then to direct you
what to doe; the Lord be your guide, <hi>and give
you straw where ever Bricks are required of you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. In the <hi>univerſall judgement,</hi> which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath committed to him over all: which he
will moſt eminently exerciſe at the laſt day; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding,
crowning, receiving ſome to himſelfe,
judging, condemning, caſting others into utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darkneſſe:
<hi>(Ioh. 5. 22, 27. Act. 2. 36. Rom.</hi> 14. 9.
<hi>Act.</hi> 17. 31.)</p>
            <p>And of this univerſall righteous judgement,
he giveth many warnings unto the world, by
powring forth ſundry vialls of his wrath, upon
great <hi>Nimrods</hi> and oppreſſors. <hi>(Pſal. 110. 6. Mich.</hi>
4. 3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 11, 12, 13. And in the holding forth
theſe three parts of the Kingdome of the Lord
Jeſus, doth the Scripture abound.</p>
            <p>But now whether over and beyond all theſe,
the Lord Chriſt ſhall not beare an <hi>outward, viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
glorious rule?</hi> Setting up a Kingdome like
thoſe of the World, to be ruled by ſtrength and
power? and if ſo; When, or how it ſhall be
brought in, into whoſe hands the Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it ſhall be comitted, &amp; upon what account,
whether he will <hi>perſonally</hi> walk therein or no,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115368:9"/>
whether it ſhall be clearely diſtinct from the
<hi>Rule</hi> he now bears in the world, or only differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by more glorious <hi>degrees and manifestations
of his power?</hi> Endleſſe and irreconcileable, are
the conteſts of thoſe that profeſſe his name: This
we find by <hi>wofull experience,</hi> that all who from
the ſpirituality of the <hi>Rule</hi> of Chriſt, and delight
therein, have degenerated into carnall appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
of the beauty and glory of it, have for
the moſt part, been given up to carnall actings,
ſuited to ſuch apprehenſions, and have been ſo
dazeled, with gazing after temporall glory, that
the Kingdome which comes not by obſervation,
hath been vile in their eyes.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe it is here fallen in my way, and
is part of the <hi>viſion,</hi> at which the <hi>Prophet was ſo
much troubled,</hi> I ſhall give you ſome briefe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
of what is cleare and certain from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
relating hereunto, and ſo paſſe on: It is then
certain;</p>
            <p>1. That the <hi>Interest of particular men</hi> as to
this <hi>Kingdome of Christ,</hi> is to look where the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
concernment of all Saints, in all ages doth
lye: This undoubtedly they may attaine, and it
doth belong to them: now certainly this is in
that part of it, which <hi>comes not by obſervation,
Luk. 17. 20. But is within us,</hi> which <hi>is Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
Peace, and joy in the Holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ghost, Rom.</hi> 14.
17. <hi>This</hi> may be poſſeſſed in a dungeon, as well
as on a Throne. What <hi>outward glory ſoever may
be brought in,</hi> it is but a ſhadow of this: this is
the <hi>Kingdome that cannot be moved, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115368:9"/>
grace in us to ſerve God acceptably, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
and Godly feare,</hi> Heb. 12. 28. Many have
failed in gaſping after outward appearances: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any failed of bleſſedneſſe, who made this
their portion: Oh that this were more purſued
and followed after! Let not any think to ſet up
the Kingdome of Chriſt in the <hi>World,</hi> while they
pull it down in their own hearts, by ſinne and
folly: in this let the <hi>lines fall</hi> to me, and let my
Inheritance be among thoſe that are ſanctified:
yet,</p>
            <p>2. This is certain, that all Nations whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
which in their preſent ſtate and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
have given their power to <hi>the Dragon</hi> and
the Beaſt to oppoſe the Lord Chriſt withall, ſhall
be ſhaken, broken, tranſlated, and turned off
their old foundations, and conſtitutions, into
which the Antichriſtian intereſt hath been wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for a long ſeaſon. God will ſhake the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
and the Earth</hi> of the Nations round about,
untill all the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> rubbiſh, all their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
ingagements to the man of ſinne be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p>This I have fully demonſtrated elſewhere.
All thoſe great Warres which you have fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told,<note place="margin">Serm. on <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 28</note>
wherein the <hi>Saints</hi> of God ſhall be emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
ingaged, are upon this account.</p>
            <p>3. That the civill powers of the World af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
fearfull ſhakings and deſolations ſhall be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed
of, into an uſefull <hi>ſubſerviency to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
Power, and Kingdome of Ieſus Christ:</hi> hence
they are ſaid to be his Kingdoms. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:115368:10"/>
That is, to be diſpoſed of, for the behoofe of his
intereſt, rule, and Dominion: of this you have
plentifull promiſes <hi>Iſai</hi> 60. and elſewhere; when
the nations are broken in oppoſition to Syon,
<hi>their gain must be conſecrated to the Lord, and
their ſubstance to the Lord of the whole earth,
Mich.</hi> 4. 15. Even <hi>Iudges and Rulers,</hi> (as ſuch)
muſt <hi>Kiſſe the Sonne,</hi> and own his Scepter, and
advance his waies: ſome think, if you were well
ſetled, you ought not in any thing, <hi>as Rulers of
the Nations,</hi> to put forth your power, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of Chriſt: the good Lord keep your hearts
from that apprehenſion. Have you ever in your
Affaires, received any encouragement from the
promiſes of God, have you in times of greateſt
diſtreſſe been refreſhed with the teſtimony of
a good conſcience, that in Godly ſimplicity, you
have ſought the advancement of the Lord
Chriſt; doe you believe that he ever owned the
cauſe as the head of his Church? Doe not now
profeſſe you have nothing to doe with him: had
he ſo profeſſed of you and your affaires, what
had been your portion long ſince!</p>
            <p>4. Look what <hi>Kingdome</hi> ſoever, the Lord
Chriſt will advance in the World, and exerciſe
amongſt his <hi>holy Ones,</hi> the beginning of it muſt
be with the <hi>Iewes;</hi> they are to be <hi>caput Imperii,</hi>
the head and ſeat of this Empire muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them; theſe are the <hi>Saints of the most
High, mentioned by Daniell:</hi> and therefore in that
part of his Propheſy, which he wrote in the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dean
Tongue,</hi> then commonly known and ſpoken
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115368:10"/>
in the Eaſt, being the language of the <hi>Babyloniſh
Empire,</hi> he ſpeaketh of them obſcurely, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
borrowed expreſſions; but coming to thoſe
viſions which he wrote in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> for the ſole uſe
of the Church, he is much more expreſſe,
concerning the people of whom he ſpake. The
Rod of <hi>Christs strength goes out of Syon,</hi> and
thence he proceeds to rule thoſe that were his
enemies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 2. All the promiſes of the
glorious Kingdome of Chriſt, are to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
in the gathering of the Gentiles, with the
glory of the Jewes. <hi>The Redeemer comes to Syon,
and to them that turne from tranſgreſſion (that
great tranſgreſsion of unbeliefe) in Iacob: Iſai. 59.
20. Then ſhall the Lord riſe upon them, and his
glory ſhall be ſeen upon them, the Gentiles ſhall
come to their light, and Kings to the brightneſſe of
their riſing: Iſai:</hi> 60. 2, 3. I dare ſay there is not
any promiſe any where of raiſing up <hi>a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
unto the Lord Christ</hi> in this World, but it is
either expreſſed or clearely intimated, that the
beginning of it muſt be with the <hi>Iews,</hi> and that
in contradiſtinction to the Nations: ſo eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in that glorious deſcription of it, <hi>Mich. 4. 7, 8.
I will make her that halted a remnant, and her
that was cast a farre off a strong Nation, and the
Lord ſhall reigne over them in Mount Syon, from
hence forth even for ever: and thou O Tower of the
flock, the strong hold of the Daughter of Syon, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee ſhall it come even the first Dominion, the
Kingdome ſhall come to the Daughter of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>
When the great <hi>hunter Nimrod</hi> ſet up a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115368:11"/>
Kingdome, the <hi>beginning of it was Babell. Gen.</hi> 10.
10. &amp; when the great <hi>Shepheard</hi> ſets up his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
the beginning of it ſhall be Syon: ſo far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it is at large expreſſed, <hi>Mich.</hi> 5. 7, 8. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more cleare to any, who, being not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
away with weake, carnall apprehenſions of
things preſent, have once ſeriouſly weighed the
promiſes of God to this purpoſe: what the Lord
Chriſt will doe with them, and by them, is not
ſo cleare, this is certain, that their returne ſhall
be marvelous, glorious, as life from the dead.
When then <hi>Euphrates ſhall be dryed up, Turkiſh
power,</hi> and <hi>Popiſh Idolatry</hi> be taken out of the
world, and theſe <hi>Kings of the East</hi> are come,
when the <hi>ſeed of Abraham,</hi> being <hi>multiplied like
the starres of Heaven, and the ſands of the Sea
ſhore,</hi> ſhall poſſeſſe the gates of their enemies, and
ſhall have peace in their borders, we may lift up
our heads towards the fulneſſe of our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
but whileſt theſe things are or may be, (for
any thing we know,) a farre off, to dream of
ſetting up an outward, glorious, viſible king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Chriſt, which he muſt beare rule in, and
over the world, be it in <hi>Germany,</hi> or in <hi>England,</hi>
is but an ungrounded preſumption. The Jewes
not called, Antichriſt not deſtroyed, the Nations
of the World generally wrapt up in Idolatry and
falſe-worſhip, little dreaming of their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:
wil the Lord Chriſt leave the world in this
ſtate, &amp; ſet up his Kingdome here on a mole-hil?</p>
            <p>5. This is a perpetuall <hi>Antitheſis,</hi> and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
that is put between the <hi>Kingdoms of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115368:11"/>
World,</hi> and the Kingdome of Chriſt; that they
riſe out of the <hi>strivings of the winds upon the Sea,</hi>
he comes with the <hi>clouds of Heaven:</hi> They are
brought in by <hi>commotions, tumults, warres, deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi>
and ſo ſhall all the ſhakings of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
be, to puniſh them for their old oppoſition,
and to tranſlate them into a ſubſerviency to his
intereſt: The comming in of the kingdome of
Chriſt, ſhall not be by the Arme of fleſh, nor ſhall
it be the product of the ſtrifes and conteſts of
men which are in the world: it is not to be done
<hi>by might or power, but by the ſpirit of the Lord of
Hosts: 2. Zech.</hi> 4. 6. great Warres, deſolations, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations,
ſhall precede it: but it is not the ſonnes
of men that by outward force, ſhall <hi>build the new
Jeruſalem: that comes down from heaven adorned
as a Bride from Christ,</hi> fitted and prepared by
himſelfe: certainly the ſtrivings of men about
this buſineſſe ſhall have no influence into it. It
ſhall be by the glorious manifeſtation of his own
power, and that by his ſpirit ſubduing the ſoules
of men unto it; not by the ſword of man ſetting
up a few to rule over others. Hence it is every
where called a creating of a <hi>new heaven and a
new earth: Iſa:</hi> 65. 17. a work doubleſſe to
difficult for the wormes of the earth to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take.
There is nothing more oppoſite to the
ſpirit of the Goſpell, then to ſuppoſe that Jeſus
Chriſt will take to himſelfe a kingdome by the
carnall ſword and bow of the ſonnes of men.
The raiſing of the <hi>Tabernacle of David which is
fallen down, and the ſetting up the decayed places
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115368:12"/>
of it, Act:</hi> 15. 16. is done by his viſiting the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with his ſpirit and word, <hi>v.</hi> 14. It is by the
powring out of his Spirit in a covenant of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:
<hi>Iſai:</hi> 59. 21.</p>
            <p>Thus the Lord ſets up one <hi>Shepheard of his
people, and he ſhall feed them, even</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>my
ſervant David, he ſhall feed them, and he ſhall be
their ſhepheard, and the Lord will be their God, and
my ſervant David a Prince among them: Ezek:</hi>
34. 24, 25. he brings in the kingdome of his ſon,
by making the children of <hi>Iſrael ſeek the Lord
their God, and David their King, and to feare the
Lord and his goodneſſe. Hoſ:</hi> 3. 5. Who now can
fathome the counſails of the Almighty, who hath
ſearched his boſome, and can by computation
tell us, when he ſhall power out his ſpirit for the
accompliſhment of theſe things?</p>
            <p>This then is the <hi>last thing in this viſion,</hi> whoſe
conſideration brought the Prophet, into ſo great
perplexity and diſtreſſe of ſpirit.</p>
            <p>3. There is the means that <hi>Daniel</hi> uſed for
redreſſe, in that ſad condition where unto he was
brought by the conſideration of this viſion: <hi>He
drew neere to one of them that stood by, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him the truth of all this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This alſo was done in <hi>viſion:</hi> There is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his waking before his making this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe:
but the viſion continuing, he drawes nigh
in the ſame manner <hi>to one of them that stood by;</hi>
one of thoſe Angels or holy ones, that ſtood <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring
before the throne of God,</hi> who was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionated
to acquaint him with the mind and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115368:12"/>
will of God in the things repreſented to him.
This then is the remedy he applies himſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
He labours to know the mind and will of
God, in the things that were to be done: this it
ſeems he pitched on, as the only way for quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his <hi>greived and troubled ſpirit;</hi> and hereupon,</p>
            <p>4. He <hi>is told and made to know the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the things;</hi> ſo farre at leaſt as might <hi>quiet
his ſpirit</hi> in the will of God: not that he is clearly
inſtructed in every particular, for he tels them in
the cloſe of the chapter, that he had troubleſome
thoughts about the whole; <hi>his cogitations troubled
him, and his countenance changed, v.</hi> 28. but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
received what light God was willing to
communicate to him, he enquires no farther, but
addreſſes himſelfe to his own duty.</p>
            <p>Take then from the words thus opened theſe
propoſitions, ſome whereof I ſhall doe little more
then name unto you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerve 1. In the conſideration of Gods mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
actings in the world, in order to the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on of the Goſpell, and interest of the Lord Jeſus
Christ, the hearts of his Saints are oftentimes filled
with perplexity and trouhle.</hi> They know not what
will be the Iſſue, nor ſome times what well to
doe. <hi>Daniel</hi> receives a viſion of the things which
<hi>in part</hi> we live under: and if they fill his heart
with Aſtoniſhment, is it any wonder if they come
cloſe to us, and fill us with anxious perplexing
thoughts, upon whom the things themſelves
are fallen?</p>
            <p>2. Obſerve: <hi>the only way to deliver and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115368:13"/>
our ſpirits from under ſuch perplexities, and
entanglements, is to draw nigh to God in Christ, for
diſcovery of his will; ſo did Daniel here: he went to
one of them that ministred</hi> before the Lord to
be acquainted with his will, otherwiſe thoughts
&amp; contrivances will but farther perplex you; like
men in the mire, whileſt they pluck one legge
out, the other ſticketh faſter in: whileſt you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
your ſelves in one thing, you will be more
hampered in another.</p>
            <p>Yea he that <hi>increaſeth wiſdome, increaſeth ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi>
the larger the viſions are, the greater will
be their troubles; untill being conſumed in your
own feares, cares and contrivances, you grow
uſeleſſe in your Generation: thoſe who ſee only
the outſide of your affaires, ſleep ſecurely: thoſe
who come neigher to look into the ſpirits of
men, Reſt is taken from them: and many are not
quiet, becauſe they will not: the great healing of
all is in God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerve 3. When God makes known the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations
of things, it will quiet your ſpirits in
your walking before him, and actings with him.</hi>
This was that which brought the ſpirit of <hi>Daniel</hi>
into a ſettlement. How God reveales his mind
in theſe things, by what means, how it may be
known by individuall perſons, for their quiet
and ſettlement, how all Gods Revelations are
quieting, and tend to the calming of mens ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
not making them foame like the waves of
the Sea, ſhould be handled on this obſervation,
but I begin with the firſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:115368:13"/>
When <hi>John</hi> received his book of viſions in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the great things that were to be done,
&amp; the alterations that were to be brought about,
though it were <hi>ſweet in his mouth,</hi> and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced
in his imployment, yet it made <hi>his belly
bitter: Rev.</hi> 10. 9, 10. it filled him with perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as our Prophet ſpeaks, in the middeſt of his
body; he ſaw blood and confuſion, ſtrife and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence;
it made his very belly bitter.</p>
            <p>Poore <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> upon the ſame account, is ſo
oppreſſed, that it makes him break out of all
bounds of faith and patience, <hi>to curſe the day of
his birth,</hi> to waxe quite weary of his imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<hi>chap.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour deſcribing ſuch a ſeaſon <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.
26. tels us, <hi>that mens hearts ſhall faile them for
feare, and for looking after thoſe things that are
comming upon the earth:</hi> they will be thinking
what will become of them, and what will be
the Iſſue of Gods diſpenſations; fearing that the
whole frame of things will be wrapt up in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and confuſion. Hence our Saviour bids
his Diſciples not <hi>be troubled</hi> when they heare of
<hi>theſe things, Math.</hi> 24. 6. intimating that they
will be very apt, ſo to be.</p>
            <p>Now the Cauſes and occaſions (which are the
<hi>Reaſons</hi> of the point) ariſe, Firſt, from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and aſtoniſhableneſſe of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
which God will doe: <hi>even great and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
things which men looked not for. Iſai.</hi> 64. 2,
3. when he coms <hi>to make his name knowne to the
nations, that his Aduerſaries may tremble at his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115368:14"/>
preſence, &amp; doth terrible things</hi> quite above &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which they never once
looked for; no wonder if their hearts be ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
with amazement. It hath of late been ſo with
this <hi>Nation:</hi> all profeſſors at the beginning of theſe
dayes, joyned earneſtly in that prayer <hi>Iſai.</hi> 63.
17, 18, 19. <hi>Chap.</hi> 64. 1. God in anſwere hereunto,
<hi>comes down and rents the heaven, and the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
flow downe at his preſence,</hi> according to the
deſire of their ſoules: yet withall he doth <hi>terrible
things,</hi> things that we looked not for; How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poor
creatures are turned back with Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and know not how to abide with him?
When our Saviour Chriſt came in the fleſh, who
had been the deſire of all Nations, for 4000
years, &amp; moſt importunately ſought after by the
men of that generation, where in he came, yet do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
great and unexpected things at his comming,
who <hi>who was able to abide it?</hi> This, ſayes <hi>Simeon,</hi>
will be the Iſſue of it. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 34, 35. He ſhall be
for the fall and riſe of many; and the thoughts
of many hearts ſhall be revealed. Hence is that
exclamation. <hi>Mal. 3. 2. Who may abide the day of
his comming, and who ſhall ſtand when he appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth:</hi>
his comming is deſired indeed, but few
can beare it: <hi>his day will burne as an oven, as a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,
ch.</hi> 4. 1. ſome are <hi>over heated</hi> by it, ſome <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume</hi>
in it, bleſſed are they that abide: this is one
cauſe of the perplexing of the ſpirits of men: The
conſideration of the things themſelves that are
done, being above and beyond their expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and this even many of the Saints of God are
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115368:14"/>
born down under, at this day: They little looked
for the blood and baniſhment of Kings, change
of Government, Alteration of Nations, ſuch
ſhakings of Heaven and Earth, as have inſued;
not conſidering that he who doth theſe things,
weighs all the nations in a ballance, and the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
of them are as the duſt thereof before him.</p>
            <p>2. From the manner whereby God will doe
theſe things: many perplexing, killing circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
attend his diſpenſations: I ſhall inſtance
only in one: and that is darkneſſe and obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
whereby he holds the minds of men in uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
and ſuſpence, for his own glorious ends:
ſuch he tels us ſhall his day, &amp; the workes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
be. <hi>Zech. 14. 6, 7. And it ſhall come to paſſe in
that day, that the light ſhall not be cleare, nor
dark. But it ſhall be one day which ſhall be known
to the Lord, not day, nor night: but it ſhall come to
paſſe that at evening-time it ſhall be light.</hi> Men
ſhall not know what to make of it, nor what to
judge: he brings not forth his work all at once,
but by degrees, and ſometimes ſets it backward,
and leads it up and down, as he did his people of
old in the wilderneſſe, that none might know
where they ſhould fall or ſettle: and he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth
will not make haſt. When God is doing
great things, he delights to wrap them up in the
clouds, to keep the minds of men in uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that he may ſet on work all that is in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and try them to the utmoſt, whether they can
live upon his care and wiſdome, when they ſee
their own care and wiſdome will doe no good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:115368:15"/>
Men would faine come to ſome <hi>certainty,</hi> and
commonly by <hi>the thoughts and wayes</hi> whereby
they preſſe unto it, they put all things into more
uncertainty then ever, and ſo promote the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
of God, which they ſo ſtudiouſly endeavour
to decline: Hence is that deſcription of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the Lord in his mighty works, <hi>Pſal:</hi> 18. 9,
11. <hi>darkneſſe was under his feet;</hi> men could not
ſee his pathes, &amp;c. He hath <hi>Ends of ſurpriſall,
hardning, and deſtruction</hi> towards ſome, for which
they muſt be left unto their owne ſpirits, and
led into many ſnares and by-pathes, for their
Triall, and the Exerciſe of others, which could
not be accompliſhed, did he not come in the
clouds, and were not <hi>darkneſſe his Pavilion, and
his ſecret place:</hi> on this Account, is that cry of men
of prophane and hardned ſpirits: <hi>Iſai:</hi> 5. 19. Let
him make ſpeed and haſten his work that we
may ſee it, and let the counſell of the holy one
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> draw nigh that we may know it. They
know not what to make, of what they ſee; of all
that as is yet done or accompliſhed, they would
have the whole work out, that they might once
ſee the end of it, and ſo know what to judge:
they would be at a point with him, and not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
kept at thoſe perplexing uncertainties:
and this is another cauſe of the trouble of mens
ſpirits, in conſideration of the diſpenſations of
God: God ſtill keeps a cloud hanging over, and
they know not when it will fall, nor what will be
done in the iſſue of things; this makes ſome wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of waiting on him, and with the profane King
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115368:15"/>
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to cry, <hi>this evill is of the Lord,</hi> there is
no end, confuſion will be the iſſue of all, why
ſhould I abide any longer.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Luſts of men,</hi> doe commonly under
ſuch diſpenſations, fearfully and deſperately tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuate,
to the diſturbance of the moſt ſetled
and weighed ſpirits: <hi>Satan</hi> takes advantage to
draw them out in ſuch a ſeaſon to the utmoſt,
both in <hi>ſpiritualls</hi> and <hi>Civills.</hi> What will be the
conſtant deportment of men of corrupt minds
in ſuch a time, our Saviour ſets forth, <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 8.
They ſhall <hi>come in the name of Chriſt to deceive,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Obad. 12. 13.</note>
               <hi>and ſhall deceive many,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 6.</note> 
               <hi>and cauſe iniquity to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound.</hi>
In ſuch a day <hi>Edom</hi> will appeare an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and <hi>Ephraim</hi> with the ſonne of <hi>Remeliah</hi> will
joyne with <hi>Syriah</hi> for the vexing of <hi>Iudah:</hi> hence
are perplexities, and ſwords piercing through
the very ſoules of men. Take an inſtance in the
daies wherein we live. From the beginning of
the conteſts in this Nation, when God had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
your ſpirits to reſolve, that the Liberties, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,
and Rights of this Nation wherewith
you were intruſted, ſhould not (by his aſſiſtance)
be wreſted out of your hands by violence,
oppreſſion and injuſtice; this he alſo put upon
your hearts, to vindicate and aſſert the Goſpell
of Jeſus Chriſt, his waies and his Ordinances, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all oppoſition, though you were but <hi>inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the way to Syon, with your faces thitherward:</hi>
God ſecretly entwining the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of Chriſt
with yours, wrapt up with you the whole Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſeek his face, &amp; proſpered your
affairs on that accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: ſo that whereas <hi>cauſes</hi> of as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115368:16"/>
clear a righteouſnes among the ſonnes of men as
yours, have come to nothing, yet your underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
hath bin like the <hi>ſheaf of Ioſeph,</hi> in the midſt
of the Nations, which hath <hi>ſtood up,</hi> when all the
others have bowed to the ground: being then
convinced, that your affaires have fallen under
his promiſes, and have come up to an acceptance
before him, ſolely upon the account of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviency
to the Intereſt of Chriſt; God hath put
it into your hearts, to ſeek the propagation of his
Goſpel. What now by the luſts of men is the ſtate
of things? Say <hi>ſome,</hi> there is no Goſpell at all: ſay
<hi>others,</hi> if there be, you have nothing to doe with
it: <hi>ſome</hi> ſay, <hi>loe here is Chriſt;</hi> others <hi>loe there:
ſome</hi> make Religion a colour for one thing; ſome
for another: <hi>ſay ſome,</hi> the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> muſt not
ſupport the <hi>Goſpell;</hi> ſay others, the <hi>Goſpell</hi> muſt
ſubvert the <hi>Magiſtrate:</hi> ſay ſome, your rule is
only for men, as men, you have nothing to doe
with the intereſt of <hi>Chriſt and the Church:</hi> ſay <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
you have nothing to doe to <hi>rule men,</hi> but
upon the account of being Saints. If you will
have the Goſpell, ſay ſome, down with the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of it, <hi>Chemarims, Locuſts, &amp;c.</hi> and if you
will have <hi>light,</hi> take care that you may have ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and darkneſſe: things being carried on
as if it were the care of men, that there might be
no trouble in the World, but what the <hi>name of
Religion</hi> might lye in the bottome of. Now thoſe
that ponder theſe things, their <hi>ſpirits are grieved
in the midſt of their bodies; the viſions of their
heads trouble them,</hi> they looked for other things
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115368:16"/>
from them that profeſſed Chriſt; but the <hi>ſummer
is ended,</hi> and the harveſt is paſt, and we are not
refreſhed. Again; God had ſo ſtated your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
that you were the mark of the <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
World</hi> to ſhoot at, in the beginning; and
their terror in the cloſe: and when you thought
only to have purſued <hi>Sheba</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Bichri,</hi>
the man of your firſt warfare, behold one <hi>Abel</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another, undertakes the quarrell againſt you:
yea ſuch <hi>Abels</hi> as <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Holland;</hi> of whom
we ſaid in old times, <hi>we will enquire of them, and
ſo ended the matter:</hi> and there is not <hi>a wiſe man
or woman among them,</hi> that can diſſwade them:
Strange! that <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſhould joyne with <hi>Syria</hi> to
vexe <hi>Iudah</hi> their brother: that the <hi>Netherlands,</hi>
whoſe being is founded meerely upon the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi>
you have undertaken, ſhould joyne with
the great Anti-Chriſtian intereſt, which cannot
poſſible be ſet up again, without their inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ruine. Hence alſo are deep thoughts of heart,
men are perplexed, diſquieted, and know not
what to doe.</p>
            <p>I could mention other luſts, and tumultua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of the ſpirits of men, that have an influence
into the diſturbance of the hearts of the moſt
pretious in this Nation, but I forbeare.</p>
            <p>4. Mens own Luſts diſquiet their ſpirits in
ſuch a ſeaſon as this: I could inſtance in many,
I ſhall name only foure.</p>
            <p>1. Vnstableneſſe of mind. 2. Carnall feares.
3. Love of the World. 4. Deſire of preheminence.</p>
            <p>1. Unſtableneſſe of mind, which makes men
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115368:17"/>
like the Waves of the Sea that <hi>cannot rest:</hi> the
ſcripture calls it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, tumultuatingneſſe of
ſpirit: there is ſomething of that which <hi>Iude</hi>
ſpeaks of, in better perſons then thoſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes,
<hi>raging like waves of the Sea, and foaming
out their own ſhame,</hi> v. 13. If God give men up to
a <hi>restleſſe ſpirit,</hi> no condition imaginable can
quiet them, ſtill they think they ſee ſomething
beyond it, that is deſireable. <hi>Annibal</hi> ſaid of
<hi>Marcellus,</hi> that he could never be quiet <hi>Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi>
nor <hi>Conquered;</hi> Some mens deſires are ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged,
that nothing can ſatiate them. Wiſe
men that look upon ſundry Godly perſons in
this Nation, and beholding how <hi>every yoake of
the oppreſſor is broken from off their necks,</hi> that
no man makes them afraid, that they are loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
on as <hi>the head, not as the taile,</hi> enjoying the
Ordinances of God according to the light of
their minds, and deſires of their hearts, no man
forbidding them, are ready to wonder, (I ſpeak
of private perſons) what they can find to doe in
their ſeverall places and callings, but to ſerve
the Lord in righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, being
without feare all the daies of their lives. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſe
when poore creatures are <hi>given up,</hi> to the
power of an unquiet, and unſtable mind, they
think ſcarce any thing vile, but <hi>being wiſe unto
ſobriety:</hi> nothing deſirable, but what is without
their proper bounds, and what leads to that
confuſion, which themſelves in the iſſue are leaſt
able of many to undergoe. It is impoſſible but
that mens hearts ſhould be pierced with diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115368:17"/>
and trouble, that are given up to this
frame.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Carnall feares:</hi> theſe even devour and eat
up the hearts of men: what ſhall we doe, what
ſhall become of us; <hi>Ephraim is confederate with
Syria, and the hearts of men are ſhaken, as the
trees of the wood, that are moved with the wind:</hi>
what new troubles ſtill, new unſetlements? This
ſtorme will not be avoided, this will be worſe
then all, that hath befallen us from the youth of
our undertakings. God hath not yet wonne
upon mens ſpirits to truſt him in ſhakings, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities,
alterations: they remember not the
manifeſtations of his wiſdome, power, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in former daies; and how tender hitherto
he hath been of the intereſt of Chriſt, that their
hearts might be eſtabliſhed. Could we but doe
our duty, and truſt the Lord, with the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of his promiſes, what quietneſſe, what
ſweetneſſe might we have? I ſhall not inſtance
in the other particulars: it is too manifeſt, that
many of our piercing and perplexing thoughts,
are from the <hi>tumultuating and diſorder of our
own luſts.</hi> So that what remains of the time allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to me, I ſhall ſpend only in the uſe of this
poynt, and proceed no farther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Of <hi>Inſtruction;</hi> to direct you into
waies and means of quietneſſe, in reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all theſe cauſes and occaſions of piercing, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
thoughts, in ſuch a ſeaſon as this. The
good Lord ſeale up inſtruction to your ſouls,
that you may <hi>know the things that belong to your
Peace,</hi> and what <hi>Iſrael ought to doe</hi> at this, even
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115368:18"/>
at this time: <hi>for my brethrens and companions
ſake, I wiſh you proſperity:</hi> though my own por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhould be in the duſt, for the <hi>true ſpirituall,</hi>
not <hi>imaginary, carnall Interest</hi> of the Church of
God in this Nation, and the Nations about, I
wiſh you proſperity.</p>
            <p>1. Firſt then, in reference to the <hi>Things that
God is doing,</hi> both as to their <hi>Greatneſſe,</hi> and
their <hi>Manner of doing;</hi> whoſe conſideration fills
men with thoughts, that grieve their ſpirits in
the middeſt of their bodies! Would you have
your hearts quieted in this reſpect? Take my
ſecond obſervation for your direction; <hi>The only
way to exstricate and deliver our ſpirits from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſuch perplexities, and intanglements, is to draw
nigh to God in Christ, for the diſcovery of his will.</hi>
So did <hi>Daniel</hi> here in my Text, I feare this is
too much neglected. You take counſell with
your own hearts, you adviſe with one another,
hearken unto men under a <hi>repute of wiſdome;</hi>
and all this doth but increaſe your trouble, you
doe but more and more intangle and diſquiet
your own ſpirits. God ſtands by and ſaies, <hi>I am
wiſe alſo;</hi> and little notice is taken of him: we
think we are grown wiſe our ſelves, and doe not
remember, that we never proſpered, but only
when we went unto God, and told him plainly
we knew not what to doe. <hi>Publique fastings</hi> are
neglected, deſpiſed, ſpoken againſt; and when
appoynted, practiſed according as mens hearts
are principled to ſuch a duty, coldly, deadly,
unacceptably: Life, <hi>heat,</hi> warmth is gone; and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115368:18"/>
ſhall not blood and all goe after? the Lord
prevent it: private meetings are uſed, to ſhew
our ſelves wiſe in the debate of things, with a
forme of Godly words; ſometimes for ſtrife, tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult,
diviſion, diſorder; and ſhall we think there
is much cloſet inquiring after God, when all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
actings of that principle, which ſhould car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
us out thereunto, are oppoſed and ſlighted?
when we doe ſometimes wait upon God, Doe
not many ſeeme to aske amiſſe, to ſpend it on
their luſts; not waiting on him, poor, hungry,
empty, to know his will, to receive direction
from him: but rather going full, fixed, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
ſetled on thoughts, perhaps prejudices of
our own, almoſt taking upon us to preſcribe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Almighty, and to impoſe our poor, low,
carnall thoughts upon his wiſdome and care of
his Church? Oh where is that holy, and that
humble frame, wherewith at firſt, we followed
our God into the Wilderneſſe, where we have
been fed, and cloathed, preſerved and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
for ſo many years. Hence is it that the works
of God are become <hi>strange,</hi> and <hi>terrible,</hi> &amp; <hi>darke</hi>
uuto us: and of neceſſity, ſome of us, many of us,
muſt ſhut up all with diſappoyntment and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row:
We fill our ſoules boldly, confidently,
with croſſe and contrary apprehenſions, of the
Intendments of God, and of the <hi>mediums</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he will accompliſh his ends; and doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
that this is not a frame of men, who had
given up themſelves to the <hi>Alſufficiency of God.</hi>
Some perhaps will ſay, this belongs not unto
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115368:19"/>
them, <hi>they have waited upon God, and they doe
know his mind, and what are the things he will
doe, and are not blind alſo,</hi> nor in the dark as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men. But if it be ſo, what means this <hi>blea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Sheep and Oxen in mine eares?</hi> yea; what
means that roaring and foaming of unquiet
Waves which we heare and ſee: hard ſpeeches,
paſſionate reproaches, ſharp revilings of their
brethren, in boundleſſe confidence, endleſſe
enmity, cauſing evill ſurmiſes, biteing, taring,
devouring termes, and expreſſions, caſting <hi>out
the names of men upright in their Generations, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Lord be praiſed.</hi> When the Lord diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
his mind, and will, it ſetleth the heart, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
the mind, fills the ſoule with reverence
and Godly feare, conformes the heart unto it
ſelfe, fills it with Peace, Love, Meekneſſe, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſſe,
&amp;c. and ſhall we be thought to have
<hi>received the mind, the will of God,</hi> when our
hearts, words, wayes, are full of contrary quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?
Let it be called what it will, I ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to ſhare in that, which would bring my
heart into ſuch a frame; well then, beloved, take
this for your <hi>first direction:</hi> Be more abundant
with God in Faith and Prayer: deale with him
in publick, and private, take counſell of him,
bend your hearts through his grace, to your old
frame, when it was your joy to meet in this
place, which now I feare to many is their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then:
ſeek the Lord and his Face, ſeek him while
he may be found: and hereby;</p>
            <p>1. You will empty your hearts, of many
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115368:19"/>
perplexing contrivances of your own, and you
will find faith in this communion with God, by
little and little working out, killing, ſlaying, theſe
prejudices, &amp; preſumptions which you may be
ſtrong in, that are not according to the will of
God; ſo you be ſure to come not to have your
own Luſts, and carnall conceptions anſwered,
but to have the will of God fulfilled. When
men come unto the Lord to have their owne
<hi>viſions fulfilled,</hi> it is Righteous with God to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
them according to thoſe viſions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
them in them, to their own diſturbance,
and the diſturbance of others.</p>
            <p>2. You <hi>ſhall certainly have peace in your owne
hearts in the Alſufficiency of God:</hi> this he will
give in upon your ſpirits, that what ere he doth,
all his wayes ſhall be to you, mercy, truth, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe,
and peace, yea the diſcoveries which
you ſhall have of his own fulneſſe, ſweetneſſe,
ſuitableneſſe, and the excelleny <hi>of things which
are not ſeen,</hi> will worke your hearts to ſuch a
frame, that you ſhall attend to the things here
below, meerly upon the account of duty, with
the greateſt calmneſſe, and quietneſſe of mind
imaginable.</p>
            <p>3. You ſhall ſurely know your own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
pathes, wherein you ought to walke, in
ſerving God in your Generation, thoſe that
waite upon him <hi>he will guide in judgment:</hi> he
will not leave them in the darke, nor to diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
divided, piercing thoughts: but what ere
others doe, you ſhall be guided into wayes of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115368:20"/>
peace: this you ſhall have when the luſts of men
will let neither the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves, nor others be at quiet.
Oh, then returne to your reſt, looke to him
from whom you have gone aſtray: take no more
diſturbing Counſell with your ſelves, or others;
renew your old frame of humble dependance
on God, and earneſt ſeeking his face; you have
certainly backſliden in this thing.</p>
            <p>Is not the Lord the God of <hi>Counſell and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
as well as the God of <hi>force and power,</hi> that
you run to him when in a ſtreight in your Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but when your counſells ſeem ſometimes to
be mixt with a ſpirit of difficulty and trouble,
he is neglected: only come with humble depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hearts, not every one to bring the Deviſes,
Imaginations, Opinions, Prejudices, and Luſt of
their own hearts before him:</p>
            <p>2. For the troubles that ariſe from the <hi>Luſts
of other men:</hi> and that firſt, about the <hi>Goſpell</hi>
and the <hi>propagation thereof:</hi> the tumultuating of
the Luſts of men in reference hereunto, I gave
you an account of formerly: there are many
peircing thoughts of heart. What <hi>Extreames,</hi> I
had almoſt ſaid <hi>extravigancies,</hi> men have in this
matter run out into, I ſhall now not inſiſt upon:
only I ſhall give you a few directions, for your
own practiſe.</p>
            <p>1. If it once it comes to that, that you ſhall
ſay, you have nothing to doe with <hi>Religion as
Rulers of the Nation,</hi> God will quickly manifeſt
that he hath nothing to doe with you as Rulers
of the Nation: the great promiſe of Chriſt is, that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115368:20"/>
in theſe latter dayes of the world, he will lay
the nations in a ſubſerviency to him, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of the world ſhall become his; that is, act
as kingdomes and Governments no longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, but for him: Surely thoſe promiſes
will ſcarſly be accompliſhed in bringing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths,
of men profeſſing his name, to be
<hi>of Gallio's</hi> frame, to care for none of thoſe things:
Or as the <hi>Turke,</hi> in an abſolute indifferency
what any profeſſe: I mean that are not his own,
for in reſpect of them he <hi>changes</hi> not his God:
not that I would you ſhould goe and ſet up
formes of Government, to compell men to come
under the line of them, or to thruſt in your ſword
to cutt the leſſer differences of brethren;
not that I think Truth ever the more the
Truth, or to have any thing the more of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
upon the conſcience, for having the ſtamp
of your Authority annexed to it, for its allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to paſſe in theſe Nations. Nor doe I ſpeak a
word of what is, may, or may not be incumbent
on you, in reſpect of the moſt profligate oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
of the Truths of the Goſpell: but only this,
that, <hi>not being ſuch as are alwayes learning, never
comming to the knowledge of the truth, but being
fully perſwaded in your own minds,</hi> certainly it is
incumbent on you, to take care that the faith,
which you have received, which was <hi>once deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to the Saints,</hi> in all the neceſſary concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of it, may be protected, preſerved, propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
to and among the people which God hath
ſet you over. If a father as a father is bound to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115368:21"/>
doe what anſwers this in his family, unto his
children; a maſter as a maſter to his ſervants; if
you will juſtifie your ſelves as Fathers, or Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
of your Country, you'll find in your account
this to be incumbent on you.</p>
            <p>2 Take heed, of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that would temper clay &amp;
iron, things that will not mingle, that would
compound carnall and fleſhly things, with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
things and ſpirituall, that they may not
intangle your Spirits: the <hi>great diſigne of graſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
temporall power, upon a ſpirituall account,
will prove at laſt to be the greateſt badge of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt:</hi>
hitherto God hath appeared againſt it,
and will no doubt to the end; if either you, by
the Authority God hath given you in the world,
ſhall take upon you to rule the houſe of God,
as formally ſuch, as his houſe, though you rule
the perſons, whereof ir it made up, or thoſe who
are, or pretend to be of that houſe, to rule the
world on that account, your day &amp; theirs will
be nigh at hand.</p>
            <p>4. Now becauſe you wait on God for directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in reference to the <hi>propagation</hi> of <hi>the Goſpell,</hi>
and the preventing that which is contrary to
<hi>ſound doctrine and godlyneſſe,</hi> I ſhall very briefly
give you to this end, ſome Principles whereon
you may reſt in your <hi>actings;</hi> and ſome rules,
for your diectiron, and ſo draw to a cloſe.</p>
            <p>1. Take in the firſt place what God hath
<hi>promiſed</hi> concerning <hi>Magistrates, Kings, Rulers,
Judges, and Nations, and their ſubſerviency to the
Church;</hi> what God hath promiſed they ſhall doe,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115368:21"/>
that is their duty to doe: he hath not meaſured
out an Inheritance for his people, out of the
ſins of other men: let us a little view ſome of
theſe promiſes, and then conſider their applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the truth we have in hand, and what is
cleared out unto us by them: they are many;
I ſhall inſtance in ſome of the moſt obvious and
eminent. <hi>Eſai. 1. 26. I will restore their Judges and
Prieſts and Councellours as at the beginning:</hi>
it is to <hi>Syon</hi> redeemed, purged, waſhed in the
blood of Chriſt, that this promiſe is made.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eſai.</hi> 49. 7. Kings ſhall ſee and ariſe, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
ſhall bow down themſelves. The <hi>Jewes</hi> being
for the greateſt part of them rejected upon the
comming of Chriſt, this promiſe is made unto
him upon his powring out of the ſpirit, for the
bringing in of the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> as it is farther enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged:
<hi>v. 22, 23. Kings ſhall be thy nurſing Fathers,
and their Queenes thy nurſing Mothers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Iſai: 60. <hi>looks wholy this way: taſte of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and intendment of the whole;</hi> And the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
ſhall come to thy light, and kings to the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of thy riſing. Therefore thy gates ſhall be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
continually, they ſhall not be ſhut day nor night,
that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may bring unto thee the forces of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
and that their kings may be brought. Thou
ſhalt alſo ſuck the milke of the Gentiles, and ſhalt
ſuck the brest of kings, and thou ſhalt know that I
the Lord am thy ſaviour &amp; thy redeemer, the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one
of Jacob. For braſſe I will bring gold, and for
iron I will bring ſilver, and for wood braſſe, and for
stones iron: I will alſo make thy officers peace, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115368:22"/>
thine exactours righteouſneſſe. v. 3. <hi>and the 11.
and the 16. 17. to which adde the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all thoſe promiſes mentioned</hi> Revel. 11
15. <hi>and</hi> 21. 24.</p>
            <p>You ſee here are glorious promiſes, in the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Expreſſion looking directly to what we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
concerning the ſubſerviency of Rulers to the
Goſpell, and the duty of Magiſtrates in ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the intereſt of the Church: let us concerning
them obſerve theſe three things as 1. <hi>to whom
they are made: 2. on what occaſion they are given:
3. what is the ſubject or matter of them in generall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Then they are all given and made to the
Church of Chriſt after his comming in the fleſh,
and his putting an end to all <hi>ceremoniall typicall
carnall</hi> Inſtitutions; for,</p>
            <p>1, They are every where attended with
the circumſtances of <hi>calling the Gentiles,</hi> and
their flowing in to the Church; which were
not accompliſhed till after the deſtruction of
the Iewiſh Church: &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So is the caſe in that which you have <hi>Iſai: 49:
v, 20. The children which thou ſhalt have, after thou
hast lost the other, ſhall ſay againe in thine eares
The place is too straight for me: give place to me
that I may dwell.</hi> It ſhall be when the Church
ſhall have received the new Children of the
Gentiles, having loſt the other of the Iewes:
which he expreſſeth mgre at larg, <hi>v, 22. Thus ſaith
the Lord God, Behold, I will lift up mine hand to
the Gentiles, and ſet up my standard to the people:
and they ſhall bring thy ſonnes in their armes and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115368:22"/>
thy daughters ſhall be carried upon their ſhoulders.</hi>
So alſo are the reſt. When God gives the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to be the inheritance of Chriſt, the Holy
Ghoſt cautions <hi>Rulers, and Judges to kiſſe the ſon,</hi>
&amp; pay the homage due to him in his <hi>Kingdome:
Pſal:</hi> 2: 10: 11:</p>
            <p>2: Becauſe theſe promiſes are pointed unto,
as accompliſhed to the Chriſtian Church in that
place in the Revelation, before mentioned,
<hi>And the ſeaventh angell ſounded, and there were
great voices in heaven, ſaying, The Kingdomes of
this world are become the Kingdomes of our Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and of his Christ, and he ſhall reigne for ever and
ever. Chap: 11: 15: And the nations of them which
are ſaved, ſhall walk in the light of it: and the
Kings of the earth doe bring their glory and honour
into it: Chap:</hi> 21: 24: So that there are plainly
promiſes of Kings and Princes, Iudges, and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
to be given to the Church, and to be made
uſefull thereunto, and Kingdomes and Nations,
people in their Rules and Governments to be
inſtrumentall to the good thereof: ſo that theſe
promiſes belong directly to us, and our Rulers, if
under any notion, we belong to the Church of
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>2. Fot the <hi>Occaſion</hi> of theſe promiſes; it is
well knowne what a truſt by Gods own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
there was inveſted in the Rulers, Judges,
Kings, and Magiſtrates of the judaicall State and
Church under the old Teſtament, in reference
unto the wayes and worſhip of God: the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
and execution of the Laws of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115368:23"/>
his houſe and ſervice being committed
to them; further when they faithfully diſcharg'd
their truſt, promoting the worſhip of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Inſtitutions, incouraging, ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
directing, reproving others, to whom the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
and peculiar adminiſtration of things
ſacred were committed, deſtroying, removing
what ever was an abomination unto the Lord,
it was well with the whole people and Church,
they floriſhed in Peace, and the Lord delighted
in them, and rejoyced over them to doe
them good: and on the other ſide, their neglect
in the diſcharg of their duty, was then common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
attended with <hi>the Apostacy of the Church,</hi>
and great breakings forth of the Indignation
of the Lord: this the Church found in thoſe
dayes and bewailed. To hold out therefore the
happy ſtate of his people, that he would bring
in, he promiſes them ſuch Rulers, and Judges as
he gave at firſt, who faithfully diſcharged the
truſt committed to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not that I ſuppoſe
them bound to the <hi>Moſaicall rules of penalties in
reference to tranſgreſſions and offences against
Goſpell inſtitutions,</hi> but only that a duty in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
is incumbent on them in reference to the
Church and truth of God, which they ſhould
faithfully diſcharge; of which afterward.</p>
            <p>This then being the occaſion of thoſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and their accompliſhment being as before,
in a peculiar manner poynted at, upon the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
calling, and new moulding of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
and Nations of the World, which had
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115368:23"/>
given their power to the Beaſt, and thereupon
framed a new into a due ſubſerviency to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of Chriſt, here is not the leaſt ſhadow or
colour left, for the turning off, and rejecting
the ſweetneſſe of all theſe promiſes, upon an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their being meerely <hi>metaphoricall,</hi> and
ſhadowing out ſpirituall glories: neither their
beginning nor ending, neither their riſe, or fall,
will beare any ſuch gloſſe or corrupting inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation.</p>
            <p>3. As to the matter of theſe promiſes, I
ſhall only aſſert this in generall: that the Lord
ingageth, that <hi>Judges, Rulers, Magistrates;</hi> and ſuch
like, ſhall put forth their power, and act clearly
for the good, welfare, and proſperity of the
Church; This is plainly held out in every one of
them: hence the <hi>Kingdoms are ſaid to ſerve the
Church;</hi> that is all Kingdoms, they muſt doe ſo,
or <hi>be broken in pieces,</hi> and ceaſe to be Kingdoms:
and how can a Kingdome as a Kingdome, (for
it is taken formally, and not materially, meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the individualls of it, as appears by the
threatning of its being broken in pieces,) ſerve
the Church, but by putting forth its power and
ſtrength in her behalfe, <hi>Iſai</hi> 60. 12. and therefore
upon the accompliſhment of that promiſe, they
are ſaid to become the <hi>Kingdoms of the Lord
Christ, Rev.</hi> 11. 15. becauſe, as Kingdoms, they
ſerve him with their Power and Authority; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
before, as ſuch, and by their power, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him to the utmoſt. They muſt nurſe the
Church not with dry breaſts, nor feed it with
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115368:24"/>
ſtones and Scorpions, but with the good things
committed to them. Their <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>ſubstance</hi>
in protection and ſupportment, are to be inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in the behalfe thereof: hence God is ſaid to
give theſe <hi>Judges, Rulers, Princes, Kings, Queenes
to the Church,</hi> not ſetting them in the Church,
as <hi>Officers</hi> thereof, but ordering their ſtate in
the world, <hi>(Rev:</hi> 11. 15.) to its behoofe. In
ſumme, there is not any one of the promiſes
recited, but holds forth the utmoſt of what I
intend to aſſert from them all; <hi>viz.</hi> that the
Lord hath promiſed, <hi>That the Magistrates whom
he will give, own and bleſſe, ſhall put forth their
power, and act in that capacity, wherein he hath
placed them in the World, for the good, furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and proſperity of the truth and Church of
Christ:</hi> they ſhall protect them with their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
feed them with their ſubſtance, adorne them
with their favour, &amp; the priviledges wherewith
they are intruſted: they ſhall break their forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
oppreſſing adverſaries, and take care, that
thoſe who walk in the truth of the Lord, may
<hi>lead a peaceable life in all Godlineſſe and honeſty.</hi>
If then you are ſuch Magiſtrates as God hath
promiſed, (as, woe be unto you if you are not)
know that he hath undertaken for you, that
you ſhall performe this part of your duty, and I
pray that you may rule with him therein, and be
found faithfull.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Second ground</hi> that I would poynt
unto, as a bottome of your actings in this thing
ariſeth from ſundry undoubted principles, which
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115368:24"/>
I ſhall briefly mention: and the Firſt is:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Goſpell of Jeſus Chriſt hath a right to
be Preached and propagated in every Nation, and to
every creature under Heaven.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>is the
Lord of Lords, and King of Kings:</hi> Rev. 17. 14.
<hi>The Nations are given to be his inheritance, and the
utmoſt parts of the Earth to be his poſſeſsion</hi> Pſ. 2.
8, 9. He is appoynted the <hi>Heir of all things,</hi> Heb.
1. 2. God hath ſet <hi>him over the works of his
hands, and put all things in ſubjection under his
feet:</hi> Pſ. 8. 7. And upon this account he gives
commiſſion to his meſſengers, to Preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell
<hi>to all Nations,</hi> Math. 28. 19. Or, <hi>to every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
under Heaven: Mark.</hi> 16. 17. The Nations of
the World, being of the Father given to him, he
may deale with them as he pleaſeth, and either,
<hi>bruiſe them with a rod of Iron, and breake them
in pieces as a Potters veſſell,</hi> Pſ. 2. 9. <hi>He may fill
the places of the Earth with their dead bodies, and
ſtrike in pieces the heads of the Countries. Pſ.</hi> 110.
6. Or he may make them his own, and bring
them in ſubjection unto himſelfe; which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ſome of them he will effect. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 19.
Now the Goſpell being <hi>the rod of his power,</hi> and
<hi>the Scepter of his Kingdome,</hi> the grand inſtrument
whereby he accompliſheth all his deſignes in the
world, <hi>whether they be for life or for death, 2 Cor.</hi>
2. 16. he hath given that a right to take poſſeſſion
in his name, and authority, of all that he will
own in any Nation under Heaven. (And indeed,
he hath in all of them, ſome that are his peculiar
purchaſe. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 9. Whom in deſpight of all the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115368:25"/>
World, he will bring in unto himſelfe.) To have
free paſſage into all Nations, is the undoubted
right of the Goſpell; and the Perſons of Chriſts
goodwill, have ſuch a right to it, &amp; intereſt in it,
that look from whomſoever they may claim
protection in reference unto any other of their
moſt undoubted concernments amongſt men,
of them may they claime protection in reſpect
of their quiet injoyment, and poſſeſſion of the
Goſpell.</p>
            <p>2. That where ever the Goſpell is by any Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
owned, received, embraced, it is the bleſsing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
proſperity and advantage of that Nation:
<hi>They that</hi> love Syon ſhall proſper, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122. 6.
Godlineſſe hath the promiſe of this life, and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
unto all: 1 Tim. 4. 8. <hi>The reception of the
word of truth, and ſubjection to Chriſt therein,
cauſing a people to become</hi> willing in the day of
his power, <hi>entitleth that people to all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
that ever God made to his Church: they
ſhall be</hi> establiſhed in righteouſneſſe, they ſhall be
farre from oppreſſion, and for feare and terrour,
<hi>they ſhall not draw nigh unto them;</hi> whoſoever
contends against ſuch a people, ſhall fall thereby:
no weapon that is formed againſt them ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper,
every tongue that ſhall riſe againſt them in
judgement, they ſhall condemne, for this is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
of the ſervants of the Lord: Iſai. 14. 14,
15, 17. <hi>To the proſperity of a Nation, two
things are required.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That they be freed from oppreſſion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice,
cruelty, diſorder, confuſion in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115368:25"/>
from their rulers, or others.</p>
            <p>2. That they be protected from the ſword
and violence, of them that ſeek their ruine from
without. And both theſe doe a people receive, by
receiving the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>1. For the firſt, they have the promiſe of
God, that they ſhall have <hi>Judges as at the firſt:
Iſa:</hi> 1. 26. Such as in juſtice and judgement ſhall
beare rule over them and among them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the
firſt Judges whom he ſtirred up, and gave to his
ancient people: <hi>Their Officers ſhall be Peace, and
their Exactors righteouſneſſe: Iſai.</hi> 60. 17. even
the very Goſpell which they doe receive, is only
able to inſtruct them to be juſt, ruling in the
feare of the Lord, for that only effectually
teacheth the ſonnes of men, <hi>to live righteouſly,
ſoberly, and Godly in this preſent World: Tit:</hi>
2. 12.</p>
            <p>2. And for the ſecond, innumerable are the
promiſes, that are given to ſuch a people; whence
the Pſalmiſt concludes upon the conſideration
of the mercies, they doe and ſhall enjoy, <hi>happy is
the People whoſe God is the Lord: Pſal: 144. 15. The
glorious God will be to them a place of rivers and
broad waters, in which no Gally with oares, nor
gallant Ship ſhall paſſe by, the Lord will be their
redeemer, Law-giver, King, and Saviour: Iſai:</hi>
33. 21. It will intereſt any people in all the
promiſes, that are made for the uſing of the
Church, to threſh, break, deſtroy, burthen, fire,
conſume, and ſlay the enemies thereof: ſo farre
ſhall a people be from ſuffering under the hands
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115368:26"/>
of oppreſſors, that the Lord will uſe them for
the breaking and deſtruction of the <hi>Nimrods</hi> of
the Earth, and this bleſſing of the Nations doe
they receive by the faith of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The rejection of the Goſpell by any people or
Nation to whom it is tendred, is alwaies attended
with the certain and inevitable deſtruction of that
people or Nation, which ſooner or later, ſhall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any help or deliverance be brought upon them, by
the revenging hand of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>When the word of Grace was rejected and
deſpiſed by the <hi>Jewes,</hi> the meſſengers of it <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly
turning to the Gentiles: Act:</hi> 13. 46. and
chap. 28. v. 28. God removing it from them,
unto <hi>a Nation that would bring forth fruit: Math.
21. 43. As it did in all the World, or among all
Nations,</hi> for a ſeaſon: <hi>Col:</hi> 1. 6, With what a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and tremendous deſolation he quickly wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
that people, is known to all: he quickly
ſlew, and <hi>deſtroyed thoſe Husbandmen,</hi> that ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
his vineyard, and <hi>let it forth</hi> unto others, that
<hi>might bring him his fruit in due ſeaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence, when Chriſt is tendred in the Goſpell,
<hi>the Judges and Rulers of the Nations,</hi> are exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to obedience to him, upon paine of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
upon the refuſall thereof: <hi>Pſal:</hi> 2. 12. And
we have the experience of all Ages, ever ſince
the day, that the Goſpell began to be propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the World: The quarrell of it was reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
on the <hi>Jewes</hi> by the <hi>Romans,</hi> upon the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
by the <hi>Goths, Vandalls,</hi> and innumerable
barbarous Nations; and the vengeance due to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115368:26"/>
the <hi>Antichristian World</hi> is at hand, even at the
doore. The Lord will certainly make good his
promiſe to the utmoſt, that <hi>the Kingdoms and
Nations, which will not ſerve the Church, even
that Kingdome and thoſe Nations ſhall utterly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh:</hi>
Iſai. 60. 12.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>That it is the duty of Magiſtrates to ſeeke
the good, peace, and proſperity of the people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to their charge, and to prevent, obviate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move,
take away every thing, that will bring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
deſtruction, deſolation upon them:</hi> as <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai
procured good things for his people, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
to his kindred: Eſther.</hi> 10. 4. And <hi>David</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes
himſelfe with all earneſtneſſe, purſuing
the ſame deſigne, <hi>Pſ:</hi> 101. Magiſtrates <hi>are the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of God for the good,</hi> (univerſall good) of
them to whom they are given, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 14. and
they are <hi>to watch and apply themſelves to this very
thing:</hi> v. 6. And the reaſon the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> gives to
ſtirre up the Saints of God to pray amongſt all
ſorts of men, in ſpeciall for Kings, and thoſe that
are in Authority, to wit, that they may in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
come to the knowledge of the faith, and be
ſaved, and in particular diſcharge the duty and
truſt committed to them (for on that account are
they to pray for them, as Kings and men in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority)
is, that we may <hi>lead a quiet and peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
life in all Godlineſſe &amp; honeſty: 1 Tim:</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3,
4. It being incumbent on them, to act even as
<hi>Kings and men in Authority,</hi> that we may ſo doe:
they are to <hi>feed the people committed to their
charge with all their might,</hi> unto univerſall peace,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115368:27"/>
and welfare: now the things that are oppoſite
to the good of any Nation or people, are of
two ſorts. Firſt; ſuch as are really, directly, and
immediatly oppoſed to that ſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
wherein they cloſe together, and find pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity.
In generall, ſeditions, tumults, diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
In particular, violent, or fraudulent brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
in upon the reſpective deſigned bounds,
priviledges, and enjoyments of ſingular perſons,
without any conſideration of him who ruleth all
things, are of this kind: If Nations and rulers
might be ſuppoſed to be Atheiſts, yet ſuch evills
as theſe, tending to their diſſolution, and not
being, they would with all their ſtrength labour
to prevent, either by watching againſt their
commiſſion, or inflicting vengeance on them
that commit them, that others may heare, and
feare, and doe ſo no more.</p>
            <p>2. Such as are morally and meritoriouſly
oppoſed to their good and wellfare; in that they
will certainly pluck down the judgements and
wrath of God upon that Nation or people,
where they are practiſed, and allowed: there are
ſinnes for which the <hi>wrath of God will be aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
revealed from heaven, against the children of
diſobedience: Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> are ſet forth
as examples of his righteous judgement in this
kind. And ſhall he be thought a <hi>Magistrate,</hi> to
beare out the name, authority, and preſence of
God to men, that ſo he, and his people, have
preſent peace, like a heard of Swine, cares not,
though ſuch things as will certainly, firſt eat and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115368:27"/>
devoure their ſtrength, and then utterly conſume them,
doe paſſe for currant: ſeeing that they that <hi>rule over
men, must be just, ruling in the feare of the Lord,</hi> the ſole
reaſon why they ſheath the ſword of juſtice in the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells
of Theeves, Murtherers, Adulterers, is not becauſe
their outward peace is actually diſturbed by them, and
therefore they muſt give example of terrour to others,
who being like minded, yet are not yet actually given
up to the practice of the like abomination, but alſo, yea
principally, becauſe he in whoſe ſtead they ſtand and
miniſter to the World, is provoked by ſuch wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to deſtroy both the one and the other: And if
there be the ſame reaſon to be evidenced concerning
other things, they alſo call for the ſame procedure.</p>
            <p>To gather up now what hath been ſpoken: conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Goſpells right and title, <hi>to be propagated with all
its concernments, in every Nation under heaven, the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
peace, proſperity, and protection wherewith it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
when, and where received, and the certain destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and deſolation, which accompanies the rejection and
contempt thereof, conſidering the duty that by Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyntment,
is incumbent on them that rule over men, that
in the feare of the Lord they ought to ſeek the good, peace,
and wellfare, and proſperity of them committed to their
charge; to prevent, obviate, remove, revenge that which
tends to their hurt, perturbation, diſſolution, deſtruction,
immediate from heaven, or from the hand of men, and in
the whole adminiſtration to take care, that the worſhippers
of God in Chriſt, may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all
godlineſſe and honeſty,</hi> let any one, who hath the leaſt
ſenſe upon his ſpirit, of the account which he muſt one
day make to the great King and Judge of all the
World, of the Authority and power wherewith he
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115368:28"/>
was intruſted, determine, whether it be not incumbent
on him by all the <hi>protection,</hi> he can afford, by all the
<hi>priviledges</hi> he <hi>can indulge,</hi> the <hi>ſupportment</hi> that he can
grant, by all that <hi>incouragement,</hi> which upon the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
account imaginable, he is required or allowed to
give to any perſon whatſoever, to further the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Goſpell, which upon the matter is the only
thing of concernment, as well unto this life, as that
which is to come. And if any thing be allowed in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which in Gods eſteeme may amount to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
and deſpiſing thereof, men may be taught by
ſad experience, what will be the iſſue of ſuch allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>3. I ſhall only propoſe one thing more to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.
<hi>Although the Inſtitutions and Examples of the
old Teſtament, of the duty of Magiſtrates, in the things
and about the worſhip of God, are not in their whole lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi>
and extent to be drawn into rules, that ſhould be
obligatory to all Magiſtrates now under the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of the Goſpell; and that becauſe the Magiſtrate
then was <hi>cuſtos, vindex, &amp; adminiſtrator legis judicia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,
&amp; politiae Moſaicae,</hi> from which as moſt think we are
freed; yet doubtleſſe there is ſomething morall in thoſe
Inſtitutions, which being uncloathed of their <hi>judaicall
forme,</hi> is ſtill binding to all in the like kind, as to ſome
<hi>Analogie</hi> and proportion: ſubduct from thoſe Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations,
what was proper to, and lyes upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Church and Nation of the Jewes, and what
remains, upon the generall notion of a Church and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
muſt be everlaſtingly binding: and this amounts
thus farre at leaſt, that <hi>Judges, Rulers,</hi> and <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi>
which are promiſed under the New Teſtament, to be
given in mercy, and to be of ſingular uſefulneſſe, as the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115368:28"/>
Judges were under the Old, are to take care that the
Goſpell Church, may in its concernment as ſuch, be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
and promoted, &amp; the truth propagated, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they are intruſted; as the others took care, that it
might be well with the <hi>Judaicall Church,</hi> as ſuch. And
on theſe and ſuch like principles as theſe are, may you
ſafely bottome your ſelves in that undertaking, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you ſeek for direction from God this day.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>rules</hi> which I intimated I ſhall but name
them,<note place="margin">Diſc. of Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> having ſome years ſince delivered my thoughts
to the World at large in this ſubject; and I ſee no cauſe
as yet to recede from any thing then ſo delivered. Take
only then for the preſent, theſe briefe directions fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p>1. Labour to be <hi>fully perſwaded in your own minds,
that you be not carried up and down with every wind of
Doctrine,</hi> and be tempted to harken after every ſpirit,
as though you had received no truth, as it is in <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
It is a ſad condition, when men have no zeale for truth,
nor againſt that which is oppoſite to it, what ever they
ſeem to profeſſe; becauſe indeed having not taken in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
truth in the power and principle of it, they are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſad thoughts, wholly at a loſſe, whether there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
truth or no: this is an unhappy frame indeed, the
proper condition of them whom <hi>God will ſpew out of his
mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Know that error and falſhood have no Right or
Title, either from God, or man, unto any priviledge,
protection, advantage, liberty, or any good thing, you
are intruſted withall: to diſpoſe that unto a lye, which
is the right of &amp; due to truth, is to deale treacherouſly
with him by whom you are employed: all the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and forbearance unto ſuch perſons as are infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115368:29"/>
with ſuch abominations, is ſoly upon a civill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
and that <hi>plea</hi> which they have for tranquillity,
whileſt neither directly nor morally they are a diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
unto others.</p>
            <p>3. Know that in things of practice, ſo of perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that
are impious and wicked, either in themſelves or in their
naturall &amp; unconſtrained conſequences, the plea of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi>
is an Aggravation of the crime: if mens conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
are ſeared, and themſelves given up to a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
mind, to doe thoſe things that are not convenient,
there is no doubt but they ought to ſuffer ſuch things,
as to ſuch practiſes are aſſigned and appoynted.</p>
            <p>Should I now deſcend unto particulars, in all the
things mentioned, and inſiſt on them, time would
wholly faile me, neither is it a work for a ſingle Sermon:
and therefore in one word I ſhall wind up the whole
matter and end.</p>
            <p>Know them then, that are faithfull and quiet in the
Land, regard the truth of the Goſpell: remember the
daies of old, what hath done you good, quieted your
hearts in diſtreſſe, crown'd your undertakings with
ſweetneſſe: looſe not your firſt love: draw not out
your own thoughts for the counſell of God: ſeek not
great things for your ſelves: be not moved at the luſts
of men, keep Peace what in you lyeth, with all that
feare the Lord: let the glory of Chriſt, be the end of all
your undertakings. &amp;c.</p>
