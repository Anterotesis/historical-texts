            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

My Lord, theſe were the inducements which ſet me upon this attempt, it being the ſubject of the Book, to clear and aſſert an important truth, which is as a Criterion whereby to know the Sons of the Church of <hi>England</hi> from her Adverſaries on both hands, thoſe that adore, and thoſe that profane the bleſſed Sacrament; theſe that deſtroy the viſible Sign, and thoſe that deny the inviſible Grace: I thought I might juſtly offer it to ſo pious and ſo great a Son of this Church, who own'd

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now nineteen years ſince this Hiſtorical Treatiſe was made by the Right Reverend Father in God <hi>John Coſin,</hi> when (in the time of the late accurſed Rebellion) he was an Exile in <hi>Paris</hi> for his Loyalty and Religion's ſake; for being then commanded to remain in that City by his gracious Majeſty that now is, (who was departing into <hi>Germany</hi> by reaſon of a League newly made by the <hi>French</hi> King with our wicked Rebels) he was alſo ordered by him, as he had been before by his bleſſed Father, <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, a Prince never enough to be commended, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Divine Offices in the Royal Chappel, and to endeavour to keep and confirm in the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, profeſſed by the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lang,</hi> his fellow-Exiles, both of the Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and others his Country-men who then lived
<pb facs="tcp:65834:5"/>
in that place. Now the occaſion of his writing this Piece was this: when his Gracious Majeſty had choſen <hi>Colen</hi> for the place of his reſidence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſolemnly invited, he viſited a neighbouring Potent Prince of the Empire, of the Roman Perſwaſion; where it fell out, as it doth uſually where Perſons of different Religions do meet; ſome Jeſuits began to diſcourſe of Controverſies with thoſe Noblemen and Worthies, (who never forſook their Prince in his greateſt ſtraights, but were his conſtant Attendants, and Imitators of his ever conſtant Profeſſion of the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion) charging the Church of <hi>England</hi> with Hereſie, eſpecially in what concerns the Bleſſed Sacrament of the Lords Supper. They would have it, that our Church holds no real, but only a kind of imaginary preſence of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt; but that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> retained ſtill the very ſame faith concerning this ſacred Myſtery, which the Catholick Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly maintained in all Ages; to wit, that the whole ſubſtance of the Bread and wine is changed into the ſubſtance of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, and right-well called Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> This, and much more to the ſame purpoſe was pronounced by the Jeſuits, in preſence of His Majeſty and the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Prince, with as much poſitiveneſs and confidence, as if it had been a clear and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident truth owned by all the Learned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65834:5"/>
His Sacred Majeſty, and his Noble Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants knew well enough that the Jeſuits did ſhameleſly belie the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that their brags about Roman Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation were equally falſe and vain: But the German Prince having recommended to the peruſal of thoſe Honourable Perſons that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the King a Manuſcript wherein (as he ſaid) was proved by Authentick Authors all that had been advanced by the Jeſuits. They thought it fit to acquaint the Reverend Dr. <hi>Coſin</hi> with the whole buſineſs, and intreat him that he would vindicate the Church of <hi>England</hi> from the Calumny, and plainly declare what is her avowed Doctrine and belief about the true and real Preſence of Chriſt in the Bleſſed Sacrament. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon our worthy Doctor, who was ever rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and zealous to do good, eſpecially when it might benefit the Church of God, fell pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to work, and writ this excellent Treatiſe as an Anſwer to the Prince's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript, that if thoſe worthy Perſons plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed they might repay his Highneſs kindneſs in kind: Yet notwithſtanding the ſolicitations of thoſe that occaſioned it, and of others that had peruſed it, he would not yield to have it made publick while a few months before he died; becauſe having compoſed it for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Friends, he thought it ſufficient, that
<pb facs="tcp:65834:6"/>
it had been uſeful to them. But the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie about the Preſence of Chriſt in the Euchariſt, being of late years reſumed with much vigour, and even now famous by the learned and eloquent Diſputes of Monſieur <hi>Claude,</hi> Miniſter of the Reformed Church in <hi>Paris,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Arnold</hi> Doctor of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> and others, who moved by their example, have entred the Liſts. The reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and more earneſt importunities of his friends obtained at laſt his conſent for the publication of this Work; and the rather, becauſe he thought that the Error conſtantly maintained by the famous Doctor of <hi>Sorbon</hi> was by a lucky anticipation clearly and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confuted throughout this Book, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Fathers have ſaid about the true and real Preſence of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt in the Sacrament, that ſtout <hi>Roman</hi> Champion applies to his Tranſubſtantiation, and then crows over his Adverſaries ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that he hath utterly overthrown the Proteſtants cauſe; whereas there is ſuch a wide difference, as may be called <hi>a great Gulf fixed</hi> betwixt the true or real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt in the Lords Supper, and the Tranſubſtantiation of the Bread and Wine into his Body and Bloud. This laſt is ſuch a Prodigie as is neither taught by Scripture, nor poſſible to be apprehended by faith; it is
<pb facs="tcp:65834:6"/>
repugnant to right reaſon, and contrary to ſenſe; and is no where to be found in Ancient Writers: But the other is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Scripture, and to the Analogy of faith; it is not againſt Reaſon, although be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpiritual it cannot be perceived by our bodily ſenſes, and it is back'd by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and unanimous Doctrine of the holy Fathers. For it makes nothing againſt it, that ſometimes the ſame Fathers do ſpeak of the Bread and Wine of the holy Euchariſt as of the very Body and Bloud of Chriſt, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a manner of ſpeech very proper and uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in ſpeaking of Sacraments to give to the ſign the name of the thing ſignified: And however they explain themſelves in other places, when they frequently enough call the Sacramental Bread and Wine Types, Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols, Figures, and Signs of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt; thereby declaring openly for us againſt the Maintainers of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation. For we may ſafely, without any prejudice to our Tenet uſe thoſe Expreſſions of the Ancients which the Papiſts think to be moſt favourable to them, taking them in a Sacramental ſenſe, as they ought to be; whereas, the laſt mentioned, that are againſt them, none can uſe, but by ſo doing he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily deſtroys the whole contrivance of Tranſubſtantiation, it being altogether incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
<pb facs="tcp:65834:7"/>
to ſay, the Bread is ſubſtantially changed into the Body of Chriſt, and the Bread is a Figure, a Sign, and a Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Body of Chriſt. For, what hath loſt its being can in no wiſe ſignifie, or repreſent any other thing: Neither was ever any thing ſaid to repreſent and be the Figure and Sign of it ſelf. But this is more at large treated of in the Book it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Now having given an account of the occaſion of writing and publiſhing this Diſcourſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Reader will expect that I ſhould ſay ſomething of its excellent Author: But ſhould I now undertake to ſpeak but of the moſt memorable things that concern this great Man, my thoughts would be overwhelmed with their multitude, and I muſt be inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious both to him and my Readers, being confined within the narrow limits of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face. But what cannot be done here may be done ſomewhere elſe, God willing. This only I would not have the Reader to be ignorant of, That this Learned man and (as appears by this) conſtant Profeſſor and Defendor of the Proteſtant Religion was one of thoſe who was moſt vehemently accuſed of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by the Presbyterians before the late Wars, and for that reaſon bitterly perſecuted by them, and forced to forſake his Country; whereby he ſecured himſelf from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb facs="tcp:65834:7"/>
of their Hands, but not of their Tongues; for ſtill the good men kept up the noiſe of their clamorous Accuſation even while he was writing this moſt ſubſtantial Treatiſe againſt Tranſubſtantiation.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>1. The Real, that is, true and not imaginary Preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is proved by Scripture. 2 and 3. Yet this favours not the Tenet of Tranſubſtantiation, being it is not to be underſtood groſly and carnally, but ſpiritually and Sacramentally. 4. The nature and uſe of the Sacraments. 5. By means of the Elements of Bread and Wine, Chriſt himſelf is ſpiritually eaten by the Faithful in the Sacrament. 6.

               </note> we cannot, and ought not, either excuſe or ſuffer him in our Churches: for we muſt embrace and hold for an undoubted truth whatever is taught by Divine Scripture. And therefore we can as little doubt of what Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Joh. 6. 55 My fleſh is meat indeed, and my bloud is drink indeed;</hi> which, according to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> are both given to us by the conſecrated Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: For he calls the Bread, <hi>the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Chriſts Body,</hi> and the Cup, <hi>the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Communion of his bloud.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence it is moſt evident that the Bread and Wine (which according to St. <hi>Paul</hi> are the Elements of the holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt) are neither changed as to their ſubſtance, nor vaniſht, nor reduc'd to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but are ſolemnly conſecrated by the words of Chriſt, that by them his bleſſed body and bloud may be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to us.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:65834:9"/>
3. And further it appears from the ſame words, that the expreſſion of Chriſt and the Apoſtle, is to be underſtood in a Sacramental and myſtick ſenſe; and that no groſs and carnal preſence of body and bloud can be maintained by them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And though the word <hi>Sacrament</hi> be no where uſed in Scripture to ſignifie the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Euchariſt, yet the Chriſtian Church, ever ſince its Primitive ages, hath given it that name, and always called the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſts body and bloud therein, Myſtick and Sacramental. Now a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental expreſſion doth, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, give to the ſign the name of <note place="margin">Exod. 12. 21. 1 Cor. 10. 3, 4.</note> the thing ſignified: And ſuch is as well the uſual way of ſpeaking, as the nature of Sacraments, that not only the names, but even the properties and effects of what they repreſent and exhibite, are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the outward Elements. Hence (as I ſaid before) the Bread is as clearly as poſitively called by the Apoſtle, <hi>the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the body of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. This alſo ſeems very plain, that our Bleſſed Saviour's deſign was not ſo much to teach, what the Elements of Bread and Wine are by nature and ſubſtance, as what is their uſe and office and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in this Myſtery: For the body and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65834:10"/>
bloud of our Saviour are not only fitly repreſented by the Elements, but alſo, by vertue of his inſtitution really offered to all, by them, and ſo eaten by the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Myſtically and Sacramentally; whence it is, that <hi>he truly is and abides in us, and we</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 56.</note> 
               <hi>in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. This is the ſpiritual (and yet no leſs true and undoubted than if it were corporal) eating of Chriſt's fleſh, not indeed ſimply as it is fleſh, without any other reſpect (for ſo it is not given, neither would it profit us) but as it is crucified and <hi>given</hi> for the redemption of the <note place="margin">Mat. 20. 26.</note> world; neither doth it hinder the truth and ſubſtance of the thing, that this eating of Chriſt's body is ſpiritual, and that by it the ſouls of the Faithful, and not their ſtomachs, are fed by the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Ghoſt: For this none can deny, but they who being ſtrangers to the Spirit and the divine vertue, can ſavour only carnal things, and to whom, what is Spiritual and Sacramental, is the ſame as if a meer nothing.</p>
            <p n="7">7. As to the manner of the preſence of the body and bloud of our Lord in the Bleſſed Sacrament, we that are Proteſtant and Reformed according to the ancient Catholick Church, do not ſearch into

the manner of it with perplexing inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; but, after the example of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and pureſt Church of Chriſt, we leave it to the power and wiſdom of our Lord, yielding a full and unfeined aſſent to his words: Had the Romiſh main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of Tranſubſtantiation done the ſame, they would not have determined and decreed, and then impoſed as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of faith abſolutely neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, a manner of preſence, newly by them invented, under pain of the moſt direful Curſe, and there would have been in the Church leſs wrangling, and more peace and unity than now is.</p>

Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in that point. In the firſt place it ſhews, <hi>that the holy Euchariſt is not only the figure, but alſo contains in it ſelf the truth, nature, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the body of our bleſſed Saviour; and that thoſe words, nature and ſubſtance ought not to be rejected, becauſe the Fathers uſed them in ſpeaking of that Myſtery.</hi> Secondly, He inquires whether thoſe expreſſions, truth, nature, and ſubſtance <hi>were uſed in this Myſtery by the Ancients, in their common acceptation, or in a ſenſe more particular and proper to the Sacraments? Becauſe we muſt not only obſerve what words they uſed, but alſo what they meant to ſignifie and to teach by them.</hi> And though with the Fathers he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged a difference, betwixt the body of Chriſt in its natural form of a humane body, and that Myſtick body preſent in the Sacrament, yet he choſe rather to put that difference <hi>in the manner of preſence and exhibition,</hi> than <hi>in the ſubject it ſelf, that is, the real body and bloud of our Saviour;</hi> being it is moſt certain, that no other body is given to the faithful in the Sacrament than that which was by Chriſt given to death for their Redemption.

And as to what regards this Myſtery, the <note n="a" place="margin">Bilſ. reſp. ad Card.

We hold by a firm belief that it is the body of Chriſt, of the manner how it comes to be ſo there is not a word in the Goſpel; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Scripture is ſilent in this, we juſtly diſown it to be a matter of Faith: We may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed rank it among Tenets of the School, but by no means, among the Articles of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Belief. We like well of what</hi> Durandus <hi>is reported to have ſaid, [We hear the Word, and feel the motion, we know not the manner, and yet believe the Preſence:] For we believe a Real Preſence no leſs than you do. We dare not

be ſo bold as preſumptuouſly to define any thing concerning the manner of a true Preſence, or rather, we do not ſo much as trouble our ſelves with being inquiſitive about it; no more than in Baptiſm, how the bloud of Chriſt waſheth us; or in the Incarnation of our Redeemer, how the Divine and Humane Nature were united together. We put it in the number of ſacred things or Sacrifices, (the Euchariſt it ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Sacred Myſtery) whereof the remnants ought to be conſumed with fire, that is, (as the Fathers elegantly have it) ador'd by faith, but not ſearcht by reaſon.</hi>

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he departed, he was, by order from the King, queſtioned by ſome Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionated Biſhops what he thought of the Religion and Church of <hi>England,</hi> which for ſo many years he had owned and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and what he would ſay of it in the <hi>Roman</hi> Court: to this Query he gave in writing this memorable anſwer, <hi>I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, even with the danger of my life, to profeſs before the Pope himſelf, that the Church of</hi> England <hi>is a true and Orthodox Church of

Chriſt.</hi> This he not only promiſed but faithfully performed, for though, ſoon after his departure, there came a Book out of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> falſly bearing his name, by whoſe title many were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived even among the Engliſh, and thereby moved to tax him with Apoſtacy, and of being another <hi>Eubolius;</hi> yet when he came to <hi>Rome</hi> (where he was moſt kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertained in the Palace of Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory the Fifteenth,</hi> who formerly had been his Fellow-ſtudent) he could never be perſwaded by the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and others who daily thronged upon him, neither to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the new-deviſed-Tenets of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> or to retract thoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Books which he had Printed in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> or to renounce the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in whoſe defence he conſtantly perſiſted to the very laſt.

Item</hi> (Numb. 73.) <hi>the true and real Body of Chriſt is moſt certainly and undoubtedly given in the holy Sacrament, yet not carnally, but Spiritually.</hi> Again (Numb. 169.) <hi>I doubt not, but all they that believe the Goſpel, will acknowledge that in the holy Communion we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the true nature of the fleſh of Chriſt, real and ſubſtantial. We all teach that the body of Chriſt is preſent as to its reality and nature, but a carnal and corporal manner of preſence we reject with St.</hi> Bernard, <hi>and all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> And in <hi>Appen. ad Ambroſium,</hi> Numb. 7. <hi>I know and acknowledge that with the Bread ſtill remaining bread, the true and real body of Chriſt is given, yet not corporally: I aſſent in the thing, but not in the manner. Therefore though there is a change in the Bread, when it brings into the Souls of worthy Communicants, the true body of Chriſt which is the ſubſtance of the Sacrament: Yet it doth not follow that the Bread loſeth its own, to become the ſubſtance of the body of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65834:21"/>
and Myſtically, by vertue of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Union; which conſiſteth not in a bare ſignification or obligation only, but alſo in a real exhibition and communication of both parts, earthly and heavenly, together at once, though in a different manner.</hi> 3. In that ſenſe they affirm with the Ancients, <hi>That the Bread and Wine are changed into the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, not in nature and ſubſtance, but in uſe and efficacy; in which reſpect the ſacred Elements are not called what they are to ſenſe, but what they are believed and received by faith grounded on the Promiſe.</hi> 4. They deny <hi>to believe the ſigns to be bare, inefficacious, and empty, but rather ſuch as truly give what they ſeal and ſignifie, being efficacious inſtruments and moſt certain means whereby the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, and ſo, Chriſt himſelf with all his benefits, is ſet forth and offered to all Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants, but conferred and given to true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and by them received as the ſaving and vivifying food of their Souls.</hi> 5.

               </note> 
               <hi>the words of Chriſt; that he doth not only offer us the benefits of his Death and Reſurrection, but his very body, wherein he died and roſe again.

               <hi>mock us; and except one preſumes to call God a deceiver be will never dare to ſay, that the Symbols are empty, and that Chriſt is not in them. Therefore if by the breaking of the bread our Saviour doth repreſent the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his body, it is not to be doubted but that he truly gives and confers it. If it be true that the viſible ſign is given us, to ſeal the gift of an inviſible thing, we muſt firmly believe, that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65834:22"/>
receiving the ſigns of the body, we alſo certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive the body it ſelf. Setting aſide all ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities, I do willingly admit all thoſe terms that can moſt ſtrongly expreſs the true and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Communication of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, granted to the Faithful with the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols of the Lords Supper; and that, not as if they received only by the force of their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or an act of their minds, but really, ſo as to be fed thereby unto Eternal life.</hi> Again, <note place="margin">Treat. of the Lords Supper.</note>

This certainly, if there were nothing elſe, ſhould abundantly ſatisfie us, that we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that Chriſt, in his Holy Supper, gives us the true and proper ſubſtance of his Body and Bloud, that it being wholly ours, we may be made partakers of all his benefits and graces.</hi> Again, <hi>The Son of God offers daily to us in the holy Sacrament, the ſame body which he once offered in ſacrifice to his Father, that it may be our ſpiritual food.</hi> In theſe he aſſerts, as clearly as any one can, the true, <hi>Real,</hi> and ſubſtantial Preſence and Communication of the Body of Chriſt, but how, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes not to determine. <hi>If any one</hi>

               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:65834:25"/>
that the preſence of the body of Chriſt in the Sacrament, is ſpiritual, and therefore true and real; and with the ſame <hi>Bernard,</hi> and all the Ancients, we deny that the Body of Chriſt is carnally either preſent or given. The thing we willingly admit, but humbly and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly forbear to enquire into the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We believe a Preſence and Union of Chriſt with our ſoul and body, which we know not how to call better than Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, that is, effected by eating; that while we eat and drink the conſecrated Bread and Wine, we eat and drink there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, not in a corporal manner, but ſome other way, incomprehenſible, known only to God, which we call ſpiritual; for if with St. <hi>Bernard</hi> and the Fathers a man goes no further, we do not find fault with a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral explication of the manner, but with the preſumption and ſelf-conceitedneſs of thoſe who boldly and curiouſly inquire what is a ſpiritual preſence, as preſuming that they can underſtand the manner of acting of Gods holy Spirit. We contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe confeſs with the Fathers, that this manner of preſence is unaccountable, and paſt finding out, not to be ſearcht and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65834:25"/>
pried into by Reaſon, but believed by Faith. And if it ſeems impoſſible that the fleſh of Chriſt ſhould deſcend, and come to be our food, through ſo great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; we muſt remember how much the power of the holy Spirit exceeds our ſenſe and our apprehenſions, and how abſurd it would be to undertake to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure his Immenſity by our weakneſs and narrow capacity; and ſo make our Faith to conceive and believe what our Reaſon cannot comprehend.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Yet our Faith doth not cauſe or make that Preſence, but apprehends it as moſt truly and really effected by the word of Chriſt: And the Faith whereby we are ſaid to eat the fleſh of Chriſt, is not that only whereby we believe that he died for our ſins (for this Faith is required and ſuppoſed to precede the Sacramental Manducation) but more properly, that whereby we believe thoſe words of Chriſt, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> which was St. <hi>Auſtins</hi>

5. The reſult of all this is, That the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Bloud of Chriſt are Sacramental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united to the Bread and Wine, ſo that Chriſt is truly given to the Faithful; and yet is not to be here conſidered with ſenſe or worldly reaſon, but by Faith, reſting on the words of the Goſpel. Now it is ſaid, that the Body and Bloud of Chriſt are joyned to the Bread and Wine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, that in the celebration of the holy Euchariſt, the Fleſh is given together with the Bread, and the Bloud together with the Wine. All that remains is, That we ſhould with faith and humility admire this high and ſacred Myſtery, which our tongue cannot ſufficiently explain, nor our heart conceive.</p>

            </argument>
            <p n="1">1. IT is an Article of faith in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that in the Bleſſed Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt the ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine is reduced to nothing, and that in its place ſucceeds the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, as we ſhall ſee more at large § 6,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65834:27"/>
and 7. The Proteſtants are much of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mind; and yet none of them denies altogether but that there is a converſion of the Bread into the Body (and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of the Wine into the Bloud) of Chriſt: For they know and acknowledge that in the Sacrament, by vertue of the words and bleſſing of Chriſt, the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, uſe, and office of the Bread is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changed, that is, of common and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, it becomes our Myſtical and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental food; whereby, as they affirm and believe, the true Body of Chriſt is not only ſhadowed and figured, but alſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven indeed, and by worthy Communicants truly received. Yet they believe not that the bread loſeth its own, to become the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Body of Chriſt; for the holy Scripture, and the ancient Interpreters thereof for many ages, never taught ſuch an Eſſential change and converſion, as that the very ſubſtance, the matter and form of the Bread ſhould be wholly taken away, but only a myſterious and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental one, whereby our Ordinary is changed into Myſtick bread, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by deſigned and appointed to another uſe, end, and office than before: This change, whereby ſupernatural effects are wrought by things natural, while their
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65834:27"/>
Eſſence is preſerved entire, doth beſt agree with the grace and power of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is no reaſon why we ſhould diſpute concerning Gods Omnipotency, whether it can do this or that, preſuming to meaſure an infinite power by our poor ability which is but weakneſs. We may grant that he is able to do beyond what we can think or apprehend, and reſolve his moſt wonderful acts into his abſolute will and power, but we may not charge him with working contradictions. And though Gods Almightineſs were able in this Myſtery to deſtroy the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine, and eſſentially to change it into the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, while the accidents of Bread and Wine ſubſiſt of themſelves without a ſubject, yet we deſire to have it proved that God will have it ſo, and that it is ſo indeed. For, that God doth it becauſe he can, is no Argument; and that he wills it, we have no other proof but the confident Aſſertion of our Adverſaries. <hi>Tertullian</hi> againſt <hi>Praxias</hi> declared, <hi>That we ſhould not conclude God doth things becauſe he is able, but that we ſhould enquire what he hath done;</hi> For God will never own that praiſe of his Omnipotency, whereby his unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65834:28"/>
and his truth are impaired, and thoſe things overthrown and deſtroy'd, which, in his word, he affirms to be; for, take away the Bread and Wine, and there remains no Sacrament.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They that ſay, that the matter and form of the Bread are wholly aboliſhed, yet will have the accidents to remain: But if the ſubſtance of the Bread be changed into the ſubſtance of Chriſts Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, by vertue of his words, what hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that the accidents of the Bread are not alſo changed into the accidents of Chriſts Body? They that urge the expreſs Letter, ſhould ſhew that Chriſt ſaid, This is the ſubſtance of my Body without its accidents. But he did not ſay, That he gave his Diſciples a Phantaſtick Body, ſuch a viſionary figment as <hi>Marcion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, but that very Body which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for us, without being deprived of that extention and other accidents of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane bodies without which it could not have been crucified, ſince the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of Tranſubſtantiation grant that the Body of Chriſt keeps its quantity in Heaven, and ſay it is without the ſame in the Sacrament; they muſt either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their contradiction in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or give over their opinion.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:65834:28"/>
4. Proteſtants dare not be ſo curious, or preſume to know more than is delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Scripture and Antiquity, they firmly believing the words of Chriſt, make the form of this Sacrament to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the Union of the thing ſignified with the ſign, that is, the exhibition of the Body of Chriſt with the conſecrated bread, ſtill remaining bread; by divine appointment theſe two are made one; and though this Union be not natural, ſubſtantial, perſonal, or local by their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one within another, yet it is ſo ſtraight and ſo true, that in eating the bleſſed Bread, the true body of Chriſt is given to us, and the names of the ſign and thing ſignified are reciprocally changed, what is proper to the body is attributed to the bread, and what belongs only to the bread, is affirmed of the body, and both are united in time, though not in place. For the preſence of Chriſt in this Myſtery is not oppoſed to diſtance but to abſence, which only could deprive us of the benefit and fruition of the object.</p>
            <p n="5">5. From what hath been ſaid it appears, that this whole controverſie may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to four Heads; 1. Concerning the Signs; 2. Concerning the thing ſignified;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65834:29"/>
3. Concerning the Union of both; and 4. Concerning their participation; As for the firſt, The Proteſtants differ from the Papiſts in this, that according to the nature of Sacraments, and the Doctrine of holy Scripture we make the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine, and they acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents only to be ſigns. In the ſecond, they not underſtanding our opinion do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent it, for we do not hold (as they ſay we do) that only the merits of the Death of Chriſt are repreſented by the bleſſed Elements, but alſo that his very Body which was crucified, and his Bloud which was ſhed for us, are truly ſignified and offered, that our Souls may receive and poſſeſs Chriſt, as truly and certainly as the material and viſible ſigns are by us ſeen and received. And ſo in the third place, becauſe the thing ſignified is offered and given to us, as truly as the ſign it ſelf, in this reſpect we own the Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Body and bloud of Chriſt, and the Elements, whoſe uſe and office we hold to be changed from what it was before. But we deny what the Papiſts affirm, that the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine are quite aboliſhed, and changed into the Body and Bloud of our Lord in ſuch ſort, that the bare accidents
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65834:29"/>
of the Elements do alone remain united with Chriſts Body and Bloud. And we alſo deny that the Elements ſtill retain the nature of Sacraments when not uſed according to divine inſtitution, that is, given by Chriſts Miniſters, and received by his People; ſo that Chriſt in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated bread ought not, cannot be kept and preſerved to be carried about, becauſe he is preſent only to the Communicants. As for the fourth and laſt point, we do not ſay, that in the Lords Supper we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive only the benefits of Chriſts Death and Paſſion, but we joyn the ground with its fruits, that is, Chriſt with thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages we receive from him, affirming with St. <hi>Paul, That the bread which we break</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 16.</note> 
               <hi>is</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the Communion of the body of Chriſt, and the Cup which we bleſs, the Communion of his bloud;</hi> of that very ſubſtance which he took of the bleſſed Virgin, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards carried into heaven; differing from thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> only in this, that they will have our Union with Chriſt to be corporal, and our eating of him likewiſe, and we on the contrary maintain it to be, indeed as true, but not carnal or natural. And as he that receives unworthily, (that is, with the mouth only, but not with a faithful heart) eats and drinks his own
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65834:30"/>
damnation, ſo he that doth it worthily, receives his Abſolution and Juſtification; that is, he that <hi>diſcerns,</hi> and then receives the Lords Body as torn, and his Bloud as ſhed for the redemption of the world. But that Chriſt (as the Papiſts affirm) ſhould give his fleſh and bloud to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with the mouth, and ground with the teeth, ſo that not only the moſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and Infidels, but even Rats and Mice ſhould ſwallow him down, this our words and our hearts do utterly deny.</p>
            <p n="6">6. So then, (to ſum up this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie by applying to it all that hath been ſaid) It is not queſtioned whether the Body of Chriſt be abſent from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment duly adminiſtred according to his Inſtitution, which we Proteſtants neither affirm nor believe: For it being given and received in the Communion, it muſt needs be that it is preſent, though in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner veiled under the Sacrament, ſo that of it ſelf it cannot be ſeen. Neither is it doubted or diſputed whether the Bread and Wine, by the power of God and a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural vertue, be ſet apart and fitted for a much nobler uſe, and raiſed to a higher dignity than their nature bears; for we confeſs the neceſſity of a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and heavenly change, and that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65834:30"/>
the ſigns cannot become Sacraments but by the infinite power of God, whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per right it is to inſtitute Sacraments in his Church, being able alone to endue them with vertue and efficacy. Finally, we do not ſay that our bleſſed Saviour gave only the figure and ſign of his body; neither do we deny a Sacramental Union of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt with the ſacred Bread and Wine, ſo that both are really and ſubſtantially received together: But (that we may avoid all ambiguity) we deny that after the words and prayer of Conſecration, the bread ſhould remain bread no longer, but ſhould be changed into the ſubſtance of the Body of Chriſt, nothing of the Bread but only the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents continuing to be what they were before: And ſo the whole queſtion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Tranſubſtantiation of the outward Elements; whether the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Bread be turned into the ſubſtance of Chriſts Body, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Wine into the ſubſtance of his Bloud; or as the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe their Tranſubſtantiation, whether the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine doth utterly periſh, and the ſubſtance of Chriſts Body and Bloud ſucceed in their place, which are both denied by Proteſtants.</p>

               <p>That neither the word nor name of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, nor the Doctrine or the thing it ſelf is taught or contained in holy Scripture, or in the Writings of the ancient Doctors of the Church, but rather is contrary to them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not of Faith.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1. THe word Tranſubſtantiation is ſo far from being found either in the ſacred Records, or in the Monuments of the ancient Fathers, that the maintainers of it do themſelves acknowledge that it was not ſo much as heard of before the twelfth Century. For though one <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Autun,</hi> be ſaid to have once uſed it, yet it is without proof that ſome Modern Writers make him one of the tenth Century; nor yet doth he ſay, that the bread is Tranſubſtantiated, <hi>but as it were</hi> Tranſubſtantiated, which <note n="*" place="margin">See ch. 1. art. 6. c. 3 art. 4. c. 4. art. 5, <hi>and this</hi> ch. art. 5.</note> well underſtood might be admitted.</p>

               <hi>though he might bring Scripture clear enough, to his thinking, to prove Tranſubſtantiation by, to an eaſie man, yet ſtill it would be doubtful whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had done it to purpoſe, becauſe ſome very acute and learned men, as</hi> Scotus, <hi>hold that it cannot be proved by Scripture.</hi> Now in this, Proteſtants deſire no more but to be of the opinion of thoſe learned and acute men.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And indeed, the words of inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would plainly make it appear to any man that would prefer truth to wrangling, that it is with the Bread, that the Lords Body is given, (as his Bloud with the Wine) for Chriſt; having taken, bleſſed, and broken the bread, ſaid, <hi>This is my body;</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> than whom none could better underſtand the meaning of Chriſt, explains it thus, <hi>The bread which we break is the</hi>

               </gap>, <hi>Communion or communication of the body of Chriſt,</hi> that whereby his body is given, and the Faithful are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of it. That it was bread which he reacht to them, there was no need of any proof, the receiver's ſenſes ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinc'd them of it; but that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65834:35"/>
his body was given, none could have known, had it not been declared by him who is the truth it ſelf. And though, by the divine inſtitution and the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apoſtle every faithful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant may be as certainly aſſured that he receives the Lords Body, as if he knew that the Bread is ſubſtantially turned into it, yet it doth not therefore follow, that the Bread is ſo changed, that its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is quite done away, ſo that there remains nothing preſent, but the very natural Body of Chriſt, made of bread: For certain it is, that the bread is not the Body of Chriſt any otherwiſe than as the Cup is the New Teſtament, and two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent conſequences cannot be drawn from thoſe two not different expreſſions. Therefore as the Cup cannot be the New Teſtament but by a Sacramental figure, no more can the Bread be the Body of Chriſt, but in the ſame ſenſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. As to what <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others ſay, That it is not poſſible the words of Chriſt can be true, but by that converſion, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> calls Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is ſo far from being ſo, that if it were admitted, it would firſt deny the Divine Omnipotency, as though God were not able to make the Body of Chriſt
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65834:36"/>
preſent, and truly to give it in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whilſt the ſubſtance of the Bread remains. 2. It would be inconſiſtent with the Divine Benediction which preſerves things in their proper being. 3. It would be contrary to the true nature of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which always conſiſteth of two parts. And laſtly, It would in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner deſtroy the true ſubſtance of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Bloud of Chriſt, which cannot be ſaid to be made of Bread and Wine by a Prieſt, without a moſt high preſumption. But the truth of the words of Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains conſtant, and can be defended, without overthrowing ſo many other great truths. Suppoſe a Teſtator puts Deeds and Titles in the hand of his Heir, with theſe words, Take the Houſe which I bequeath thee; There is no man will think that thoſe Writings and Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are that very Houſe which is made of Wood or Stones, and yet no man will ſay that the Teſtator ſpake falſly or obſcurely. Likewiſe our bleſſed Saviour, having ſanctified the Elements by his words and prayers, gave them to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples as Seals of the New Teſtament, whereby they were as certainly ſecured of thoſe rich and precious Legacies which he left to them, as Children are of their
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65834:36"/>
Fathers Lands and Inheritance, by Deeds and Inſtruments ſigned and delivered for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To the Sacred Records we may add the judgment of the Primitive Church. For thoſe Orthodox and holy Doctors of our holier Religion, thoſe great Lights of the Catholick Church, do all clearly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and unanimouſly conſpire in this, That the preſence of the Body of Chriſt in the Sacrament is only myſtick and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual. As for the entire annihilation of the ſubſtance of the Bread and the Wine, or that new and ſtrange Tenet of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, they did not ſo much as hear or ſpeak any thing of it: Nay, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſtream of their Doctrine doth clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly run againſt it, how great ſoever are the brags and pretences of the Papiſts to the contrary. And if you will hear them one by one, I ſhall bring ſome of their moſt noted paſſages only, that our labour may not be endleſs by rehearſing all that they have ſaid to our purpoſe on this ſubject.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I ſhall begin with that holy and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Doctor, <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> who is one <note place="margin">Juſt. Mart. An.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65834:37"/>
may well be underſtood out of theſe his words: <hi>After that the Biſhop hath prayed, and bleſſed, and the people ſaid Amen, thoſe whom we call Deacons or Miniſters give to every one of them that are preſent a portion of the</hi>

               <hi>Bread and Wine; and that food we call the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, for we do not receive it as ordinary Bread and Wine.</hi> They received it as bread, yet not as common bread. And a little after, <hi>By this food digeſted, our fleſh and bloud are fed, and we are taught that it is the Body and Bloud of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Therefore the ſubſtance of the Bread remains, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains corruptible food, even after the Conſecration, which can in no wiſe be ſaid of the immortal Body of Chriſt: For the fleſh of Chriſt is not turned into our fleſh, neither doth it nouriſh it, as doth that food which is Sacramentally called the Fleſh of Chriſt. But the Fleſh of Chriſt feeds our ſouls unto eternal life.</p>
            <p n="8">8. After the ſame manner, it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by that holy Martyr <hi>Irenaeus</hi> Biſhop much about the ſame time. <hi>The bread</hi>

And ſo when the Bread and the Cup are bleſſed by Gods Word, they become the Euchariſt of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, and from them our bodies receive nouriſhment and increaſe.</hi> Now that our fleſh is fed and encreaſed by the natural body of Chriſt cannot be ſaid without great impiety by themſelves that hold Tranſubſtantiation. For naturally no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing nouriſheth our bodies but what is made fleſh and bloud by the laſt digeſtion, which it would be blaſphemous to ſay of the incorruptible body of Chriſt. Yet the ſacred Elements which in ſome manner are, and are ſaid to be the body and bloud of Chriſt, yield nouriſhment and encreaſe to our bodies by their earthly nature, in ſuch ſort, that by vertue alſo of the heavenly and ſpiritual food which the faithful receive by means of the material,

The figure of the Body of Chriſt proves it to be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, for there can be no figure of a Ghoſt or a Phantaſm. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Chriſt having taken the Bread, and given it to his Diſciples made it his Body by ſaying, This is my Body, that is, the figure of my Body.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65834:38"/>
Argument is true, and contains a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Concluſion. For 1.

The Body of Chriſt is proved to be true by the figure of it, which is ſaid to be bread: For the bread is fit to repreſent that divine Body, becauſe of its nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing vertue, which in the bread is earthly, but in the body is heavenly. Laſtly, The realty of the Body is proved by that of its figure, and ſo if you deny the ſubſtance of the bread (as the Papiſts do) you thereby deſtroy the truth and realty of the Body of Chriſt in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>

               <hi>indeed before the bleſſing of the Sacrament, but when it is conſecrated it becomes the Body of Chriſt. This we are therefore to declare, how can that which is bread be alſo the body of Chriſt? By Conſecration.

If there be then ſo great a power in the word of Chriſt to make the Bread and Wine to be what they were not, how much greater is that power, which ſtill preſerves them to be what they were, and yet makes them to be what they were not?

Or did Chriſt ſay concerning the accidents of the Bread and Wine, theſe accidents

are, or this accident is my body? But (though we have not that liberty, yet) the Inventors of Tranſubſtantiation may when they pleaſe make a Creator of a Creature, ſubſtances of accidents, acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of ſubſtances, and any thing out of any thing. But ſure they are too immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and uncharitable, who, to elude the authority of ſo famous and ſo worthy a Father as <hi>Theodoret,</hi> alledge that he was accuſed of ſome errours in the Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> though he repented afterwards, as they themſelves are forced to confeſs.

And indeed, the image and reſemblance of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt is celebrated in this myſterious action. By this therefore we ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly enough, that we muſt believe that to be in Chriſt, which we believe to be in his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that, as by the perfecting vertue of the Holy Ghoſt, it becomes a divine ſubſtance, and yet remains in the propriety of its nature; ſo this great Myſtery the Incarnation, of whoſe power and efficacy this is a lively image doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate that there is one intire and true Chriſt, conſiſting of two natures, which yet properly remain unchanged. It doth plainly appear</hi> out of theſe words, that the change wrought in the Sacrament is not ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, for firſt, the ſanctified Elements are ſo made the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, that ſtill they continue to be, by

               <hi>Adoption, as the Sacrament of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, conſecrated in the Bread and Wine is ſaid to be his Body and Bloud; not that his Body be Bread, or his Bloud Wine, but becauſe the Bread and Wine are the Sacrament of his Body and Bloud, and therefore ſo called by Chriſt, when he gave them to his Diſciples. Sirmondus</hi> the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> hath writ Annotations on <hi>Facundus;</hi> but when he came to this place he had nothing to ſay, but that the Bread is no Bread, but only the likeneſs and appearance of Bread: An opinion ſo unlike that of <hi>Facundus</hi> that it ſhould not have been Fathered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, by a learned and ingenuous man, as <hi>Sirmondus</hi> would be thought to be. For he cannot ſo much as produce any one of the ancient Fathers that ever made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of accidents ſubſiſting without a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, (called by him the appearances of Bread.)

               <hi>Paſchaſius,</hi> there is nothing that favours the Tranſubſtantiation of the Bread, or its deſtruction or removal.

But he hath many things repugnant to Tranſubſtantiation, which (as I have ſaid) the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf had not yet quite found out. I ſhall mention a few of them. <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>left us this Sacrament, a viſible figure and character of his Body and Bloud, that by them our Spirit might the better embrace ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and inviſible things, and be more fully fed by Faith.</hi> Again, <hi>We muſt receive our ſpiritual Sacraments with the mouth of the Soul, and the taſte of Faith.</hi> Item. <hi>Whilſt therein we ſavour nothing carnal, but we being ſpiritual, and underſtanding the whole ſpiritually, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in Chriſt.</hi> And a little after, <hi>The fleſh and bloud of Chriſt are received ſpiritually.</hi> And again, <hi>To ſavour according to the fleſh, is death; and yet to receive ſpiritually the true Fleſh of Chriſt, is life eternal.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>The Fleſh and bloud of Chriſt are not received car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, but ſpiritually.</hi> In theſe he teacheth, that the Myſtery of the Lords Supper is
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65834:51"/>
not, and ought not to be underſtood car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally but ſpiritually, and that this dream of corporal and oral Tranſubſtantiation was unknown to the Ancient Church. As for what hath been added to this Book, by the craft (without doubt) of ſome ſuperſtitious forgerer, (as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> complains that it too frequently happens to the Writing of the Ancients,) it is Fabulous, as the viſible appearing of the Body of Chriſt in the form of an Infant with fingers of raw fleſh; ſuch ſtuff is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be Fathered on <hi>Paſchaſius,</hi> who profeſt that he delivered no other Doctrin concerning the Sacrament, than that which he had learned out of the Ancient Fathers, and not from idle and uncertain ſtories of Miracles.</p>

And though the Fathers uſed both ways of ſpeaking (that is, that the Bread and Wine are the true Body and Bloud of Chriſt, and that their ſubſtance ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, they are Signs, Types, Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances, and Pledges of them; Images, Figures, Similitudes, Repreſentations, and Samplers of them,) yet there was no cantrariety or diverſity in the ſenſe For they were not ſo Faithleſs as to believe that theſe are only naturall Elements, or bare Signs; and they were not of ſo groſs and ſo dull an apprehenſion, as not to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:65834:58"/>
diſtinguiſh betwixt the Sacramental and Myſtick, and the carnal and natural pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt, as it is now maintained by the Patrons of Tranſubſtantiation. For in this they underſtood no other change than that which is common to all Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereby the outward natural part is ſaid to be changed into the inward and divine, only becauſe it repreſents it truly and efficaciouſly, and makes all worthy Receivers partakers thereof; and becauſe by the vertue of the Holy Spirit, and of Chriſt's holy inſtitution, the Elements obtain thoſe divine Excellencies and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives, which they cannot have of their own nature. And this is it which was taught and believed, for above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years together, by pious and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Antiquity, concerning this moſt holy Myſtery.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are alſo ſome other things whereby we may underſtand that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients did not belief <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> or that the preſence of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt is ſo inſeparably tyed to the accidents of Bread and Wine, that Chriſt muſt needs be preſent as long as thoſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents retain any reſemblance of Bread and Wine, even when they are not put to that uſe appointed by divine inſtitution.

We will therefore
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65834:59"/>
briefly examine them, that it may yet more fully appear that Antiquity and all Fathers did not in the leaſt favour the new Tenet of Tranſubſtantiation; but that, that true Doctrin which I have ſet down in the begining of this book, was conſtantly own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and preſerved in the Church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Now, almoſt all that they produce out of the Fathers will be conveniently reduced to certain heads, that we may not be too tedious in anſwering each teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by it ſelf.</p>

For becauſe this is a Sacrament, the change muſt be underſtood to be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental alſo, whereby common Bread and Wine become the Sacrament of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, which could not be did not the ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine remain, for a Sacrament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of two parts, an earthly and a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly. And ſo becauſe ordinary Bread is changed by conſecration into a Bread which is no more of common uſe, but
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:65834:61"/>
appointed by divine inſtitution to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental ſign whereby is repreſented the Body of Chriſt, in whom dwelleth the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby dignified, having great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies ſuperadded, and ſo made what it was not before, it is therefore ſaid by ſome of the Fathers to be changed, to be made another thing. And truly that change is great and ſupernatural, but yet not ſubſtantial, not of a ſubſtance which ſubſtantially ceaſeth to be, into another ſubſtance which ſubſtantially beginneth to be, but it is a change of ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which alters not the natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the Element. This is alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Scripture, which uſually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes and repreſents the converſion of men, and the ſupernatural change of things, as though it were natural, though it be not ſo. So thoſe that are renewed by the Word, and Spirit, and Faith of Chriſt, are ſaid to be <note n="a" place="margin">Joh. 3. 3. 1 Pet. 1. 3. 1 Cor. 4. 15. Rom. 12. 3.

But Proteſtants who ſcorn to play the Sophiſters, interpret theſe and the like paſſages of the Fathers, with candour and ingenuity, (as it is moſt fitting they ſhould.) For the expreſſions of Preachers, which often have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a Paradox, muſt not be taken according to that harſher ſound where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they at firſt ſtrike the Auditors ears; the Fathers ſpake not of any Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated bread, but of the myſtical and conſecrated, when they uſed thoſe ſorts of expreſſions; and that for theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: 1. That they might extoll and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie the dignity of this Myſtery, which all true Chriſtians acknowledge to be
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:65834:64"/>
very great and peerleſs. 2. That Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants might not reſt in the outward Elements, but ſeriouſly conſider the thing repreſented, whereof they are moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly made partakers, if they be worthy Receivers. 3. And laſtly, That they might approach ſo great a Myſtery with the more zeal, reverence, and devotion. And that thoſe Hyperbolick expreſſions are thus to be underſtood, the Fathers themſelves teach clearly enough, when they come to interpret them.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Laſtly, Being the ſame holy Fathers who (as the manner is to diſcourſe of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments) ſpeak ſometimes of the Bread and Wine in the Lords Supper, as if they were the very Body and Bloud of Chriſt, do alſo very often call them Types, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Signs, the Figure of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt; from hence it appears moſt manifeſtly that they were of the Proteſtants, and not of the Papiſts opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. For we can without prejudice to what we believe of the Sacraments, uſe thoſe former expreſſions which the Papiſts believe, do moſt favour them, if they be underſtood, as they ought to be, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally. But the latter none can uſe, but he muſt thereby overthrow the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation; theſe
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65834:64"/>
two, the Bread is Tranſubſtantiated into the Body, and the Bread alſo is the Type, the Sign, the Figure of the body of Chriſt being wholly inconſiſtent. For it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that a thing that loſeth its being ſhould yet be the ſign and repreſentation of another; neither can any thing be the Type and the Sign of it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="10">10. But if without admitting of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental ſenſe the words be uſed too rigorouſly, nothing but this will follow, that the Bread and Wine are really and properly the very Body and Bloud of Chriſt, which they themſelves diſown, that hold Tranſubſtantiation. Therefore in this change, it is not a newneſs of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but of uſe and vertue that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; which yet the Fathers acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged with us, to be wonderful, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, and proper only to Gods Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency: For that earthly and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible meat cannot become to us a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and heavenly, the Communion of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, without Gods eſpecial power and operation. And whereas it is far above Philoſophy and Humane Reaſon, that Chriſt from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (where alone he is locally) ſhould reach down to us the divine vertue of his Fleſh, ſo that we are made one body with
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:65834:65"/>
him; therefore it is as neceſſary as it is reaſonable, that the Fathers ſhould tell us, that we ought with ſingleneſs of heart to believe the Son of God, when he ſaith, <hi>This is my body;</hi> and that we ought not to meaſure this high and holy Myſtery by our narrow conceptions, or by the courſe of nature. For it is more acceptable to God with an humble ſimplicity of faith to reverence and embrace the words of Chriſt, than to wreſt them violently to a ſtrange and improper ſenſe, and with curioſity and preſumption to determine what exceeds the capacity of Men and Angels. Thus much in general may ſuffice to anſwer thoſe places of the Fathers, which are uſually brought in the behalf of Tranſubſtantiation.

Therefore let us with all cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty receive the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, for
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:65834:66"/>
his Body under the appearance of the Bread, and his Bloud under the appearance of the Wine are given to thee.</hi> Indeed Proteſtants do <note place="margin">Senſu jam ſaepius dicto.</note> freely grant, and firmly believe, that the Wine (as hath often been ſaid) is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the Bloud of Chriſt, but every change is not a Tranſubſtantiation; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth <hi>Cyril</hi> ſay that this change is like that of the water, for then it would alſo appear to our ſenſes; but that he who changed the Water ſenſibly, can alſo change the Wine Sacramentally, will not be doubted by any. As for what he calls the Appearances of Bread and Wine, he doth not thereby exclude, but rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude their ſubſtance, and mean the Bread and Wine it ſelf: For ſo he intimates by what there follows; <hi>Do not look on them as bare Bread and Wine;</hi> as much as to ſay, it is bread indeed, but yet not bare bread, but ſomething beſides. But that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Water into Wine makes nothing for Tranſubſtantiation, may be thus made to appear. That Gods Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency can change one ſubſtance into another, none will deny, and we ſee it done by Chriſt in the Town of <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> when he changed the Water into Wine; and it was a true and proper Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation. But the Papiſts in the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65834:67"/>
Lords Supper tell us of quite another change, which, if well conſidered, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo much as be underſtood. For the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Bread is not changed into another that had no being, but, as they ſay, the bread is changed into that body of Chriſt which really exiſted and had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe many hundred years, ever ſince the Incarnation: Whereas that very Wine which Chriſt made of the Water, was not in being before the change which he wrought. Now it is eaſie for any to underſtand, that he who created all things out of nothing, can well make a new Wine of Water, or any other thing; but it is more than abſurd, that the body of Chriſt, or any other ſubſtance already in being, perfect and complete, ſhould be made afreſh of another ſubſtance, when it really ſubſiſted before. Which they well underſtood who deviſed an adduction, or bringing of the Body of Chriſt into the place of the Bread, and that is as much as to deny Tranſubſtantiation; except it can be ſaid that a man is Tranſubſtantiated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another, as often as he comes into his place, which no man in his right wits can fancy.</p>

He adds, <hi>That Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which thou receiveſt is made by the word of Chriſt; and if the word of</hi> Elias <hi>had ſo much power as to bring down fire from heaven, ſhall not the words of Chriſt be efficacious enough to change the properties of the Elements?

Many things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are done for their own ſake, and many in reference to ſomething elſe, and then they are called Signs. A Ring is given abſolutely as a gift, and then it hath no other meaning; it is alſo given to make good an Inveſtiture or Contract, and then it is a Sign: So that he that receives it may ſay, The Ring is not worth much, it is what it ſignifies, the Inheritance I value. In this manner when the Paſſion of our Lord drew nigh, he took care that his Diſciples might be inveſted with his grace, that his inviſible grace might be aſſured and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them by a viſible ſign. To this end all Sacraments are inſtituted, and to this the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the Euchariſt is appointed.</hi> Now, as no man can fancy that the Ring is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially changed into the Inheritance, whether Lands or Houſes, none alſo can ſay with truth, or without abſurdity, that the Bread and Wine are ſubſtantially changed into the Body and Bloud of Chriſt.
