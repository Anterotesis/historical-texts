         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Sunne, ſo great and ſweet, as a married eſtate
affords: what is equall to marriage for the
being and well being of life; its the prop of
mutuall content, the aide of nature, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of health, wealth, beautie, honour;
no condition is ſweet, where marriage ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes
it not; it's the pillar of the world, the
preſerver of chaſtity, the glory of peace, and
the life of the dead; no union ſo ſtrong as this,
no joy in any outward union ſo contentfull

                     <p>They provide ill for their own comforts,

                  <p>3. Labour to know the conveniences and
inconveniences which attend a married life;
Conſider if yee be able and willing to drinke
of the bitter cup of diſcontents, which the
married oft drinke off: what cares and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
attend that ſtate.</p>
                  <p>4. If upon the uſe of means for ſome ſpace
you finde your heart inclined to marry, feare
nothing, caſt thy care upon God, be as wiſe
as thou canſt, and venture upon a wife or
husband in the way of the Goſpel; then</p>
                  <p>1. Pray to God to give thee a wiſe (or
husband) that may be a meet helpe to thee;
a vertuous wife is the crown of her husband:
Crowns are rare and honourable; every one
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:152344:59"/>

thy ſide for ever after.</p>
                  <p>3. If thou art one of the Lords, marry in
the Lord, love ſuch as God loveth: that which
is deſireable in a man, is his goodneſſe, <hi>Pro.</hi>
19. 22. ſo 'tis in a woman: men ſeek wealth
and beauty without Religion, but theſe things
cannot ſupply the want of Religion; exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

faileth.</p>
                  <p>4. Chooſe one ſutable in Religion, how can
there be amity and love, where divers Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

and diſhonourable. Thirdly, Chooſe one of

few odious qualities will in time weare off
much doating delight. Fourthly, Sutable in
reſpect of condition of life, and ability of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:152344:59"/>

for ſuch as can beare it in reſpect of their

                  <p>5. Take heed leaſt yee wrong not any in
not performing your promiſe; alſo have a
care of your carriage, that yee expreſſe not
your ſelfe in ſuch a way as ſhall juſtly cauſe it
to be interpreted love, in that kinde a man
may make ſuch a profeſſion of love, and yet ſo
expreſſe himſelfe, as he ſhall not be ingaged
by promiſe (when by his practice he is) and
ſo at pleaſure depart, to the great wrong and

not fret nor cavill at them, but cover them
with tenderneſſe; if yee have a bad bargaine,
make the beſt of it you can, it's too late now
to complain, an eying each others infirmities,
deads and kills the affection of love.</p>
                     <p>5. Impart not your diſcontents to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
nor aske any counſell of them, but with
a free conſent of both, and that when an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
neceſſitie requires it. Such as complain
to others, ſhew their clamorous and turbulent
ſpirits, and want of wiſdome of love.</p>
                     <p>6. If thy husbands and wives vertues be
but ſmall, multiply them by contemplation,
and by putting upon them the great value of
their worth.</p>
                     <p>7. Obſerve each others tempers, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
diſcontents, and to preſerve and increaſe

                     <p>8. If there fall out a difference between

may decide it, and ſubmit to it.</p>
                     <p>9. Feare breaches, know a ſmall ſparke of

timely prevented; expect trouble, and beare

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:152344:61"/>

                     <p>2. Honour your husband inwardly in your

                     <p>The Lord knew that both man and wife
would have their wils, though they were quite
contrary to each other, therefore the Lord
thought fit to order it as he would have it,
that the wife ſhould yeeld to her husband,

thus ſaith the Lord; <hi>Wives ſubmit your ſelves
unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord, for
the husband is the head of the wife, even as

Chriſt is the head of his Church; therefore as
the Church is ſubject to Chriſt, ſo let the wives
be unto their own husbands in every thing,</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.
5. 22, 23, 24. Therefore, O woman,
whoſoever thou art, rich or poore, that God
hath commanded you to be ſubject to your
husband, and if you doe it not, God will call
you to an account for it one day, though it
may be your husband is content to let it paſs;
therefore in the feare of God, conſider it, and
tremble at the thought of living in the breach
of ſuch an expreſſe and plaine command;
conſider, Chriſt <hi>is the Author of ſalvation to
all that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5. 9. it may be;
you count it folly and baſeneſſe to be ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to your husband in every thing, but you
will thinke otherwiſe at the great day, when
Chriſt ſhall come in flaming fire, to render
vengeance on them that have not obey'd him,

humilitie and ſelfe deniall, to ſtoop to your

hath commanded it, and will have it ſo.</p>
                     <p>Though marriage be an equall ſtate, yet
the carriage of both is not to be the ſame,
therefore let thy love to thy husband be with
a loyall, ſweet ſubjection, without ſlavoury,
and thy obedience ſhall be a bleſſing to thee,
and an increaſe of thy inward peace, and joy;
alſo thou ſhalt avoyde many quarrels, envie,

                     <p>1. Conſider the command of God is upon
you, that you love your own wife, and be not
bitter unto her: Let love deſcend firſt from
thee, ſhee is a deſerving object of love; ſhee
hath forſaken all for thee, and perhaps is
ſhiftleſſe without thee; great are her burdens
and paines in conception and bearing chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
&amp;c. all calls for compaſſion, love, and
tenderneſſe: Let thy love be to her, full and
free; love her in ſome ſenſe better then thy
ſelfe: <hi>Husbands love your wives, even as
Chriſt alſo loved his Church, and gave himſelfe
for it; ſo ought men to love their wives as their
own bodies; he that loveth his wife, loveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe;
for no man ever yet hated his own fleſh,
they two are one fleſh,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 25. 28, 29.
31.</p>
                     <p>2. Eaſe thy wiſe as much as thou canſt;
though ſhe be bound to obey thy commands,
thou art not bound to command her: alſo
you need not command ſo many things, nor
ſo frequently, and ſo the burden of ſubjection
will be made much eaſier unto her. I conceive
it would be much better, and very commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:152344:62"/>
for the husband, to turne what he may
command, into intreaties, or ſay, wife if you
pleaſe, doe ſuch a thing; ſo would it be no
burden to her, it being wholy removed, and
more would be done by her, and that with
eaſe and delight. Surely for a husband to
command all he may, he will be bitter to her,
and if ſhee ſhould obey, as ſhee ought, may it
not prove very burdenſome; if ſhee be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to obey, ſpare her; if unwilling, forbeare
her, that ſo ſhee may ſin leſſe: Say not, thou

alſo, it's but equall, ſhee ſhall be ſure to ſhare

have much, and ſpend much upon their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,

upon. Conſider</p>
                     <p>1. Many in ſtead of living upon God, live
upon a deceived heart, <hi>Pro.</hi> 3. 5, 6, 7.</p>
                     <p>2. Many live upon ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>3. Many live upon corrupt reaſon.</p>
                     <p>4. Some build their hopes of ſalvation
upon other mens judgements.</p>
                     <p>5. Many live upon the report of others;
it appeares by this, if men ſpeake not well of
them, they are greatly troubled, and not able
to beare it; by which it appeares, their life
is in it: the reaſon <hi>Laban</hi> made ſuch a ſtirre
for his images, was becauſe they were his gods.</p>
                     <p>6. Many live upon their reformation, they
thanke God, they are not ſo bad as they have
been, therefore they hope now all is well;
it's well when men grow better; yet abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
from evill, is no evidence of grace, for
men may forbeare the act of ſin, for feare of
hell, or men.</p>
                     <p>7. Many live upon duties, and as they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,
their hope and confidence increaſeth,
but when their duties faile them, their hope
and confidence is at an end; by which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares,
they live upon what they doe, and
not upon God; theſe count their duties, which
is their righteouſneſſe, gaine, but if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to God, they muſt count againe, as <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <pb n="128" facs="tcp:152344:69"/>
did this their gaine to be <hi>loſſe for Chriſt,</hi> Phil.
3. 8.</p>
                     <p>8. Some live upon their peace, they are
quiet, free from terrors and feare of hell in
them, therefore they conclude, they are in a
good eſtate, this is a ſubtill deluſion.</p>
                     <p>9. Many live upon groundleſſe hopes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their ſinnes are few, or ſmall, as they
thinke, they have hope.</p>
                     <p>10. Many live upon their inward comfort
and joy, that while that laſts, they have much
aſſurance of ſalvation, but as ſoone as their
comfort and joy, which they ſenſibly felt,
leaves them, their confidence went with their
comfort, and leaves them in a ſad condition.</p>
                     <p>11. Some live upon raviſhments, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies
of glory.</p>
                     <p>12. Many live upon the ordinances of men,
are ready to be of any Religion the authority
will impoſe, and ſo reſt ſatisfied.</p>
                     <p>13. Many live upon the ordinances of God
without God, they reſt ſatisfied, that they
frequent the ordinances.</p>
                     <p>14. Some live upon their confidence of
ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>15. Many live upon creature comforts,
and conclude, God loves them, becauſe they
poſſeſſe them.</p>
                     <p>16. Many live upon the Devill, and his
word, which is when Satans ſuggeſtions are
hearkened unto, liked, beleeved, imbraced,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:152344:69"/>
and obeyed: if he ſay, their ſinnes ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be pardoned and ſubdued, they beleeve
him, and are ruled by him; this is ſo to live
upon the Devill, as to hearken unto God, as
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 3. to <hi>beleeve in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 23. and
to <hi>ſubmit to God,</hi> James 4. 7. is to live upon

                     <p>4. If they be not Gods word and will, we

as it condemnes the wiſdome of man to
be fooliſhneſſe, in that it cannot underſtand it,
and ſeing they cannot know it, they could not

moſt excellent in nature, therefore the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of nature was not the Author of the

the whole ſcope and drift of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
tend wholy to deſtroy that which the
nature of man loveth moſt, as the way and will
of man, yea it requires him to deny himſelfe;
what is more contrary to nature then this;
therefore this never came from the nature of
man; beſides, it is a ſtrong argument, that the
Scriptures came not originally from man, but
from God, becauſe they are no whit agreeable
to our natures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hence it is worth obſerving,
that we naturally chooſe and delight to reade
any Booke rather then the Scriptures; as we
ſee by experience, that thoſe that read much,
reade little in the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>4. Becauſe the Scriptures require that
which is beyond the power of man to doe,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:152344:73"/>
as that he ſhould deny himſelfe, which to doe
requires a divine power, as the Scriptures and
experience teach; ſelfe is for it ſelfe, how
then can ſelfe deny it ſelfe; nature doth not
require, nor deſire any ſuch thing, therefore
it's required by ſome other, which muſt needs
be God; alſo it affirmes that which is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to the reaſon, nature, and wiſdome of
man, as that a Virgin ſhould conceive a Son,
this is beyond the reach of nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is from God.</p>
                     <p>5. The Scriptures are not from men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the more any are ruled by it, and obey
it, the more they are hated and perſecuted by
men; which ſhewes it was never the will of
man, and therefore it came not from nature,
but from God.</p>
                     <p>6. The Scriptures came from God, becauſe
they tend to God, this is a rule in nature, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing tends to it's center; a ſtone to the
earth, the waters to the Sea from whence they
came; So the Scriptures tend to God, they
run to God, they ſhew God in his goodneſſe,
wiſdome, power, love; in the Scriptures there
is a divine wiſdome, they ſpeak for God, they
call men to God, and to be for God, which is
the center of the Scriptures.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>8. The Scriptures are from God, becauſe
God hath wonderfully &amp; ſtrangely preſerved
them, in making the <hi>Jewes,</hi> who were enemies
to Chriſt, and his words, preſervers of the
Scriptures: alſo in preſerving them, when the
greateſt men have ſought their deſtruction, by
ſearching for them, and burning them, &amp;c.
The like preſervation cannot be declared of
any other writings that have had ſo great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
                     <p>9. The miracles which were wrought at the
firſt publiſhing of the Scriptures, prove them
to be from God; and that there were ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
wee have the teſtimony of thoſe who
were enemies to Chriſt, and the Scriptures,
thoſe <hi>Jewes</hi> who did not own Chriſt, nor his
doctrine, who lived in Chriſts time; ſaying,
<hi>There was a man one Jeſus</hi> (if I may call him
a man) <hi>who did great miracles,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>Joſephus</hi>
&amp; others in their writings teſtifie. Now what
reaſon can be given, that the enemies to
Chriſt, and his doctrine, ſhould confeſſe ſuch
things of Chriſt, if they were not true?</p>
                     <p>10. Laſtly, We know the Scriptures to be
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:152344:74"/>
from God, becauſe we ſee in our dayes ſome
of thoſe things the Scriptures have foretold,
come to paſſe; which things came not to paſſe
in the courſe of nature, nor in the eye of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
as <hi>Mat. 24. 5. 24. Luk. 12. 52, 53. 1 Tim.</hi>
4. 1. &amp;c. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. To beleeve the Scriptures
are of divine inſpiration, is a work of faith,
and unleſſe the holy Spirit perſwade the ſoule
of the truth of them, there will be doubting;
the Lord perſwade his of the truth of them,
and of their intereſt in them.</p>
                     <p>Seeing the Scriptures came from God by
divine inſpiration, they muſt needs be truth,
therefore we ought to beleeve what it ſaith,
and reſt upon it, whether there be reaſon to
ſatisfie reaſon or no, our reaſon is blinde and
corrupt.</p>
                     <p>2. Seeing they are the inſpirations of God,
it ſhould cauſe us to prize and love the Word
of the Lord; <hi>David</hi> did ſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 97. he
loved it vehemently, exceedingly, unſpeakea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly:
the Saints love the Word, and they are
not aſhamed to declare their love to it; they
love it for the excellency that is in it; they ſee
love, wiſdome, truth, purity, &amp;c. <hi>The Word is
very pure, therefore thy ſervants love it,</hi> Pſal.
119. 105, 151. It's <hi>a light to our feete;</hi> the rule
of our life; it tends to perfection; it cures all
diſtempers; it's the ground of our confidence;
it keeps us <hi>from periſhing in affliction,</hi> 92. It
<hi>quickeneth us, 93. It rejoyceth the heart,</hi> 111.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:152344:75"/>
It's lovely, and ſuch as love the Lord, love his
word, <hi>Job</hi> 23. 12. Love to the Word, is a holy
and ſtrong inclination of ſoule, or affection
of heart, ariſing from the apprehenſion of the
Author of it, and the excellency and ſutable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of it, which cauſeth the ſoule to deſire &amp;
priſe it above all things, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 17. 25. If yee
love the word, then yee will highly eſteeme it
<hi>above gold,</hi> above <hi>fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

gold and ſilver,</hi> Pſal. 119. 72. Secondly, then
you deſire it, love works by deſire, great love
is attended with great deſire, and longing to
injoy it. Thirdly, then you will take paines to
injoy it, and obey it; love and labour goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 4. Fourthly, then you thinke
often upon it, for ſo wee doe what wee love,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. Fiftly, then it ſhall rule you; <hi>I have
refrained from every evill way, that I might
keepe thy word,</hi> Pſal. 119. 101. To obey it is a
fruit of love; ſo contrary, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81. 11. Sixthly,
then it's a griefe to you that others contemne
&amp; reject the word; <hi>I was grieved, becauſe men
kept not thy word,</hi> Pſal. 119. 158. <hi>Rivers of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
run downe mine eyes, becauſe men keepe not
thy law,</hi> 135. ſee 139. <hi>v.</hi> Seventhly, then you
hate every thing that is contrary to the word,
love works by deteſtation of that which is
contrary to that they love; <hi>I hate every falſe
way,</hi> Pſal. 119. 104. Eightly, then you <hi>rejoyce
in the Word, as one that findeth great ſpoyle,</hi>
Pſal. 119. 162. Ninthly, then you will reſt on
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:152344:75"/>
what the Word ſaith; <hi>I truſt in thy Word,</hi> 42.
Tenthly, then you will part with your ſweet
ſin for the Word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14.
We have cauſe to be aſhamed for our want
of love to the Word; our ſeldome meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on it, might convince us of our want here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:
To love the word, 1. Pray that thou maiſt
ſee the beauty and excellency of the Word.
2. Reade and meditate on it. 3. Practiſe it, and
you ſhall better know it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 17. 4. Abate in
carnall affections, for they are enemies to holy
love. 5. Conſider the Word deſerves thy love.
6. Conſider it's thine, and thoſe good things
contained in it: the more we beleeve the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in the word, the more we love it; <hi>Great
peace have they that love thy law, and nothing
ſhall offend them,</hi> Pſal. 119. 169.</p>
                     <p>3. Seeing they are the inſpirations of God,
it ſhould cauſe us to cleave to the Scriptures,
heare nothing againſt it; prove all things by
the Scriptures; it will be a ſpeciall means a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
errors and hereſies; Chriſt made uſe of
the Scriptures, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 17. to 22. and directed
others to doe ſo, <hi>Joh. 5. 39. Search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
for in them yee thinke to have eternall life,
for they teſtifie of me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some deny that Jeſus Chriſt is God.</p>
                     <p>The Scriptures prove that Chriſt is God.</p>

God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 20. The Word was God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1. 14.
Chriſt who is God over all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 5. Unto the

and ever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 8.</p>
                     <p>That the holy Spirit is God, the Scriptures
declare: the Spirit is eternall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
                     <p>1. Becauſe <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> therefore the

1 Cor. 9. 19. Luk. 1. 67. 1 Cor. 6. 19.</p>
                     <p>5. To lie to God, and to lie to the Spirit,

Chriſt, and the Spirit; and ſo ſhould deceive
many. Wee are forewarned and commanded
to <hi>hold the forme of ſound words;</hi> and ſeeing
the <hi>Scriptures are able to make the man of God
perfect, and to furniſh him for every good work,</hi>
2 Tim. 3. We neither may, nor need preſume

And ſo for other things, bring them to the
Scriptures to be tryed, and beleeve nothing
but what God faith in his Word, and expect
not to ſatisfie Reaſon in matters of Religion:
We beleeve God is without beginning, and
preſent in every place, who knoweth and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
all things: but what reaſon can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
that God is ſo, is it not beyond the reach
of reaſon, to underſtand that any thing can
be, that never had a beginning? God is ſo, elſe
he could not be God; <hi>Behold, God is great,
and we know him not, neither can the number
of his yeares be ſearched out,</hi> Job 36. 26. <hi>Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Almighty wee cannot finde him out</hi>

                     <p>So alſo concerning the Baptiſme of Infants,
bring it to the Scriptures, and try it by them,
ſee if yee can finde either a command or an
example there for it; wee finde none, if wee
admit of one invention in Religion, by the
ſame reaſon we muſt admit of many, yea any
invention of men: God complaineth of the
doing of that which he commanded them not,

                  <p>To leave their firſt love, is to abate in the

                  <p>Gods own people are ſubject to decline, or
leave their firſt love; this the Scripture and
experience teſtifie.</p>
                  <p>The cauſes of our proneneſſe to decline in
our love to God are many.</p>
                  <p>1. Our natures are prone to it, we have an

conſider it not, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>2. Security in us, cauſeth us to thinke wee
are well, and need not feare no danger, and
ſo we fall before we are aware.</p>
                  <p>3. Is from the inſenſibleneſſe of this ſin,
it ſecretly ſteales upon us, wee fall ſo eaſily,
and by ſmall degrees, that we perceive it not

                  </p>

love of God, and reſt ſatisfied in it, cauſeth us
to ſeeke ſatisfaction elſewhere, and reſting ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
in that we are happy, and what affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
&amp; actions we formerly have had for God,
thinke wee have done enough: this is a baſe

what is behinde, and preſſe forward,</hi> as
knowing they can never doe enough for him,

                  <p>9. Becauſe iniquity abounds, the love of many

                  <p>God will have his to know that it is a great

                  <p>The greatneſſe of this ſin appeares in theſe
particulars.</p>
                  <p>1. Becauſe our love is Gods, and he calls
for it; <hi>My ſonne, give me thy heart;</hi> He calls
for his own, and it's unreaſonable to deny
him his own.</p>
                  <p>2. Love is the beſt thing we have, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ſhould give it to God, who is the
chiefeſt and beſt good, therfore he hath right
to the higheſt pitch of our love; and it's pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
ſo ſweet an affection as love is, ſhould be
ſpent upon any thing but himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>3. Love will be fixed upon ſomewhat, and
it's unreaſonable to deny it to God, and give
it to the creature; this were to <hi>forſake a living

Fallen perſons may recover, for God uſeth
meanes to recover ſuch; this his love ſhould
worke upon us; one great cauſe we doe not
our dutie is, becauſe we doe not minde it,
our declinings might eaſily be diſcerned by
us, if we did but minde it.</p>
                  <p>The conſideration and <hi>remembrance</hi> of what

                  <p>2. See if you cannot remember that time
was when you tooke more ſweet joy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,

fallen, and your affections are divided.</p>
                  <p>3. If you can remember the time was when
you had more faith and confidence in God
then now you have, then you are fallen; for
a decay in faith, and a decay in love, ever goe
together; the leſſe faith, the leſſe love, ſo
much unbeliefe, ſo much want of love.</p>
                  <p>4. If there was a time, in which you were
more willing to doe and ſuffer for God, and
to dye to goe home to him, then you have
left your firſt love.</p>

thou art fallen <hi>from thy firſt love.</hi> Some may
ſay, once I prayed with more faith and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency,

                  <p>6. Have you as much zeale for God and
his truth now as ever? the communion of
Saints once more deſired, loved, and deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

from your firſt love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. If ever you did love the things of the
world leſſe then you doe now? then you are
fallen; for love to the world cauſeth a decay
in our love to God: love not the world: ſo
much as we love the world, ſo much we come
ſhort in our love to God.</p>
                  <p>8. Can you not ſay, time was when I was
more affected with the love of God, and did
more minde him, and his love? then you are
fallen; for ſo much as we forget Gods love to
us, ſo much we forget to love him; the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
his love, begets love in us to him;
<hi>We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> When
Gods love in ſaving us, did appeare to us to
be great and wonderfull, it ſet out hearts afire
with love to him, to live and dye with him,
and for him, and becauſe we minde his love
leſſe, therefore we love him leſſe.</p>

If we ſhould compare our ſelves with theſe

you are fallen from your firſt love, oh lay it to

                     <hi>And repent:</hi> the Lord bids thee repent:
what repentance is, ſee <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 18, 19.</p>
                  <p>The leaſt declining in our love to God, is
cauſe enough of <hi>repentance:</hi> it's to be laid to
heart; Repentance is a duty ſutable for a
Saint that hath aſſurance of the love of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And doe thy firſt workes: Doe,</hi> ſaith God,
the life of a Saint is a life of action; to live to
God, and for God, is no idle life, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
many things to be done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doe thy firſt workes:</hi> Repentance without
reformation is not ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>Such as leave their firſt love, leave their firſt
workes; as we decay in our love to God, ſo we
decay in our obedience to him.</p>
                  <p>As our love is to Chriſt, ſo according is our
fruitfulneſſe; cold love is attended with bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſſe.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>doe our firſt workes,</hi> is a ſpeciall means
to recover our firſt love.</p>
                  <p>Meanes to recover our firſt love.</p>
                  <p>1. Frequent thoſe duties, meditation and
prayer, &amp;c. in which you injoyed communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with God, in which God conveyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:152344:88"/>
to thee; God may by thoſe meanes fill
thee with himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>2. Beleeve God will raiſe thee up, it's his
promiſe, <hi>Hoſ. 14. I will heale their backſlid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;</hi>
want of depending upon God, is a cauſe
of our declining; therefore faith is a meanes
to raiſe us when fallen.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Pray continually</hi> to God to raiſe thee,
and to hold thee up; <hi>hold up my going, that
my footſteps ſlide not;</hi> we are to uſe the means,
but without the preſence and bleſſing of God
all is to no purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>4. Love not the world, nor the things of
the world; wee cannot minde things above,
and things below, he that minds the things
below, cannot minde the things above; he
that is filled with theſe things below, is emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of things above, he cannot live above with
God, he that is buried in the creature, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſet his affections on things above.</p>
                  <p>5. Meditate often upon Chriſts love to
thee; what he hath given thee, and done for
thee; the conſideration thereof is enough to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> This reprooves thoſe that doe not
their firſt works, and yet thinke to recover
their firſt love, yet ſit ſtill; God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
meanes for his peoples proſperitie and
welfare, and they are to uſe them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Or elſe I will come;</hi> God will not ſuffer his
to continue long in their fallen eſtate.</p>

                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:152344:89"/>
Gods <hi>coming</hi> to his is to reforme them, and
doe them good.</p>
                  <p>Come quickly.</p>
                  <p>1. Such as are fallen from their firſt love,
are willing and prone to continue ſo.</p>
                  <p>2. The time of our repentance and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
is not left to us, God will not ſtay our
pleaſures.</p>
                  <p>3. As ſoone as we are convinced of a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to be done, we are preſently to practiſe it;
after admonition, God requires a preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;
he expects we ſhould regard his
word, and be ruled by it.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Thoſe that leave their firſt love;</hi> God
will allow but a little time and ſpace to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
in.</p>
                  <p>This ſhould exhort all that are fallen, to
riſe now quickly, put it not off to another
ſeaſon, there is no reaſon why we ſhould put
it off; becauſe</p>
                  <p>1. Gods command is now, quickly; <hi>To day
if yee will heare his voice, harden not your
hearts.</hi> To put it off will but more harden
your hearts.</p>
                  <p>2. For that which is put off till hereafter,
is oft-times never done: <hi>Felix was almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded</hi>
by <hi>Paul,</hi> but he <hi>put him off to another
ſeaſon;</hi> but when did his ſeaſon come?</p>
                  <p>3. It's eaſier riſing now then hereafter;
riſe now whileſt it is in your heart to riſe;
now God calls, therefore riſe now, now while
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:152344:89"/>
your conſcience is awake, and tell yee, yee are
fallen; the longer yee lay, the longer yee
may; for your heart will <hi>be</hi> more <hi>hardened
through the deceit fulneſſe of ſin;</hi> then yee will
have leſſe minde to riſe, and be leſſe able <hi>to
doe your firſt workes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. You have declined enough, and laine
long enough, therefore doe not deſerre it no
longer, ſeeing Chriſt calls, ſaying, <hi>Riſe my love,
my faire one, &amp; come away,</hi> Song 2. 10. Oh, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
riſe, riſe, and goe quickly to him, thirſt
after him, cry to him now inwardly and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
to raiſe you, and draw out your heart
abundantly to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> Reproofe to ſuch as know they are

not; nor uſe not any meanes to get up, but
put it off till hereafter: Oh that you would
now conſider, that in ſo doing yee diſobey the
voice of the Lord; and if you riſe not quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he will <hi>remove the Candleſticke out of it's
place.</hi> Obſerve, he ſaith not, if they doe not
ſo he will damme them, but <hi>remove the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticke.
The Candleſticke</hi> is his Church, which
is called <hi>a Candleſticke,</hi> Rev. 1. 20. A Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
holds forth the light, ſo doth the Church
of Chriſt, the light of truth, the light of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To remove the Candleſticke,</hi> is to remove one
ſocket from another, to take it a pieces; as
the Candleſtickes in the Temple had many
ſockets, ſo the Church conſiſts of many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:152344:90"/>
ſo that to remove the <hi>Candleſticke out of
it's place,</hi> is to divide and ſcatter the Church,
the members one from another: ſo he hath
done to the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> where there is
not any appearance of any of the 7 Churches
to be found.</p>
                  <p>Wee learne that a Church of Chriſt may
ceaſe to be ſo, and which is more, a Church of
Chriſt may ceaſe to be, although not guiltie
of any ſcandalous ſin, nor error in doctrine;
God chargeth them not with any ſuch evills
but onely for decaying or leaving their firſt
love.</p>
                  <p>So that if a Church of Chriſt decay in their
love to him, he will <hi>quickly</hi> un-church them,
<hi>except they repent, and doe their firſt workes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God will have his to know it is no ſmall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
to be un-churched, and ſuch as priſe
the injoyment of the Saints, with the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of God, count it an affliction to be
ſtripped of them: and becauſe God threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to un-church then, <hi>unleſſe they repent,</hi> &amp;c.
it appeares, that although they were fallen
from their firſt love, yet they had ſo much
love to Gods ordinances, and communion of
Saints, that before they would be ſtripped of
them, they would repent, and <hi>doe their firſt
workes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Except thou repent:</hi> Repentance is a means
to eſcape affliction.</p>
                  <p>If we repent not, he will ſtrip us of that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:152344:90"/>
which is neere to us, that ſo we may repent,
and be reformed.</p>
                  <p>When love will not reforme us, a rod muſt,
and it is a mercy to be reformed by any

9. 16. <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will,</hi> 18. To
aſcribe converſion to the freedome of mans
will, is to exempt the creature from being
under the power of God; for if he be able
to convert himſelfe, or to refuſe, ſo as not to
be converted; then conveſion is under his
own power. If it depend upon the will of the
creature, then the will of man is the cauſe
why God willeth this or that; this were to
bring the will of God under the will of man;
as if God ſhould ſay, I will convert that man
if he will, I have willed nothing, or my will is
mutable, my will ſhall waite on your will, and
change as oft as yours ſhall; if the will of God
ſhould not determine all things, the will of
God ſhould not be the firſt cauſe; if there be
two firſt cauſes, then there are two beginnings
or more, and ſo more Gods then one.</p>
                     <p>If God gives power, and leaves it to mans
will, then God hath not determined what ſhal
be done, or elſe his purpoſe is changeable.</p>
                     <p>If the cauſe why God chooſeth me (and not
another) is becauſe I will, then it is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

not the cauſe, you deny the freedom of Gods
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:152344:101"/>
will, and make the will of man the cauſe of
his being ſaved. If God by his omnipotent
power, inclines the wills of men, whether he
will (as is above proved) then he hath them
more in his power then man hath; if ſo, his
decreeing is the cauſe, neceſſity followes: the
will of the creature is not the cauſe of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity

a mutuall agreement of two parties to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
each of them the things agreed upon;
for it cannot be a Covenant, unleſſe there be
ſomething to be done on both parties; and
therefore a promiſe differs from a Covenant,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:152344:118"/>
in that a promiſe may tie one partie onely,
as all free and abſolute promiſes doe; but a
conditionall promiſe differs nothing from the
nature of a Covenant.</p>
                     <p>For the ſecond, it is Gods Covenant, as
appeares by theſe words; <hi>My Covenant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the third; the nature and ſubſtance of
this Covenant, its ſpirituall, and containes
principall things, ſpirituall, ſalvation, eternall
life, happineſſe, and glory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For the fourth; this Covenant is made
with Jeſus Chriſt; which appeares by theſe
words;</hi> My covenant ſhall ſtand faſt with him:
I have made a covenant with my choſen; I have
ſworne unto David my ſervant, thy ſeed will I
eſtabliſh for ever, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. I have found David
my ſervant, with my holy Oile I have anointed
him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. With whom my hand ſhall be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
my arme alſo ſhall ſtrengthen him, <hi>ver</hi> 21.</p>
                     <p>The condition on Chriſts part is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in theſe words; that he ſhould be
made <hi>a ſacrifice for ſinne:</hi> the condition on
Gods part was, that then <hi>Chriſt ſhould ſee his
ſeed, and prolong his dayes, and the pleaſure of
the Lord ſhould proſper in his hand,</hi> Iſa. 53. 10,
11, 12.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obſ:</hi> The ſumme is, that the Covenant of
grace, life, and ſalvation, ſtands onely betwixt
God the Father, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,
who hath undertaken to performe all that
was neceſſary for the ſalvation of his Elect.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="223" facs="tcp:152344:118"/>
That the Covenant of grace was made with
Jeſus Chriſt; appeares by theſe Reaſons.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe the word <hi>him,</hi> in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
number, noteth onely one Perſon; My
Covenant ſhall ſtand faſt with [<hi>him</hi>] The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
are many, therefore its not made with
them in this ſence I here ſpeake for; there is
a difference between the word <hi>him,</hi> and the
word <hi>them:</hi> he ſaith, <hi>My faithfulneſſe, and my
mercy ſhall be with him,</hi> &amp;c. 24.</p>
                     <p>2. Becauſe Chriſt is called the <hi>Covenant,</hi>
becauſe it hath dependance on him; <hi>I will
give thee for a Covenant of the people,</hi> Iſa 42. 6,
7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 49. 9. The Elect are not called a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
I grant they ſhare in the priviledges of
it, but its in relation to Chriſt, and as they
are conſidered in him: hence it is God ſaith,
<hi>he will ſhew them his Covenant,</hi> Pſal. 25. 14.
to comfort them with it.</p>
                     <p>3. Chriſt onely is ingaged to performe the
conditions of this Covenant, becauſe he hath
undertaken it, he hath ſealed, confirmed, and
fulfilled the Covenant with his bloud, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his bloud is called <hi>the bloud of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
Heb. 13. 20. Our bloud is not the bloud
of the Covenant.</p>
                     <p>4. It was of neceſſity that this Covenant
ſhould be made with Chriſt, and him onely,
becauſe he alone was able to keepe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of it; it required a great ſtrength to
keep this Covenant: therefore the Lord ſaith,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:152344:119"/>
                        <hi>I have laid helpe upon one that is mighty; thou

13. We are weake, even weakneſſe it ſelfe,
utterly unable to effect ſuch a worke; it had
been in vaine to have laid ſo great a work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                     <p>5. If man had been to performe any of the
conditions of this Covenant, it had not been
a covenant of grace, but a covenant of works;
for, <hi>if it be of works, is not of grace,</hi> Rom. 4. 4, 5.
Nor were the covenant of grace free and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute,
if it were conditionall, for that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is not abſolute, which depends upon any
condition to be by us performed, but to us
the covenant is free and abſolute, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unconditionall on mans part, therefore
its a covenant of grace, it coſt Chriſt deare,
his very life, that it might coſt us nothing.</p>
                     <p>6. <hi>If this covenant had been made with us,
and ſo had depended upon our obedience,
then might our ſin have broke the covenant,
and ſo deprived us of ſalvation; which cannot
be; for ſin cannot deprive any of the Elect
of ſalvation; for God ſaith,</hi> My covenant ſhall
ſtand faſt with him; his ſeed alſo will I make

tranſgreſsions with a rod, and their iniquitie
with ſtripes. Nevertheleſſe, my loving kindneſſe
will I not utterly take from him, nor ſuffer my
faithfulneſſe to faile; my Covenant will I not
breake, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my
lips, <hi>Pſal. 89. 28. to 38. Theſe words doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
fully and clearly declare, that the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of grace depends not upon our good
duties, nor can be broken by our ſins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. If the covenant of grace had depended
upon our actings towards God, then had the
counſell of God appeared to be mutable,
which is contrary to <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 17.</p>
                     <p>8. If this covenant had depended upon
our keeping the conditions, we could not be
certain of our ſalvation becauſe we might not
performe the conditions; at leaſt greatly
doubt whether wee had performed them or
no; for if <hi>Adam</hi> in his greateſt ſtrength fell,
how ſhall we in our weakneſſe ſtand?</p>
                     <p>9. If we had been to performe the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to pertake of the covenant of grace,
then could not wee have ſtrong conſolation,
becauſe wee ſhould be under care and feare
leaſt we ſhould come ſhort. Now God to free
us from care and feare herein, he made ſure
the covenant with Jeſus Chriſt for him to
keepe; therefore to make it ſure, and to free
us from all doubt, he <hi>confirmed it by an Oath:</hi>
the reaſon why he did ſo, is rendred, that <hi>we
might have ſtrong conſolation wherein God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

(oath and promiſe) <hi>wee might have ſtrong
conſolation,</hi> Heb. 6. 17, 18. Our conſolation
is farre more ſtronger, that all is finiſhed, and
confirmed by Chriſt, then to have ſo weighty
a matter (upon which depends our eternall
happineſſe) to depend upon the good acts of
a weake, uncertaine, and vaine man, whoſe
breath is in his noſtrels.</p>
                     <p>10. Laſtly, it tends moſt to the advantage,
to the riches and glory of Gods grace, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing
man, to eſtabliſh the covenant with
Chriſt, ſo as to leave none of this worke for
man to doe, for if man were to doe the leaſt
part of that worke, on which depended our
eternall happineſſe, in ſtead of giving God
the glory, <hi>we would boaſt.</hi> Therefore to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
this, he hath eſtabliſhed the covenant
with Chriſt, who <hi>hath wrought our works for
us;</hi> and hath not left any of this worke for
us to doe; ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 18.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obſ.</hi> The covenant of grace is unutterable,
its a faſt and ſure covenant, its an everlaſting
covenant, it cannot be broke, therefore all
the Elect ſhall certainly have happineſſe and
glory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>We have the word of the Lord to confirme
this; for God ſaith;</hi> My Covenant ſhall ſtand,

after the thing that is gone out of my lips, <hi>v.</hi> 34.
The Covenant of my peace ſhall not be removed,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 10. I have ſaid, Mercy ſhall be built up
for ever; <hi>yea, he hath ſworne it;</hi> Once have I
ſwornely my holineſſe, that I will not lie unto
Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 35. God is not as man that be

which will alſo doe it.</p>

conceive the covenant is made with man, or
that reach faith to be a condition of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
                     <p>2. That the happineſſe of the children of
Chriſt, depends upon the ſtability of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
ſeeing that is ſure and unalterable,
therefore their happineſſe is ſure and unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
<hi>Nothing ſhall ſeparate us,</hi> &amp;c. Sin can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
nor ſhall not, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 38, 39.</p>
                     <p>3. That our eternall happineſſe doth not
depend upon our works, nor upon our ſelves,
but upon Jeſus Chriſt, in what he hath done
for us.</p>
                     <p>4. That all that are Chriſts, need not feare
nor doubt of eternall life, becauſe they are
included in the priviledges of the covenant.</p>
                     <p>5. This informes us of the greatneſſe and
freeneſſe of Gods love, in that God requires
nothing of us to have an intereſt in this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and are ever to be in this his <hi>everlaſting

yea inward comforts, this covenant affords
much comfort, this might ſatisfie us in all our

                     <p>PEace is rare, choice, and precious; its

                        <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. In that the Apoſtle prayeth, that
God would give the Saints, the Church of God
peace; it appeares, that ſuch as are the Lords
may want peace: and that this is a truth, ſee
and conſider, Pſal. 88. 15, 16. Job 19. 10, 11.
&amp; 7. 6. 13, 14, 15, 16. Pſal. 31. 22. Pſal. 55. 5.

21. 13, 14 Pſal. 51. 12. So that it is one thing
to be a childe of God, and another thing to
have peace.</p>
                     <p>Now the God of peace himſelfe give you peace.</p>

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:152344:123"/>
to give peace, they may ſpeake peace, but
they cannot give peace: God is called <hi>the
Lord of peace;</hi> to teach us, that it is at his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing,
none have any power to order and
give peace but himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>To give peace requires an almighty power;
its a creation, <hi>he creats the fruit of the lips
peace,</hi> Pſal. 57. 10. He alone can empty the
ſoule of its feares and terrors, and place peace
in the ſoule. When men ſpeake peace, the
ſoule refuſeth, is ſet upon a will, they will not
receive it: thus <hi>David, My ſoule refuſed to be
comforted,</hi> Pſal. 77. 2. Man is not able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
the will, and over-power the ſoule, but
Gods perſwaſions are to purpoſe, becauſe they
are effectuall.</p>
                     <p>If men could give peace, God ſhould looſe

this ſhould teach us in the want of peace, to
goe to God for it.</p>
                     <p>2. It ſhould teach ſuch as injoy any peace,
how ſmall ſoever it appeares in their eyes, to
be thankfull to God for it, for its from his
mercy and loving kindneſſe that we injoy it.</p>
                     <p>Obſ. 3. The Lord himſelfe give you peace
by all meanes.</p>
                     <p>God conveys peace to his people, in, and
by meanes.</p>
                     <p>Meanes cannot give peace, but God gives

2. Examine from whence all thy diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
come, and you ſhall finde they
come not from God; for his voice is peace
and comfort to his; <hi>I know the thoughts that
I thinke towards you, ſaith the Lord, thoughts
of peace, and not of evill,</hi> Jer. 29. 11. <hi>Comfort

warfare is accompliſhed, that her iniquitie is
pardoned,</hi> Iſa. 42. 1, 2. You ſee they come not
from God, nor doe they come from Chriſt;
it was promiſed of Chriſt, that he ſhould
ſpeake peace; <hi>Thy King cometh, he ſhall ſpeak
peace unto the heathen,</hi> Zach. 9. 9, 10. This is
his work, and he doth it, therefore he doth
not trouble nor diſcourage any; <hi>He binds up
the broken hearted; he proclaims peace and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
he comforts all that mourne; he gives
beauty for aſhes; the oyle of joy for mourning;
and garments of praiſe, for the ſpirit of heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
&amp;c. Iſa. 61. 1, 2, 3. Luk. 4. 18. He is
gracious and pitifull; <hi>He will not quench the
ſmoaking flax, nor breake the bruiſed reed,</hi> Iſa.
42. 3. His voice is full of love and tendernes;
his words are ſweet words; as, <hi>Let not your
hearts be troubled,</hi> Joh. 13. 1. <hi>Feare not, it is
your fathers pleaſure to give you a Kingdome,</hi>
Luk. 12. 32. <hi>Caſt your care upon me, I will care
for you,</hi> Phil. 4. 6. Chriſts voice is, <hi>Open to me
my ſiſter, my love, my dove, my undefiled,</hi> Song
5. 2. What ſweet words are here, all tending
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:152344:125"/>
to peace and comfort, not the leaſt word of
diſcouragement or trouble; his name is King
of <hi>Salem,</hi> that is, <hi>King of peace,</hi> Heb. 7. 2.
Its evident then our fears &amp; diſcouragements
come not from Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Nor come they from the holy Spirit of God,
for he is the great and moſt ſweet Comforter,
he cauſeth no diſcouragement, but removes
them all, by revealing and applying to the
ſoule the love of God, and carrieth the ſoule
by faith from all diſcouragements to God,
who is love and peace, where the ſoule is <hi>to
reſt,</hi> Pſal. 116. 7. and be filled with ſweet peace.
This is the worke the Spirit doth, hence it is
he is called <hi>the comforter,</hi> Joh. 15. 16. He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

                     <p>The conſideration that our feares, doubts,

them, or be troubled for them, but ſlight
them. But may a ſoule ſay from whence then
doe they come?</p>
                     <p>1. They come from the Devill, who is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious

                     <p>5. Learne to know and diſtinguiſh between
the voice of the Goſpel, and the voice of the
Law; the Law ſaith, <hi>Curſed is every one that
continueth not in all things that are wristen in
the Law to doe them,</hi> Gal. 3. 10, 11. When
there is any worke to be done upon paine of
puniſhment, or upon promiſe of eternall life,
its the voice of the Law, the Law requires a
doing ſomething for life. <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribing
the Righteouſneſſe of the Law, ſaith, <hi>That the
man that doth theſe things, ſhall live by them,</hi>
Rom. 10. 5. But the voice of the Goſpel is
otherwiſe; as, that <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us
from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe
for us,</hi> Gal. 3. 13. and <hi>that his mercy is above
what we can aske or thinke,</hi> Eph. 3. 20. So
the promiſes of life are free without conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
the Goſpel declares what God workes in
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:152344:127"/>
us, and freely gives to us; <hi>I will love them
freely,</hi> Hoſ. 14. 4. If we did more liſten to the
promiſe, which is the voice of the Goſpel,
and not to the voice of the Law, and the voice
of corruption, we ſhould injoy more peace,
and leſſe trouble.</p>
                     <p>6. Meddle not with the threatnings in the
Word, to apply them to thy ſoule, becauſe
they belong not unto it, they are no part
of thy portion, they concerne not the ſtate
of a beleever (however they may be of uſe
to prevent ſinne) yet are of no uſe to him
after ſin is committed; its a weakneſſe in a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever
having ſinned to apply the threatnings
againſt ſinne to himſelfe, becauſe we are not
under the Law, but under grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14.
Chriſt being made a curſe for us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13.
hath made full ſatisfaction for the ſins of the
Elect. Reckon your ſelves to be dead indeed
unto ſin, but alive unto God through Jeſus
Chriſt our Lord, <hi>Rom. 6. 10, 11. Rom.</hi> 6. 7.
It is againſt reaſon, ſight, ſence, and feeling,
to reckon ſo, but we are to walke by faith,
and not by fight, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7.</p>
                     <p>7. See that yee doe not judge your eſtate
by falſe principles; ſome judge their ſtate to
be bad for the want of that which if they had
it, it would not prove their ſtate good; as,
knowledge, memory, parts, ſenſibleneſſe of
ſin, &amp;c. nor judge thy ſtate to be bad, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of that which if thou wert freed from,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:152344:128"/>
would not prove thy ſtate good; as, paſſion,
temptation, diſcontentedneſſe, &amp;c. If this rule
were obſerved by ſome more, they ſhould
not be ſo troubled as they are.</p>
                     <p>8. Take heed yee be not overwhelmed with
ſinne, doe not eye ſo much thy infirmities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of ſuch a minding, and complaining of
ſinne, as may diſcourage, oppreſſe, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thy ſoule; this is ſinfull; our experience
might teach us this, as well as it did <hi>David;
I complained, and my ſpirit was overwhelmed,
I am ſo troubled that I cannot ſpeake,</hi> Pſal. 77.
3, 4. 8. Therefore hearken not to thy failings,
corruptions, doubts, and feares, ſo as to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
&amp;c. For as they are all againſt God,
ſo they are all againſt thy ſoule, there is no
grace or mercy to be expected from them in
this ſence: what thou ſeeſt and feeleſt, ſee not,
conſider not, forget; and what thy ſence ſees
not, ſee; <hi>Faith is the evidence of things not
ſeene,</hi> Heb. 11. 1. <hi>Walke by faith, and not by
ſight,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 7.</p>
                     <p>9. Eye Chriſt onely, minde him, meditate
upon him, and his rich and free grace; fetch
all thy comfort from him, <hi>who is made to thee,
Wiſdome, Righteouſneſſe, Sanctification,</hi> and
<hi>Redemption,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 30. If thou wilt attend
onely to God in his promiſe, thou ſhalt finde
<hi>Reſt,</hi> Pſal. 116. 7. O ſoule, eye not ſo much
thy ſelfe, or thy ſinnes, as Chriſts full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
ſatisfaction, which was offered and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:152344:128"/>
for all thy ſinnes; therefore live and reſt
thy ſoule upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt alone,
and place all thy confidence in him; doe you
not heare Chriſt ſay; Caſt away all thy feares,
and come to me, I will ſettle thee, comfort,
quicken, and uphold thee, and be better to
thee then thy ſelfe can be, yea all in all to
thee.</p>
                     <p>10. Know and minde the happineſſe of a
beleever in Chriſt, <hi>he is cleane from all ſinne,</hi>
1 Joh. 1. 7. <hi>They are removed from us,</hi> Pſ. 103.
12. Meditate on this truth, untill thy heart be
over-powred with it, and enjoy the ſweetneſſe
of it; ever minde what is thy freedome and
liberty thou haſt in Chriſt, which is full and
ſweet, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 13.</p>
                     <p>11. Learne to diſtinguiſh between thy Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,
and thy perſonall Sanctification:
the firſt is perfect and compleat in Chriſt; the
latter is in our ſelves, and is weak and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine;
untill a ſoule be ſetled in the point of
Juſtification, the ſoules objections cannot be
anſwered; he that underſtands not the true
nature and doctrine of Juſtification, cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
true ſetled conſtant peace and conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for in the right underſtanding of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
lieth the life of the Saints comfort.</p>
                     <p>12. Let not thy comfort depend upon thy
perſonall Sanctification, becauſe from it there
can no ſure ſetled conſtant comfort flow, the
ſeeking of comfort from our Sanctification, is
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:152344:129"/>
a cauſe of much trouble in many weake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers;
Sanctification hath nothing to doe
with Juſtification, nor Salvation, as any cauſe
of it. Alſo Sanctification admits of degrees,
but Juſtification admits of neither rules nor
degrees, and is more glorious then Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
our Juſtification ſhould comfort us;
Juſtification depends not upon our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
it, not in our receiving it, but upon
what the Lord Jeſus hath done for us. Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is effected by Chriſt, and its appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
by faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. The Spirit and
faith doth evidence to us our Juſtification;
<hi>all that beleeve are Juſtified,</hi> Acts 13. 39. Its
poſſible to have <hi>a full aſſurance of faith,</hi> Heb.
10. 22. Faith is an unqueſtionable evidence,
and when faith is hidden and doubtfull, Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
is not apprehended, and when faith
is hidden and doubtfull, Sanctification is not
evident but doubtfull, and ſo cannot evidence
to us our Juſtification. The effects of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
cauſe men to queſtion their Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
therefore no effect of Sanctification can
evidence to the ſoule its Juſtification: and
the ſoule that apprehends his Juſtification by
Chriſt, not onely knoweth it, but may live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, and injoy the ſweet fruit of it, peace,
joy, ſtrength, without any ſanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
Seeing Chriſt is made Sanctification to
a beleever, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. why may not a ſoule
live upon that, and ſay, I have Sanctification
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:152344:129"/>
in Chriſt, which is perfect; my actuall Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
doth often faile me, but his indures
for ever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111. 3. Therefore I will fetch
all my comfort from Chriſt, and my Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by him. And as we are not to conclude
our Juſtification from any effect of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſo we are not to conclude that appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of Juſtification to be from God, as
ſhall take men off the meanes and rules of
Sanctification, becauſe its a diſhonour for men
not to walke holily, according to the word of
God, <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 14.</p>
                     <p>13. Be ſure yee allow your ſelfe in no ſin,
but in the ſtrength of God hate and abhorre
with the greateſt indignation all ſin, and the
appearance of it, it is better to die then to
ſin. There is that which accompanieth ſin,
which ſtrikes at a beleevers peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
it will damp, ſtraighten and oppreſſe the
ſoule, it will hinder their comfort, joy, and
peace in God, unleſſe God doth wonderfully
ſtrengthen their faith in him; we finde by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
that ſin is a let to our faith and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
it having often unſetled and diſquieted
us in our peace &amp; comfort, though we ought
not to be ſo.</p>
                     <p>14. Trouble not thy ſelfe with the feare of
what may befall thee, in caſe thou wert cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
great troubles ſhall befall thee, be not
troubled at any trouble, much leſſe at future
troubles, nor thinke to encounter with &amp; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:152344:130"/>
a future trouble with a preſent ſtrength;
if many and great troubles come, God is
all-ſufficient, he will remove them, or give
ſtrength to beare them when they come,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13.</p>
                     <p>15. Minde ſeriouſly thoſe promiſes that
are ſutable to thy condition, and apply them,
God hath imparted himſelfe in his promiſe,
and it is our wiſdome and duty to reſt upon
it: <hi>Seperate thy ſelfe</hi> to meditate on them,
<hi>Pro.</hi> 18. 2. There is ſtrength and ſweetneſſe
in the promiſe, thou maiſt ſafely venture thy

it; thou knoweſt not but God may reveale the
promiſe more to thee in thy meditation of it,
and ſettle it by his almighty power upon thy
ſoule, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 19, 20. Let not the promiſe
of God be ſtrange to thee; be not willing to
leave a promiſe, untill thou beeſt refreſhed by
it, yea raiſed and raviſhed with thankfulneſſe
for the <hi>exceeding riches of his mercy,</hi> Eph. 2.
9. <hi>his plenteous redemption.</hi> Pſal. 130. 7. The

quiet and ſettle a troubled ſoule, its ſo full of
ſweetneſſe and life.</p>
                     <p>16. Remember the dayes of old: <hi>I have
conſidered the dayes of old, and the yeares of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

Pſal. 63. 7. <hi>I was brought low, and he helped me,</hi>

he will helpe me: if thou didſt treaſure up
the experiences of Gods goodneſſe to thy

Iſa. 42. 23.</p>
                     <p>17. Keep thy heart calme and quiet from
all paſſion, feare, and griefe; the ſtill ſoule can
beſt know and heare Chriſts voice; where
feare, vexation, and diſtemper dwells, they
are not aware of Chriſt, and themſelves, and
commonly they feare moſt who have leaſt
cauſe; as appeares, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 9, 10. When the
ſoule is troubled with paſſion, it is not at the
command of faith, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 41. the violence
of their joy hindered their faith; <hi>Let not your
hearts be troubled,</hi> Joh. 13. 1. If they be, you
cannot injoy God, nor your ſelves; quietneſſe
is the ſtay of the ſoule to doe or receive; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
by ſuppoſed feares, draw upon themſelves
reall ſorrowes, ând unneceſſary diſcontents;
many are poſſeſſed with bitter ſorrowes from
ſuppoſed ſufferings.</p>
                     <p>18. Be content with thy preſent eſtate, and
ſill not thy head, heart, or hand, with more
buiſineſſe, then thou muſt needs; Conſider,
<hi>Heb. 13. 5. Take heed of the cares of this life,</hi>
Luk. 21. 34. 15.</p>
                     <p>19. Order thy converſation aright; <hi>To him
that ordereth his converſation aright, will I

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:152344:131"/>
of wiſdome to diſpoſe, and want of diligence
to diſpatch, what neceſſity requires to be

ſuch inconveniences, as have unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

                     <p>20. Walk with God in his wayes, ordinances,
and meanes appointed by him for thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
ſtrength, joy, and peace in him: there is

14. 10, 11. Uſe the meanes, and live upon

                     <p>22. Reſt ſatisfied in Chriſts righteouſneſſe,
and adde nothing to it; <hi>I will make mention
of thy righteouſneſſe, even of thine onely,</hi> ſee
<hi>Pſal. 71. 15, 16. 19. 24. Thy righteouſneſſe

<hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 6.</p>
                     <p>23. Meditate on the goodneſſe of God;

O God,</hi> Pſal. 48. 9.</p>
                     <p>24. <hi>Above all, take the ſhield of faith,</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.
6. 16. Beleeve in God: <hi>Yee beleeve in
God, beleeve alſo in me;</hi> and, <hi>Let not your hearts

<hi>Rev. 3. 11. 1 Pet, 4. 19. &amp;</hi> 5. 7.</p>
                     <p>26. Renounce all lying vanities, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

                     <p>Hearken not to Satan.</p>
                     <p>Hearken not to ſence; <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaid, <hi>he would

1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. and is condemned, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 16.
Some perſons will ſee a holy frame of ſpirit in

finde by experience, nothing will remove the
ſoules doubts and diſcouragements, but the
word of God: the word diſcovers to the ſoule
the love of God; it conveys to the ſoule that
which is ſutable to ſettle it; carnall reaſon
cannot ſettle the ſoule, but the word can;
when God diſcovers his power and authoritie
in it, then all doubts, &amp;c. gives place. So we
finde that according as we cleave to the word
of the Lord, our doubts and diſcouragements
vaniſh; and as we cleave to lying vanities,
our feares and diſcouragements increaſe, <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi>
2. 8. When God pleaſes to ſettle a ſoule

<hi>Remember the word unto thy ſervant, upon

You had better make the word of God your

and that meanes alone are not ſufficient to

lie in our ſelves, in nothing that is in us, or

then it muſt needs follow, that the Saints can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
poſſibly make it away, or looſe it, becauſe
it is not in us, and ſo not in our keeping, but
is <hi>in him. Adam</hi> had his righteouſneſſe in him,
and he loſt it, but ſeeing it is in Chriſt, in him
it cannot be loſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obſ.</hi> If the Saints Righteouſneſſe be in
Chriſt, then all the Saints are alike righteous,
the meaneſt and weakeſt as the beſt, he hath
as much righteouſneſſe in Chriſt as any, and is
as much accepted by it as the beſt: as Chriſt
hath righteouſneſſe enough for them all, ſo it
is alike for them all; as they are in Chriſt, they
are alike perfect, righteous, and glorious:
they that doe moſt for Chriſt, doe beſt, but
they have no more righteouſneſſe then the
reſt; all the Elect are alike <hi>cloathed with the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:152344:141"/>
garment of ſalvation, and covered with the robe
of righteouſneſſe;</hi> therefore they may all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce

                     <p>2. It is a common deceit of Satan to tell
a ſoule, God hath no mercy for him, when the
ſoule hath obtained mercy, or when it is not
farre from him.</p>
                     <p>3. It is certaine theſe thoughts come from
Satan, becauſe they are contrary to God in
his Word, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 2, 3, 4.</p>
                     <p>4. Its the nature of unbeliefe to be inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:152344:144"/>
and curious, to finde out any pretence,
that he may ſeeme to doe well in not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening
to what God ſaith in his Word, <hi>Heb.</hi>
10. 14.</p>
                     <p>5. We muſt not yeeld to Satan, nor hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
unto him: trouble not thy thoughts
with Election, but minde Jeſus Chriſt; doe
you waite upon him in the uſe of means, till
he give thee faith, and then thou ſhalt know
thou art elected, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 48.</p>
                     <p>But I have uſed the meanes, and I am worſe
and worſe, therefore God will not doe me good.</p>
                     <p>1. Doe you know Gods meanes, and the
number of them? have your ends been good,
and right placed? have you uſed them in a
right manner, meaſure, time, in ſincerity?
have you not reſted on the means? have you
uſed them in faith, expecting his bleſſing?
<hi>The word they heard, profited them not, for
want of faith,</hi> Heb. 4. 2.</p>
                     <p>2. Its no good reaſon to ſay, Becauſe God
hath not as yet given me my requeſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he never will; conſider <hi>Iſa. 64. 4. Iſa.</hi> 8.
17. <hi>They which had not obtained mercy did,</hi>

                     <p>3. It is juſt with God to blaſt the meanes,
yea its a mercy, that we might looke more to
Chriſt in the uſe of meanes, to bleſſe them,
and be all unto us.</p>
                     <p>4. If thou haſt a will that Chriſt ſhould

ſave thee, and rule thee, he that hath begun
this good worke in thee will finiſh it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.
2. One day thou ſhalt know thy ſinnes to be
pardoned and ſubdued.</p>
                     <p>5. Conſider God may have mercy for thee,
though thou knoweſt it not; for mens ſinnes
are firſt forgiven, before they can know it, or
beleeve it, or be aſſured of it; therefore thy
ſinnes may be pardoned, though thou doeſt
not know it: faith beleeves ſin is pardoned,
but our beleeving neither pardons any ſinne,
nor procures the pardon of it.</p>
                     <p>I have waited a long time, and many others
have receeved mercy, but I have not.</p>
                     <p>1. Some of the Lords have waited a long
time, at leaſt they thought the time long:
<hi>David</hi> ſaid; <hi>I am weary of my crying, my throat
is dryed, my eyes faile while I waite for my God,</hi>
Pſal. 69. 3.</p>
                     <p>2. If God hath given thee a heart to waite
upon him, thou art bleſſed; <hi>Bleſſed are all they
that waite for him,</hi> Iſa. 30. 18. Waiting im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
perſeverance, patience, long ſuffering in
holding out, notwithſtanding the tediouſneſs
of the time deferred: courage in breaking
through all difficulties that ſtand between
waiting, and to continue waiting, though all
things ſeeme contrary, till we injoy what we
waite for; <hi>I waite for my God,</hi> Pſal. 69. 3.</p>
                     <p>But I am now old in yeares, and if God had
intended mercy for me, ſurely he would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:152344:145"/>
it before this time, and now death is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to take me away.</p>
                     <p>1. Yet mercy may come at laſt; the theefe
was ſaved upon the Croſſe, <hi>Mat. 20. Luk.</hi> 23.
Oh how neere was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he unto his end, before
mercy came to him.</p>
                     <p>2. You muſt not ſet a time to God, its
mercy though it come at laſt: God uſeth to
call ſome the <hi>laſt houre</hi> as well as the third;
ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 1. to 10. There is nothing too
hard for God.</p>
                     <p>If I were fitted with qualifications, as hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe,
brokenneſſe of heart, and tooke delight
to heare and pray, as others, I could have hope,
<hi>but its not ſo with me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. This is nothing but a deluſion, for theſe
things cannot fit thy ſoule for mercy; while
yee look and reſt on ſuch things as theſe, yee
<hi>ſeeke the living among the deid,</hi> Luk 24. 5. If
you had theſe things yee deſire in the greateſt
meaſure ever any had, they could nor procure
thy happineſſe, nor ſtand thee in any ſtead, to
ſave thy ſoule, nothing but Jeſus Chriſt can
doe that, nor any thing but him truly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
thee.</p>
                     <p>2. What qualifications had they in <hi>Ezek.</hi>
16. 3. to 9. except ſinfull ones; and what
qualifications had they who <hi>were enemies,</hi> yet
Chriſt dyed for them, <hi>Rom 5. 9, 10. Iſa.</hi> 65.
1, 2, 3. Its a certaine truth, that all that are
ſaved are ſaved freely, without any cauſe or
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:152344:146"/>
condition in man; ſee 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9, 10.</p>
                     <p>3. What need yee Chriſt, if yee have what
yee need without him.</p>
                     <p>4. As in nature none can worke before
they have life; ſo none can worke a ſpirituall
worke before he live ſpiritually: Chriſt muſt
be in the ſoule before it can beleeve, ſo the
ſoule muſt beleeve, before it can finde any
ſanctification, or any good worke at all in
himſelfe: conſider there is nothing to be done
by man to be a preparation to ſanctification;
ſee <hi>Rom. 4. 5. &amp;</hi> 5. 8. 10.</p>
                     <p>5. You goe a wrong way to worke, you goe
about to eſtabliſh a righteouſneſſe of thy own,
therefore thou doeſt ſo much thirſt after it,
but it muſt be renounced, its hard to be taken
off our own works, &amp; ſelfe-concurrence: ſtrip
a man of his own, and yee take away his life;
he muſt and will have ſomething, ſome hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe,
teares, good works, ſomething they
muſt have, they thinke it cannot be that one
ſhould be accepted, pardoned, and ſaved, and
to doe nothing at all for it: yet it is ſo.</p>
                     <p>Many when they ſee they have not done
well, they goe about to breake their hearts,
to make God amends for all, and thinke if
they can but attaine to ſuch a deep meaſure
of humiliation and ſorrow for ſin, then they
thinke they have an evidence for heaven; alas,
this is an evidence of great ignorance, in that
they doe not ſee death in their beſt duties:
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:152344:146"/>
the Lord may ſay to them who work ſo hard
for life; <hi>Thou haſt found the life of thy hand,
therefore thou waſt not grieved,</hi> Iſa. 57. 10.
And ſo <hi>Comfort themſelves with their owne
ſparkes:</hi> ſorrow will follow ſuch comfort, <hi>Yee
ſhall lie downe in ſorrow,</hi> Iſa. 50. 11. When we
ſay, our good workes are not the way to life,
men eſteeme it a grievous error, yet Chriſt
ſaith, <hi>I am the way,</hi> Joh. 14. 6. Tell me, are
thy workes Chriſts or no, if no, then they are
not the way, if Chriſt ſay true, as he doth,
alſo if Jeſus Chriſt is to be unto us <hi>all in all,</hi>
Col. 3. 11. our beſt works are to be unto us
nothing at all: our workes doe not make us
the better before God, nor the more beloved
of God, but they declare us to be what we
are made by God. The Papiſts doe, as they
ſay, many good works to be ſaved, but we ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre
it, becauſe it is condemned of God:
<hi>Not of workes, leaſt we ſhould boaſt.</hi> If it were
of works, it were not of grace. Therefore all
thoſe that expect &amp; hope for mercy, becauſe
they leave their ſinnes, and doe many good
workes, as they thinke, alas, they are greatly
deluded, they are not taken off of ſelfe-works,
and ſelfe-concurrence with Chriſt, you are
<hi>ignorant of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
yee goe <hi>about to eſtabliſh your own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,</hi>
and ſo long as yee doe ſo, yee <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſubmit to the righteouſneſſe of God,</hi> ſee <hi>Rom.</hi>
10. 3. But if thou didſt know what a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:152344:147"/>
Chriſt is, thou wouldſt have prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it before thy own; yea it would be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by thee but <hi>dreſſe and dung</hi> to his, <hi>Phil.</hi>
3. 8, 9. Publicans and Harlots are neerer ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
then thee, as righteous as thou art,
who work for life, as the blind Phariſees did,
and periſhed, ſee <hi>Mat 21. 31, 32. Luk.</hi> 7. 29,
30. We are not commanded to doe any thing
to procure the pardon of our ſinnes, but in
reference to ſervice and duty: I doe count my
ſelfe never the nearer heaven, for my beſt
works, then if I had never done any thing but
ſwore and blaſphemed God; its <hi>to him that
worketh not,</hi> Rom. 4. 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>We are ſaved
not according to our workes, but according to
his own purpoſe and grace,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 9 Doth
not God ſpeake plaine enough to the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in ſaying it is not according to our works:
<hi>And when we were enemies, we were reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to God by the death of his Son,</hi> Rom. 5. 10.
<hi>I will doe away thy offences for my Names ſake,</hi>
Iſa. 43. 25. <hi>When thou wert polluted in thy own
bloud, I ſaid unto thee live; then was the time
of love,</hi> Ezek. 16. 6. 8. From hence it is that
all that ſee this myſtery of Gods free grace,
that ſalvation is not according to our works;
they cry, grace, grace, Chriſt, Chriſt, Chriſt
is all in all, nothing but Chriſt, now all their
prayers, teares, duties, devotions, all of theirs
is nothing to them, in reſpect of their accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
juſtification, or ſalvation, they are dead
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:152344:147"/>
to working, they will not ſtirre to doe the
leaſt worke in the world to attaine any of
theſe, &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 10. All ours is vaniſhed in
the infinite ocean of Gods free love; its ſo
that God might have <hi>all the glory,</hi> Eph. 1. 6.
Jer. 9. 24. and that <hi>man might not boaſt,</hi> Rom.
3. 9. but obey <hi>God freely,</hi> Luk. 1. 74.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Spirit ſhall convince the world of ſin,
and of righteouſneſſe,</hi> Joh. 16. 7, 8, 9, 10.
God hath begun his worke in thee, if he hath
convinced thee of ſin, and of righteouſneſſe:
to be convinced of ſin, is for the ſoule to ſee it
ſelfe utterly loſt and undone by reaſon of ſin;
they confeſſe, <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Job 42. 6. <hi>They loath themſelves for
their deeds,</hi> Ezek. 20. 43.</p>
                     <p>2. The ſoule is convinced, ſo as to have no
hope in any thing it can doe to help it ſelfe;
this is to be undone in nature, ſo as he cannot
doe any thing from whence he may expect
ſalvation, or have any hope of it; for a man
cannot expect life and ſalvation from Chriſt
alone, untill the ſoule be taken off all other
things in reſpect of life. This viſion of God
cauſeth the ſoule to ſee themſelves, and ſay,
<hi>There remaineth no ſtrength in me, my comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is turned in me into corruption,</hi> Dan 10. 8.
That is, now the caſe is altered from what it
was, now my beſt workes, my righteouſneſſe
is defiled, and is ſin, now ſinfull-ſelfe, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous-ſelfe,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:152344:148"/>
are alike, if there be any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
the laſt is the worſt: now the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath nothing to procure Chriſt, nor no
ſtrength to beleeve in him; the Spirit of God
reveales to the ſoule that there is nothing but
darkneſſe and death in our beſt duties: it is
from grace to be taken off of nature; and he
that is taken off of nature hath grace, is borne
of God: When the ſoule is taken off its own
bottome, it muſt have another to reſt on, or
elſe it ſinkes, therefore when God takes away
the ſoules falſe foundation, which is her falſe
hopes, he gives the ſoule a better in himſelfe:
this is the <hi>teaching and drawing of the Father,</hi>
Joh. 6. That in Chriſt there is a ranſome, in
which is life; and that all that Chriſt hath
done is for him; and that nothing will ſtand
the ſoule in any ſtead but him; when the ſoule
hath learned this, there is a ſecret power go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with this teaching, and carrieth the ſoule
to Chriſt, to beleeve in him; for the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Father and faith, goeth together;
<hi>Every one that hath heard and learned of the
Father cometh unto me,</hi> Joh. 6. So that to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the ſoule of righteouſneſſe, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
it of Chriſt, to reveale that in him onely
is helpe, and in his righteouſneſſe is delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
<hi>I have laid helpe upon one that is migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
Pſal. 89. 19. So that the Lord doth fix and
ſettle the ſoule upon Chriſts righteouſneſſe
onely, at leaſt he puts the ſoule under the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:152344:148"/>
hope of it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 5, 6. When the ſoule
ſeeth nothing but death, God ſaith <hi>live,</hi> and
when the ſoule is a going downe into the pit,
God ſaith, <hi>Stay, hearken, I have received a
Ranſome for thee,</hi> ſee <hi>Job</hi> 34. 23, 24. Now
the ſoule wonders at the love of God in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
his ſinne, he is taken up, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 41.
43 Though for the meaſure it is not in all the
Lords alike.</p>
                     <p>The Spirit diſcovers to the ſoule, that it
hath choſen ſomething elſe beſides Chriſt,
upon which the ſoule reſteth, and ſatisfieth
her ſelfe withall, and expects mercy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
from, her beſt workes, and other lying
vanities; telling the ſoule, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but death in them: God by this teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
turneth the ſoule from darkneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> ſelfe,
Satan, and all other lying vanities, to light, to
Chriſt, where life is; telling the ſoule, there is
life in Chriſt, and that it need not ſeeke life in
nothing elſe, but to waite upon Chriſt for it,
and that the ſoule ſhall not looſe its waiting,
but ſhall certainly have it at laſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 13.
Theſe things are wrought in ſome meaſure:
Some are ſtrong, others are weake, and are
called <hi>carnall,</hi> and not <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> yet they are
<hi>babes in Chriſt;</hi> therefore they were in a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
ſtate, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 1. 3. In the ſame meaſure
this work is wrought in the ſoule, in the ſame
meaſure faith is wrought; and as it appeares
to the ſoule, ſo faith appeares to the ſoule.</p>

                        <pb n="284" facs="tcp:152344:149"/>
I know not whether I may beleeve; for ſome
ſhall not be ſaved.</p>
                     <p>The Scripture doth declare, that <hi>he that
beleeves ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Joh. 3. 16. You are to
reſt ſatisfied in the Word of God.</p>
                     <p>But I have no love to Chriſt, I am an enemy
to Chriſt, and not fit for Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>1. The reaſon you doe not love Chriſt, is
becauſe thou doeſt not know Gods love to
thee; <hi>Wee love him, becauſe he loved us firſt,</hi>
1 Joh. 4. 19. As ſoone as we know Gods love
to us, that love conſtraines us to love him,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14.</p>
                     <p>2. Art thou an enemy to God, ſo were all
that ever did beleeve; ſee <hi>Eph<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. 12, 13. While
we were enemies, we were reconciled to God
by the death of his Sonne,</hi> Rom. 5. 8. 10. Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
cannot deſerve Chriſt, yet God gives
Chriſt to ſuch.</p>
                     <p>3. Its a fooliſh conceit to thinke of fitting
thy ſelfe for Chriſt, it can never be.</p>
                     <p>4. If thou deſireſt Chriſt, goe to him, and
you ſhall ſpeed; <hi>He that cometh to me, I will
in no wiſe caſt out,</hi> Joh. 6. 37. You ſee, you
have his word for it; alſo Chriſt is in you, if
you deſire him; for no man can <hi>hunger and
thirſt after righteouſneſſe</hi> (that is, Chriſt) <hi>but
ſuch as are bleſſed,</hi> Mat. 5. 6. They that are
led out of themſelves to Chriſt, for light, and
life, and ſtrength, are the children of God,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9, 10, 11, 14. This deſire is from the

in-being of the light and life of Chriſt in
you.</p>
                     <p>Indeed there are many great and ſweet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
in the Word, but they are all for beleevers,
but I am none.</p>
                     <p>I grant none may apply a promiſe of life,
but ſuch as beleeve, yet the promiſes are for
all the Elect, thou doeſt not know but thou
art one of them; when God ſhall give thee
faith, thou ſhalt know thou haſt an intereſt in
them, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 48. In the meane time, ſtay
thy ſelfe with this, that the Lord Jeſus gave

deceived, its no eaſie matter to be ſaved, you

they are not ſo humbled, nor ſo qualified, and

they ſcare them exceedingly with the

for when the ſoule ſeeth it ſelfe loſt,
the firſt thing they are to doe, is to beleeve in

to it: ſo in ſpirituall things, for as no ſoule
can be ſenſible of the want of Chriſt, untill
the ſoule be poſſeſſed of him, <hi>Rom</hi> 8. 10, 11.
ſo no ſoule can deſire Chriſt above all things
in the world, unleſſe Chriſt had their hearts,
and they dearely loved him, and beleeve in
him; <hi>Chriſt is precious to them that beleeve,</hi>
1 Pet. 2. 7. Therefore ſuch as eſteeme Chriſt
precious, doe beleeve.</p>
                     <p>So the ſeate of faith is in the heart, which
is the underſtanding and will, but more prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
in the will, ſo that if our wills be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed,
our hearts are renewed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 5, 6.
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>To will is preſent with me, good I
would doe, ſo then with my minde I ſerve the
law of God,</hi> Rom. 7. 18, 19. with 21. 15. By
which it appeares, the will is one with the
minde, and the heart is one with them; theſe
three are one, and alwayes goe together, and
are alike ſpirituall: Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Where your
treaſure is, there will your hearts be alſo,</hi> that is
the minde, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 21. And by affections in
<hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3. 2. is meant the heart; <hi>Set your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
on things above;</hi> So that the heart,
and the affections are one thing.</p>
                     <p>Many beleeve, and yet doe not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they beleeve or no; ſo that they doe as

Mark. 9. 24. So many miſ-take faith, ſome

2. To beleeve that Jeſus is the Chriſt,
which implies a ſeeing and knowing all to be
in Chriſt for life, and to truſt in him for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and life, to reſt upon him for it: he that
thus beleeves in Chriſt, is brought over to
Chriſt, and ſo centered upon him, that it will
not goe from him: as <hi>Peter, Whither ſhall we
goe, thou haſt the words of eternall life,</hi> Joh. 6.
58. <hi>My ſoule waite thou on God, for my expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
is from him,</hi> Pſal. 62. 5. This no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
can doe.</p>
                     <p>As for the application of Chriſt, as their
own in particular, this all that beleeve have
not attained, this is not ſo much of the nature
of faith, as aſſurance to know all is in Chriſt,
no way or meanes of life but him, and to reſt
upon him for it; is more then illumination,
or ſaying ſo.</p>
                     <p>The Scriptures clearly prove, that to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
Jeſus Chriſt to be the Sonne of God, is
the faith of the Goſpel; I prove by theſe
Reaſons.</p>
                     <p>1. Becauſe this is the faith which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
preached, and witneſſed unto; and the
faith that is recorded to us in the Scriptures,
ſee <hi>Acts 18. 28. 1 Joh.</hi> 2. 22.</p>
                     <p>Our ſalvation depends upon the faith of
what God ſaith.</p>
                     <p>2. None can ſay, that Jeſus is the Lord, but
by the Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3.</p>
                     <p>3. Becauſe upon the profeſſion of this,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:152344:153"/>
Chriſt builds his Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 16. 18.</p>
                     <p>4. Becauſe upon the profeſſion of this, the
Baptiſme of Chriſt is to be diſpenſed, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.
37.</p>
                     <p>5. They who have this faith, <hi>dwell in God,
and God in them,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 15.</p>
                     <p>6. Becauſe God reveales this to the ſoule,
<hi>fleſh and bloud</hi> cannot doe it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 16, 17.</p>
                     <p>7. <hi>Such are</hi> borne of God; Whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves,
that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is borne of God,
1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 1.</p>
                     <p>8. This is the faith <hi>that overcometh the
world,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 4, 5.</p>
                     <p>9. Becauſe ſuch as beleeve this, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<hi>bleſſed,</hi> and <hi>ſhall never dye,</hi> John 11.
25, 26.</p>
                     <p>10. He that beleeves this ſhall be ſaved, <hi>as
appeares,</hi> Rom. 10. 9. Joh. 11. 25, 26.</p>
                     <p>There is a leſſer degree of faith, then a full
and certain aſſurance of life by Chriſt for him
in particular, <hi>Iſa. 45. 21, 22. Mat.</hi> 5. 3, 4, 5.
They had not this, yet were <hi>bleſſed,</hi> and <hi>ſhall
be ſatisfied;</hi> there is a hope of mercy, without
a certainty; ſuch are bleſſed; <hi>Turne yee to the
ſtrong holds, yee priſoners of hope,</hi> Zach. 9. 12.
<hi>They hope, and in his Name they doe truſt,</hi> Mat.
12. 21. A man may beleeve, and yet not know
that he hath eternall life. The Apoſtle ſaith,
<hi>Theſe things have I written unto you that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
on the Name of the Sonne of God, that yee
may know that yee have eternall life,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 13.
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:152344:153"/>
They had it, but they did not know ſo much,
they beleeved, yet had no aſſurance.</p>
                     <p>The people of God are ready to admit of
diſcouragements, when there is no cauſe, as
the Scriptures, and experience teſtifie: <hi>Mary</hi>
was troubled, and afraid, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 29, 30. All
the matter was, the <hi>Angel ſaluted her, and ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

Shee had found favour with God:</hi> So the <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards
were afraid when the Angel brought
them tydings of great joy,</hi> Luk. 2. 9, 10. So <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was afraid, when he drew up much fiſh,</hi>
Luk. 5. 8, 9. But what cauſe had theſe to
feare? God ſaith, <hi>Feare not, but beleeve:</hi> and
we feare when we ſhould beleeve, to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
of God, and the hindering our own
peace; therefore I ſhall name ſome of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements,
which hinder the Saints com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and indeavour to remove them.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Diſcourg.</hi> Some are diſcouraged and
thinke they have no worke of God in them,
becauſe <hi>they have not had ſo great a meaſure of
ſorrow for ſin as ſome have.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. All that beleeve, have not the ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of ſorrow for ſin; <hi>Lydia received the word
with joy,</hi> Acts 16. 14. but the <hi>Jaylor trembled,</hi>
being in feare, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 29.</p>
                     <p>2. The greateſt meaſure of ſorrow for ſin
any have had, was not the cauſe they were lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
or ſaved; its a great miſ-take to thinke,
God delights in feares or teares.</p>
                     <p>3. A deep ſenſibleneſſe of ſin, hinders the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:152344:154"/>
ſoules beleeving, and drives it from Chriſt, as
it did <hi>Peter,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Lord depart from me, for I
am a ſinfull man,</hi> Luk. 5. 8.</p>
                     <p>4. Doe not complaine that God deales
more gently with thee then others.</p>
                     <p>5. What is ſenſibleneſſe of ſin, that flowes
not from the apprehenſion of pardon &amp; love,
wee muſt not looke to our ſenſibleneſſe of fin,
but to Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>6. Our greateſt meaſure of ſenſibleneſſe of
ſin, is not free from ſin, it deſerves nothing
but death.</p>
                     <p>7. If thou didſt ſee thy ſelfe loſt and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs,
ſo as not any thing could ſatisfie thee
but Chriſt, this is a great and ſweet worke of

                        </gap> I feare my faith is not the faith of
Gods Elect, becauſe I have ſo many doubtings.</p>
                     <p>1. I grant feares and doubtings are the
fruits of unbeliefe: and as feares and doubts
increaſe, the ſtronger unbeliefe is, yet by the
Scriptures it appeares, Gods people that have
beleeved, yet had many doubts and feares, as
appeares <hi>Joh. 13. 1. Mark</hi> 9. 24. Unbeliefe
was ſo ſtrong in <hi>Thomas,</hi> that he ſaid <hi>he would

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:152344:154"/>
and light, darkneſſe, and one of the fruits of

                     <p>2. Uſe meanes to remove ſuch things as
ſtrengthen unbeliefe, and hinder the ſight of
thy faith: ignorance is one cauſe of doubting;
alſo an over-ſenſibleneſſe of infirmities, ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Gods meanes, neglect of duty, or formall

Know that means are means, not cauſes of the

                     <p>3. Indeavour to ſtrengthen thy faith; know
the happineſſe of a beleever in Chriſt; ſeed
thy faith with ſutable promiſes; live upon
Chriſt above; pray in faith; <hi>Aske his Spirit,
and thou ſhalt have it,</hi> ſee <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 23. Which
will revive and fill thy ſoule with joy and
peace in beleeving; in the ſame meaſure God

doubts and feares are caſt out; <hi>Perfect

                     </p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Diſ.</hi> I feare my faith is preſumption.</p>
                     <p>Preſumption may be underſtood in a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
conſideration: firſt, for a confidence
without the Word; or, ſecondly, againſt the
Word: for the firſt:</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="296" facs="tcp:152344:155"/>
1. He that preſumes he hath no ground for
his confidence, he can neither give you any
Scripture, or good reaſon for his confidence;
the ground of his confidence is his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
and not from the Word and promiſe of
God; but he that beleeves in Chriſt, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
is in the Word; <hi>We through the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
have hope,</hi> Rom. 15. 4. No hope without
a word; <hi>In his word doe I hope,</hi> Pſal. 130. 5.
<hi>But I hope in thy Word</hi> Pſal. 119. 81.</p>
                     <p>He that beleeves in Chriſt, receives no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of life, but in, and through Chriſt, in the
riches of his grace: but</p>
                     <p>2. He that preſumes, if he receive a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
he receives it upon his own qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
without reſpect to Chriſt: he gathers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
of life from what he is, and what he
can doe: <hi>his</hi> own <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> was never
<hi>droſſe and dung</hi> to him, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. So they
depend upon their faith, and not upon Chriſt;
the cauſe of their confidence is, becauſe they
are ſo good, and not ſo bad; like the proud
Phariſee, he never received the ſentence of
death in himſelfe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9. And as they
were ever confident, ſo it was ever eaſie for
them to beleeve.</p>
                     <p>He that beleeves, his hope and truſt is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in God; they hope in his mercy; <hi>The eyes
of the Lord are upon them that hope in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
Pſal. 33. 18. 21. 22. It is Gods worke to
perſwade the heart to reſt upon the free mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:152344:155"/>
of God in Chriſt, <hi>Pſal. 13. 5. I truſt in the
mercy of God for ever and ever,</hi> Pſal. 52. 8.
<hi>With the Lord there is mercy,</hi> Pſal. 130. 7. <hi>God
is rich in mercy.</hi> Eph. 2. 4. Preſumption can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
doe ſo, <hi>Joh. 12. 37. 1 Pet. 19. 20. John</hi>
6. 28, 29.</p>
                     <p>Alſo his confidence is contrary to the word
of God, the word of God proteſts againſt
them, and their confidence; as appeares <hi>Jer.</hi>
9. 9. 15. So their preſumption hardens them
and imboldens them to venture upon ſinfull
practices, as lying, ſtealing, drunkenneſſe,
ſwearing, uncleanneſſe, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>He that truly beleeves, <hi>abhorres that which
is evill,</hi> and <hi>cleaves to that which is good,</hi>
Rom. 12. 9. <hi>Every man that hath this hope in
him purifieth himſelfe as he is pure,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.
3. ſee <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 11, 12. They count all things
but loſſe for Chriſt; for him they will <hi>ſuffer
the loſſe of all things,</hi> Phil. 3. 8. Thoſe who
have taſted of Gods free love, admire it, are
thankfull for it, and doe loath with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
indignation what ſoever ſhall intrench up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the free love of God, although it were but
in the leaſt degree.</p>

between a <hi>babe in Chriſt.</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 1.
and <hi>a man in Chriſt,</hi> ſee 1 Joh. 2. 12, 13. Alſo
conſider, are you a babe in the wombe, or
borne, he is <hi>a babe that is unskilfull in the
word of Righteouſneſſe,</hi> ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 13. As a
childe is begotten and alive, its in the wombe
before it be borne, ſo a ſoule may be alive,
begotten from above, before it be borne;
Chriſt muſt be <hi>formed in us, before we can be
new-borne babes,</hi> Gal. 4. 18. 1 Pet. 2. 2. When
thou art delivered out of bondage, darkneſſe,
and feares, concerning thy ſoule, thou art
borne and brought forth: for as the wombe
is a place of bondage, ſo is a doubting condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and therefore ſuch cannot do that which
others doe. Alſo in caſe thou art new borne,
there cannot be that expected from thee as
from a man in Chriſt; you know there is a
difference to be put between a childe and a
man.</p>
                     <p>2. Learne to diſtinguiſh between the fruits
of the Spirits, and the exerciſe of them; its
not the having of the fruits of the Spirit, but
the exerciſe of them that attaines to a holy
converſation.</p>
                     <p>3. Know that the time of doubting is a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
time; men cannot fight and work at one
and the ſame time; when a ſoule is delivered
from its enemies, Satans terrors then the ſoule
begins to ſerve; <hi>Being delivered we ſerve,</hi> Luk.
1. 47. Yee ſee deliverance is before working,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:152344:156"/>
therefore the time of doubting, of bondage,
is not the ſeaſon of growing in holy ſervices.</p>
                     <p>4. Know, its one thing to be the Lords, and
another thing for God to convey his power
into the ſoule, by which its made conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the will of Chriſt, and <hi>lives by faith in
the Son of God,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. The firſt is where
the latter is not.</p>

1. Theſe thoughts are from Satan, they are
contrary to the word of the Lord, which ſaith,
<hi>Caſt not away your confidence,</hi> Heb. 10. 35.</p>
                     <p>2. If you would conſider from whence ſuch
thoughts ariſe, it would appeare to be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
and not according to the word, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe
commonly becauſe a man is ſo indiſpoſed
to doe good, in that he is no more ſpirituall;
theſe indeed declare there is much corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

to be a ſonne and daughter of God; one ſonne
is more wilfull and ſtubborne then another,
yet he is a ſonne for all that, though a bad
one.</p>
                     <p>3. Satan tempts Chriſts babes to caſt away
their confidence in God; its no wonder he
will tell them they have no faith, &amp;c. Satan
may be anſwered, that he knowes not; alſo if
I ſhould thinke ſo, I may be deceived; for as
fire raked up in aſhes appeares not, nor gives
it any light or heate, ſo corruption may hide
and obſcure faith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 1. The ſoule may
ſay to Satan, if I have no faith, why doe yee
not let me alone, as yee do others, and as yee
did me when I tooke my fill of ſinne, then yee
told me I had faith when I had none, I have
found yee a lier, and therefore I will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
you, and am the more confident I have
faith, becauſe yee ſay, I have none; for <hi>you
are a lier, and the father of it,</hi> Joh. 8. 44. But

<hi>Which in times paſt were not a people, but are

deſpaire will do me no good, its better in the
uſe of meanes to waite upon God, and truſt
him with my ſoule; if mercy appeare, I ſhall
praiſe him, and it may come, there is nothing
too hard for God; <hi>Lord, if thou wilt, thou canſt

                     <p>1. Unbeliefe deads thy heart, and hinders
thy living upon Chriſts ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>2. Its ſo with thee that thou maiſt ſee a
need of Chriſts ſtrength, and goe to him by
faith for it.</p>
                     <p>3. If God hath given thee a deſire to obey
him, ſay not that it is nothing, God ſaith its

The ſtrongeſt Saint is but weake, the higheſt

4. God may for ends beſt knowne to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
ſuffer corruption to be too ſtrong for
thee, it may be, to abaſe thee more in thy own

perſonall Sanctification the more imperfect,
that wee might the more minde and behold
Jeſus Chriſt, and our Righteouſneſſe in him,
and live the more upon him, and joy the more
in our Juſtification by him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6, 7.</p>

9. Diſ. What I once felt is now decayed.</p>
                     <p>1. The ground of our faith is God in his

ſenſuall; <hi>Wee live not by ſight, but by faith,</hi>
2 Cor. 5. 7.</p>
                     <p>2. Whilſt thou maintaineſt feares and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies
of Gods love to thee, its no wonder it

as, Pſal. 77. <hi>With him there is no variableneſſe,
nor ſhadow of turning,</hi> Jam. 1. 17. <hi>Whom he loves
he loves for ever,</hi> Joh. 13. 1.</p>
                     <p>3. A childe of God may decay in parts, ſight,
feelings, and exerciſe of faith, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 10.
theſe are ſometimes more, &amp; ſometimes leſſe,
as God ſeeth beſt, that ſo wee might reſt and
relie upon Chriſt alone; I ſee and feele no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in my ſelfe, or all is as nothing to me to
Jeſus Chriſt, who is all to me.</p>
                     <p>4. We ought to beleeve that we neither ſee
nor feele; <hi>ſaith is the evidence of things not
ſeene,</hi> Heb. 11. 1. To live by faith, is to walke
after the Spirit; and to live by ſight and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
is <hi>to live after the fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8. 1, 2.</p>
                     <p>10. <hi>Diſ.</hi> I am diſcouraged, becauſe nothing, is
made good to me, I doe not poſſeſſe is.</p>
                     <p>1. If thou beeſt included, and art under
the promiſe of it, thou ſhalt poſſeſſe it.</p>
                     <p>2. It may be made good to thee without
thy poſſeſſion of it, there is neither faith, nor
hope in what we poſſeſſe; to have right in it,
and to poſſeſſe it, are two things; <hi>They dyed in
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:152344:160"/>
faith,</hi> they did not <hi>poſſeſſe what they beleeved,</hi>
Heb. 11. 17, 18. <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeved he ſhould
have a Sonne; here was his faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 3.
17, 18. yet then he did not poſſeſſe his Sonne
to make injoyment eſſentiall to faith, is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great miſ-take.</p>
                     <p>11. <hi>Diſ.</hi> I have no aſſurance of ſalvation,
and therefore have no faith.</p>
                     <p>1 Faith and aſſurance are two diſtinct
things; aſſurance cannot be without faith, but
faith may be without aſſurance; for aſſurance
is not the proper act of faith, but an effect of
it, and a higher meaſure then that is; and the
greater our feelings of aſſurance are, the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
is our faith.</p>
                     <p>2. Faith is an aſſenting or cleaving to the
truth and faithfulneſſe of God in his promiſe,
not from any thing the ſoule ſeeth or feeleth
in it ſelfe, but from ſomething it apprehends
in God in his Word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 20, 21, 22. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
faith is attended with much ſtrife and
ſtrugling; for Satan ſaith to the ſoule, its in
vaine to beleeve. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Come, I will
eaſe thee;</hi> now for the ſoule to reſt upon the
ability and fidelity of Chriſt in his promiſe, is
no ſmall meaſure of faith.</p>
                     <p>Aſſurance is not from the nature of faith,
nor from the direct act of faith, but from the
reflect act of faith, which is for a man to ſee
and know that he beleeves; which aſſurance
is from the light and teſtimony of the Spirit
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:152344:160"/>
of God in the conſcience of one that is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
a beleever, cauſing the ſoule to know it
beleeves; the <hi>Spirit it ſelfe beareth witneſſe to
our ſpirits, that wee are the children of God,</hi>
Rom. 8. 16.</p>
                     <p>3. There be ſome that have faith by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of their ignorance and unskilfulneſſe, as
<hi>Heb. 5. 14, 15. &amp; 10. 15. Babes are unskilfull,</hi>
and have not experience of Gods dealing
with his for order and manner; ſo that when
faith doth not act, and when Chriſt doth not
clearly appeare in the ſoule, he doubts whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be not deceived; but when the Lord
appeares againe, the doubt is diſſolved, and
the ſoule ſatisfied, and he is armed with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
againſt ſuch a time, if he be able to
judge, and neglect not to marke well, but
where uſe and exerciſe is wanting, there is
not ſo cleare a diſcerning, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 11, 12.</p>
                     <p>12. <hi>Diſ.</hi> I feare the oppoſition in me is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

                     <p>I grant all the combates in men are not
right, many are deceived herein, yet the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
may be diſcerned; as,</p>
                     <p>1. The naturall conſcience, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned,

3. Conſcience inlightned, ſtrikes onely at
the branches of ſin, but not at the roote.</p>
                     <p>4. It ſets one faculty againſt another, as
the will and affections againſt the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
                     <p>1. But the Spirit of Chriſt cauſeth an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
in the ſame faculty, as in the will, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>2. The Spirit of God makes a free, full, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
impartiall reſiſtance againſt all ſin.</p>
                     <p>3. And diſcovers to the ſoule her ſecret
corruptions in their colours; the Spirit over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powereth
the ſoule, cauſing it to hate ſin, and
leave it.</p>
                     <p>4. The Spirit cauſeth the ſoule to be more
glad, the more ſin is diſcovered.</p>
                     <p>5. The Spirit of God teacheth the ſoule to
oppoſe all ſin, even the appearance of evill,
equally, proportionably, and orderly.</p>
                     <p>6. The Spirit cauſeth the ſoule not to turne
the truth of God into incouragements to ſin,
as ſome doe.</p>

                     <p>1. There is much hardneſſe of heart in a
childe of God, they feele it, and mourne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it, and complaine of it, this is the frame
of a new heart.</p>
                     <p>2. To feele hardneſſe is from ſoftneſſe, and
the condition of an experienced childe of
God; <hi>O Lord, why haſt thou made us to erre
from thy wayes, and hardened our hearts from
thy feare; doubtleſſe, thou art our Father; thou,
O Lord, art our Father.</hi> Their hearts were har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened,
yet they were the children of God,
<hi>Iſa. 63. 16, 17. Let not the Eunuch ſay, Behold,
I am a dry tree,</hi> Iſa. 56. 3. I conſider my ſelfe
as I am in Chriſt, and one with him; what is
his is mine; Chriſts fruitfulneſſe is ours. I have
ſinne, my glory and rejoycing is, that its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given,

given us victory by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. and
fetch we our comfort from him, &amp; not from
what we finde and feele in our ſelves. About
twelve yeares agoe in the viewing of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
in prayer, in conſidering with what faith,
ſenſibleneſſe, earneſtneſſe, &amp;c. I had prayed,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:152344:167"/>
I concluded, that if I had had the Spirit of
God, I ſhould not have ſo prayed as I did,
then I concluded, that I had been fourteene
yeares or more miſ-taken; then I concluded
that if God had intended me good, he would
have manifeſted it to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e before this time,
then was I as fully ſatisfied as ever I was ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
of any thing in the world, that I ſhould
never be ſaved; I thought my condition was
very miſerable; but in this extremity I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
no remedy in this condition, till an
interpreter, one of a thouſand, did by the
truth convince me, that I did beleeve, and
ſhould be ſaved; and I was forced to confeſſe
that he that did deſire to beleeve, did beleeve;
yet I was not fully ſetled till I did ſee that my
ſalvation was effected by Chriſt on the Croſſe,
&amp;c. But that which is to be conſidered here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
is, into what a condition of deſpaire we are
like to be led in, if we judge of our eternall
conditions, and of Gods love to us by the
hardneſſe of our hearts &amp; by what we ſee and
feele in our ſelves. Although many yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I had the aſſurance of the love of God,
and was filled with joy and peace in belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
yet ſee what it is to give way to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe
in us: Let this experience be a warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to you that yee doe not as I did, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
remember that we are to beleeve that
which is contrary to that which we ſee and
feele; its ſenſe and not faith to beleeve that
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:152344:168"/>
which we ſee and feele, if one may be in this
condition one day, then two dayes, and then
two ſeven yeares; it is as God pleaſes, ſooner
or later; <hi>He heales the broken in heart, and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
up their wounds,</hi> Pſal. 147. 3.</p>

nor is there any precept or command

3. 36. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. 40.</p>

                     <p>The conſideration of theſe Scriptures are
very neceſſary, profitable, and comfortable;
theſe Scriptures declare, that what God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
he effecteth; all things are as he pleaſeth
to order them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Job</hi> ſeeing of God in all his croſſes, was pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
content, and thankfull; <hi>The Lord hath
given, and the Lord hath taken, bleſſed be the Name
of the Lord:</hi> He knew men could doe neither
more nor leſſe then God will: it was God that
did it.</p>

                        <pb n="331" facs="tcp:152344:172"/>
A cauſe of that great care and over-thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
of heart in fearing men, and want, is,
becauſe wee ſee not all things to be ordered
by God; wee are more like heathen Gentiles,
as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. Wee have need to
minde that Chapter more, to be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and to live by faith, and to be thankfull
to God, which we cannot be untill we ſee its
ſent from God; its a gift of love, whether it
be bitter or ſweet, it ſhall doe me good, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
34. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 10.</p>
                     <p>All our care, and diſlike, &amp;c. cannot alter
what God will doe; it might cauſe men to be
content: <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>He is in one minde, and who
can turne him?</hi> and <hi>what his ſoule deſireth, even
that he doth; for he performeth the thing that is
appointed for me;</hi> and <hi>many ſuch things are with
him,</hi> Job 23. 13, 14. As if he ſhould ſay, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
helpe it, God will have it ſo, I may uſe the
meanes, but I muſt waite upon him, both for
the time, and manner of my deliverance;
<hi>Man diſquiets himſelfe in vaine,</hi> becauſe he doth
not ſee and minde the providence of God in
the ordering of all things; and ſo are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with our conditions, nor beare croſſes
patiently.</p>
                     <p>If thou art loſt and fatherleſſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 10.
<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 3. Chriſt is precious to thee, and thou
art precious to him; Oh know, Chriſt came
to ſeeke and ſave you, and that you ſhall injoy
life and glory by him. God is at peace with
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:152344:173"/>
you, he hath loving kindneſſe for you, that is
better then life; loe all is yours, for God is
yours, and that for ever: what can be more
ſutable, pleaſant, profitable, and delightfull,
better or more deſireable? Oh the fulneſſe,
ſweetneſſe, gloriouſneſſe of this peace, it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
knowledge: if thou art nothing in thy
own eyes, thou haſt a right in it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mayſt apply it, and be raviſhed with it.</p>
                     <p>Conſider what I have ſaid, what God hath
given thee, ſent unto thee, and put into thy
hand, even his rareſt &amp; choiſeſt dainties from
his banquetting-houſe, &amp; flaggons of his moſt
excellent and richeſt wine, full of ſpirit and
life, one taſte is able to cheare and revive thy
heart, yea raiſe and raviſh thy fainting ſoule
with love into love; Oh here is enough, Chriſts
dainties are durable, his fountaine is bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
and infinite, it cannot be exhauſted or
drawne dry, therefore eate O friends, and
drinke abundantly. To be comforted and
ſtrengthened with it, if God pleaſe to bleſſe it
to thee, it will be ſweet and profitable; inſtead
of darkneſſe light ſhall ſhine clearly, ſweetly,
pleaſantly, if the Lord cauſe thy ſoule to be
this light, &amp; love to live in it, &amp; be overpowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

with thankfuleſſe and ioy; as ſome have
done; he creates the fruit of the lips, peace; if

and that thy joy may be full.</p>

and the ſufficiency of his Sacrifice to ſave,
is the main thing I contend for againſt
the Papiſts, who ſay, <hi>Chriſts ſacrifice is
not ſufficient without their ſacrifice;
Charity ſaves,</hi> ſaith one; <hi>without good
workes, no ſalvation,</hi> ſaith another;
a third ſaith; <hi>that Chriſts ſacrifice is
not ſufficient for our Salvation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
beleeving; that beleeving ſaves;
and that without beleeving we cannot
be ſaved:</hi> Yee ſee, they all urge a neceſſity
<pb facs="tcp:152344:176"/>
of ſomething for ſalvation, beſides Chriſts
Sacrifice, without which ſomething, they
ſay, we cannot be ſaved; ſo that they de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y
the ſufficiency of Chriſts ſacrifice to ſave,
and ſo deny that Chriſt doth ſave; for thoſe
that he ſaves, he ſaves by his ſacrifice:
Alſo if Chriſt and ſomething elſe ſaves us,
Chriſt ſaves us not; for he is no Saviour,
if he be but a part of a Saviour; therefore
in adding ſomething to Chriſts ſacrifice,
they deny the ſufficiency of Chriſts ſacrifice;
ſo that their opinions are diſhonourable to
Chriſt; therefore as we tender the honour
of Jeſus Chriſt, we are to hate and abhorre
them, being enemies to the Croſſe of Chriſt,
and therefore abominable.</p>
                  <p>If we conſider how generally theſe are
received, and ſcarce contradicted by any,
that beleeving, and Chriſt and beleeving
together ſaves us: ſure it ſhould greatly
ſtirre us up, and provoke us to contend for
the ſufficiency of Chriſts ſacrifice, though
our contending ſhould coſt us our lives.</p>
                  <p>There is no truth more honourable to
Chriſt, nor of greater conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

glory, and our ſalvation, then this is; take
away any thing of the ſufficiency of Chriſts
ſacrifice, and our ſalvation is deſtroyed;
what a diſhonour were it to God to ſend
Chriſt to ſave us, and yet for him not to
ſave, and not to be ſufficient to ſave: there
is no opinion in the world, that my ſoule
doth more abhorre, nor againſt which I
would more freely lay downe my life for
then this.</p>
                  <p>This Treatiſe tends to exalt Chriſt alone,
ſelfe is not exalted, nor nothing of man;
this doctrine puts a man upon a whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
of himſelfe, becauſe man and his beſt
works are not onely wholy ſhut out in this
worke, but trampled upon in reſpect of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
and Salvation: This doctrine
ſtrips us naked from all things elſe but
Chriſt, it is not I and my workes, nor
Chriſt and my workes together that ſaves
me, but Jeſus Chriſt alone is he that ſaves
us from our ſinnes, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Many want this light: deſire and hope
of doing good, moved and incouraged me
to take paines herein, and ſend it into the

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:152344:182"/>
Chriſt, then no ſin from the beginning to the
end of the world ſhall ever be taken away,
but what he then tooke away by his death;
but nothing elſe but Chriſts death could take
away ſin; <hi>the bloud of Buls and Goats could never
take away ſin;</hi> the Prieſts by <hi>all their offerings</hi>
could never take away ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 11. Our
prayers, teares, nor any worke of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
we could doe, could not doe it, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.
5. Chriſts beleeving could not doe it (much
leſſe our beleeving) if it could, why did he
dye? <hi>He tooke away ſin by the ſacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,</hi>
Heb. 9. 20. <hi>The offering of the body of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>
tooke it away <hi>once for all,</hi> Heb. 9. 15. 26.
<hi>&amp; 10. 17, 18. 1 Joh.</hi> 1. 7. Our ſins were too
<hi>heavy a burden for us</hi> to beare, <hi>Pſal. 38. 4. He
was mighty to ſave,</hi> therefore able to beare
them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 19. Therefore the Lord was
<hi>pleaſed to lay on him the iniquitie of us all,</hi> yea the
puniſhment of them all was laid upon Chriſt,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 6. and ſo ſaved us from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them; therefore Chriſt is called <hi>the
Author of ſalvation,</hi> Heb. 5. 9. becauſe he is the
author of our freedome from the puniſhment
of ſin, and the meanes of ſalvation <hi>through</hi> or
<hi>by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> becauſe it was through him
and by him effected, <hi>Eph. 1. 7. Col.</hi> 1. 14.
<hi>Mat. 1. 21. He came into the world to ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi>
1 Tim. 1. 15. Therefore when he was
in the world he did ſave his from their ſinnes,
elſe he loſt the end of his coming. He is called
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:152344:183"/>
                        <hi>Salvation it ſelfe,</hi> Iſa. 49. 6. Becauſe he alone
hath ſaved us without us; without our belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
or workes he hath fully and wholly ſaved
us; he is no halfe Saviour; he ſaith, <hi>My own
arme hath brought ſalvation,</hi> Iſa. 63. Therefore
its not now to bring, becauſe he hath ſaved us
from the puniſhment of ſinne; for <hi>he bore our
ſinnes, and carried them away,</hi> Iſa 53. 4, 5. with
<hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 21. If he had not then freed us from
the puniſhment of ſin, Chriſt had not excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Prieſts under the law and their offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
but had bin as very a <hi>ſhadow</hi> as they were

been taking away ſinne this ſixteene hundred
yeares, and yet this worke is ſtill to doe; this
is contrary to <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. 9. Say ſome, can ſin be
taken away, and in us too? I anſwer; yes; in

are free from ſin; they have ſin, 1 <hi>Joh</hi> 1 8. 10.
they are charged with ſin, <hi>Jam. 5. 17. Gal.</hi> 2.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:152344:183"/>
to free us from the puniſhment of ſinne,
and his righteouſneſſe is ours, then wee are
freed from the puniſhment of ſinne: but
Chriſts righteouſneſſe is ſufficient, as appeares
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. Chriſt is ours, therefore his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
is ours; for they are inſeparable:
<hi>This is his name that they ſhall call him the Lord
[our] Righteouſneſſe,</hi> Jer. 23. 6. Therefore
neither beleeving, nor our works, cannot free
us from the puniſhment of ſinne.</p>
                     <p>6 <hi>Argu.</hi> Thoſe that are without fault, they
are not liable to any puniſhment of ſinne; but
we are ſo; <hi>for they are without fault before the
throne of God,</hi> Rev. 14. 5. Its an act of Injuſtice
to charge one to be guilty of that which he is
free of, but more unjuſt to puniſh him; he
that is free from ſin, is an innocent man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fault, ought not to be puniſhed.</p>

20. To be without fault, to be holy, juſt and
righteous, to be perfect, and to be free from

                     <p>7 <hi>Argu.</hi> Thoſe that are freed from ſinne,
they are freed from the puniſhment of ſinne;
but we are freed from ſin, <hi>Rom. 6. 7 &amp;</hi> 7. 6,
7, 8. <hi>We are freed from the law of ſin and death,</hi>
Rom. 8. 2. Therefore wee are freed from the
puniſhment of ſin, elſe how are we freed, and
from what: Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Loe I come to doe thy

10. 5. 4. <hi>Chriſt made me free,</hi> Gal. 5. 1. His
death paid for the freedome I now injoy,
<hi>Rom</hi> 7. 24, 25. Wee are called Saints, holy,
&amp;c. But if wee were not freed from ſin, how
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:152344:184"/>
are <hi>we holy?</hi> what kinde of Saints are wee?
That which freeth us from ſin, is not in me,
but ſomething <hi>in him,</hi> Rom. 8. 2.</p>
                     <p>8 <hi>Argu.</hi> If Chriſt hath purged away our
ſins, then they are gone, wee are freed from
them, from the puniſhment of ſin; but Chriſt
hath purged our ſins away; <hi>He by himſelfe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
our ſins,</hi> Heb. 1. 3. <hi>As for our iniquities, thou
ſhalt purge them away,</hi> Pſal. 65. 3. When he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by his death he fulfilled this prophecie,
to purge away ſin, <hi>viz.</hi> the puniſhment of ſin,
therefore he hath freed us from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſie.</p>
                     <p>9 <hi>Argu.</hi> If our ſins cannot be found, then
they cannot be laid to our charge; but they
cannot be found; <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
of Iſrael ſhall be ſought for, and there ſhall
be none, and the ſins of Judah, and they ſhall not
be found,</hi> Jer. 50. 20. Therefore we are freed
from the puniſhment of ſin.</p>
                     <p>10 <hi>Argu.</hi> If we are not in our ſins, then we
are juſt and righteous; but we are not in our
ſins, becauſe <hi>Chriſt is riſen:</hi> To ſay wee are in
our ſins, is to deny Chriſt to be riſen, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 15.
17. w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is to deny him to be <hi>the Chriſt the Son

<hi>Mat. 20. 19. &amp; 16. 21. Joh 18. 32 Acts</hi> 2. 25.
<hi>&amp;</hi> 24. 24. He tooke away ſin by the ſacrifice
of himſelfe, therefore we are not liable to the
puniſhment of ſin.</p>
                     <p>11. <hi>Argu.</hi> If not any thing can be laid to the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:152344:185"/>
charge of Gods Elect, then they are not lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to any puniſhment of ſinne; but not <hi>any
thing can be laid to the charge of Gods Elect,</hi> Rom.
8. 33. To be free from ſin, and to be free
from charge, and to be freed from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſin, is one thing; they that are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by his bloud, they are juſtified from all
ſin, and therefore ſtand not chargeable to him
for any ſin. So that ever ſince the Elect were
reconciled to God by Jeſus Chriſt, their ſinnes
were never imputed to them, as appeares
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18, 19. They have ſinne, but its not
imputed.</p>
                     <p>12 <hi>Argu.</hi> If Chriſt hath delivered us from
the curſe, then wee are not liable to the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment
of ſin, for the curſe and puniſhment
of ſin is one thing, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. But we are <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from the curſe,</hi> Gal. 3. 13, 14. No curſe
can come nigh our dwelling place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.
10. Chriſts ſuffering for us, is as ſufficient for
us as if we had ſuffered for us in our own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
he by it had made a full and perfect ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction:
therefore wee are freed from the
puniſhment of ſin.</p>
                     <p>13 <hi>Argu.</hi> If there be no condemnation to
them that are in Chriſt, then there is no pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment
due to them; for puniſhment and
condemnation are one thing; <hi>but there is no
condemnation to us,</hi> Rom. 8. 1. with <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4.
Therefore we are freed, &amp;c. for <hi>our ſins are not
imputed to us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 19. Rom. 4. 8. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:152344:185"/>
wee are not liable to any condemnation
for them.</p>
                     <p>14 <hi>Argu.</hi> If Chriſt hath delivered us from the
wrath to come, then we are not liable to any
puniſhment of ſin; for wrath and puniſhment
are one, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 4. But Chriſt is he <hi>who hath
delivered us from the wrath to come,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1.
10. If it be ſo, then we are not liable to any,
then we have no cauſe to feare any puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to come, becauſe to us there is none to
come.</p>
                     <p>15 <hi>Argu.</hi> If that which was againſt us was
nailed to his Croſſe, then the puniſhment of
our ſins was nailed to his Croſſe, for that and
nothing but that was againſt us; but <hi>that which
was againſt us was nailed to his Croſſe,</hi> Col. 2. 14.
Therefore never ſince his death there hath
not been any thing againſt us. When I looke
into the booke of Juſtice, I ſee all is paid,
croſſed, cancelled; before God we were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
and ſet free by Chriſt, and are ever ſo,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14.</p>
                     <p>16 <hi>Argu.</hi> If our peace and reconciliation
was made by the bloud of his Croſſe, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſince his death our peace and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hath been made; but <hi>our peace and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
was made by the bloud of his Croſſe,</hi> Col.
1. 20, 21, 22. If Chriſt hath made our peace
for us, we cannot make our peace with God;
Chriſt <hi>he is our peace,</hi> Eph. 2. 14. If he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we were, our peace was before we were.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:152344:186"/>
Therefore we are freed from the puniſhment
of ſinne.</p>
                     <p>17 <hi>Argu.</hi> If our ſins are blotted out, then
they are not chargeable; but <hi>they are blotted
out,</hi> Iſa. 44. 22, 23. Therefore wee are freed
from the puniſhment of ſin.</p>
                     <p>18 <hi>Argu.</hi> If the enmity that was againſt us
be flaine &amp; aboliſhed, then we are freed from
it; <hi>but the enmity that was againſt us was ſlaine
and aboliſhed in his fleſh,</hi> Eph. 2. 15, 16. Col. 1.
20. Therefore ever ſince his death it hath
been aboliſhed: the enmity that was againſt
us is nothing elſe but the curſe, wrath, which
is the puniſhment of ſin, if it be ſlaine it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
hurt us; if it be aboliſhed, it is not; wee
cannot meet with nor ſuffer by that which is
not; for that which is not, hath no beeing;
therefore we are for ever freed from the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment
of ſinne.</p>
                     <p>19. <hi>Argu.</hi> If God will not remember our

ſaith. <hi>He will not remember our ſinnes no more,</hi>
Iſa. 43. 25. Jer. 31. 34. Heb. 8. 12. God is not

the ten Commandements, called the

for if I am not tied to obſerve it, I ſin not if I
doe contrary to it, its no marvell if ſuch be
abominable in their hearts and lives: I grant
we are freed from the curſe and puniſhment
of it, but not from the things contained in it;
the Law concernes our converſation, though

                     <p>Thus I have fully proved that Chriſt upon
the Croſſe did ſuffer the whole puniſhment of

Chriſt did die in vaine, or is not a full and a

the puniſhment of ſin, he had ſaved us but in

dying for us, was to free us from all the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment

                     <p>1. There is no doctrine in Religion more
honorable to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, then this
is, this is the doctrine that gives all to Chriſt,
and exalts him alone, that God may be <hi>all in
all:</hi> this doctrine cryeth nothing but Chriſt;
for he hath done all for us, and is all unto us,
<hi>Col.</hi> 3. 11. The maine thing the Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
to know, was nothing but Chriſt, and him
crucified, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 2.</p>

2. This doctrine moſt magnifieth the free
love of God in that he hath loved us, juſtified
and ſaved us freely: many are not able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
this light, it is ſo great; as when the Sun
ſhineth in its ſtrength, weake eyes are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to beare it, onely the Eagle can behold it;
ſo none but the Eagle-eyed Chriſtians are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to behold <hi>the Sonne of Righteouſneſſe</hi> ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his glory; therefore few receive it:
the Prophet ſpeaking of this doctrine, ſaith;
<hi>Who hath beleeved our report, and to whom is the
arme of the Lord revealed,</hi> Iſa. 53. 1. So that
unleſſe the power of God cauſeth the ſoule
to ſee this truth, there is no beleeving it, men
are ignorant of the fulneſſe of the perfection
of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, therefore they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
it, &amp; goe about to eſtabliſh their own
righteouſneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. They reproach this
doctrine, (thus they ſerved Chriſt, and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
ſee <hi>Luk. 23. 13, 14. Joh. 17. 12. &amp;</hi> 10.
20. 23. <hi>Jer.</hi> 20. 8, 9.) and darken this truth,
inſtead of clearing it: over-confidence of mens
knowing truth, foreſtalls and deceives many,
and keeps them from the truth.</p>
                     <p>3. This doctrine moſt abaſeth man, in that
he hath not, nor could not doe any thing in
the world to procure theſe things, I deſerved
it not, nor procured it not, nor had any hand
in the doing of it; God will have it ſo, <hi>that no
fleſh ſhould glory,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 29. That God may
be all, and man nothing: <hi>I be nothing,</hi> 1 Cor.

                     <p>7. This is the doctrine that will hold when

                     <p>8. This is the doctrine that holds up the

life is hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> Col. 3. 3, 4. The

what more canſt thou require of me? O the
<hi>unſearchable riches of Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 3. 8.</p>

no more, no more; oh what a fountaine of

is like to this, if my ſoule be deſerted, &amp; faith
faile, yet God is my God, I change oft, but he
never; when I cannot apprehend him, I am

our ſoules from fainting in a world of miſery
and trouble.</p>
                     <p>Seeing the Lord hath cauſed us to know

                     <p>IN which <hi>T. G.</hi> endeavoureth to maintaine,
that our Juſtification it ſelfe was not at
Chriſts death, but at, and by his Reſurrection;
Secondly, that the worke of our Salvation is
not yet effected, but Chriſt is a doing of it by
his Interceſſion, &amp;c. I thought it neceſſary for

juſtified by his bloud) to remove theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
by giving a briefe Anſwer to what he

                        <hi>T. G.</hi> Yea rather that is riſen againe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.
34. Rather compared to his death. The Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of Chriſt ſerved for a double uſe and end;
as an evidence to our faith, that God is fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:152344:197"/>
by Chriſts death; Secondly, It had as great
an influence into our Juſtification as his death had,
in both reſpects it deſerves rather to be put upon it,
<hi>Pag. 65. &amp;</hi> 102, 103.</p>
                     <p>Anſ. Its <hi>Chriſt that dyed, yea rather that is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
againe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 34. The ſcope of the
Apoſtle here in his triumph in Chriſts death
gives us to underſtand the viſible ground and
cauſe of triumph, and that was rather in the
Reſurrection of Chriſt, then in his death; for
that did more declare him to be the Sonne of
God, then his death did; for any one might be
crucified, and dye; but no falſe Chriſt could
riſe againe: and had be not riſen, he had not
been the true Chriſt; and if he had not riſen,
they could not be aſſured that he was the Son
of God, who onely could take away ſinne;
therefore Chriſts Reſurrection declared theſe
things: Firſt, That he was the Son of God;
<hi>Declared to be the Son of God with power by the
Reſurrection from the dead,</hi> Eph. 1. 4. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
It declared he had <hi>taken away ſin by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of himſelfe, and we are not in our ſinnes,</hi> ſee
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 1. 4. 5. 17. Thirdly, It declared that
thoſe who witneſſed Chriſt to be the Sonne of
God, &amp;c. that they declared the truth, and ſo
juſtified them to be true witneſſes: therefore
the Apoſtle ſaith; <hi>If Chriſt be not riſen, we are
found falſe witneſſes,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 14, 15. <hi>He roſe
againe for our juſtification,</hi> Rom. 4. 24. Before
men Chriſts reſurrection juſtified us in decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:152344:198"/>
him to be the Sonne of God, in that wee
are true witneſſes. Fourthly, It declares to us
that we ſhall alſo riſe in due time; ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>

his death did juſtifie, that is, free the Elect
from the puniſhment of ſinne.</p>
                     <p>And that the Reſurrection of Chriſt had no
influence at all in that Juſtification which is
our freedome from ſinne; appeares by theſe
Reaſons.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>We are juſtified by his bloud,</hi> Rom. 5. 9.
His Reſurrection is not his bloud.</p>
                     <p>2. We are <hi>made righteous,</hi> that is, juſtified
<hi>by his obedience,</hi> Rom. 5. 18, 19. His Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is no part of his obedience. What Chriſt
did as God was no obedience; not the divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
but the humanity is capable of obeying;
but Chriſt raiſed himſelfe as God by his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
power, <hi>Eph</hi> 1. 19, 20, 21. ſee <hi>Joh.</hi> 10 18.
I grant his Reſurrection is neceſſary to our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
happineſſe and glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 23. &amp;c.
But its no part of his obedience, nor did it
ſave us from our ſinnes.</p>
                     <p>3. His reſurrection was no obedience to
the Law; for the Law required no more but
<hi>death,</hi> Gen. 2. 17. And therefo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a full ſatisfaction of the Law, <hi>Heb. 2. 9. Gal.</hi> 3.

                     <p>4. We were <hi>juſtified through his Redemption,</hi>
Rom. 3. 24. Therefore not through his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection:

                     <p>Concerning the Interceſſion of Chriſt, he
ſaith:</p>
                     <p>Interceſſion is an act, <hi>p.</hi> 204. In his interceſſion
he intreateth, <hi>p.</hi> 194. Its his praying for us in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<hi>p.</hi> 176. 179. 185. 189. Interceſſion is ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>p.</hi> 339. Chriſt by his own prayers ſeconds the
cry of his bloud <hi>p.</hi> 253. Jeſus ſhall intercede for
the pardon of them, <hi>p. 246. The 17. of</hi> John is a
pattern and inſtance of his interceſſion for us in
heaven, <hi>p.</hi> 24<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> The 17. of <hi>John</hi> declares Chriſt ſpake
words in his own perſon: and then the ſumme
of that you ſay, is this; That Chriſt in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
now he is glorified; ſpeaks words to God
for us, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>2. If it be ſo, then there is no perfection
in glory, for where perfection is, there needs
no words; God is perfect, ſo is Chriſt in glory,
and muſt Chriſt ſpeak words to God, that God
might know his minde, and ſo prevaile; is this
ſutable to a condition of glory, in which is
perfection?</p>
                     <p>3. Your words imply that God the Father
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:152344:200"/>
loveth us leſſe then Chriſt; that he need to be
prayed and intreated, &amp;c. But Chriſt is ſo far
from needing any to pray and intreat him,
that he prayeth and intreateth God for us;
which cannot be, becauſe <hi>they are one,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.
7. Therefore equall in love: God the Father
is ſaid to Elect us, give us to Chriſt, and ſend
Chriſt to dye for us: God is as well pleaſed
with us as Chriſt is, and he loveth us as well as
he loveth Chriſt: Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt loved
them as thou haſt loved me: thou lovedſt me before
the foundation of the world,</hi> Joh. 17. 23, 24. <hi>The
Father himſelfe loveth you,</hi> Joh 16. 26. 27. He
of himſelfe without intreaty loveth us; God
cannot love us more nor leſſe then he doth,
his love is infinite, without beginning or end;
that which is infinite, is not capable of being
greater or leſſer; and its the more glorious,
becauſe it is ſo, his knowledge cannot be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
nor leſſe then it is: the ſame may be ſaid
of his love, he never began to know, to will,
to love, they are one in God: <hi>God is love;</hi> its
his being, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 16. I can ſay in a holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
and confidence, in the ſatisfaction of
Chriſt, in admiration and thankfulneſſe; if
God can condemne me let him, <hi>he cannot deny
himſelfe:</hi> the eternity and certainty of the
Saints happy eſtate, leſſeneth not his love:
when we conceive of him in the higheſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
we can, ſtill we come ſhort, we cannot
reach it; <hi>Such knowledge is too wonderfull for</hi>
                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:152344:201"/>
me; it is ſo high I cannot attaine unto it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.

                     <p>Chriſts bloud ſpeaketh, <hi>Rev. 6. 9. Heb.</hi> 11.
4. So the bloud of ſprinkling ſpeaketh within
us better things then that of <hi>Abel,</hi> Heb. 13. 24.
It ſpeaketh peace to the conſcience.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But he ſaith;</hi> Interceſſion is a praying for us

                     <p>
                        <hi>There be many heavens,</hi> Deut. 10. 14. The

<hi>The Church is called Heaven,</hi> Rev. 12. 7.
Mat. 11. 12. <hi>The ayre is called heaven,</hi> 1
Kings 18. 45. The heaven of heavens cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
God; in him wee live, move, and have our
beeing.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Chriſt ever liveth to make interceſſion
for us, [in us</hi>] The Spirit it ſelfe maketh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
for us, <hi>Rom. 8. 26, 27. Chriſt, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and Spirit are one;</hi> The Spirit of Chriſt
which was [in them] 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11. The Lord is
that Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 17. The Spirit of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſpeaketh [in you) <hi>Mat. 10. 20. Rom.</hi> 8. 34.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Chriſt is our advocate and interceſſor, in
reſpect of that which he did for us in his own
perſon when he was upon the earth before he
ſuffered; when he</hi> poured out his ſoule unto
death, and made interceſſion for us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 12.
Holy Father, I pray that thou keep them from evill;
I pray not for theſe alone, but for them alſo which
ſhall beleeve in me. Father, I will that they which
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:152344:201"/>
thou haſt given me may be with me where I am,
that they may behold my glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Joh. 17. 9. 11.
15. 19. <hi>to</hi> 26.</p>
                     <p>4. Chriſts interceſſion holds forth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation
of the efficacy of the vertue and
fruit of Chriſts ſacrifice, that it doth for ever
remaine in force a full ſatisfaction for all the
ſinnes of the Elect. This is very ſweet, and
full of divine conſolation, to ſatisfie the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
ſoule, which is the maine thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by ſuch expreſſions: it is a figurative
ſpeech, as the Scripture aſcribes to God, eyes,
hand, arme: the Anthropomorphites conclude
that God the Father hath a body, with eyes
like unto us: So the Papiſts picture him to be
an old man, &amp;c. If one ſhould ſay, God is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of forgetfulneſſe, becauſe he ſaith, <hi>he
will remember our ſinnes no more.</hi> Theſe conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
are unreaſonable, and ſo is your poſition
that Chriſt ſpeakes words now in his perſon,
&amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But he ſaith;</hi> Chriſt doth as much worke for us
in heaven at this inſtant, as ever he did on the
earth, <hi>p.</hi> 214.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> You confeſſe that a Surety is more
then an Interceſſor; and is it not more to dye
for one, then to ſpeake for him; if ſo, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
is not ſo much: ſee you not how you
contradict your ſelfe in your diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>ſet downe at the right hand
of God,</hi> to declare to us that his work is done;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:152344:202"/>
while the Prieſt was executing his offices, he
was to <hi>ſtand,</hi> Heb. 10. 11. Which declared that
Chriſt the ſubſtance of thoſe Prieſts, was not
to ſit untill he had finiſhed in his perſon his
offices of Prieſthood.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He ſaith;</hi> That none of his offices ſhould lie i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
he appoints this full and perpetuall worke in
heaven, that as a Prieſt by praying and interceding
God would have Chriſt never to be out of offices, or
out of worke for ever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.</p>
                     <p>

is, that he might not be out of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or out of worke, then its not becauſe of
our ſinnes.</p>
                     <p>That he doth execute any offices in his
perſon in glory, or that he doth any worke
there, is ſtill to prove; doe the Angels pray
for us, &amp;c. or are they idle o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>He ſaith;</hi> He lives but to intercede, <hi>p.</hi> 208.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Then it ſeemes after this life when all
the Saints are gloried, Chriſt muſt continue
praying and interceding for us, or elſe he muſt
ceaſe to live. I hope you will not ſay, when
we are in glory, that he ſhall need then to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede
for us: if ſo, then it ſeemes he ſhall
be out of office, or out of worke: by your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
you have run your ſelfe upon a rock,
I ſhall be glad to ſee you get off againe, I have
afforded you my helpe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He ſaith;</hi> His living to intercede, is ſaid to
keepe God and us friends, that we may never fall
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:152344:202"/>
out more, though pardoned by his death: Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
is principally intended for ſinnes after conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<hi>p.</hi> 208. God ſaies to him, now doe you looke
to them, that they and I fall out no more: not but
ſinnes after converſion are taken away by his death,
and ſinnes before it by interceſſion alſo, <hi>p.</hi> 209.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> God ſaith no ſuch thing, you vent your
vaine conceits, and father them upon God,
and ſay he ſayes ſo; I wonder at your bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
ſure you either know not what you ſay,
or thinke you may ſay any thing. When you
write againe, tell us in what place wee may
reade that God ſays ſo: it is better to ſay leſſe,
and prove more.</p>
                     <p>2. Can you tell that ever God fell out with
his Elect, and was not their friend, or that it
is poſſible for God not to love us, or not to be
a friend to us: you inſinuate both, but are
able to prove neither.</p>
                     <p>3. Tell me, what is God liable to fall out
with us for, if for ſinne, you confeſſe that is
pardoned by his death, and thoſe ſinnes after
converſion taken away by his death: to what
purpoſe is it for Chriſt to pray and intreat for
that which he knows is pardoned before; and
what hath God granted Chriſt, in granting
the pardon of that which was pardoned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?
Suppoſe I pay to one all that I owe him,
all that he can deſire and require, need I pray
and intreat him to forgive me the debt; but
if I doe, and he grant my deſire, he forgives
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:152344:203"/>
me nothing, becauſe I owe him nothing: is
not this the caſe alſo? how are our ſinnes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
if we be liable to ſuffer for them?</p>
                     <p>4. You preſent God to be a friend, but a
very uncertaine one, in that he need to have
one to be continually praying and intreating
him, to keep him friends with us, that we may
not ſuffer for that which is pardoned; hath
God pardoned us, and is he now ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
us? he ſaid, <hi>he would remember our ſinnes
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>o more.</hi> Heb. 10. 17, 18. And doth he now
remember them? You preſent God to be
changeable, who is immutable and changeth
not.</p>
                     <p>5. You preſent God to be an angry God,
yet God ſaith; <hi>Anger is not in him,</hi> Iſa. 27. 4.
How can I, or Chriſt ſay, <hi>thy will be done,</hi> if his
will be to fall out with us: it ſeemes he hath
a great will to it, if he muſt be continually
prayed and intreated to forbeare, and to be
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>acified, and not to fall out with us.</p>
                     <p>6. The Father needs no more intreating
then Chriſt doth, and that is none at all, for
theſe Reaſons.</p>
                     <p>There is no place for Interceſſion; for</p>
                     <p>1. Becauſe ſatisfaction is made for the ſinnes
of the Elect, for them it was that Chriſt ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
death: it is an act of injuſtice for to ſuffer
for that which is ſatisfied for, or to require
any thing of me, for that which before full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
hath been made.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:152344:203"/>
2. We are reconciled, therefore need none
to reconcile us; alſo his death is that which
reconciled us, therefore not his praying and
intreaty, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5 10. Before Chriſt ſuffered,
he made interceſſion; alſo there is no place for
interceſſion for that which is pardoned by his
death.</p>
                     <p>3. If <hi>Chriſts bloud clenſeth from all ſin,</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and interceſſion clenſeth us not from any
ſinne.</p>
                     <p>4. If Chriſt bleſſing his Diſciples, bleſſed
all thoſe that ſhall beleeve to the end of the
world, as you confeſſe, <hi>p.</hi> 42. and that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
of himſelfe once, made ſo full a ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
as he needed to doe it but once, <hi>p.</hi> 242.
Why may not this interceſſion when he was
upon the earth, though if it were but once, be
as effectuall to ſerve for ever, as the reſt, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when we conſider that in the 17. Of <hi>John,</hi>
Chriſt prayed for all that were given him that
ſhall beleeve. Chriſts prayer was granted,
<hi>Father, I know thou heareſt me alwayes.</hi> What
benefit have we to the end of the world by
that prayer in <hi>John</hi> 17. if it was not ſufficient
and effectuall for us; if it was ſufficient and
granted, there is no need of his continued
praying for it; if Chriſt had intended in his
perſon to pray and intreat for us now, what
needed Chriſt to have prayed for us when he
was upon the earth, ſo many hundred yeares
before we were borne, if he prayes ſo for us
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:152344:204"/>
now, would not they be ſufficient for us, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they are continually, as you ſay; if all that
Chriſt can aske, is leſſe, yea far leſſe then the
ſervice he hath done to God comes to; our
lives, pardon, ſalvation, if theſe be not enough,
but too ſmall a requitall, as you affirme, <hi>p.</hi> 244.
there is no ground, or reaſon, juſtice or equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
that Chriſt ſhould for ever aske and pray,
before he or we can have it, eſpecially if we
conſider God teacheth us to give to others
their due without a continuall asking, yea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they aske; to pay and pray comes not
freely off.</p>
                     <p>5. Becauſe <hi>the Father himſelfe loveth us,</hi> his
heart is as much for our happineſſe as Chriſts
is, therefore Chriſt need not pray to God to
love us, the reaſon is rendred by Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi>
16. 26, 27. <hi>Joh. 3. 16. Eph.</hi> 1. 3. 5. 9. 11.
The Spirit of the Lord doth not, nor need not
helpe us to make requeſts, to be loved, to be
juſtified, ſaved from the puniſhment of ſinne;
theſe things are already done, onely to know
it not, or more fully to know it, Chriſts pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<hi>John</hi> 17. is, to keepe us from evill; and we
are to pray for many things, though not to
be loved &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>6. If Chriſt by his death had fully ſatisfied
for our ſinnes, as you confeſſe, and that at
Chriſts Reſurrection, God gave Chriſt an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">

eternall life, <hi>Rom. 5. 18. p.</hi> 161. and that by
Chriſts Reſurrection our juſtification is made
irrevocable for ever, <hi>p.</hi> 103. Then there is no
need of any interceſſion, it is ſafe and ſure,
there is no danger, there needs no care or
feare, becauſe its done and paſt recalling; he
dyed as a publique perſon, he roſe as a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
perſon, and there is a formall, legall, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable
act of Juſtification of us paſſed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled
in the Court of heaven between Chriſt
and God, in his being juſtified we were juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in him; ſo that thereby our juſtification
is made paſt recalling, <hi>p.</hi> 286. If ſo, there is no
need of Chriſts praying and intreating (in his
perſon in glory) for us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He ſaith;</hi> Interceſſion is a praying for us in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
otherwiſe the ſalvation by his death were not
perfect, the performance of that part in heaven is
the perfection of it, <hi>p.</hi> 189. The vertue of his bloud
with prayers in the heavens, makes atonement by
both, <hi>p.</hi> 180. Bloud hath the loudeſt cry of all
things elſe in the eares of the Lord, as <hi>Judg.</hi> 12. 13.
<hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 10. Chriſts bloud cryeth louder then <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,</hi>

                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Then that cry is enough, and another
needleſſe, then his righteouſneſſe is enough,
and there is no need of more: you anſwer

and contradict your ſelfe, you deny the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
and perfection of Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

and ſo deny Chriſts death to be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

and ſo piece it out to make it up, but if it be

Conditions on the Covenant on mans part, to wit,
Faith and Repentance; without which, he cannot
be in the Covenant, nor have any ſhare in Jeſus

Joh. 17. 20, 21. Mat. 21. 22. Rom. 8. 9. Joh.

1 Joh. 3 9. Mat. 24. 24.</p>
                     <p>Tell me, is Election, Chriſts death, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
&amp;c. fruits of hatred or love, if of love,
then God loved the Elect before they belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
yea, before they were borne, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
                     <p>If we are <hi>choſen to life according to the good

life according to our beleeving and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
&amp;c. But the firſt is true, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 5, 6.
Therefore the latter is true alſo: nor are men
choſen to life, becauſe God foreſaw they would
beleeve God is eternall; the will of God is
God, he was never without his will; what he
now willeth, he ever did: therefore there
could not be any cauſe to goe before it, to
cauſe it to be, or ſo to be: man cannot Elect
without an act and time, but its not ſo with
an infinite being, Election is his eternall and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:152344:207"/>
immutable decree from eternitie, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11.
<hi>Eph. 1. 4. 2 Tim.</hi> 1. 9. It is the more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and glorious, that it is without beginning;
his <hi>love is everlaſting,</hi> Jer. 31. 3. Therefore
without beginning: as God is infinite without
beginning, ſo is his love; for <hi>God is love,</hi>
1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 16. ſee <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 23. Therefore God
loves his as much before they beleeve as after.
The Scripture doth not ſay, God began to
love when we began to beleeve, nor that he
loves any the better becauſe they beleeve:
it is a certain truth, that Gods love to us, is
not as ours is to him.</p>
                     <p>In that yee would have men to doe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for ſalvation, it appeares you are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the taking away of ſinne by the death
of Chriſt: hence it is that you urge our works
to be neceſſary to ſalvation; and ſo did the
Seducers, <hi>Acts 15. 5. &amp;</hi> 20. 30. If it were as
you ſay, wee are under an abſolute covenant
of works; <hi>Doe this, and live:</hi> men muſt do ſo,
and ſo ſaith the Papiſt, or elſe no ſalvation, ſo
ſay you; <hi>Though God hath promiſed, and Chriſt
purchaſed all good for beleevers, yet they ſhall not
have it, unleſſe they doe ſo,</hi> &amp;c. Doe you not ſee
how you exalt your workes above the skies,
yea, above God, and his promiſe, and the
death of Chriſt, and make workes all in all,
becauſe without them, all is fruſtrate and
comes to nothing. What, no ſhare in Chriſt,
without our workes, all is fruſtrate, if it be ſo,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:152344:208"/>
then our works are joynt Saviours with Chriſt,
chiefe Saviours: is not this pure Popery, and
the Popes Doctrine to a haire; yet it hath an
<hi>Imprimatur,</hi> J. C. is there not a cleare light of
the Goſpel in ſuch Licenſers, ſee <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 31.
<hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2. Chriſt undertook to obtaine for his,
remiſſion of ſinnes by his death, but he did
not performe it perfectly, if it be in part by
our workes; if it depends upon our workes,
then it depends not upon the death of Chriſt,
or doe you bring in Chriſt to merit, that your
workes may merit ſalvation? Moſt truly and
worthily did Doctor <hi>Criſpe</hi> contend for the
ſufficiency of Chriſts bloud to ſave us, and
you contend againſt him, and contend for the
ſufficiency of your doings in bringing in your
workes to ſalvation, and ſo undervalue the
bloud of Chriſt, therefore I contend againſt
you, our workes are imperfect, and that which
is ſo, cannot pleaſe God: if yee ſay, Chriſt
makes it up with his perfection, in adding
Chriſt to piece it out, to make it up, its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
yee make Chriſt but a piece of a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
which is the greateſt indignity yee can
offer to him.</p>
                     <p>We doe condemne the doing of any thing
for our own ſalvation; and the Reaſons why
we doe ſo are</p>
                     <p>1. We doe nothing to be ſaved, becauſe
Chriſt <hi>hath ſaved us;</hi> He <hi>came into the world to
ſave us,</hi> and he ſaved us before he aſcended,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:152344:208"/>
therefore we are not now to be ſaved <hi>from our
ſinnes,</hi> Heb. 10 10. 12. 14. 1 Tim. 1. 9. Its too
late for us to be paying the debt of our ſinnes
by our worke, the debt being paid before by
Chriſt for us; God did execute on him in his
death all the puniſhment that was due to us
for our iniquities: God doth reſt ſatisfied
in Chriſts ſatisfaction for the ſinnes of his,
paſt, preſent, and to come, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 5, 6. 11.
<hi>Heb 10 10. 14. Bleſſed he the Lord God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ael,
for he hath viſited and redeemed his people,
and hath raiſed up [an horne of ſalvation] for us
in the houſe of his ſervant David, that wee ſhould
be ſaved from our enemies,</hi> &amp;c <hi>Luk</hi> 1. 68, 69.
71. Chriſt is the horne of Salvation.</p>
                     <p>2. God requires no righteouſneſſe of us to
ſave us, becauſe Chriſt hath <hi>fulfilled all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
for us,</hi> Mat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. 15. His righteouſneſſe
ſaves us from our unrighteouſneſſe. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
of ſinne, we conſider God hath ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it Chriſts righteouſneſſe, and that in his
righteouſneſſe God is fully ſatisfied, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in it we reſt fully ſatisfied: Chriſts ſatif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
by his death, if laid in the ballance
with that perfect obedience of the law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of us, is of ſufficient weight to anſwer the
Juſtice of God: the wiſe and juſt God would
not have ordained it for that end, if it had bin
inſufficient to ſatisfie for our ſinnes; to judge
Chriſts death inſufficient, is very diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="60" facs="tcp:152344:209"/>
3. Salvation from ſin is not mans act, but
an act of Chriſt by his death, its Chriſts worke
to <hi>ſave us,</hi> Mat. 1. 21. Its not our worke to
ſave our ſelves, not our workes, but Chriſt is
the price and pay-maſter for the ſinnes of the
Elect; if wee could have ſaved our ſelves,
Chriſt needed not to come from heaven into
the world to do it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. Chriſt workes
not ſalvation in us, nor by us, but <hi>brings ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 5. Jeſus Chriſt in one worke
once performed by his death, did eternally
<hi>redeeme,</hi> Rev. 5. 9. <hi>Juſtifie,</hi> Rom. 5. 9. <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,</hi>
and <hi>perfect us for ever,</hi> Heb. 10. 10. 12. 14.
Heb. 2. 29. Then he <hi>reconciled</hi> all the Elect <hi>in
the body of his fleſh through death,</hi> Col. 1. 21, 22.
His death is that price that paid to the utmoſt
for all our ſinnes; our beſt workes cannot ſave
us, neither in whole nor in part.</p>
                     <p>4. Heaven is an inheritance, eternall inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
<hi>Heb. 9. 15. An inheritance incorruptible,
and undefiled, that fadeth not away, reſerved in
heaven for you,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 4. That which wee
poſſeſſe by right of inheritance, wee never
wrought for, nor paid for, <hi>left</hi> to one, <hi>Pro.</hi> 13.
26. <hi>falleth</hi> to one, <hi>Ezek. 47. 14. given.</hi> Jer. 3.
18. Acts 20. 32. Heb. 11. 6. Ezek. 33. 24.
Pſal. 78. 55. So this <hi>inheritance,</hi> Acts 26. 18.
Col. 1. 12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. 24. Chriſt bought it, and paid
for it <hi>his precious bloud,</hi> a great price, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.
18, 19. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 14. It coſt him ſo much, that
it might coſt us nothing: vaine man would
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:152344:209"/>
worke for it, to earne it, and merit it: men
thinke they muſt doe ſomething for it; our
doings could not procure it; God would not
have us to have it that way, but by way of
gift; its a free gift, as appeares, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23.
<hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8, 9. And that it could not be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if it had
been to be wrought for by us; <hi>To him that
worketh is the reward not reckoned [free] of
grace, but of debt,</hi> Rom. 4. 4. The children of
God are borne heires to it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. and
it was prepared for them before they were
borne; <hi>Come yee bleſſed of my Father, inherite
the Kingdome prepared for you from the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the world,</hi> Mat. 25. 34.</p>
                     <p>5. Wee are not exhorted to forſake evill
and doe good, to the end wee may be ſaved,
but becauſe it is our duty, conſider theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>Rom. 4. 5. &amp; 5. 19. &amp; 1. 17. Gal.</hi> 2. 17.
<hi>&amp; 3. 14. Joh. 3. 18. James 5. 24. Acts</hi> 10 43.</p>
                     <p>6. We doe nothing in the world to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
becauſe ſalvation is not given for our
workes, nor according to our workes: God
ſaith, <hi>he imputeth righteouſneſſe without workes,</hi>
Rom. 4. 6. <hi>Not of workes,</hi> Rom 9. 11. <hi>Who hath
ſaved us, and called us, not according to our workes,</hi>
2 Tim. 1. 9. <hi>Not of workes of righteouſneſſe which
we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved
us.</hi> Titus 3. 5. <hi>If by grace, it is no more of workes,
otherwiſe grace is no more grace: if it be of workes,
then it is not of grace,</hi> Rom. 11. 6. What can be
more plaine: Hence it is that <hi>wee are ceaſed
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:152344:210"/>
from our own workes,</hi> Heb. 4. 10. We did walke
in the way of workes for ſalvation, till God did
<hi>hedge up our way with thornes:</hi> our workes were
thoſe thornes which did pierce <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
us at the heart, in ſtead of ſaving us they
killed us; theſe thornes did ſo pricke us, that
we were not able to goe any further in that
way, God opened our eyes that wee ſaw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but death in them, then we ceaſed to
worke for life and ſalvation: We ought to doe
good workes, becauſe God commands us to
doe them, and becauſe they are for his glory;
ſee <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 8. 14. and becauſe we are <hi>loved,</hi>
and <hi>ſaved from our enemies,</hi> Luk. 1. 71. To doe
good workes, is good, but not for ſalvation:
fire is good, but not to put into the thatch,
nor under the bed, unleſſe yee meane to fire
the houſe. We perſwade to good workes and
ſtrictneſſe in holineſſe of life, becauſe we are
juſtified and ſaved without works, yea before
we did any good work for we did none before
we were called; <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called
us,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 9. We were ſaved when Chriſt
ſuffered upon the Croſſe, called when conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
both e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ected in time, but neither of them
was <hi>according to our workes, but according as he
had purpoſed before the world began:</hi> our workes
remove not our offences, nor make us juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God; that which can cauſe to be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
muſt be ſo perfect that the Law of God
cannot except againſt, ſee <hi>Lev 18. 5. Luk.</hi> 10
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:152344:210"/>
27, 28. Our beſt workes are not ſo, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they will not ſtand us in any ſtead for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:
If wee could be ſaved by any workes,
Chriſt dyed in vaine; <hi>I determined not to know

                     <p>Chriſts love cauſed him to dye for us, let
his love conſtraine us to ſerve him, he is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of our love; if he hath thy affections, he
ſhall have thy actions; if thou haſt taſted of
the ſweetneſſe of Chriſts love, thou wilt ſay,
there is none ſo ſweet as his, who in his
wounds hath buried and deſtroyed all thy ſins,
to redeeme thee from them, and purchaſe thy
ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>7. <hi>To doe for ſalvation, were to bring in
the law of workes; he that</hi> ſeekes to be juſtified
by the Law, is fallen from grace, <hi>Gal. 5. 4. The
Law concernes our converſation, not our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:</hi>
The righteouſneſſe of God is manifeſted
without the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 21. No man is juſtified
by the Law in the ſight of God, <hi>Gal. 3. 11. In mans
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:152344:211"/>
ſight he may:</hi> Jam. 2. 24. By the deeds of the
Law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.
20. We are not debtors to the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 23.</p>
                     <p>8. Thoſe that are ſuch great doers for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
doe as little as others; <hi>None of you keep
the Law,</hi> Joh. 7. 19. If yee ſay yee can keepe
the Law without fin, the Scripture doth call
you a lier, 1 <hi>Joh. 1. 8. There are none juſt upon
earth.</hi> Such as are ſuch great doers for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
are fit to be ranked with thoſe in <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.
22. Can you make your ſelfe righteous? can
you keep the Law? It forbids luſt, yea vaine
thoughts, <hi>Rom 7. 7. Gal.</hi> 3. 10. Unleſſe yee
can keepe the Law, yee cannot be ſaved by
workes.</p>
                     <p>9. So much as wee eye any of our workes
to be any thing in ſalvation it ſelfe, ſo much
we not onely neglect and ſlight Chriſt, but are
<hi>enemies to the Croſſe of Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 3. 18. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
they ſay or doe they are no better.</p>
                     <p>10. To doe any thing to be ſaved, is but
wicked obedience; all is uncleane, <hi>Their minds
and conſciences are defiled,</hi> Titus 1. 15, 16. The
more they doe, the more hypocrites they are.
What men doe to eſcape hell, and get heaven,
is wicked ſerving of God, for that they doe is
<hi>not in faith,</hi> therefore <hi>it is ſinne,</hi> Rom. 14. and
doe not pleaſe God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. If <hi>the plowing
of he wicked is ſinne,</hi> what is his praying; untill
Chriſts love conſtraines the heart to love and
ſerve him, there is no love to God in what
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:152344:211"/>
they doe, all is but ſelfe-love, their own ends
are all they aime at; but when the <hi>love of God
is ſhed abroad into their hearts, they will ſerve God
freely,</hi> Luk. 1. 74.</p>
                     <p>11. We doe nothing to be ſaved, becauſe
we ſaw that when we had <hi>done all we could, wee
were unprofitable ſervants,</hi> Luk 17. 10. Which
could not be if we could have ſaved our ſelves,
or effect the leaſt part of our ſalvation by any
thing we could doe: wee ſee we ſin in all our
workes, they are no better then <hi>Pauls,</hi> and he
calls his <hi>dung,</hi> Phil. 3. 8. Dung is fit for the
dunghill; Such are not worth the mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
much leſſe magnifying; <hi>O Lord, I will
make mention of thy Righteouſneſſe, even of thine
onely,</hi> Pſal. 71. 16. 24. <hi>We have no confidence in
the fleſh,</hi> none in our ſelves, but in Chriſt,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 3. We live to Chriſts righteouſneſſe,
we are dead to our own, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 19, 20. Our
workes are our glory, God ſpoiles us of our
glory, that we might glory in Chriſt, <hi>I be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi>
2 Cor. 12. 11. All we can doe cannot
ſatisfie for one vaine thought; our workes are
a moſt miſerable, rotten, and ſandy foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
if our ſalvation ſhould depend upon them,
it did depend upon a broken reed: no man
is righteous in himſelfe; wee are not juſt in
our ſelves, but in another, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. Saving
benefits are in Chriſt, and not in us, our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe
is in Chriſt, and him crucified.</p>
                     <p>12. Doers for ſalvation, as confident as they
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:152344:212"/>
are, ſuch were ſhut out of heaven, thoſe in
<hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22. were confident heaven ſhould be
opened to them; their plea to enter into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
was, becauſe they <hi>had done many great and
wondrous workes</hi> (tis worth the obſerving) they
thought it an unanſwerable argument, yet
they were ſhut out, heaven was not provided
for them, <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Harlots</hi> were <hi>ſaved,</hi>
but not they, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 31. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He
knew them not.</hi> What? Doth not Chriſt know
great workers for ſalvation, no, he neither
knows them, nor they him. Such as look for
ſalvation to be on condition of workes, ſeeke
to attaine it by workes, they prize their own
righteouſneſſe in ſtead of Chriſts; ſee <hi>Rom.</hi>
10. 3. Such as know Chriſts righteouſneſſe,
prize it, its glorious in their eyes; our workes
are as nothing to us, they vaniſh before us
<hi>like the morning dew,</hi> as <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6, 4. They prize,
ſet up, and eſteeme nothing but Chriſt. Your
concluſion, its your deluſion; conſider againe
and ſee if you can ſee whoſe is the errour, who
is deceived and ſtrangely deluded, I deſire
you may ſee, looke on it well and ſubmit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Geree:</hi> Who ſo blind as he that cannot ſee with
halfe an eye, that beleeving is the condition of the
party juſtified, <hi>p.</hi> 82. Wee muſt beleeve before we
can be juſtified, <hi>p.</hi> 81. The Doctor doth moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlily
inferre, that a man is juſtified actually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he hath faith, <hi>p. 83. He ſaith,</hi> We are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
before we beleeve; this is the thing in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:152344:212"/>
                        <hi>p.</hi> 87. He makes a wicked and ſinfull ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
between Chriſt and faith, in the point of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
which methinkes ſhould make all true
Chriſtians abhorre their Doctrine as helliſh and
apoſtaticall, <hi>p.</hi> 95. The Doctor holds, that Chriſt
juſtifieth us before any qualification is wrought in
us: he ſaith, Faith comes after Juſtification as well
as workes, and ſo excludes Faith in Juſtification,
<hi>p.</hi> 18. 34. The Apoſtle ſaith, Wee are juſtified by
faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 23. The Doctor ſaith, before wee
beleeve.</p>
                     <p>You cry out againſt us, our anſwer is to all
your ſharp arrowes, moſt bitter words, <hi>The
Lord rebuke thee:</hi> You will have us to ſee what
ſpirit you are of; I hope the Lord will let you
ſee and ſay, that you condemned the truth,
and thoſe that taught it, and that the errour
and helliſh doctrine and blaſphemy is your
owne.</p>
                     <p>You ſee the Word faith in Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi>
3. 23. But its evident yee ſee not the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it. What the Scripture ſaith is true,
and ſo is what the Doctor ſaith; its but your
miſ-take to thinke otherwiſe; wee deny not,
but affirme we are juſtified by faith; but we
deny we are juſtified by beleeving; for the
word <hi>Faith,</hi> is not alwayes to be underſtood
for beleeving: the Scripture doth not ſay,
wee are juſtified for, nor through, nor by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving,
neither doth it follow, that wee are
juſtified by beleeving, becauſe the Scripture
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:152344:213"/>
ſaith, <hi>We are juſtified by faith;</hi> becauſe the
word <hi>Faith</hi> is diverſly underſtood; as,</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Sometimes by faith is meant the doctrine
of Chriſt,</hi> Jude 3. Obedience to the faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.
7. In the faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. Hearing of faith;
preacheth the faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 23.</p>
                     <p>2. So for the power by which we beleeve,
<hi>Gal. 5. 22. Phil.</hi> 1. 29.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Faith is to beleeve;</hi> have faith in God,
Mark. 11. 22.</p>
                     <p>4. Sometimes by faith is meant the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 8.</p>
                     <p>5. By faith we are to underſtand know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 22.</p>
                     <p>6. Sometimes Chriſt is called <hi>faith</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi>
3. 16. with 19. 23. <hi>The ſeed</hi> in the 19. verſe is
called faith in 23 verſe, and Chriſt in the 16
verſe: So that to be juſtified through faith,
and by faith, that is, through Chriſt, <hi>through
his bloud,</hi> Eph. 1. 7. <hi>Through the Redemption
that is in Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 3. 24. So the word <hi>through
him</hi> is uſed 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 9. Through him and by
him is all one, <hi>Eph. 1. 5. 7. That the bleſſing
of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through
Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3. 14. Compare <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 14.
28. with <hi>Rom. 5. 9. Iſa. 45. 24, 25. Mat.</hi> 9. 22.
<hi>Eph. 2. 8. Acts 15. 9. Gal. 3. 26. Eph.</hi> 1. 5.
Thoſe expreſſions of Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that aſcribe
moſt to Chriſt, are the cleareſt; the other are
to be interpreted by them; for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are to be interpreted for Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:152344:213"/>
againſt him. Alſo we are to conſider, if the
word <hi>Faith</hi> were alwaies to be underſtood for
beleeving; by <hi>Levit.</hi> 17. 11. it appeares that
was aſcribed to the ſigne which is proper to
the thing ſignified.</p>
                     <p>The word <hi>Juſtifie,</hi> it ſignifieth to make juſt:
men are made juſt three wayes.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, By infuſion; ſo <hi>Adam,</hi> Eccleſ. 7. 29.</p>

19. <hi>Eph. 1. 5. Rom.</hi> 3. 24. In this ſenſe the
Elect are juſtified by Chriſt, for we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by another, and in another; Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and Juſtification are one; when he was
<hi>made our Righteouſneſſe,</hi> then he was <hi>made our
Juſtification,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 30. We are made righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
by his ſatisfaction, therefore we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
by his ſatisfaction: to deny this were
to overthrow the foundation of Religion, and
mans ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Men are ſaid to be juſtified by
Sentence: in this ſenſe a man may juſtifie
himſelfe; ſo <hi>Job</hi> 9. 20. or by witneſſes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.
9. 26. In a large ſenſe, this is called Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
and ſometimes this Juſtification is
worth nothing, and worſe then nothing; as

<hi>&amp;</hi> 24. 24. Wee are juſtified by the Spirit,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. But this is not that Juſtification
on which depends our eternall happineſſe;
this is onely declared to us by the Spirit, that
we are juſtified by Chriſts death; this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:152344:214"/>
of it is onely neceſſary to ſatisfie &amp; quiet
the Conſcience: Chriſt having juſtified his
upon the Croſſe by his bloud, it is (not our
beleeving but) the Spirit that reveales the
ſame to the ſoule: <hi>The Spirit dwelleth in us,</hi>
1 <hi>Cor. 3. 16. 1 Cor. 9. 19. Rom.</hi> 8. 11. 16.
1 <hi>Joh. 3. 24. The Spirit ſpeaketh in us,</hi> Mat. 10.
20. and ſheweth us what Chriſt hath done for
us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9, 10. with 16. 13, 14, 15. <hi>Heb.</hi>
10. 15. 17. 1 <hi>Joh. 5. 6. The bloud of ſprinkling</hi>
is the Spirits ſpeaking to the conſcience that
all is paid; this ſatisfieth and clenſeth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 24. The worke of faith is
onely to aſſent to the teſtimony of the Spirit,
that it is truth, and ſo receives its teſtimony:
to manifeſt and to receive the manifeſtation
are not one thing, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 5. When the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is beleeved, the anſwer of a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is, My ſweet Jeſus dyed for me, he hath
delivered me from all my enemies, and from
the wrath to come; the debt of all my ſinne
is paid, there is nothing now to be required
of me: <hi>What ſhall I render to the Lord for all his
goodneſſe unto me? O that men would praiſe the
Lord for his goodneſſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. 8.</p>
                     <p>There is a Juſtification before men by good
workes, <hi>James</hi> 2. 24. which declareth to men
we are juſtified viſibly, but not infallibly; but
this is not that Juſtification which ſaveth us;
that Juſtification I treat, is of that Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
which freeth us from condemnation;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:152344:214"/>
for Juſtification is oppoſed to condemnation,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1, 2. For his death was our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the puniſhment of ſinne; this is the
Juſtification that I intend, and contend for;
for in this is our ſalvation, therefore in this is
our greateſt happineſſe and glory.</p>
                     <p>And that the Elect from the beginning to
the end of the world, were juſtified at and by
Chriſts death upon the Croſſe; Conſider</p>
                     <p>Juſtification is that which is our freedome
from the puniſhment of ſinne; this I have
proved was at and by Chriſts death: and that
I may more fully put this queſtion out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion;
namely, that we are not juſtified by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving,
but before we beleeve by Chriſt; I
prove by theſe Arguments or Reaſons.</p>
                     <p>1 <hi>Argu.</hi> If Juſtification is free, then belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
is not required; for that which is free, is
without any condition or conſideration of any
thing in us, or done b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> us; but we are <hi>juſtified
freely,</hi> Rom. 3. 24. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it be Chriſt, and his workes, it is not I
and my workes that can juſtifie me from the
puniſhment of ſinne: if Chriſt ſaves us, then
beleeving doth not ſave us: compare <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.
42, 43. with <hi>Mat. 10. 37. Luk.</hi> 14. 26.</p>
                     <p>If it be Chriſt and my beleeving together,
that ſaves me, then Chriſt doth not ſave me;
if it be Chriſt and my workes, then I ſhare in
ſaving my ſelfe: To ſay we are juſtified by
Chriſt and beleeving together (as ſome ſay)
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:152344:215"/>
is to deny we are juſtified by either; for that
which is not alone, doth not juſtifie alone;
he that is juſtified by two, is juſtified by nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Chriſt and faith together, ſay you;
Chriſt and workes together, ſay the Papiſts;
wee are not juſtified without beleeving, ſay
you; not without charity, ſay the Papiſts;
that which they ſay is Popery, ſo is what you
ſay, becauſe what yon both ſay is in the nature
of it one, and though you differ in the letters
that expreſſe it, yet in ſubſtance it is one and
the ſame thing.</p>
                     <p>2 <hi>Argu.</hi> If Chriſt juſtified <hi>enemies, ſinners,
ungodly,</hi> &amp;c. then they were not beleevers
when they were juſtified; but Chriſt juſtified
<hi>enemies,</hi> Kom. 4. 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. 10. Beleevers are
not ſo called, they are called <hi>friends,</hi> Luk. 12.
4. Joh. 15. 15. <hi>Saints,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 2. <hi>Holy and
beloved,</hi> Col. 3. 12. <hi>Holy brethren,</hi> Heb. 3. 1.
<hi>Holy women.</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 5. If holy, then not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly;
<hi>Babes in Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 1. Therefore
we were juſtified before we beleeved; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
beleeving comes too late to juſtifie us
from the puniſhment of ſinne, if we were not
juſtified till we beleeve, he doth not juſtifie
the ungodly it is evident.</p>

                        </hi> In the ſame manner we are made

                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. to 20. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 5. Therefore his
obedience juſtified us from all ſinne, <hi>viz.</hi> from
all the puniſhment of ſinne; therefore ever
ſince his death we have been juſtified; alſo if
juſtified by <hi>his obedience,</hi> then not juſtified by
beleeving; as our ſinfulnes conſiſts in that one
diſobedience of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
conſiſts in that one (onely) obedience
of our ſweet Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>4 <hi>Argu.</hi> Thoſe God declares to be juſt and
righteous, they are juſt before; therefore
made ſo by Chriſt; if they be not juſt, they
are wicked, and to declare them to be juſt, is
to <hi>juſtifie the wicked, which he ſaith is abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to him,</hi> Pro. 17. 15.</p>
                     <p>5 <hi>Argu.</hi> If Chriſt did dye for us truly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
and actually, then he did truly, really, and
actually juſtifie us; but Chriſt did dye for us
truly, really, and actually, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 15. it was
not in a <hi>ſhadow,</hi> Col. 2. 17. Therefore he tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and really took away ſin, <hi>viz.</hi> actually ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
us from all the puniſhment of ſinne; and
in that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Without bloud there is

the prophecies concerning Chriſts death were

true, <hi>Jeſus knew that all things were accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the Scripture might be fulfilled,</hi> ſaith, <hi>I

thirſt; when he had received the vinegar, he ſaid,
it is finiſhed, and he bowed his head, and gave up

<hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 4. and I beleeve him.</p>
                     <p>7 <hi>Argu.</hi> If I am to beleeve, I am juſtified,
it is either true or falſe; if true, then I was ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
before I beleeved it; if not true, then
for me to beleeve I am juſtified when I am
not, is for me to beleeve a lye, and deceive my
ſelfe; nor doth God require me to beleeve a
lye, and for me to beleeve I am juſtified, that
ſo I may be juſtified, is to beleeve a lye that it
may be true, which is unreaſonable; for my

So Chriſt paying our debt, is our juſtification
from ſinne, our freedome from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

who are his,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 19. with Exod. 28. 21.
&amp;c. By his knowledge he knew thee and me,
and he loved thee and me, and gave himſelfe

and to beare the pun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſhment of ſinne, is
one thing; if we are juſtified through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
which is in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24.
Therefore it is evident, wee are not juſtified
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:152344:220"/>
through beleeving, <hi>Rev. 5. 9. This is my body
which was broken for you,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 24. He had
not dyed but for you, and in his knowledge
and love you were when he dyed for you;
here are ſweet conſolations.</p>
                     <p>19 <hi>Argu.</hi> If we are not juſtified by workes,
then if beleeving be a worke, then we are not
juſtified by beleeving, but we are not juſtified
by workes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. That beleeving is a worke,
appeares</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Becauſe we are</hi> commanded to beleeve, <hi>as
to</hi> love one another, <hi>as he</hi> gave us commandement,
1 <hi>Joh. 3. 23. If we are commanded to doe it,
its a worke.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. To obey a command is a worke, but to
beleeve is to obey a command; faith is an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
of the will of God, therefore a worke;
<hi>faith</hi> is called <hi>a ſervice,</hi> the <hi>ſervice of your faith,</hi>
Phil. 2. 17. If it be a ſervice, it is a worke;
<hi>the worke of faith,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1. 11. The act and
exerciſe of our faith is a worke.</p>
                     <p>3. Its a worke, becauſe we are reproved
for the <hi>ſmallneſſe of our faith,</hi> Mat. 6. 30. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.
26. If it were no way acted by us, why are we
reproved for not beleeving; if we are not to
doe it, why are we reproved for not doing it?</p>
                     <p>4. Its a worke, becauſe the Saints are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
to doe it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. We are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
to any thing but that which is our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to doe, if it be a duty, it is a worke,</p>
                     <p>5. To beleeve, is a worke of all the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:152344:221"/>
of the ſoule, the underſtanding, will, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
memory, affections.</p>
                     <p>6. To receive a thing, is an act of the whole
man, but to beleeve a thing, is to receive it,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
                     <p>7. Not to beleeve, is a worke of darkneſſe,
therefore to beleeve is a <hi>worke of righteouſneſſe,</hi>
Titus 3. 5.</p>
                     <p>8. Faith is required in all we doe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it partakes of the nature of a worke, and
ſo is a worke, and without it we cannot doe
any good worke, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6.</p>
                     <p>9. Its a worke, becauſe wee are ſaid to doe
it, <hi>If [thou] beleeveſt, [I doe beleeve</hi>] Acts 8.
38. <hi>With the heart [man] beleeveth,</hi> Rom. 10.
9, 10. It is an action of the heart conſiſting in
judgement, and he doth it as truly as <hi>he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
with his mouth:</hi> it is improper to ſay,
beleeve doth beleeve, love doth love, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
doth repent, but we being moved by the
Spirit of God, we doe beleeve, we love, and
we repent; not God, but we by his power.</p>
                     <p>10. If to confeſſe Chriſt is a worke, then to
beleeve is a worke, and one of the <hi>workes of
righteouſneſſe we have done,</hi> Titus 3. 5. If it be
ſaid, that faith is put in oppoſition to workes,
and therefore faith is not a worke: I anſwer,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, When faith is put in oppoſition to
workes, then by faith we are to underſtand
Chriſt, becauſe he alone is our Righteouſneſſe,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 28.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:152344:221"/>
Secondly, When the Apoſtle excludes
workes in Juſtification, by workes we are to
underſtand all outward and inward acts, faith
it ſelfe, for ſeeing works are excluded, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
being a work it is excluded with the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It will be granted that the workes
of the Law were excluded in Juſtification;
then it will follow, faith is excluded, becauſe
no command of the Law could be obeyed
without faith, therefore faith was a part of the
fulfilling of the Law: that faith was required,
appeares, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 37, 38. 40. The Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<hi>purity,</hi> and that could not be without
<hi>faith;</hi> for thoſe that <hi>beleeve not, are defiled,
their minds and conſciences are defiled,</hi> Titus 1.
15. Therefore beleeving was required under
the Law as well as under the Goſpel: as to
love the Lord is a duty now as ever, and ever
as now; that which is our Righteouſneſſe, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
us to be accepted, cauſeth us to be ſaved;
but that is Chriſt, and not our beleeving,
<hi>Ezra 9. 15. Righteouſneſſe belongs to God,</hi> Dan.
9. 7. Its proper to Chriſt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 6. Our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
is neither God nor Chriſt. We are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
by the act of faith; <hi>anſw.</hi> Then we are
not juſtified by Chriſt, by his bloud; Chriſt
hath deſerved to accept our faith for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe;
<hi>anſw.</hi> Gods judgement is according
to truth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 2. He accepts it in mercy,
not in juſtice: <hi>anſw.</hi> Doth God judge or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
a thing to be that which it is not.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="86" facs="tcp:152344:222"/>
20 <hi>Argu.</hi> If juſtification is an act of God,
then it is not an act of beleeving; but its an
act of God; <hi>its God that juſtifieth,</hi> Rom. 8. 33.
<hi>Chriſt is God; My righteous ſervant ſhall juſtifie
many,</hi> Iſa. 53. 11. Rom. 5. 9. Ever ſince his
death our ſinnes have been <hi>removed,</hi> Zach. 3. 9.
Joh. 1. 29. Col. 1. 20.</p>
                     <p>21 <hi>Argu.</hi> If we are juſtified by his bloud,
then we are not juſtified by beleeving; but
we are <hi>juſtified by his bloud,</hi> Rom. 5. 9. <hi>Through
his Redemption,</hi> Rom. 4. 24. Therefore not
through our beleeving; for bloud, Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and beleeving are not one thing.</p>
                     <p>22 <hi>Argu.</hi> That which is our juſtification,
that is our peace; <hi>but Chriſt is our peace,</hi> Eph.
2. 14, 15. 17. Therefore Chriſt is our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and not beleeving.</p>
                     <p>23 <hi>Argu.</hi> That which covereth our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
that juſtifieth us; but Chriſt <hi>covereth our
iniquity,</hi> Iſa. 59. 2. Therefore he is our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
as that which is covered, is not ſeene
to men, and that which is not ſeene, is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,
and that which is not imputed, cannot
be puniſhed, no more will God impute any
ſinne to his, 2 Cor. 5. 18. But his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
Imputation ſignifying accounting, or
recounting what was ours, not to be ours, not
imputing their treſpaſſes to them, 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 5. 19.
Not reckoning to us ſinne, and ſo not the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of ſinne, and imputing or reckoning
Chriſts righteouſneſſe to be ours for it is ours.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="87" facs="tcp:152344:222"/>
24 <hi>Argu.</hi> If our juſtification is in another,
then we are not juſtified in our ſelves; but we
are juſtified in another; <hi>In the Lord ſhall the
children of Iſrael be juſtified, and ſhall glory,</hi> Iſa.
45. 25. Our juſtification is our glory, and we
glory in it: beliefe is in us; ſee <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 8.
<hi>&amp; 7 9. 13, 14. Iſa.</hi> 61. 10. Therefore belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
is not our Juſtification.</p>
                     <p>25 <hi>Argu.</hi> Where our Righteouſneſſe is,
there is our Juſtification; but our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is in Chriſt; <hi>In the Lord is our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
Jer. 23. 6. Sufficient to ſecure us from
the puniſhment of ſinne: that which is our
Righteouſneſſe, is our Juſtification; Chriſt
is that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. Therefore beleeving is
not our Righteouſneſſe, nor our Juſtification,
<hi>Iſa. 45. 24. Rom.</hi> 4. 24. The Papiſts judge their
workes to be that which ſaves them, upon ſuch
places as theſe; <hi>Mark. 16. 16. Pro.</hi> 28. 18.
<hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 17. to 23. <hi>Mark. 13. 3. James</hi> 2. 24.
1 <hi>Tim. 4. 16. 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 16.</p>
                     <p>26 <hi>Argu.</hi> Juſtification is a ſpirituall bleſſing,
therefore where our ſpirituall bleſſings are,
there is our Juſtification; but <hi>all ſpirituall
bleſſings are in Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 1. 3. <hi>In him,</hi> 2 Cor.
5. 21. Saving benefits and bleſſings are not in
us, but ſuch things as accompany ſalvation:
Saving and accompanying ſalvation are not
one.</p>
                     <p>27 <hi>Argu.</hi> Where we are accepted, there we
are juſtified; but <hi>we are accepted in the beloved,</hi>
                        <pb n="88" facs="tcp:152344:223"/>
Eph. 1. 6. Therefore we are juſtified in the
beloved: ſo we are compleat in his compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
not in our ſelves but in him is our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
<hi>Col.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
                     <p>28 <hi>Argu.</hi> Our Juſtification is a part of our
compleatneſſe, therefore where we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat,
there we are juſtified; but <hi>we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
in him,</hi> Col. 2 10. Therefore we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in him; therefore we are not juſtified in
our ſelves, nor by beleeving.</p>
                     <p>29 <hi>Argu.</hi> If we be juſtified by grace, and
beleeving is not grace, then we are not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by beleeving, but we are <hi>juſtified by grace,</hi>
Rom. 4. 24. Titus 3 7. Beleeving is not grace,
the <hi>fruits of the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5. 22, 23. are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
graces by men, but not by God; the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
calls them not ſo; faith, love, meekneſſe,
temperance, peace, joy, &amp;c. are not graces, but
effects of grace, gifts of grace, or from grace,
grace is but one, there are not many graces,
though there be many gifts of love, which are
the effects of it, which all are the gifts of grace,
<hi>Rom. 2. 6. 1 Cor.</hi> 12. 4. Grace is out of us in
the good will and pleaſure of God; and Chriſts
death was an effect of grace, of Gods grace is
love, <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 7. We are exhorted to grow in
grace, <hi>viz.</hi> in the knowledge of the love of
God, &amp;c. <hi>He that beleeves hath the witneſſe in
him;</hi> but faith is not this witneſſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10.
2 <hi>Cor. 4. 13. The ſeed that remaineth in us,</hi> is not
God, but the Word of God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 11, 12.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:152344:223"/>
                        <hi>Rom. 10. 17. Rom.</hi> 8. 30. It declareth the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Gods diſpencing theſe priviledges to
us; the ſetting of one thing before another,
doth not alwayes prove the being of it before
it; ſee 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 30. Rev.</hi> 5. 9. If men be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
before juſtified, men are not juſtified by
beleeving; for if they be called they beleeve,
or elſe how are they called; if they be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and yet are not juſtified, it is becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
could not juſtifie them. We are alſo
to conſider when Scriptures were written, if
before Chriſts death or after: Some of thoſe
before his death, ſaith; as ſome object; <hi>He
ſhall redeeme Iſrael,</hi> Pſal. 130. 8. <hi>He ſhall juſtifie,</hi>
Iſa. 53. 11. <hi>He ſhall ſave his people from their
ſinnes,</hi> Mat. 1. 20, 21. Theſe ſpeake in the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
tenſe, he ſhall come; for as yet Chriſt was
not borne: but after Chriſts death the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſpeaketh in the Preſent tenſe, becauſe he
had then actually done it; ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 10.
12. 14. <hi>Rev. 1. 5. &amp;</hi> 5. 9. Before Chriſts death
it was commonly expreſſed that he ſhould do
it; now Chriſt hath done it, wee may not ſay
it is to doe. Juſtification by beleeving is
not to be underſtood of Juſtification it ſelfe,
but the manifeſtation of it in the conſcience;
for the Scripture attributes that to a thing,
which is not a cauſe, nor meanes, nor effect
of it, but a meere ſhadow of it; as appeares,
<hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 30. compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 11.
Col. 2. 17. Till Chriſt dyed there was no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:152344:224"/>
for any one ſinne; the Father truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Chriſt for the ſins of the Elect till Chriſts
death, and then Chriſt made payment for the
ſinnes of his Elect to the end of the world.</p>
                     <p>30 <hi>Argu.</hi> If we are healed by Chriſts ſtripes,
then we were healed before we beleeved, for
his ſtripes were before his death when he
dyed upon the Croſſe; but <hi>Chriſts ſtripes hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
us; By whoſe ſtripes we are healed,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.
24. Therefore beleeving doth not heale us;
then ever ſince Chriſts death we have been
ſound and whole, even before we knew it; ſee
<hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 16.</p>
                     <p>31 <hi>Argu.</hi> If men are <hi>given to Chriſt</hi> before
they beleeve, then beleeving doth not make
men belong to Chriſt; but the firſt is true,
<hi>Joh. 6. 37. Joh.</hi> 17. 6. Therefore the latter is
true alſo.</p>
                     <p>32 <hi>Argu.</hi> If ſalvation is <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> then it is
not in us, much leſſe in beleeving, but ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 10. Mat.</hi> 1. 21.</p>
                     <p>33 <hi>Argu.</hi> If the cauſe why we <hi>ſhall live,</hi> is,
<hi>becauſe Chriſt lives,</hi> Joh. 14. 19. then beleeving
is not the cauſe why we ſhall live: if we <hi>are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
to God through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 7.
then not through beleeving; ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 10,
11. for beleeving is not Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>34 <hi>Argu.</hi> If our ſalvation depends upon the

beleeving, but it depends upon the promiſe
of God, <hi>Heb. 13. 8. Heb.</hi> 6. 17, 18.</p>

we are ſaved is, becauſe none are able to

                     <p>36 <hi>Argu.</hi> If our ſalvation depends upon
the faithfulneſſe of God, then it depends not
on our beleeving; but it depends upon the

7. 18. 20.</p>
                     <p>37 <hi>Argu.</hi> If the Reaſon why we are <hi>not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed,</hi>
is, <hi>Becauſe the Lord changeth not,</hi> Mal. 3. 6.
Then it is not becauſe we beleeve; we change
oft, but he never, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. The ground of

                     <p>I would know of you that hold we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by beleeving, whether faith in the nature
and power of it doth juſtifie or no; if yea, I
would know how the power to beleeve apart
from the exerciſe of it can be knowne to us,
and how it may be called faith, when there is
no beleeving; and whether the light and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
by which we beleeve, be not the ſame by
which we obey the reſt of the commands of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:152344:225"/>
God, and how it can be diſtinguiſhed apart
or without beleeving; if it juſtifieth us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
its act, can you tell how and when you
were juſtified; for if it may be in the ſoule
one houre, and not act, why not two ſeven
yeares; and whether this opinion doth not
imply, that a man may have faith, and be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
by it, and yet not know it, nor beleeve;
if faith juſtifieth in reſpect of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and meritoriouſneſſe of it, whether it
will not follow that we are not juſtified by
the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, but by that of
faith which is in our ſelves, and ſo need not
looke at a righteouſneſſe in another, in Chriſt,
if the act of faith juſtifie, whether we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
by one act or many, if by one, how we
may know it or diſtinguiſh it, that we may
not ſo act faith againe needleſly; for what
need is there of more then one, if one be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;
if many acts of faith be required to
juſtifie us, it is neceſſary to know how many,
that ſo we may know when we are juſtified;
if we are to act faith continually to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
becauſe we ſin continually, it will follow
we are not juſtified for ever, and that we may

and then he is by faith to be juſtified againe;

Chriſt, or an abrogating unto faith, to ſay by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
we live and are juſtified from ſinne, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Joh. 3. 33. p. 92.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> How can it be otherwiſe, ſeeing yee
diſhonour Chriſt, and put him to open ſhame:
it is a very great evill yee doe; your evill is
great and grievous:</p>
                     <p>For 1. Chriſt ſhould be lifted up, but yee
pull him downe, in that yee deny him his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and glory; yee derogate from his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
in that yee deny it to be ſufficient to
ſave us.</p>
                     <p>2. Yee bring in workes, beleeving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
&amp;c. as joynt cauſes of ſalvation, and
deliverance from wrath.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="94" facs="tcp:152344:226"/>
3. In deſiring ſomething beyond his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
yee make Chriſt an imperfect Prieſt,
and his ſacrifice imperfect.</p>
                     <p>4. Ye diſgrace Chriſt, in adding your righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
to his; ye deny the efficacy of his
death, and deny him to be able to ſave to the
uttermoſt.</p>
                     <p>5. In that ye would have ſomething done
for ſalvation, ye deny it depends alone upon
Chriſt; for it depends not alone upon him, if
it alſo depends upon any other condition
or additions.</p>
                     <p>6. Ye deny ſalvation to be a free gift, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
given us, if we muſt doe for it, and ſo earne
it, elſe (as you ſay) we ſhall not have it, and
ſo you make ſalvation uncertaine and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                     <p>7. Ye make Chriſt a meere ſhadow in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of your workes, in ſaying the promiſe
of God, and the death of Chriſt is fruſtrate to
us, unleſſe we performe ſuch conditions.</p>
                     <p>8. In ſaying we are juſtified by beleeving,
ye deny we are juſtified by Chriſt, which is
dangerous, though it hath a ſhew of truth,
becauſe Chriſt and beleeving are two things;
ſo that its to divide our Juſtification between
God and man, Chriſt and us, his workes and
ours.</p>
                     <p>9. Ye deny Juſtification and Salvation to
be accompliſhed by Chriſts obedience, in
making it to depend upon our obedience,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:152344:226"/>
and ſo ye impute it in part (if but in part) to
our ſelves, &amp; ſo overthrow the death of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>10. Ye make not Chriſt, but faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
&amp;c. the meanes of our ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>11. Ye give that to beleeving, &amp;c. which is
proper to Chriſt, in that ye attribute Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
(which is the chiefe and maine thing
Chriſt hath done for us) to beleeving, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.
24. <hi>&amp;</hi> 53. 11.</p>
                     <p>12. You make beleeving a cauſe of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
in ſaying without it we cannot be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified.</p>
                     <p>13. In ſaying beleeving is imputed for
righteouſneſſe, ye make it our righteouſneſſe,
or charge God to impute that for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
which is not righteouſneſſe.</p>
                     <p>14. Your opinion ingendreth unto bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
it leaves the conſcience in feare, it robs
it of peace, joy, and conſolation; its an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to a chearfull and free ſerving of God.</p>
                     <p>15. To ſay that we are juſtified by Chriſt
and faith together, is diſhonourable to Chriſt;
for if we be juſtified by both, then not by one,
and ſo Chriſt is made no Saviour, in their
judgements he is but a halfe Saviour. I deſire
to know how it can be made out that we are
juſtified by Chriſt, if we be juſtified by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;
if we are <hi>juſtified by his bloud,</hi> Rom. 5. 9.
Unleſſe beleeving be his bloud, we are not
juſtified by beleeving: the Scripture doth not
ſay that any one is juſtified from ſinne by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:152344:227"/>
but we have been taught ſo, and it is
no eaſie matter to unlearne and leave a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
principle.</p>
                     <p>16. Chriſt hath not all the glory of our
ſalvation, if we joyne beleeving or workes to
Chriſt as a copa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ner with him: faith muſt
have a part of it, and we our ſelves; for wee
beleeve as you confeſſe, <hi>p.</hi> 6.</p>
                     <p>17. In ſaying we are not loved nor accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
untill we beleeve, ye deny we are accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for Chriſt ſake.</p>
                     <p>18. Ye attribute righteouſneſſe in part to
our ſelves, in attributing it in part to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving:
many pleaſe themſelves with a conceit
that they doe not diſhonour Chriſt in attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
ſalvation to beleeving, becauſe faith
is from Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>19. If we may aſcribe Juſtification to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
then by the ſame Reaſon we may aſcribe
Juſtification to love, patience, temperance, &amp;c.
yea to all our performances, our good workes,
prayers, teares, &amp;c. Becauſe the power by
which we doe theſe is Chriſts; <hi>Without me ye
can doe nothing,</hi> Joh. 15. 5.</p>
                     <p>20 You make Chriſt no Saviour at all,
though you confeſſe Chriſt dyed for us, yet

of the Covenant of grace. When you write

ſame reaſon another may be ſaved in the want

forth what men are in appearance, and not
what they are in reſpect of the eternall decree
and appointment of God: for thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve

And if it were his will that they ſhould be

if beleeving could have been that to them,
Chriſt might have been ſpared.</p>

the Elect were <hi>choſen before the world,</hi> Eph 1. 4.
Adoption is acceptation of us in Chriſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we were children before we beleeve:
before God declares mercy to <hi>Ephraim,</hi> he
calls him his Sonne; <hi>Ephraim my Sonne, I will
ſurely have mercy upon him,</hi> Jer. 31. 20.</p>
                     <p>2. The action of the Father is before the
action of the Sonne; adoption is attributed
to the Father, therefore it muſt in order be
before Redemption, which is the worke of the
S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nne; ſo that the Elect were choſen before
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:152344:231"/>
Chriſt did redeeme them by his death, <hi>Rev</hi> 5.
9 Therefore adoption is before our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3, 4, 5. And our Redemption
was before we beleeved, <hi>Rev.</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. 10. And
therefore wee were ſonnes before we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</p>
                     <p>3. If we were not ſonnes before Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
he could not have <hi>brought ſonnes to glory
through ſuffering,</hi> Heb. 2. 10. If not ſonnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſuffered, how could we be his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren?
<hi>It beh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ved him to be like unto his brethren,</hi>
verſ. 17. But if they had not been children,
they could not be his brethren; alſo Chriſt
by his death juſtified children.</p>
                     <p>4. We were given to Chriſt before he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
for us, then we were heires, ſonnes;
<hi>If ye be Chriſts, then are ye Abrahams ſeed and
heires,</hi> &amp;c. That is, children of God, <hi>Gal</hi> 3. 29.
So that our being Chriſts, makes us the ſeed,
and not our beleeving.</p>
                     <p>5. If a childe differs nothing from a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 1. That is, one that is not a childe,
then he is a childe before he beleeves; for if
he beleeves, he differs apparently.</p>
                     <p>6. We are ſonnes before we beleeve, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we cannot beleeve without the Spirit;
for faith is a <hi>fruit of the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5. 22.
Therefore we have the Spirit before we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve;
and we are ſonnes before we have the
Spirit; for the Spirit had not been <hi>ſent into
their hearts,</hi> if they had not been ſonnes; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:152344:231"/>
yee are ſonnes, God hath ſent forth the Spirit
of his Sonne into our hearts,</hi> Gal. 4. 5. If the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
he ſent the Spirit into their hearts, was,
becauſe they were ſonnes; then it was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the ſmallneſſe of the meaſure they
had received; therefore <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 5. is to be
underſtood of the firſt ſending it into their
hearts.</p>
                     <p>7. If beleeving makes us the children of
God, it will follow, we have no union nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in God without our act; for <hi>we beleeve;</hi>
this ſutes well with Popery.</p>
                     <p>8. Its againſt truth and reaſon to beleeve,
that by beleeving I make my ſelfe a ſon, and
God my father; if I beleeve my ſelfe to
be a Kings ſonne, will beleeving it make me
ſo: if I beleeve braſſe is gold, will it be ſo;
he that is a Prince knowes not that he is ſo,
untill ſome time after he is ſo; yet he is a
Sonne and a Prince whether he knowes it or
beleeves it or no: therefore beleeving makes
us not ſonnes, but by it we ſee our ſelves to be
ſonnes, and injoy the comfort of it by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving.</p>
                     <p>9. Some teach and ſay, by baptiſme I was
made a member of Chriſt, a childe of God,
and an inheritor of the kingdome of heaven:
and you ſay, by beleeving: yet its by nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>10. Some have beleeved themſelves to be
ſonnes, yet ſee what God ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 2, 3, 4.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:152344:232"/>
Beſides, God ſaith, <hi>Some beleeved for a time,
and after fell away,</hi> Luk. 8. and that the <hi>Devils
beleeve,</hi> as <hi>James</hi> 2. Were theſe the ſonnes of
God; if no; then beleeving cannot make any
a ſon; ſons by ſaith in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. By faith is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
Chriſt; or by faith we know our ſelves
to be ſonnes; and by faith we appeare to be
ſonnes; faith and workes being inſeparable, in
any other ſenſe it cannot be extended, as I
have proved.</p>

light in it: in what Scripture may I reade this
diſtinction of the love of God; if not in any,
I beleeve it came out of the impure fountain,
<hi>viz.</hi> the blind Schoolmen. How this diſtinction
of love may ſute with man, I paſſe not, but to

<hi>Chriſt loved me, and gave himſelfe for me,</hi> Gal. 2.

                     <p>Forgiveneſſe of ſinne, conveyed to us by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
is called pardon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> It appeares from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 1, 2. That
their ſinnes were pardoned before it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
unto them; God cals it <hi>pardon,</hi> yet they
knew it not, nor had it in their conſciences;
<hi>Comfort ye my people; tell her that her iniquity is
pardoned.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Pardon of ſinne, or juſtification in the
conſcience, is not juſtification is ſelfe, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the knowledge of it; Juſtification depends
not upon our aſſurance of it, or knowledge of
it, but upon Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 25. It conſiſts in
taking away ſinne, that which is in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
is the knowledge of it, and comfort
of it.</p>
                     <p>1. That pardon of ſin or juſtification con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
not in the declaring of it, nor receiving
of it; for if to declare one to be juſt, makes
him ſo, then he was not ſo before, God and
wiſdome are ſaid to be juſtified by men, <hi>Mat.</hi>
11. 19. <hi>Luk. 7. 35. Rom.</hi> 3. 3, 4. did it make
him ſo?</p>
                     <p>2. God by his Spirit declareth a ſoule to
be juſt and righteous, but if he were not made
ſo by Chriſt before, it will follow, he juſtified
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:152344:242"/>
the wicked, which is abomination, <hi>Pro.</hi> 17. 15.
They are juſt, or wicked, guilty perſons or not
guilty, he ſaith, he will by no meanes cleare
the guilty, <hi>Exod 34. 7. Deut.</hi> 25. 1. Therefore
they that are righteous before, God will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
them to be ſo: God will not have men
to declare any to be juſt and righteous, unleſſe
they appeare to be ſo: The Elect are made
juſt by Chriſt, therefore they appeare ſo to
God, and in his time he declares it.</p>
                     <p>3. If to declare one to be juſt, could make
him ſo, it were good to doe it; for its good
to make evill good: if the wicked and their
actions were to be declared to be juſt, yet
would they remaine wicked and ſinfull ſtill.</p>
                     <p>1. Neither is Juſtification a taking ſin out
of the conſcience, if it were, faith juſtifieth
not, nor doth it take ſin out of the conſcience,
nor aſſure the conſcience that he is a childe of
God, for that is the worke of the holy Spirit
of God.</p>
                     <p>2. A man may feare the Lord, and obey
Chriſt, and yet walke in darkneſſe, and ſee no
light, and yet God is his God, <hi>Iſa</hi> 50. 10, 11.
If he be not a beleever, how doth it appeare
that God is his God: If ſin be taken out of his
conſcience, &amp; he aſſured that God is his God,
how doth he walke in darkneſſe, and ſee no
light? to ſee all Chriſt hath done to be for us,
and ſin taken out of the conſcience, which is
the fruit of the former, is a great light.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="127" facs="tcp:152344:242"/>
3. If the knowledge that a man is a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
takes away ſin, then faith takes it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
for it is one thing to beleeve, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to know I beleeve; as it is one thing to
ſee, and another to know I ſee: the latter is
by a reflection: by this reaſon it will follow,
that nothing juſtifieth, but the taking ſin out
of the conſcience, which is aſſurance; and</p>
                     <p>4. If aſſurance be juſtification, then a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever
may be an unjuſtified man, becauſe he
may want aſſurances, and be ſo clouded and
deſerted, that he may not injoy the aſſurance
of pardon, but very much doubt whether his
ſinnes be pardoned or no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>: thus it was with
<hi>Heman,</hi> Pſal. 88. and many other beleevers.</p>
                     <p>5. If juſtification conſiſts in taking ſin out
of the conſcience, it will follow, that if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
accuſe, he is an unjuſtified man, and ſo
be a juſtified and unjuſtified man in ten mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes;
for idle thoughts and words are ſins,
and conſcience will accuſe for them, and they
may lie heavy upon the conſcience.</p>
                     <p>6. Alſo by this reaſon it will follow, that
none are converted, nor have faith untill they
have aſſurance they appeare to be in their
ſinnes; no faith but aſſurance, yet aſſurance
is no faith at all, for they are two things,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 68, 69.</p>
                     <p>7. In placing pardon and Juſtification one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the conſcience, many of the children of
God, who injoy not aſſurance, but walke in
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:152344:243"/>
darkneſſe, in that reſpect are concluded to be
in ſin and unjuſtified, which is not onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable,
but contrary to the Scriptures,
and the Saints experience, its an error, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to affirme that men muſt beleeve, and be
aſſured of the remiſſion of ſinne, to the end
they may be remitted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14. By Perfect, is not meant pardon
of ſin, they were ſins, and after waſhed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> What then doth it meane, is not he
that is perfect without fault? did not Chriſt
by himſelfe purge our ſinnes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. Was
it not enough, and to purpoſe?</p>
                     <p>They alledge 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 9. &amp; 5. 18. Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

                     </p>

                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Its not I but ſin that dwelleth in me,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 20. If ſinne and a beleever be one,
how can he ſay, its not I, therefore I and ſin
are two things: we ſay, <hi>Whoſoever is borne of
God ſinneth not,</hi> and we doe ſinne, and have ſin,
if this be a contradiction, you know where we
had it.</p>
                     <p>O but, ſay they, Gods people cannot ſinne in Gods
account.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> We neither ſay ſo, nor thinke ſo, but
thinke and ſay the contrary; beleevers ſinne,
and they ſee it, therefore God much more,
and counts it as it is, ſin: alſo we ſay, there is
no condemnation to be inflicted on the Elect
for their ſinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. 33.</p>
                     <p>Your doctrine cauſeth men not to feele the ſenſe
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:152344:243"/>
of ſinne, and to cry to God for pardon, nor to know
the ſweetneſſe of pardon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> If by ſenſe of ſinne you meane the
horrour and terrour of it, we deſire not ſuch
a ſenſe of ſinne, nor wiſh it you, nor doe we
fetch our comfort from our ſenſe of ſinne, or
teares, or crying, nor our beſt workes, but
onely and alone from the love of God in the
death of Chriſt; we have made a Chriſt of our

                  </p>
                  <p>The maine difference lieth in the time of
Juſtification; I ſay it was when he ſhed his
bloud; others ſay it is when men beleeve:
he ſaith, it is not till the next world: I have
given my Reaſons from the Scripture, and
anſwered all the objections that I know are
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:152344:245"/>
made againſt this doctrine, with as much love
and tenderneſſe, as their expreſſions againſt
the truth would admit; and now I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
the truth, and pleaded for it in faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe,
love, plainneſſe, and ſingleneſſe of
heart, as in the ſight of God. Chriſt was called
<hi>a deceiver,</hi> Mat. 27. 63. Therefore I wonder
not if I be ſo called, yea and I expect it, and
that which Chriſt &amp; his followers in teaching
the truth, to meet with, which was, <hi>Some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved
the things that were ſpoken, and ſome belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not,</hi> Acts 28. 24.</p>
                  <p>I paſſe not if any condemne me, ſo they
do not condemne Chriſt and his truth, ſeeing
all ſhall worke for good, therefore I am ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in committing all to God.</p>
                  <p>And concerning the doubt which doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe
in many concerning Communion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we may have Communion in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the Supper with ſuch as hold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to this truth ſo much contented for, I
anſwer to the queſtion, whether we may walke
in communion with thoſe that deny this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <hi>Can two walke together unleſſe they be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed,</hi>
Amos 3. 3.</p>
                  <p>The Saints cannot walke together warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably,
and ſo not comfortably, without theſe
two things.</p>
                  <p>1. An oneneſſe of faith in the principles
or doctrine of Chriſt, knowne, owned, and
declared.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:152344:245"/>
2. Love to the truth, and to each other,
ſo as to deſire to walke together.</p>
                  <p>For my part, I would not joyne to that
Church, who denied any foundation-truth,
and this is one; but being joyned, if the
Church doe not den<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> it, I am not to deny
communion with thoſe that deny it, untill
ſufficient meanes hath been uſed to informe
them: it appeares to me, there is a neceſſitie
to part in any of theſe cauſes following; as,</p>
                  <p>1. If the ſtaffe of beauty is broke, <hi>Zach.</hi> 11.
10. Faith and Order, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
                  <p>2. Or the ſtaffe of bands is broke, <hi>Zach.</hi> 11.
14. Love ſo broke, ſo as each deſires to part.</p>
                  <p>3. Or the brotherhood ſo broke, that the
Church, the Candleſticke is removed one part
from another, that we cannot performe our
duty one to another, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 5. with 1. 10.</p>
                  <p>4. Or many depart from the faith.</p>
                  <p>5. Or the worſt over power the beſt, that
offenders cannot be caſt out.</p>
                  <p>6. Or cannot agree about the doctrine and
diſcipline in the Scriptures for the Church,
when our ſtaying cannot reclaime the reſt,
then can we not with honour to the truth,
nor with comfort and peace of conſcience,
walke together. Such as love the Lord, who
are of one minde and heart, in the principles
of truth, are to cleave to the truth, and each
to other, as <hi>Jer</hi> 50. 5. Onely let each ſoule
conſider well that his grounds be full and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:152344:246"/>
cleare; let not any thing be done in ſtrife, nor
paſſion, but in love to the truth and them:
The Lord helpe and direct us all to know his
will, and to doe it.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Ordinances of Chriſt, many
ſhall ſlight them, and depart from the faith,
and the practiſe of them, and pretend want
of Apoſtles, and of men to worke miracles:
that all that did baptize, did worke miracles,
cannot be proved, but the contrary appeares.
<hi>John</hi> did baptize, yet he did no miracle, (nor
<hi>Apollo,</hi> Acts 19.) <hi>Joh. 10. 41. He that is leaſt in
the kingdome of God is greater then he;</hi> therefore
a preaching Diſciple may baptize as well as
he. The Scripture doth not declare, that he
that baptizeth muſt work miracles, &amp;c. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it may not be reſtrained to ſuch; conſider
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. to 14. The gifts of the Spirit are
in nature one, though diverſe in operation;
therefore of equall authority, and ſo to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
by us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7, 8, 9. 24.</p>
                  <p>He that is baptized by any of the gifts of
the Spirit, is baptized by the ſame Spirit;
we are baptized by one Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3.
He ſaith not by the gifts of miracles; ſee <hi>verſ.</hi>
28, 29, 30.</p>
                  <p>If God workes in all the operations of the
Spirit, the baptiſme by one gift of it is to be
acknowledged the baptiſme of the ſame God:
the firſt is true, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 6. therefore the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is true alſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:152344:246"/>
To tie Baptiſme to ſome of the gifts of the
Spirit, and not to the reſt, is to diſhonour the
Spirit, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 23, 24. This in effect was
the <hi>Corinths</hi> ſin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 26. The ceaſing of
the gifts of tongues and miracles might be,
becauſe they might not be idolized above the
other.</p>
                  <p>If the Apoſtles did baptize, becauſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
then might they baptize, though they
had not the gifts of miracles, &amp;c. for it is one
thing to be an Apoſtle, and another to worke
miracles, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28, 29, 30. Gifts are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to men ſeverally as he will, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 11.
The Diſciples were not Apoſtles when they
baptized, <hi>Joh. 3. 22, 23, 24. &amp;</hi> 4. 2. At that
time Chriſt had no Apoſtles, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1. 14. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>John</hi> was caſt into priſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>verſ. 16. Simon</hi>
and <hi>Andrew</hi> his brother were converted, and
that <hi>Simon</hi> &amp; <hi>Andrew</hi> were the firſt Apoſtles,
appeares, <hi>Mat. 10. 2. Luk.</hi> 13, 14, 15. Whence
it will follow, that one that is not an Apoſtle,
nor a worker of miracles may baptize.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj. Apollo</hi> conferred the gifts of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
by laying on of hands, becauſe its a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
in Religion, and he baptized not till he
had learned the principles of Religion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.
2. <hi>Anſ.</hi> It doth not follow, becauſe it is one
thing to underſtand the principles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and another to conferre the gifts of the
Spirit, by laying on of hands: as its one thing
to underſtand, to beleeve the Reſurrection of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:152344:247"/>
the dead, &amp;c. and another thing to raiſe the
dead. Which holds forth moſt of Gods wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
&amp; love: to ſay the Ordinances of Chriſt
are not neceſſary, or cannot be had; or to ſay
they are uſefull, and God hath appointed a
way and meanes for ſuch as beleeve to come
by them, and injoy them. Therefore as in
<hi>Moſes</hi> time the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,
yet obedience was required of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ages, who ſaw no miracles: So in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
dayes there were miracles, yet obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is required of thoſe who now beleeve,
although we ſee not ſuch miracles. Its fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
that Antichriſt ſhall come with ſignes
and wonders, as <hi>Mat. 24. 23, 24. &amp; 2 Theſ.</hi> 2.
9, 10. Chriſt is not to come in this way, yet
many, except they ſee ſignes &amp; wonders, they
will not beleeve, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 48.</p>
                  <p>Preaching and Baptiſme are to continue to
the end of the world; as appeares, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.
19, 20. And breaking of bread untill he come,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. And gifts to teach until he come,
<hi>Luk 19. 13. 1 Cor.</hi> 14. 3. So all things delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unto the Saints are to be held faſt till he
come, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 25, 16.</p>
