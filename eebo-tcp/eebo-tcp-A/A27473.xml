            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Cenſure of Malice, that Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which ſhe us'd in ſo nice a Cauſe, in which meer Chance and her own Misfortune had involv'd her.

makes me hope the ſame Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour for this, I have now more need of your Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction than ever: I compoſe the Hiſtory of a Man, who is ſo Generous to yield his Miſtreſs to his Rival, and now there being but few Men capable of ſuch great Things, and that Perſons are rarely mov'd but with ſuch things towards which they have ſome diſpoſition, I have cauſe to fear the ſucceſs of this Book. But, Madam, great and lofty Sentiments are met with in Royal Souls. Above all,
<pb facs="tcp:66339:5"/>
they are in yours in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative, and peradventure in that reſpect the Count <hi>D'Amboiſe</hi> may pleaſe you.

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT has been obſerv'd, that in my firſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel there were ſome places in which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was not well enough copied, and that partak'd more of Conception than of Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Though I am not aſham'd of that Reproach, I have however endeavour'd on the Remarks that have been made me, to carry ſo far my Inſpections, as to mark the difference of a real Paſſion, from that which is but an over-ſtudied Idea of it. And I hope that this Hiſtory will be found more natural than the other in the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It will alſo be found more extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary in the Action; and I believe not that it is a defect; for though that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of an ordinary Guſto, are accuſtomed to fanſie every thing ridiculous that is not common, great Wits find a diſguſt in things that are mean and low. They fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
<pb facs="tcp:66339:7"/>
always to ſee the ſame Romance, becauſe they always meet with the ſame ſtrokes. I flatter my ſelf, that this Turn has not yet been ſeen; and I have not any thing at all to fear, except that it is not very likely a Lover ſhould be generous. Thoſe Diſcourſes which are daily made of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, gives place to this Scruple; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all it is but a Scruple, on which I paſs in favour of that which is great in the Idea. Peradventure that ſome may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that I reward not the Count of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boiſe</hi>'s Vertue, but I deſign to puniſh his Paſſion, I have already declar'd in the Preface of <hi>Elenor of Yvrée,</hi> that my deſign was to repreſent none but unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Loves, that I may combate as much as in me lyes, that tendency which we have for that Paſſion.</p>

            <head>THE Count of <hi>Amboiſe.</hi> A NOVEL. PART I.</head>
            <p>THE Reign of <hi>Francis</hi> the Second appear'd in its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning very agreeable and happy. The Queen his Wife, was one of the moſt beautiful and moſt ingenious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66339:8"/>
in the World. His Court was compos'd of part of thoſe Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſons that had form'd that of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies had as great ſhares of Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as the Men had of Valour. The Count of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> and the Marqueſs of <hi>Sanſac</hi> did diſtinguiſh themſelves in it. Their Families had always been of oppoſite In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts; and though they were not declared Enemies, they had a certain Emulation which ſeem'd to have ſome Conſequences de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending. They were both equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well made, nothing could be diſputable in the one, but by the other; and it verily ſeem'd as if they were to conteſt all things betwixt them.</p>
            <p>The Counteſs of <hi>Roye</hi> being a Widow, had retired her ſolf at two Leagues diſtance from <hi>Paris</hi> to a Country-houſe, where ſhe receiv'd no Viſits but from ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66339:8"/>
Friends. She had a Daughter perfectly beautiful, who had not yet appear'd. She did deſign to marry her before bringing of her to Court, and ſhe made choice of the Count of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all thoſe that were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to her. That Marriage, which was equally advantageous to him and to Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> was concluded on, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had had an Enterview; but ſhe having the Repute of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great Beauty, Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> did flatter himſelf very much with the thoughts that ſhe ſhould be his; and it may be ſaid, That deſires and hope did already form in his Heart the beginnings of a Paſſion, before he had ſeen its Object.</p>
            <p>Though Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> might have been poſſeſt with that kind of inſenſibility, which Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude uſually gives, the quickneſs
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66339:9"/>
of her Apprehenſion did make her to recieve and entertain the firſt impreſſions that were given her, and what ſhe heard her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay of the Count's good Meen, Wit, and Generoſity, did create in her an Eſteem, which diſpos'd her towards the receptions of far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impreſſions.</p>
            <p>That day in which he was to give her the firſt Viſit, ſhe had dreſs'd her ſelf with more care than uſually, and ſhe was of a Beauty to charm all thoſe that beheld her. It was in one of thoſe agreeable Summers days that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite to take the Air. The Sun that had not appear'd that day, gave place to a delicious Coolneſs; and Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> was walking in one of the Avenues of the Houſe with two Ladies of her Mother's acquaintance, who were come to dine with her. It being early enough yet not to expect
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66339:9"/>
the Count of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> and Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> was buſied about ſome Conſerves, ſhe was well pleas'd that the Walk did divert them during that time which ſhe was to employ in buſineſs. They were already come to the end of a Walk, where there was an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour open on every ſide, very pleaſant, and in which they were going to enter to ſeat themſelves, when they perceiv'd a Cavaleer, who alighting from his Horſe, left his Followers behind him, and advanc'd towards them. Still as he approach'd, ſhe obſerv'd his ſhape and Air, which appear'd worthy of all the attention that ſhe afforded them. She doubted not but that it was Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> he came at the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed day, his earneſtneſs could not diſpleaſe her. The good Meen of that Perſon that ſhe ſaw, did cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond to that Idea which ſhe had
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66339:10"/>
fram'd in her ſelf of the Count. Thoſe Ladies that were with her did not know him, as belonging not to the Court. They had learnt that he was expected that day, and they alſo were of opinion that it was he. They beſtowed Praiſes on him, which added the more to prepoſſeſs her in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</p>
            <p>Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> found her duty very eaſie, and it may be that ſhe haſtned her ſelf a little too much to obſerve it; Monſieur <hi>Amboiſe</hi> was the Perſon that was to inſpire her with that Joy which is given at the firſt encounter of that Object which ought to pleaſe; but it was in favour of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Sanſac</hi> that ſhe had been made ſenſible of it. Chance had conducted him there, he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a Lady of his Relation, and having found himſelf near to Madam of <hi>Roye</hi>'s Houſe, ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66339:10"/>
which he had heard of her Daughter's Beauty, did make him take that occaſion to give them a Viſit. He had not ſeen Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> ſince the death of her Husband; ſhe liv'd in ſo cloſe a Retirement, that none had yet attempted to diſturb her; but he thought that after a year of Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſhe would make no ſcruple of receiving him.</p>
            <p>He approacht the Ladies, and though he knew them not, he ſaid all that Politeneſs and Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try could inſpire him with in that rencontre, but he preſently did diſtinguiſh Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> from the reſt; of truth, though one of them was young, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful alſo, the Beauty of Madmoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> was ſo perfect, that one could not behold any other but hers, in any place where ſhe appear'd; ſhe found I know not what of pleaſing in this Adventure,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66339:11"/>
which gave her an inclination to continue it. She intreated the Ladies not to tell her Name, and knowing that thoſe Concerns, which detain'd her Mother, would not be ſo ſoon ended, ſhe propos'd to the Company to go ſeat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Arbour.</p>
            <p>That Road which the Marqueſs of <hi>Sanſac</hi> had taken, would not let him doubt but that it led to Madam of <hi>Roye</hi>'s; he went not about to conceal that deſign, and thoſe Ladies confirming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the opinion, that he was Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> did put di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers nice Queſtions to him on Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi>'s account, which gave him to underſtand, that they took him for that Count, who he knew to be on the very point of marrying her. They ask'd him, whether he had not wherewith to accuſe himſelf for amuſing with them, when he was
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66339:11"/>
on the point of ſeeing ſo beautiful a Perſon. She bluſh'd at this, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a manner which helpt to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him, that he was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in the thoughts that ſhe was Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The place where he met with her, and her extraordinay Beauty, had already given him great ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions of it; but then he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it no longer, and gueſt by what was told him, that ſhe had not yet ſeen the Count of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> and that he was expected. The Adventure pleas'd him in his turn, that Errour caus'd him to be favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably look'd upon by a beautiful Perſon, he took upon him not to anſwer poſitively, that he might not undeceive them, and to take off all blame from him, when they ſhould come to know him. <hi>There cannot be had a greater Idea of Madmoiſelle of</hi> Roye's <hi>Beauty, than I have,</hi> ſaid he; <hi>Yet it is hard for</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:66339:12"/>
               <hi>me to believe that ſhe is above that which I ſee here,</hi> added he, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on her in a manner which did perſwade her that he was taken. She took a moſt ſenſible delight in all that paſs'd there, and was highly pleas'd with the ſudden ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of her Charms, in a manner which ſtill conduc'd to render her favourable unto him, who gave her to underſtand that he was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their Power. They had already been an hour in that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, when a great ſhowre of Rain beſieg'd them. No body was ſorry for it, the Converſation was ſo pleaſing, that it was not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them to compute the time that they ſtay'd there. Monſieur of <hi>Sanſac</hi> had an incomparable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement in his Perſon, and in all that he ſaid, and his natural Briskneſs was the more heightned by all that was of ſurpriſing in that rencounter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:66339:12"/>Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſht to find him ſo worthy of her, their Eyes met more than once after a manner which caus'd her to bluſh, and which afterwards made her to avoid thoſe of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur of <hi>Sanſac.</hi> Of truth, though ſhe believ'd him to be the Count of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> and that ſhe was to marry him, ſhe was ſenſible of I know not what that was indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant of her Duty, which ſhe was loth to unravel. She had all the leiſure to abandon her ſelf to an Errour, which was to prove ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to her in the purſuit: for the ſtorm did not ceaſe, and they could not ſtir out of the Arbour. At laſt Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> came, and perceiving Ladies in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, he went towards it, taking them to be Madam and Madmoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle of <hi>Roye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He found not there that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs which he had ſeen at Court;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66339:13"/>
but he preſently knew her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the Picture that had been made him of her, and on the ſame grounds which had before given the Marqueſs of <hi>Sanſac</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that it was ſhe; ſo that he addreſs'd his Compliments to her. Yet conſidering that he might be miſtaken, and the preſence of ſo many Perſons retaining him, he advanc'd nothing which could preciſely mark that he was the Perſon which they expected.</p>
            <p>He deſerv'd no leſs than the Marqueſs of <hi>Sanſac</hi> to entertain that Company, an agreeable ſhape above the common, a noble Air, I know not what of fine and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate, did render him moſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of pleaſing. The Ladies did him all the Juſtice which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd; but Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> was troubled to be conſtrain'd to doubt which of the two was her Lover: She looked on both of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66339:13"/>
them, as if to ask which it was that ſhe was oblig'd to love, but it was with a certain difference, which ſeem'd to mark that ſhe would gladly have had him to be Monſieur of <hi>Sanſac.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Eldeſt of the Ladies, who perceiv'd the conſuſion in which that young Perſon was, thought fit to cauſe it to ceaſe. Madam of <hi>Roye</hi>'s Women having been forc'd to retire into the Arbour alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Rain, ſhe ſent one of them to ask the Name of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> from his people, and having learnt it, ſhe had Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> inform'd of it.</p>
            <p>That young Lady could not forbear looking on him with more coldneſs than ſhe naturally ought to have had. The briskneſs of the Converſation had enlivened her Face, and increas'd her Beauty; Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> did conſider her with the intereſt of a man
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:66339:14"/>
for whom ſhe was deſign'd; and in ſpight of that Idea, which he had conceiv'd of her, he ſtill found occaſion of being ſurpris'd; but the manner with which ſhe receiv'd him, did not afford him a reliſh of thoſe Charms which the birth of a Paſſion uſually excites in the Heart, and Love did even deny him that very firſt ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>She beheld Monſieur of <hi>Sanſac</hi> without reflecting on it with leſs Caution than before, as if ſhe had bid him Adieu with that Look, and that ſhe were become more bold when ſhe was to deveſt her ſelf of all Hopes, than ſhe had been a moment before, when ſhe thought that ſhe might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd the ſame in him.</p>
            <p>Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> had his Eyes too much fix'd upon Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> not to follow hers; it may alſo be, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66339:14"/>
oppoſition of <hi>Sanſac</hi> and he; did promote his fears; in fine, he miſtruſted part of the truth.</p>
            <p>The ſtorm ſtill continu'd, and Madam of <hi>Roye,</hi> who had made an end of thoſe buſineſſes, which had detained her, came to fetch them in her Coach. She did not expect to find the Marqueſs of <hi>Sanſac</hi> there: However ſhe was not backwards in ſhewing him much reſpect. That Counteſs ſet forth to Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> all the Eſteem which ſhe had for his Merit, and the joy ſhe was in to ſee him; but thoſe Civilities di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted him not from that diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Idea which he had taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Will.</p>
            <p>Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> did lead them into her Apartment, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers agitations which disjoynted that Company, created in it ſome kind of uneaſieneſs. The Count of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> who naturally lov'd
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66339:15"/>
not <hi>Sanſac,</hi> did think that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs's Viſit too long. It want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not much of Monſieur of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac</hi>'s thinking the ſame of the Count of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> though he was not ignorant of the deſign that brought him, but at laſt he was forc'd to quit the place to him.</p>
            <p>The Ladies departed alſo, and the Count of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the laſt. He inform'd Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> how much the advantage of being deſign'd for her did charm him; but he told her at the ſame time, that if he was not ſo happy as to touch her Heart, he found himſelf in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition much to be pitied. Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> made anſwer, that ſhe had no Heart to give, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Duty to follow. The Air with which ſhe pronounc'd thoſe words, was not proper to give Hopes to a Lover. She took lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle care of keeping up the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:66339:15"/>
but ſhe ſhew'd enough of Wit to finiſh that which her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had began, and to create diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties enough to the poſſeſſion of her Heart, to render the Count's Paſſion most ardent from that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day.</p>
            <p>When Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> was alone, ſhe remain'd in a profound ſtudy, and though ſhe did not yet unravel her Sentiments as to Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> and Monſieur of <hi>Sanſac,</hi> ſhe however fancied this laſt to be the moſt amiable.</p>
            <p>For his part, he had been ſtruck with Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi>'s Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He had obſerv'd, that his Converſation did not diſpleaſe her, and that ſhe had receiv'd the Count of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> with ſome coldneſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that he carried none but agreeable and pleaſing Ideas back with him.</p>
            <p>He ſpoke of her at Court with ſuch great Elogies, that the Queen
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66339:16"/>
grew impatient to ſee her, and he having learn'd from Madam of <hi>Roye,</hi> that they ſhould not return ſo ſoon from the Country, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the Queen thereof, who ſeem'd to be ſorry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sanſac,</hi> who wanted but ſome pretence to return to Madam of <hi>Roye,</hi> oblig'd himſelf in going to inform her of the Queen's thoughts: He did ſee Madmoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> a ſecond time, he fancied that he diſcern'd ſome ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in her Eyes; he ſaid a thouſand things to her, which thoſe diſpoſitions, in which ſhe was towards him, did make her eaſily to apprehend, and that at the ſame time could not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to Madam of <hi>Roye.</hi> The Count of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> who had right to viſit them often, came in the time that Monſieur of <hi>Sanſac</hi> was retiring. A ſecond Viſit of that Marqueſs did trouble him. His
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66339:16"/>
diſturbance which diſcover'd it ſelf to Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> caus'd her to fancy him whimſical, which made an end of loſing him in her Eſteem.</p>
            <p>She felt in her ſelf an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency for him, before ſhe knew that <hi>Sanſac</hi> was the Cauſe of it. Thoſe Cares which the Count did render her, grew uneaſie, and preſently gave her an averſion towards him, which ſhe oppos'd in vain. Any man for whom one is oblig'd to have ſome regard, does always make himſelf hated, when he cauſes not himſelf to be belov'd.</p>
            <p>The Count of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> did eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive that Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> lov'd him not, he mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſted the Cauſe of it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Cuſtom of unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Lovers, he ſought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himſelf more particularly of that knowledge, of which he had
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:66339:17"/>
not ſufficiency enough yet to make him entirely miſerable.</p>
            <p>One day that the King was walking, follow'd by the whole Court; this Count perceiving that <hi>Sanſac</hi> was at ſome diſtance from the Crowd, drew near him to ſpeak of Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye.</hi> But though they both had equal deſires, neither of them could reſolve to begin. At laſt, <hi>Amboiſe</hi> followed his deſign, he prais'd her highly, and <hi>Sanſac</hi> ſaid but little, as much it might be, not to be of his Rival's opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as for fear of diſcovering his Love. Mean time the Count of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> was not in a condition of receiving any ſatisfaction, he had been uneaſie, if the Marqueſs of <hi>Sanſac</hi> had too much admired Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> and he was ſo likewiſe, becauſe he would not praiſe her ſufficiently.</p>
            <p>Few hours after his Jealouſie
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66339:17"/>
was entirely confirm'd. That night, at the King's Apartment, the Converſation being fallen on the Beauty of ſome Ladies of the Court, the Marqueſs of <hi>Sanſac,</hi> who was no longer reſtrain'd by the preſence of Monſieur of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boiſe,</hi> could not forbear praiſing highly Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi>'s Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he was ſpeaking of it with great Tranſport when the Count came in. The King perceiving him at diſtance, <hi>Here's Sanſac,</hi> ſaid he to him, raiſing his voice, <hi>who ſays more wonderful things of Madmoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle of</hi> Roye's <hi>Beauty, than you ever told us.</hi> Theſe two Rivals bluſh'd at thoſe words: that redneſs was obſerv'd; they were play'd upon for it the reſt of that night, and they had occaſion of all their Wit to oppoſe the Raille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, they both knew more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in that occaſion, what ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them had of Parts, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66339:18"/>
they eſteem'd each other, but to hate the more.</p>
            <p>The Count of <hi>Sanſac,</hi> Father to the Marqueſs, had ſome thoughts to marry his Son to Madmoiſelle of <hi>Anebault,</hi> whoſe Beauty might have rendred happy a man that had not lov'd Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye;</hi> he durſt not oppoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf openly to his Father's Will, but he retarded that Marriage, and he had a great repugnancy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> at that time did bring her Daughter to Court, where ſhe receiv'd all the Applauſe that ſhe merited.</p>
            <p>She gain'd both Lovers and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. The Counteſs of <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> was of the number of thoſe to whom her Beauty caus'd ſome diſcontent, and who did the beſt diſſemble it. The Count of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerre</hi> did find her perfectly love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but durſt not own that he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her, becauſe he did not ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66339:18"/>
that Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> could be hated. Soon after, he took a Journey, which helpt him to conceal his Paſſion, but not to cure it.</p>
            <p>Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> ſtay'd not long without knowing that the Marqueſs of <hi>Sanſac</hi> was to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to Madmoiſelle of <hi>Anebault;</hi> ſhe was ſurpris'd at this News, and much more to find her ſelf ſo concern'd at it againſt her Will. She apply'd her ſelf coward that Lady about it, and to find defects in him.</p>
            <p>Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi>'s Marriage was on the point of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, when that there happen'd ſome difficulties in it, which had not been foreſeen. The King had ſome knowledge of an Inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Prince of. <hi>Conde</hi> was promoting in the Kingdom, and becauſe the Count was particularly linkt to him, it was believ'd that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66339:19"/>
he had a hand in it, though there was no proof againſt him, it was ſufficient that there were ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſts to have a ſtrict Watch kept on his Actions. There was no Policy to let him marry a Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> before his Conduct were clear'd.</p>
            <p>Divers things paſs'd during that Retardment, Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> not knowing any thing of <hi>Sanſac</hi>'s Sentiments towards her Daughter, did receive him, as ſhe did other Perſons of the Court. Her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did inform her ſelf with too much care about the Marriage of Madmoiſelle of <hi>Anebault,</hi> to be ignorant of the reſiſtance that he made againſt it, and it was not difficult for her to find that ſhe had more than ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns in it. That Intereſt which ſhe had for all the Actions of that Marqueſs, did every moment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm her in an opinion, that ſhe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66339:19"/>
had made him ſenſible. She did follow that tendency with ſome ſcruple, but ſtill ſhe follow'd it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sanſac</hi> did every day obſerve ſome little effects of Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi>'s paſſion, which charm'd him; mean time, in thoſe Terms that ſhe was with Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> he durſt not ſpeak open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to her, for fear of loſing thoſe marks of her tenderneſs, if he ſhould force her to unravel them; but he intruſted Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac</hi> his Siſter, with the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which he had for Madmoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> and he intreated her to contract, if ſhe could, a ſtrict Friendſhip with her, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to deſtroy Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> in her opinion, that the Count's Marriage, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready retarded through Policy, might be ſo likewiſe by that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency which ſhe might have for him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:66339:20"/>Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac</hi> was at firſt troubled in being oblig'd to render ſome ill Offices to a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for whom ſhe had a ſingular Eſteem; but that very Eſteem did inſenſibly lead her to act againſt his Marriage: She being very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious, and Siſter to <hi>Sanſac,</hi> it was not difficult for her to enter into a very cloſe Commerce of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> who did not conceal from her the ſorrow ſhe was to ſee her ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for an Husband, for whom ſhe had ſo little inclination. She would do Juſtice to his good Parts and Qualities, but it was with a kind of reſervedneſs. His Merit was a kind of ſecret Reproach to her of that indifferency ſhe had for him; She hated him becauſe he lov'd her, and becauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to be belov'd.</p>
            <p>Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac,</hi> who was Maid of Honour to the Queen, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66339:20"/>
who was the beſt treated by her, offer'd her all her Services to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that Princeſs, to bring her to ſpeak to Madam of <hi>Roye,</hi> that that Marriage might be broke off. Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> who fear'd diſpleaſing of her Mother, did at firſt oppoſe it with ſome earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yet ſhe gave her opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſee, that if the thing could have been done without concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf in it, ſhe had been pleas'd at it.</p>
            <p>There needed no more to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac</hi> to ſerve her. She was to go to the Spaw-Waters for her Health, and ſhe would, before ſhe took her Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, mention it to the Queen, not to loſe any time in obliging her Friend. Though Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> was far from owning to her the inclination that ſhe had for her Brother, it was much that ſhe forbore ſpeaking of him at all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:66339:21"/>The Count of <hi>Amboiſe</hi>'s hatred to <hi>Sanſac,</hi> did increaſe extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily. Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to her ſelf, did afford to this laſt ſome marks of a moſt particular Eſteem, which could not eſcape a Lover's penetration; and he would ſometimes wave on the deliberation of what Party he ſhould take. It was unpleaſing to him to marry a Perſon who was prepoſſeſt by an inclination for another Perſon; Reaſon did oppoſe it ſelf to that deſign, but ſtill he was in Love. How was it poſſible to loſe the hopes of ſeeing her his own? After divers irreſolutions, he perceiv'd that he was not capable of fixing on any thing.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſs of <hi>Sanſac</hi> did ſhew ſo much indifferency for Madmoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle of <hi>Annebault,</hi> that ſhe her ſelf endeavour'd to avoid the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of him, ſo that that Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:66339:21"/>
was broke off. Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> conceiv'd ſo great a Joy at it, that ſhe was not able to conceal it from Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac,</hi> unto whom her motions were not indifferent. She did frequently ſee the Count of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boiſe</hi> at that Friend's houſe. She had found him as lovely as unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, and inſenſibly pity had led her into other Sentiments She ſtill engag'd her ſelf more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in her Brothers Intereſts, and ſhe did even think that in ſome meaſure ſhe did ſerve Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> in preventing him from marrying a Perſon that hated him.</p>
            <p>The Count of <hi>Sanſac</hi> her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was mov'd by her to deſire that his Son might marry Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> which was not thought a difficult matter in the preſent Juncture. The Family of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> had never manag'd the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:66339:22"/>
               <hi>Sanſancs</hi> in any occaſion. The <hi>Sanſacs,</hi> whom Favour emboldned, had frequently ſought after ſome means to diſpleaſe them, ſo that nothing did detain them, and Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> was ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable a Party, that they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to have ſome body ſpeak about it to Madam of <hi>Roye;</hi> at firſt they required but a Prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, in caſe that Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi>'s Marriage was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the Queen to enter into this buſineſs. That Princeſs did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſhe would, and Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac</hi> went to the Spaw. After that Promiſe had been obtain'd, the Queen was not long before ſhe kept her Word; ſhe made ſome Propoſitions to Madam of <hi>Roye.</hi> She gave her to conceive, that Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi>'s adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> did render him ſtill ſuſpected, and

that there were more advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Parties to be had through the King's Favour and Friendſhip; but Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> was one of thoſe exact Women that keep their words. The Count's good Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities had given her a Friendſhip for him, which was increas'd by his misfortune.

            <p>The Queen, who endeavoured to oblige Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac,</hi> did preſs Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> more home ſtill, and omitted nothing of that which could favour the <hi>Sanſacs;</hi> at laſt ſhe deſir'd her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe for the Marqueſs, in caſe ſhe ſhould break off with the Count of <hi>Amboiſe.</hi> Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> was uneaſie at the Propoſitions <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

they would have her conſent to, at the time that ſhe was ingag'd with a man whom they lov'd not, which appear'd, in that they ſo ſoon ſeiz'd on an occaſion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult on his diſgrace. She told the Queen that ſhe was ſtrangely trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that ſhe could not promiſe her any thing on that account, becauſe that her Daughter had ſome Antipathy againſt the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Sanſac;</hi> not that ſhe did really believe any ſuch thing, but to draw her ſelf out of that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom buſineſs.</p>
            <p>That ill ſucceſs did put <hi>Sanſac</hi> into a ſtrange Chagrin and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; Though Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi>'s Looks had divers times aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd him that he was not hated, he durſt no longer truſt to them. In fine, he was certain of Madam of <hi>Roy</hi>'s hatred, though he might ſtill remain in doubt of that of her Daughter, and he began to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:66339:23"/>
loſe the hope of ever being hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.</p>
            <p>Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that young Perſon of what had paſs'd, not to divert her from thoſe Sentiments which ſhe ought to have for the Count of <hi>Amboiſe.</hi> She alſo thought fit that he ſhould be ignorant of it, for fear that at this time that he was not look'd upon favourably at Court, he ſhould come to ſome unfortunate extremities with a man whom the King lov'd. The next day ſhe brought back her Daughter into the Country, to an Houſe at a further diſtance than the former, in expectation of ſome Change in the Count's Affairs, unto whom ſhe ſhew'd that the Air of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace in which he was, ſhould bring no alteration unto thoſe Sentiments that ſhe had for him.</p>
            <p>But what did thoſe Sentiments avail to the Count of <hi>Amboiſe?</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:66339:24"/>
He was almoſt certain, that his Miſtreſſes were contrary to him. He reſolv'd to ſatisfie himſelf in that Point, and to bring it about, ſo that Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> ſhould find her ſelf engag'd by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, or by her own intereſt, to confeſs a thing, of which the very ſuſpicion appear'd ſo fatal to him, that the very Certainty it ſelf could not be more. If Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> was prepoſſeſt with another inclination, it were better for him to be once aſſur'd of it, than to remain continually in fear. Mean time he had ſome occaſions to inform himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but he had not the power of making uſe of it; and when he was on the point of being ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he would avoid it.</p>
            <p>Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> did ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly return into the Country, that <hi>Sanſac</hi> could not get an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſpeaking to her. The

               </gap> him; he was netled with thoſe words that Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> had ſaid to the Queen, and Love join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Spight, did put him on find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out all manner of means to clear the buſineſs. Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac</hi> was too far diſtant to ſerve him towards Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye.</hi> He caſt his Eyes on Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam of <hi>Tournon;</hi> ſhe was the moſt ſubtle and the moſt inſinuating of all Women. She had found out the way of gaining Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roy</hi>'s Eſteem and Friendſhip, and they had always been in a ſtrait conjunction. Monſieur of <hi>Sanſac</hi> thought that he might go to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam of <hi>Roye</hi> with her, and that he ſhould find ſome means of ſpeaking to Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye.</hi> He gave Madam of <hi>Tournon</hi> divers Viſits, which ſhe receiv'd with great ſatisfaction. Though ſhe was
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:66339:25"/>
not in the very prime of her youth, ſhe was ſtill lovely enough to flatter her ſelf of being belov'd; and the Count of <hi>Tournon,</hi> whoſe Widow ſhe was, had left her ſuch conſiderable means, that the thoughts of being able to make that Marqueſs a vaſt Fortune, did aſſiſt her in ſeducing of her ſelf in his behalf.</p>
            <p>She might have gueſt, that thoſe Civilities which he rendred her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had not the right ſtamp of Love upon them; but Perſons are apt to miſtake in ſuch Niceties. That application which uſually is brought in ſuch examination, is almoſt a certain way of miſtake. That made Madam of <hi>Tournon</hi> to give unto all <hi>Sanſac</hi>'s actions, that ſenſe which beſt agreed with thoſe Sentiments that ſhe entertain'd for him.</p>
            <p>But ſhe did not enjoy her Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour long; he left her the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:66339:25"/>
leiſure of making diſtinct Reflections; ſhe perceiv'd the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of his proceedings with hers. Finally, he having but ſmall application unto the Counteſs's actions, and fancying that they proceeded but from Friendſhip, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he felt no more within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for her; after ſome days were paſs'd, he propos'd to go along with her to Madam of <hi>Roye.</hi> That Propoſition caus'd Madam of <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> to open her Eyes, and ſhe reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſatisfied that he was in Love with Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> after he had once mention'd that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Perſon's Name. The ſhame of having deceiv'd her ſelf, the ſorrow to love in vain, and the ſpight to ſee Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> whom ſhe hated, to triumph over her, could not reſt without ſome effects in Madam of <hi>Tournon's</hi> Heart; mean time her natural diſſimultation did prevent her from
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:66339:26"/>
flying out. She promis'd him to make up that match which he propos'd; but ſhe had already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, that Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> had ſome unkindneſs for the <hi>Sanſacs.</hi> She writ to her, that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs had intreated her to bring him to her. Madam of <hi>Roye,</hi> who after the Propoſitions that had been made, and what ſhe had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Queen, finding that ſhe ſhould be perplext with that Viſit, preſently anſwer'd Madam of <hi>Tournon,</hi> and did engage her to divert <hi>Sanſac</hi> from that Deſign. Madam of <hi>Tournon,</hi> who in writing to Madam of <hi>Roye,</hi> had had no other deſign but of getting ſuch a kind of Anſwer, ſhew'd the Letter to <hi>Sanſac,</hi> as to a Friend from whom ſhe had no Secret to conceal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sanſac,</hi> who this ill Succeſs had diſguſted, conſulted no longer the Counteſs on a thing of w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> it was nor ſeaſonable to diſcover the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, he did go to Madam of <hi>Roye,</hi>

but he ſaw not her Daughter, though he enquired after her. He was told, that ſhe was ill; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd there a ſecond time, and he was again refus'd ſeeing of her, on pretences which appear'd very unlikely to him. He learnt that Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> was with her, inſomuch that aſham'd of the ſmall ſucceſs of his Viſits, and deſpairing for having a Rival more happy than himſelf, he took the reſolution of leaving <hi>Paris,</hi> and went to one of his Houſes at a great diſtance from thence.</p>
            <p>Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> who had been all along concern'd at the precipitation with which ſhe had been hurried into the Country, and who ſaw with ſorrow that ſhe was prevented from receiving Viſits from <hi>Sanſac,</hi> did fancy that peradventure Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> had diſcover'd her Sentiments towards him, which produc'd in her a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſhame and trouble.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:66339:27"/>Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> did let her obſerve how much he was afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee her in that melancholy, yet without complaining, and without giving her the leaſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that he could in part read her mind; ſo reſpectful a Conduct did touch Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> and Pity ſucceeded to her Hatred, but Love ſucceeded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not to that Pity.</p>
            <p>He was too unconcern'd in the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Conſpiracy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main long accus'd of it, and by that time he was almoſt quite clear'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> was ſenſible that ſhe was on the point of marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, he acted after ſuch a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous manner, which deſerv'd ſome kindneſs of her part, &amp; ſhe thought that her duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would be a ſupply to the defects of her Heart.</p>
            <p>One day, that the Count of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boiſe</hi>'s ſorrow was extraordinary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe told him more obliging thing than ſhe had ever done before, bu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

they did but redouble that Lovers affliction: <hi>'Las!

He look'd on her with all the timidity which the thought of having diſpleas'd her did ſuggeſt him, and he ſeem'd by his ſilence to repair his having ſaid too much. At laſt, he ask'd her Pardon for what he had ſaid, or rather for what he had ſeen. Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> was in an extraordinary diſorder. Her trouble and her

            <p>Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> perceiving that Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> came no more to her Houſe, ask'd the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it to her Daughter, and diſtruſting by that young Perſon's confuſion, that there had been ſome Debate betwixt them, ſhe told her that ſhe would have him to be reſpected, ſet before her what he ſhould certainly be to her one day, and even order'd her to

have the Count inform'd by one that was a Friend to both, that she should be very glad to ſee him. Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> was forc'd to obey, but she was the more incens'd againſt him for it.</p>
            <p>Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> was ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that he ought not to penetrate any further than the appearance which was favourable to him; though he fear'd to ſee Madmoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> he went however the next day to her Houſe with earneſtneſs.

            <p>Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> did not expect ſo much from him, but the Sorrow in which ſhe had ſeen him, and the diſpoſition in which he appear'd to be, of diſingaging himſelf, gave her the boldneſs to propoſe it. She repreſented to him with mildneſs, that it was henceforward impoſſible for him to be happy in marrying of her, and that ſeeing he had once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd ſuſpicious thoughts of her, he would never be without ſome, and that ſhe eſteem'd him too much, to make him ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy.

in ſuch a Deſpair as permitted him not to anſwer.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:66339:33"/>
very ſenſibly, and told her she deſerv'd not to be belov'd by the Count, and that she should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly puniſh'd for her indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency to him, in marrying ſome Perſon that should be ſo to her. She wip'd off her Mother's anger with ſome vexation, but her Threatnings did not much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright her; She thought that <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſac</hi> would take advantage of that Liberty in which <hi>D'Amboiſe</hi> had left him, but she did not know what had already paſs'd on that account.</p>
            <p>Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> brought her back again to <hi>Paris,</hi> and the noiſe being ſpread abroad of her break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off with Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> all thoſe that could pretend to her, did endeavour to obtain her.</p>
            <p>The Count of <hi>Sancerre,</hi> who had had ſome inclinations towards her from the firſt inſtant that he had ſeen her, was not then in <hi>France</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:66339:33"/>
The Marqueſs of <hi>Sanſac,</hi> ignorant that Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engag'd himſelf, was ſtill at his Father's Houſe, but it was not long before he heard of it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe who thought on Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> the Viſcount of <hi>Tavanes</hi> was the moſt earneſt, and he made ſome Propoſitions to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her. So ſoon as she was at <hi>Paris,</hi> Madam of <hi>Tournon</hi> did aſſiſt him with all her power. It was a buſineſs of great import to her to have that Marriage fixt, before <hi>Sanſac</hi> ſhould know that the Count of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> pretended no longer to Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye.</hi> She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> all the advantages of that Match. The Viſcount of <hi>Tavanes</hi> had a vaſt Eſtate, and was ſtill ſeeking to increaſe it, ſo that he conſider'd more Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> on the account of thoſe means which were deſign'd her, than on that of her Beauty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:66339:34"/>Madam of <hi>Roye,</hi> who had no concealment from Madam of <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> had intruſted her with all the Count of <hi>Amboiſe</hi>'s Conduct towards her Daughter, and had intreated her to diſcover, whether that young Perſon had not ſome ſecret inclinations. Though her diſtruſts had at firſt lighted on the Marqueſs of <hi>Sanſac,</hi> the refuſal which ſhe had made of him, did put her ſo out of condition of patching it up handſomly again, that it made her wholly decline that Marriage.</p>
            <p>Madam of <hi>Tournon</hi> did ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly believe, that if <hi>Sanſac</hi> lov'd Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> he was alſo belov'd by her, that ſhe went not about to confirm her ſelf in it. Mean time ſhe told Madam of <hi>Roye,</hi> that upon the Examination of her Daughter, ſhe had found in her an indifferency for all men, and more particularly for <hi>Sanſac;</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:66339:34"/>
that it was likely, that too much Love in the Count of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> had made him to decline the marrying a Perſon who was ſo incapable of paſſion, as not to know or diſcern the Sentiments that were had for her. In fine, ſhe advis'd her to accept of the Viſcount of <hi>Tavanes</hi> for her Son-in-law. The buſineſs was treated with much Secrecy, and it had been quickly diſpatch'd, if the King's Sickneſs had not ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended all things.</p>
            <p>He was ſeiz'd, while he was Hunting, with ſuch a violent pain in his Head, that from the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning the conſequences of it were dreaded. That danger he was in recall'd back to <hi>Paris</hi> all thoſe that were concern'd for his life. The Marqueſs of <hi>Sanſac</hi> return'd in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence; The Count of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> though he was ſcarce arriv'd in <hi>England,</hi> return'd into <hi>France.</hi> That Sickneſs prov'd as fatal as it
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:66339:35"/>
had been ſudden. The King died within the ſpace of eight days, and his Death gave a new face to all things. Queen <hi>Mury</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> loſt all that Authority which ſhe had acquired. <hi>Catherine</hi> of <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> was declared Regent during the Minority of <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, and was abſolute. The Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who had been arreſted for that Conſpiracy of which he was thought to be the Chief, was ſet at Liberty; he ſtill had a great Eſteem for <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> and though he could not prevail with him to enter into his Intereſts, he had not lov'd him the leſs.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſs of <hi>Sanſac</hi> did ſpeak with Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> the next day that he came to <hi>Paris;</hi> ſhe was at Madam of <hi>Tournon</hi>'s, where there was great ſtore of Company, and ſhe was ſomewhat at a diſtance from the reſt, ſo that he found a means to place himſelf near her,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:66339:35"/>
without being oppos'd in it by Madam of <hi>Tournon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ask'd Pardon of Madmoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> for thoſe Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which he had caus'd to be made to her Mother, before he had conſulted her; he accus'd thereof the violence of his Paſſion, and he told her, <hi>That what he had heard of her hatred towards him, and Madam of</hi> Roye's <hi>refuſal had ſufficiently puniſh'd him for it.</hi> Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd at that Diſcourſe. <hi>You learn me ſuch new things,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>that I am troubled how to anſwer, and I am as ignorant of the hatred that you ſay I have for you, as of all the reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Madam of <hi>Tournon,</hi> who perceiv'd him very buſie in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> feigning not to ſee it, call'd to her to draw near, telling her, that she was at too much diſtance from
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:66339:36"/>
the reſt of the Company.</p>
            <p>When Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> made reflexions on what he had told her, she believ'd that thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions had been made that very day, and that ſome Reaſons of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt or of Hatred had determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her Mother on a refuſal; ſo she concluded, that she should not marry <hi>Sanſac</hi> at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant that she was certain of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tenderly belov'd by him.</p>
            <p>Mean time this Marqueſs was gathering freſh hopes, he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that he was not hated. He further comprehended, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Madam of <hi>Roye,</hi> in refuſing him ſo cruelly, had ſought no further than to keep her Word with Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> and that things being now chang'd as to that Concern, a ſecond Attempt might ſucceed. He would have engag'd his Father the very next morning, to mention it to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:66339:36"/>
of <hi>Roye,</hi> but he found him ſo pierc'd with ſorrow for the Death of the King, whoſe Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour he had been, that he would not ſo much as hear him.</p>
            <p>This Marqueſs was too amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous not to fear being prevented by his Rivals. He knew Madam of <hi>Tournon</hi>'s power over Madam of <hi>Roye;</hi> he declar'd to her his Love, and did conjure her to ſpeak in his behalf, till his Father could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on that buſineſs. Madam of <hi>Tournon</hi> was offended at this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, but ſhe took upon her to diſſemble, and ſhe did not much fear but that it would ſucceed. She aſſur'd him, that it ſhould not be her fault if he was not happy. He believ'd her, and in that belief he went to ſee Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> that very day, but many things had paſs'd that he knew not of.</p>
            <p>So ſoon as Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> was return'd from <hi>England,</hi> he had
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:66339:37"/>
waited on that Counteſs, who had receiv'd him with great affection; She had but newly inform'd her Daughter that ſhe deſign'd her for the Viſcount of <hi>Tavanes,</hi> and that News had given her ſo great a trouble, that ſhe had had no more time but to anſwer, that ſhe ſhould always obey her, and had gone out of her Mother's Chamber to give a full vent to her Tears.</p>
            <p>When ſhe perceiv'd that ſhe had avoided to marry the Count of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boiſe,</hi> but to be deliver'd up to the Viſcount of <hi>Tavanes,</hi> ſhe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolable. His Perſon had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways diſpleas'd her, and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign rendred him odious; She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd that that perfect Eſteem which ſhe had for the Count of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> might ſupply, the place of Love, and that it had been ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier for her to become his, ſince ſhe had no longer hopes of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying <hi>Sanſac,</hi> than to be the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:66339:37"/>
of <hi>Tavanes</hi>'s. In fine, the paſs'd danger did no longer appear an evil to her, and ſhe gave that name but to the preſent.</p>
            <p>Madam of <hi>Roye,</hi> deſirous to let <hi>Amboiſe</hi> know he had not loſt her confiance in him, made no Secret to him of Monſieur of <hi>Tavanes</hi>'s Marriage with her Daughter, and ſhe ſpoke to him of it, as a thing that would be very ſoon concluded. What did not that News produce in Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi>'s mind? Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> was going to marry a man whom he knew that ſhe did not love. The thoughts of loſing her for ever, and to ſee her in the poſſeſſion of an Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who had ſo little deſerv'd her, did excite at once his deſpair and his indignation.</p>
            <p>He begg'd the permiſſion of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam of <hi>Roye</hi> of ſeeing her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and he immediately went to find her in her Apartment. She
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:66339:38"/>
was in ſuch a ſorrowful condition, that he ſtood not in need of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Love to be ſenſibly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with it. Her Face was cover'd with Tears, which did not diminiſh her Beauty. <hi>You are Witneſs of my Sorrow,</hi> ſaid ſhe, (finding that ſhe could not hide her Tears) <hi>and you will ſoon learn what has caus'd it. I know, it may be, but too much already,</hi> reply'd he, <hi>and I dare ſay, Madmoiſelle, that I am more ſenſible of thoſe evils that you feel, than of all thoſe that you have made me. How cruel is your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to me,</hi> ſaid Madmoiſelle of Roye, <hi>whoſe Sorrow forc'd to ſpeak! Conceal it from me in compaſſion, that I may leſs know the value of what I have loſt. What do you tell me, Madmoiſelle?</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I have not acquired ſo much indifferency, as to hear quietly thoſe words from your mouth. I ſeek not to flatter you,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>but it is certain that</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:66339:38"/>
               <hi>I ſhall repent my ſelf all my life time of the proceeding that I have had with you, and that I ſhall find my ſelf moſt unfortunate in marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Viſcount of</hi> Tavanes. <hi>Ah! Madmoiſelle,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of my diſgrace, ſince it draws from you ſuch obliging words in my behalf; is it poſſible for you to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to any one? I had never known it, had you not forc'd me to renounce my pretences to you; but what obſtacles ſoever I have put to my happineſs, it were not impoſſible for me to overcome them, if you conſented to it. You would have my conſent much more eaſily, if that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified any thing,</hi> ſaid Madmoiſelle of Roye, <hi>who ſaw nothing yet but the torment of marrying</hi> Tavanes. Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> was ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with the Joy which thoſe words gave him, that he had no proſpect of what could trouble her. The Suſpicions which he
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:66339:39"/>
had had of <hi>Sanſac,</hi> were blotted out of his mind. He found that he had taken them on light Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> had ſpoken to him of <hi>Tavanes</hi>'s Marriage as a thing very far advanc'd, but not wholly concluded. He went to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> he conjur'd him to ſpeak to Madam of <hi>Roye,</hi> for he had been in too great a confuſion in ſpeaking to her himſelf, becauſe of the irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which he had ſhewn in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. That Prince who had ſo far condeſcended as to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Particulars of his Amours, ſo ſoon as it had began, ſeiz'd on that opportunity of doing him a good office. He went to ſee Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam of <hi>Roye,</hi> and he eaſily enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her to re-enter into her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Friendſhip with the Count of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> whom ſhe had always valued more than all the reſt: She told her Daughter, that if it was
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:66339:39"/>
true that ſhe had no inclinations towards the Viſcount of <hi>Tavaues,</hi> ſhe would proceed no further with him, but take up again her firſt Engagements with Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> who had at firſt only thought of not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying <hi>Tavanes,</hi> perceiv'd that ſhe had but chang'd her misfortune; this of truth, was the leaſt of the two, but it was ſufficient to bring her to deſpair. In fine, 'twas her own doing, there was no ways left for her to avoid it, wherefore ſhe told her Mother, that ſhe would obey her without any repugnancy.</p>
            <p>Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> did raiſe ſome difficulties about the Marriage of the Count of <hi>Tavanes,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not yet engag'd her Word to him, ſhe broke off the Match, as if ſhe had not deſign'd any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>Madam of <hi>Tournon,</hi> who was
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:66339:40"/>
too deeply engag'd in her Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to be ignorant of what paſs'd, did offer <hi>Sanſac</hi>'s Propoſitions to her; after ſhe had found that there was no hopes left for him, which made him be refus'd a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time. That Counteſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd him of it, with all the malice that ſhe was capable of. She made him a confidence of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanes</hi>'s Deſigns, and of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, telling him beſides, that Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> could not bear the thoughts of being any body's elſe but <hi>Amboiſe</hi>'s; that a ſmall thing having made them to differ, their Accommodation had been eaſie; and that ſhe had her ſelf engag'd her Lover to get ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſpeak to her Mother about it. The thing was true in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, ſhe told it in the ſame manner to ſome Perſons, that it might be reported again to <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſac.</hi> He entred into a violent Fury
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:66339:40"/>
againſt Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye;</hi> he accus'd her of having deceiv'd him by her falſe Kindneſs. He accus'd himſelf of having deſign'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive himſelf. He examin'd how feeble thoſe things were which had flatter'd him. In fine, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd himſelf to deſpair, as eaſily as he had given himſelf up to hope, and at laſt ceas'd from ſeeing Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She had taken up a reſolution, which ſhe had much to do to keep, her Sorrow was exceſſive, and <hi>Amboiſe</hi> was not ſo happy as not to diſcern it. All thoſe Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions which he had entertain'd of <hi>Sanſac,</hi> return'd into his mind, yet the preference which ſhe had given him to the Viſcount of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanes,</hi> and the flattering things which ſhe had told him on that Subject, did buoy him up againſt his Suſpicions; and though thoſe reflexions might diſturb that good
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:66339:41"/>
Fortune which he waited for, it did not hinder him from expecting of it.</p>
            <p>All things did diſpoſe themſelves in order to his Marriage. Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> had a great regard for him; but when ſhe was alone, ſhe would compenſate <hi>Sanſac</hi> with a Deluge of Tears. She look'd upon her ſelf as the Cauſe of his Sorrows. She had never ſeen her ſelf ſo ready to enter into an Engagement, againſt which her whole Heart did revolt. She was not able to ſupport thoſe various agitations, and ſhe fell ſick.</p>
            <p>What a trouble was this to Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe!</hi> he could not doubt but that her ſickneſs was the effect of that vexation which ſhe had of marrying him. He thought himſelf oblig'd to viſit her every day, and he found her full of Reſpect for him. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Grief which ſhe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:66339:41"/>
him, he eſteem'd her the more, and he lov'd her not leſs, on the contrary, Admiration and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion joyning with his other Sentiments, did render his Paſſion the ſtronger, but at the ſame time more capable of Reaſon. How could he find in his heart to force a Perſon, who conſtrained her ſelf for his ſake? He found that he muſt diſingage himſelf a ſecond time, but then in reſtoring Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> to her ſelf, he should put her into the hands of his Rival. That thought would make him tremble, and he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on nothing.</p>
            <p>Mean time Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roy</hi>'s ſickneſs increas'd daily. He then was ſenſible, that he lov'd her to that degree, as not to diſpute her any longer to his Rival at ſo dear a rate as her own life. He found that she could not be but unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py with any other. He thought
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:66339:42"/>
he might obtain ſo much over himſelf. He even flatter'd himſelf with the thoughts, that perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture an extraordinary Action would produce an extraordinary Effect, and that if it did not bring back Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> to him, by doing that for her which ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were not capable to do, he should at leaſt render all other men unworthy of being belov'd by her. Finally, out of the Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of all his Hopes, he did frame to himſelf a new kind of Hope. At leaſt he thought that he should ſower his Rival's hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, in reſigning his Miſtreſs to him. But after all, theſe were but Ideas. His heart could not reliſh thoſe Reaſons, and it was eaſier for him to perform the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, than to reſolve it.</p>
            <p>The next day he went to ſee Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye.</hi> He found her weeping, though she endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:66339:42"/>
to conceal her Tears, and to ſhew a ſerene and clear Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. It is difficult to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the condition he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in. The ſtrugglings, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, which was made in his behalf, did lead him unto that which he was to do on himſelf. Love, Compaſſion, Deſpair did produce a thouſand Combats in his Soul. He remain'd a long while without ſpeaking; but at laſt, beholding Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> with Eyes bathed in Tears; <hi>Madmoiſelle,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>you have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto had more ſtrength than I, I tremble at my Project, but yet I may execute it. You ſet before me an Example of dying, if it muſt be ſo, through conſtraint. Well, the buſineſs is done, I will tear me from my ſelf, conceal not from me your Sentiments for</hi> Sanſac. <hi>I will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake any thing to make him enjoy an Happineſs, of which you judge</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:66339:43"/>
               <hi>him more deſerving than me; for can I be more unhappy than I am already? At leaſt I ſhall pleaſe you in giving you to my Rival.</hi> He obſerv'd, during this Diſcourſe, an impreſſion of Joy on the Face of Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> which he had never before ſeen. He was in a Deſpair at what he was going to do, and yet did not repent it. There are certain moments in which one ſeems to act by a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Power; what he was doing did more partake of the Hero than of the Lover, and at the ſame time did render him worthy both of Envy and Compaſſion. <hi>I am going, Madmoiſelle,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>about a Deſign which will not be finiſh'd, if retarded, and all the Favour that I require of you, is, not to forget, where-ever you ſee me, that I am the moſt miſerable of all men for Love of You.</hi> Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> was not able to reſiſt the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:66339:43"/>
diverſity of emotion that ſhe was in. Surpriſe, Fear, and Shame did agitate her Heart, inſomuch that her Feaver redoubled in an inſtant, ſo conſiderably, that it was thought her Life was going to be in very great danger. There needed not ſo much to fix Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> in his reſolution. He run to Madam of <hi>Roye</hi>'s Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he inform'd her of the danger in which her Daughter was, and of the Paſſion which had ſeiz'd her Heart. He conjur'd her to have no further regard for him, and to think of nothing but of Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye.</hi> That Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did really love her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. That young Perſon's ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs did put her in a wonderful agitation, and any thing that could contribute to her Cure, did ſeem pleaſing to her. She expreſs'd to Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> how ſenſible ſhe was of his Generoſity, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:66339:44"/>
gave him Praiſes, of which he was very inſenſible. He found that he ſucceeded too eaſily in that which he had undertaken. He left Madam of <hi>Roye,</hi> and went home, where he ſhut himſelf up, and abandoned himſelf unto all that Deſpair can repreſent us of horrid. When he found that he had no more to do, he thought on what he had done. He lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurely look'd on the Marriage of Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Sanſac,</hi> againſt which there were no more obſtacles to remove. He found that he himſelf had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd her unto him, whom of all other men he ſhould moſt fear ſhould poſſeſs her, and he was a thouſand times on the point of puniſhing him for what he had already done for him, to prevent him by his death, from obtaining a good which he had newly aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd to him. After that, he
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:66339:44"/>
repreſented to himſelf that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which he had ſeen Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of <hi>Roye.</hi> That Idea would retain him, but then he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider to what an exceſs of miſery his Compaſſion had brought him. He appear'd as newly come out of a Dream, and he had much ado to believe the Reality of that which he had the power to perform. He fanſied that Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> would forget what he had done for her, and how much it had coſt him, through the Joy that ſhe ſhould receive of being poſſeſs'd by a man whom ſhe tenderly lov'd. That reflexion rendred all things unſufferable to him; he fancy'd that he could hate Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> as much as he did <hi>Sanſac,</hi> and he believ'd that he would never ſee the one nor the other.</p>
            <p>Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> did employ one of her Friends, who was Friend
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:66339:45"/>
alſo to the Marqueſs of <hi>Sanſac,</hi> to let him know that Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> was wholly diſingag'd from Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> and that if he made any ſteps towards obtaining of her, he ſhould no longer meet with any obſtacles. That Marqueſs was too deeply in Love, to make any reflexions on thoſe Refuſals which he had twice already receiv'd. Thoſe Advances which Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> now made him, were ſufficient reparations, but he was deſirous to know her Daughter's Sentiments. He went to that Counteſs's; where he did ſee Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> unto whom Joy reſtor'd that Health, which Sorrow and Grief had taken from her. It was not hard for him to perceive that he was belov'd; he partly apprehended it by thoſe things which ſhe let ſcape, and more yet by thoſe which ſhe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided to tell him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:66339:45"/>The Marqueſs of <hi>Sanſac</hi> infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his Father of the favourable Change to his advantage, which had been made in Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi>'s mind, but he found that he was no longer in the ſame diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions for her Alliance. That re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal which ſhe had made of her Son, had ſo irritated him, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be reconcil'd; but other Reaſons beſides did joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to that. The Count of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſac</hi> was hated by <hi>Catherine de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis,</hi> becauſe he had been Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to <hi>Francis</hi> the Second, who ſhe had never lov'd. She com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd that that Governour had brought him up in a great inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency in regard of her, and ſhe had ſome diſguſt even againſt his Son alſo, on that account. She had had occaſion to obſerve when he dyed, how much her Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had been reſpected by all the Court, except the <hi>Sanſacs.</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:66339:46"/>
The Body of the late King was carried to St. <hi>Denis</hi> without any Shew. Meſſieurs of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to the Queen his Wife, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not on the Corps, and that the Count of <hi>Sanſac</hi> alone, with his Son, did accompany him. The Queen Regent was not long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out shewing her reſentments to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Count of <hi>Sanſac</hi> on di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers occaſions. He was no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſeconded by any Perſon, he found that he had occaſion of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſupported.</p>
            <p>Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> and even Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> alſo, who trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled not her ſelf, but with what concern'd her Daughter, having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways follow'd the Court of <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> more than that of <hi>Catherine de Medicis,</hi> were not proper Perſons to reſtore him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into Favour. He had other Vows, and he told his Son, that after the diſobliging refuſal which
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:66339:46"/>
Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> had made of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him for her Son-in-law, he ought to be aſham'd of deſiring ſtill to become ſo, and declar'd, that he would never give his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to that Marriage. That Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did caſt himſelf at his Father's feet; he told him, that the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of his whole life depended on marrying of Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> but he could not make him alter his Deſign.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſs of <hi>Sanſac</hi> rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt his Father at that Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, his Mother had left him great means, and though thoſe of his Father were conſiderable, he ſacrific'd them all without relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy to his Love. He drew two of his Uncles to his Party, who made all the ſteps which were to be made towards Madam of <hi>Roye,</hi> and whoſe Propoſitions were receiv'd, but on condition that the Marqueſs of <hi>Sanſac</hi> ſhould
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:66339:47"/>
reconcile himſelf to his Father a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, before the Marriage ſhould be finiſh'd, and that their Treaty ſhould remain ſecret till then.</p>
            <p>Mean time that Marqueſs had the liberty to viſit frequently Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> whoſe health did daily ſtrengthen, and whoſe Beauty did ſtill increaſe, ſince her heart had been at eaſe. She ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly did feel what ſhe owed to the Count of <hi>Amboiſe.</hi> She would gladly have ſhewn him, how much ſhe was concern'd at it, and have given him ſome ſatisfaction in her acknowledgment for thoſe Sentiments which ſhe could not have for him; but ſhe could not ſee him to do it, becauſe he took care to avoid her. Mean time he learnt that her Marriage with <hi>Sanſac</hi> was not ſuddenly to be accompliſh'd; but though thoſe thoughts might in ſome meaſure alleviate his grief, hey took it not away.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:66339:47"/>Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac</hi> return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> ſhe learnt with no ſmall pleaſure <hi>Amboiſe</hi>'s Action, and ſhe continually did ſpeak of it to Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye.</hi> One day that they were walking together in the Gardens of the <hi>Louvre,</hi> they met with him all alone, raving ſo profoundly, that he was near Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it. He would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd his Walk, but that ſhe ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped him. <hi>You will let me,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>make advantage of theſe opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which meer Chance affords me, of letting you know my Sentiments, I have long ſought after them in vain. Why, Madmoiſelle,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>it would be cruel to deſire to ſee me ſtill, I am of no uſe to you.</hi> And making her a profound Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, he retired, without look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once on Madmoiſelle of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſac.</hi> They were ſurpris'd at this flight. Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac</hi> was
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:66339:48"/>
vex'd that he had not ſo much as taken notice of her. Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> knew by the Count's Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and by his ſudden Retreat, how ſtrong his Paſſion ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd, and how extraordinary his Generoſity had been. She had a moſt ſenſible Grief, for having rendred ſo worthy a man ſo miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
            <p>He was very much troubled for having left her ſo abruptly, he fear'd having offended her, and that ſhe ſhould come in time to hate him. In ſhort, he had ſtill felt ſome ſatisfaction in ſeeing her. He had depriv'd himſelf of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent for fear of abandoning himſelf too much to it; but he found that his Reaſoning had been too cruel, and what could happen to him of greater Sorrow, than to be hated by Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> and of never ſeeing her? Yet he would not go to her Houſe, but he found
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:66339:48"/>
that it would be a great ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to him to meet her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sanſac</hi> did find the retarding of his happineſs ſo unſufferable, that he was not much leſs afflicted, than when he was uncertain of being belov'd. It was in vain that he preſs'd Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that he ſhould marry her Daughter, but notwithſtanding the Marqueſs of <hi>Sanſac</hi>'s vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſhe would not conſent that he ſhould loſe part of his Eſtate by making too much haſte. That Eſteem which that Counteſs had for <hi>D'Amboiſe,</hi> did make her wiſh that he might ſtill remain in the number of her Friends. Mean time, though ſhe was vexed that ſhe no longer had any Commerce with him, ſhe durſt not reproach him of it, but having occaſion to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy him in a conſiderable buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, she let him know it, and he could not diſpence from going
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:66339:49"/>
to her. He return'd thither with ſome trouble and with ſome ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. He found Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> all alone in her Mother's Chamber, and he was ſo ſurpris'd and ſeiz'd at the ſight of her, that he remain'd without motion.</p>
            <p>Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> was in her Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet with a Perſon of Worth, when he came in. They being buſie in a particular Concern, she met him, and intreated him to remain one moment with her Daughter in her Chamber. Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> was at firſt ſight diſturb'd at the preſence of a man unto whom she was ſo infinitely oblig'd, and whom she judg'd, by what had lately happen'd, that even her acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment might trouble. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Count of <hi>Amboiſe's</hi> trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was extraordinary, he found himſelf again near a Perſon who he had been forc'd to abandon, but who he ſtill ador'd, and yet would
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:66339:49"/>
no more declare it, though he wiſht she did know it; in fine, with a Perſon who rais'd in him a moſt cruel Jealouſie, and who inſpired him with extreme Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. They both kept ſilence for a time, and she firſt broke it. <hi>I cannot hinder my ſelf from rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing at the ſight of you,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>though you appear not to be pleas'd with being here. Madmoiſelle,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd he, <hi>is it poſſible that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a Miſerable, whom you have forc'd to renounce you, ſhould not be diſpleaſing to you? I have not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd you to it,</hi> ſaid Madmoiſelle of Roye, <hi>you have made me a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Sacrifice. 'Las! Madmoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle, you were dying, if I had not made it. You could not bear the thought of being mine; I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving you of that Perſon without which you cannot live. You ſay a great deal,</hi> reply'd Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> bluſhing. <hi>'Las! Madam, why</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:66339:50"/>
               <hi>all this conſtraint and reſervedneſs? Confeſs that you love my Rival. I know it, and I can perceive it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my will, and that reſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of which you make uſe, is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement of tenderneſs, of which I am more jealous, than of all other things which you could ſignifie to me, that you had for him. But what am I telling you,</hi> continu'd he, <hi>why do I let you ſee theſe things? I beg your pardon, I love you, I ſhall love you all my life. I could not ſo maſter my ſelf, as not to ſpeak to you once of</hi> Sanſac, <hi>but I ſhall mention him no more. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect you enough, to reſpect even your Paſſion. I ſhall inceſſantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain my ſelf, and I ſhall never entertain you of mine. And the only Favour that I demand of you, is, that you would conſider me, as ſomething more than a Friend. I even look upon you,</hi> reply'd ſhe, <hi>as ſomething more than a Lover. You</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:66339:50"/>
               <hi>have done for me things ſo little common, that I cannot have for you any common Sentiments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Count's Conduct had been ſo worthy of Admiration, and Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> was ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to him, that ſhe thought ſhe ought to ſpeak to him with mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet after ſuch a manner, as ſhould not flatter his Love; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe words did cauſe him to ſigh. Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> came in as ſhe was ending. That Counteſs inform'd Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> in what he could ſerve her, and he promis'd to obey her punctually in what ſhe deſired. They were of ſome Concern to Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> and he found himſelf plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the pleaſure of ſerving her. Her Civilities, or rather her Sight, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh'd a kind of Softneſs in his Soul, though ſhe had not ſaid any thing to him which favour'd his Paſſion. It was
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:66339:51"/>
ſtill much, that ſhe had for him all the Eſteem which he deſerv'd, and that ſhe had given him notice of it.</p>
            <p>The buſineſs in which Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> had employ'd him, did oblige him to return more than once to her Houſe. He no longer did avoid Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roy's</hi> Company, and he began again to accuſtom himſelf to ſpeak to her. It may be alſo that he found in his heart ſome tendency towards hope. The obſtacles which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the Marriage of the Marqueſs of <hi>Sanſac,</hi> might laſt long. It was not impoſſible but that a ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and diſintereſſed Conduct might acquire a particular good Will from Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> towards him, and that he never mentioning his Paſſion to her, yet ſtill letting her perceive that it was not extinct, ſhould not gain at laſt ſome advantage on thoſe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:66339:51"/>
Sentiments which ſhe had for a Rival, who deſerv'd them leſs than he.</p>
            <p>Madam of <hi>Tournon</hi> was ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vext that ſhe could not prevent the conjunction of <hi>Sanſac</hi> with Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye;</hi> ſhe ſought after ſome means, at leaſt, to break it, and the Count of <hi>Sancerre,</hi> who about that time return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> appear'd fit to ſerve her in that Deſign, he was her particular Friend, but he had never inform'd her of his inclinations towards Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> and ſhe had diſcover'd it but through that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication which ſhe had always had for any thing that concern'd that lovely Perſon; he had ever had much to do to own a paſſion to her from which he hoped ſo little, that he had conceal'd it even from the Perſon who had caus'd it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:66339:52"/>The Count of <hi>Sancerre</hi> was well made, he was ſubtle, dextrous, and witty. The Counteſs had prevented him as much as ſhe could from loving Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> and ſhe had contributed much in making him undertake that Journey which he had made partly to avoid her. But Love caus'd her to change her Deſigns, ſhe ſacrific'd the Jealouſie of Love unto that tenderneſs which ſhe had for <hi>Sanſac,</hi> and ſhe did aſſure the Count of <hi>Sancerre,</hi> that ſhe ſhould compaſs her Ends in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him to marry her, provided he would exactly follow that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct which ſhe ſhould preſcribe to him. She advis'd him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to inſinuate himſelf in her mind, under the notion of a Friend, and to conceal from her his real Sentiments, till the fit time to let them break forth with ſucceſs. <hi>Sancerre</hi> did approve of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:66339:52"/>
an Advice which did ſo well agree with his Humour and his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.</p>
            <p>Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac</hi> could not bear with that indifferency which <hi>d'Amboiſe</hi> had for her, she began to treat him ill, and to be almoſt rude to him, which from a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Perſon could not be but ſo many marks of a paſſion. He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, with trouble, thoſe Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents unto which he could not anſwer, and of which his own misfortunes did invite him to have ſome compaſſion. Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> perceived in what a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the heart of her Friend was, by thoſe odd kind of Complaints which she inceſſantly made her of that Count. She fear'd every thing, from a diſpoſition like that of Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe;</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times she did hope that Madmoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle of <hi>Sanſac's</hi> tenderneſs would move him; she would have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:66339:53"/>
it to him, but when she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on the independency of inclinations, that which she felt in her Heart of that Nature, caus'd her to tremble, in the behalf of her Friend.</p>
            <p>Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac</hi> remain'd in a Melancholy, which prevented the return of her health. She had ask'd leave of the Queen to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw her ſelf from Court, and she liv'd with her Father very retired<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> did ſhare in her troubles, and she was ſo juſt as to remain oblig'd to her for it. That indifferency which Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> had for <hi>D'Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boiſe,</hi> did flatter Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac,</hi> and hindred her from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of her. She endeavour'd to ſoften her Father's mind on <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſac's</hi> Marriage with Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> and deſpair'd not of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing it; but there happen'd new Cauſes of Sorrow, which
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:66339:53"/>
prevented her from executing that which she had propos'd.</p>
            <p>One day that they were toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac's</hi> Coach, they perceiv'd <hi>Amboiſe</hi> in his, carried away by his Horſes with ſo much violence, that his life was in danger. Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac</hi> grew pale, and bid her men to drive her Coach croſs their paſſage to ſtop them. She ſpoke in ſuch an earneſt and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing manner to them, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the danger which they run in themſelves in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they follow'd her Orders, which was done with ſo much good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, the Horſes, whoſe firſt fury began to relent, meeting with the others in Front, paſs'd no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>As he was going to return thanks to thoſe who had put themſelves in danger to ſave him, he perceiv'd <hi>Sanſac's</hi> Liveries, he
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:66339:54"/>
thought it was his Rival, and was ſtrangely troubled to owe him his life. Mean time, not to let him ſee any ingratitude, which he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally had not, he advanc'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that Coach, but perceiv'd in it nothing but Women. Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> did preſent her ſelf firſt to his ſight, Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac</hi> had found her ſelf ſo ill through the diſturbance which that Adventure had caus'd in her, that she had been oblig'd to lean on one of her hands. He was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to return thanks to Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> in terms in which his Paſſion did expreſs it ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Will; but she told him, that he owed the whole obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac;</hi> and though he was vex'd to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd himſelf in a thing that had ſo much pleas'd him, he could not diſpence himſelf from returning her thanks with great acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:66339:54"/>
he left them to let them continue their way.</p>
            <p>After he had left them, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of <hi>Sanſac</hi> finding her ſelf with Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye; You have ſeen my weakneſs,</hi> ſaid she, <hi>it is no longer time for me to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it. I have always deny'd my ſelf the ſatisfaction of complaining to you, that I might not entertain a Sorrow which I condemn. Take pity on me, and afford me ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.

Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac</hi> perceiv'd with Sorrow, that they were come to that place where they were expected. That Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did pleaſe her, and she in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> to

               <hi>ſhould give you occaſion of not being well pleas'd with me, and that gave me cauſe alſo of not being well pleas'd with you.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:66339:56"/>
Count; She deſign'd to render him ſenſible of the pleaſure of being belov'd by a beautiful Perſon; She made him a ſenſible repreſentation of Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac's</hi> Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. In fine, ſhe knew that ſhe hazarded nothing in making him ſuch a confidence. The Count's diſcretion was known, and it was certain, that if he gloried not in his Conqueſt, however he would not make any boaſt of it. He could not anſwer to that which ſhe had ſaid, becauſe that Madam of <hi>Roye,</hi> who had left off play, did riſe to be gone, and took her Daughter along with her, even before that ſhe had finiſh'd what ſhe had to ſay, but he thought of nothing but to prevent her from believing that he had made any reflexion on it.</p>
            <p>Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> would not inform Monſieur of <hi>Sanſac,</hi> that the Count of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> was not yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:66339:56"/>
wholly indifferent, for fear of exciting him againſt a Perſon to whom he was oblig'd for yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his Right to him. She owed that weak conſideration un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Count, in conſideration of thoſe extraordinary things which he had done for her. Thoſe Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents did not hurt her Paſſion. She was far from taking any other for Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> than thoſe of Compaſſion; and if ſhe was divided betwixt thoſe two Lovers, it was that ſhe pitied the one, and lov'd the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>D'Amboiſe</hi> had found out a Pretence to go the next morning to Madam of <hi>Roye,</hi> but he met her at the Gate of the <hi>Louver.</hi> He told her that he had had that Deſign, and that having divers things to ſay, he would do it when ſhe were return'd.

Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> was not with her Mother. Who told him, that ſhe was gone to walk, and nam'd to him the place. But ſhe told him not that it was with Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac,</hi> becauſe ſhe was follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Madam of <hi>Roye,</hi> and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time to do it.</p>
            <p>Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> run to the place, without examining any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It was in one of thoſe fine places, which credit their Maſters by being ſeen. Perſons came to it two different ways; he came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Garden, where he found at firſt none but Madmoiſelle of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſac.</hi> Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> had been detain'd by Madam of <hi>Tournon,</hi> who having met her, would have accompanied her, ſo that ſhe had feign'd to go elſewhere, that ſhe might be alone with her Friend.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>D'Amboiſe,</hi> who had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac,</hi> could not avoid ſpeaking to her.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:66339:57"/>
She told him, that ſhe was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> and that ſhe was weary of ſtaying for her; ſo that he could not leave her. till her Company was come. They were both in a diſorder, the Count did fancy that Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> ſeeing him with Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac,</hi> would fancy that he might have made ſome reflexions on what had been ſaid the night before, and he had left her abruptly, had he not been detain'd with a deſire of ſeeing Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye.</hi> Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of <hi>Sanſac</hi> was not in a leſs perplexity.

            <p>AT laſt Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> did joyn them; they were not far from the Garden-door, and they went to meet her ſo far. She joy'd the Count for being in ſo good Company, with a deſign of obliging him to ſay
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:66339:58"/>
ſome kind thing or other to Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of <hi>Sanſac,</hi> but he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took upon him to juſtifie his intentions after a manner which caus'd Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> to fear leſt he ſhould diſoblige her Friend; She made a pretence of immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately returning, took Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac</hi> with her. <hi>I will,</hi> ſaid ſhe to Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe, take her from you, to puniſh you of your diſſimulation.</hi> Ending theſe words, ſhe got into her Coach with ſo much haſte, that he had not time to anſwer.</p>
            <p>He was very much troubled to ſee Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye's</hi> obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in perſwading her ſelf in an opinion, which he knew how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever would not trouble her; whether he fear'd giving her the leaſt ſubject of Jealouſie, or of giving her none, he could not be pleas'd at it, the trouble, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, or the indifferency of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:66339:59"/>
that fair Creature, were equally cruel to him.</p>
            <p>He was in the mind of running after her, and of not leaving her till he had wholly juſtified him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but the pretence which ſhe had taken of returning, giving him ſome reaſon to believe that ſhe would not be ſo ſoon at her Houſe, he went to wait on the King, and he left againſt his Will thoſe two Lovers at liberty.</p>
            <p>When they were return'd to Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye's,</hi> and got into her Chamber, ſhe found her ſelf in ſome diſorder. That little ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs which ſhe foreſaw as to Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of <hi>Sanſac's</hi> Paſſion, did make her fear entring on that Subject; yet ſhe perceiv'd that her ſilence was a greater trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; ſo that ſhe invited her to ſpeak, that it might eaſe her mind, though it afforded her no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>

               <hi>If one durſt ask you,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>by what means the Count of</hi> Amboiſe <hi>could produce in you for his Perſon, ſuch Sentiments as he is ſo unworthy of—I know that I am in the wrong,</hi> reply'd Madmoiſelle of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſac,</hi> interrupting her; <hi>yet I can in a manner excuſe my ſelf, I unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably did ſee Monſieur of</hi> Amboiſe <hi>with you: I thought him amiable on the very account of that zeal with which he lov'd; I was charm'd with his tenderneſs. You lov'd him not; and though this knowledge gave me a private ſatisfaction, I did blame your injuſtice, and I went too far in going about to avoid it. When I ſpoke to the Queen, to prevent your Marriage with him, I thought to ingage my ſelf in it for your ſake, or for my Brother's; but I have ſince found that it was my own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt that puſh'd me on; Madam of</hi> Roye <hi>did render all my Projects uſeleſs, in her ſtedfaſtneſs to her</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:66339:60"/>
               <hi>firſt Sentiments for the Count; I was troubled for not having ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed better. You return'd into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the Count went frequently to viſit you; I did ſcarce ſee him after that, which gave me to underſtand how dear he was to me; I would have oppos'd my ſelf to my inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but it was in vain, and at the very time that I endeavour'd to call back my Reaſon; I continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally did think on him, and ſo made an end of loſing it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She remain'd ſilent during a while; then ſhe continu'd, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> did not ſpeak; <hi>I did feel diſtinctly a Jealouſie; I had ſome regret for having offer'd to take you from the Count, ſeeing that thereby he was not the more mine: but I fell in a Deſpair when he thought a ſecond time of marrying you, and I found no quiet, till by an extraordinary exceſs of Love, he had reſign'd you</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:66339:60"/>
               <hi>to his Rival. That Action did highly increaſe my Eſteem, in my opinion it did authoriſe that which I felt for him, and even that which I had acted againſt him; and tho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Example of Generoſity did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn me, I could not ſee the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of his proceeding and mine; I thought that my Conduct was juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſufficiently by that unconcerned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and your indifferency; but in effect, it was but a little hope which did juſtifie all. Alas! I was not long in that ſituation, If I had ſome moments that were leſs diſagreeable, they were but moments ſtill, you can tell whether I have had any occaſion to flatter my ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac</hi> could no longer continue ſuch a Diſcourſe, and pouring forth a Torrent of Tears, ſhe oblig'd Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> to ſpeak to her. <hi>I am more miſerable than you,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I feel all your troubles as you do your ſelf,</hi>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:66339:61"/>
               <hi>and I have beſides the trouble of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving caus'd them; It is through my means that you have particularly known the Count of</hi> Amboiſe; <hi>It is perhaps through his Love to me, that he enters not into thoſe Sentiments which are due to your Merits. In fine, it is my indifferency towards him, that has given place to your pity; all turns to poiſon to you, I dare not undertake any thing, and after I have caus'd all your Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, I have the trouble of not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to bring you out of them; You ought not to have any more friendſhip for me; You conſider me as a Rival; perhaps that you hate me. No,</hi> reply'd Madmoiſelle of Sanſac, <hi>it is</hi>-Amboiſe <hi>that muſt be hated, and not you, but I cannot have ſo much as the ſatisfaction of hating either of you. What has he done to me? he has not betray'd me, ſeeing that he never lov'd me. Alas! muſt that be the Cauſe that</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:66339:61"/>
               <hi>muſt take me off of complaining?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here her redoubled Tears did force her a ſecond time to ſilence, and Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome alteration in her Face, fear'd that she ſhould not be well, and oblig'd her to lay her ſelf on the Bed; after which she went into her Cloſet to ſpeak with one of her Servants, it was to tell her from Madam of <hi>Roye,</hi> that the Count of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> was to come, and that she ſhould receive him, if he came before her return. He came in that very inſtant; and having ſeen no body in the Anti-Chamber nor in the Chamber, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> had order'd her Women, when she came in with Madmoiſelle of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſac,</hi> to go into her Cloſet, which was at ſome diſtance, that they might not interrupt their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation: he was going out, but Madmoiſele of <hi>Sanſac</hi> having tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:66339:62"/>
her ſelf to ſee who it was, she had made a little noiſe, he drew near to the Bed, whoſe Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains were half drawn. He knew her not, she had part of her Coifs over her Face; he took her to be Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> who was reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Bed; ſo that having ſtill his mind fill'd with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture of the Garden, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo to loſe the opportunity of ſpeaking to her. <hi>Madmoiſelle,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I cannot defer one moment juſtifying of my ſelf, could you be ſo hard-hearted to belive that I could love Madmoiſelle of</hi> Sanſac? <hi>I had not yeſterday leiſure to anſwer you, on what you would have had me to think of her Sentiments; but was there any occaſion for that? If that your indifferency could not make me change, all the paſſion that can be had for me, could do no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended that ſome body was
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:66339:62"/>
entring, and who alſo was adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd another way, that it was Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> return'd in the Chamber, and ſaid to him with a loud voice, That a Lady of her Friends was ſleeping on that Bed, and that she would receive him in another Chamber, but she knew not that he had ſaid too much already.</p>
            <p>Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac</hi> had been ſtruck by it as with a Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt, and that laſt misfortune was ſo horrid, that nothing but death could take from her the ſhame and the ſorrow of it. She remain'd on the Bed of Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> overwhelm'd with divers different thoughts, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any reſolution.</p>
            <p>Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> was with Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye;</hi> he was tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her the ſame things, which he thought that he had told her before, when he had ſpoken to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:66339:63"/>
Mdamoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac;</hi> but she let him ſee that she took no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in hearing them, and if any thing was capable of moving her, it could be nothing but thoſe Sentiments that he ſhould take up for her Friend. He was troubled at that indifferency, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd ſeiz'd with ſo great a Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that he deſiſted from ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her. Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd ſooner than she had thought to do, and Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> went to Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac,</hi> whoſe Deſpair increas'd by her Preſence. She made a loud and ſorrowful Out cry when she ſaw her: <hi>Ah! you have betray'd me,</hi> ſaid she, <hi>I at leaſt thought that the Count was ignorant of my weakneſs: but there wanted ſomething more to perfect your Victory, you have found ſome ſatisfaction in that Sacrifice that he has offer'd up to you of me. I beg your pardon for diſtruſting you</hi>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:66339:63"/>
               <hi>in this thought; but why did yon tell him that I lov'd him, ſeeing he lov'd you?</hi> She had not the power to proceed, her Tears did run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly down, and she could do nothing but weep.</p>
            <p>Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed part of what had paſs'd, she had nothing to anſwer her, and it was then a fit time to juſtifie her intentions, when she was guilty through ſuch ſad Effects; all that she could ſay or do, was to aſſure her that it would be eaſie to take off of the Count the thoughts of being belov'd; but the Remedy was not yet according to Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of <hi>Sanſac</hi>'s mind: <hi>No.</hi> ſaid she, <hi>let him know it, and I ſhall never ſee him more.</hi> Upon this she did riſe from the Bed, and went from Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> with the deſign of never returning there again; and the next day she went to one of her Father's Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:66339:64"/>
which was near the City of <hi>Tours.</hi> There ſhe did endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to forget all the World, she abandon'd the deſign of purſuing the Marriage of her Brother with Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> though it might have been of uſe to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd her ſelf of <hi>Amboiſe;</hi> and all her Sentiments yielded to her ſhame: Thus she left to that Friend nothing but the vexation of having loſt a Perſon, unto whom she intruſted her Sentiments, and of preſerving ſtill an unhappy Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi>'s Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was ſo cruel to Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> through its Conſequences, that ſhe began to fancy it a Crime in him; she would no longer ſpeak to him, but with a kind of ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, againſt which he was not prepar'd. He had not thought that she would ill treat him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could love none but her.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:66339:64"/>
There enter'd in that new rigour a kind of injuſtice and contempt, which ſeem'd to him not to be born withal; he fanſied that he could live without loving a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whoſe ingratitude deſerv'd his hatred, or rather his forgetting of her, and he began to ſhun her more than he had ever done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sanſac</hi> was deſperate at his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's abſence; he had no longer any body near his Father that ſpoke for him; ſo that after he had writ to Madmoiſelle of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſac</hi> all to no purpoſe, he went to ſeek her where she was. He did all he could to oblige her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, but he obtain'd nothing from her, and he could not put her one moment out of that deadly grief in which she was plung'd.</p>
            <p>Madam of <hi>Tournon,</hi> who ſaw him extreamly afflicted, and who thought of ſome means of reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him from Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:66339:65"/>
feign'd a new Earneſtneſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns for his Intereſt; ſhe told him, that one of her Friends that had a full power over the Count of <hi>Sanſac</hi>'s mind, would ſoon be at <hi>Paris,</hi> and that ſhe would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all the Credit that ſhe had in that Friend, to bring about the Marqueſs's Deſigns.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sanſac</hi> was ſenſible, that of truth that Perſon, of whom ſhe ſpoke, was a conſiderable Perſon with his Father: What a pleaſure is it to behold a means to attain unto that Happineſs which he had ſo long waited after! The ſtrength of his Sentiments gave him again ſome friendſhip for that Counteſs. He promis'd her an eternal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, and he frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her with aſſiduity.</p>
            <p>She had introduc'd the Count of <hi>Sancerre</hi> at Madam of <hi>Roye</hi>'s: He was of a Character of mind to pleaſe all thoſe that he frequented
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:66339:65"/>
with; he went fequently there, and his Love did daily increaſe, through the particular knowledge which he found of Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi>'s Wit; that Paſſion was even inflam'd by that which he knew ſhe had for the Marqueſs of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſac.</hi> It often happens that a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſets a value on the Merit of a Miſtreſs, which makes, that when he cannot cauſe her to be hated, he cauſes her to be infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd.</p>
            <p>Though Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> did avoid Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> it was not poſſible, but that he ſhould ſometimes meet her, and it was above a month ſince he had ſeen her, when that he found himſelf near her Perſon one day that the Queen Regent was receiving of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadours. So ſoon as he perceiv'd Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> his firſt Deſign was to have chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged place; but ſhe ſaluted him
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:66339:66"/>
after a manner, which though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, had a Charm by which he found himſelf detain'd; mean time he durſt not ſpeak to her, but when the Ceremony was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the men gave their hands to the Ladies to lead them to their Coaches. The Marqueſs of <hi>Sanſac</hi> was oblig'd to take that of Madam of <hi>Roye,</hi> and Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> ſaid to Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> that he durſt not offer her his; ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd nothing, and offer'd her hand to him with Civility.</p>
            <p>Never had Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> been ſo adorn'd, and ſo beautiful: Thoſe Applauſes which ſhe had receiv'd, caus'd a modeſt Joy to appear on her Face, which would have excited Love in the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible Hearts. Though <hi>Sanſac</hi>'s Paſſion was arriv'd at that height, that it could not be increas'd, he had felt a new pleaſure in behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her that day. <hi>D'Amboiſe</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:66339:66"/>
the firſt time that he had ſeen her; which forc'd from him a profound ſigh, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held her with Eyes bedew'd with Tears.</p>
            <p>There being great Apartments to go through, and divers Perſons having ſtep'd in between Madam and Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> he had full leiſure to entertain her. <hi>I am aſham'd, Madmoiſelle,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to let you know that your ſcorns and your hatred cannot hinder me from loving you: What further means will you attempt? they will all prove uſeleſs, there is nothing but death can rid you of me. You had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd me,</hi> ſaid Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye, that you would uſe no more ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes to me, what would you that I ſhould anſwer you? Nothing, Madmoiſelle,</hi> ſaid he with an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended countenance, <hi>I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd but your indifferency. Well,</hi> added he, quite tranſported, <hi>return</hi>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:66339:67"/>
               <hi>me that, ſince I am ſo unhappy, as to think that your anger is yet a greater evil to me. But,</hi> ſaid Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of Roye, <hi>ought you to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd at my reſentment? You are the cauſe that I have loſt my Friend. What of Madmoiſelle,</hi> interrupted he, <hi>can you accuſe me? Did I ever go about to touch her Heart? Was it poſſible for me to love any one but you? No, Madmoiſelle,</hi> added he, as beyond himſelf, <hi>you owe me no tenderneſs, I deteſt mine; but I love you, and I am worthy of your pity. Complain not then,</hi> ſaid Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of Roye, <hi>I have given you what I could give you, and ſetting aſide Love, you have had all my other Sentiments, I promiſe you the continuance of them, and let us no longer reproach one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Count' had no cauſe to be contented, but he had no right to complain. He put her into her Mother's Coach, where <hi>Sanſac</hi> was
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:66339:67"/>
waiting. The two Lovers ſaluted one another with a ſmile, which expreſs'd all the Sentiments of their Hearts. <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> who had feign'd not to look on Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> had however taken notice of it, and he was pier'd at it with a mortal Sorrow; then did his evil become extream, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to cure himſelf. He found that he ſhould always be expos'd to ſeek Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> to meet her, and to ſuffer all that a deſperate Love and Jealouſie have that is moſt dreadful; ſo that ſeeing it was neceſſary he ſhould quit <hi>Paris;</hi> he went to an Eſtate which he had near <hi>Reims,</hi> and promis'd himſelf never to return, till he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd all the remainders of his unfortunate Paſſion. Thus was Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> deliver'd for a time from a Lover who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be troubleſom to her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe had ſome conſiderations
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:66339:68"/>
for him, and that ſhe durſt not ill treat him.</p>
            <p>But the Count of <hi>Sancerre</hi> and Madam of <hi>Tournon,</hi> from whom ſhe had never fear'd any thing, were the Perſons who were to cauſe all the evils and misfortunes of her life. <hi>Sancerre</hi> deſign'd to get into her Favour, before he declar'd himſelf her Lover; ſo that he had began to enter into ſome Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with her, in ſpeaking fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of <hi>Sanſac,</hi> and in favour of that Name he rendred himſelf amiable; ſhe entertain'd him with a ſatisfaction which was even ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to <hi>Sanſac,</hi> he fear'd to find a Rival in a man who appear'd for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable, and who was aſſiduous at Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi>'s; he own'd his Suſpicions to her, but ſhe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd him ſo firmly, that he was but a Friend, and ſhe was ſo well perſwaded of it her ſelf, that ſhe even made no reflexions on <hi>Sanſac</hi>'s
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:66339:68"/>
diſquiets. Of truth, he had ſo much reaſon to aſſure himſelf of Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi>'s inclinations, that he was willing at firſt to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his Jealouſie to her.</p>
            <p>Madam of <hi>Tournon,</hi> who by the Promiſes which ſhe had made him of employing her ſelf in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of his Marriage, had thereby engag'd him to be obliging to her, caus'd to be ſpread abroad by the Count of <hi>Sancerre,</hi> that the Marqueſs was fallen in Love with her. Though Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> was advertis'd of the Reaſons he had to manage her; That Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs was ſtill brisk enough to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſome uneaſie thoughts in a Rival.</p>
            <p>Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> inform'd <hi>Sanſac</hi> of what was ſaid of him, he remain'd in a Surpriſe, which appear'd very natural; he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her after ſo tender a manner, and he did love her ſo ſincerely,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:66339:69"/>
that he could not fail of being ſoon juſtified. He offer'd to break off with Madam of <hi>Tournon,</hi> but they both thought they had the ſame intereſt to preſerve her their Friend. She at laſt deſired him not to alter his Conduct, and aſſur'd him, that ſhe ſhould never be concern'd at it.</p>
            <p>Her Jealouſie appear'd ſo tender to her Lover, that in that very inſtant he loſt that which he had had of <hi>Sancerre;</hi> he was even ſo aſham'd, for having miſtruſted of infidelity ſo nice a Heart, that he fear'd putting her in mind of thoſe fears which he had expreſs'd; but that quiet laſted not long, Madam of <hi>Tournon</hi> deſigning that they ſhould both at one and the ſame time entertain Suſpicions one of another, gain'd to her Party that Woman of Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi>'s, in whom ſhe put the greateſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; ſhe gave her a Letter
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:66339:69"/>
which was directed to Madmoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> but ſhe intreated her not to ſhew it to her, and ſo to contrive the buſineſs, that <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſac</hi> might read it, without any ſign that there had been any deſign he ſhould ſee it.</p>
            <p>Chance did favour her intention ſome few days after, and the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was punctually done. <hi>Sanſac</hi> came one Enening to Madam of <hi>Roye</hi>'s, ſhe was not there, ſome of her Friends waited ſome time for her return, but that day ſhe was to ſup with her Daughter at Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam of <hi>Tournon</hi>'s; mean time this Woman ſeign'd as if ſhe knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, ſhe told <hi>Sanſac</hi> that they would ſoon return, and ſhe would have him to go into Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam of <hi>Roye</hi>'s Apartment, of which ſhe had deſignedly miſlay'd the Key, to have occaſion of leading him in that of Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi>'s. She had newly carried that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:66339:70"/>
Letter there, with which she had charg'd her ſelf; it lay on the Table unſealed, and ſeem'd as if it had been forgotten. She left the Marqueſs alone, who read the Letter which was of the Count of <hi>Sancerre</hi>'s hand, whoſe Writing <hi>Sanſac</hi> knew. <hi>Sancerre</hi> by that Letter did confeſs to Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> that he had a long time thought to be no more but a Friend to her; that therefore he had diſguis'd his real Sentiments under that notion, but now he could no longer forbear letting her know them. <hi>Sanſac</hi> read it with the ſame vexation, as if in learning the Count's Love, he had alſo learn'd that he was belov'd.</p>
            <p>That Woman return'd into the Chamber, when she thought he might have read the Letter, and she told him that Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> had newly ſent back her
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:66339:70"/>
people, and that she ſhould paſs that Evening at Madam of <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>'s. He immediately went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not doubting but that <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerre</hi> would be there; yet having at a diſtance obſerv'd his Liveries at the door, he was ſtruck at that ſight, as if he did not expect it. He went into Madam of <hi>Tournon</hi>'s, to ſee in what manner Madmoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> would govern her ſelf with her new Lover; but she having not ſeen the Letter, which could inform her of this Count's Sentiments, she therefore alter'd not her former Conduct towards him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sanſac</hi> was almoſt mad to ſee her in her uſual Gayety; his Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie did perſwade him that it was rather increas'd: Never had he found thoſe things which <hi>Sancerre</hi> ſaid, ſo unfit to pleaſe, and he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did ſo much fear leſt they ſhould pleaſe; at laſt he went out
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:66339:71"/>
in the moſt furious trouble that he ever had been in his life. The next day he could not ſee Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> alone, and the day following they ſet forth for <hi>Reims</hi> at the Coronation of <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth.</p>
            <p>A conſiderable time had already paſs'd ſince the death of <hi>Francis</hi> the Second; Pleaſures began to ſpring up again at Court, and of truth they had ſcarce diſcontinu'd, becauſe it was the Queen Regent's pleaſure, who would be abſolute, to keep all things in Idleneſs and Wantonneſs; she grac'd every day with ſome Feſtival; and being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways follow'd by the moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Women, who made their Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to act according to their Will, she reign'd with a full Authority by the means of Gallantry.</p>
            <p>Madam of <hi>Roye,</hi> whom a ſlight indiſpoſition did oblige to ſtay at <hi>Paris,</hi> would have retain'd her
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:66339:71"/>
Daughter with her, but the Queen deſired not to deprive her of a Perſon who adorn'd her Court; ſo that she intruſted Madam of <hi>Tournon</hi> with her, who she ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd to be the moſt ſincere of all her Friends. Her Daughter had not told her the diſtruſt which she had of that Counteſs; for fear she had found them too little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable.</p>
            <p>During the Journey Madam of <hi>Tournon</hi> did obſerve Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> and on the pretence of Friendſhip, did not leave her one moment: That Letter which <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſac</hi> had read, having not been writ to any other end, but that he ſhould ſee it, Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> had not heard one word of it. <hi>Sancerre</hi> was ſtill cautious of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her any Suſpicion that he lov'd her. His Rival was firſt to be deſtroy'd, and he was content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in labouring joyntly with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:66339:72"/>
of <hi>Tournon</hi> to ſow a diſcord betwixt thoſe two Lovers, and in preventing them from coming to a right Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>Madam of <hi>Tournon</hi> had told <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſac,</hi> that though she was willing to ſerve him in his Marriage near his Father, she would not enter with Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> in the confidence of his Love, and that it was not convenient for her to act in any thing of that nature with a young Perſon. He could not blame her for it, and he the leſs ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that she were capable of, taking another Intereſt in him, than that of Friendſhip. This Marqueſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd to entertain a Jealouſie in his Boſom. He ſaw that Madmoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> did not break off with <hi>Sancerre,</hi> and he already judg'd her too guilty, to merit his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, but he expreſs'd an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary coldneſs towards her; she attributed it to his new paſſion
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:66339:72"/>
for the Counteſs, and she preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a ſecret ſpight at it, which appear'd not at firſt but by her coldneſs, but it was impoſſible for them to remain long in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. They were mutually ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious of one another, which muſt have turn'd into Certainties, or they muſt have clear'd themſelves of their doubts: There happen'd an Adventure which made an end of confounding them.</p>
            <p>The Queen gave a Ball at <hi>Reims</hi> the night of <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth's Coronation. It being the time of Maſquerading, she gave the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of a Maſquerade; she order'd that a Troop of Gipſie men, and another of Gipſie women, ſhould come ſeparately to tell the young King's good Fortune; that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards each man ſhould take his Gipſie woman, and that they ſhould dance together, as rejoycing for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving hit ſo right in ſpeaking plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing things to the King.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:66339:73"/>The Counteſs of <hi>Tournon,</hi> and Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> were of the Maſquerade; their height was pretty equal, their Hairs were of a brown very approaching, and their ſmall difference could not be diſcern'd by the light of Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaus, thoſe Gipſies Dreſſes were order'd after a manner as made no diſtinction betwixt any perſons that had never ſo little likeneſs; long flying Gowns did cover all their Necks, and deſcended to the ground, without any diſtinction in height; their Hairs, which were looſe on their ſhoulders, were tied up with a world of Ribands, and the Ladies made their Lovers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of thoſe which they were to wear that Feſtival-day, becauſe the Queen, who would entertain every thing in Gallantry, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired it ſhould be ſo, that thoſe who had Miſtreſſes might dance with them. Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:66339:73"/>
found her ſelf uneaſie in that Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, that coldneſs which was betwixt <hi>Sanſac</hi> and her, gave her ſome repugnancy againſt doing him that favour; mean time it was impoſſible for her to afford it to another, that favour appear'd to her little conſiderable in it ſelf, and it produc'd an occaſion for her to accuſe him, which ſhe would not neglect; She ſent him ſome of her Ribands, and writ to him with ſo much ſpight, ſorrow, and tenderneſs, that this Letter had aſſuredly produc'd a clearing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betwixt them, had not Madam of <hi>Tournon</hi>'s Artifice prevail'd.</p>
            <p>The Note that ſhe had writ, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving paſs'd through the hands of that Woman that Madam of <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> had gain'd; ſhe had a ſight of it, and found out ſome way of playing a new Trick to thoſe two Lovers; ſhe kept Madmoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle of <hi>Roye</hi>'s Ribands, and ſent
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:66339:74"/>
others in the name of that young Perſon, they were of thoſe that ſhe her ſelf was to wear. Her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was to deceive <hi>Sanſac,</hi> and to paſs for Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> under the favour of the diſguiſe, to put that Miſtreſs in the higheſt indignation againſt <hi>Sanſac,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them as much as ſhe could, from clearing themſelves, and that the miſtake of the Ribands might be thrown on the Woman that ſerv'd them, ſhould they go about to examine the matter. Mean time, ſhe her ſelf found the deſign but courſe, and expected no great ſucceſs from it; but ſhe had began to ſow a miſunderſtanding amongſt them, all was to be hazarded that could increaſe it; and their hearts being already prepoſſeſt with Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, the leaſt appearance might add ſomething to their general Revolt.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:66339:74"/>
               <hi>Sanſac</hi> receiv'd Madam of <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>'s Ribands, which were ſent him as from Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> and he writ to this laſt with ſo much Love and Jealouſie, that Madam of <hi>Tournon,</hi> unto whom that Letter was ſhew'd, did at the ſame time fear and hope of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; ſhe entreated that Woman, whom ſhe had gain'd, to have <hi>Sanſac</hi> inform'd, that Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> would ſpeak to him the Maſquerading night, and ſhe had reſolv'd to tell him under the ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of her Mask, ſuch things as would convince him that his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val was belov'd; the Letters which they writ to one another were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted, and Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> was only told, that <hi>Sanſac</hi> was moſt oblig'd to her for her Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands; that ſlight which ſhe had ſo little deſerv'd from him, put her into an unconceivable Anger. She was at firſt ſurpris'd with that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:66339:75"/>
ſtrange way of proceeding, tho' her mind had long ſince been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd by the extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency which he had ſhew'd her, for all things appear ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly true to Jealouſie. How often did she accuſe her ſelf of lowneſs of Spirit, for having made an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance ſo ill receiv'd; that which had at firſt appear'd ſo indifferent, did then ſeem moſt terrible to her; and her grief had prevented her from appearing at the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade, if she had not had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee after what manner he would govern himſelf there.</p>
            <p>The Maskers did dance, each Gipſie woman with that man who bore her Colours. Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> ſaw a perſon who wore hers, and at firſt she did not know him to be the Brother of Madam of <hi>Tournon,</hi> who was to dance with that Counteſs, but she eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd that it was not <hi>Sanſac</hi> that danc'd with her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:66339:75"/>That Marqueſs was not made after a manner that could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with the reſt, he was tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler than all thoſe that were of the Maſquerade; ſo that she perceiv'd him dreſs'd with Madam of <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>'s Colours, which she could not but know, becauſe they had dreſs'd together, <hi>Sanſac,</hi> who took her for Madam of <hi>Roye,</hi> deceiv'd by the Ribands, which had been ſent him as from her, continu'd to dance with her, and she ſo well affected the Air and Dancing of her whom she would imitate, that the Marqueſs, who had no Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of the Cheat, was wholly miſtaken.</p>
            <p>Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> felt the greateſt vexation that she ever had in her life; she did believe that the Counteſs had alſo ſent ſome of her Ribands to <hi>Sanſac,</hi> to have the pleaſure of ſeeing her ſelf highly prefer'd before the other;
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:66339:76"/>
in the diſpoſition ſhe was, ſhe needed not ſo much to convince her, that <hi>Sanſac</hi> and Madam of <hi>Tournon</hi> were in a perfect Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and the trouble of her mind did make her dance with ſo much diſorder, that no body could ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that it was ſhe.</p>
            <p>After ſhe had made a review of all the Perſons of the Maſquerade, ſhe found that it was with the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Madam of <hi>Tournon</hi> that ſhe had danc'd, ſhe did not exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether <hi>Sanſac</hi> had deſign'd to deceive her in putting ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in his place, or whether he had only thought of ſhifting himſelf out of buſineſs; but either way ſhe thought her ſelf treated in ſo ill a manner, that the Love which ſhe owed to her ſelf, was almoſt as much offended, as was her ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs to <hi>Sanſac.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So ſoon as the Maſquerading was ended, ſhe privately got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:66339:76"/>
the door, and went out, without being perceiv'd but by <hi>Sancerre</hi> only, who had always had his Eyes upon her, and who knew her by the Ribands which Madam of <hi>Tournon</hi> had intercept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and had ſhew'd him. He fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd her out to give her his hand, and she was oblig'd to him for that Civility; she told him, that she ſhould not return again, ſo that he conducted her home. He had too much intereſt not to learn what paſs'd in her Heart as to <hi>Sanſac,</hi> wherefore he fell on that Diſcourſe, believing that in the diſorder she was, it was the fitteſt time for him to give his Rival the laſt blow; he feign'd with a kind of a myſterious Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, that he was not wholly ſurpris'd at what had happen'd; that was enough to engage Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> even againſt her inclination, to make him divers
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:66339:77"/>
Queſtions, unto which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd after a manner which did infinitely increaſe her Jealouſie and Sorrow; though she had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd a thouſand Suſpicions, she ſtill accus'd her ſelf of having ſhut her own Eyes, and for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving remain'd in too great a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity at the very inſtant that she was betray'd. She could not be weary in continually making him new Queſtions, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd longer with her, than she would have permitted him to do, had she been leſs diſturb'd.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>Sanſac</hi> had done dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing with Madam of <hi>Tournon,</hi> whom he had all the while taken for Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> he led her to a Corner of the Hall to ſpeak to her; she did not pull off her Mask, which was faſtned to her Head-dreſs, ſo that he could not undeceive himſelf. He told her, that he was in a world of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:66339:77"/>
Sorrow at the hearing that <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerre</hi> had writ to her, and dar'd to acquaint her with his Paſſion, that he found she had not ill treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for it, that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, she beheld him with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; and finally, that he could no longer live, if she continu'd to have the ſame regard for him. Madam of <hi>Tournon</hi> counterfeiting the accent of her Voice, told him that it was difficult for her to break with a Friend of her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Ah! Madmoiſelle,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>what is it that you tell me? Why do you alarm your ſelf?</hi> ſaid she with a Tone more diſguis'd than before. <hi>Though it ſhould be true, that</hi> Sancerre <hi>ſhould have other Sentiments for me, than thoſe of Eſteem and Friendſhip, you ought not to believe that I ſhould have any others for him. How? Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle,</hi> reply'd he, <hi>is it poſſible that you ſhould have ſome Eſteem</hi>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:66339:78"/>
               <hi>and Friendſhip for a man who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares himſelf your Lover? I am loſt, if you do not unſay thoſe words again. I ſhall not unſay them,</hi> ſaid Madam of <hi>Tournon, there would be injuſtice in what you demand. That is too much,</hi> interrupted Sanſac, <hi>either deceive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> me quite, or make an end of undeceiving me, I cannot remain in that uncertainty I am; ſay that you love</hi> Sancerre, <hi>that you cannot break off with him, and I ſhall no longer trouble you with my Jealouſie and my reproaches.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam of <hi>Tournon</hi> made him no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. <hi>I underſtand you, Madam,</hi> ſaid <hi>Sanſac</hi> tranſported with Fury, <hi>you ſhall no longer be troubled with my Complaints, but in vain muſt you expect any moderation in my Conduct, and ſo long as I have life, I will prevent my Rival from being more happy than my ſelf.</hi> Upon that he roughly quitted her, and she made no offers of retaining him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:66339:78"/>Madmoiſelle of <hi>Tournon</hi> was in an exceſſive Joy, she could never have hoped for ſuch a Succeſs, and all her Arts were ſo fortunate, that they gave her no remorſes. Tho' the Maſquerade was ended, the Ball did continue; Madam of <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> after she had chang'd her Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, return'd into the Hall, where they danc'd; <hi>Sanſac</hi> was gone in to ſeek after <hi>Sancerre,</hi> and to oblige him to fight, but he found him not there, and he learnt that Madam of <hi>Tournon</hi> had ſaid, that Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired with a moſt violent Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach. Of truth, Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> had given it out ſo, that none ſhould be ſurpris'd at her not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing at the Ball. This Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, not finding <hi>Sancerre,</hi> did believe he might have follow'd her, and it was impoſſible for him not to ſeek to be ſatisfied in it. He went to Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi>'s,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:66339:79"/>
under the pretence of inquiring after her Health, and having learnt by <hi>Sancerre</hi>'s folks that he was there, he demanded to ſee her, with a deſign to make her, maugre his Promiſe, all the reproaches which he thought she deſerv'd; but that Anger Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> was in, hindred her from receiving him, she ſent him Word that she could not ſpeak with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of her Head-ach, at the ſame time she diſmiſs'd <hi>Sancerre;</hi> but he apprehending that <hi>Sanſac</hi> had ſeen his Servants, and fancying that peradventure his Rival would have the Curioſity to learn whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhould be long with Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> he remain'd in the Antichamber on purpoſe with that Woman, which Madmoiſelle of <hi>Tournon</hi> had gain'd, Madmoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> not knowing but that he was gone, nor ſo much as once thinking that he would remain there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:66339:79"/>
               <hi>Sanſac</hi> ſtay'd for him in his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, agitated with all that Fury could ſuggeſt to him of moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid; he perceiv'd the Count of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> coming, and in the trouble that he was, he could not forbear ſpeaking to him. <hi>D'Amboiſe</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been oblig'd to repair to <hi>Reims</hi> about the King's Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he had heard that Madmoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> was ill, and he had found himſelf ſtill ſenſible enough in what concern'd her, to come with earneſtneſs to inform himſelf of her health. <hi>You ſee a man that is deſperate,</hi> ſaid <hi>Sanſac</hi> ſo ſoon as he did ſee him, <hi>you have plung'd me into that Abyſs where I am, and you have drawn your ſelf out of it; You have yielded to me a Perſon, which cauſes all the misfortune of my life; ſhe loves</hi> Sancerre, <hi>he is at this preſent with her, and ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes ſeeing me. I have nothing to anſwer you,</hi> ſaid Monſieur of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boiſe,</hi>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:66339:80"/>
               <hi>I forgot Madmoiſelle of</hi> Roye <hi>when I yielded her to you.</hi> Upon this <hi>D'Amboiſe</hi> perceiv'd the Count of <hi>Sancerre</hi> coming out the Houſe, which made him too haſtily leave <hi>Sanſac,</hi> for fear his Looks ſhould betray what he had newly ſaid.</p>
            <p>Into what an odd kind of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie did that Count enter? He fancy'd that Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> had a ſecond time prov'd incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to him, ſhe had been forc'd by her inclination to love <hi>Sanſac; D'Amboiſe</hi> did begin to believe that ſhe would always love that Perſon, whom ſhe had from the beginning preferr'd to him, and that had in ſome manner allay'd the firſt heat of his Sentiments; but that Change did awaken them, and kindled in him new deſires, ſpight, and tranſportment. He believ'd that ſhe might be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and he eſteem'd her the leſs, but he acquired new fires by it,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:66339:80"/>
he found himſelf full of earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to revenge himſelf of that Perſon who went about to deprive him of a good, which he thought to be already loſt, but he alſo fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy'd that there was a kind of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in revenging ones ſelf, which did not agree with a man who had never been belov'd, he was aſham'd that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd at the Quarrels which were betwixt <hi>Sanſac</hi> and <hi>Sancerre</hi> for Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> which made him to return into the Country that very moment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sanſac</hi> having inform'd <hi>Sancerre</hi> that his deſign was to fight with him, they went at ſome diſtance from that place, for fear of being prevented: they fought with an equal fierceneſs, and they had ended their quarrel with their lives, if that their Servants, whom they had forbid to follow them, had not diſtruſted their intentions,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:66339:81"/>
and given notice of it to ſome of their Friends, who came and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them.</p>
            <p>Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> was ſome days without going out of her Chamber, under the pretence of an Head-ach, ſo that ſhe would not ſee <hi>Sanſac.</hi> This Marqueſs's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat with <hi>Sancerre</hi> made much noiſe at Court, but the Subject of it was not known; <hi>Sancerre</hi> had great reaſon to conceal it, ſo long as he was not firmly eſtabliſh'd in Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi>'s Favour. Madam of <hi>Tournon</hi> inſinuated het ſelf with <hi>Sanſac</hi> on that account, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd him to Secrecy, ſaying, that he ought to have ſome regards for a Perſon whom he had lov'd ſo long, but in truth it was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> from diving too deep into the buſineſs, had ſhe known what ſhare ſhe had in it. <hi>Sanſac</hi> did follow that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe's Advices, though his Anger
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:66339:81"/>
againſt Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> was not diminiſhed. He in vain did endeavour to ſuppreſs his Paſſion; he hated Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> yet he inceſſantly thought on her. It is by forgetting that Love is cur'd.</p>
            <p>Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of <hi>Sancerre</hi> the cauſe of his Combat with <hi>Sanſac,</hi> he told her that the Marqueſs had quarrell'd with him on a very ſlight pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, but that the true cauſe of his Quarrel was his meeting him too often to his mind at Madam of <hi>Tournon</hi>'s, for whoſe Perſon he could not be perſwaded that one could entertain ſo little as a ſingle Friendſhip. Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> ſwallow'd down that Poiſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſiſtance, nothing now could defend <hi>Sanſac</hi> in her heart againſt thoſe ſurpriſing News, and ſhe was eaſily brought to believe any thing of him on Madam of <hi>Tournon</hi>'s ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:66339:82"/>
which gave a great deal of hopes to his Rival.</p>
            <p>Madam of <hi>Tournon,</hi> ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd to expreſs the ſame Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> as formerly, but it was receiv'd with a great deal of coldneſs. Thoſe two Rivals would no longer men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Marqueſs of <hi>Sanſac</hi> in their Diſcourſes, and it was but the affecting of not pronouncing his Name, which was a trouble to them.</p>
            <p>The Count of <hi>Sanſac,</hi> Father to the Marqueſs, was Governour of <hi>Touraine;</hi> he was ſick at <hi>Tours,</hi> and in that Age which no longer will afford any hopes of Cure. The Reverſion of his Government was at that time conferr'd upon his Son, through Madam of <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>'s means; he, knowing not that ſhe was the cauſe of all the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in his Amours, was willing to acknowledge that obligation to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:66339:82"/>
her, but he was oblig'd to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, he told her the neceſſity that he had of flying from Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> and the Counteſs did not oppoſe his deſign of going to <hi>Tours.</hi> Abſence was the means to prevent him from clearing any Points with Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> and of curing himſelf of his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards her.</p>
            <p>This Marqueſs went ſuddenly from <hi>Reims,</hi> and ſome few days after the Court return'd to <hi>Paris.</hi> Madam of <hi>Tournon</hi> took great care to have Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of the great ſhare which ſhe had had in <hi>Sanſac</hi>'s late Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of truth he wanted a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that had a great intereſt in the Queen, to engage her to ſhew any Favour to that Family.</p>
            <p>Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> was retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into her Mother's hands, unto whom ſhe learnt that Madmoiſelle of <hi>Tournon</hi> was her Rival, and that
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:66339:83"/>
ſhe had betray'd her. Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> was ſomething troubled at <hi>Sanſac</hi>'s Change; the Engagement in which divers Perſons knew that he was with Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> had put by a great number of Pretenders, and his infidelity could not but do her ſome preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> did ſenſibly feel the Affront, and could not conſolate her ſelf for not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lov'd <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> who had ſo real a Paſſion for her, and whoſe great Qualities and Conſtancy ought to have diverted her from that inclination which ſhe had for <hi>Sanſac.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Count of <hi>Sancerre,</hi> who ſtill was with her under the notion of a Friend, did think it a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſeaſon to declare his Paſſion, though not fit to make any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of his long concealment of it; but he reſiſted the deſire of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it a merit. He fear'd bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:66339:83"/>
on himſelf that Anger which ſhe had againſt <hi>Sanſac,</hi> if he ſhould let her know that he had all along been his Rival, and of making her to ſuſpect thoſe things which he had ſaid of him; ſo that he feign'd the beginning of a Paſſion, which the opportunity of daily ſeeing a beautiful Perſon that had no En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, had produc'd.</p>
            <p>Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> had found her ſelf too much diſoblig'd by Love to admit it a ſecond time; and if her Heart could ever be mov'd with it again, it could not be but an acknowledgment on Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi>'s account; ſhe anſwer'd <hi>Sancerre</hi> with that indifferency, which a Lover thinks more unſufferable than Anger it ſelf. And from that very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he did dread all the ill that he might expect from it; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever being not quite daſh'd out of countenance, he ſpoke to her more than once.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:66339:84"/>Her Love was tired with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining it ſelf; he importun'd, if he could not pleaſe; ſo that Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> was oblig'd to let him know, that if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd his Diſcourſes, ſhe ſhould never ſee him more. She told it him with ſuch a calmneſs of mind, that he doubted not but that ſhe would make good her Threatning, and he was ſo vexed at it, that he would ſee her no more.</p>
            <p>In vain did the Count of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boiſe</hi> ſeek in the Country for a quiet, which he had fail'd of the firſt time, a new reaſon of curing himſelf did but increaſe his pain: The Count of <hi>Sancerre,</hi> Madmoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> and <hi>Sanſac,</hi> did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly preſent themſelves to his imagination, and tormented him. He return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> drawn thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his unquietneſs, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing to what purpoſe; he did not preſently go to Madam of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:66339:84"/>
               <hi>Roye</hi>'s, and he was abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to avoid ſeeing of her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; mean time having inquired what ſhe did, he learnt that <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerre</hi> had deſiſted ſeeing of her, and he was told at the ſame time, that it was becauſe that Count was fallen in Love with her; that his Paſſion had been a trouble to her; and that in fine, ſhe had in a manner baniſh'd him. As things indifferent are ſeldom conceal'd, Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> had confeſs'd the truth of that buſineſs to ſome of her Friends, who had inquired after the Reaſons that <hi>Sancerre</hi> did ſee her no more; and <hi>D'Amboiſe,</hi> who ſought after the knowledge of thoſe things, could not fail of being inform'd; by that means he loſt all Suſpicion as to the Count of <hi>Sancerre,</hi> by whom he had been more alarm'd, than really made jealous; he believ'd that Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> had only deſign'd
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:66339:85"/>
to fret <hi>Sanſac,</hi> but not to betray him, when ſhe refus'd to ſee him after the Maſquerading at <hi>Reims,</hi> and when ſhe had receiv'd <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerre,</hi> that it might only be the conſequences of a Love-quarrel, which he might not have heard of, and it was but too eaſie to him to turn all his Anger upon <hi>Sanſac;</hi> but he ſoon learnt alſo, that that Marqueſs was fallen in Love with Madam of <hi>Tournon,</hi> and that News did produce in him divers agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in which he went no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at firſt than to know what Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi>'s thoughts were on that Subject; after which he return'd to her Houſe with much earneſtneſs.</p>
            <p>Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> receiv'd him with her uſual Civilities, and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> appear'd melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick, but civil and full of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards; there being ſome Perſons in the Chamber, he could not
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:66339:85"/>
enter into any particular Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with her that day, but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe obſerv'd that he lov'd her ſtill; ſhe made ſome reflexions on his proceedings, and on thoſe of <hi>Sanſac;</hi> ſhe oppos'd the Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the one to the Inconſtancy of the other; and though ſuch advantageous thoughts in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of <hi>D'Amboiſe,</hi> did not yet carry along with them Madmoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle of <hi>Roye</hi>'s Heart, it was much however that ſhe allow'd him ſo entire a preference in her mind.</p>
            <p>The firſt time that he ſaw her alone, he would have ſpoken of <hi>Sanſac;</hi> but ſhe preſently avoided the Diſcourſe by a ſecret confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which ſhe was in at her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abandon'd by a man whom ſhe had preferr'd before him; mean time he let her underſtand, that he was not ignorant of what was ſaid of <hi>Sanſac</hi>'s Change, and it was after a manner, that in ſome
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:66339:86"/>
degree did qualifie Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi>'s diſorder: She ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteem'd this Count to oblige her to be ſincere with him. <hi>Take the pleaſure of revenging your ſelf of me,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I ought to let you enjoy that Triumph; Well, it is true, I know that</hi> Sanſac <hi>does leave me for Madam of</hi> Tournon. <hi>Is it poſſible, Madmoiſelle,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>can that be? Though it has been told me, though you confirm it, I too much know the impoſſibility of ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from loving you, to be brought to believe it. There is nothing more true,</hi> ſaid ſhe; <hi>but what is therein that is incredible? There are nothing but Examples of Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy ſeen. Madmoiſelle,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>do you ſee none other? Do you not know a Lover deſpis'd, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſtill conſtant? I know him not deſpis'd, nor hated,</hi> ſaid ſhe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, with an Air that he had not yet ſeen, <hi>I begin to make a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:66339:86"/>
               <hi>betwixt him and all other men; I was deſign'd it may be to do him juſtice one day, and that day may be come. Alas! Madmoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle, deceive not your ſelf in it, this day is ſtill one of thoſe which you give to</hi> Sanſac; <hi>and he would be the more happy for it, if he could be ſenſible of his Happineſs; though you would make me uſeful in your revenge, it would be without any favourable thoughts for me;</hi> Sanſac <hi>is very dear to you, ſeeing that his Crime does engage you to ſay ſome flattering things to his Rival.</hi> Thus did the Count of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> give Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> to underſtand, that ſhe had leſs deſign to make him ſenſible of her acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than of cauſing ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſpleaſure of <hi>Sanſac:</hi> Yet Hope was creeping again into the Count's Heart; it was a great Point got, not to have any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to fear any tenderneſs towards
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:66339:87"/>
a Rival, and to have none to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate but that of Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> which ſhe her ſelf did op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>Madam of <hi>Tournon</hi> did ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a Commerce of Letters with that Marqueſs, ſhe had got inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſo far, as to make him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, that ſhe would willingly have afforded him ſome comfort for Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi>'s infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he had ſeiz'd on that oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to endeavour to forget her, the deſire which he had ſo to do, did ſometimes make him hope that he ſhould ſucceed in it, and give a certain lively Air to his Letters, at which Madam of <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> was very well pleas'd. Mean time he did much leſs mind to perſwade her that he lov'd her, than to convince Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> of it, which he durſt not yet ſee.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:66339:87"/>The Count of <hi>Sanſac,</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ſickneſs, was a reaſon that might detain him at <hi>Tours;</hi> he did write to his Friends, that he was in Love with that Counteſs, and they no longer did mention Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had deſired them to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, without giving any reaſon for it. During the time that <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerre</hi> was ſtill number'd amongſt Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi>'s Friends; Madam of <hi>Tournon</hi> had writ to him, that they were in a perfect Intelligence, and ſince that time no body had inform'd him to the contrary. This Counteſs, which frequently receiv'd Letters from <hi>Sanſac,</hi> becauſe ſhe writ to him every day, did cauſe the moſt paſſionate of them to be ſhewn to Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> as if they had been ſurpris'd.</p>
            <p>Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> did enter into an unconceivable Anger at
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:66339:88"/>
them, and <hi>Sanſac</hi>'s inconſtancy did work more advantageouſly for Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> than all that Lover's Services could do. The Count of <hi>Sanſac</hi> dyed about that time, and his Death did ſet his Son at liberty of finiſhing his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye;</hi> but he took no advantage of it, Madam of <hi>Tournon,</hi> who no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger could perceive any other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle to it, than thoſe which ſhe produc'd, redoubled her Artifices; ſhe caus'd to be ſpred abroad, that ſhe ſhould marry that Marqueſs ſo ſoon as he ſhould return to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he was ſuddenly to be, to receive the King's Orders. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam of <hi>Tournon</hi>'s Deſign was to engage before that time Madmoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> to fix on ſome other Perſon. Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> could not bear the Affront which was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd her Daughter, ſhe told her that it concern'd their Honour to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:66339:88"/>
prevent <hi>Sanſac</hi>'s Deſigns; Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> was the moſt ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritated, and ſought after nothing but Revenge. The Mareſhal of <hi>Coſſe,</hi> at that juncture of time, did cauſe ſome Propoſitions of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to be made to her; but the diſproportion of their Age did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> to be in a Suſpence, notwithſtanding the great Advantages which ſhe might expect from that Eſtabliſhment. The Count of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> did ſtill entertain the ſame Paſſion for Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> which he ever had, tho' he had more than once given over that purſuit. But thoſe Reaſons which had oblig'd him ſo to do, were no longer exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent, nothing was more proper for that beautiful Creature, than a Perſon who had always lov'd her moſt tenderly, and whom ſhe eſteem'd above all other men. Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> did ask that
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:66339:89"/>
Count's Advice, as of a Friend, on the Mareſhal of <hi>Coſſe,</hi> at which he was ſeiz'd with ſuch a Trembling, as hindred him from anſwering. <hi>I perceive with a Surpriſe,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>that whatſoever concerns my Daughter, is not yet become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to you, mean time all that you have done already, did give me occaſion to believe that you might ſee her without trouble to marry ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; You know that I had deſign'd her for you, and that I had preferr'd you to all other men, if you would have taken advantage from thence. I have nothing to anſwer you, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>you cannot be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the diſpoſitions in which I ſhall perſiſt all my life-time for Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of</hi> Roye; <hi>I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there are; leſs obſtacles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me in her Heart, but I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my ſelf with it, and there need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not ſo much to render my Paſſion extraordinary: If you had any</hi>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:66339:89"/>
               <hi>thoughts that way, permit me to conſult Madmoiſelle of</hi> Roye <hi>on that ſubject for the laſt time. Well, pray do ſo,</hi> ſaid the Counteſs, <hi>I have the ſame Conſideration for you that I ever had.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Conjuncture was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing nice for the Count of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boiſe</hi> to act in, he had twice al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready engag'd himſelf with Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> a third time ought to make him tremble, but the Mareſhal of <hi>Coſſe</hi>'s concurrence did but him on marrying Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> to take her from him; he went and caſt himſelf at that fair Creature's feet. <hi>Madmoiſelle,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>you behold the moſt amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of all men, you know that all your rigours have not hindred me from being ſo, and what have not your Civilities done?

Your Bounties give me not boldneſs enough to make me believe, that if you were capable of diſtinctions, they might be in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of me; You have too much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed me to be unhappy, to let me gather any hopes.</hi>

               <hi>You offend me,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>by thoſe remembrances which you would bring into my mind, yet I am willing to anſwer you preciſely on the reſt; You have merited enough to invite me to ſpeak my thoughts plainly to you; and ſeeing that I cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence my ſelf from entring into ſome tie, I ſhould be ſorry if it were not with you.</hi> What a word was that for Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe?</hi> Could he make any Reflexions contrary to his Happineſs? He intreated Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> to prefer him to the Mareſhal of <hi>Coſſe;</hi> and ſhe having a great tendency to it, her Marriage was a third time reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon. It then ſeem'd to that Lover, that he had nothing more to fear, and that he was above all his misfortunes: No more Rivals: No more Obſtacles. He was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be united for ever unto a Perſon whom he had long lov'd, and by whom at laſt he believ'd
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:66339:91"/>
to be belov'd. His misfortune had laſted ſo long, that he would no longer retard his Happineſs; he intreated Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> not to let the Ceremonies of the Nuptials be any longer deferr'd. Madmoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> who through Eſteem for Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> and through a ſecret ſpight againſt <hi>Sanſac,</hi> was reſolv'd upon that Marriage, made no difficulty to conſent that it ſhould ſuddenly be ended, which was done two days after.</p>
            <p>When it was concluded on, <hi>Sanſac</hi>'s Friends had writ to him of it, not as a thing which concern'd him, but as News. What a Clap of Thunder was this for him? And what Sentiments did rekindle in his Heart? He felt that Spight, Time, and Abſence had done no more but lull'd them aſleep a little, and that it had not weaken'd them in the leaſt. He
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:66339:91"/>
did not conceive that ſhe could ever have lov'd <hi>Sancerre,</hi> and ſo ſoon marry <hi>D'Amboiſe,</hi> and that Reflexion did ſenſibly lead him to doubt, whether ſhe had ever lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the firſt of them; mean time he believ'd that ſhe had in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner offer'd it to him by her ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, he had ſeen <hi>Sancerre</hi> go out of her Houſe, when the entring into it had been refus'd him; and though all theſe Circumſtances, being recall'd into his memory, did cauſe him to ſhiver, he told himſelf that they were no Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties, that peradventure ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that he was ignorant of, had given place to thoſe Irregularities, he again did afford an Eſteem for Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> in his thoughts as oft as he fear'd to loſe her; all that which could juſtifie her came into his mind, as formerly all that could render her guilty had preſented it ſelf there; that odd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:66339:92"/>
of her marrying of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> at that time that ſhe ſhould have married <hi>Sancerre,</hi> if ſhe had lov'd him, did put him out of all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and made him to believe every thing poſſible, even not to have been betray'd. He already ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd himſelf, for having perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture given too ſoon ſome Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie to Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> of Madam of <hi>Tournon Amboiſe,</hi> who he had always thought ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing belov'd by Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> did not appear to him capable of having made himſelf Maſter with ſo much haſte of an Heart which had always been refus'd him; at other times he fanſied, that the ſame Inconſtancy which had led her to love <hi>Sancerre,</hi> might alſo lead her to love <hi>Amboiſe;</hi> but that Idea appear'd ſo cruel to him, that he would preſently caſt it off: In fine, he could unravel no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, only he found that he could
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:66339:92"/>
not ſuffer that any one ſhould be made happy by marrying of Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of <hi>Roye.</hi> He did not think that her Marriage ſhould be preform'd with ſo much precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and he ſtill hop'd to put ſome ſtops to it; mean time he could not return to <hi>Paris,</hi> as he deſired to do, becauſe that the Huguenots, with whom a Treaty of Peace had been concluded, yet without effect, had made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of divers Cities, and had Troops alſo not far from <hi>Tours,</hi> ſo that it was not poſſible for him to leave his Government; but he would not defer to let Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> know the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which her Marriage was going to reduce him, though he was ignorant of the Diſpoſitions in which ſhe was for him. He went to Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac,</hi> his Siſter, who was but two Leagues from thence; he told her
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:66339:93"/>
of that Marriage, which he knew would concern her as much as him, he did conjure her to go immediately thither, to give a Letter to Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> which he had writ, and to uſe all the means that could prevent her from marrying the Count of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac</hi>'s Paſſion was of thoſe that nothing can cure, ſhe was ſeiz'd with Wonder and with Sorrow; and though ſhe did endeavour to conceal thoſe motions, ſhe aſſur'd her Brother, that he might rely upon her as to the care of the buſineſs, which ſhe would bring about, if any could do it, and that ſhe would omit nothing that could do him Service. Upon this Aſſurance he return'd to <hi>Tour's,</hi> and ſhe thought of nothing but keeping her Word with him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:66339:93"/>She was not long about chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the quickeſt way, and that which ſeem'd to her the moſt ſure; ſhe thought that it would be in vain to have Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> perſwaded of <hi>Sanſac</hi>'s tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that though ſhe ſhould again take up her firſt Sentiments for him, they would be uſeleſs, becauſe that her timidity would always prevail over her inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that it would be more eaſie to caſt into <hi>Amboiſe</hi>'s mind ſome Scruples, which ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him to take that Party, which he had done already more than once, than to uſe any other means to break off that Marriage; that after all, it would be no ill For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to him not to marry a Perſon, which had been ſo long prepoſieſt in the behalf of <hi>Sanſac;</hi> that there was not ſcarce any occaſion to doubt but that her tenderneſs for him would awaken again, when
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:66339:94"/>
she ſhould once ſee him return to her again.</p>
            <p>Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac</hi> writ to Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> and she alſo ſent him the Letter, which <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſac</hi> had writ to Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye;</hi> she diſguis'd her own Hand, that it might not be known: thoſe Letters came from her, and she follow'd them ſome moments af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to learn what effects they might have produc'd. <hi>D'Amboiſe</hi> receiv'd them the day after his Marriage, and when he thought that his Happineſs ſhould never be troubled more, he open'd that from Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac,</hi> the Character of which he knew not, and which was conceiv'd in the following words.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>I Am inform'd that you are going to marry Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> and that News-makes ſo deep an impreſſion on me, that I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear writing to you, though I have ſo much cauſe of complaining againſt you, I am not in a condition of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king you any reproaches; I love you, and I loſe you, I am to juſtifie my ſelf, and to crave your pardon; I have feign'd loving Madam of <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> with a deſign either to cure, or rather revenge my ſelf, but I have done nothing all that while, but keep up my Paſſion by that hope. Peradventure alſo that my Conduct has diſpleas'd you. May be it has haſtned that reſolution which you take. Alas! I flatter my ſelf, I ſhould be ſtill too happy in having a ſhare in the reaſons of your Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, as fatal as it is to me. No,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:66339:95"/>
you love <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> as you have lov'd another. I ask your pardon, if I offend you; though I deſire to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend you: Cauſe that reproach to ceaſe, if it is too ſenſible to you; cauſe that inclination to revive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with which you once did flatter me, and which you ſaid was to laſt for ever. What? convey it to <hi>D'Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boiſe,</hi> after your Heart had diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd me from him in ſo obliging a manner; I oppoſe my ſelf to your Marriage, by the right which your firſt Sentiments have given me over you, and if there remains yet any thing of them, I love you enough to pretend to recal them all back again. You formerly believ'd that we were born for one another; Why part we while I love you ſtill? Ah! leave the thoughts of entring in a new En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, if not, fear the fury of a Lover who will loſe all, rather than loſe a good which he has merited both by his tenderneſs and yours.</p>

               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:66339:96"/>What an effect did the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe Letters produce in Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi>'s Heart? He found himſelf conſtrain'd to doubt whether he was belov'd at the time that he poſſeſt that Perſon which he lov'd. What an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour did preſent it ſelf to his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations? He remain'd ſuppreſt with that Idea, and his Marriage became the moſt grievous of all his evils. So long as he had been but a Lover, the entire aſſurance of not being belov'd, had appear'd leſs cruel to him, than that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty to which he ſaw himſelf reduc'd; if he had never lov'd ſo paſſionately, neither had be been ſo ſenſibly touch'd with Jealouſie, to attain to the very laſt degree of ones Wiſhes, and to behold all ones Happineſs caſt down through unſufferable Conceptions, through ſuch Doubts as could not be clear, not incapable of abandoning, nor
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:66339:96"/>
of hating the Counteſs of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> nor to love her neither, was the condition he found himſelf in, and unto which there was no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
            <p>The Counteſs of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> took notice of his coldneſs, and of his trouble; she ask'd him the cauſe of it after a manner that ought to have ſetled him; but her kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes were ſuſpicious, or rather he thought that he enjoy'd them but by Surpriſe; he was divers times on the point of ſhewing her the Letter from <hi>Sanſac,</hi> that he might no longer doubt the evil which he fear'd, and to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh on that, if it were poſſible, a moſt ſorrowful quiet; but he as often ſtopt his hand, and he felt that he had ſtill the certainty of it to fear: He anſwer'd the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs in ſuch terms as did not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie her, and which put her into extraordinary diſturbances.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:66339:97"/>When Madmoiſelle of <hi>Sanſac</hi> came to <hi>Paris,</hi> ſhe learnt that Monſieur <hi>d'Amboiſe</hi> was married to Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye;</hi> She fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the diſorder that the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which ſhe had ſent might have done, and the vexations at her imprudence, joyn'd to thoſe which ſhe had at that Marriage, made her that very day take the reſolution of going into a Monaſtery, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void reproaches from her Brother, and to have the power of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a Paſſion, which had ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Heart: She writ to the Marqueſs of <hi>Sanſac</hi> before ſhe went into it, and inform'd him, that Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> was married; She alſo confeſt, that in a deſign to ſerve him, and not knowing that the Count of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready beyond the condition of making uſe of theſe Advices, which were given him, ſhe had ſent to him that Letter which he had writ
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:66339:97"/>
to Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye,</hi> with a Note in an unknown Character, which might have brought him once again to have broken that Marriage: Finally, ſhe pray'd that Marqueſs to leave her at quiet, and never more to mention that fault to her, which ſhe was going to expiate all her life time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sanſac</hi> receiv'd not that Letter at <hi>Tours,</hi> becauſe that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Troops, who had had a deſign to ſurpriſe that City, and that had been prevented by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours vigilance, were got into <hi>Orleans,</hi> and gave him the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to return to <hi>Paris.</hi> He learnt ſo ſoon as he was got thither, that Madmoiſelle of <hi>Roye</hi> was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and he was as ſurpris'd as ſorrowful at it; though he had fear'd that Marriage, he could not perſwade himſelf that it could be done; and his Reflexions on it had but ſoftned his Heart the more,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:66339:98"/>
and rendred it more capable of feeling his loſs; far from preparing it to bear his misfortune, he aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd himſelf to all that Deſpair has of moſt horrid: But he was not long in that trouble, <hi>Amboiſe</hi> was decreed to dye with grief in the midſt of his Happineſs, and it was ſoon ſpread abroad in what danger that Count was. Monſieur of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boiſe</hi> could not bear the divers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations of his mind, a Feaver did ſeize him with ſuch an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary violence, that from the very firſt day his Life was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: The Counteſs of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> was inceſſantly by him, bathed with tears; the affliction which ſhe ſhew'd him, and the Cares which ſhe took for his preſervation, did ſenſibly move him, but this put him in Deſpair when he thought that he durſt not take them for Tokens of Love; yet he could not but be ſenſible of them. He
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:66339:98"/>
perceiv'd that Madam of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> was worthy of an infinite Eſteem, and that if he could not reach her Heart, he was to dye without complaining of her, he felt that he had but few days to live, and he reſolv'd not to mention to her thoſe Letters, which caus'd his Death, for fear of ſhewing ſome Jealouſie, and of taking from her by that means the liberty of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing her own inclination, when he ſhould be no more. That ſtrain of Generoſity did coſt him dear, his Sentiments were not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently weakned, not to oppoſe himſelf to a reſolution which was ſo contrary to them; and his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liriums did ſometimes diſcover that which he would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd.</p>
            <p>Madam of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> who by all means imaginable did endeavour to find out the Cauſe of his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and of his ſickneſs, perceiv'd
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:66339:99"/>
at laſt that a Jealouſie did torment him; the Love and Eſteem which ſhe had for her Husband, and that which ſhe had for her ſelf, would not permit her to let him live or dye, with ſuch diſadvantageous thoughts of her; She more than once did caſt her ſelf at his feet, telling him, that the ſlight which he had ſhew'd her in depriving her of his Confidence, was unſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable. <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>what do you ſeek to know? Believe that that tenderneſs which I have for you, is the Cauſe of that Secret you ſeek after. You cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand me,</hi> added he ſighing, <hi>and I loſe all the ſatisfaction which I ſhould have in deſerving from you by this laſt Sacrifice, but it is to leave you more at reſt and quiet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe words did ſtill increaſe Madam of <hi>Amboiſe</hi>'s Curioſity, and caus'd her to redouble her intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, inſomuch that at the laſt the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:66339:99"/>
Death of that Count being no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger uncertain, and the Phyſicians having declar'd it to his Wife, the extraordinary Sorrow which ſhe ſhew'd him all the time, and the manner after which ſhe preſs'd him, had the power to tear out of his Boſom, what he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd there till then. <hi>It is belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that your Sickneſs increaſes,</hi> ſaid ſhe, embracing of him, <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs your diſquiet of mind contributes to it. I mention not mine to you, you have diſcover'd to me, againſt your mind, part of that which you had a mind to conceal from me; I know you have unjuſt thoughts of me, you will not give me place of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying my ſelf, and you neglect being ſatisfied of a Perſon that you no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger love; I have, with the fear of loſing you, the aſſurance of having already loſt your Friendſhip and Love: but I have already told you, I go not about to move you by my</hi>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:66339:100"/>
               <hi>Sorrow. I have no other concern in it but your own, complain of me to give your ſelf eaſe, and expreſs your thoughts to put your ſelf more at quiet. Perhaps that you may not find me guilty, if you cauſe me to ſpeak. Well, Madam,</hi> ſaid the Count of <hi>Amboiſe, ſeeing that my ravings have began to betray me, and have troubled you, I muſt inform you of all, and repair thoſe evils that they have done. Read theſe Letters,</hi> ſaid he, preſenting her thoſe that he had receiv'd, <hi>this is it that cauſes my grief, I could not live, and doubt whether I was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd by you or no; I die to leave you to another, that will never love you as I do, but with whom you will be more happy, becauſe that you will love him more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Madam of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> did tremble at the imprudence or malice of thoſe who had ſent the Letter of Advice to her Husband; ſhe did
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:66339:100"/>
not gueſs at them, and she was ſo taken up to ſee him dye for her, that even at that moment the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from <hi>Sanſac</hi> made not the leaſt impreſſion on her mind; Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> who was employ'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Deſign, in examining the motions of her Face, did not perceive her to change colour; <hi>Well, Sir,</hi> ſaid she, <hi>you have thoughts that I could not receive a Letter from</hi> Sanſac, <hi>without entertaining again ſuch Sentiments as would be diſpleaſing to you; I wiſh it had been given me, I had put it into your hands, as I do at this preſent: Ah! if this be true, Madam,</hi> ſaid he with a Tranſport, which ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his days, <hi>muſt I die? What? You can have forgotten</hi> Sanſac, ſaid he, <hi>with Eyes in which Love was not yet extinct? I am aſham'd,</hi> ſaid she, <hi>that I muſt give you new aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of it, but I ſhall be ſatisfied, if they do but put you out of that</hi>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:66339:101"/>
               <hi>condition you are in. No, Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>I die with as much ſatisfaction as regret: but when all is done, your firſt Sentiments have been for</hi> Sanſac, <hi>I am neither unjuſt nor tyrannical, it is much for me to have extinguiſh'd them one moment during my life, they will rekindle after my death; I murmur not at it, oppoſe not my memory to them, you knew that ſo long as I could, I have prefer'd your happineſs to mine, and I ſee with ſome kind of Joy, that you will be perfectly happy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making me unhappy.</hi> No ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner had he ended thoſe words but he ſwooned; The Counteſs of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> was led out of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, notwithſtanding her Tears and her Out-cryes. Madam of <hi>Roye,</hi> who was not much leſs affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted at the condition the Count was in, did however endeavour to comfort her, as much as she could poſſible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:66339:101"/>Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> came out of his Swoon, he order'd that his Wife ſhould be deſir'd not to come into his Chamber any more, that ſhe might ſpare her ſelf the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble which the ſight of him would cauſe her, and becauſe that the ſight of her did make him leave this life with too much unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; he dyed the next day.</p>
            <p>Madam of <hi>Roye</hi> did lead the Counteſs of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> into a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, where ſhe ſtay'd a fortnight, and after that they went into the Country. That Widow's afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did not grow moderate, ſhe thought that ſhe ſhould never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate her ſelf for the Death of her Husband; She knew the full value of that Affection which he had had for her, and how much his Heart and his Merits were above that of other men; She was even in an admiration of him, and ſhe was far from diſtruſting that ſhe
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:66339:102"/>
ſhould ever have any Sentiments of Love for any Body; She even thought that she had never had any ſo ſenſible as for him; She did avoid thinking on <hi>Sanſac</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; She thought she did it through indifferency, but she did inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly think on the Generoſity which her Husband had had of conſenting at his Death, that she ſhould marry him, though she had no deſign of taking any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sanſac</hi> had taken up new Hopes by the Death of Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> but he underſtood that it would be long before he durſt ſee the Widow, and he return'd to <hi>Tours,</hi> when she went into the Country, where she remain'd three months, without receiving any Viſit; mean time her buſineſſes oblig'd her to return to <hi>Paris,</hi> and he return'd alſo at the ſame time ſo ſoon as he heard of it, though he durſt
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:66339:102"/>
not go to her Houſe, he did ſeek after all ſolitary Walks with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to find her there. He was not long without receiving that ſatisfaction, and without cauſing himſelf to be obſerv'd. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> found her ſelf di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd the firſt time that ſhe ſaw him. She thought that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a man that had offended her, might be the cauſe of that trouble, ſhe being then with a Lady of her Relations to whom ſhe would not give any notice of having obſerv'd <hi>Sanſac,</hi> ſhe was oblig'd to go on her way. <hi>Sanſac</hi> did follow her ſtill; and in fine. ſhe went off ſo ſoon as ſhe could poſſible.</p>
            <p>When ſhe was return'd home, ſhe went into her Cloſet, where ſhe could not forbear reading that Letter of the Marqueſſe's, which Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> had given her, and which ſhe had kept; she
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:66339:103"/>
found it full of Paſſion, and she read it over again, after which she was ſeiz'd with profound thoughts, in which she could not diſtinguiſh her own Conceptions.</p>
            <p>Some days after, Monſieur of <hi>Sanſac</hi> having gain'd ſome of her people, to diſcover in what place she would go walk, he was there before her, becauſe she came but late; and when he met her, he ſaluted her after a manner that was full of Sorrow and of Reſpect, which gave her a greater diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance than the firſt time had done, she was got out of the Coach to take the Air; but ſo ſoon as she had ſaluted the Marqueſs, she haſtily got into it again: mean time she had not gone far, but her Coach broke; it was late, she was a pretty way from <hi>Paris,</hi> and she found her ſelf in a great diſorder.</p>
            <p>Monſieur of <hi>Sanſac,</hi> who ſaw at
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:66339:103"/>
diſtance the diſorder which had happen'd to her Equipage, drew near; and not daring to ſpeak to Madam of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> he intreated one of thoſe Women that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied the Counteſs, to offer her, as from him, his Coach to carry her back. Madam of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> could not diſpenſe her ſelf from anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Civility, she returned him thanks, and told him, that ſome of her people were going for ſome body to mend her Coach, and ſent immediately about it: He told her, that he was very unhappy to be refus'd in ſuch an occaſion, where it was almoſt impoſſible not to accept of that which he propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; That Madam of <hi>Amboiſe</hi>'s Coach could not be in a condition to go before night were far advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; That he would wait the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of thoſe which she ſent, and that perhaps neceſſity would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come that repugnancy which she
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:66339:104"/>
had of doing him that Favour. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> did endeavour to anſwer him without rudeneſs, but alſo without promiſing to make uſe of his aſſiſtance; they inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly got into a Converſation, Monſieur of <hi>Sanſac</hi> found out the Art of making it laſt, in ſaying things to Madam of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> which caus'd her to give him ſome An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers. <hi>Thoſe perſons that had been ſent for to mend the Coach, came and ſaid, it was impoſſible to bring it back to</hi> Paris <hi>that day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Madam of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> was in a ſtrange confuſion, night was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, <hi>Sanſac</hi> offer'd to give her his Coach, and to ſtay there till it were return'd; there had been ſome rudeneſs to leave him there alone: mean time she had a great task to reſolve her ſelf to go in the ſame Coach with a man that had lov'd her, and whom she fear'd was not yet quite indifferent to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:66339:104"/>
her. At laſt neceſſity oblig'd her to intreat him to bring her to the firſt Houſes, while she ſhould ſend for a Coach to <hi>Paris.</hi> Thoſe Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes being at a great diſtance, she could not with decency leave him in the fields, and he found too much pleaſure in accompanying Madam of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> to avoid it one moment, ſo that he carried her with two of her Women into the next Town. What Charms for him to find himſelf with her! He durſt not tell her but indifferent things, but he ſpoke to her, did ſee her, and did hope that that Rencon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre would not be without ſome Conſequences; the very Air of Myſtery which did happen acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally in this Adventure, did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford him a great deal of delight.</p>
            <p>The ſame Reaſons that created that Lover's Joy, did alarm Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle <hi>Amboiſe</hi>'s Severity, she was ſo agitated with different
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:66339:105"/>
thoughts, that she ſaid nothing but in diſorder. The Marqueſs, who perceiv'd it, did not draw any ill Omen from it, neither durſt he ask her the permiſſion of ſeeing her any longer, after he had ſet her where she deſired to be, but he hover'd about that place, till she was gone from thence.</p>
            <p>The next day he writ to her to ask an hours Audience before he went to <hi>Chartres,</hi> where the King was ſending him with a Reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of four thouſand men, who were got into the City, which the Huguenots had beſieg'd.</p>
            <p>That Counteſs was puzled about the Conduct that she ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in that occaſion; she had been buſied all the night with the thoughts of the Rencontre which she had made, <hi>Sanſac</hi> had appear'd more amorous than ever, but she durſt not find him as lovely; mean time he was almoſt juſtified in her
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:66339:105"/>
mind, in regard of Madam of <hi>Tournon,</hi> by his Letter, which ſhe had read divers times over. Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> far from fearing that ſhe ſhould marry him, had in ſome manner enjoyned her to it at his death, yet ſhe thought that that was not ſufficient to invite her to marry him; but that ſhe might ſee him without ſcruple, ſhe was to ſpeak to him, and to learn who it was had ſent to Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> thoſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which had caus'd ſo much diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. In fine, ſhe was to inform <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſac</hi> of the reſolution that ſhe had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of remaining a Widow; in thoſe thoughts ſhe let him know that he might ſee her.</p>
            <p>With what Joy did he go to her Houſe, and found himſelf at liberty to ſpeak to her of his Paſſion; he thought that her Beauty was yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd, her Mourning and the Emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which appear'd on her Face, did add a thouſand Charms. He caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at her Feet, without pronouncing one ſingle word, and even without thinking what he did.</p>
            <p>Madam of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> did oblige him to riſe, with ſuch a ſerious Look, as
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:66339:106"/>
did kill him with fear, he took a ſeat as ſhe had ordered him to do, and he was a long time without daring to life up his Eyes towards her; that Reſpect did move her more than the Tranſport of his Love had done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have had the boldneſs, Madam,</hi> ſaid he ſcarce looking on her, <hi>to ask to ſee you, but I am ſufficiently puniſh'd for it, and your Air denounces me thoſe Evils, which I had avoided to prevent.</hi> Madam of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> made him no Anſwer. <hi>You ſay nothing to me, Madam?</hi> added he, <hi>ſpeak, reduce me to deſpair, thoſe harſh things that you will ſay to me, will be leſs cruel than your ſilence. I ſhall ſpeak to you,</hi> anſwer'd ſhe, <hi>I had not let you come, if I had not had a great deal to ſay, and I am only troubled where to begin. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that I ought not to rejoyce, Madam,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>at what you have to ſay to me; it is eaſie for me to foreſee, that it will not prove advantageous to me, and you take off much of the Favour you do me, which had been too great, had you had nothing to do but to hear me. I ſhall not make any difficulty to confeſs to you,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>that I have ſeen that Letter you writ to me on the account of my Marriage, and</hi>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:66339:106"/>
               <hi>which was ſent to Monſieur of</hi> Amboiſe, <hi>I muſt know of you to whom you had given it, and how ſo ill and unfortunate a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for me, through the death of Monſieur of</hi> Amboiſe, <hi>was carried.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sanſac</hi> related to her, that it being impoſſible for him to return to <hi>Paris,</hi> becauſe there was ſome fear of an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt by the Huguenots upon <hi>Tours;</hi> he had truſted his Siſter with the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who promis'd to put it into her own hands; that Madmoiſelle of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſac</hi> being as ignorant as he was, that they were already married, thought that the beſt way was to prevent it, by ſending thoſe Letters to Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe: But, Madam,</hi> added he, <hi>I find that their ill ſucceſs is imputed to me, and that though my Letter had been ſeen but to your ſelf, I ought not to have expected any thing but your anger from it. No doubt of that,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>ſeeing that I was Monſieur of</hi> Amboiſe's <hi>Wife; but I had reaſon to believe that Madam of</hi> Tournon <hi>would have comforted you of my Marriage, or at leaſt that it had not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted you ſo much. Madam of</hi> Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, cryed he, <hi>Is it poſſible, Madam, that you can think ſhe could conſolate me</hi>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:66339:107"/>
               <hi>one moment for your loſs?</hi> Madam of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> could not forbear ſpeaking to him of the deference which he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to that Counteſs the Maſquerading day; but he did proteſt to her with ſo much integrity and ingenuity, that he thought he had danced with her, and of the Converſation which he alſo thought he had had with her, on the account of <hi>Sancerre,</hi> confounding them both for a while; at laſt they unra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd it, and found that Madam of <hi>Tournon</hi> had play'd them both. Truth did manifeſt it ſelf to them, while they diſcours'd it; they found that they were both innocent; a pleaſing Joy which they had not felt of a long time, took again poſſeſſion of their Hearts.</p>
            <p>When they had no more Complaints to make, they lookt on one another a while. <hi>But, Madam,</hi> reply'd the Marqueſs of <hi>Sanſac, what avails it to me, that you have not lov'd</hi> Sancerre, <hi>if I am grown indifferent to you? You ought, at leaſt, to be ſo to me,</hi> reply'd Madam of <hi>Amboiſe; I have married an Husband, the moſt worthy to be belov'd that ever was, this laſt words deſerv'd that I ſhould ever be prepoſſeſs'd by him.</hi>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:66339:107"/>
               <hi>I was reſolv'd to make it a Secret to you, but I find my ſelf engag'd to tell it you, to mark to you the better the obligation I have to love him ever.</hi> She gave him an account of the Converſation that Monſieur of <hi>Amboiſe</hi> had had with her on that ſubject, ſoftning a little thoſe Terms which might flatter him too much, yet that Lover remain'd charm'd with that confidence that ſhe had ſhew'd him. <hi>Ah! Madam,</hi> ſaid he, caſting himſelf once more at her feet, <hi>perform the laſt Will of Monſieur of</hi> Amboiſe; <hi>I have merited to ſucceed him, ſeeing that I am choſen by him ſo to do, your indifferency only can render me unworthy of it. But,</hi> added he, <hi>why ſhould I be indifferent to you? I have not ceas'd one moment from being the moſt amorous of all men; I am autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris'd to tell you ſo much, and you ought to make no ſcruples, but of not loving me. I perceive that I have told you too much,</hi> ſaid ſhe bluſhing, and obliging him to riſe with more mildneſs than the firſt time, <hi>it is no longer time to diſſemble with you,</hi> added ſhe, <hi>know that my inclination is not quite extinct. That <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ad I but ſooner learnt your innocence.</hi>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:66339:108"/>
               <hi>I had not been Monſieur of</hi> Amboiſe's <hi>Priſe, he had not died, and nothing had prevented me from being yours; but ſince I have married him, I owe him one Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for all thoſe that he has made me, for this reaſon I have fram'd the deſign of remaining a Widow; and ſhould I have ſo much weakneſs as not to perform it, I ſhould not be happy in marrying you: What friendſhip ſoever I ſhould have for you, my reflexions would prevent me from the enjoyment of yours, and peradventure would deprive me of mine alſo at laſt. Ah! Madam,</hi> ſaid he, with a Deſpair in his Soul, <hi>I find you have never lov'd me. I wiſh it were true,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him ſighing. <hi>'Las! Madam,</hi> anſwer'd he, <hi>if it is ſo, why tell you me ſuch cruel things? and why would you have me to renounce you? I cannot do it, it is eaſier for me to die<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>you cannot make an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to leave me to my ſelf, as Monſieur of</hi> Amboiſe <hi>has done to leave me to you. No<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Madam,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>propoſe to me no Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, I have too much Love, only to think of loſing you; and if you deprive me of hope thoſe dangers in which I am going to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, and where I ſhall not manage my ſelf will deliver you from a Lover who is to</hi>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:66339:108"/>
               <hi>paſſionate to overcome his Sentiments, or to conceal them. Anſwer me once more, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, my life and death are in your hands. What do you tell me,</hi> ſaid Madam of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boiſe,</hi> with Eyes ſwell'd with Tears, <hi>Why will you have me to determinate? at leaſt leave me unreſolv'd, ſeeing you have already ſhaken my reſolution. Sanſac</hi> would have engag'd her to have given him her poſitive Word to marry him, but ſhe fix'd to what ſhe had ſaid. He was oblig'd to take leave of her, and he went to <hi>Chartres</hi> with the four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men which he was to conduct there.</p>
            <p>When he was gone, Madam of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boiſe</hi> did perceive how far ſhe had gone already; that the Suſpicions which <hi>Sanſac</hi> had diſpers'd, were become in ſome manner meritorious towards her, and that ſhe had found a great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of praiſing him, in having not had as great an occaſion of complaining of him; ſhe thought that ſhe had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid her ſelf too eaſily and too ſoon; and that when he ſhould make any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions on that Conduct, he would have leſs eſteem for her than Love; that thought did vex her, ſhe told her
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:66339:109"/>
ſelf, that ſuch an Husband as ſhe had had, did merit a Wife with high Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, and ſtedfaſtneſs; that in fine, the pleaſure of thinking on him, and of being contented with her ſelf, ought for ever to poſſeſs her.</p>
            <p>But ſoon after ſhe made other gueſs Reflexions, Monſieur of <hi>Sanſac</hi> was kill'd before <hi>Charters,</hi> in ſallying forth on the Huguenots; and ſhe had ſo cruel a Sorrow for it, that ſhe gueſs'd it had been impoſſible for her to have merited long his eſteem at the coſt of that tenderneſs which ſhe had for him; ſhe return'd into the Country, where ſhe paſs'd the reſt of her days, fill'd with thoſe divers afflictions, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out daring ever to unravel them, for fear of knowing which was ſtrongeſt.</p>
