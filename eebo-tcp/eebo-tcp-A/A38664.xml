            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Earle of Essex.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen and fellow Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
which are at this
time assembled for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of his majestie, and
the maintenance of the
true protestant Religion under my
command, I shall desire you to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
what I that am your Generall shall
by my Honour promise to performe to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward
you, and what I shall be forced to
expect that you should performe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
me.</p>
            <p>I do promise in the sight of Almighty
God, that I shall undertake nothing,
<pb facs="tcp:96598:3"/>
but what shall tend to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the true protestant Religion,
the securing of his Majesties Royall
Person, the maintenance of the just pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
of Parliament, and the liberty
and property of the Subject, neither
will I ingage any of you into any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
but (though for many reasons I
might forbeare) I will in my owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
runne an equall hazard with you,
and either bring you off with Honour,
or (if God have so decreed) fall with
you, and willingly become a sacrafice
for the preservation of my Country.</p>
            <p>Likewise I doe promise that my eare
shall be open to heare the complaint
of the poorest of my Souldiers, though
against the chiefest of my Officers, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall his greatnesse (if justly tax'd)
gaine any priviledge, but I shall be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb facs="tcp:96598:3"/>
to execute Justice against all from
the greatest to the least.</p>
            <p>Your pay shall be constantly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to your Commanders, and if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault
be made by any Officer, give me
timely notice, and you shall find speedy
redresse.</p>
            <p>This being performed on my part,
I shall now declare what is your duty
toward me, which I must likewise ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to be carefully performed by you.</p>
            <p>1. I shall desire All and every Officer
to endeavour by love and affable carriage
to command his Souldiers, since what is
done for feare, is done unwillingly, and
what is unwillingly attempted can never
prosper.</p>
            <p>Likewise tis my request that you be very
carefull in the excercising of your men, and
bring them to use their Armes readily and
expertly, and not to bussy them in practiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:96598:4"/>
the cerimonious formes of <hi>Military</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline,
onely let them be well instructed in
the necessary rudiments of Warre, that they
may know to fall on with discretion, and
retreate with care, how to maintaine their
Order, and make good their ground.</p>
            <p>Also I doe expect that all those which vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
ingaged themselves in this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
should answer my expectation in the
performance of these ensuing Artickles.</p>
            <p>1. That you willingly and cheerefully o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
such as (by your owne election) you have
made Commanders over you.</p>
            <p>2. That you take speciall care to keepe
your Armes at all times fit for Service, that
upon all occasions you may be ready when
the signall shall be given by the sound of
Drumme or Trumpet to repaire to your
Colours, and so to march upon any Service
where, and when occasion shall require.</p>
            <p>3. That you beare your selves like Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
<pb facs="tcp:96598:4"/>
without doing any spoile to the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of the Country, so doing you shall
gaine love and friendship, where otherwise
you will be hated, and complained off, and
I that should protect you, shall be forced to
punish you according to the severity of Law</p>
            <p>4. That you accept and rest satisfied with
such quarters as shall fall to your Lot, or
be appointed you by your quartermaster.</p>
            <p>5. That you shall (if appointed for Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
or <hi>Per-dues)</hi> faithfully discharge
that duty, for upon faile heereof, you are
sure to undergo a very severe censure.</p>
            <p>6. You shall forbeare to prophane the
<hi>Saboth,</hi> either by being drunke, or by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
games for whosoever shall be found
faulty must not expect to passe unpunished.</p>
            <p>7. Whosoever shall be knowne to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
the feeding of his Horse with necessary
Provender, to the end that his Horse be
disabled or unfit for Service, the party for
<pb facs="tcp:96598:5"/>
the party for the said default, shall suffer a
month's imprisonment, and afterward be
cashiered as unworthy the name of a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier.</p>
            <p>8. That no Trooper or other of our sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
shall suffer his <hi>Paddee</hi> to feed his
Horse in the Corne, or to steale mens hay,
but shall pay every man for <hi>Hay</hi> 6. d. day
and night, and for <hi>Oats</hi> 2. s. the Bushell.</p>
            <p>Lastly, that you avoid cruelty; for it is
my desire rather to save the life of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands,
then to kill one, so that it may be
done without prejudice.</p>
            <p>These things faithfully performed, and
the justice of our cause truely considered
let us advance with a religions courage,
and willingly adventure our lives in the
defence of the King and Parliament.</p>
