            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT has been for many hundreds of years the main Scope and Aim of the Clergy in moſt Opinions, to graſp into their Clutches the exerciſe of Temporal Juriſdiction; &amp; as in former times, ſo now of late our Church of <hi>England</hi> Men, have not been the leaſt ambitious of that Authority: 'Tis true, the Clergy of <hi>England</hi> could never fix ſuch Juriſdiction in themſelves: but what they could not perform by their Spiritual Authority, they brought to paſs by the aſſiſtance of the Civil Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. They found that the Scripture, had not given them the leaſt title to lord it over the Conſciences of Men in matters of Religion, nor had left them any wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons to combat Diſſenters in Opinion, nay even Error it ſelf, onely Chriſtian Admonition; and at laſt, when that would not prevail, Publick Separation from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with ſuch as obſtinately perſiſted in defyance of the Truth. For this reaſon they never ceaſed to Amuſe and Alarm the Civil Magiſtrate with continual Suſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Fears, to render him jealous of all other Men that were not conformable to their Humours and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. A paſſionate conceit of their own Perfection
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93327:3"/>
above others, which no man of common ſence can be reconciled to, and a convincing argument that thoſe Perſons muſt have but little or no Conſcience them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who with ſo much Vigor and Obſtinacy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to uphold a Civil Perſecution ſo directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to all the dictates of Scripture, Reaſon, and Conſcience.</p>
            <p>As for Scripture, the Authority of it is ſo evident to the contrary that nothing can be more, where it inſtructs the Servants of God, to <hi>be gentle to all men,</hi> ſorbids Chriſtians to <hi>Judge one another,</hi> and tells us, that every man is <hi>to ſtand or fall to his own Maſter; that one man e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steems one day above another, and another eſteems all days alike;</hi> yet <hi>happy is he who condemns not himſelfe in that which he allows:</hi> That is to ſay, whoſe Conſcience does not inwardly accuſe his outward profeſſion: The ſame great and zealous Preacher of the Goſpel, in the caſe of the unbelieving Wiſe and Husband gives ſuch a mild and condeſcending anſwer, as if he had taken his Pen from a Doves wing; Let neither Her nor Him that unbelieves depart, if pleaſed to ſtay; for that God had called us to peace; adding withal, that as <hi>God has called every one, ſo let him walk;</hi> and ſo he ordained <hi>to all the Churches:</hi> Certainly there could be nothing more divinely uttered to oblige the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, in Charity and Meekneſs to forbear one another, then ſuch an expreſs Injunction of ſo authentick an Apoſtle, to live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably with an Infidel. Nay, writing to the Chriſtians, he abſolutely denyes that even the Apoſtles themſelves, have any Soveraignty over the Conſcience, but only commiſſions to aid and aſſiſt their Conſciences: <hi>Not</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that we have dominion over your Faith, but are helpers of your Joy:</hi> Altogether conformable to that Doctrine of Meekneſs wherein <hi>Chriſt</hi> inſtructs his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, not to aſpire to the Title of <hi>Rabbi,</hi> or Maſter, in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93327:3"/>
Spiritual Affairs: beſides that we are admoniſhed to let the Tares grow among the Wheat, till the time of Harveſt.</p>
            <p>Nor is it for any man to ſuggeſt, that this mild and moderate Temper was only intended for thoſe Primitive Times, when the Chriſtians were liable to Perſecution without any Temporal Power to defend themſelves: For let the choiceſt Champions but grant that thoſe were the beſt and pureſt times, and then it will behove them to ſhew a Dormant VVar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the Scripture, by which <hi>Christ</hi> ever gave Commiſſion to his Diſciples to cut the Throats of all Diſſenters, or to deſpoil them of their Eſtates, and ſend them to perpetual Baniſhment, and they have done their work: But if they can bring no ſuch authority, they muſt acknowledge that Lording o'er the Conſcience is an unwarrantable piece of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny over the Rights and Liberties of a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>True it is, that the Succeſſors of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> were taught by their Ecleſiaſticks, that there were two Duties required from them; one as Chriſtians, the other as Soveraigns: that as Chriſtians, they were bound to obey divine Precepts, as every private man is bound to do; but as Princes, to make good Laws, and keep their Subjects ſteady in the practice of Piety, Honeſty and Juſtice, chaſtizing the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors of his ſacred Laws, eſpeaclally the Deaca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>logue. And becauſe they who tranſgreſſed againſt the firſt Table, which relates to divine worſhip, were worſe then they who tranſgreſſed againſt the Second, which relates only to Juſtice between Man and Man, therefore Princes were oblig'd to puniſh Blaſphemy, Perjury, and Hereſy, more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely then Murder or Theft.</p>
            <p>As for Blaſphemy and Perjury, there was reaſon
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93327:4"/>
ſufficient why they ſhould be puniſhed by civil Penalties, For Blaſphemers and Perjured Perſons can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thought to be men of Conſcience, nor are they that take that Liberty to be endured, for that Blaſphemy and Perjury are criminal in all Religions, and differing opinions whatever, as being contrary to good manners, and contaminations of civil Society; but it does not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from hence, that every man muſt be puniſhed as a <hi>Heretick,</hi> who differs in his judgement from the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Certainly it muſt be firſt agreed upon, what a <hi>Heretick</hi> is, and who is that <hi>Heretick,</hi> and which is that Law that reaches his offence, before they can puniſh him by any Law. Now thoſe things that make a <hi>Heretick,</hi> are Errors in Fundamentals or about Fundamentals, Conviction and Contumacy; And they are <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who obſtinately and againſt the moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent light of Truth, defend ſome doctrine directly or of neceſſary conſequence tearing up the foundations of Chriſtian Faith. The Church of <hi>England</hi> therefore ſhould have made it out, that the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> and <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> were <hi>Hereticks</hi> of this ſort, Convicted and Contumaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and then all they could do, was to put them under Excommunication, not to torment their Perſons and Eſtates, with Mulcts, Impriſonments, Fines, and Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, which how diſſonant it is from the Golden Rule of <hi>God</hi> Himſelf, ſtill preferring <hi>Mercy</hi> above Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, is evidently apparent. The character of <hi>Menelaus</hi> in the ſecond of <hi>Maccabees</hi> is, that he was <hi>unworthy of the Preiſthood,</hi> as one that had <hi>the Fury of a cruel Tyrant, and the Rage of a ſavage Beaſt.</hi> Conformable to which, was that of <hi>Cicero,</hi> quoted by <hi>Lactantius, It is the moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable thing in the world,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>to carry a ſavage and cruel diſpoſition under the ſhape of a man.</hi> It is ſaid that <hi>Diana</hi> of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> had a Temple and an Altar near the entrance into the lake <hi>Meotis,</hi> upon which it,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93327:4"/>
was the cuſtom of the <hi>Heathens</hi> to Sacrifice the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of living Men; a Cruelty little differing from the ſeverity of thoſe People that ſeem to make their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt their <hi>Scythian Diana,</hi> and living Men the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to their Ambition, and the ſupport of their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Grandeur. Yet this muſt be the main deſign of thoſe that ſtudy thus the deſtruction of all other Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals but themſelves within the Verge of their Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; which as it is a great Argument of a Spiritual Arbitrary Government, ſo is it at the ſame time a ſign of no leſs Preſumption for a particular number of Men, encloſed within the narrow Circle of Epiſcopacy, compar'd with thoſe vaſt multitudes of <hi>Diſſenters</hi> and <hi>Roman-Catholicks,</hi> that under various names of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction invented by their Adverſaries, ſpread themſelves over the fourth part of the World, to arrogate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be the only Flock of Chriſt; and that they are the only Paſtors who have power to drive men to Heaven; for this is to diſclaim the Popes Supremacy, and uſurp it to themſelves; to Preach down one An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, and ſet up ſix and twenty: For if Meekneſs, Mildneſs, Unity, Peace, and Concord, are the Vertues that embelliſh Chriſtian Juriſdiction; Cruelty, Rigor, Perſecution and Violence, muſt be the marks of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Tyranny.</p>
            <p>They therefore that ſo vehemently Perſecute the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, becauſe they either doubt or happily err in ſome particulars that will admit of Ambiguity, and which it may be, have been otherwiſe underſtood in former Ages, are moſt unjuſt. For we find that the Antient <hi>Jews</hi> did never Puniſh the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> tho they denied the Doctrine of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. For that tho it were moſt true, yet then it was but only glanced at in their Law, and not taught at all, but covertly under Types and Figures. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93327:5"/>
the Errors to be ſuch, as among equal Judges might be eaſily confuted, both by the Authority of the Scriptures, and the common Conſent of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; Nevertheleſs the great ſtrength of an over-grown Opinion is to be conſidered, and how the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of Men to defend their own Sects, diminiſhes the ſtrength and liberty of their Judgments. A Man will ſooner part with any thing than his Opinion: An Opinion, ſays <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> that has taken deep root through Cuſtome, is hardly to be removed: for that there is nothing that we alter with more unwillingneſs then our Cuſtomes in Religion. But whether this different Opinion be an Error, and how it is to be Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, he only can without danger judge, who is the Eternal Judge, who alone knows the true meaſures of Knowledge and the proportion of Faith. Let them Rage againſt you, ſays St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> concerning the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees,</hi> who can preſume to be without Errors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for my part I neither can nor dare, for I ought to bear with you as others did formerly with me, and to treat you with as much Patience, Meekneſs, and Gentleneſs, as they did me, when I was blindly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away with your Errors. <hi>Religionis non eſt Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem cogere,</hi> ſays <hi>Tertullian;</hi> And <hi>Athanaſius</hi> alſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blames the <hi>Arrians,</hi> becauſe they were the firſt that call'd in the Civil Power to their Aſſiſtance againſt their Antagoniſts, and that endeavoured by Force, Stripes, and Impriſonments, to draw ſuch to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whom they could not win by the ſtrength of their Arguments. <hi>Gregory,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> writing to the Biſhop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> ſaid that it was a new and unheard of manner of Preaching, to enforce Faith by Stripes and Puniſhments. Hiſtory alſo affords us the Examples of ſeveral <hi>French</hi> Biſhops, who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the judgment of the Church for calling in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93327:5"/>
the Civil Power againſt the <hi>Priſcillianists;</hi> and of a whole Council in the Eaſt that was Condemned for conſenting to the Burning of <hi>Bogomilus.</hi> Conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ſayings of <hi>Plato,</hi> The Puniſhment of him that Errs, is to be <hi>Inſtructed.</hi> And of <hi>Seneca,</hi> That no wiſe man ever hated thoſe that Erred; for if ſo, he muſt neceſſarily ſometimes hate himſelf: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Emperour <hi>Valentinian</hi> is highly commended, becauſe he never Perſecuted any man for his Religion, nor ever commanded this or that to be Adored; nor forced his Subjects to Embrace his own manner of Worſhip.</p>
            <p>Infinite are the ſayings of the Primitive Fathers and Men of Learning, their Succeſſors, who have all along condemned the forcing of Conſcience, or compelling Men to do a thing which is contrary to their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or to abſtain from ſuch Exerciſes as they in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience eſteem neceſſary and profitable for their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: all centring in the utter deteſtation of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Violence and Impoſition in matters of Religion. A Maxim which not all the Uſurpations of Eccleſiaſtical Perſons have bin able to corrupt. And therefore it was the ſaying of <hi>Montluc,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholic, and Biſhop of <hi>Valence,</hi> That the Rigors of Torments was never to be practized towards People who had no other Crime but only a Perſwaſion which they thought to be good and pious. <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> ſpeaking of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Church, It is her Duty, <hi>ſays he,</hi> to correct Sinners, not with the Sword, not with Penal-Laws or Fines, not with Impriſonment or Exilement, but after her own Method, by the Efficacy and Power of the Word.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Second, Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> That tho he perſever'd to his death a <hi>Roman Catholic,</hi> yet he was never the leſs diſeſteemed by the

               <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> for that in matters of Religion he obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an exact Moderation between both Parties, and never ceas'd till he had obtain'd the uſe of the Cup in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> for thoſe of his Subjects that deſir'd it. The ſame Emperour alſo gave this Advice to <hi>Henry</hi> the Third of <hi>France,</hi> then returning out of <hi>Poland,</hi> to quiet all diſturbances in his Kingdom at his firſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into it; according to the Example of his Father <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who after he had long toyl'd and labour'd in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the V. to appeaſe the troubles in <hi>Germany,</hi> and ſettle the differences about <hi>Religion,</hi> when he found the Minds of the People more provok'd, then any remedy obtain'd by force and violence, with the Conſent and Applauſe of all the Orders of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, made thoſe favourable Conceſſions, which when nothing alſo would do, reſtor'd Tranquilitie to the Empire.</p>
            <p>More Remarkable was that ſaying of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third of <hi>France</hi> Himſelf, upon his Death-Bed, after he had received his Deaths wound from <hi>Clement</hi> the Monk, Nor let the cauſe of Religion deter ye: This Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror long poſſeſs'd me, and drew me into inextricable Miſtakes. The pretence of <hi>Religion</hi> hurried us into Faction. Leave that to the judgment of the <hi>Orders</hi> of the Kingdom, and keep this in your Minds as a fix'd and conſtant Maxime, That <hi>Religion,</hi> which is inſpir'd into the Minds of Men by God, cannot be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Men. Nay, <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth, the none of the beſt of Popes, yet being Sollicited by the <hi>French</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador for the uſe of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> in both kinds, had ſo much kindneſs for Toleration, that he gave for anſwer to the Embaſſador, That he had always thought the uſe of the Sacrament in both kinds, and liberty for the Prieſt-hood to Marry, were things indifferent, and as depending rather upon the Decrees of the Fathers,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93327:6"/>
then upon Divine Authority, might be altered accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the conſtitutions of Times, and alteration of Cuſtomes.</p>
            <p>And in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> ſeveral of the wiſeſt and chiefeſt of the Prelates ſtiffly argu'd againſt the Prohibition of the Uſe of the Cup, affirming thoſe to be void of Chriſtian Charity, who ſtood ſo ſtrictly and ſo nicely upon a particular Ceremony, the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of which might prevent the Effuſion of much Blood, and recover into the Boſom of the Church ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that were fallen from Her.</p>
            <p>And thus what Scripture and Humane Authority juſtify, Common Reaſon is no leſs ready to uphold. For firſt, If the word of <hi>God</hi> be the ſole Rule of <hi>Faith,</hi> and no Humane Authority be ſo highly impowr'd as to bind up our Aſſents to whatever Interpretations ſhall be propos'd, then of neceſſity it follows that every Chriſtian indifferently has an equal Intereſt in the will of the Creator, ſo that no particular Perſon has a right to impoſe a force upon the judgment of his Brother. Thus one holds the Baptizing of Infants to be neceſſary; another deems it lawful; a third denies both theſe Opinions, yet admitting that it may, but that there is no neceſſity it ſhould be done; therefore they conferr Texts, and examine the Original; yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all diligence uſed, they ſtill are but where they were. Now what reaſon can there be to adviſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution for ſuch a difference as this?</p>
            <p>Beſides, There are ſeveral Diſputes upon various Points of Chriſtianity, that cannot be cleard to any man by Arguments meerly natural, as being matters of Fact, ſuch are the Miracles and Reſurrection of Chriſt, the Real Preſence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the belief of which therefore, there is a need of <hi>Faith,</hi> which is the Gift of Grace, and not of Nature: which being ſo, and ſeeing more-over
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93327:7"/>
that it is not within the power of Man to give a reaſon why ſome Men believe, and others are of a contrary Opinion; it cannot fall under the Imagination of Man, that either the defect or ſurpluſage of belief, which may perhaps glide into Superſtition, which of the two ſo'ere be the cauſe of the difference, ſhould be ſubject to the Puniſhment of Human Laws; for tho both have the ſame outward helps and means to inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet the potent cauſe is in the will of God, <hi>who will have Mercy upon whom he will have Mercy, and whom he will he hardens.</hi> And therefore for this cauſe it was that <hi>Tertullian</hi> avers that the New Law of the Goſpel does not call for the Sword to revenge the Injuries done it. And <hi>Siſibutus</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> was juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tax'd for compelling the <hi>Jews</hi> to Chriſtianity by the coercive power of the Sword, when he ought to have won them to the <hi>Faith</hi> by meek and gentle Perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>In the next place this violent and rigorous Proceeding and tyrannizing over the Conſciences of Men, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the purpoſe of God in the Order of the Creation, who made and ordain'd all Man-kind free from Bondage, and never advanc'd him over all the Works of his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, to be a contemptible Slave to the Will of his fellow Creature, even in things Temporal; much leſs in matters Spiritual and relating to Eternity. So that this ſame actual Violence of Impoſing by force in matters of <hi>Faith, Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi> to God, of one Man upon another, or of ſome Perſons over all, is an Act of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Preſumption imaginable, that goes about to ſubdue to Bondage and Slavery, thoſe that are Created by God to equal Priviledges and Immunities with themſelves; ſubjecting them by Oppreſſion, not to the Divine Will of the Creator, but to the Will, Ambition and Intereſt of Mortal Creatures, no leſs fraile and ſubject to Error
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93327:7"/>
then they over whom they affect illegal Dominion. A thing which is quite contrary to the moſt pure and perfect order of the Creation, which was altogether bleſſed. From which whatever is degenerated by Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, or has deviated by Temptation from that pure and regular Order, either in things Temporal or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, muſt be included within the curſe of Sin, and be lookt upon as an oppoſing the Creator himſelf. And of this nature, is Compulſion exerciſed in Spiritual mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; as being the higheſt product of degenerate Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, and the grandeſt ſwerving imaginable from the chief deſign of the Creation. For without all queſtion, the Creator himſelf reſerved and retained in his own power alone, the priviledge of Supremacy over the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man, in all matters touching Immortality, that he might be the only Lord in that caſe, to give Spiritual Laws, and to command the Souls and hearts of men, in reference to his own Worſhip, and that Obedience which is due to himſelf; ſo that of neceſſity it muſt be a Uſurpation of the Creators rightful Dominion, a rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing Him of his Dignity and Prerogative, an act of Violence againſt his Soveraignty, and a bold intrud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into his proper Right, for any Perſons to aſſume to themſelves Dominion and Authority over others, by Commanding and Impoſing in Spiritual matters upon their Conſciences, in the Worſhip and Service of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Add to this that Force is Puniſhment, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unjuſt, unleſs the offence be voluntary: but he that believes according to the evidence of his own Reaſon, is neceſſitated to that Belief, and to compel him againſt it, were to compel him to renounce the moſt eſſential part of man, his reaſon: And that ſame injunction would be altogether vain, <hi>To hold faſt that which w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93327:8"/>
Election, we muſt be whipt out of our Conſciences by Penalties. 'Tis but odly done to Preach a company of poor Souls into juſt ſo much Liberty of Scripture as may ſuffice to beget their torture, and not permit them to reſt where they find their ſatisfaction: Either utterly prohibit the ſearch, or let them enjoy the benefit of it. To believe what appears untrue, is ſomewhat impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but to profeſs what we believe untrue, is abſolutely damnable.</p>
            <p>Nor is it one of the leaſt arguments againſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of Conſcience, that it breaks the bands of civil Society, and annihilates all manner of Love, Unity, Fellowſhip, and Concord among men. Neighbours are at enmity among Neighbours, Brethren with Brethren, and Families are divided among themſelves. Princes and their Subjects, Rulers and their People are at diſcord and debates, that many times turns to abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Diſobedience and Rebellion; while the one labours to Impoſe, the other to keep off the Oppreſſion. Men, ſays <hi>Zenophon,</hi> reſiſt none with greater animoſity, then thoſe that affect to Tyrannize over their bodies; more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſuch as ſeek to eſtabliſh an illegal Dominion over their minds and Conſciences. They contend <hi>pro Aris</hi> in the firſt place, and <hi>pro Focis</hi> afterwards; thereby preferring the Liberty of their Conſciences, before the ſecurity of their Eſtates; which they rather chooſe to abandon, then to be deprived of their Spiritual Freedom. And this is that which cauſes, and has cauſed ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands in this Nation to forſake their native Soyle, their Friends &amp; Relations, to the decay of civil fellowſhip and Commerce, and out of a deteſtable Antipathy to their Oppreſſors, to ſeek for forraign Protection, under which to enjoy the more noble and agreeable pleaſure of enjoying the free exerciſe of their Sentiments in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:93327:8"/>
Again, <hi>Grotius</hi> tells us, That there never was any Sect that could diſcern all Truth, nor any but what held ſomething that is True; as then they are to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured for what they hold of Truth, ſo are they not to be puniſhed for what they maintain of miſtaken Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leif; ſince all men are free by nature to believe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they think to be Good and Honeſt. We cannot love <hi>God</hi> too much. Now ſuppoſing that the Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> may eſteem the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> over zealous in ſome points of Worſhip which may be thought too Superſtitious, what then? For Superſtition does not ſin in worſhiping <hi>God</hi> too much, but in worſhiping him erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly; in point of which Error and conſequent non-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance with the Epiſcopal Tenents of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> theſe failings of theirs, are not to be ſqueez'd out of their Bones and Purſes, but to be reform'd by gentle Inſtructions and Convincement, according to the true duty of Biſhops to Inſtruct, Perſwade, Exhort and Reprove, but not to Command or Compel.</p>
            <p>To what has been ſaid, may be added the vanity of the Undertaking, it having been all along evinc'd by the ſtories of all ages, that forcing of Conſcience, and Perſecution for Religions ſake, have not only become fruſtrate, but increaſed the number of thoſe Sects and Diviſions of which they ſought the extirpation, and that the Sword, Exile, Fagot, Impriſonment, and heavy Fines, rather provoak then cure the obſtinacy of relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctant Minds. For the conformation of which, we find from the beginning and for a long time the Chriſtian Rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion induſtriouſly oppoſed by the moſt Potent Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, then ruling in the World, and Extirpation of it no leſs cruelly labour'd by the fury of <hi>Ten Perſecutions;</hi> yet could not all that vaſt effuſion of Blood put a ſtop to its progreſs, nor prevent its growing to ſuch a Head, as at length to turn Tyrannick Heatheniſm with all her

fantaſtick Abominations, and falſe Divinities quite out of the World. The ſame may be ſaid of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> againſt whom the Fryers preached, the Inquiſitors Plotted, the Princes made War, while the Pope accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their Perſons, and interdicted their Lands, yet for all the Pope could do, they could not be ſuppreſt. And of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> ſays <hi>Thuanus,</hi> tho they were toſſ'd from Poſt to Pillar, yet there were ever ſome found, who ſtill in their ſeveral courſes renewed their Doctrine, buryed as it were for a ſeaſon. For Sects and Opinions are like Books, which the more they are ſuppreſſed, the more they are ſought after and careſs'd: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Tacitus,</hi> ſpeaking of the Annalls of <hi>Cremutius Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> condemn'd by the Senate to be burnt, for advancing the Praiſes of <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius,</hi> relates that ſome indeed were burnt by the <hi>Edils,</hi> but more were preſerv'd, and, afterwards publiſhed. An argument (ſays he) ſufficient that the vanity and madneſs of thoſe men, is to be derid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who imagin by preſent Power to ſtifle the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances of future Ages. And the Author of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> ſpeaking of the prohibition of Heretical Books, obſerves that it did more harm then good, while the Books being ſought for as ſuch, did but ſerve to raiſe and inſtill new doubts and ſcruples in the minds of the Readers. The ſame is to be ſaid of the Perſecutions of Men in their Bodies and Goods; for others obſerving the extream Patience and Conſtancy of ſo many People ſuffering for their particular Opinions in matters of Religion, become curious to underſtand what that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſhould be that inſpires men with ſo much reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſuffer the worſt of Miſeries, rather then abandon the Profeſſion of it, which is the reaſon that Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors according to the Opinion of <hi>Strada,</hi> though they are not concerned in tormenting, yet they dread the Triumphs of the Tormented at their Executions, for
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93327:9"/>
that it has been frequently known that one Martyr <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>From hence we may proceed to ſhew the dreadful Effects and Miſchiefs that have attended the Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of tender Conſciences in matters of Religion, which have generally prov'd moſt fatal, and in the end re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounded to the greateſt loſs of the Perſecutors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for of all the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours that exerciz'd thoſe horrid Cruelties upon the Chriſtians under their ſubjection, only <hi>Trajan</hi> and <hi>Septimius Severus</hi> dy'd a natural Death; for as for <hi>Antoninus</hi> the Philoſopher, tho he ſuffer'd a Perſecution in <hi>Aſia,</hi> yet in other parts of his Dominions the Chriſtians were unmoleſted, and ſerved him in his Army, where they fought for him ſo effectually, as well with their Prayers as with their Swords, that he acknowledged to the <hi>Senate,</hi> as much hated as they were, that certainly the Chriſtians had God for their Protector. All the reſt came to untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ends; either their own Executioners, or Murdered by their own Souldiers and Servants; tho none ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably puniſhed for their Cruelties as <hi>Valerian,</hi> who being vanquiſhed by <hi>Sapor</hi> the <hi>Perſian,</hi> was by him made his Foot, ſtool when he took Horſe, and at length was flead alive. What occaſioned the <hi>Coſſac</hi> War ſo prejudicial to <hi>Poland,</hi> but becauſe the <hi>Ruſſian Polonians</hi> of the <hi>Catholic Religion</hi> would have forc'd the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> to the Obſervation of their Churches, and to that end have ſhut up the <hi>Grecian</hi> Churches? What occaſioned the Revolt of the <hi>Ruſtic's</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Huſſites</hi> in <hi>Bohemia?</hi> What occaſioned the <hi>League</hi> of <hi>Smalcald,</hi> and the cruel VVar that enſued, but the Oppreſſion of the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks?</hi> By which all that was got was this, that the Bloody <hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi> ſatisfy'd their Revenge with the ſlaughter of the poor People; while the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge'd
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93327:10"/>
their hatred, and Sacrific'd to their Antipathy the VVealth and Religious Structures of their Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and between both, whole Regions and Countries were depopulated and ruin'd. VVhat loſt <hi>Philip</hi> the Second ſo fair a Portion of his Dominions, but his ſeverity in forcing Conſcience? But his bigotted Zeal to gratify the Intereſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> by ſuffering his Grand Executioner <hi>Alva</hi> to ride Triumphantly in the Chariot of the Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated Inquiſition, over the Necks of his tender-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcienc'd Subjects, till he had by all manner of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments disburden'd the Countrey of no leſs then eighteen thouſand Innocent Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>The Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, deform'd with Civil VVars, with various ſucceſs of Battel, with Seiges and Sacks of Cities and Towns, and havock of his Subjects, was rendered yet more in famous by the Pariſian Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre, then which, there never was a more Inhumane piece of Barbarity known among the Heathens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But what was the Advantage of their Butche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? What the Iſſue of it to the King, after he had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptyed his Kingdom of ten thouſand of his Subjects, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which five hundred all Perſons of Quality? In the firſt place, upon too late a Conſideration, a deep Repentance for having given his Conſent, and a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution had he liv'd to have Puniſhed his Adviſors: then every Night his Slumbers interrupted with nocturnal Terrors, till having linger'd under moſt grievous and tedious Pains, and long perceiv'd his death approach before he dy'd; he ended his days a young Youth, in the 24th Year of his Age.</p>
            <p>To omit the loſs of the Low-Countries, by reaſon of the cruelty of the Inquiſition, we find the People in all places the moſt devoted and accuſtomed to Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Rigour, mutinying even to Blood-ſhed, againſt the Torments of that Tribunal.</p>

In <hi>Naples, Peter</hi> of <hi>Toledo</hi> the Viceroy, in Obedience to the Pope, would fain have brought it in; but when he began to put it in Execution, it caus'd ſuch an Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar among the People, that it came to be almoſt a petty VVar between the <hi>Commonalty</hi> and the <hi>Garriſon,</hi> wherein many were ſlain on both ſides, ſo that the Viceroy was forc'd to deſiſt in his deſign; neither has any offer been made to obtrude any ſuch kind of Office upon that Kingdom ever ſince.</p>
            <p>Even in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, the People deteſted the Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Inquiſition to that degree, that the Breath was no ſooner out of the Body of <hi>Paul</hi> the IV. but that they went with great furie to the new Priſon of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, brake down the Doors and let out all the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners therein detained, &amp; could hardly be reſtrained from ſetting on fire the Church of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> as being the Perſons entruſted with the Execution of that rigid Employment More then that, in deteſtation of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, all enrag'd, they forc'd their way into the Palace, and meeting the Popes Statue all of Parian Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and a noble piece of Workmanſhip, they cut off the Head and the right Hand, and for three days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kickt them about the ſtreets, and made them the ſport of the whole City.</p>

Magiſtrate, out of the good Opinion he has of thoſe that make the clamour, not preſently diſcerns the Trapan which is put upon them to make Laws for the puniſhment of thoſe Perſons, over whom they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed no juriſdiction; till at length the ill uſe of thoſe Laws better informs their judgement, and that they were impoſed upon to frame Perſecuting Statutes, and authorize Proſecutions, not to prevent diſturbances in Government, but to gratifie the Pride and Ambition of their hot-headed Adviſers; hence under pretence of diſaffection to the Civil Power, continual Plots and Treaſons are diſcovered, and the diſcovery ſo well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, that ſome are Hanged, others Fin'd, others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to long Impriſonment.

And indeed the grounds of the pretence are the only crimes committed againſt them; all that will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to their Ceremonies are ſuppoſed to be ſeditious Perſons; none that go to Meetings and Conventicles can be Good and Loyal Subjects: and therefore all that will not Conform, or Refrain from going to Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, muſt be ſcourged with the ſcorpions of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Cenſure and Excommunication; muſt be amerc'd at pleaſure, Impriſon'd till Submiſſion, many to their utter Impoveriſhment, or till they pine away in Jayle: and they that would live peaceably and quietly under the Government, can have no reſt in their own Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.

into forraign Countries, and the Prince loſes the Aſſiſtance of the Wealth and Perſons of ſo many of his Subjects, to the ruine of the Kingdom and ſcandal of the Government. A ſort of Chriſtian Politicks which the Church of <hi>England</hi> could only learn from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable bigotrie of that ſame Prince, who cryed out, That he would rather chooſe to be King of a Countrey without People; then of a Kingdome Peopled with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riticks: Contrary to the ſaying of <hi>Adrian,</hi> one of the wiſeſt among the Roman Emperours, That he wiſhed his Empire ſtrengthed rather by the encreaſe of People and Inhabitants, then exceſs of Treaſure. But this was neither the Policy of the Antient Heathens, nor of the more prudent Common wealths and Governments of latter Ages.</p>
            <p>Among all the Heathen Nations that we meet with in Hiſtory, the <hi>Egyptions</hi> were the firſt from whom all the world beſide, the Jews excepted, deriv'd that ſame Dark Knowledge which the other had of the Gods and Divine Worſhip. Their early Superſtition had ſet up no leſs then twelve Divinities to begin withal, who were all worſhip'd in various Shapes with various Rites and Ceremonies; all which with their ſeveral Portraitures and Sacred Myſteries (for ſo they call'd the Rites of Adoration belonging to every Idol) the <hi>Grecians</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards tranſlated into their own Countrey, and for a while exactly obſerved the Precepts and Methods of their firſt Inſtructors. Here was a great number of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities with every one a particular form of worſhip attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and yet we do not find that the <hi>Grecians</hi> were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to tranſport them all into their ſeveral Cities, for fear leaſt the variety of Superſtitions, ſhould ſet their People together by the Ears, while one Prieſt cry'd up his Divinity, another extoll'd his, and ſhatter'd the Vulgar into Factions and Contentions, which was the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93327:12"/>
beſt. No, the Prieſts were ſtill contented with what followers they had, and every man was left to his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to worſhip what Divinity he pleas'd, as his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Devotion govern'd him. A ſtrange misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to Chriſtian Religion, that the Heathens ſhould be ſo conformable in the midſt of ſo much varietie of feign'd Divinities, and we not be able to adjuſt thoſe few Ceremonies in diſpute relating to the worſhip of the true and one God, when we have his own inſpir'd Scripture for our Guide.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Athens</hi> there were as many Sects and Opinions day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught, as there were almoſt Philoſophers in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and many differing in their Sentiments even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Gods themſelves. Yet the Magiſtrate was never call'd upon for their Suppreſſion, but rather they were cheriſh'd and honour'd with Statues after their Death. The Magiſtrates, Rulers and greateſt Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of that Age were their Hearers and Diſciples, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering at pleaſure to whom they thought fit, as their Reaſon and Judgement lead them. And this publick Toleration it was that render'd <hi>Athens</hi> one of the moſt Famous and Flouriſhing Cities of the World. Nor was <hi>Socrates</hi> puniſh'd for introducing an innovation in their Religion, but becauſe he neither could inform his Judges, nor they were able to underſtand who that God was, therefore they put him to Death for injuring all the reſt whom they believ'd to be as true as his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Deity.</p>
            <p>I paſs but lightly over the <hi>Jews,</hi> by reaſon they had the knowledge of the true <hi>God,</hi> and were oblig'd not to engage in the Superſtitions of the Heathens; yet were they not ſo rigid neither as to exclude the <hi>Gentiles</hi> from among them, but had their <hi>Atrium Gentium</hi> for their Reception, altho unconverted; nor did they refuſe the Sacrifices and Oblations of the the Kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi>

nor thoſe of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Fiberius;</hi> all which they thought no breach of their Laws to offer up in their Holy Temples.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Gentiles, this is farther to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, that they were ſo far from Suppreſſing varietie of Opinions, that they took no notice of the many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Poets, that dayly uttered ſuch irreverent and mean Thoughts of their ador'd Divinities, as to make them Robbers, Adulterers and Drunkards; incident to all the frailties, and guilty of all the Crimes that the worſt of men can be ſaid to commit. How ſoever theſe Fables every day made ſome change or other in their Religon; for the Gods ſtill multiplying by procreation and Canonization of Heroes, <hi>Greece</hi> was ſo ſtockt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſht with Deities, that they ſent whole Colonies of feign'd Divinities among their Neighbours, who gave them free admiſſion, without diſputing the Toleration of their new invented Sacrifices, Luſtrations and other Superſtitions, tho perhaps never heard of before. 'Tis true, their Gods would be ſometimes out of humour; but their particular Prieſts had a care how they puſht their feigned Anger too far, &amp; found out a way by ſome Oracle or other to underſtand their meaning and ſet all right again. However it ſhews that had the Prieſt-hood been as captious then, as ſome of ours at this time, they might have put ſo many Capricio's into the heads, ſometimes of one, and ſometimes of another Idol, as might have given the Civil Magiſtrate no ſmall vexation.</p>
            <p>Among the Romans the Catalogue of their Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded Thirty Thouſand; and their forms of Worſhip were as various as they. For their God <hi>Pan</hi> they had their <hi>Luperci</hi> and <hi>Lupercalia.</hi> For <hi>Ceres</hi> their ſecret Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Female Prieſts. For <hi>Hercules</hi> they had their <hi>Potitij</hi> and <hi>Pinarij.</hi> They had alſo their <hi>Arval Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:93327:13"/>
and their ſixty <hi>Curiones</hi> to offer up Sacrifice in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the ſeveral <hi>Curiae</hi> or Pariſhes in <hi>Rome.</hi> They had their Colledge of <hi>Augurs,</hi> and their <hi>Flamin</hi>'s; for <hi>Mars</hi> they had their <hi>Salij;</hi> for their Goddeſs <hi>Dea Bona,</hi> they had their <hi>Veſtal Nuns;</hi> for <hi>Cybele,</hi> their <hi>Galli</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rybantes.</hi> All this lookt like the Variety of our Sects and Opinions at this day; and yet we never hear of thoſe Contentions, Diſputes and Enmities that rage among us. They never incens'd the Magiſtrate to Perſecution, but as they agreed ſingly together, ſo they agreed in the whole; or if any difference happened among them in point of <hi>Religion,</hi> 'twas but repairing to the Colledge of <hi>Pontiffs,</hi> where their queſtions were immediately reſolv'd, and their determinations never contradicted. And for a farther mark of this general Toleration, we find the <hi>Pantheon</hi> erected, and after it was burnt down, Rebuilt by <hi>Adrian,</hi> where all the Gods were worſhiped in common. Moreover we find mention made in <hi>Sueto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> of <hi>Collegia antiqua et Sacra,</hi> in the Plural Number, upon which <hi>Cujacius</hi> Animadverts, <hi>That the Senate and Princes of the</hi> Roman <hi>People permitted ſeveral Colledges as well for the Exerciſe of Forraign Religion, as of that of their own Countrey:</hi> And <hi>Augustus</hi> confeſt, <hi>That he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Colledges and Aſſemblies of the</hi> Jews, <hi>becauſe he found them to be the Schools of Temperance and Justice,</hi> not as they were reported, <hi>the Seminaries of Sedition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To proceed to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> They were no ſooner grown numerous, but we find them muſter'd in the Armies of the Heathen Emperours, and tolerated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſturbance by <hi>Commodus,</hi> tho a bad Prince; in whoſe time <hi>Pontienus</hi> ſet up a School in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where he publicly Taught the <hi>Chriſtian Religion. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander Severus</hi> gave public Toleration to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> in ſo much that when a Complaint was made to him by the Rabble that kept public Tipling-Houſes, that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93327:13"/>
the <hi>Christians</hi> had taken poſſeſſion of a place to Build a Church in the ground that belonged to them, he return'd for his anſwer, <hi>That 'twas much better that God ſhould be Worſhiped in that place after any form, then that it ſhould be allow'd for Houſes of Debauchery.</hi> And thus we find that Toleration of <hi>Religion</hi> was allow'd ſo long as <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm</hi> continued in the World.</p>
            <p>To theſe ſucceeded <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> the firſt of all the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Emperours that made open Profeſſion of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> By whom we find ſuch an Indulgence given not only to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but to all manner of <hi>Religions,</hi> with the conſent of his Collegue in the Empire, <hi>Licinius;</hi> that we could not omit the Inſertion in this place of the moſt material part of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>At what time, I</hi> Conſtantine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus, <note place="margin">This was finiſhed before the Tranſlation of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctantius,</hi> and therefore as not being borrowed from him, I thought fit to let it paſs with this Advertiſement.</note> 
               <hi>and</hi> Licinius Auguſtus <hi>happily met at</hi> Millain, <hi>and had in Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatever might conduce to the public benefit and ſecurity; among the reſt we thought thoſe things were firſt to be taken care of, which would prove moſt profitable to most men, as relating to the Worſhip of the Supream Deity; to which purpoſe we thought fit to grant to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians and all others, free Liberty to exerciſe what Religion every one best approv'd, to the end we might render that Supream Divinity who ſits in his Coeleſtial Throne, propitious to Us and all the People under our Dominion: Wherefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing this wholſome Counſel, and the Dictates of right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, we thought it our ſafeſt and wiſeſt courſe not to deny Liberty to any one, who either followed the Profeſſion of the Chriſtians, or addicted himſelf to any other Religion which he thought moſt agreeable with his Judgment, that the moſt High God, to whom we freely and heartily yield Obedience, may afford us his wonted Favour and Kindneſs in all our Enterprizes. For this reaſon we give your Excellency to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93327:14"/>
underſtand that it is our pleaſure, that all Reſtraints formerly appearing in your Office in reference to the Chriſtians being diſannull'd, we do now Enact ſincerely and plainly, That every one who has a mind to obſerve the Chriſtian Religion, may freely do it without any diſturbance or moleſtation. Which we have thought fit fully to ſignify to your Excellency, to the end you might understand that we have given free and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute leave to the Chriſtians for the Exerciſe of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And as we have granted this Indulgence to them, ſo your Excellency is likewiſe to underſtand that we have gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſame open and free Liberty to all others to Exerciſe the Religion to which they have choſen to adhere, for the Tranquility of our Reign, to the end that every one may be free in the Election of his Worſhip without any Prejudice from us, either to his Honour or to his Religion. And this we thought fit moreover to decree in reference to the Christians, that their Meeting-Places be reſtor'd them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any heſitation or delay, and without the demand of any Fees or Sums of Money: And if any Fines or Mulcts have been Sequeſter'd formerly into our Exchequer, or taken by any other Perſon, that the ſame be alſo reſtor'd them without the leaſt Diminution. Or if they have any Favour to request further at our hands, let them make choice of any of our Advocates to take care of their Affairs.</hi> [The reſt I omit, as leſs pertinent to our purpoſe.]</p>
            <p>But after them, when the Emperours began to lend an Ear to Eccleſiaſtic Rigour, and Sects became Predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant as they were guarded by the Power and Protection of the Civil Magiſtrate, 'tis a ſtrange thing how ſoon the ſeveral Schiſms and Opinions that had taken root un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the milder ſway of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> began to rend the Church into a thouſand Factions; and whereas a ſingle Colledge of Pontiffs would ſerve the Heathen Prieſt-hood to reſolve their Doubts the Determination's of National Councils could not put a ſtop to the Growing
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93327:14"/>
Controverſies of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but from words they fell to blows; and happy they who could get the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Prince on their ſide, for the other were ſure to go by the worſt. So early was the Civil Power made an Engine to ſupport the Pride and Ambition of Spiritual Contenders. At what time an <hi>Eutychian</hi> Pope, by Name <hi>Horſmiſdas,</hi> having the upper hand, gave this <hi>Motto</hi> for anſwer to all that admoniſh'd him of his Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. <hi>Nos Imperare volumus, nos Imperari nolumus.</hi> It were to be wiſh'd that this <hi>Motto</hi> may not have got too much Footing in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> ſeem'd for a time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminated from the Earth, till we meet with it again among the <hi>Goths,</hi> who as <hi>Procopius</hi> alledges, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the height of all their Conqueſts, compel the vanquiſhed to embrace the <hi>Religon</hi> which they profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but left them to their own: it being always the Maxime of Rulers truly generous, to engage men ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as their Friends then as their Slaves, thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves far more ſafe in a free, then in a compell'd <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to deſcend to latter times, we find that even among the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> all over <hi>Turky,</hi> no man is compell'd to embrace the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Superſtition, but that all People, unleſs the Profeſſors of <hi>Heatheniſh Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> are left to the exerciſe of their own <hi>Religion.</hi> And this, as ſeveral Authors obſerve, was at firſt the chiefeſt means by which the <hi>Turks</hi> enlarged their Empire over the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> VVorld. For that many People rather choſe to live under the <hi>Turk,</hi> permitting them the Liberty of their <hi>Conſciences,</hi> then under the Exorbitant Tyranny of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Inquiſition. And further, others obſerve, That nothing has rendered the <hi>Turk</hi> more powerful then the King of <hi>Spain's</hi> Expulſion of all the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> out of his Territories, in the Year 1609,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93327:15"/>
at what time above a Hundred and twenty Thouſand of thoſe Exiles retir'd into <hi>Africa</hi> and other parts of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, to the great benefit of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who learnt from them to Combat the <hi>Europeans</hi> with their own Weapons, and their own Arts of War.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Perſians</hi> give Liberty to the <hi>Melchites</hi> under the Patriarch of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> who obſtinately maintain all thoſe Errors that were condem'd by the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Florence;</hi> together with the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians</hi> and Chriſtian <hi>Armenians,</hi> who have no Patriarchs of their own; nor are the <hi>Roman Catholics</hi> excluded the chief City of <hi>Iſpahan.</hi> To which we may add their Toleration of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Diſſenting Sects in their own Religion.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Poland,</hi> tho generally the Nobility adhere to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet they prohibit none; and the mixture of <hi>Lutherans, Calviniſts, Socinians, Anabaptiſts, Greeks</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> who there enjoy moſt ample Priviledges, apparently demonſtrates, well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtituted Government to be no Enemy to <hi>Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi> Nor does the ſcrupulous <hi>Muſcovite</hi> exclude thoſe of the <hi>Auguſtan</hi> Confeſſion from having a Church of their own within view of the City of <hi>Moſcow</hi> it ſelf.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Switzers</hi> are a Prudent People appears by the perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent conſtitution of their Government, by them upheld and propagated for ſo many Ages together; their Concord has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them Populous, and their Populouſneſs has made them formidable to all the Neighbouring Princes, by whom they have been all along courted for their Aſſiſtance, and to whom they have been beholding for the chiefeſt part of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts. All this while a People half <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> half <hi>Catholic</hi>'s, yet in general ſo equally unanimous, and in ſome particular Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſo peaceably intermix'd, that you never hear among them, ſince they firſt leagu'd together for the common Security, of any Quarrels or Contentions for Superiority; or of any Fines, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonments, or Baniſhing of the Diſſenting parties; nor do they refuſe their Protection to any that fly from other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to ſeek Tranquility of Conſcience among them. There is the ſame mixture of the two Profeſſions of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Calviniſm</hi> among the <hi>Griſons,</hi> and the ſame Unanimity; and this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by the league of the <hi>Ten Juriſdictions,</hi> by which all Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations concerning Religion are forbid, to prevent Exaſperation and Conteſts among Nations and Friends, tho differing in Opinion.</p>

               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:93327:15"/>
In <hi>Venice</hi> the <hi>Roman Catholic</hi> Religion prevails; yet ſuch is the Prudence and Generoſity of the Government and Governours, that they cannot deny to others that Liberty which they enjoy themſelves; in ſo much that tho they admitted the Inquiſition into their Territories, yet they fil'd it's ſharp Fangs in ſuch a manner, that the malice and fury of it was render'd ineffectual; for they decreed that the Inquiſition ſhould not meddle either with Witches or Inchanters; nor with thoſe that ſhould offer to Buffet an Image, or Lampoon the Vices and Diſorders of the Clergy, nor indeed have any power to prohibit the Printing of any Books whatever. That it ſhould have no power over Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, or ſuch as married two Wives; nor in cauſes of Uſury. That it ſhould have no Juriſdiction over <hi>Jews; Infidels,</hi> or thoſe that follow the Ceremonies of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church; nor any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over any ſecular Trade or Profeſſion; and in all other Cauſes whatever that were brought before the Tribunal of the Inquiſition, they reſerv'd to themſelves the Examination, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and final Determination of the Matter; which indeed was an abſolute Toleration of <hi>Jews, Infidels</hi> and <hi>Greek Chriſtians,</hi> and under that Notion, of all other Opinions that they pleas'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>As to Witches, They gave this reaſon why the Inquiſition ſhould not meddle with them, <hi>For that they were generally Women, a poor People Craz'd in their Underſtandings, and therefore more fitting to be inſtructed by the Miniſter, then puniſhed by the Judge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for Blaſphemy, the puniſhment of it belong'd to the Civil Magiſtrate; and ſo for Bigamy and Uſury.</p>
            <p>As to the Toleration of <hi>Jews, &amp;c.</hi> they argu'd from St. <hi>Paul, That the Eccleſiastical Authority had no power over thoſe that were not in the Church.</hi> And in behalf of the <hi>Greeks</hi> they urg'd, <hi>That the Difference and Diſputes between the</hi> Greek <hi>and</hi> Roman <hi>Church were yet Undetermined, and that therefore it was not ſit the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>ſhould be Judge in her own Cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, Againſt the Prohibition of Books they pleaded, <hi>That it was the way to ſtifle Learning, and prevent the coming forth of many good Books, neceſſary for the Inſtruction of Man kind. That it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd only to the Civil Magiſtrates to prevent the Enormities of Scandalous Writers, and therefore that the Eccleſiaſtie</hi>'s <hi>were not to thruſt their Sickles into other mens Harveſts.</hi> Thus we find the <hi>Venetians,</hi> tho in other things Obedient to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93327:16"/>
in the point of Toleration altogether Diſſenting from it; for they believe it to be their Intereſt to take care, leaſt the People being depriv'd of the Liberty of their Minds, ſhould be aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their Affections from the Government; therefore they are contented that the People ſhould enjoy their Liberty, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they do not diſturb the Public Peace.</p>
            <p>To return into <hi>Germany,</hi> even in <hi>Vienna</hi> it ſelf, the chief City of the Empire, the Emperour <hi>Maximilianus</hi> the Second allow'd the <hi>Evangelic</hi>'s the free exerciſe of their Religion in the <hi>Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery</hi> of the <hi>Minorites,</hi> which tho it were deny'd them by his Son <hi>Rudolphus</hi> the Second, was again by the Indulgence of <hi>Matthias</hi> the Emperour reſtor'd them; ſo that they had their public Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies at <hi>Hornals,</hi> a Village cloſe by the City; within the Walls of which they had beſides the freedom to Baptize, Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Sacrament, and Marry according to their own forms, till <hi>Ferdmand</hi> the Second retracted their priviledges, and forc'd them, whenever the Duty of their Worſhip required, to go as far as <hi>Presburgh</hi> or <hi>Edenburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would be too long to trace the ſeveral Regions of <hi>Germany,</hi> where ſo many Soveraign Princes and Free States, exemplary for their Juſtice and Moderation, foſter <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> as the main ſupport of their Governments. 'Twill be enough to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on briefly thoſe of chiefeſt note; the Dukes of <hi>Saxony, Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwick</hi> and <hi>Lunenburgh,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Wittenbergh</hi> and <hi>Holſatia,</hi> the Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> tho of the Romiſh perſwaſion, the Duke of <hi>Newburgh</hi> and the <hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſen,</hi> the Cities of <hi>Ratisbone, Frankford</hi> upon the <hi>Main,</hi> and <hi>Spire,</hi> where the <hi>Evangelic</hi>'s are allow'd the free exerciſe of their Religion, and meet every Sunday, from ſeven till eight in the Morning, and from twelve till one in the Afternoon: not to omit <hi>Auſpurgh,</hi> where the chief Magiſtrates of the City are half <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and half <hi>Papiſts;</hi> nor thoſe moſt Noble Emporiums of the Northern parts of <hi>Europe, Hamborough, Lubeck, Breme</hi> and <hi>Dantzick:</hi> to which if we ſhould add the <hi>States</hi> of the United <hi>Netherlands,</hi> it would be only to trouble the Reader with what is known to all the World. And yet the Flouriſhing condition of theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Territories, the Number of People, and the Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which they enjoy, apparently Demonſtrate, <hi>That Liberty of Conſcience is no ſuch Enemy to Man-kind, as to be ſo rudely har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs'd and exterminated from the Earth with all the Rigors and Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations that render Life uncomfortable.</hi>

Having thus eſtabliſhed the Truth of <hi>Religions</hi> Toleration up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Foundations of Scripture, Reaſon, Authority and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, certainly the wonder muſt be very great among diſcerning Perſons, that men who boaſt a more refin'd Profeſſion of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion,</hi> who aſpire to Peace, to Love, to Moderation, and Truth toward all men, ſhould with ſo much Paſſion and bitter Animoſity, exerciſe their hatred upon their Brethren, for the Niceties of different Opinions; ſo that if we come to know of what Profeſſion they are, 'tis their imperfection, not their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection that makes the diſcovery: Which preceeds from hence, <hi>That Eccleſiaſtical Functions and Dignities are esteem'd for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and Advantages men reap thereby either of Wealth or Fame.</hi> Which Abuſe once crept into the Church, was the firſt occaſion that many men of Evil Principles greedily thirſted after Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Preferments; and that the love of propagating Sacred Religion degenerated into Avarice and Ambition; and that the Church it ſelf was turn'd into a Theater, where the great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors ſtudied not the plainneſs of True Preaching, but to ſhew the quaintneſs of their Oratory. They never bent their minds to Teach the People, but to Tickle their Ears into an Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Elegant Expreſſions and gingling Satyrs upon Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Papiſts, as they thought their Themes would be moſt pleaſing to their Auditors; which did but Inflame the Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons already rais'd, and beget contempt and hatred to themſelves, and breed an Animoſity not eaſy to be reconcil'd in them who had been ſo rudely, tho undeſervedly handled. No wonder then that nothing remain'd of Primitive Religion beſides the External Worſhip (with which the People rather ſeem'd to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then adore the Supream Divinity) and that Faith was now become no other then Credulity and Prejudice. That very Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, that renders men of Rational Creatures, Brutes; as being that which hinders every Man from making Uſe of his free Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and being able to diſtinguiſh Truth from Falſhood; and which ſeems to have been invented on purpoſe to extinguiſh the Light of the Underſtanding. Piety and Religion are made a Compound of Erroneous Myſteries of Humane Policy; and they who contemn Reaſon, and reject the directions of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as corrupted by Nature; would themſelves be thought to have the Divine Light; tho had they but the leaſt ſpark of Divine Light, they would not ſo proudly inſult, but learn
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93327:17"/>
more Prudently to worſhip God, and as now in Hatred, ſo then in Love, to excel the reſt of their Brethren. Nor would they Perſecute with ſuch an open Hoſtility, thoſe that cannot in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience comply with their Impoſitions, but rather take pity of their failings, unleſs they would be thought more fearful of their own worldly Intereſt, then ſollicitous for the others Salvation.</p>
            <p>Seeing then that the Eſtabliſhing of any Religious perſwaſion by force, is ſo contrary to Scripture, Reaſon and common Sence, it remains then that only <hi>Worldly Intereſt,</hi> and the ſupport of a Domineering Hierarchy, muſt be the chief Motives that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd the late Perſecutors to procure thoſe <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> which in contempt of the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi> and their own <hi>Videmus Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liora</hi>'s, they put ſo rigorouſly in Execution. Laws that puniſh the very ſuppoſition of Crimes and Tranſgreſſions in Conceit; Laws that puniſh the Body with Corporal Vexations for the ſuppoſed Tranſgreſſions of the Mind and Will; Laws that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to dive into the Breaſts of Men, and to diſcover Evil in their Thoughts, as if enacted to torment the Souls of Mankind before their time: In a word, Laws that were aboliſh'd by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as ſoon as made; for if Laws are grounded upon Reaſon, and theſe Laws are contrary to Reaſon, as it is plain they were, for that Laws are made to redreſs, not to increaſe the grievances of the People; then were they null as ſoon as form'd. For if Laws do not ariſe out of <hi>Natural Reaſon,</hi> but are only made to avoid ſome greater miſchief pretended to be foreſeen; we are not raſhly to admit of ſuch an Interpretation, as to make that Sinful or Criminal which is otherwiſe Lawful. Thus to ſeperate from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is a thing no way in it's ſelf Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, and therefore cannot be made Criminal by a Law, there being no natural Equity to make it ſo, and conſequently not Puniſhable by the Law.: Nor can their Meeting in <hi>Conventicles</hi> be a Crime; for that the Doctrine of men that teach thoſe things which are Juſt and Honeſt, can never be fear'd, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when they are exact in their Obedience to the Magiſtrate; nor ſhould their private Aſſemblies be envied or ſuſpected, as being Juſt and Innocent Men, till they are convicted of being otherwiſe. And therefore they that Perſecute ſuch People, ought rather to be Proſecuted themſelves; for that by them the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> is brok'n in doing injuſtice to them that never offended; and it is but natural equity to puniſh thoſe that wrong
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93327:17"/>
their Neighbours without a cauſe. Which Cauſe can never be found in a Law made contrary to Reaſon; in a Law made to gratify the Ambition and Intereſt of a Single Party, to the diſturbance of the Greater part of the Nation, which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Common Good, and conſequently the End of Law.</p>
            <p>Moreover, There is no Humane Law that can command or prohibit an Act, purely directly and <hi>Secundum ſe,</hi> internal. And this is grounded upon the common Axiome, <hi>Cogitationis Paena nemo meretur:</hi> no man incurs the Puniſhment of Thought, for the Law has nothing to do with Internal Acts; and therefore becauſe it cannot naturally and of it ſelf puniſh thoſe Acts, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere neither can it either command or prohibit them; for the Legiſlative Power is Compulſive, and if it cannot be Compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive as to the inward Act, neither can it make a Law in reference to it:</p>
            <p>The reaſon of this Aſſertion is, for that the Legiſlative Power among men is only ordain'd for preſervation of the outward Peace and honeſty of Humane Community, to which thoſe Acts have no Relation which are conceived in the Mind. Then again this Power ſprings immediately from Humane Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it ſelf, by the means of Natural Reaſon. Now there is no Humane Community that can grant a Power immediately and of it ſelf, over Actions meerly Internal, as being altogether without the Limits of its Knowledge, and without the Bounds of its Juriſdiction; for no man is naturally ſubject to another in his Soul, but in his Body. Therefore ſaid a Learned School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>He is in an Error who believes that Servitude lays hold of the whole Man; the better part is excepted.</hi> Our Bodies are lyable to our Superiours and Governours, but the Mind is its own Lord and Maſter.</p>
            <p>Then again, The conditions of Humane Laws are, <hi>That the Law muſt be Honeſt, Juſt, Poſſible, convenient to Time and Place, and conformable to Religion and Reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Penal Laws</hi> are not Honeſt, becauſe they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force men to abandon the worſhip of God, which in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> Ceremonies, which they as firmly believe to be no way neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> for their Salvation, but rather contrary to thoſe Sentiments <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hich they have of the Truth of Sacred Adoration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:93327:18"/>
They are not juſt, becauſe they would bereave men of that Chriſtian Liberty which all men have a priviledge to claim; and which the moſt zealous promoters of the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> would take moſt heavily to be themſelves depriv'd of.</p>
            <p>In the Second place, They ought to command thoſe things which may be juſtly obſerved; but theſe Laws would enforce men to Sin againſt the Dictates of their Conſciences, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is eaſy to any.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Penal Laws</hi> are not agreeable to Religion, for they prohibit what the Laws of God allow, which is <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> and uphold what the Laws of God prohibit, which is Spiritual Tyranny and Dominion in matters of Religion.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The <hi>Penal Laws</hi> are contrary to Reaſon and the common benefit of Civil Society; for it is not rational that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould be Impriſon'd, Fin'd, and Baniſhed, and common ſecurity of Liberty and Property be infring'd even to the loſs of men lives, and the depopulation of a Kingdom, for pretences over which the Civil Magiſtrates pretends not to have any Juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>Add to this, That to rendering Laws effectual, there are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired all the three parts or ſorts of Juſtice. Firſt, <hi>Juſtitia Legalis,</hi> whoſe Office is to aim at the Common Good, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to preſerve the due priviledges of all the Subjects in general. Secondly, <hi>Juſtitia Commutativa,</hi> which requires that the Legiſlator command no more then lies in his power. Thirdly, Diſtributive Juſtice, which takes care that the private good of a few, be not reſpected more then the public good of the whole Body. In all which parts of Juſtice, the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, it follows that they were not duly made, conſequently invalid and no way obliging. And this is the Opinion of all the Famous Caſuiſts, <hi>Aquinas, Sctus, Medina, Caſter, Tolinus, Panormitanus,</hi> and others, conformable to that of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>l. 19. de Civit. Dei. c: 21. The perverſe Conſtitutions of Men are neither to be accounted nor to be ſaid to be Laws; when that is only to be accounted right and juſt, which flows from the Fountain of Juſtice.</hi> Now that it is the intrinſic end of all Laws duly made, to aim at the Common Good, is plain from the Laws of God themſelves, which are ſuch, that tho ordain'd by God himſelf to his own Glory, yet he ſeeks therein not his own advantage, but the good and benefit of men. In like manner as all Humane
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93327:18"/>
Laws are impoſed upon a Community of People, ſo ought they to be made for the general good of that Community, otherwiſe they are irregular; for it is againſt all Juſtice to reduce the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Good to Private Intereſt, or to ſubject the whole to the part for the parts ſake. Another reaſon may be deduc'd from the end it ſelf, for the end muſt be proportionate to the Act, its beginning and efficacy. Now the Law is the common Rule of Moral Operations; therefore the firſt Principle of Moral Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations ought to be the firſt Principle of the Law; but the end or happineſs is the firſt Principle of Moral Operations; for in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals the beginning is the end of the Operations, and ſo the Ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate end is the firſt Principle of ſuch Actions; but the Common Good or Felicity of a City or Kingdom is the Ultimate end of it in its Government, therefore it ought to be the firſt beginning of the Law, and therefore the Law ought to be for the Common Good. Now it is apparent that the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> were made only for the particular good and felicity of the Church of <hi>England</hi> men, all others being by them excluded from the benefit of their native Priviledges, that could not in Conſcience conform to the Ceremonies of their Worſhip, to the Ruin and Vexation of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands, which was poſitively againſt the Common Good and Felicity of the Nation and general Community of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, divided only in ſome points of Religion, but in an equal poiſe of Obedience and Loyalty to the Supream Magiſtrate, and therefore juſtly deſerving equal ſhare of proviſion by the Laws for their Security and Protection. And therefore unleſs it can be prov'd that it is for the Common Good and Benefit of the whole Nation, that men ſhould be perſecuted to uphold the Hierarchy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> are unduly made, and therefore as of no force, to be repeal'd and annul'd. Therefore the Intention of the <hi>Divine Laws</hi> might have taught the Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of theſe <hi>Penal Statutes</hi> better and more Chriſtian Learning; for therefore are Prelates call'd Paſtors, becauſe they ought to lay down their Lives for the good of the Sheep; not the Sheep to lay down their Lives for the good of them: they are call'd Diſpenſers and not Lords; Miniſters of God, not Primary Cauſes, and therefore they ought to be conformable to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Intention in the Exerciſe of their Power: God principally intends the Common Good of men, and therefore his Miniſters are bound to do the ſame. They are Tyrants, not Governours in the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93327:19"/>
Church, while they ſeek their own Support and not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Benefit.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Injuſtice</hi> of the <hi>Penal Laws, experte Materiae,</hi> in commanding thoſe things which ought not to be obſerved, this Axiom from thence ariſes. That no unjuſt Law can be a Law, and then there lies no obligation to accept it, or to obſerve it if ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; for that the Subjects are not only not bound to accept it, but have it not in their power, when the command is clearly and manifeſtly unjuſt: as when men are commanded not to meet above ſuch a number under ſuch a penalty, for the Exerciſe of their Religion according to their Conſciences. This is an Evil Command, becauſe it debars men from the free Worſhip of God; for unleſs it could be prov'd that the Religion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is the only True Religion in the World, and they the only Infallible Miniſters upon Earth, it is unjuſt in any Law to conſtrain others to believe that, which may be as Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous in them, as what the other profeſſes: For tho I may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be the pureſt form of Supplication under Heaven, yet another may not believe ſo, neither is it a Crime in him to believe otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>We have ſaid that the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> are defective in point of Honeſty, which is another reaſon why they are invalid, and therefore to be annull'd. For the Immorality of the Precept is contrary to God himſelf, becauſe it includes a Crime and a Tranſgreſſion againſt God, and therefore ought not to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd as no way obligatory: ſeeing that it behoves us to obey God rather then Man, which is the reaſon theſe Laws ought not to be obſerved, as contradicting our Obedience to God, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting us to the Compulſions of Men.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place, no Law can be valid beyond the Intention of the Legiſlators. Now it is not rational to think that thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who made the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> upon a preſumption of danger from Factious and Turbulent Spirits, ever intended thoſe Laws ſor the puniſhment of thoſe that liv'd peaceably and obediently toward the Government in all the Paſſive Duties of good Loyal Subjects, for that had been to make Laws for the puniſhment of good men, which was never the deſign of any juſt and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Legiſlator in this World. Now then the Preſumption of the danger being remov'd by his Majeſties moſt <hi>Gracious Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi> the Foundation of the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> are remov'd, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93327:19"/>
the Obligation to them; for it is not to be imagin'd that the Framers of theſe Laws ever meditated to Eſtabliſh the Dominion of a Spiritual Oligarchy upon the Ruin of ſo many Families of Pious and Religious People; and therefore the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which were the grounds of theſe Laws being vaniſh'd, the Laws themſelves are to be laid aſide, as altogether vain and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous, and ſuch as have only ſerv'd to gratify the Revenge and Animoſity of their promoters: for we never hear'd of Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors or Factious Perſons, that were ever try'd upon thoſe Laws, there being others of greater force to take hold of ſuch Criminals.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Test,</hi> it appears to be an Oath continued to prevent the ſitting of any Commoner or Peer in either of the Houſes of Parliament, from coming into his Majeſties Preſence or Court, and from bearing any Office or Imployment, Military or Civil, in any of his Majeſties Realmes of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland, &amp;c.</hi> And they that are to take this Oath, are thereby to abjure the belief of Tranſubſtantiation, Invocation or Adoration of Saints, and the Sacrifice of the Maſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Learned are of Opinion, That to make an Oath binding, it is requiſite that it refers to things Lawful; for that if the thing promiſed upon Oath be forbidden either by the Law of Nature, or by the Divine Laws, or Interdicted by the Laws of Men, it has no power to oblige the Swearer.</p>
            <p>Now the Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="6 letters">
                  <desc>••••••</desc>
               </gap>n will be whether this Oath does not poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> Laws of the Land, by enforcing a Peer of the Realm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or any other free-born <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> of lower Degree, to ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uſe himſelf, with ſo ſtrong and dangerous a Temptation to Perjury, where the Choice is only this, Either to forſwear their Religion, or loſe their Native Priviledges and Preferments, and all poſſibility of advancing their Fortunes. A piece of ſeverity that conſtrains the inward Belief of the Mind, <hi>which God the ſearcher of all Hearts has reſorv'd to himſelf.</hi> That this is an Act contrary to the known Laws of the Land, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true, as is apparent from the great Charter, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Statutes of the Realm; therefore the <hi>Teſt</hi> has no power to oblige the Swearer, and conſequently to be repeal'd as Uſeleſs.</p>
            <p>That it is againſt the Law of God, is apparent from hence, for that there is nothing more ſtrongly prohibited in Scripture,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93327:20"/>
then to ground a Penal Proſecution upon the enforc'd Oath of the Party without Witneſs or Accuſer.</p>
            <p>In the next place it ſeems a hard caſe to oblige the Papiſt to Swear away his Religion, before he has another provided for him by thoſe that Impoſe the Oath. For certainly Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation is no point of State: nor does the Doctrine of good Works make a man a good Subject: and it is poſſible for a Papiſt to be Loyal to the Supream Authority, and yet believe there is a Purgatory. All theſe are no Fundamental points of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith, clearly ſet down in Scripture, but infer'd from paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and glances of the Text, to which the Anſwers are believ'd as probable by the Papiſts, as the Objections againſt them by us; and therefore there is no reaſon they ſhould be ſo cruelly <hi>Teſted</hi> for Doctrines that are but either obſcurely reveal'd, or not neceſſarily enjoyn'd. As little reaſon is there to enforce this <hi>Teſt</hi> upon the Papiſts, when we know that many of our own perſwaſions would Scruple to take it, and ſome ſo nice as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to refuſe it. At leaſt it is very ſevere to compel ſuch as are young and unlearned (for all are not Caſuiſts that enter the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Houſe, or have Preferment in the Kingdom) to Swear that ſuch an Opinion or Doctrine is not true, which they have been always bred up to from their Infancy; eſpecially to come bluntly upon them without any preceding Inſtructions or endeavours to convince their Underſtandings, only Swear or elſe depart the Kings Preſence and quit your Imployment.</p>
            <p>But all this is done, they ſay to prevent the growth of Popery, and ſecure the Publick Peace: as if the taking the <hi>Teſt</hi> would avail to make a man either a better Neighbour or a better Subject. For Experience tells us, That they who impoſe this <hi>Test,</hi> conſide never the more in thoſe whom they have frighted to take it; and tho by taking it they may preſerve what places they have, yet is it not in it ſelf any ſtep to Preferment. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed is there leſs reaſon to conſide in thoſe that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly drawn to an outward Complyance, then in thoſe that Obſtinately refuſe to be obliged; ſince there can be no greater cauſe of Hatred and Reſentment, then the remembrance of their being compell'd publickly to Swear againſt their Conſciences; unleſs their Judgments are really chang'd, and then all Penalties to enforce them are ſuperfluous. Whence it muſt be concluded, that the <hi>Teſts</hi> and all <hi>Oaths</hi> of that nature, are always either ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93327:20"/>
pernicious or altogether unneceſſary: if againſt the inward Judgment, damnable, as being the higheſt degree of Perjury, and Spiritual Murder of the Soul; if according to the Internal Sentiments, uſeleſs. More then this, it was the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Iſidore, That a man ought to make no ſcruple to break an Oath that would bind him to a diſhoneſt and unjuſt Action: for that the promiſe muſt needs be wicked that cannot be fulfill'd, but by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a man wicked. And what can make a man more wicked then to renounce his Religion for private Gain?</hi> So that if the <hi>Teſt,</hi> as it is an Oath that would bind a man to ſuch an unjuſt Action, as the Renouncing his Religion for Worldly Honour or Preferment, may be ſo eaſily broken, to what purpoſe is it kept on foot? Since it has not power enough to bind the Perſon that takes it. And indeed, if the power of an unjuſt Oath were ſo great as ſome would make us believe, how deeply are they Perjur'd that took the Covenant and Engagement, yet after that were ſo Inſtrumental in Reſtoring of his late Majeſty of Bleſſed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, whoſe Right and Title to the Crown they had ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly abjur'd. But they have their Abſolution from St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> who tells us, <hi>That ſome Promiſes cannot be perform'd, nor ſome others kept without the Violation of our Duties both to God and Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon theſe conſiderations we have juſt reaſon to believe it was, that our Supream Legiſlator and Soveraign Prince ſet forth his moſt Gracious <hi>Act of Indulgence,</hi> thereby to free from Spiritual Bondage, the Enflav'd Conſciences of his Suffering Subjects, Groaning under the Tyranny of Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Therein truly reſembling the Divine Majeſty, whoſe Vicegerent upon Earth he is, while he ſheds down down upon all in general, the Rayes of his Chriſtian Compaſſion, and ſpreads the Cherubim Wings of his Mercy over multitudes ſo latety tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the Unſanctified Vexation.</p>
            <p>He has publicly declar'd it to be his Aim to fix his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on ſuch a Foundation as may make his Subjects happy in the Enjoyment of their Religion with freedom of Exerciſe, and their Property without Invaſion.</p>
            <p>Under the Reign of ſuch a Prince, whom God preſerve, what Cauſe or Grounds can there be for Fears or Jealouſies? 'Tis an ill ſign of Obedience in Subjects, when they diſtruſt the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Declarations of their Prince: And on the other ſide, to deny him ſo ſmall a Recompence for his Exceſs of Benignity in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93327:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his <hi>Royal Toleration,</hi> as the Repeal of Cruelty and Injuſtice; Cruelty in the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> and Injuſtice in the <hi>Teſt;</hi> is the higheſt Ingratitude in the World. Certainly it cannot be thought but that a Monarch ſo tender of the Liberties and Conſciences of his Subjects, muſt be ill at eaſe till he has removed thoſe Scourges of Impoſition that hang over their Heads in ſuch a Threatning poſture. And therefore ſince Soveraign Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration thinks it meet to have them taken away, 'tis a very rude piece of Obſtinacy, to be Froward and Peeviſh in Oppoſition to Soveraign Reaſon.</p>
