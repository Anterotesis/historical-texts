            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>That good Phyſitians doe applie themſelues to the preſent Time, and to take hold of the Occaſion.</hi> The <hi>preſent Time</hi> (good Reader) is <hi>Woefull,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Occaſion, Dangerous</hi>: I know it was not his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that we ſhould onely grieue for the firſt, and flee from the latter; but to lend our aſſiſtance to the neceſſitie of the Times ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie. I haue but little water to draw, yet would I gladly bring my bucket-full to the quenching of this contagious flame; and if it be but kindly regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; I am friendly rewarded: for I profeſſe, not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation, but true affection; not a hope of prayſe, but a heart of pittie, draws me (or rather driues me) to offer my counſell in this caſe. LONDON is my Mother; in her wombe had I both Birth and Bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. What Sonne can ſee his Mother woefully af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, dangerouſly ſicke, and deſperately forſaken; but he muſt needs weepe for her teares, labour her recovery, and lend a hand (at leaſt) to hold her vp?

the <hi>Plague</hi> now, would proue a plague to my Practiſe hereafter) but I muſt labour to preſerue the ſound; becauſe by profeſſion I am a Phyſition. Therefore I call this Booke, <hi>A Watch-man for the Pest,</hi> becauſe it doth onely (as if it were a Warder) ſtand at the dore without, and deliver things neceſſary for preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe within; but neither enters the infected houſe, nor meddles with the Cure of the Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. I expect from diverſe conceits diverſe Cenſures of this Booke. It is too long, too ſhort, too ſolid, too idle, too full, too ſlender; and I know not what. Yet I hope the judicious will vouchſafe it the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; and the wiſe, the obſerving: as for the reſt, I will neither favour the Frivolous, feare the Envious, nor flatter the Curious. I know though <hi>Hercules</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour his heart out, he ſhall not be able to appeaſe a <hi>Iuno,</hi> nor pleaſe an <hi>Euryſtheus.</hi> Therefore if I be not reliſhed, I ſhall thinke the mouth is out of taſte, ſince there is ſcarce a word, but I can proue his worth from good Authoritie. If I be gratefull to thy palate (good Reader) I will not be vngratefull to thy perſon; But if ever thou wilt vſe me, thou ſhalt finde me</p>

As for Mattriſes, Mats, and ſuch like, it is beſt that they be burnt, for that is the ſureſt way to free them from infection.</p>
                  <p>But now, Some men cannot, and ſome muſt not flie.<note place="margin">Who muſt not flee.</note> Some through povertie, and want of friends in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; or by reaſon of the dependance of their living vpon the Towne infected, cannot leaue it.

Shunne all places that are moyſt and wet. In Summer keepe you temperate, but alwayes drie: in Winter keepe warme, and as much as you can, neare the fire.

                     <note place="margin">Purging of the Generall Aire.</note> That is to be purged and rectified, firſt by cleane ſweeping and waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſtreets, lanes, courts, allyes and other wayes and paſſages of the Cittie; leaving in them no durtie pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, dunghills, or dead carrions.

It is true, that the breath of thoſe Cattell are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſweet and wholſome: But it is to be doubted, that the impure Aire being much more in quantity then their breath, will ſooner infect them, then they purifie it; which if it doe, then ſurely all their fleſh will proue but vnhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome meat, and may infect more bodies after they haue bene at the Butchers; then they haue purified ſtreets while they went before the drovers.

                  <p>I cannot ſtand to diſpute the caſe deepely:<note place="margin">Tobacco.</note> But I will briefly ſhew my opinion. <hi>Tobacco hath theſe manifeſt Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: It is Heating and Drying; it evacuateth groſſe Humors; it draweth away Rheums; it provoketh Vrine, and keepeth the belly ſoluble.</hi> There may be ſome times, and ſome bodies wherein a Medicine having theſe opening qualities may be vſed; as namely, to a Cold and Flegmaticke complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, full of groſſe humors; the partie for the time keeping himſelfe warme, and within dores. But for the common faſhion of taking it, by every man, every day (yea almoſt every houre) in ſhops and open places, without conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of conſtitution, or iuſt cauſe; I cannot approue of it at all: much leſſe as any <hi>Antidote.</hi> But let vs examine it a little further, for their ſakes that would vſe it more orderly:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:16086:16"/>
and ſee whither it may be accounted a <hi>Preſervatiue Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine</hi> or no. I haue already reckoned the beſt qualities it hath, being taken in the Pipe (for ſo onely I diſcourſe of it) and the firſt of thoſe qualities indeed ſhews a faire countenance to the caſe: But the foure latter talke too much of penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and evacuation: wherewith it opens the pores, and makes the body fit to receiue the contagious aire; it alſo diſſolues the braine, and cauſeth the humors thereof to fall downe into all parts of the body diſtempered with a heat contrary to nature; wherupon it enflames the blood, turns it to melancholy, and reſteth not till it haue alſo turned Blacke Choller into Burnt Choller.

For we know that garments will a long time retaine any ſtrong or ſweete ſent wherewith they haue beene fumed, or with which they haue beene layd vp; now the Sent is meerely a quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and his ſubſtance is the Aire, which is the vehiculum or ſeat of the Sent wherein it is carried, &amp; by which it is made permanent.

ſpace of time were both ſmitten and ſlaine. The longeſt time of Striking being but three dayes, namely that for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> numbering the people. In thoſe plagues therefore the cauſe was onely ſupernaturall: for there was no time allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for corruption and putrefaction of the Aire. But in theſe of ours (and in very many moe in all Countreys and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and in all Ages of the World) there hath beene ſufficient time to breed and increaſe the Contagion in the Aire: in which time of breeding alſo, the antient naturall obſervations haue beene found true from age to age; for many noyſome things haue apparently diſcovered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as fruits of the Aires putrefaction, and Prognoſticks of the Plague threatened. And when it hath begun, it ſpreads but by degrees; firſt ſtriking one man onely; then two or three; after that a few more; and ſo multiplying the ſucceeding number, as it evidently groweth more contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by the number of bodies already infected. Beſides thoſe Plagues before mentioned, doe diſcover a <hi>ſtroke,</hi> but no <hi>ſickneſſe</hi>; but that of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> diſcovered a <hi>ſickneſſe</hi> and no <hi>ſtroke</hi> of any Angell.

                  </p>
                  <p>And to finde this we muſt firſt know that <hi>bodies are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected two wayes</hi>; firſt, <hi>from without, in regard of the Aire</hi>; and ſecondly, <hi>from within, in reſpect of the preſent ſtate of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</hi>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:16086:26"/>
the pores) increaſeth her putrefaction (by the heat within) vnto the greater malignitie, and ſo becommeth Peſtilent.</p>
                  <p>Therefore thoſe bodies that are moyſt, and full of iuice; whoſe veines are ſtreit (and therefore apter to intercept then intertaine the iuices) and the thickneſſe of whoſe skin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the tranſpiration of the excrements; theſe are eaſily po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted and infected.</p>
                  <p>And ſuch are Women; eſpecially women with childe, for their bodies are full of excrementitious iuices, &amp; much heat withall; which is as oyle and flame put together.</p>
                  <p>Alſo thoſe that are very Coſtiue, or haue their water ſtopped; the noyſome vapours that are by theſe excrements ingendered, make the body ſubiect to infection.</p>
                  <p>Young children, in regard of their tender and ſoft bodies are apt to admit of any alteration vpon the lighteſt occaſion: and becauſe they fetch their breath ſhort (having but little roome for reſpiration) they draw in much Aire, with which the ſeed of Contagion is attracted: and ſo are apt to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected from without. And likewiſe becauſe they are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally moyſt, and feed vpon the moyſter kindes of meates; and feed alſo with more appetite then iudgement; they are therefore the more ſubiect to peſtilent infection from within.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe, the ſanguine and delicate faire complexion, (whoſe bloud and iuices are finer and thinner then others, and therefore more ſubiect to mutation) are quickly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: for the <hi>Plague</hi> is able to inſinuate it ſelfe into all the humors; but into ſome more eaſily then others; as into Bloud firſt, Choler next, Fleam after, and Melancholie laſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Poore People,</hi> (by reaſon of their great want) living ſlut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhly, feeding naſtily on offals, or the worſt &amp; vnholſomeſt meates; and many times too long lacking food altogether; haue both their bodies much corrupted, and their Spirits exceedingly weakened: whereby they become (of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) moſt ſubiect to this Sickneſſe. And therefore we ſee the <hi>Plague</hi> ſweeps vp ſuch people in greateſt heapes.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:16086:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Indeed in regard of the Aire, <hi>the rich</hi> are as ſubiect as they; for both breath the ſame: and delicacie of feeding makes the rich as apt to corruption: But then they haue meanes to get holſome food, good attendance, and precious Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes to preſerue them; for we ſee by experience that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary things doe little prevaile. And this is the reaſon alſo why feweſt of the Rich doe die of the <hi>Plague.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Great Eaters and Drinkers (who can never be free from crudities) as alſo <hi>Luxurious idle livers,</hi> and <hi>Whore hunters</hi> (who ſpend the ſtrength of their bodies prodigally) are very apt to be infected.</p>
                  <p>Alſo ſuch as in former times haue had cuſtomary eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations by ſweat, haemorrhoids, vomitings, menſtrua, fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanells, or other like wayes of expelling noxious humors; and haue them now ſtopped.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe likewiſe that faſt much (their bodies being emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) receiue more Aire in, then they let out.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe alſo that are Fearefull; as I haue alreadie ſhewed in the point of Paſſions.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, neareneſſe of bloud or kindred, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſympathy of natures, maketh men very apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue infection from one of their owne bloud.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt and <hi>Inward Signe,</hi> is a <hi>Feavor.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Feavor.</note> As ſoone as the Heart is ſtricken with the putrid vapour, the Spirits grow diſtempered and inflamed. And this diſtemperature is a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor (not Proper, but Symptomaticall or Accidentall) and this Feavor is not of one kinde in every one; but diverſe, and ſuch are his Symptoms alſo. As ſometime Pleuriticke, ſometime Squinanticke, ſometimes Cholericke, ſometimes Continuall, and ſometimes Intermitting.</p>
                  <p>Theſe diſtempers relate the cruell Combate begun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Nature and her M<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>The <hi>outward Signes</hi> bring Newes of the Hopes or Feares to which ſide the Victorie is like to fall. For, if Nature ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell any part of the venom outward, it is a ſigne of ſome ſtrength in her.</p>

                  <p>If the <hi>Botch</hi> or great Apoſtumation riſe.<note place="margin">Botch.</note> Then hath Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a crowd of corrupt matter to encounter with; an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of Enemies, againſt which ſhee ſtoutly beſtirres her ſelfe.

                  <p>And by the places where ſhe driues them out; it appeares, againſt which of the three Caſtles of Nature the greateſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault is given and continued.</p>

                  <p>But that the colours of theſe bloudy Enſignes, may the better be diſcovered, I will play the Herald, and blazon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Signe by himſelfe.

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Tokens</hi> are Spots of the bigneſſe of Flea-bitings,<note place="margin">The Tokens deſcribed.</note> ſome bigger, ſome as bigge as a penny. They ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues commonly in the breſt and backe; but they will ſometimes appeare in other places alſo. In ſome they will be many, in ſome but a few, in others but one or two. In colour they are for the moſt part of a pale blew, but ſomtimes alſo purple or blackiſh, circled with a reddiſh circle.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Blayne</hi> is a little Bliſter ſomwhat like one of the <hi>Swine-Pocks</hi>; and many times of the ſame colour;<note place="margin">The Blayne.</note> but ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, of a blewiſh or leaden colour; and being opened, affordeth filthy matter of the like complexion. Round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Bliſter, there is a redneſſe the breadth of a groat, ſix-pence, or nine-pence: Theſe will riſe in any part: ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one alone, ſomtimes two or three; but never very many. And theſe will breake, and fall, and leaue a dry cruſt, which will ſcale off.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Botch</hi> is a hard ſwelling,<note place="margin">The Botch.</note> riſing as I ſayd before in the necke, vnder the eares, or vnder the chinne; in the armepits; &amp; in the groynes. It ſwelleth ſomtimes no bigger then a Nutmeg; ſomtimes as bigge as a Wall-nut; others as a Hens egge, and ſome as bigge as a Mans fiſt. Alſo in ſome it ſwelleth out very fully to be ſeene plainly, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth ſo ſoare that it can endure nothing to touch it; in others it lieth low and deepe in the fleſh, onely to be found by feeling; and ſomtimes alſo ſcarcely to be felt; but if you touch the place, it is painfull. Thoſe that lie high and plaine to be ſeene, are more hopefull; the low lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ones are very ominous and pernicious.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Carbuncle</hi> riſeth like a little puſh or puſtle,<note place="margin">The Carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</note> with a prettie broad compaſſe of redneſſe round about it. It is wonderfull angry, and furiouſly enflaming, as if a quicke
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:16086:29"/>
coale of fire were held to the place: whence it hath his name <hi>Carbunculus, a little coale of fire.</hi> It creepeth ſecretly in the fleſh next vnder the skin, and is full of ſuch a furious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant poyſon, as it will quickly conſume and eate out ſo great a peece of fleſh (for the capacitie it is in) as a man would wonder how it could ſo ſuddainly be done: being as if one did burne a hole with a hot iron. And it is ſtrange to ſee that ſo ſmall a tumor ſhould be ſo deviliſh and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to life: for if it be not with great care, and exceeding good meanes attended, it bringeth ſpeedy death.</p>

                     <note place="margin">How to know if one be dead of the Plague, when neither Spots, Blayne, Botch, nor Carbuncle appeare. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iohn Baniſter.</hi>
                     </note>But moreover obſerue this.

That is, that after ſuch a body is dead, in one place or other the fleſh will grow ſofter then the reſt: and the whole body will alſo grow ſofter &amp; ſofter, and the longer the body lies, the ſofter will be the fleſh. Which ſhews the vileneſſe of the putrefaction within. <hi>Heurnius</hi> mentions this alſo among his ſignes in his booke <hi>De Peſte</hi>; and addeth alſo theſe.<note place="margin">
