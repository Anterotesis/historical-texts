            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THE Third Perſon in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Trinity, one God bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for ever, is frequently abuſed by the pretences of men, to ſuch Revelations as are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the truths of the Goſpel,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100880:6"/>
and many Doctrines of the Chriſtian Religion, which the Holy Ghoſt at firſt inſpired men to deliver: And though this began in the Apoſtles days, when the myſtery of iniquity, by the <hi>Gnoſtick</hi> defection, began to work: Yet it has continued and improved men in their villanies throughout the ſeveral Ages of the Church: Nay ſo far that Treaſon, and Murder, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Rebellion, are conſecrated by thoſe that pretend to be inſpired; and they blaſphemouſly make the Holy Spirit of God, that breaths forth peace and quietneſs upon the World, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Patron of the greateſt and moſt diſturbing impieties that ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted the Societies of mankind. This, though, we have been loth to believe it, we are now convinc'd of by a woful experience; an experience which had been purchaſed by our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruine, unleſs Gods Providence, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting, and favouring the wiſdom of our Superiours, encouraged by ſome Loyal and unwearied reſolutions, had happily prevented it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We have two ſorts of men, (both pretending to an infallible inſpiration, though on different grounds) that ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100880:6"/>
the Principles of Chriſtianity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſhew to advance them: And though we were unwilling to think that men who ſeem'd at ſo great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from each other, ſhould ever reach to join hand in hand, and that the ſame principle ſhould reconcile ſuch different pretenſions: Yet as <hi>Samſon</hi>'s <hi>Foxes</hi> were joined together by their Tails, though their heads looked away from one another; So now we ſee thoſe that breath inſpirations from the Pope, and they that boaſt more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ones from Heaven confederating, (though before expected by the moſt obſerving and conſiderate men) to houſe the corn and tares together, that Gods Harveſt may become their own, and they may reap where they never ſowed: And certainly when ſuch at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts both by a ſeparate, and united force, are made againſt all Order and Religion, intitling God to the Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of a lie, making the Spirit of Truth to contradict himſelf, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying Chriſt, under a pretence to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt him: when our own Kingdoms are ready to be deſtroyed by cheating us out of our Properties, and our Lives, with a ſpecious ſhew of advancing the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100880:7"/>
Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, and, to lift up his Scepter, our Soveraign's muſt firſt be broken in pieces: when diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders tending to ſubverſion and ruine, are plainly legible in the affairs of men; coals are blowing to ſet all our Houſes on fire, and we tread thoſe paths that will lead us to confuſion, and all this while men profeſs to be ſerving a God of Order: when mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes pretend to be ſent from God, that ſpeak contrary to his written word, and have no other Miracle to prove their Principles, but the ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their villany in rooting up the Laws of Nature and Society: when ſo much braſs is currant amongſt us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of gold, and our ſilver is every day exchang'd for droſs, and we are ready to be made the companions of <hi>Owls,</hi> or what is worſe, of Thieves and Murderers; 'tis high time to bring forth the Touchſtone, to enquire into the value of things before we receive them, that counterfeit coin may not claim the ſame priviledge with what is inſtamp'd with <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Image, nor an enterance opened for the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> riding in a <hi>Kirk,</hi> born on the backs of thoſe that know not what
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100880:7"/>
they carry: that they may bring Popery in triumph to us, like the <hi>Grecians</hi> lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the belly of that Wooden and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible Horſe, that entred <hi>Troy</hi> and ſacked the City, and ſo gain'd that by an eaſie ſtrategem, which ten years ſiege could not effect. For theſe and ſuch like reaſons (if men will now hearken to any) I have choſen this Subject to Diſcourſe on, that, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, we may ſeparate the chaff from the wheat; diſtinguiſh betwixt the Doctrines of Apoſtles, and thoſe of Devils, and mark out the Spirit of Antichriſt, that it may be known from that of our Saviour, that names may no longer confound things, nor Satan be received by any of us, though he <hi>transforms himſelf into an Angel of light</hi>; leſt we miſtake that for <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> in his Mantle, which only the Witch of <hi>Endor</hi> raiſes. And therefore <hi>let us not believe every Spirit, but try the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits whether they are of God, becauſe many falſe Prophets are gone into the world.</hi> And from theſe words, I ſhall raiſe my Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>In this Epiſtle, S. <hi>John</hi> endeavours to confirm Chriſtians in the profeſſion and practice of the Chriſtian Religion,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100880:8"/>
notwithſtanding all Objections to the contrary; and therfore gives them ſufficient caution to beware (1.) Of ſuch Hereſies as deſtroy the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſuch as interfer'd with the great Doctrines and Authority of the <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>; ſuch as under ſome great pretences of purity, and preciſeneſs, might intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Factions and Schiſms, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve that ſtrict love and union which ought to be among the Profeſſors of the Goſpel: Theſe things ſome were prone unto in the firſt and early times of Chriſtianity: As ſoon as the Church had put forth leaves, the <hi>Caterpillars</hi> were ready to devour them: (2.) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Church of Chriſt was plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the midſt of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Heathen Idolatry; and a Sect was now ſprung up in the world that, under the names of Chriſtians, had provided Principles which in times of danger might equally ſuit with both, or either, and ſo could ſhelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from one ſtorm, and raiſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if the wind blew from either quarter: The Apoſtle therefore bids men <hi>to beware of Idolatry,</hi> this being a plain renunciation of their Religion, as Hereſie would both maim and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100880:8"/>
wound it: <hi>Little children</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>keep your ſelves from Idols:</hi> and what he cloſes his Epiſtle with, is, what we all cloſe our prayers with: And that we may be alſo delivered from the inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations or Society of both theſe ſorts, let all the people ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the conſideration of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of our Apoſtle, we may plainly ſee how ſuitable this whole Epiſtle is to the preſent humours and diſtractions among us, and how ſoon, were the advice imbraced, it would cure us of thoſe languiſhing diſtempers, under which we ſeem to faint and die: The extremities of diſeaſe vex and torture us, and no ſooner have we got off a cold fit, which makes us almoſt ſhake and ſhiver into aſhes, but the hot one comes on, which fires and almoſt is ready to conſume us; Nay, a ſtrange mixture of both encounter us, rather than we ſhall recover and live, and thoſe things which the vigour and ſtrength of our conſtitution is able to baffle whilſt ſeparate and apart, being conjoined, create a new diſeaſe, which troubles the Phyſician, and puts him to the utmoſt of his skill; though I hope it will never be able to baffle him,

or leave us to be a prey to vermine, or the great diſeaſe and peſt of men: Let us follow the rules of this Apoſtle, that what ever injuries our bodies may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer (which in too many are Martyrs already by the great fears and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties of their minds) our ſouls may be ſafe and ſecure, <hi>and kept unblameable to the coming of the Lord Jeſus:</hi> Let us be united in our common profeſſion, not ſtaggered with the high pretences of others; nor let us yet relax our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence from the diſcourſes of any that will at all adventures be ſecure among our ſelves; But whatever notions of infallibility on the one hand, or preſent and particular inſpiration on the other, ſhall be preſented to us, to debauch us from our Principles; Let us well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine before we believe; receive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may contradict natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or what is ſuperadded in the word of God, that publick and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared revelation, to which there need no additions to make the man of God <hi>wiſe unto ſalvation</hi>: But let us fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Apoſtles advice, <hi>and try the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits whether they are of God, becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny falſe Prophets are gone out into the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:100880:9"/>By the word <hi>Spirit,</hi> here is plainly meant any one that under a pretence of Inſpiration or aſſiſtance from the Spirit, publiſhes any new<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Doctrine to the world, in the age of the Goſpel, and ſo includes both Papiſts and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts; The one tying the Spirit to the Chair of the Pope, the other to their own Dreams and Phancies: And this interpretation, as it is generally aſſented to, is plain and open to every man that will either conſider the ſcope of the Epiſtle, or the reaſon of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Apoſtle, why we ſhould <hi>not believe every Spirit, becauſe many falſe Prophets are come forth into the world</hi>; and therefore we are to examine the Doctrines, which any pretender to the Spirit teaches, <hi>leſt we are led by the authority of any into ſnares, that may cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate and deſtroy our ſouls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now although this caution of Saint <hi>John,</hi> primarily relates to the <hi>Gnoſtick</hi> defection; yet it is a direction to all Ages, and may guard us from all the pretenſions of men that, under a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous authority from the <hi>Spirit of truth,</hi> vent falſe Doctrines to the World, in any period of the Chriſtian Religion; Becauſe both the Duty and the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

to inforce it will be of a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual concernment, as long as <hi>falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets come forth into the world.</hi> Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> are moſt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately reflected on, as being the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, ſo early appearing in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world, to defeat this Religion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a denomination from it, boaſting ſome extraordinary knowledge, when they were men both ignorant and vile; we muſt enquire into the particular reaſon, why the Apoſtle in this place cautions men to beware of theſe, whoſe faults were ſo ſcandalous, that they ſeem manifeſt to all: The reaſon of this (next to that which is more general, the proneneſs of men to any error that may gratifie themſelves, and become either their ſecurity or pleaſure) is the ſame, why the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall neither be forgiven in this world, nor in the world to come; becauſe the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> plainly deſtroyed the Goſpel, although by a different Argument from the former: The former againſt whom that ſevere, though deſerved, Sentence was pronounced, invalidated all our Saviours Miracles, which prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Doctrine to be Divine, and himſelf the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſent from God, by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100880:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
attributing them to the power of the Devil; but the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> did in effect the ſame thing, by retaining, upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, the Ceremonies of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which our Saviour had aboliſhed, if he were owned as a perſon ſent from God to void the old Law, and eſtabliſh a new: So that thoſe who embraced what he came to vacate, in effect denied him to be come in the fleſh; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroyed the obligation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, by renouncing the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> whoſe authority eſtabliſhed this new Law as a Rule to the World: Nay, by this rejection of the Son, they diſowned the Father, who, <hi>by a voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and giving him <hi>power to work Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi> gave a teſtimony to his Perſon and his Doctrine: And therefore our Apoſtle (reflecting upon theſe men) ſaies; <hi>Who is a liar, but he that denieth that Jeſus is the Chriſt? He is Antichriſt that denieth the Father and the Son: whoſo denieth the Son, the ſame hath not the Father, but he that acknowledgeth the Son, the ſame hath the Father alſo,</hi> (1 John. 2 <hi>Chap.</hi> 22.23.)

               <p>HAving thus given an account of part of this Epiſtle of S. <hi>John,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with thoſe, of whom the Apoſtle cautions men to beware; I ſhall far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explain and illuſtrate the words, to render them yet more uſeful to our ſelves by conſidering in them, (1.) A Caution, (2.) An Exhortation, (3.) The reaſon of both. The Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is; <hi>Not to believe every Spirit:</hi> The Exhortation, <hi>To try the Spirits, whether they are of God:</hi> The Reaſon both of this Caution and Exhortation is, <hi>becauſe many falſe Prophets are gone out into the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I begin with the Apoſtles Caution: <hi>Beloved, believe not every Spirit</hi>; If all that men utter pretending to be inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, were without any ſevere conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to be entertain'd, and what they deliver, were to be believ'd, there would no more need the Apoſtles caution than our own care: But when
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100880:12"/>
we live in an Age, in which Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Doctrines are delivered, that too plainly contradict each other; ſome of which are impious and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable; others at firſt audit, fooliſh, and ridiculous; and a third ſort, that tend to diſturbance and ruine, waſting Property, making our Kingdoms large <hi>Aceldama</hi>'s, and our Cities the places of dead mens ſculls, and are apparent enemies to human Society: When, under the pretence of a Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Doctrines of purity, propoſals to advance the Scepter of Chriſts Kingdom, Principles ſhall be inſinuated, that if purſued, with that furious zeal, which they require, will effectually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thoſe things indeed, which men endeavour to maintain in words; If our bleſſed Saviour may thus be fought under his own Banner, the cauſe of God cover abominations, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be acted for the glory of our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, Blaſphemy be ſpoken by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Spirit, and the method to render Princes glorious, ſhall be by ſtabbing, or beheading: If the moſt horrid wickedneſs ſhall be palliated under the cloke of Religion, a new Commandment ſhall be pretended for
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100880:12"/>
breach of the old, and the Moral Law ſhall daily be violated by inſpiration: If men under pretenſions to the guidance of that Spirit which inſpired the firſt deliverers of the Goſpel, to be a Rule to ſucceeding Ages and Generations, ſhall hang out new lights to the world, that take away all the glory of the old, and preach to us another Goſpel, bearing their Chriſt only pictured on their Standards and Banners, and their Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to us on the points of Swords: Nay, when the Spirit, in the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel, neither preſcribed nor uſed ſuch methods, but quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, thoſe of faith, and patience, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and ſelf-denial, which did not interfere with the Government of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but made men actively, or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, to obey: And when the ſame Spirit has expreſly declared, <hi>that in the latter times there would be ſuch a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away from the faith,</hi> that men would ſo far depart from the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rules of the Goſpel, <hi>as to give heed to ſeducing Spirits, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Devils,</hi> (1 Tim. 4.1.): Nay when the great Lord and Authour of our Religion has acquainted the world, <hi>that many falſe Prophets ſhould ariſe,</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:100880:13"/>
with ſuch earneſt pretences, and ſtrong deluſions, <hi>that ſhould almoſt ſhake the very Elect,</hi> (thoſe whom he had choſen to put his Name and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter upon) with, <hi>Lo here is Chriſt, or lo there</hi>; exalting ſeveral, though falſe <hi>Meſſiahs</hi>: It will become us to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any new pretenſions beyond the rule we have already learned, and not to receive Opinions at adventure, but to make a more ſtrict, and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, enquiry, <hi>and not to believe every Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that (1.) Becauſe we have already entertained a ſtanding Rule of Faith and Manners, by which all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ought to be directed to the final period and conſummation of Ages: And though this great and Characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtical Principle of Proteſtants, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted both by the Papiſts and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts, whilſt the former equal their Traditions with the Scriptures, and the latter their own fancies and dreams; both upon occaſion, beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch ignominious titles on the Bible, that they would think it uncivil if they ſhould be given to any of their own writings: Yet S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>that the Scriptures are able to make us wiſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100880:13"/>
unto Salvation</hi>; and being given by inſpiration from God, cannot be falſe without ſuppoſing him a liar: Nay, the Apoſtle goes on in their commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>that they are profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in righteouſneſs, that the man of God</hi> (much more the people) <hi>may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, throughly furniſhed unto all good works,</hi> (2 Tim. 3.15, 16, 17.). The deſign of that Goſpel which we have embraced, ſufficiently declares it to be a full and compleat rule of life; that, which if followed, brings peace and welfare to us here; and eternal happineſs in that life which is to come: For it teaches us <hi>to deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and godly in the world; and to look for a bleſſed hope and immortality</hi>; for which the former way of living prepares us: (<hi>Titus</hi> 2.11, 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>). Nay, ſo perfect and compleat is this rule, and ſo deſigned to direct us to the end of the world, that the Apoſtle denounces a Curſe againſt any that teach another Goſpel, or Rule of life, different from, or contradictory to, this; <hi>though an Angel from Heaven</hi> ſhould prove to be the deliverer: And
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100880:14"/>
repeats it twice in the ſame Chapter, that it may be ſufficiently declared, and ſtand as a memorial to all Ages: (<hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8, 9.). And Saint <hi>John,</hi> in the cloſe of his <hi>Revelations,</hi> ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproves all new pretenſions, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the world, that, if any man ſhall make additions to this, which was compleat before, God ſhall add unto him the Plagues that are threatned in it: <hi>And if any ſhall take away from it, his part ſhall be taken out of the book of life,</hi> (Rev. 22.18, 19.). The perfection of the Scriptures is a point which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants have alwaies held, as that which, as it is moſt true, ſo it is their moſt ſure defence againſt all the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of <hi>Rome,</hi> and others: And this is what the Ancient Fathers tried Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines by of old, and reprov'd Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, by what was written: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, according to the Education or diſpoſition of thoſe that oppoſed them, they wanted not, but made uſe of, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments from Reaſon and Philoſophy, and the natural Religion of mankind. Now the Scripture being a ſafe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a true, Rule; and true becauſe given to us by Authority from God, who gave ſufficient teſtimony to it, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100880:14"/>
and encouraging the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of it; and farther, it is atteſted <hi>by ſigns, and wonders, and divers Miracles</hi>: And a ſafe rule it is, becauſe it has all that tends to the perfection of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the ſaving of our ſouls, and is compleat in the delivery of all the <hi>Articles of the Chriſtian Faith,</hi> and all the neceſſary Rules of life; And is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be ſtanding and perpetual; as well to aboliſh the old Law to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as to open a door of hope to the <hi>Gentiles</hi>; and to obviate all the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of either: Nay, it ſufficiently becomes its own interpreter, when men are aſſiſted by thoſe ordinary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which Education, and the grace of God gives them; If they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult their Guides, diligently compare one place with another, and are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and modeſt, in their enquiries: <hi>How then can we believe every Spirit?</hi> Raſhly receiving Opinions at adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſince this ſtanding Rule may be contradicted by them; or oppoſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſeeming ſhelter of its own; whilſt men wreſt it to others ruine, as well as to their own deſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:100880:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Secondly, To believe every Spirit,</hi> is to unman our ſelves, render us ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and expoſe us to the contempt and ſcorn of all conſidering men in the world. For ſince, not only S. <hi>John,</hi> but continual experience aſſures us, that there are <hi>falſe Prophets in the world,</hi> and that they vent contrary Doctrines to thoſe that are true; To attempt to <hi>believe every Spirit,</hi> is to attempt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities; And this is not only fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, but unreaſonable; ſince no man can poſſibly believe contradictory O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions to be, at the ſame time, true. But ſuppoſe they are received ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively to one another: Yet it argues great levity and inconſtancy in men, <hi>to be carried about with every wind of Doctrine</hi>; want of judgment to be ſo eaſily perſuaded; and that they were careleſs in their firſt choice, who are ſo readily prevailed upon for a ſecond: That they never were ſetled upon the old foundation, who, on all occaſions, remove to a new; and were not true to their firſt Love, who cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant upon the ſight of another, but alter their affections upon every view of a new face, and are pleaſed with all the parts of variety. Now, theſe are
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100880:15"/>
blemiſhes in the minds of men; mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table tempers, without any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reaſon, being blots, and a diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to mankind, whoſe ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſouls give them the priviledge of thinking, and enable, and admoniſh, them to conſider well before they chuſe: And when thus they have, by argument and judgment, made their choice; They are not to be eaſily mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from it: Unleſs upon as wiſe, and deliberate thoughts, and ſtronger rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons than thoſe by which they yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the truth of the firſt Opinion, they remove from it, and chuſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He that is unſetled in his mind, or no longer fix'd than another object is preſented, creates ſuch diſturbances to himſelf, that he makes his life trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom and tragical, and is much to be pitied, (if his unquietneſs will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to ſtay at home, and not make others ſhare with him) and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by all thoſe who know the ſweetneſs of ſettlement and reſolution; that have conſidered what they can, upon fitting circumſtances, part with; And what they are reſolved to adhere to with all the hazards of their lives, and Fortunes. Alas! the wavering
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100880:16"/>
man has no peace; though, for his own reputation, he may often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it: But, as S. <hi>James</hi> ſaies, <hi>he is like a wave of the Sea, driven with the wind, and toſs'd,</hi> (Jam. 1.6.). Like a diſeaſed, ſick man upon his Bed, he tumbles about from place to place, and carries always a Wind-mill in his head, which grinds him according as the wind veers, and turns; He neglects his Calling (if he has any); Or, if he has none, better employments, to drive with a ſtrange Phanatic fury a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the world, ready to overturn all he meets with, to enquire concerning news, and projects, that he may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace all, and be true to neither: And ſo the man renders himſelf unfit to be either a friend or a Chriſtian, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a fool by thoſe methods by which he would yet be accounted wiſe. But he that has well meaſured his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples by the rule of Gods word, and has diſtinguiſhed betwixt what is fundamental, and what is circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial; who has bound his life to a ſtake, dyed daily in his own thoughts, and reſolved well, when it is Religious to ſuffer decently; How far he is able, upon juſt occaſion, to comply with
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100880:16"/>
the commands of men veſted in lawful Authority; and where the points and limits are, beyond which he muſt not ſtep a foot; But, if he periſh, he will periſh there, that ſo he may not eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally periſh: This man ſtands unmov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at tempeſts and ſtorms, does his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty according to his ſtation, and the juſt commands of his lawful Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours: And, if the Heavens fall, juſtice ſhall alwayes be done by him: He can be, otherwiſe than his place requires, unconcerned at ſeeming tempeſts that threaten, or that thunder which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins the ſtorm: He knows when his life, or eſtate, or liberty, muſt be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed; when by lawful Authority, willingly; and when by unlawful, it muſt be by force taken: And, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore goes on cheerfully, and faithfully, as far as he can, on the ſide of Law, and juſt Authority, putting it in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; and ſtops when an higher Rule will permit him to go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And certainly, as this prevents all anticipation of evil, ſo is it ſuch a ſteady and well conſidered reſolution, that is more manly and rational than to be driven like the Clouds in the Air, and to be alwayes like the Sea in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100880:17"/>
ſometimes forward, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times backward, without any fixed reſt or quiet; Or, by being ſo ready to <hi>believe every Spirit,</hi> to entertain none kindly as we ought.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We muſt not <hi>believe every Spirit</hi>; becauſe, if we give our ſelves too great a liberty, it will be difficult, indeed impoſſible, to diſcern thoſe that are true from the falſe. If we once get into the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> we may tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel forty years there, and neither know when we are in, or out of the way, and wander about, God knows whither: We may murmure and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, and blame each other, whilſt the fault will yet remain in our ſelves, and our very travail becomes our pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, till at laſt we die and periſh in a Wilderneſs, which becomes the enterance to greater darkneſs. Alas! the Chriſtian Religion (though much debauched by the corrupt intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and diſgraced by the vicious lives, of men:) is not now to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to the world; nor are its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords ſo hidden or loſt, that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of it are no where to be found; nor are men, yet, ſo blockiſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, that they cannot read, ſo as
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100880:17"/>
to underſtand them: If men were ſo blind, thoſe that are as blind might lead them into the ditch. But the principles of Chriſtianity (beſides what was revealed in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) are now above ſixteen hundred years ſtanding, and have been handed down, from age to age, with their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal records: And therefore this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion becomes matter of fact, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention: And all the queſtion muſt now be, What was at firſt delivered? The wiſe and grave reaſon of men, muſt not controll the Wiſdom of God, nor make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing of that which God ſent his Son to declare to the World, and has been conveyed to us, with as great a certainty, as any thing antecedent to the time we live in. We are not, now, by diſcourſe or inſpiration to make to our ſelves another Goſpel, under the notion or pretence of the old: This is not a thing ſubject to the Maxims of every ſquirting, and half-witted, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher; nor to be moulded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the intrigues and deſigns of a ſubtle and projecting Stateſman: It is not to be ſpued out of the mouth of the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> nor cunningly to be
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100880:18"/>
fleered out of the Works of <hi>Plato,</hi> nor blended with any Doctrines of <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> that may prepare men for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence to their vice, or perſwade them to disbelieve ſome of the greateſt and moſt ſubſtantial points of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. Our Religion is, now, too old to be made new: nor muſt we model that, which has run through ſo many Ages, by any tricks or devices of our own; nor muſt it be ſervant to any mens ambition; as if their ſecular inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt or opinion were to be their guide; or phancy, putting on the name and garb of conſcience, were to be a Rule for ſuch as call themſelves Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony</hi> (ſayes the Prophet), <hi>if any ſpeak not according to this rule, it is becauſe they have no light in them:</hi> (Iſa. 8.20.). <hi>And we have a more ſure word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi> (ſayes S. <hi>Peter, Epiſt.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 19.). <hi>whereunto you do well, that ye take heed, as unto a light that ſhineth in a dark place.</hi> If we forſake therefore the tryal of the Doctrines and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of men by the Scriptures, (which rightly underſtood, are our only ſafe Rule) we have no way to diſtinguiſh a bold pretender, from him
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100880:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
who is inſpired from above; If ſuch perſons were now to be expected, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Canon of Scripture, the Rule for mens lives, have been ſo long ago com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated. For by inclining to believe any new revelation beyond the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, we ſuppoſe that an inſufficient Rule: (the ſufficiency of which true, <hi>Engliſh,</hi> Church Proteſtants have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes defended with ſucceſs): And, if the revelation be contrary unto it, it makes that Spirit that dictated the firſt, a lyar, if the latter be received and ſuppoſed true. But grant what men, of ſuch an eaſie belief, and ſuch ſpeedy reſolutions, that admit of as ſpeedy changes, would, without any proof, have yielded to them: Yet I would fain know, how men, in their circumſtances, are able any way to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie themſelves concerning the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which they pretend to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired in, and thereby authorized to deliver unto others: I am afraid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence will be their only argument to recommend it to others, and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, intereſt, and a ſtrong preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or what is worſe, Atheiſm and Knavery, to themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:100880:19"/>For (1.) ſuppoſing the Spirit of God in its Dictates unto men alwayes uniform and conſiſtent with it ſelf, how can there be different inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to preſcribe various Rules oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to each other at the ſame time for men to guide their belief and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations? The Apoſtle tells us, that as there is but <hi>one God,</hi> and <hi>one Lord,</hi> with undoubted authority over the whole World; ſo there is but <hi>one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> to influence the minds of men, <hi>one Baptiſm</hi> that enters them into the Church of Chriſt, and but <hi>one Faith</hi> to be embraced by them; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Church</hi> is but <hi>one Body; (Eph.</hi> 4.4, 5, 6.). How then can we reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably admit the pretence of any mans inſpiration, that avers he ſpeaks from the Dictates of the Spirit, which is within him, to publiſh any Rules of Religion different from what we have received before? And if ſuch a preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der means only his own Spirit, the ſoul which acts within the body, we can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand no more than his judgement and opinion: Though phraſes by ſuch canting, are rendered equivocal, to ſtartle the infirm; but are foreign to our purpoſe, when reflected on by
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100880:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
conſidering men: We well know, that the deſign of Chriſtianity, was to unite the World under one profeſſion, and in religious affairs, to ſubject it to the ſame rules of life: How then can any with Religion or modeſty, pretend another inſpiration for new directions, when the former, if they were ever true, are ſufficiently in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament declared to be perpetual, and obligatory till Chriſts coming to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when he ſhall paſs ſentence upon the whole World, and deliver us into our everlaſting ſtates, no leſs than his Mediatory Kingdom back un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Father? Theſe are ſuch incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent things, that none but mad men can now expect any inſpirations, to deliver new Doctrines to the World.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) I would fain learn of any bold man, that publiſhes, under a pretence of inſpiration, new Doctrines different from the old, how he knows himſelf to be inſpired? We find thoſe that were formerly ſo (beſides ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain token to themſelves, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we, nor our pretenders, can now give a certain account of, though we may ſome probable conjectures) could
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100880:20"/>
work Miracles for the ſettlement of belief both in themſelves and others: But no ſuch things appear now; though lying wonders are publiſhed to the World, carrying only the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe that invent the ſtory, or others that are hired to ſacrifice the truth to the confidence of an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor; and therefore one would think, ſuch things as theſe, ſhould, at the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, only deceive the ſimple, whilſt they that enſnare them, having other deſigns, beyond their reach, vent what they do not believe themſelves, that they may accompliſh their own carnal ends, by the religious eaſineſs and ſimplicity of others: For, upon the view of thoſe various Sects, viſible ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abroad, or among our ſelves, that any way pretend to be inſpired to what they deliver to others; we find them publiſhing, by this authority, doctrines to be believed, and Rules of life, quite different<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nay, oppoſite to one another; and purſue each other according to the advantages they receive, with a greater eagerneſs, and hotter perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than we at any time oppoſe them all: And if the Holy Spirit be but one, (as yet I hope I may without much
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100880:20"/>
aſſuming or confidence affirm he is) if it be alwayes conſiſtent with it ſelf, there can be but one inſpiration at one time true, and the reſt that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend differently from this, make, at once, themſelves, and God a Liar; whilſt they ſuppoſe him to contradict himſelf, and they become the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhers of ſuch contradictions. Beſides, if the Spirit, theſe wild men pretend to, does inform their minds of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples they deliver by an immediate illumination, or impulſe upon their ſpirits; either they feel the ſtroke made upon them by this inviſible power, ſo that they can tell the time (as the Prophets of old) when the Word of the Lord comes to them; or elſe they are raiſed by degrees into a preſumption, that they have this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which thus forces them to declare new Doctrines to the World: If they pretend to know when the ſtroke and impulſe is made; why does not one immediately of a Fiſherman become an Apoſtle without any ſtudy, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer gradual practice? without being bred in the Schools of the Jeſuits; or by long hearing the Cant, at home, by which he is educated and trained to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100880:21"/>
it; why does he not on a ſudden riſe up and publiſh ſuch conſiſtent Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, as may be ſuitable to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thoſe whom he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade to embrace them; or at leaſt, not thwarting and contradicting the natural Religion of mankind? But ſince we find this impoſſible among them; or the utmoſt of their skill, to be by ſome mechanick operation, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, by an unaccountable influence from the Prince of the Air: Why ſhould any be ſtartled at, or give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to new Apoſtles, when our Rules are compleated by thoſe, that were commiſſioned of old? If we ſearch into the bottom of theſe things, we ſhall find them, either voluntary Cheats, when thoſe that own them, make them ſubſervient to bad deſigns; or ſuch, as men, being deceived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by a bad conſtitution, a corrupt education, or a ſuggeſtion from the Devil under the form of an Angel of Light, endeavour, either through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or ſubtilty, to impoſe upon eaſie believers.</p>
               <p>For, (1.) There is no promiſe for ſuch immediate inſpirations to dictate new Rules of life, made to any, but to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100880:21"/>
Apoſtolical men in the firſt Age of the Goſpel, who were to deliver what was to be the ſtanding Law to all ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Generations: And therefore there is no ground of hope for ſuch things as theſe, in the preſent Age wherein we live: Becauſe inſpiration being an immediate influence from God himſelf, his Will enlarges or reſtrains this power to us; and whenever men expect with reaſon any thing from him, it muſt be grounded upon a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, on which we may hope and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe all Gods Promiſes are as certain as his Truth, and that equally certain with his Being: There being, therefore, no promiſe of this made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Age and Lives of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, as no men can now rationally expect any inſpiration to confirm their pretenſions, ſo neither can others with ſobriety believe them. (2.) Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to preſcribe new Rules to the World are ſo needleſs after a compleat Law is already given that is to be ſo laſting and perpetual as the Goſpel, that were they now to be found amongſt men; if they ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it, they would aboliſh and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Goſpel: But if the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100880:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are inſpired only to the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame truths revealed there, this ſecond inſpiration will appear needleſs, and ſo tax the wiſdom of God, to do ſo great and extraordinary a thing to no purpoſe; becauſe there are the ſame rules already reveal'd, written down in the firſt age, and by the ſpecial providence of Almighty God (notwithſtanding the diligent and furious attempts of the powers of the Earth to interrupt the conveyance) handed down from age to age, and yet remaining publick and open amongſt our ſelves, in our own language, that all may read and underſtand: The continuance of men diſtinct from the multitude, who by a different manner of living and Education, are enabled, and bound by a ſpecial duty, to read, and interpret theſe Scriptures to the people, renders a new inſpiration uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to deliver theſe things to the world, which art and human induſtry can do: God might, indeed, if he had ſo pleaſed, have continued his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Rules of life, by writing them daily in every mans breaſt, and inſpiring every individual amongſt us; But if he had done ſo at firſt, there had
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100880:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
been no need of the Twelve Apoſtles, nor our Saviours own preaching to the world, but only to be born and die, and riſe again: and if it were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards continued, it would render preaching, and reading a written word uſeleſs, eaſe us of much pains and toil; and all our inſpired and blown up men of giving themſelves or others the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to come to preach or to hear them at a Conventicle. And ſo inſpired men compendiouſly preach away their own Office: Yet our Saviour conſtituted a ſtanding Miniſtry, whom he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>to be with to the end of the world,</hi> (Mat. 28.18, 19.). And S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us that when our bleſſed Lord aſcended up on high, he conſtituted in his ſtead, to continue his Office of teaching, and preſiding over, his Church, ſome <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, ſome Paſtors and Teachers</hi>; ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral orders and degrees of men ſuitable to Ages, and various Imployments, to preſerve the Inſtitutions, Doctrines, and order of the Goſpel; <hi>for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of the Saints; for the work of the Miniſtry; for the edifying of the body of Chriſt</hi>; To remain ſo long till all that ſhould be gathered out of the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100880:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ages and generations of men, might <hi>come in the unity of the faith, and the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the fulneſs of Chriſt,</hi> (Epheſ. 4<hi>th.</hi> from the 8<hi>th.</hi> to the 13<hi>th.</hi> Verſe:). Now the eſtabliſhment of ſuch a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miniſtry throughout the ages of the Chriſtian Church, which is to endure until the Judgement of the Great day, ſufficiently baffles all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of any particular and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued inſpirations, to effect the ſame which the Miniſtry aſſiſted by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Rule and ordinary conduct of Gods Holy Spirit can well accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh; The conſtitution of the one is ſo oppoſite to, and inconſiſtent with the other, that none but madmen can believe both; and none but thoſe that are diſeaſed and Lunatick, can expect inſpiration to ſuch purpoſes, that ever conſidered the conſtitutions of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, it evacuating all the Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the Goſpel. (3.) Suppoſe there were ſuch an impulſe or inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to be expected; Yet how ſhould thoſe, who are to be guided by what they that pretend to it deliver, know that they are really inſpired, who ſo
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100880:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
confidently conduct and lead the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; ſince they do no real Miracles, nor uſe ſuch convincing arguments, either from the nature of thoſe Principles they propound unto the world, their coherence with any thing already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd, their agreeableneſs to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, or the welfare of men, to perſuade any reaſonably to embrace them: If it be pretended that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration it ſelf is a ſufficient authority to him that delivers Principles to the world, and reaſon enough for any to embrace them; Yet, however, the inſpiration muſt ſtill be proved, as it has alwayes been, by Miracles; And thoſe not falſe, but real: Becauſe, otherwiſe, every one, that has confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and wickedneſs enough to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to an impulſe and Call from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, may impoſe what he pleaſes on the world, and they muſt, without examination, believe it: This indeed would be a ready way to render the reaſon of men uſeleſs, and degrade them into the ſilly nature of a Beaſt, that, being bridled and ſadled, is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed which way ſoever the rider pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: Nay, it would be an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and new method; as miraculous,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100880:24"/>
nay more than the pretenders inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, to make the parts of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction both true, if all thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that they are inſpired are to be believed: For nothing can be more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to us than that various Sects, oppoſite to one another, diſtant to a total ſeparation, pretend all to be thus inſpired; And if what upon this they preſume to deliver, is to be received by thoſe to whom the meſſage is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected; And they pretend it is directed unto all: How can we, ſince their confidence is equal, know which to adhere to, ſince all come by the ſame authority; And it is impoſſible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the opinions of all, becauſe they contradict one another: 'Tis true, we find ſome men among us that have run through all the ſigns of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> and their want of conſtancy and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, not being directed to the <hi>Pole,</hi> has cauſed them to tremble and ſhake like a Needle through all the points of the Compaſs; Yet this has been by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; not at once, but by ſucceſſion: But in the caſe we have now in hand, many pretend to have things reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that yet thwart and encounter one another, and all at the ſame time: To
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100880:24"/>
embrace, at once, theſe ſeveral propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, is plainly impoſſible; and if we conſider, to make our choice, we are either apparently obſtinate and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, when all come with the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; or elſe we openly forſake the Argument of Inſpiration; and ſtand, and examine theſe Doctrines by a rule; <hi>and inſtead of believing every Spirit,</hi> we <hi>try them.</hi> But if men will, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe plain and palpable ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities, preſume ſtill to thruſt ſuch wild pretenſions upon the world, and the proof of their Doctrines ſhall be by confidence, not argument; I would willingly have them to conſider<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well as our ſelves, what their pretended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration means, and what that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe uſually effects upon their own minds; that makes them ſo confident that they are inſpired from above? Can it be ſuppoſed (or do they feel in themſelves) any thing more than their own melancholy, or thoughts brood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hatch an Opinion? Do they find any more than their perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions heightned, and their aſſurance, of what they were before willing to believe, bold and ſtrong, and thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming them with a zeal to maintain
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100880:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
what inordinate thoughts have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd ſtrong reſolutions to propagate in the world? If it be ſo, (as certainly it is) every man who is thus raiſed, will have the ſame authority with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; and oppoſite opinions (which is yet impoſſible) muſt at once be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by men, becauſe the authority, upon which their certainty is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is felt by all, though underſtood by neither: And to others there ſeems the ſame confidence and aſſurance in the teachers of theſe different Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Our own reaſon therefore, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an inſpiration, will readily teach us that, ſince the Holy Spirit of God (to an inſpiration from which all theſe ſeveral men pretend) is but one, and what it delivers, alwayes conſiſtent; theſe men cannot be inſpired: But they take their dreams for a converſe with Spirits, their melancholy phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies for inſpirations, the diſeaſes of their bodies for the accompliſhments of their minds, and their own thoughts to be Revelations: And, in ſhort, only think themſelves awaked when they are indeed aſleep. Nay, we may far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther raiſe our diſtruſt and boldneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards theſe men; Becauſe we know that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100880:25"/>
confidence, aſſurance, and real belief of what has entred into the minds of men, receive degrees of acceſſion and ſtrength, as well by thought, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and argument, as by any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe that can be imagined; Nay, many times, ſubtility, pride, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and wilfulneſs, will maintain a thing with as great eagerneſs and zeal, as if men had been really inſpired. The Devil can do much to heighten mens perſuaſions; and they may do much to heighten their own; and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, that men conjecture to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at a compleat demonſtration of a point, will make them as tenacious of an opinion (eſpecially where they may appear ſingular) as any impulſe or inſpiration. Now in the midſt of ſuch perplexing cauſes, that are able to produce the ſame effect, it will be difficult, if not impoſſible, for men, that adhere not to a Rule of trial, to come to a particular and exact determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and to ſatisfie either others or themſelves to what cauſe they may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute the effect.</p>
               <p>If they pretend to be able to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betwixt a good and a bad cauſe, where the effect yet ſeems to be the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100880:26"/>
ſame: Or to know the cauſe by the different impreſſions, variety of impulſes make upon their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, by which an object is conveyed to their underſtandings; and by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct method, by which the images of things become figured in the brain: This can be no conviction to others, until it is explained; Nor any to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, unleſs they certainly know, and underſtand it: Which, if they do, they are as well able to expreſs this, as they are the propoſition which, as they pretend, is revealed to them: But I fear this attempt will be in vain: Becauſe I cannot find upon ſtrict con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and retirement, but that the motions of the Spirits muſt be always alike; and the ſame percuſſions upon, and convulſions in, the nerves, to cauſe the ſoul to underſtand and believe; whether it be truth, or falſhood that is repreſented, if it be received under the notion of truth; And if the object ſeems to be true, it makes a like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion as if it were ſo: Therefore it is impoſſible for the Enthuſiaſt to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh an inſpiration from God, from a ſuggeſtion by the Devil, if he forſakes th<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100880:26"/>
of good and evil. Therefore we ſee how unreaſonable it is either to be ſtartled with the vain pretences of men, or to give credit <hi>to every Spirit</hi>; ſince, upon ſuch grounds, the <hi>Devil</hi> may be entertained <hi>for an Angel of light,</hi> and the diſcoveries we make, may as well be by the flames of Hell, as by beams darted from the <hi>Sun</hi> in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament.</p>

               <p>NOw from the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> precedent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, upon the caution of the Apoſtle, I inferr (1.) The unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs of ſuch men, and their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable ſtate, who ſhutting their eyes againſt the Sun, create a perpetual night to themſelves, and love to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in darkneſs and error, by being of ſuch unſteady tempers, ſuch eaſie and unmanly reſolutions; ſhifting Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Opinions at every turn, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding every Apparition to be an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of Light, and the dreams of men to be inſpirations; And though prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of various ſhapes and faces are preſented by men with the ſame confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and pretence of inſpiration: yet too many are ſo inconſiderate and eaſie, as to admit all by a continued ſucceſſion, and live altogether in a circle, as if they were fix'd like one of the Philoſophers intelligences in an Orb, turning it round, and riding
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100880:27"/>
themſelves about with it: Or rather chained by ſome Magical charm, that they are condemned to run about the circle, and yet are never able to ſtand ſtill long enough to diſentangle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And what a diſmal ſtate of life is this, never to poſſeſs reſt and quiet? How pitiable is the condition of a man, that has his mind alwayes toſs'd and ruffled? who has got ſuch a paralytical diſtemper, as keeps his head alwayes jogging; who entertains no principles long, and yet Religion is his perpetual burden: And well may it be ſo to him, who loads himſelf with ſuch variety. Theſe men put a veil over their own eyes, and blindfold themſelves, that they may either be led by others, or ſtumble on they know not whither: Theſe diſcern not truth from falſhood, nor make any difference betwixt opinion and demonſtration; who every day are intangled in the midſt of ſnares and abſurdity, and wander about in a wild wilderneſs, when they think they are travelling through an inhabited Countrey: They are like Fowls flying in the air, who are hamper'd in Nets which others have placed on Poles to catch them,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100880:28"/>
when they think they are mounted above hazard and danger. 'Tis a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Judgement, when God, that gave men ſouls to diſcern, ſhall, for their own wilful blindneſs, deliver them up to the power of deluſion to believe a lye; eſpecially when we ſhall reflect upon what the Apoſtle informs us will be the conſequence: <hi>That they may be damned who believe not the truth:</hi> (2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.11.). We find that this muſt naturally become the effect of ſuch a wild principle: And the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience which we have of the irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities and crimes of ſuch perſons ſufficiently informs us, that their ways in this world lead down to the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Death, and in the other to the Vaults of Hell: Unleſs the greateſt Villanies may be conſecrated by ſuch hallowed pretences, and wickedneſs may change its nature, by adding the higheſt degree to it, when men make God the Author of it: Then indeed the Government of Chriſt will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be inconſiſtent with that of our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign; the <hi>Kirk</hi> may beat the Throne in pieces, and men may ſnatch away the Kings Crown to cover their own heads withal: And it may be, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100880:28"/>
a while, an intrenchment on the Triple Crown, to be the Sovereign of three Kingdoms. The diſmal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of ſuch an unreaſonable and looſe opinion, we have no cauſe yet to forget: Or, if they had eſcaped our memories, and were buried in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion, the Authors of them, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid they ſhould remain hid, will cauſe them to revive by freſh inſtances, that Charity it ſelf may no longer cover them; but their repeated crimes may at once renew and preſerve their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. God has permitted the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to theſe new inſpirations, at once almoſt to make a plain diſcovery of themſelves; and yet he ſtrengthens the hands of Authority to obviate the deſigns of both; and has cauſed the Religion of his own Church, taking its meaſures by the rules of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, to ſhine when it was almoſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a Cloud; Lift up your eyes then, and behold its glory; Not to envy, but to delight in, it: Always to profeſs ſuch a Faith as is Primitive and Apoſtolical, that delivers no other Principles to the world, but what our Saviour did before, what his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles commented on, and a Faith that

S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſayes, that they are <hi>Wells without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; Clouds that are carried with a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt</hi>; but yet ſuch, <hi>to whom the midſt of darkneſs is reſerved for ever:</hi> (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>ch.</hi> 17.). Certainly, ſuch men muſt needs be wrong, who, by frequent ſhifting, declare to the world, that they do not know which opinion is right; but, like ſticks and ſtraws, are carried with the ſtream, and alwayes ſwim down with the River: Their faith muſt needs ſtagger, who thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to every ſtroke; and certainly he muſt dye and periſh, that with a naked breaſt is willing to receive all the wounds that his adverſaries will give him. If ſuch men are to be deem'd religious, ſober men would become prophane; and if theſe are they that make a Church, the more rational part will enter into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle, or any place diſtant from theſe. What! muſt a man be a Fool to become a Prophet? or cannot he be ſpiritual, unleſs he be mad? Muſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that brings peace to the world, be the only bone of contention among men, which they caſt at one anothers heads? Shall that which teaches us
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100880:31"/>
ſelf-denyal, patience, humility, and obedience, be pleaded for a breach of all theſe? Shall our Saviour's Kingdom be of this World, notwithſtanding his own proteſtation to the contrary? Or thoſe that are zealous for the Doctrine of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> propagate it by that Sword which yet S. <hi>Peter</hi> was rebuked for uſing? Will men be bold to aſſume to themſelves the names of Chriſtians, and yet act more cruelties than the <hi>Turks?</hi> Or call the holy <hi>Jeſus</hi> their Maſter, and yet openly violate all his Laws? Can they bow their knees to him, and yet preſently carry him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to be crucified? Can men think it reaſonable, that a faith ſhould be manured with the blood of others, that was planted at firſt in the Martyrdom of Believers? Or can any be ſuppoſed to have received power from on high, to conſtitute our Saviour a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vider of inheritances, when he himſelf has refuſed the Office, and gave the perſon a rebuke that deſired him to accept it, by asking him that queſtion (<hi>Luke</hi> 12.14.): <hi>Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?</hi> In vain is it for men, deſigning diſturbances in the World, to pretend that they follow
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100880:31"/>
the commands of Heaven when they knock the Crown of our Saviour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Sovereigns, or fight with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one Scepter againſt the other; unleſs they can reach high enough to pull the <hi>Sun</hi> and the <hi>Stars</hi> from the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that no light may ſhine upon the World; Or void the Goſpel by inſpiration. The Proteſtant world is too wiſe now to be again thus fool'd; Men muſt chuſe a night for ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns as theſe, and ſtay, yet, a little longer, if they intend to meet with <hi>Bats</hi> and <hi>Owles</hi>; The age is not dark and melancholy enough to bring in <hi>Monke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> among theſe; nor has ignorance, that Mother of Popiſh devotion, yet ſufficiently prepared our minds to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Doctrines of Papiſts, or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts; Nor are the brains of ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and ſober men yet beat out, that there may be room for Dreams and Viſions; Nor have we ſo forgotten the Scriptures, as to be guided only by pretended inſpiration, or to be frighted out of our Faith and Principles, by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very new and unexpected apparition: Nor are we ſo ignorant of mens devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as to be baffled out of our Religion by thoſe that are deceived themſelves;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100880:32"/>
Or to accompliſh deſigns of malice, or ambition, would ſubtily endeavour to impoſe on others. We know the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt virtue and vice, and have a Rule to judge Doctrines and Preachers by; and know how to judge of thoſe that now pretend to preſent inſpiration, and thoſe that follow ſuch pretenders; And we well hope that we ſhall not twice in the ſame age, be catch'd and entangled in the ſame ſnare; To prevent which diſmal and fatal ruine, permit me (in the laſt place) to exhort you to what I cannot command, with the ſacred Apoſtle; (though the World was then alſo to be gain'd by intreaty, as appears by his kind compellation, <hi>Beloved:</hi> A word that is uſed (I will not ſay practiſed too, by men that love fornication in Religion, and too often without a metaphor) by thoſe who are far differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the ſpirit and life of our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle; Yea, ſo often, that it takes up time, in their diſcourſes, fills the room of ſence, and is therefore worn out, and, as they manage it, is grown ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous:) Yet let me exhort men that are <hi>beloved of the Lord,</hi> and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon, by me alſo, and all honeſt

Lake be placed in the Skies, or men, that have their wits about them, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake the flames of Hell for Heaven? Shall the Devil lead us with as good aſſurance, as if he were an <hi>Angel of light?</hi> Or any walk by ſo looſe a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, as cannot diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> and <hi>true?</hi> Many men are ſuch ſtrange fataliſts, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come altogether indifferent in their Choice; and concluding their Fortunes to be written on their foreheads, they care not whether they make any at all: This is an Opinion, which, when in its conſequence purſued, will make thoſe that really eſpouſe it (and with equal reaſon) to be as regardleſs of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral welfare, as they are of their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and take a great deal of pains and care either to do ill, or nothing at all to any purpoſe: Then indeed men might as ſecurely go into a Peſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, as take the Air, receive fire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their boſoms, and yet never fear burning; One might endeavour to beat a thouſand, and we might run on the points of naked Swords, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more danger of wounds or death, than if we were at quiet in our Beds, or guarded in the midſt of Troops and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100880:33"/>
Armies: But whatever courage ſuch ſtrange Principles may ſeem to inſpire men withal; Yet to be ſure they are not breath'd from Heaven, nor inſpired themſelves; Theſe Doctrines may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably make ſtout Soldiers, but never will make a good Chriſtian; Suited indeed they are to ſuch as think a Sword the beſt mean to propagate Religion; which is the reaſon why the <hi>Turk</hi> embraces them: But they thwart and contradict ſuch a Goſpel as brought peace to all who will embrace it, and not propagate its belief, by war or blood, by open force or ſecret conſpiracy: Alas! men had need to be wary, when eternal welfare is in hazard, and endeavour to play their game well, when their own Salvation lies at ſtake. We know, by ſad and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful experience, <hi>that many falſe Prophets are gone abroad into the world:</hi> And ſhall we, ſtill, with an indifferent, though equal, affection purſue all? We may then lodge a <hi>viper in our boſoms,</hi> drink Poyſon inſtead of Potions, ſwallow a Serpent inſtead of a Fiſh, and eat the very ſtones for Bread: we may thus ſafely halt betwixt two opinions, and be both for <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Baal; Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Mammon</hi> may become equal, and it
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100880:34"/>
will be no matter what we worſhip, ſo as we worſhip any thing at all. But, 'tis a plain ſign of a wanton palate that muſt be taſting every diſh: And when the <hi>Manna</hi> is ſet before us, 'tis evident that we loath it if we deſire <hi>Quails:</hi> If the meſſengers of Sathan may trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves into the Miniſters of the Goſpel, as well as the Devil into an <hi>Angel of light</hi>; we had need to view men before we entertain them, and examine Doctrines before we receive them. Will any rational and wiſe man venture on a precipice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out neceſſity? or take pleaſure in ſuch hazard to have the vanity and glory of relating it, when one ſlip proves irrecoverable, and his fall bruiſes him all to pieces? And yet this is the ſtate of thoſe men who, at all adventures, attend the fancies and imaginations of others, or without trial receive their own; They are like perſons travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in a Wood, who may ſooner meet with Beaſts of prey, than any men ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to relieve or direct them. How eaſie is it for thoſe that are once out of the way, and travelling on without knowledge or direction, to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſt like a man in a Wilderneſs,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100880:34"/>
or run among the Tents of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or blunder upon that which they have loſt their way to eſcape? They may miſtake <hi>Rome</hi> in the dark to be their own City, and think <hi>Tyber</hi> to be the <hi>Thames</hi>; and may lodge there, if they are thus deluded, when they think they are ſafe in their own Beds: The <hi>Wolves</hi> are now abroad in the World, nay ſuch as will neither be frightned with a Drum, nor yet be charmed and tamed by a Fiddle, or a Pipe. Let not the <hi>Sheep</hi> then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them, nor the <hi>flock of Chriſt</hi> feed nigh them, leſt the Shepherds themſelves are forced to fly, when they can no longer govern, or defend, them: Thoſe, therefore, that are Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized into the Chriſtian profeſſion, that have vowed obedience to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of the Goſpel, ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that their Religion is not now to chuſe; But that they have engaged in the Chriſtian profeſſion, and are to live according to its directions; And, therefore, are to be ſo far from believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any pretended inſpirations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to theſe Rules, that they muſt abandon them as impious and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; their everlaſting welfare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100880:35"/>
upon it; and eternity is not a thing to be played with; nor Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be ſtaked at hazard. No zeal, nor confidence, of others muſt ſhake, or alter, our reſolutions; Nor muſt we change upon any extravagant mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our own: We muſt not like <hi>Barnabas,</hi> (Gal. 2.13.) be carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the diſſimulation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> nor taken with any gaudy Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>; but <hi>hold faſt the form of ſound words, and contend with earneſtneſs for that faith which was once delivered unto the Saints:</hi> We muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to that ſtanding Miniſtry inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our Saviour, and continued to us through Ages and Generations, <hi>not forſaking the aſſembling our ſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the manner of ſome is</hi>; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if we thus ſin wilfully, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing our profeſſion, <hi>when we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more Sacrifice for ſin, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation, which ſhall devour the adverſaries,</hi> (Heb. 10.25.). <hi>For if thoſe that deſpiſed Moſes's Law, died without mercy, under two or three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; Of how much ſorer puniſhment ſhall they be thought worthy, who tread
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100880:35"/>
under foot the Son of God, and count the blood of the Covenant a common thing, and by their wilful revolt, do deſpite to the Spirit of Grace?</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us that <hi>Chriſt is the head of the Church,</hi> (the reſt are only ſubordinate unto him) <hi>from whom the whole body fitly join'd together, maketh increaſe of the body unto the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying it ſelf in love</hi>; And therefore he exhorts, <hi>that we be no more children, toſs'd to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the ſleight of men, and cunning craftineſs, whereby they lay in wait to deceive</hi> (Epheſ. 4.14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>). And ſhall we, to whom our Faith is Ancient, be more eaſie to be drawn away, than they who had but newly received it? God forbid that we ſhould ſo diſgrace our profeſſion, when they that are engaged in a falſe opinion, can die reſolutely, though not for this only, yet without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing it: If they do much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on principles of honour, ſhall not we do more upon thoſe of Religion? Shall we that have been bred into ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Maximes, be drawn aſide by a mad-man or a fool, if he is but able to pronounce inſpiration? This is the way to entertain any Doctrines of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100880:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
men, though never ſo wild, if they will be ſo hardy as to ſuffer for them, and to take the pack of a common Ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, for the burden of the Lord, if we find him to ſtoop and crouch under it: Thus we may be <hi>carried by the Spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Wilderneſs,</hi> and take him for an <hi>Angel that miniſters to us:</hi> But we are ſufficiently cautioned againſt ſuch miſtakes, if we will but follow the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of the Scriptures: For our Saviour has cautioned us againſt <hi>falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets</hi>; and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> adviſes men, <hi>that they ſhould not be carried about with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and ſtrange Doctrines; becauſe it is a good thing that the hearts be eſtabliſhed with grace, (i. e.</hi> the Goſpel) <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.9. And we had need all of us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, and be exceeding cautious and wary in this; to gueſs at <hi>Wolves</hi> by their howling and devouring, let their cloathing be what it will; that no ſubtilty may circumvent us, nor creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into houſes, <hi>lead the ſilly women captive</hi>; nor cauſe us to ſtray after them. We know the Devil is both cunning and diligent, and that he ſuits his temptations to the various inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and diſpoſitions of men; that <hi>he
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100880:36"/>
walks about like a roaring Lion, but 'tis only to ſeek whom he may devour,</hi> (1 Pet. 5.8.). The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> were pains-taking men; <hi>For they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed Sea and Land to make a proſelyte; but when they had made him, he became twice more the child of Hell than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:</hi> (Matth. 23.15.). Let us not, then, under the pretence of new diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, <hi>forſake that which has been from the beginning; but let the ſame mind be in us, which was in Chriſt Jeſus</hi>; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to S. <hi>Pauls</hi> advice, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17, 18.) <hi>Let us mark them which cauſe diviſions and offences contrary to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine we have learned, and avoid them; becauſe they are ſuch as ſerve not our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own belly, and by good words and fair ſpeeches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the hearts of the ſimple. Then</hi> (as it follows) <hi>the God of peace ſhall bruiſe Sathan under our feet ſhortly.</hi> Let us live in that unity, which our holy Religion preſcribes to us, not raiſe or abett diſturbances in the world, but endeavour to fulfil S. <hi>Pauls</hi> joy, and make our Miniſters task eaſie, <hi>in being like minded, having the ſame love, being of one accord, and of one judgement; that nothing be done through ſtrife, or vain
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100880:37"/>
glory,</hi> (Philip. 2. at the beginning.). For if we are drawn, by hearkening to the various pretences of men, that yet account themſelves inſpired, to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes biting and devouring one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we ſhall be conſumed one of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: And this we are not only in our own age taught by experience; but the Apoſtle has long ago admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed men of this, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 5.15.). <hi>Let us live, therefore, like thoſe that have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed rules of faith, and converſation; endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the bond of peace:</hi> And then, if we thus live in this world, we ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained in the glory of the next.</p>

               <p>HAving thus diſcours'd the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Caution, and evidenced to you, that every one that pretends to Revelation, is not to be believ'd: I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the ſecond particular I propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which contains a Direction, how we may diſentangle our ſelves from thoſe perplexities, and different opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that various men, under the ſame pretenſion, puzzle us withal. <hi>But try the Spirits whether they are of God.</hi> Now as this is a metaphorical expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, taken from thoſe who bring Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals to the Touchſtone, that they may diſcern the difference betwixt them, that they may be able to value them proportionably to their worth: So <hi>to try the Spirits,</hi> is to examine the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines that ſuch pretenders deliver to the world, and to diſcern betwixt true and falſe; and accordingly <hi>judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are from God or no.</hi> It was the duty of the Prieſts under the Law,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100880:38"/>
to ſhew the people the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>prophane,</hi> and to cauſe men to diſcern betwixt <hi>the clean and the unclean,</hi> (Ezek. 44.23.). And the duty is continued under the Goſpel, in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Doctrines and pretenſions of men. For as our Saviour foretold, that many falſe Prophets would ariſe in his Name, with pretenſions to his power and authority, ſo we find them too ſuddenly after this prediction to have gone abroad into the World: and even yet continuing their boldneſs and impiety, dividing the Church, and not only troubling particular men, but whole Societies, overturning Thrones, diſſolving Government, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt mankind, and raiſing confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not only in Secular, but Religious affairs: To prevent therefore ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable diſturbances, that Religion may not cover malice or ambition, nor give any countenance to the humours or impieties of men, we muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to preſerve this entire without any mixtures of villany or impoſture, and by ſome certain characters know what properly belongs to it, that we may not lye open to the fancies or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of thoſe who cunningly ruine
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100880:38"/>
our principles and profeſſion. And, ſince new Lights are continually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the view of men, which they too eaſily gaze at till their eyes are dazled, we muſt endeavour to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh theſe blazing Comets from the true and fixed Stars in the Firmament, by which we are to be guided on Earth, and directed in our way to Heaven: We muſt try both Doctrines and thoſe that publiſh them, <hi>whether they are of God, becauſe many falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are gone out into the world.</hi> If you will take an old Apoſtles advice againſt the pretended infallibility of new, he adviſes you, <hi>to prove all things, but ſtill to hold faſt that which is good:</hi> (1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.21.) We muſt try the Doctrines, Opinions, Examples, nay, even the Actions of all pretenders to revelation; <hi>(for by their fruits ye ſhall know them,</hi> ſayes our Saviour). And what we call Tender Conſciences, as well as thoſe that are very raw, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rubb'd often by reaſon of their former commiſſions, when they are not guided by a well balanced judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are moſt apt to have ſecret combats within themſelves, and to be ſenſible of the leaſt touch upon them:
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100880:39"/>
For the beſt things in this World have ſome inconvenience ſtill attending them; and that which in ſome caſes is good, with other circumſtances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes evil; and moſt men that have an itch upon their ears, have had a ſcab firſt upon their minds. The beſt Gold is moſt ductile, and a Tender Conſcience, if the judgement be not the governour of the affections, is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily enſlaved to ſuch principles as ſuit with paſſion, and make impreſſions on the temperaments and bodily diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men: A ſeal we know makes the faireſt and moſt laſting impreſſion upon ſuch Wax as is firſt ſoftned, and a tender Conſcience, where the head is as ſoft as the paſſions plyable, eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receives the next Image, though to the blotting out and defacing the old: We had need therefore, when any man comes under a pretence of ſome new inſpiration, to examine well both the perſon and his doctrine, and receive to our own the skill of others, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe whom God has ſet over us in the Lord; we may otherwiſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the true <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> ſhall combine together, or ſingly encounter it.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100880:39"/>
been lately (and are not yet out of danger) ſo vex'd with parties diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from one another, whilſt one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme rides the other, that the caution againſt <hi>believing every Spirit,</hi> cannot too often be repeated, nor our trial of all Preachers and Doctrines be too frequently urged and practiſed. Our Saviour gives his Diſciples a caution (who yet had the view of thoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles which we only believe) <hi>that they ſhould take heed that no man deceive them,</hi> (Mat. 24.4.): that they might not entertain a ſecret enemy inſtead of a boſom friend; And certainly we have much more reaſon to beware now, although there were falſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders then: For if they durſt, when our Saviour was in the world, deſign the ſubverſion of his Goſpel, when his infinite underſtanding could baffle their arguments, and his viſible Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, rebuke their folly in ſetting up any Doctrine for Divine, that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted what he delivered; certainly much more now, when the Goſpel is delivered, and Miracles for its confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation are ceaſed; And men are not now to expect new, but to believe the old: Nay, when the Goſpel it ſelf is
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100880:40"/>
often perverted to evil deſigns, and under a pretence of mens Offering to God, they Sacrifice to the Devil. The Church is now, and our Religion in it, like a Ship at Sea, toſs'd in a ſtorm, and, through the Providence of God, we are put into a Creek to careen and repair; Let us examine, therefore, all the leaky parts of the Veſſel, and ſupply all the defects of Maſts, or rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging before we put to Sea again; And mind what Paſſengers we take in, that they may neither blow us up, nor ſink us. As the Apoſtle warns the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> ſo muſt I admoniſh you, <hi>that no man deceive you with vain words,</hi> (Epheſ. 5.6.). As if any wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by what authority ſoever co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured, could free thoſe who teach or practiſe it, from the revenge of Heaven; <hi>For becauſe of theſe things</hi> (ſaies the Apoſtle) <hi>cometh the wrath of God on the children of diſobedience.</hi> Here indeed, in this world, good men frequently ſuffer the ſame temporal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils with the bad; Becauſe, being in the ſame community, and the offence being that of the whole Society, when the greater part become vicious, the Wheat is ſindged by thoſe flames that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100880:40"/>
burn the chaff; For the ſeparation of theſe is not compleated till a future ſtate renders juſtice exact and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: And communities muſt be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed here, becauſe in the other life theſe ſhall ceaſe, and every man bear his own burden. It becomes us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, (ſince we muſt every one then anſwer for our ſelves) to examine well our belief and practice; and not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our own ſouls in being led by the falſe principles of another: Hence is it that S. <hi>Paul</hi> adviſes, <hi>that every man examine himſelf before he partakes at the Lords Table,</hi> (1 Cor. 11.28.). And in the ſecond <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 13<hi>th Chap.</hi> 5<hi>th verſ.</hi> he exhorts men <hi>to examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves whether they are in the faith, and to prove their own ſelves:</hi> And that a man <hi>ſhould try his own work, that he may have rejoycing in himſelf alone, and not in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Becauſe every one ſhall bear his own burthen,</hi> (Gal. 6.4, 5.). But yet becauſe many things in Religion, are placed beyond the examination of every man, whoſe duty 'tis to embrace them; I muſt here lay down ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, and rules to limit ſuch as may be otherwiſe apt to be extravagant, and extend this duty of <hi>trying Spirits,</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:100880:41"/>
beyond their own power and capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And (1.) We that diſcourſe of the Chriſtian Religion, and are fully convinced that it is true, muſt take it as it is expreſſed to the world, in thoſe Books of Scripture in which it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; Now theſe acquaint us that there are ſome ſet apart to be Guides to others, and therefore diſtinguiſh the Church, into <hi>Paſtors and people</hi>; Into thoſe that are <hi>Guides,</hi> and thoſe that <hi>are to be conducted by them</hi>; Into <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>unlearned:</hi> But becauſe all rules guide men no farther than they are deſigned; To render theſe proper and effectual, all collateral and ſubordinate helps are to be uſed in the application of the Rule: We muſt take, therefore, the help of the Learned, and rely on their honeſty, and skill, in thoſe things which an inferiour Education (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch Miracles as are not now rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably to be expected) cannot capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citate men to reach; Nor can they paſs a judgement upon thoſe things which they have not the advantage of knowing. Thus, that the Scriptures are truly Tranſlated, muſt be taken for granted by thoſe that cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Originals: And the Books
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100880:41"/>
which we receive, as the Rule of Faith, and directions for mens lives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> muſt be ſuppoſed to have been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by thoſe inſpired men, whoſe names they bear, among thoſe that have not leiſure nor skill enough to prove them to be ſo by any argument or authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And when theſe principles are ſetled, (2.) The Scriptures having ſome points more difficult to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; we muſt, farther, make uſe of our Guides, and thoſe whom our Saviour has appointed over us to interpret to us ſuch points in Religion which we are not capable of unridling our ſelves; and not adventure above our ſtrength in judging things which we have not learned: This becomes the natural modeſty of mankind, and is more eſpecially agreeable to that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility of mind, and thoſe docile diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions which become the Goſpel: The contrary humours and actions of men are what make ſo many Schiſms in the Church, and lay them open to the errors and impoſtures of thoſe who, out of ignorance or deſign, eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevail upon, and lead, the ſimple. In plain things (ſuch as moſt of the duties of Religion are) every man of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100880:42"/>
an ordinary capacity may well be able to judge for himſelf: But if they will enter into Controverſie, eſpecially ſuch as have puzled the learned, 'tis no wonder that they are led into mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, and their own obſtinacy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to their ignorance, makes their error become an Hereſie: Or if men will proceed in thoſe things, of which they might be capable of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by falſe meaſures and courſes which are irregular, not relying, at all, on thoſe helps and aids which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon dictates, and God hath both ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and allowed; 'Tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then that they impoſe upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by falſe reaſoning inſtead of true; or that they may be fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the impreſſions of others when deſigning men impoſe upon them by any fallacious and alluring pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. (3.) Even in plain caſes, when private men, that are not diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any publick character, judge for themſelves, they ought to confine their opinions to themſelves, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them only to have an influence on their own actions, they having no more power to impoſe them on others, than other private men have
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100880:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to impoſe theirs on them. For all private men being in this reſpect e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, none has authority to trouble o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but they muſt leave them to their own reaſon and choice, which is the ſame liberty that they claim them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by vertue of the natural privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of men. (4) It muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed antecedently to the trial of the Doctrines of men, that pretend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, that under the ſame claim and title, <hi>ſome are true,</hi> and <hi>ſome falſe</hi>; For if all were true, there would be no need of <hi>trying Spirits</hi>; But we muſt, contrary to the Apoſtles caution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all who confidently affirm that they are inſpired from above: Yet our own experience ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that oppoſite Doctrines at the ſame time have been, and are ſtill, vented in the world, with the ſame confidence, with the ſame pretenſion; And we know that the parts of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction cannot, at the ſame time, be true; And, therefore, one being falſe, muſt by ſearch and trial be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenced from the other; that men may diſcern what Doctrines immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately oblige them, being ſtamp'd with Divine authority; And what are to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100880:43"/>
be rejected by them, being either the product of the diſpoſitions of mens bodies, or evil projects and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of men; Or elſe ſuch as enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by the ſubtilty, power, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections of the Devil. Now theſe things being thus ſtated; I proceed plainly to prove that it is the duty of every man to try and examine all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to inſpiration, whether they are of God or no, before they receive and entertain them as ſuch. (2.) Give you ſome Directions how to know when any Prophet pretending to inſpiration, comes from God: And (3) Make ſome application of the whole, becauſe the expreſſion and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is very uſeful.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Then, to prove that it is our general duty to examine theſe preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded inſpirations will appear, (1.) Not only from the Apoſtles direction, which, to thoſe that own S. <hi>Johns</hi> authority, is ſufficient to inforce the duty, without any argument or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the thing; But alſo it is the great reaſon of giving rules to be the meaſure of what is ſtraight or crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; This is the general deſign of Laws, and thoſe innate notions of virtue and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100880:43"/>
vice implanted in the minds of rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal men, and confer'd upon them with their very beings. And this is the reaſon of <hi>Gods manifeſting his will to the world,</hi> that by it men may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to direct their lives, and regulate their belief, ſo as to preſerve order and peace here, and procure to them happineſs hereafter. Now to what purpoſe ſhould theſe things be, were it not mens duty to examine things in Religion by them, ſince the revelation of Gods will to any creatures is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reaſon why they ſhould obey it, and is to be the rule of their actions, for that time in which it is ordained to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is the duty of men to examine Doctrines, <hi>whether they are of God</hi>; Becauſe, in things of a more inferiour concernment, it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed reaſonable among mankind to receive or embrace them without tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and judgment upon them. No man will deal in the commodities of his trade, without either viewing them himſelf, or taking them on the skill and integrity of one whom he can truſt, and confide in: None re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a ſumm of money, but that he
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100880:44"/>
will both number and examine the Coin; That ſo his goods may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the price; And the Coin he receives may appear to be true, and not counterfeit. If we find a Quotation out of a Book, on which is concluded matter of moment, we will, before we ſettle our notion and belief, examine the Author on whoſe authority the caſe depends; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he is of ſufficient credit to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force that thing; and whether he be rightly quoted and repreſented: Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind would otherwiſe continually be impoſed upon; They might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive poyſon inſtead of food, and be placed here in this World on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be cheated and deceived; and enjoy their lives at greater hazards than the moſt inferiour Beaſt that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes. Things that are obvious to our outward ſenſes, may, by their likeneſs to one another, or an artificial varniſh, many times, deceive us; ſo that what our eyes behold, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee: And may not the inward ſenſes of our minds, by methods that are conformable to our faculties, be cheated by various and falſe repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations? Theſe things we have repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100880:44"/>
experience of, and they need not any farther illuſtration. If therefore, in our temporal concerns there is ſo great occaſion of warineſs and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; Have we not need to be more cautious in relation to ſpiritual, and the matters of religion? Or do we think our bodies ſuperiour to our ſouls; or things temporal, to be of greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, than thoſe that are eternal? If not; it is evident, that we muſt uſe trial in both; and our diligence muſt be advanced ſuitable to the dignity and value of our concern. Our Saviour uſes ſuch an example (from any I cannot take a better) when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes the Scribes and Phariſees, that were ſo preciſe and ſcrupulous about ſmaller matters; Who could <hi>ſtrain at a Gnat,</hi> but yet <hi>ſwallow a Camel</hi>: that could exactly obſerve the outward face and appearance of the Heavens; but would not take notice of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, which was yet more to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by men; They could gueſs at the weather by rule and obſervation; But would not <hi>diſcern the ſigns of the times,</hi> neither in relation to the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> nor the ſafety, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, of <hi>Jeruſalem, (Matth.</hi> 16.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100880:45"/>
2, 3.). And is it not ſtrange, after ſo ſolemn a rebuke, that men, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing faith in the reprover, ſhould yet run into the ſame error, and not exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine a buſineſs that is of the greateſt concernment, when, yet, they will be extreamly diligent, in what is of a far leſs value? Alas! what is time, in compariſon of eternity? Or our abode here, when ſet in oppoſition to what ſtate we ſhall be in hereafter? There is no compariſon at all betwixt them; And, therefore, we ought to be much more inquiſitive about what we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive for Doctrines, either to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, or practiſed (ſince on them depends our eternal welfare), than we ſhould be for the greateſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this world; Which if they dye not, and periſh with the uſing, and make themſelves wings, that they may fly away; Yet a very ſmall time ſhall determine their uſe, as to us: And then, according to our eſpouſals and practice of Religion, we muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into eternal bliſs, or miſery.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is our duty to try the Spirits, becauſe the examination of the Doctrines and Opinions of men, in Gods name vented to the world, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100880:45"/>
and commended in Sacred Writ. As the Womans Alabaſter Box of Ointment is recorded in the Scripture, that this perſons piety and kindneſs to our Saviour might not eſcape the notice of poſterity; But whereſoever the Goſpel ſhould be preached in the world, this action ſhould be told for a memorial of her, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 26.13.): So we want not ſuch examples, and approbations of them, as may recommend the diligence and inquiries of men, before they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive principles under pretence of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, to all poſterity to read and imitate: Thus the <hi>Bereans</hi> were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>More Noble</hi> by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> than than thoſe of <hi>Theſſalonica</hi>; becauſe, when the Goſpel was preached to them, they did not receive it at all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, but examined, whether the relations agreed with the predictions of the Prophets, and the rules of life were coherent with the principles of Humane Nature, the Being and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of Almighty God, the Notions and Reaſon of Mankind; But, more eſpecially with the Scriptures which they had already received: Which they ſearched daily, that they might
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100880:46"/>
by them be enabled to know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Doctrines delivered were true (<hi>Acts</hi> 17.11.). Had God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed any infallible Judge upon earth, or reſolved alwayes to fix his Laws in the minds of men by any new authorized revelations, or any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and extraordinary diſcoveries: As there would not have been need of any ſtanding Rule; ſo the Apoſtle would not have commended theſe Jews for comparing the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Old, nor for ſearching the Scriptures, to know whether the Apoſtles Doctrine was true, ſince he came to preach by virtue of inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, 'Tis our duty to try the Spirits, that is, to examine the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Opinions of thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be guided and acted by the Spirit; Becauſe there are ſeveral ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that accrew to men by a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent examination of theſe things. As (1.) It is the only way to avoid the inſinuations of thoſe, who, under this pretence, captivate and enſlave the affections of many, leading them into a falſe Religion, and deceiving them of the priviledges and rewards of the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100880:46"/>
Goſpel; And ſo their peace and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is diſſolved here, and they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe eternal miſery hereafter. The taking away this liberty of enquiring from men, is what ſupports the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> when having deprived men of their ſight, they lead them which way they pleaſe; and ſpirit them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the chambers of death, when they think they are going to the land of the living: This is what cauſes many to believe the Prieſts gain to be their own godlineſs, whilſt ignorance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets a ſtrange devotion; and inſtead of being lead by the Spirit of God, they are hurried away by that of deluſion: And then <hi>Egypt</hi> or a Wilderneſs will be as pleaſant as the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the Night become as glorious as the Day, to ſuch as have no eyes to ſee it. The want of tryal and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of theſe things, makes the Sects, among our ſelves, to be catched and halter'd by the ſubtilty of others, till they are betrayed into the hands of thoſe, who uſe them as Stalking hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to catch others, till the Jeſuits caſt their Net over them, and then the <hi>Romans</hi> come, and take away our Kingdom. To forbid this tryal and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100880:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
judgement of things, is to render the faculties of a man uſeleſs, to degrade him into the nature of a Beaſt, and to bring a ſtrange <hi>Metempſychoſis</hi> amongſt us, by tranſplanting mens ſouls into other creatures, whilſt their bodies live, and act in the world: Or to make them, in religious affairs, (which are the greateſt concernments they have here) to forſake the Law of God, and the Teſtimony, to ſeek unto them that have familiar Spirits: Or, <hi>unto the Wizzards, that peep, and mutter; when a people ſhould ſeek unto their God, and not for the living to the dead,</hi> (Iſa. 8.19.).</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) By a ſerious tryal and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Doctrines of men that pretend to inſpiration, we ſhall, in all probability, keep our faith ſound and entire: For there being, among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but one true Faith as well as Baptiſm, and one God the Father of our Lord Jeſus; Since there may be many Articles of Belief exhibited to men different from the true; It muſt needs become the only means to keep our faith ſound and blameleſs, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining things before we receive them, and trying men that pretend to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100880:47"/>
inſpiration, before we entertain their Doctrines in our minds, or make them the objects of our belief. A Ship that equally ſpreads her Sails to all the Storms and contrary Winds, muſt not only lengthen her Voyage, and be toſs'd in the midſt of the Waves and Tempeſt; But frequently be in danger of a Wreck, if it be not loſt and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed. There is no leſs hazard in the matters of our faith: If we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, without care, to lay open to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wind of doctrine, we may then not only be toſs'd to and fro, but at once make ſhipwrack of faith and a good conſcience. The Devil is both a Thief and a Murtherer; ſo he was from the beginning; and ſtill walks about as a roaring Lyon, ſeeking whom he may devour: And how eaſie is it for him to enter the minds of men, and to ſteal away their faith, or hinder it from a vital influence upon their actions, if the doors of their ſouls continually are open, and are not at all lock'd or barr'd? He may then come to us in his own ſhape, without transforming himſelf into an Angel of light; and both ſolicite and enſlave our minds, whilſt we let him
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100880:48"/>
paſs without examining: And yet, in Ports ſubject to invaſion, and Garriſons that may be capable of ſurprize, we allow continual Watch and Ward; and Orders to them are ſo ſtrict in time of danger, that none, who is not publickly known to be a friend, may enter without a ſtrict examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, leſt he betray the place, and let in the enemy: No leſs advantage is it to the mind, to preſerve our faith ſpotleſs and unblemiſh'd, to have a Sentinel alwayes at our Senſes, through which our ſouls make their ſallies; leſt the adverſary again enters with them, and they are deſtroyed by the ſame way in which they hoped to preſerve themſelves: We muſt guard our minds, and have a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man alwayes upon the Tower, that our underſtandings themſelves which govern both our choice and affections be not enſnared into falſe principles, which will defile our actions, and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine our ſouls. This is the way to <hi>keep our ſelves harmleſs and undefiled, the ſons of God in the midſt of that crooked and perverſe generation amongſt whom we live; and hereafter to ſhine like Stars in the midſt of the Firmament
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100880:48"/>
for ever.</hi> This is the deſign of Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s exhorting men <hi>to hold faſt the form of ſound words,</hi> (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.); and of his thanking God, <hi>that the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans <hi>then</hi> (though ſince they have departed from it) <hi>obeyed from the heart the form of doctrine delivered to them: (Rom.</hi> 6.17.); and of S. <hi>Jude</hi>'s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting all Chriſtians <hi>to contend ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly for that faith which was once deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto the Saints:</hi> (in the third Verſe of his Epiſtle.). For, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any men boldly ſay, we have as much reaſon to examine our belief, as our actions, and to take as great care of the principles, as we do in the practice, of our Religion: For not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our reaſon concludes this, becauſe the underſtandings are the principal faculty of our ſouls; But for that theſe direct our wills, and influence all the actions of our lives: And God will not accept of thoſe, who exchange their Creed for any publick faith, that betrayes thoſe Articles men ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; Safety or ruine depends upon it; Becauſe not only Baptiſm and the outward Ordinances of our Saviours inſtitution, are required to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſalvation of men; But <hi>he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100880:49"/>
not ſhall be damned,</hi> (Mark 16.16.). <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> not minding theſe things, put away Faith and a good conſcience, and ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack'd their belief in the midſt of error; and for this, <hi>they were deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto Sathan,</hi> (1 Tim. 1. 19, 20.). If the Orthodoxy of mens judgments and opinions of things, were not of great and eternal concernment in the times of the Goſpel, the old ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes might be ſtill embraced, or the Law of Nature remain the only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection unto men, without any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther revelation: But S. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us of errors that are damnable, <hi>which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title men unto ſwift deſtruction,</hi> (2 Pet. 2.1.). And, if there were not great caution to be uſed in relation to mens Principles and Belief, Faith would not have been made the condition of the Goſpel, nor the qualification to juſtifie a ſinner.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) By a ſtrict examination of Principles and Doctrines, we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the peace of our own conſciences; For if conſcience in things pertaining to Religion, conſiſts in the agreement of our notions, with the will of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto men; Then the trial of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100880:49"/>
Opinions (under whatever pretence they ſeem to be conveyed) by this rule, and accordingly either rejecting or receiving them, muſt much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the peace and quiet of our own minds, which are regulated by the ſame rule, by which we examine Doctrines and Opinions. And can there be a greater advantage to men on Earth, than full ſatisfaction, and a quiet conſcience, ſettled upon an unalterable and firm foundation? Contentment, in the enjoyments of this world, is that which makes the meaneſt Peaſant as happy as his Prince, and creates a level amongſt mankind; How much greater delight then muſt that ſatisfaction advance men to, which relates to things of an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting concernment, that cauſes the pangs of death ro vaniſh, and the fears of Hell and torment to depart; that carries us with all ſteadineſs and peace, through all the billows and ſtorms of the World, into that bleſſed Haven of reſt and tranquillity, where we ſhall know no trouble any more? This is enjoying a perpetual Feaſt, a pleaſure beyond the greateſt ſenſuality, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what men can otherwiſe poſſeſs,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100880:50"/>
or as much as invent or think upon: For what are then all the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or advantages of the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when in matters of Religion I am fix'd and ſetled? If I live in miſery, it cannot be long; nature will ſoon have ſpun her thread, if no accident cuts it off; And if, having my Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion fixed upon ſuch Principles which cannot deceive me, I regulate my acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by their directions, death muſt then be welcome to me, becauſe it gives me the fruits of my hope, and enters me into the joy of my Maſter, who from earth (having ſuffered an ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent ſeparation of ſoul and body) entered viſibly into his own glory, and has made a paſſage to the ſame for thoſe who live in the belief of what he has revealed, and the practice of that Religion which, in fulneſs of faith and indiſputable aſſurance, they have had a well grounded confidence in.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) This trial and examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Doctrines and Opinions of others, will make men endeavour to live without diſturbance in that Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of which they are members. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſturbs the Government of the world ſo much, as doubtings and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100880:50"/>
about Religion: But this, when found out by a regular enquiry, and truly eſtabliſhed in the minds of men, gives the greateſt and moſt effectual checks to all the breaches made upon encloſures, and thoſe irregularities and invaſions that are committed upon the properties of men: This forbids the Prince to be a Tyrant, and admoniſhes the Subjects to be obedient to the Laws; to become Subject for <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake, and not to rebel againſt the powers of this world, leſt they receive damnation in the next,</hi> (Rom. 13.). But when men are apt to entertain the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Principles of others, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to them under the ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Spirit, and inſpiration; With what eaſe are they enſnared, when they are either lazy, or refuſe to examine? There is nothing then ſo ruinous to Society: nothing that puts men more into confuſion; nothing that diſſolves the bands of Community, and breaks Order into a <hi>Chaos,</hi> but they will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt under the covert of Religion; and conclude they do ſervice unto God, when they are immediately offering to the Devil: For, the ſence of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being the greateſt tye upon man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100880:51"/>
what will they not attempt or ſuffer, when their actions, let them be never ſo full of villany, ſhall under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the authority, or inſpirations, of others, be adopted into the number of vertues, and heroick acts, and their ſufferings be advanced to Martyrdom? Juſtice ſhall be violated, when it ſhall be the act of Religion, to gain a Crown from the head of him that rightly wears it; And then they will make a way to the accompliſhment of their deſign, though they pave it through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out with the carkaſſes of the ſlain. But if ſuch Principles, that ruine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion under its name are well exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſubmitted to the trial of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and the Scriptures; and new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations are meaſured by thoſe that are old: We ſhall eaſily conclude that ſuch a Doctrine cannot come from God, that teaches men to do the works of the Devil; nor the Principles that tend to confuſion among mankind, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver proceed from a God of Order; But they are, upon the firſt audit, to be damn'd to the place from whence they took their original, and muſt be concluded to come from Hell, which thus fire and conſume the world. And
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100880:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo you ſee that the ſeveral advantages, which accrew to men upon trial of thoſe that pretend to inſpiration, may be ſo many incouragements to the thing; and ſo many arguments to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the duty to all thoſe who, by the Devil and his agents, do not love to be led captive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Finally,</hi> To what purpoſe were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties given to us that are able to judge, and, according to judgment, to make our choice in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, if by a pretence of any ones in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, the natural powers of our ſouls muſt ceaſe, or elſe be rendred uſeleſs; They being ſuſpended by a pretenſion of authority that, without examination, cannot appear to us to be Divine? Nay, why ſhould the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle impoſe ſuch a task upon us, which, without the uſe of every mans particular faculties, becomes impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? No choice will then be left in Religion to the generality of men; But it will become a neceſſary thing; and we are bound, like machins, to move alwayes by the impulſe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; nay quite contrary, to what we were obliged before, if the pretender to inſpiration change his note, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100880:52"/>
playes to us on a contrary ſtring. Would it not be ſtrange for any man to preach to, and exhort, ſtones; Or argue to one that were not capable of any impreſſion? Or could S. <hi>John</hi> be ſo unreaſonable as to impoſe the <hi>trial of Spirits</hi> on men that either have no faculties to examine, or have their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes tied up by a ſuperiour power? Muſt all <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> be rejected; and is there a neceſſity of mens believing what Doctrines have been revealed from Heaven; and muſt they not yet <hi>try the Spirits,</hi> and uſe their own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to examine them? To deny this may indeed be ſuitable to ſome Doctrines of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; Yet it cannot but be plain to a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; or any other reaſonable man, that has not his faculties given him in vain; that ſuch arguing, and ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief ſerve only to juſtifie impoſture un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence of truth, and to blind mens eyes, that they may be led into a ditch; This is to make fools of others, that they that cheat them may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted wiſe; and thoſe, who are thus impoſed upon, diſclaim the uſe of their own reaſon, and have eyes of their own, but ſee not; which is all one as
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100880:52"/>
to have none at all: And it muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear very ſtrange, that any man, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a clear ſight, ſhould yet refuſe to guide himſelf, but chuſe to be led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout like a Dog in a Halter.</p>

               <p>THere is yet one Argument more why we ſhould try and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Doctrines, that are pretended to be the effects of inſpiration; and that is what the Apoſtle makes the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Caution and Direction, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many falſe Prophets are gone out into the world</hi>: Now ſince theſe are many, enough to boaſt the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their number, to the ſtagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many weak men, and frightening that Authority which ſhould ſuppreſs them, and yet they remain <hi>falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> under what ſpecious pretences ſoever they appear; There is great reaſon why we ſhould <hi>prove</hi> and <hi>try them,</hi> that we may not be led away with the error of the wicked, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly hazard, if not ruine our ſouls. For, in matters of Religion, eſpecially where divers Opinions of the ſame thing are expoſed to us, our firſt bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs muſt alwayes be, according to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100880:53"/>
our capacity and power to ſettle our minds by a fixed choice of ſuch Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and fundamentals, of which we have ſuch good aſſurance as may fully convince us that they are true, and not falſe; and according to theſe to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect our lives: Which can never be done without enquiry, and judging, for our ſelves, of thoſe Doctrines that, under pretence of a Divine Authority, are, by any, propounded to our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. Since, therefore, there are ſo many <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> fluttering in the world, there is reaſon that we ſhould examine and try them; and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve every one that boldly affirms he came from God; leſt we enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thieves and robbers, in the room of hearty and honeſt friends; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of receiving a faithful Guide, we retain one that deludes us out of our way, till at laſt he lodges us in the chambers of Hell, inſtead of carrying us up to Heaven. But ſince no man comes with ſo great a pretence as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate inſpiration, or to deliver Gods will to the world, but that he will offer ſomething to recommend both himſelf and meſſage; ſince he knows he ſpeaks to men having the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:100880:54"/>
ſame faculties with himſelf, who have, at leaſt, their own reaſon to guide their choice, and cannot, if they are at all conſiderate, be raſh in their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of thoſe Doctrines, wherein their eternal welfare is concerned; It muſt of neceſſity quicken our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to try and ſift the Doctrines of men to the utmoſt of our power, and the more becauſe of the plauſible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that deceivers inſinuate themſelves by into the hearts and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of others; whoſe poyſon may appear wholſom to the eye, that yet gripes and ſwells the bowels: Amongſt many things, therefore, that render <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> difficult to be diſcerned, I ſhall inſtance in ſome, that, upon the view of them, and diſcovery of their deceit, we may uſe the utmoſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in our trial, and be the better prepared to entertain thoſe Rules, by which we may diſcern true inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from that which is falſe, and only pretended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> They will inveigh againſt the Principles you have already received, and thoſe that are the guides of your ſouls; As well knowing that a new building cannot be erected on that

ground on which another ſtood, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out demoliſhing the old, removing the materials, and clearing the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And this they alwayes do in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, according to the degrees of alteration which they deſign; till, at laſt perhaps, they introduce among you <hi>golden Calves, inſtead of the worſhip of the God of Iſrael:</hi> And if their enterprize be thus crown'd with a joyful ſucceſs, their language will be like that which we read (1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.18.). <hi>Behold, O Iſrael, the Gods that brought thee out of the land of Egypt!</hi> and then we muſt with proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion worſhip them. <hi>Falſe Prophets</hi> will come to you in <hi>ſheeps cloathing,</hi> the <hi>ravening Wolf</hi> ſhall not appear till he has an opportunity <hi>to devour you:</hi> The Principles of theſe would fill us with too much horror and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhould they appear all at once, and that before prejudice were remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; They endeavour, therefore, to gain by a gradual advancement upon us; abating the ſtrength of cuſtom and education; firſt ſtartling, and then ſeducing us; uſing methods to invalidate the old, before they ſettle new Principles: Nay, if they can but
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:100880:55"/>
make us indifferent betwixt both, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by argument or debauchery, their work then waits only a fitting oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity: But if the reſiſtance be ſo great that they cannot wholly captivate at once, they will aſſault where we are weakeſt, baffle us by degrees, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce one point dependently on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, till at laſt we become wholly theirs, before we are ſenſible of ſo great a change as they by ſucceſſion have wrought among us. 'Tis a vaſt advantage they gain againſt us, if they can but render us lazy in our enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or cauſe us to undervalue our Guides; Which they will never be wanting in, as long as an evil tongue can aſperſe, or ſecret whiſperings can do men injury, who are not preſent to anſwer for themſelves; Nay, as long as boldneſs can confront mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty; Or men that aſſume not equal advantages, may be either ſworn, or Hector'd, into ſilence. Let theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning men but once bring your Teachers into contempt, and it will not be long er'e they drive them into corners: The former has been long attempting, and not without conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſucceſs; God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> defend us againſt
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:100880:55"/>
the latter, leſt the people are deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for want of knowledge, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance becomes the Mother of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For we know what ſuch devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion means. Thus was it in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours time; the Jews branded him for an impoſtor and deceiver, that ſo they might argue his Doctrine to be falſe; and rather than own, that his Miracles ſhould prove divine, they blaſphemouſly attributed them to the power of the Devil, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 12.24.): <hi>And the Servant is not above his Lord</hi>; But the ſame Spirit, that in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, diſparaged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Maſter of the houſhold, will not be more kind to the family: but will make us, if he can, as he did the Apoſtles, luſtrating Sacrifices to expiate for the City, and a ſtrange ſpectacle both to Angels and to men.</p>
               <p>But (<hi>Secondly</hi>) Theſe projecting men that come to you with inſpired Doctrines, till they kill and ſlay and take poſſeſſion, will gloze over their falſe principles with all poſſible art and cunning; there ſhall be no Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt the perſon of a Prince, when it is their pleaſure firſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him; and if he come to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100880:56"/>
end, they kill the man but not the King, and all ſhall be, not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but, the execution of Juſtice, when they ſentence him by a Church-authority ſuperiour to his own: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion then is a juſt vindication of their own right, and they only break their Sovereigns Scepter, that Chriſts alone may be exalted: The murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoſe that have Sacred Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters impreſs'd upon them, is taking him that hindereth, out of the way, and all the uſurping Tyrannies in tne world, are exerciſed only to bring in ſuch a bleſſed confuſion, that ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious men may from the ſpoils of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, build their own Neſts on high, and this ſhall be called, <hi>the ſeating the Lord Jeſus on his Throne,</hi> though his Religion be made their own footſtool: But if they find the eyes of men open, or their ſtomachs too nice to digeſt ſuch hard things as theſe; and that they refuſe to embrace Devils when the flames appear through their thin garments, and they are not cut long enough to hide their cloven feet: They will effect by ſtratagem what they cannot by open force, and an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh ſhall deſtroy what a Field-Army
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:100880:56"/>
cannot: They will hide their leaven in ſome meaſures of meal, till in the end all is leavened; blend truth and error together, and like the <hi>Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks,</hi> make a Religious mixture that ſhall have ſomething of the Jew and ſomething of the Chriſtian, that may look like what others profeſs, but ſtill add ſomething of their own, that poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may be ſwallowed in a ſweetned potion, where men may take, and yet never taſte it: The <hi>Saducees</hi> could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Reſurrection from the dead, and yet adhere to the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi>: The <hi>Phariſees</hi> could admit the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, and yet void them by their own Traditions: The <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> could own Chriſt to be the Saviour of the world, and yet grant him only to be a Creature; And the <hi>Socinians</hi> can acknowledge him the Redeemer of mankind, and yet deny him to be a God by nature: And amongſt all theſe, and many more, error is entertain'd for the ſake of thoſe truths that cover it; and, not diſtinguiſhing betwixt the precious and the vile, men often receive them both together: The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts profeſs the Apoſtles Creed, but add as many Articles of their own:
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:100880:57"/>
And thoſe that are averſe to theſe, will yet embrace many errors, and are the more eaſily led towards them when they are diſperſed amongſt a great many truths: But when we conſider, that one mouthful of peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential Air may infect and deſtroy the man, it is but reaſonable all ſhould be wary in chooſing out wholſom habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; and ſince a little poyſon may make us ſwell and burſt aſunder, this may be more effectual to deſtroy, than all the food we ſwallow with it can be to ſave and preſerve us in full ſtrength and vigour; and by how much the more difficult it is to diſcern it, the more careful we ought to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Falſe Prophets, will be more difficult to be diſcerned, and therefore more ſtrictly to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by us, becauſe they will make their erroneous Doctrines to receive a ſeeming countenance from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures: Theſe are what we own to be our Rule, and by theſe we judge of Doctrines and Opinions, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are unwilling to believe that to be falſe, which many Texts are brought to prove: Thus the Devil tempted
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100880:57"/>
our Saviour, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 4.6.), when he would attempt the ruine of mankind, and the diſappointment of our Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; nay, of the whole moſt bleſſed and glorious Trinity, in contriving and carrying on ſuch wonderful provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by perſwading him to caſt himſelf down from the Pinnacle of the Temple, to make him ſin in the deſtruction of himſelf, and anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that death upon the Croſs, by which he was to become our Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, he might tempt Providence and hazard himſelf: <hi>If thou be the Son of God</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>caſt thy ſelf down; for it is written, He will give his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels charge over thee, and with their hands they ſhall bear thee up, leſt at any time thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone</hi>; rendering the Text plauſible to his purpoſe, by omitting that part of <hi>keeping him in all his wayes:</hi> But this was ſuch a tryal of skill, as rendered the Devil exceeding fooliſh, becauſe he that knew all things, could not be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of what he had omitted, which was the key to open that promiſe. Yet from this attempt of the Devil upon our Saviour, have the deceivers of mankind throughout all Ages en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100880:58"/>
to inſinuate falſe Doctrines into the belief of others, by bringing Texts of Scripture to prove them: The inſtances are many and well known to thoſe that are converſant in Books and Writings, or have given themſelves the variety and temptation to hear men of different opinion from us: But alas! How eaſie is it for one of no extraordinary skill, to wreſt the Scriptures, both to his own, and others ruine? Nay, S. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, that it is the common guilt of the unskilful and unlearned: (2 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3.16.): How much more then may deſigning men, that by guile endeavour to catch the ignorant, this way impoſe upon their underſtandings, by pretending Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, to prove and countenance their falſe opinions: eſpecially among ſuch as admit Texts for the ſake of their number, not their weight, and more regard the ſound of the words, than the ſenſe which is couched under them? 'Tis no difficult matter to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake the ſenſe of any Writing, and then to plead it according to our own purpoſe and deſign: Nor is it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for men to quote divers Texts, that to ignorant men, may, by their
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:100880:58"/>
ſound, ſeem to countenance their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that in their true meaning are nothing for them, or elſe confirm a contrary propoſition: This the Papiſts and Diſſenters know; and this we are acquainted with our ſelves, when we view Books whoſe Margins adorn them with multitudes of Texts, which they pretend to prove the ſame thing by, and yet, upon a more ſtrict exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, do not at all make for their purpoſe: And commonly when men multiply theſe beyond neceſſity, to prove what is certainly confirmed by few that are plain and pertinent, their Doctrine is either doubtful or falſe; or elſe they do it to take up time, and fill their diſcourſes which their own bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs cannot ſupply: Becauſe all Scripture, being of Divine Authority, if in any place it be plain and pertinent to the point which it is brought to confirm, one Text is as good as a thouſand; and to quote many, if ſome be impertinent, the whole poſſibly may be ſuſpected: And therefore 'tis not wiſdom to do it, but in points much controverted among Chriſtians; and in thoſe eſpecially for which the argument to prove them
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100880:59"/>
can be no other than Divine inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> cannot find (as they never can, and therefore deal in obſcure places, where the Text is as dark, as the places retired, into which they creep <hi>to lead ſilly women ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptive</hi>) I ſay if they cannot find plain Scripture to countenance their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they will yet pretend <hi>viſions</hi> and <hi>revelations</hi>; which the perfection of the Scriptures diſallows, nor have they any argument to prove them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides confidence and a bold preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Yet ſome are apt frequently to cry <hi>a Viſion from the Lord,</hi> when it is the fruit of their own phancies, whilſt their ſouls dream when their bodies ſleep, or are indiſpoſed whilſt they are awaked: We eaſily know how far the depraved diſpoſitions of our bodies work upon our minds, and how eaſie it is for men, proportionable to their melancholy or joy, to frame different opinions of things: (which by the way renders many ſigns of grace, that ſome men for their own advantage ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit to the world, altogether vain and deceitful). But, notwithſtanding all theſe things, we find, by too woful an
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100880:59"/>
experience, how men, either not fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or fearful, are prevail'd upon by ſuch pretenſions: So that it proves a difficult task to hinder their error, or to reduce them from it. For all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer rules, to thoſe that entertain ſo wild a principle, are ſet aſide; and Reaſon muſt not be heard againſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation: Yet ſince God is but one, and all Propoſitions are true or falſe; ſince we find different, nay, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Opinions vented to the World, under the ſame pretence, 'tis an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment why we ſhould <hi>prove</hi> and <hi>try them</hi>; and the rather by how much the more difficult true inſpiration is to be diſtinguiſhed from that which is falſe, and what comes from God to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd from what proceeds from the conſtitution of our bodies, the variety of objects preſented to our ſenſe, or what the Devil injects into our minds, and thereby employes, and captivates our thoughts, and this way frames an Opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly, Falſe Prophets</hi> will give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents to what they deliver, with ſuch art and elocution, as may make great impreſſions on a multitude; and ſuit their voice to the conſtitutions of thoſe
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100880:60"/>
whom they deſign to delude, with ſuch elevations and cadencies as may agree with the joyful, and the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly; as if a man muſt firſt be skill'd in Song, before he is capable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Preacher; or a Fidler were in the next capacity to be a <hi>falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> to delude the World; But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe ſuitable percuſſions upon the nerves of men, to make a grateful reception in the underſtanding; They add to it a great deal of their own paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which many miſtake for a true zeal, they can be loud when they are not rational, and what is wanting in ſenſe, they can ſupply by noiſe; and great action ſhall paſs for an argument; and a goggle of the eye for clear demonſtration: They will put their blood and Spirits into ſuch nimble motions, that they will ſeem as if they were raviſhed from themſelves, and the parts of their bodies were juſt running away from one another. This ſtrange fury is called zeal, and many men are apt to receive every thing for true, which is thus recommended by a Religious fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; not thinking that zeal is determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by its object, and according to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:100880:60"/>
what it is converſant about, becomes either good or bad. With what zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous acclamations and repeated out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries did the <hi>Jews</hi> call for the crucifixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Saviour, <hi>whilſt they tried, ſaying, Crucifie him, Crucifie him</hi>; (Luke 23.21.): and the more <hi>Pilate</hi> endeavoured to releaſe, the more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous were they to put him to death, and more inſtant in requiring his blood. In this, men of falſe and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Principles exceed thoſe that are poſſeſs'd of true; truth being uſually conveyed with ſimplicity, becauſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and underſtanding receives and fortifies it; but Error muſt be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by art and cunning, becauſe its nature cannot recommend it: We read of men, in the 7<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> that though they devoured their Kings and Judges, ſtrayed away into the Groves and Woods, from the Worſhip of God to that of an Idol; ſo that none (ſayes God) <hi>calleth upon me, yet they were as hot as an Oven.</hi> And thoſe <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> mentioned by <hi>Jeremiah, that ſpake peace to thoſe that deſpiſed their Maker, and to ſuch as walk'd after the ſtubbornneſs and imagination of their own hearts</hi>; ſaying, <hi>No evil ſhall come upon

you</hi>; were eager to deliver what they had no Commiſſion to do, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding zealous to publiſh the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of which God refuſed to be the Author; <hi>I have not ſent theſe Prophets</hi> (ſayes God) <hi>yet they ran: I have not ſpoken to them, yet they propheſied,</hi> (Jer. 23.21.). So that we may be eaſily deceived, if we are drawn into our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief by the heat and eagerneſs of thoſe that endeavour to impoſe upon us, if we have no other way to difference a fire that warms and relieves, from that which will both ſcorch and burn us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly, Falſe Prophets that go abroad into the world,</hi> will frequently boaſt the number of themſelves, and ſtartle men with the glory and multitude of their proſelytes. But <hi>Egypt</hi> had many Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians and Sorcerers in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> time that could confront the Rod of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and boldly vye Miracles with <hi>Moſes: Baals Prieſts were four hundred and fifty, and the Prophets of the Groves four hundred:</hi> and what proportion could <hi>Elijah</hi> bear to ſuch a multitude as theſe? The <hi>Arrians,</hi> among the Chriſtians, were ſo numerous, that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſeemed to engage againſt
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100880:61"/>
the World; And the Papiſts boaſt an Univerſality, as well as Antiquity of their Church; Nay, the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> alſo tell us of their number, and take all opportunities to ſhew themſelves, in the greateſt and moſt formidable bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; Not only to put frights upon Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; but to gain beholders and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes too: <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> for ſuch ends as theſe, <hi>ſhall become friends; And Ephraim and Manaſſeh ſhall join together to make an argument from the increaſe of number, though Manaſſeh be againſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim, and Ephraim againſt Manaſſeh.</hi> And abundance of men (eſpecially ſuch as neglect to examine the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their Religion) are led on by company and example; they follow the Herd though to their own ruine, and will run on with the Flock or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey till the Fowler ſpreads his Net over them; Though arguing to the truth from the numbers that profeſs it, would for ſome time have concluded our Religion to have been falſe, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the cauſe both to <hi>Jews</hi> and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens; The <hi>Turk</hi> may yet boaſt the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Proſelytes, and the Devil brag that his name is <hi>Legion.</hi>

                  <hi>Seventhly, Falſe Prophets</hi> will often plead the ſtrictneſs of their lives, and will come with Holineſs written up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Foreheads, how little ſoever be in their hearts; They will often be very preciſe and ſcrupulous; and though they can <hi>ſwallow Camels, yet they will ſtrain at Gnats</hi>; they will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tender in ſmaller matters, that they may be thought ſuch as great ſins ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeize on; like the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in the Goſpel, they will <hi>pay tythe of Mint, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe, and Cummin, although they omit the weightier matters of the Law</hi>: None among the <hi>Jews</hi> were more outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grave and formal, than theſe; <hi>they made broad the Phylacteries,</hi> thoſe ſcrolls of Parchment, on which the Law was inſcribed, that they might be capable of more Texts of Scripture, than other mens, to ſhew their great opinion of the Law; they enlarged alſo the frin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of their Garments beyond the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of other men, that they might not only be badges of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction and ſeparation, but evidence them to be exceedingly Religious; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were commanded by God to be worn to remember them of the Law, as well as to difference the <hi>Jews</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:100880:62"/>
from other Nations, and to prevent Idolatry, as often as they look'd upon theſe <hi>Fringes, which the God of Iſrael com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to wear,</hi> (Numb. 15.38.). Scrupulous were theſe men in relation to all the circumſtances of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but they regarded not ſo much the ſubſtance of it, nor what theſe things were ordain'd to ſignifie and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. We read of ſome in the Apoſtles dayes, <hi>that had a form of Godlineſs, who yet denied the power thereof,</hi> (2. Tim. 3.4.). And this continues ſtill in the World, and will, ſo long as Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is capable of being vailed with hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, and one man cannot diſcern the inſide of another: 'Tis but being ſtrict in outward appearance, and a wicked man may be accounted a Saint; and if open and ſcandalous ſins be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, mens inſide may be full of rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs and corruption, and they be canonized ſtill: Thus the Devil may be taken <hi>for an Angel of light,</hi> if he can but hide his malice and his flames; And men may cheat their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, commit adultery, or ſecret mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if their actions eſcape the notice of others, and they make not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a ſpectacle to the world: This
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:100880:63"/>
the Miniſters of Sathan do, like him, acting deeds of darkneſs within, whilſt yet a Candle is hung out at their doors; that are earneſt for reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in other men, but do not at all reform themſelves; only they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to cover thoſe faults which yet they will not ſtrive to amend: If they bleſs God with their mouths, they care not if they blaſpheme him in their hearts, becauſe their buſineſs is not to recommend themſelves to God, but unto thoſe men whom they deſigningly delude: God himſelf complains of ſuch Atheiſtical hypocrites, that turn things upſide down, <hi>that ſeek to hide their counſel from the Lord, and their works are in the dark; They draw near me</hi> (ſayes God) <hi>with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me; but have remov'd their heart far from me,</hi> (Iſai. 29.13.). And there is yet ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe of lamenting the ſad ſtate of Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, who are ſtill beguiled with good words into ill practices, and under a pretence of Religion are drawn to renounce it. But yet in the midſt of ſuch vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Principles preached to the World with noiſe and confidence; with
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:100880:63"/>
great zeal, though little reaſon, (which therefore as an enemy ſome diſgrace and vilifie) they diſtract the minds of thoſe that are unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, diſturb the peace of all Society, both Civil and Religious, draw men into Hereſie and Schiſm, and every e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil work, and make them think thoſe Prophets inſpired with the breath of God, that ſwell only with their own paſſion, and diſgorge themſelves in fire and brimſtone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong mankind: And the Doctrines that cauſe theſe diſorders, they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage with ſuch art, and ſuch ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble applications, and have ſo many plauſible pleas to the World, by which they ſpread them with too much ſucceſs over the minds of men: That it muſt fully convince us of a neceſſity to uſe diligence in our enquiries, <hi>and to try the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits whether they are of God</hi>; and ſo much the more, becauſe <hi>many falſe Prophets are gone out into the world.</hi> And thus I have done with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and Reaſons why we ſhould examine the Doctrines of thoſe that come to preach Religion among us,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100880:64"/>
let their pretenſions of Authority be what they will; Though they ariſe as high as inſpiration, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Commiſſion to be from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>

               <p>I Proceed now to my ſecond Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular propoſed, about this duty of <hi>trying Spirits</hi>; And that is to give you ſome Directions how to know when Doctrines propounded, as coming from God, are indeed <hi>revealed from Heaven,</hi> and the Deliverers to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved as <hi>inſpired from above,</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to be entertained in the world. Now becauſe men are apt ſometimes to rely on falſe characters of trial; and there being ſeveral marks ſet up, by men of various humours and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, to guide them in their way to Heaven, by which they pretend they are able to direct themſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and try Doctrines and Opinions: I ſhall make ſome brief reflections on them, that no prejudice may remain to hinder us from embracing the true methods of trying mens Propoſitions in Religion; Eſpecially thoſe who
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:100880:65"/>
come with ſo great an authority as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration.</p>
               <p>And (1.) We meet with many in the world, who ſuppoſe what they call the Church, which they make as narrow and little as they can, to be either that into which they ultimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolve their Faith; or at leaſt to have ſuch Authority as to determine all points in Religion, and what rules are to be accepted as Divine, and therefore by her judgment all Spirits and Doctrines are to be tried, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. But this Guide will many times be uncertain; Nay falſe too, if a Society of men, called the Church, agree upon ſuch Principles as are erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous; which we find a thing not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, when our preſent experience may inform us, that <hi>Rome,</hi> which would be the only Church; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeparate Congregations in the World, who yet aſſume the honour of a Church, err in Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, and in many wayes of Diſcipline and Manners: And this is no wonder at all, when we conſider that a Church is a Society of men; and that every man is capable of error; and that all Councils are managed by
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:100880:65"/>
votes; and theſe many times are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven wrong, not only through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or inadvertency, but humour and intereſt ſo far prevail in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of many, that we cannot yield their determinations to be infallible: Eſpecially ſince we often find great Aſſemblies managed by the tricks and devices of a few, whoſe deſigns, being beyond the reach of the multitude, draw them by degrees into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to what, had they foreſeen, they would never have yielded. Were the promiſes, indeed, of an infallible direction from the Spirit of God, made to all ages of the Church, and tied to the Aſſemblies which Chriſtians call Councils; we could not reaſonably diſpute their determinations, but muſt obey them: But the promiſes of this nature being confined to the firſt plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Goſpel, that were to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh an infallible Rule to the world, and neither made, nor uſeful, to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Generations, but only to prove the certainty of the Goſpel, to which every Chriſtian is to ſubmit both his Faith and Practice, it being a rule in all things neceſſary to ſalvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The things now ordained by any Church,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:100880:66"/>
or Society of men (whatever authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they may claim above us) as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation, have neither ſtrength, nor authority, unleſs it may be declared that they may be taken out of holy Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And therefore General Councils may err, and have err'd in things pertaining to God, as our Church declares in the twenty firſt Article: 'Tis true indeed, the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> had the Oracles of God committed to them; They were, <hi>cuſtodes legis,</hi> the keepers of the Law: So the Church among the Chriſtians, has the Goſpel committed to her cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody, and has a power to determine in indifferent matters; To order all the circumſtances in Religion, for decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, order and edification; and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to reſtrain ſuch Controverſies as tend to make a Schiſm and ſeparation, and diſſolve that unity which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are frequently exhorted to keep: So that although the Church be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and keeper of Holy Writ, yet as it ought not to decree any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſame; So beſides the ſame, ought it not to enforce any thing to be believed for neceſſity of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: as our Church declares in her
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100880:66"/>
twentieth Article. I ſhall not deny, (nor could I without ſingular pride and Arrogance) but that Fathers and Councils, and all Congregations of holy and judicious Chriſtians, much more Biſhops and Governours of the Church, treating about a point in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, attempted to be introduced a new, or being old, is controverted in the world; are with great defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to be attended to: For every mans reaſon will urge this obligation to himſelf; That his own judgement is rendered ſuſpected, when it oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the common and united determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of perſons that cannot juſtly be reproached with want either of skill or honeſty; And 'tis ordinary for men to miſtruſt the ſight of their own eyes, when a multitude of others, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſame advantage, cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what a ſingle perſon pretends to ſee. And in Religious affairs, and ſuch matters as are of great moment, when perſons of learning, piety, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the holy Church of Chriſt, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble with ſolemnity, and have a real intention to employ, with all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and diligence, thoſe parts which God has bleſs'd, and encreaſed,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:100880:67"/>
to them by the advantage of a peculiar education and ſtudy, invoking a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine influence upon their endeavours to find out the truth and meaning of any difficult and controverted propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; We have great reaſon to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to the belief of what theſe ſhall deliver for truth; Unleſs the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be ſo apparent to us, upon ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent enquiry, that there is no cauſe of heſitation at all. This being the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate opinion of our own Church, we are oppoſed in it both by the <hi>Papiſt</hi> and <hi>Fanatick</hi>; The former aſſerts that <hi>major eſt autoritas Eccleſiae quam Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pturae.</hi> That the Authority of the Church is greater than that of the Scripture: And that <hi>Traditiones ſunt pari pietatis affectu cum Scripturis reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piendae:</hi> Their Traditions are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with the ſame affection and devotion as the Scriptures: And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the latter come not far ſhort of theſe; but as much confine (when it is in their power) the belief as well as practice of their members to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of their Aſſemblies; and little differ from the <hi>Roman</hi> infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the end and deſign: For if any Churches among our ſelves do yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100880:67"/>
as they have formerly declared, that the <hi>Kirk</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was to be the pattern of their Reformation; then I am ſure they expect the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, both in opinion and practice, to their Aſſemblies determinations, as a Popiſh Council do to their Canons; or the Pope himſelf to his Decrees: For to the Aſſembly held at <hi>Glaſgow</hi> (1638) they ſwore that for judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and practice, they would adhere to the Determination of it; though perhaps they knew not what it would determine. But to leave the perſons of thoſe that ſtretch the power of a Church beyond the Authority God has given her: There are three Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which plainly ſhew that any Church, or Council of men, cannot lay down any Propoſitions, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their utmoſt Authority from themſelves, that may be the ultimate Rules by which the Doctrines and Opinions of others are to be judged. (1.) Becauſe God to whom our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion relates, has appointed a rule that being ſuperiour to the inventions of men, muſt bind their fancies and opinions in theſe things, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their Faith with thoſe general
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:100880:68"/>
actions that are deem'd Religious. To what purpoſe were the Scriptures given to the World, if they were not to be Rules and Directions to men? Nay, God being the Creator of all things, and in reaſon claiming the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Sovereignty over the things which he has made; It is in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to impoſe what Laws he will upon the world; and 'tis moſt ſuitable to his goodneſs to reveal them: That men may not err for want of knowledge; nor their thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the will of their Maker: Now this he has done in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, which are ſufficiently autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by his own Sanction, in that Miracles attended their firſt publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which are, as it were, the Broad Seal of Heaven, that prove them Gods own Act and Deed, when they no way contradict the natural Notions, and the prime foundations of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of men: The Scriptures there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being thus given and confirmed to us, muſt either be our Supreme Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and an infallible guide in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion; or elſe they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd to no purpoſe, or to cheat and delude mankind: The former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:100880:68"/>
not with the wiſdom of God; and the latter would contradict both his goodneſs and his truth: All the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty then will be, whether this Rule is ſufficient to guide us in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and practice of Religion, ſo that we need not any new inſpiration, or any rules to be ſuperadded, beyond the ſence of Scripture it ſelf, to conduct men in their way to Heaven? And conſequently, whether we may by them judge of all Doctrines and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions without the help of the <hi>Roman</hi> infallibility, or what is the ſame in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dreſs, the unerring Spirit of the Enthuſiaſt? But admitting the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to be of Divine Authority, they themſelves are a ſufficient teſtimony of their own perfection, whilſt they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that they proceeded from Divine inſpiration, <hi>to be profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in righteouſneſs, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſh'd unto all good works,</hi> (2 Tim. 3.16.).</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) No Canons or Decrees, of whatever bears the name of Church, or Council, can be a Rule of trying Doctrines in Religion, ſo as to be ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate and Supreme; Becauſe all the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:100880:69"/>
concluſions and propoſitions of theſe, are themſelves the Doctrines and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of men, either with, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, the pretence of inſpiration; and all Doctrines are to be tried them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; For this muſt be included (as I have ſufficiently proved) in S. <hi>John</hi>'s direction, <hi>try the Spirits whether they are of God:</hi> That therefore which is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to an higher Tribunal, cannot be it ſelf the higheſt; nor what is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſolely to aid us in our trial and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of Opinions; nor the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Rule by which we muſt examine them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> If the Doctrines of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles of old, nay, of Chriſt himſelf, the Saviour of the World, were lyable to the examinations of men; (it being natural to mankind to try the truth of any Propoſitions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they believe them): Then, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, no aſſembly of men can now in reaſon pretend ſuch authority to impoſe their own Doctrines upon the World, as Rules for all to ſubmit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, without any farther examination: And, if they muſt be examined at all, it muſt be by ſomething of greater cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and authority in the World. Now
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:100880:69"/>
that the Prophets of old were to be tryed, whether true or falſe, is plain to any that will give themſelves lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to conſider, not only that, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, there could be no ſuch thing as a falſe Prophet in the determination of men, (true and falſe having the ſame evidence) but that God himſelf gave directions under the Old Teſtament how to know the one from the other; (<hi>Deut.</hi> 13.1. and <hi>chap.</hi> 18.22.), which rules had been vain and inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant, if, by theſe, men were not to try them. Hence is it, that thoſe that attribute great authority to Chriſtian General Councils, do not think their Canons obligatory (unleſs the things included in them bind antecedently, by their own nature, or a ſuperiour Law) till they are received in thoſe Nations and Churches to which they are ſent. (2.) As the Doctrines of the Prophets were to be examined, ſo were alſo thoſe of the Apoſtles: Hence was it, that S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily called to be an Apoſtle, God himſelf ſupplying him with Unction and Ordination, by giving him au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from Heaven; and our Saviour
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:100880:70"/>
deſcending by an apparition from the Clouds, to inveſt him with dignity and power: Hence it was (I ſay) that this great Apoſtle, in his Call dignified beyond his Brethren, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the <hi>Bereans (Acts</hi> 17.11.) becauſe they ſearched and examined his Doctrines, whether they were true or falſe, by thoſe Scriptures they had already received, and by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Doctrines with the Natural Religion of Mankind, with what our Saviour and other Apoſtles preached; and moſt probably with the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, that they might be aſſured, that what he delivered was conſonant to that which was there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited concerning the <hi>Meſſias:</hi> And therefore theſe were of more pliable, and ingenuous, and gentile tempers, than thoſe of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> who were more regardleſs of theſe concerns; as S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> comments upon this Text. (3.) The Doctrines even of our Saviour himſelf, (though <hi>never man ſpake like him</hi>) were lyable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination by thoſe that heard, before they entertain'd them: And certainly if any might recommend propoſitions
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:100880:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
upon his own authority, he might, who was the <hi>Wiſdom of the Father</hi>; in whom <hi>all fulneſs dwelt</hi>; Nay, the <hi>fulneſs of the Godhead</hi> was, as it were, incloſed in his own body: Yet he bids the <hi>Jews</hi> to <hi>ſearch the Scriptures,</hi> and to conſider how well his Perſon and his Doctrines agreed with the antient Predictions in relation to him; and, accordingly, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to receive, or reject, him: <hi>For theſe</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>are they which teſtifie of me; And in them ye think ye have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life: (John</hi> 5.39.) So that it is plainly evident, from the beginning, that no Doctrines, under pretence of what inſpiration ſoever, were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by men without examination: But, as thoſe of the Apoſtles were to be compared with what our Saviour delivered; his again to be meaſured, not only by his own divine authority, but this alſo was to be proved by the Law and the Prophets, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets themſelves by thoſe Rules which God had given to the <hi>Jews</hi> to judge by: So is there not reaſon, that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of men pretending to Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, under what authority ſoever they are publiſhed, ſhould ſtill be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined

by a ſuperiour Rule; even by what the primitive Planters of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion have left for our peruſal and direction, <hi>viz.</hi> the doctrine of Chriſt and his holy Apoſtles? which priviledge (whatever <hi>Romaniſts</hi> plead for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) to hide from, or deny to, others, is the greateſt cruelty and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion; Enough it is to render any doctrine ſuſpected, that thus hides and runs to corners, and avoids all the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of men: And we have great reaſon to miſtruſt thoſe who take away mens judgement of diſcretion, valuing them only like Beaſts that periſh, whilſt they are not perſwaded, but whip'd to their work, and many times cripled under their burden, when yet they know not what they carry. Thus I have (though more largely than my firſt thoughts deſigned) not only ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the uſe and authority of the Church in her Synods and Councils in the examination of Doctrines and Opinions, but ſhewed you withal, that as their Decrees are not infallible, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they the higheſt Rules by which we judge of the Doctrines of men: Had it been otherwiſe when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:100880:71"/>
came to plant his Goſpel, the infallibility of the <hi>Jewiſh Sanhedrim</hi> had juſtly condemned him for an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, and all the Chriſtian Religion deliver'd, and authorized, by him, had proved only a Fable and a Dream.</p>

               <p>THe moſt conſiderable Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that oppoſe this way of ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Churches Authority in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining points of Faith, ſeem to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be the <hi>Romaniſts:</hi> and therefore this Chapter will briefly confute their high pretences to a ſtrange Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by which they have introduced as ſtrange Doctrines into the Chriſtian Religion. And, indeed, there was never a Law, yet, ſo plainly penn'd, but that the inventions of men (who make it their buſineſs to render Laws, both Divine, and humane, ſubſervient to their Secular intereſts) will blunt its edge, and endeavour to make it their own property, by altering, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-urging its deſign. The ſame uſe has been made of Texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, by the two Opponents of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> enlarging, or diminiſhing, the Infallibility promiſed to the Apoſtles, that it may the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:100880:72"/>
better countenance their own preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Some reſtraining the promiſes expreſſing the holy Spirits miraculous aſſiſtance in the guiding the Sacred Pen-men of the Goſpel, to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; And others extending it to every man of their own perſuaſion, or at leaſt to the Miniſters and Elders of their Churches: I ſhall here therefore ſpend a few leaves to ſhew that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> can have no ground in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to build their infallible determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations on, nor any reaſon at all to maintain their infallibility.</p>
               <p>I know not how it comes to paſs that other Churches muſt forfeit their intereſts in the promiſes of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> may proudly arrogate them to themſelves; Or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſon why the right of others muſt ſneak or ſtoop to their bold uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations: As if their Church could not well be Head of the World, unleſs we allow it to have all the Brains too; and daſh them out of the Sculls of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to fill their head till their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings become incomprehenſibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, that all the race of Chriſtians in the world, may receive Rules only from them; and give up the natural
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:100880:73"/>
freedom of their minds to enlarge the Pope's Empire and Authority; As if they only were like the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, to whom were committed <hi>the Oracles of God</hi>; And theſe they might either keep to themſelves, or allow them to others as they ſee occaſion: This makes a reproof to them (like Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt a Prince) a crime ſo great, that nothing but death can ſufficiently expiate: Among them, 'tis but cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling any one Heretick, and a dreſſing him up with pictures of Devils, and preſently he is expoſed to the flames: And this is ſuch a Sovereign power of life and death, that it reaches not only the body, but the ſoul. Thus as ſome flea the truth, to prove it naked; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of declaring it, expoſe it: So o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers pretending to its ſafe cuſtody, permit none to underſtand it but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; And ſo the reſt muſt ſwallow a <hi>Serpent</hi> for a <hi>Fiſh,</hi> and eat <hi>ſtones</hi> inſtead of <hi>bread:</hi> As if impoſing cheats upon the World, were the beſt way to prove a man inſallible; and deluding others, were the only Argument to evidence, that we are not deceived our ſelves: This is the great ſecret of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, that does not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:100880:73"/>
ſilence Diſputes, but forbid Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: That does not only ſtop the mouths, but crack the skulls of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, taking away our judgement of diſcretion, and our choice, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſing men into Beaſts: And then they put the yoke upon us, and whip us on to toyl and drudgery; that their own Paſtures may be covered with Flocks, and their Valleys ſtand thick with Corn, whilſt the high Hills laugh and ſing. For if it be once ſuppoſed that their Church is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whatever they determine muſt be true; And when we have vow'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to them, 'twill be too late afterwards to make enquiry. A pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful way this is to reconcile men, when contradictions themſelves may thus meet, and at any infinite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance embrace, when the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> pleaſe to declare them true. If this one point be but admitted, 'twill be ridiculous to diſpute the reſt: For all the Articles muſt certainly be true, which a Church, has determined that cannot err: This is a new way, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to walk by faith, and not by ſenſe; to pull out our eyes that we may ſee the better; And inſtead of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:100880:74"/>
captivating our underſtandings to the obedience of Faith, to deliver up our reaſon to another man. This is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to enſlave our ſelves, when <hi>Chriſt has made us free</hi>; to entangle our necks in the yoke of bondage, and to leave the burden of the old Law, for the greater load and oppreſſion of a new: And to make our ſelves like gentle Beaſts, ready trapped and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd for others to ride us. Let the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> once be infallible, and then they become as omniſcient as <hi>Apollo</hi>; All their determinations are <hi>ex Tripode</hi>; And we muſt then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as ſilent as in the Grave, and make our ſelves a prey to theſe Worms: We muſt kneel down at the Popes feet, and make our ſelves fit to be trod upon. But our reaſon is ſo properly our own, that as no man has a right over it, ſo is it ſtrongly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified within us, that none is able to take it from us, unleſs we will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it up our ſelves: If we will ſuffer the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> to deprive us of our ſtrength, and put out our eyes, they will certainly, then, make ſport with us; And if we yield ſo great a Point, as they unjuſtly challenge from the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:100880:74"/>
Old Teſtament, and the New, we deſerve, then, to be made a Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, when they have no reaſon to prove their Authority, but becauſe they have a mind to rule, and we become ſuch fools as to obey: <hi>The Prophets then may propheſie falſely, and the Prieſts bear rule by their means, when the people ſhall love to have it ſo; and what will you do in the end thereof?</hi> (Jer. 5.31.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seneca</hi> ſayes, of men that are curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous about trifles, <hi>operoſe nihil agunt (De brev. vitae cap.</hi> 13.) that they are very induſtrious about nothing; and though the ſtudying of many of our Modern Controverſies, is like an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours locking himſelf into his Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, that he may be very buſie in catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Flies; and we may ſay of ſome great Controvertiſts in the world, what <hi>Seneca</hi> ſayes of thoſe that took abundance of pains to find out a few unprofitable experiments; that by this they did not appear more learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but troubleſom, <hi>(Vid. ut ſup.)</hi> Yet when, by admitting a Principle, our reaſon is deſtroyed, and our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in an eternal hazard, by being at the devoir of another altogether as
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:100880:75"/>
fallible as our ſelves; and of whoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty we cannot alwayes be aſſured: We muſt then rally our Arguments to reſiſt, or ſuffer our ſelves to be led into ſlavery. That there is not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a foundation from any Text, for the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> pretended Infallibility, nor any Argument grounded upon reaſon, I ſhall endeavour briefly to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear: And therefore we may, yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve our ſelves to be men, and the Pope himſelf to be no other.</p>
               <p>Becauſe (1.) There is no abſolute promiſe of intire Infallibility, made to men in the whole Book of God; but only with limitation and reſtriction. I readily grant that there are promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Infallibility in ſome Texts; But theſe were made good in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and the ſeventy Diſciples; And yet though delivered in general terms, they are to be reſtrained not only to the perſons to whom our Saviour ſpake; but to things neceſſary for them to know, in relation to that end for which they were inſpired: And theſe were only ſuch truths as our Saviour deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to be the ſtanding rules for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity to guide themſelves by, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to their eternal welfare: This
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:100880:75"/>
is plain both from the latter part of the Verſe, of which the promiſe of the <hi>Spirits guiding into all truth,</hi> (Joh. 6.3.) is the former; And from the compariſon of this Text with another; In the Verſe of which this Text is a part, we have this added to confirm the promiſe, leſt any ſhould think the revelation of the Spirit ſhould not prove equally certain with the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our Saviour: <hi>He ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf, but whatſoever he ſhall hear, that ſhall he ſpeak: Whatſoever he ſhall be commiſſioned to inſpire you with, that ſhall he communicate unto you:</hi> Which is ſtill included in theſe two particulars; (1.) In what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelf had delivered to them; Or (2.) In what he ſhould ſuggeſt to them, to make their defence <hi>before Kings and Rulers,</hi> which need not at all concern them, whoſe ignorance in the Laws might cauſe them to fear; <hi>becauſe the Holy Ghoſt ſhould teach them, in the ſame hour, what they ought to ſay,</hi> (Luke 12.11, 12.). This only is ſuperadded; <hi>And he will ſhew you things to come:</hi> Which muſt either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the <hi>Gnoſtick</hi> defection, and the perdition of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:100880:76"/>
had predicted, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 24.). Or elſe to the Spiritual nature of Chriſts Kingdom, which the Apoſtles were ſo prejudiced againſt, to inform them, that this, with ſome other things, which they could not bear whilſt he was with them in the fleſh, they ſhould at laſt be ſatisfied in, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 10.12.). Or elſe it muſt include thoſe predictions of Prophets, more frequent in the Primitive times of Chriſtianity; ſuch was that of <hi>Agabus,</hi> (Acts 11.28.), who foretold the Famine that ſhould come to paſs in the dayes of <hi>Claudius Caeſar:</hi> And that prediction of S. <hi>Pauls bonds</hi> and <hi>impriſonment,</hi> (Acts 21.11.): All which conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, brings the promiſe of the Spirit, and infallibility, to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, under determinate reſtraints and limitations. But (2.) This will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appear, if we compare the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of <hi>guiding into all truth,</hi> with that other, relating to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> (Joh. 14.26.); where the Apoſtles are told, <hi>that he ſhould teach them all things,</hi> (more plainly thoſe which our Saviour had delivered) and bring thoſe things to their memory which they might forget, though before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared:
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:100880:76"/>
                  <hi>He ſhall teach you all things,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>and bring all things to your remembrance, whatſoever I have ſaid unto you.</hi> So that it appears that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had not the <hi>Spirit without meaſure</hi>; though they may be ſaid, <hi>to be filled with the Holy Ghoſt</hi>; And that this promiſe of infallibility to them, was made in a limited and reſtrained ſenſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Suppoſing the promiſes of Infallibility were made in never ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged a ſenſe, yet they are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to the perſons to whom they were at firſt made, as to the unerring conduct: and I might eaſily make it appear, that they cannot in their full ſence concern any but the Apoſtles themſelves, and the firſt Preachers of the Chriſtian Religion: Becauſe the end of this extraordinary inſpiration was to make them capable of preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing to us an infallible and unerring rule; Which being accompliſhed, there is no farther occaſion of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible inſpiration. For to what end ſhould this be continued to one, or a certain number of men, unleſs they were, upon new emergencies, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver new Doctrine to the world? If
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:100880:77"/>
it be neceſſary to the underſtanding of what has been already preſcribed; the Laws of the Goſpel will not only want one of the moſt excellent qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a Law, that it be plain and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily intelligible; But the ſame neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will argue infallibility uſeful to all, which renders it thus neceſſary unto ſome: For if it be therefore neceſſary to ſome, that they may become Guides to others; Since their conduct, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation unto others, muſt conſiſt in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and declaring that ſence of the Law, which could not be underſtood without them; (all which muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by word or writing) every man has as much need of infallibility that he may not miſunderſtand the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, as any have to prevent their miſapprehenſions of the Law, if there can be no peace without infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Now that all men have not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility is as readily yielded, as it is to be proved that the Pope has none.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If there were, now, this infallibility amongſt men, there muſt be a perpetual revelation: For, if the perfection of the humane nature could here render any men infallible, we
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:100880:77"/>
may well conjecture that many might have been in every age, that might have been Directors to the reſt: Or if it had been founded in humane nature, why ſhould not an equal perfection render all mankind infallible? Either of them being granted, will invalidate the neceſſity of a Divine Revelation; and turn the word of God into a ſtory; and <hi>do deſpight to the ſpirit of grace</hi>; if rendering it uſeleſs and a fable will do it; For to what end ſhould any men be inſpired, when they were, before, infallible in themſelves? The infallibility therefore, which we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of muſt proceed from a ſtrong, and certain, inſpiration; And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is delivered by vertue of this, is of equal authority with the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures themſelves: And then none can be ſafe in his life, or fortunes, when ever any inſpired man makes it his pleaſure to take them away: Nay, if we are conſcientious, we muſt yield them up upon demand, <hi>leſt haply we may be found fighters againſt God.</hi> And this appears in the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves, as well as others taught by them; The more conſcientious any of them are, the more readily do they yield to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:100880:78"/>
the impoſitions of their ſuperiours; and, they have reaſon for it, if they think them to be abſolutely infallible. For no private evidence of a thing muſt ſubvert their faith in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches determination; and ſo much the more triumphant is their faith, by how much the more it captivates their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings: As it is ſo much the more meritorious, by how much the leſs it has of evidence; So the greater the Objections are that meet and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the Churches determinations, their faith is rendered the more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and full of victory: Let the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine then be never ſo wicked in it ſelf, or conſequences; the conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous believer of the point of <hi>Roman</hi> Infallibility, muſt neither ſee the one, nor the other; But renounce all the evidence of his reaſon, and if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion be, (as there is ſometimes) of his ſenſes too. For what evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence can reaſonably be attended to, that bears a teſtimony againſt that which is infallible? This then muſt be a ready method to change the nature of good and evil, and the eternal Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtamp'd upon our minds, if the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation proceeds from the <hi>Roman</hi>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:100880:78"/>
Chair. Nay, the nature of things need not be changed, if the Pope pleaſe to change their names: Men may borrow then, and never pay, if he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to cancell the debt; Ruining fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and overturning Kingdoms will become noble, and a glorious exploit; Nay, religious acts, when he is at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to adopt them into the number: Burning Cities, and murdering Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſhall be accounted means of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating the Goſpel, if he pleaſe once to determine, that <hi>we may do evil, that good may come of it</hi>; And blowing up the Eſtates of Kingdoms is preſently holy, if he will but ſanctifie the Powder, and Canonize the man that has the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to attempt it: So powerful is this Doctrine of <hi>Roman</hi> Infallibility, that it can change the Devil into an Angel of Light: And, let the Pope himſelf be never ſo wicked, his determinations are all true and good, and he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main his Holineſs ſtill: He may ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert by degrees, or all at once, the whole Doctrine of Chriſtianity, (though from thence he receives his pretenſions of authority) if he pleaſes to declare it a Fable, when it ſhall no longer comport with his advantage;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:100880:79"/>
Nay, he has already ſo blended it with the Religion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and practice of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> that Chriſtianity is ſo buried in an heap of rubbiſh, that 'tis an hard matter to gather it up out of ſuch a great confuſion of ruines: The ſubſtance is loſt in the midſt of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; internal devotion is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by a pompous Scene of Page<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antry and Shew; and yet the evidence of our ſenſes muſt be rejected in the Doctrine, which they ſo much applaud in practice.</p>
               <p>And yet (<hi>Fourthly</hi>), Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the <hi>Roman</hi> pretences to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility; If there are any promiſes made of it, they do as well concern other Churches as themſelves: For if theſe promiſes were made to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in general (as is very plain from the circumſtances of their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very) if they were not terminated in them, but reached alſo the whole ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of thoſe by vertue of whom Chriſts promiſe was made good, of <hi>being with the Apoſtles, alwayes, to the end of the world</hi>; Then either all Churches muſt be infallible or none; eſpecially all that are able to derive their ſucceſſion from any Apoſtle, or
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:100880:79"/>
Apoſtolical men that were once Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and preſided there: And if ſo, then the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> muſt be infallible, becauſe S. <hi>James</hi> the leſs was appointed their Biſhop, either by our Saviour himſelf, (as ſome ſay) or elſe immediately by the Apoſtles (as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.). The Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> becauſe this was the Biſhoprick of S. <hi>Mark,</hi> muſt become as infallible as that of <hi>Rome</hi>; That of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> becauſe founded by S. <hi>Andrew</hi>; That of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> becauſe S. <hi>John</hi> was ſeated there. Nay thoſe, alſo, of <hi>Smyrna, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia</hi> and <hi>Laodicea,</hi> becauſe this Apoſtle laid the foundations of them: Nay, and our own Church of <hi>Britain</hi> too (which our adverſaries will hardly yield in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible) becauſe <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Zelot</hi> preached here, wrought many Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and at laſt ſuffered Martyrdom for the Faith of Chriſt, and our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Soil has the honour of his Bones; if the <hi>Greek</hi> Menologies may obtain any credit amongſt men. But to bring this buſineſs nearer to an head: If this infallibility will not be allowed to all Churches of the Apoſtles planting, nor to thoſe over which they more
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:100880:80"/>
eſpecially preſided, (as they certainly will never yield it, whoſe intereſt it is to keep it unto themſelves); Yet why ſhould not <hi>Antioch</hi> become infallible, which was a Church of S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s planting at leaſt ſeven years before he came to <hi>Rome?</hi> Muſt the elder Siſter become a fool, that the younger may appear infallible? Or muſt we deny the priviledge of <hi>Antioch,</hi> becauſe it would invalidate that of <hi>Rome?</hi> The latter ſeems their moſt probable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture; though 'tis eaſily proved S. <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Antioch,</hi> but eagerly diſputed, whether ever he was at <hi>Rome.</hi> But allowing S. <hi>Peter</hi> to have been at <hi>Rome</hi>; and not only ſo, but to have been Biſhop there, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Pope to be his Succeſſor, (which yet is hard for them to prove, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when the Succeſſion is to be traced through their Anti-Popes, and Pope <hi>Joan</hi> muſt become an Holy Father too), How came this promiſe of infallibility to be fixed only upon S. <hi>Peter,</hi> when it was ſpoken to the whole Apoſtolical College? If you will ſay, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility can be fixed but in one; and that we may as well diſcourſe of many Omnipotents, as many Infallibles:
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:100880:80"/>
(and certainly 'tis to be proved with equal ſucceſs, were the infallibility not capable of reſtraint) Yet why muſt it be fixed upon S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and not on any other of the Apoſtles? S. <hi>Paul,</hi> though a later Apoſtle, has as much to plead for a ſettlement of it upon the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as ever S. <hi>Peter</hi> to fix it upon the <hi>Jews.</hi> Nay, the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have greater reaſon to derive it from S. <hi>Paul,</hi> than ever they had for deriving it from S. <hi>Peter</hi>; Unleſs they acknowledge themſelves to ſucceed the Circumciſion, of which S. <hi>Peter</hi> was only Biſhop. But perhaps they will plead Infallibility from Supremacy: and afterwards (if occaſion ſerves) plead Supremacy from Infallibility again. Yet ſtill S. <hi>Paul</hi> will bid as fair for the Supremacy too, if we take time to examine his Plea. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was not only deſigned to his Apoſtleſhip by the Grace of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had any merit in himſelf, being a choſen Veſſel to bear Chriſt's Name amongſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> when he was appointed to his Office from his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Womb, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 1.15.); But his Converſion was attended with Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and from a Perſecutor, when the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:100880:81"/>
deſign was laid, and his malice big againſt the Chriſtian Church, he was ſtruck down with a dart from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and convinced by that Light which made him blind: He was brought to this Religion with Pomp and Ceremony, and uſhered into the Church with a train of circumſtances that were Heralds to his honour, and proclaimed him great (<hi>Acts</hi> 9.): Nor was he greater in his Apoſtleſhip, than in his ſufferings: For, after a large Catalogue of his miſeries (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.), he made the Tragedy compleat by his death: He was thrown into Priſon with S. <hi>Peter</hi>; And (if <hi>Baronius</hi> may be credited) the Pillars are yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, at which they were both bound and ſcourg'd: And had he not been a <hi>Roman,</hi> he might have been crucified with S. <hi>Peter:</hi> But being ſuch (like a Perſon of Honour) he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed: In the time he lived he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured more abundantly than the reſt of the Apoſtles; (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10.): Nor was he in any reſpect behind the very chief of them (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.5.): He neither yielded to the argument of intereſt, when he received his firſt conviction; nor did he, when he was
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:100880:81"/>
baptized or illuminated from above, and by inſpiration had received a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Commiſſion to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, go to derive his authority from the Apoſtles, as if he had been inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our unto them; But he ſtraightway preached Chriſt in the Synagogues; though to the amazement of all that heard him (<hi>Acts</hi> 9.20, 21.): He was not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, though his former zeal another way, might be and was objected to him; And, that he might ſufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the truth, and the honour, of his Apoſtleſhip, he went into the untrod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den paths of the World, where none had adventured to preach the ſame Doctrine before him: <hi>For ſo</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>have I ſtrived to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, not where Chriſt was named, leſt I ſhould build upon anothers foundation, (Rom.</hi> 15.20.): All this we have drawn into a narrow compaſs (<hi>Gal.</hi> 1.16, 17.); <hi>But it pleaſed God, who ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated me from my mothers womb, and called me by his grace, to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; Immediately I conferred not with fleſh and blood; neither went I up to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>to thoſe which were
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:100880:82"/>
Apoſtles before me.</hi> As he was moſt juſtly ſtiled <hi>The Apoſtle of the Gentiles</hi>; For the care of all their Churches lay upon him, (and I hope the <hi>Romans</hi> were not then <hi>Jews</hi>; let them be what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they will ſince) and came more upon him every day (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28.). He oppoſed the principal Officers of the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and gave no place by ſubjection, no not for an hour, ſince they that ſeemed to be ſomewhat, added nothing in conference to his knowledge; but perceived him to be appointed the <hi>Apoſtle of the Gentiles,</hi> as well as S. <hi>Peter</hi> was the <hi>Apoſtle of the Jews</hi>; when they came to <hi>Antioch,</hi> he <hi>withſtood Peter to the very face, becauſe</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>he was to be blamed,</hi> for that both he himſelf had diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the <hi>Jews,</hi> and had perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> into the ſame compliance; And, upon the whole, neither of them <hi>walked according to the truth of the Goſpel</hi>; And all this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference was upon no ſmaller point than this, that <hi>a man is not juſtified by the works of the Law, but by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt, (Gal.</hi> 2.): 'Tis plain S. <hi>Paul</hi> had here, in a proper ſenſe, the <hi>right hand of fellowſhip</hi>; not only in
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:100880:82"/>
that they admitted him into the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of the Apoſtles; but they gave him the preheminence among them: And S. <hi>Peter</hi> had a great deal of reaſon to do it, if a Scholar ought to reſpect his Inſtructor: For 'tis plain, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> informed him in a point that he knew not, or diſſembled before; though he knew enough to be the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of the Circumciſion,</hi> a Province, to which he was then deſigned: ſo that the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> claiming Supremacy from S. <hi>Peter,</hi> will add no great proof to their infallibility; nor this be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently evinced by the derivation of their ſucceſſion from him: Unleſs the ſecond Chapter to the <hi>Galatians</hi> be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed out of the Sacred Canon; Or the denyal of a juſtification by faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ceremonial works of the Law, becomes a point, in the determination of which, infallibility is not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned: Or elſe 'tis lawful for them to reject this authority of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> if they ſtill embrace the doctrine of S. <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Suppoſing there had been an infallibility made to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and from him derived to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; yet what ſhall we now do for directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? ſince neither they nor we know
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:100880:83"/>
where to find it, upon a diligent ſearch into their own opinions of it. For ſome place it in a General Council; ſome in the Pope and this together; ſome in himſelf and College of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals; and ſome again in the Pope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. If this Infallibility be placed in a General Council, it will be as eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſputed when it may be ſaid to be General; Some giving Councils ſo fair an Epithet, when others do as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently deny them to be ſuch: The infallibility therefore cannot be found here; Unleſs it remains in ſuch a Council, where all the circumſtances and qualifications can be found, that are able to give it ſuch a denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; When the intereſts of Princes and Churches ſhall be determined previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Aſſembly; and all are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed who ſhall ſummon it: And when this difficult (if not impoſſible) task is accompliſh'd; If they muſt all conclude in one opinion; I fear this can never be: Or if things muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the major Vote, and this makes infallible truth, how came the greater part to be infallible, when the leſſer number are ſo far from being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired at all, that they give their Votes
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:100880:83"/>
contrary to the truth? Nay, by ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Tables to a new point, many of thoſe may, by theſe rules, become infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible who, in another, had err'd juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: but if the approbation of the Pope muſt be added to the determination of the Council, the infallibility, then, will reſt in himſelf: Becauſe, if he pleaſes to be of a contrary opinion, he can make void the Votes of the Council, by refuſing to comply with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination; And conſequently they are not infallible in that which wants the Supreme evidence of the Popes aſſent. But, if after all this (ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their united concurrence) infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility ſhould not reſt in this Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; but in the Pope and his College of Cardinals; Then the Arguments for obedience to the General Council, taken from their infallibility in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining, are ſuperſeded by an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Authority; Though the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences obviate the infallibility of theſe, which do attend the former opinion: Finally, ſuppoſe that it reſts in the Pope alone: Then if it be his priviledge as a man, it will be the endowment of the reſt of mankind; And then they will need none of his
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:100880:84"/>
ſingle determinations: If he is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as he is Pope; Then, either all his Speeches are infallible, or elſe when he determines about matters of Faith: If the former be true; Then he cannot poſſibly deceive; And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, he would not prove ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſucceſsful, a Stateſman as he is, if he could not ſometimes diſſemble his opinion: If the latter poſition be affirmed to be true; Then either all his Propoſitions concerning Faith, muſt be infallible, and there is no diſputing with him; Nor is it lawful for him at any time to oppoſe in a School que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, where the Orthodox part is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually held by the reſpondent, for fear his Propoſitions ſhould become infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, and truth be rendered incapable of being held; Or elſe he becomes only infallible, when he is gravely ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and determines from his Chair; And if this be the caſe of us mortals; We muſt not only ſtay for reſolution, till he is dreſs'd and cloath'd in all his Robes, and Pontificals, any of which (for ought I know) being wanting, he may fail in his determination, and our Faith fail for want of ſome Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial accoutrement: But ſuppoſing
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:100880:84"/>
all this to be done, if he cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible till he is in his Chair; Then the Chair ſeems more infallible than himſelf: Yet when all this is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed (for ought we know, or ever can) he may not be a lawful Pope: For if he be unbaptized, he cannot be a Prieſt; and if he is no Prieſt, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a Pope; And if the intention of the Prieſt that Baptized him, and of the Biſhop that gave him the order of Prieſthood, be required to make both valid; If, at his Baptiſm, he met with an untoward Prieſt; Or, at his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, with an ungodly Biſhop, that performed the Ceremonies, without minding what they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, ſuſpending their intention, at thoſe times, either through malice, or inadvertency, or deſigning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the whole buſineſs is ſtill ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; And the Chair will not beſtow infallibility upon one that is indeed no lawful Pope. But what ſhall we think of the Anti-Popes, when two are choſen, (as it has been poſſible) and they both ſtruggle for the Chair, where reſts the infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity then? Or what becomes of it in the interval betwixt the death of the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:100880:85"/>
laſt, and the Election of a new? Let even the Chair keep it for the next that ſhall poſſeſs it; And I wiſh it would alwayes ſit there, and never endeavour to trouble us: If they will periſh in their own folly, I know no help, being quite tired with expoſing their Opinion. Upon the view of the whole, we ſee the Propoſition is made good, that, ſince their own Opinions are ſo different about the Seat of Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility, neither they, nor we, know where to find it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> If there were this infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and they had agreed where to fix it; ſo that they are ſure they once knew how to find it: Yet it plainly appears that it is now loſt; ſince their whole Church has determined, and yielded to many things plainly er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous; and quite oppoſite to the authority of the Scriptures: I ſhall at preſent only inſtance in three, though I might produce a Catalogue of more. The (1.) <hi>Is the taking away the Cup from the people.</hi> (2.) <hi>Prayer in an unknown tongue.</hi> (3.) <hi>The Doctrine of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I inſtance in <hi>taking away the Cup, in the bleſſed Sacrament of the Lord's
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:100880:85"/>
Supper,</hi> from the people; as an error determined by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> By <hi>Cup,</hi> I mean the Sacramental Cup, and not that of Ablution, by which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have ſhifted from the doubts of ſome ignorant Objectors. Now that the detention of the <hi>Cup,</hi> (notwithſtanding all endeavours of an evaſion) is a palpable error, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent from the inſtitution of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour as recorded by all the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> that mention it in all the Goſpels where this is repeated: For as the eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al parts are always ſet down, ſo we have preſcribed <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> which by a ſolemn conſecration, are bleſſed and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from common uſes, to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Chriſts <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> and in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate manner to repreſent Chriſt dead, and not united under one Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol; And to whomſoever he gave the <hi>Body</hi> repreſented by the <hi>Bread,</hi> the ſame perſon received the <hi>Blood,</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the <hi>Wine</hi> contained in the <hi>Cup</hi>; As it appears upon the view of Chriſts own inſtitution. If it be Objected (upon the grant of this, which none can deny) that the Apoſtles then only received; And that the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves allow it to the Prieſts: It
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:100880:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
may, from thence, with a greater co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour be argued, that the whole Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament ought only to be continued to the Clergy; And that the Laity ſhould not receive ſo much as a part; And then the argument will ſooner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of all, than any one part of it. But that I may totally invalidate this ſcruple, and, at the ſame time, prove the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to be erroneous; Let us view the inſtitution as repeated by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who has in this proved <hi>Rome</hi> to have err'd, and clearly frees us from their impoſture; Though S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſayes nothing of it; (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23.). <hi>I have received of the Lord, that which I alſo delivered unto you; That the Lord Jeſus the ſame night in which he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, took bread; and when he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thanks, he brake it, and ſaid, Take, eat, this is my Body which is broken for you, this do for a remembrance of me. After the ſame manner alſo he took the Cup, when he had ſupped, ſaying, This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood; This do ye as oft as ye drink it, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me:</hi> Now the whole deſign of this repetition of the firſt Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is to rebuke thoſe diſorderly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of the whole body of the Church
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:100880:86"/>
of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and to regulate all by the Inſtitution of our Saviour; And all together, as well people, as Clergy, are told, that as <hi>often as they eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, they ſhew forth the Lords death till he come.</hi> If this, then, is to be continued in the Church as a Memorial of Chriſts Death, till his coming again to judge the World, (which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will not deny): It muſt be an error thus to depart from the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Chriſt, and the ſucceeding practice of his bleſſed Apoſtles, (to ſay nothing of other Ages of the Church) to give to the people an half Communion, (which the Prieſts will not be contented with themſelves) and to deliver them only a part of the Sacrament. This, certainly, is ſuch an error, as does not only void their infallibility, but a crime too; Unleſs the greateſt Sacriledge be a vertue: And, in plain language, it certainly concludes that either the Scriptures or the the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> are not infallible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I inſtance in their Prayer in an <hi>unknown tongue</hi>; I mean a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage unknown to the people. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but wonder (if we had no directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:100880:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the Book of God concerning this matter) that any perſons ſhould be ſo ſtupid, as to petition from God they know not what, and to offer that under the notion of a reaſonable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which they do not underſtand: For how can that be preſented with Faith, which they know not whether it be ſuch as God will accept, and as becomes them to offer? The Prieſt here may curſe the people in the name of the Devil, when they think they are bleſs'd in the name of God: But not to proſecute any abſurdities con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequential to this irrational practice, beſides what the Scriptures mention, (deſigning not at preſent to handle theſe things at large): 'Tis a direct contradiction to that of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>Chap.</hi> 14, 15. and 16 <hi>Verſes</hi>). For the Apoſtle having laid down this general direction, that all things, in the publick Worſhip, <hi>ſhould be done to edification</hi>; He affirms, that <hi>praying</hi> and <hi>bleſſing</hi> in <hi>unknown tongues,</hi> did not accompliſh this end, (<hi>verſ.</hi> the 12<hi>th</hi> and 17<hi>th</hi>). (1.) Becauſe he that <hi>prayes in an unknown tongue,</hi> though he underſtands it himſelf, <hi>becomes unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable unto others,</hi> v. the 14. (2.) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:100880:87"/>
no man, that underſtands not, can give his aſſent, or breath forth a wiſh, by ſaying <hi>Amen,</hi> to a Prayer or Bleſſing, in an <hi>unknown tongue,</hi> ver. the 16<hi>th.</hi> And the Apoſtle, from the whole, inferrs this as a rule unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: <hi>That when he prays with the Spirit, (i. e.</hi> in an unknown tongue, which was then an immediate gift of the Spirit) <hi>he would pray with underſtanding alſo; (i. e.</hi>) ſo as he, underſtanding it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, might become fruitful unto others, by giving them its juſt interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that they who underſtood not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers languages, might be able to ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> when they were rendered into their own. So that it muſt be an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to enjoyn their publick Prayers to be made in an unknown tongue: Unleſs they will invalidate the Scriptures of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> by a blind and unwritten authority, from S. <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> They have loſt their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded infallibility, by determining that monſtrous and abſurd Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> It cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, when I introduce this point as a proof of another, that I ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiate upon all the abſurdities that
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:100880:88"/>
attend ſo prodigious a determination: As that the ſame Body may be in a thouſand places at once; that there may be admitted a penetration of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions; That a Body may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, where it was not before, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out changing its place; That the whole Body of Chriſt may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd within the ſmall compaſs, nay, in every little part, of a Wafer; That it may be eat every day, &amp; yet remain the ſame ſtill; That an irrational creature (a <hi>Mouſe</hi> for example) may feed upon the Body of our Lord; That one thing may be chang'd into another thing, which did exiſt before; That a Body may be in a place after the manner of a Spirit: Nay, that Chriſt may give his own Body to be eaten by his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, whilſt, yet, he remained alive, and entire at the Table. Theſe, and ſuch like, are the abſurd conſequences of Tranſubſtantiation, which men muſt ſwallow <hi>with the ſubſtantial Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> Sacrament of the <hi>Lords Supper:</hi> And they require too large a diſcourſe for me to expatiate upon each ſeverally, and apart. I ſhall therefore inſtance in one abſurdity, or rather a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:100880:88"/>
of great impiety, ſuch as deſtroys the authority of the Goſpel (if this Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation proves true, and is not an error): And that is; That it deſtroyes all the certainty of our ſenſes. For, if that which has the colour and appearance of Bread; That which my taſte informs is ſuch; That which by touching and handling of it ſeems to be Bread, by as great an evidence as can appear to my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, by the teſtimony of my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, concerning their own proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, where there is a true <hi>medium,</hi> and a juſt diſtance: If this, which thus ſeems to me to be Bread and Wine, may yet not be ſo; but the ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Body and Blood of our Lord: Then, I can have no ſufficient evidence that the Chriſtian Doctrine was revealed from Heaven. For the proof of this depending upon the certainty of thoſe Miracles which were at the firſt wrought for the confirmation of it. And theſe depending upon the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their ſenſes, who were then eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſe to the Miracles; And, if the ſenſes of all mankind may together be deceived about this Sacrament, the ſame poſſibility might make them ſo,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:100880:89"/>
when the Miracles were wrought to prove the Goſpel: And then we have no certainty of our Religion; but the whole Goſpel may prove a fable, and its greateſt confirmation be nothing but an impoſture. This is enough to make the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, to be introduced into the World, with pomp and ceremony, and to render it authentick, by an infallible authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. If it be ſaid that, in relation to the firſt confirmation of the Goſpel, our ſenſes were free, and then could not be deceived; But that now, ſince the Chriſtian Religion was ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly authorized, this very Doctrine thus confirmed, tyes up our ſenſes; ſince 'tis rational to ſubmit them to Divine revelation: I Anſwer; That, if the New Teſtament did, any where, thus impoſe upon the faculties of men; It would (1.) Be difficult, upon the ſame grounds, for me to believe that mine eyes were not impoſed upon, when I read the words. (2.) Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that I did read them true; And that were ſufficiently confirmed, that I underſtood what I read; Yet ſince no other Text can be pleaded for Tranſubſtantiation beſides, <hi>This
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:100880:89"/>
is my Body</hi>; Why muſt I, of neceſſity, underſtand that by theſe words I am commanded to believe contrary to my ſenſes; When, by a plain and eaſie conſtruction, agreeable to the uſual Sacramental phraſes, particularly thoſe which were uſed about the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeover, my ſenſes are ſtill left unto their liberty? And no more than ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> That is; This Bread repreſents, or ſignifies my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; will expreſs the ſence, and baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle the Objection. 'Tis ſo common to parallel this expreſſion, with <hi>I am the vine, the way, the door,</hi> and <hi>That Rock was Chriſt; This is my Covenant; This Cup is the New Teſtament,</hi> &amp;c. Where the Verbs are conſtrued by <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, ſignified,</hi> and the like; That I am aſhamed we ſhould be put to continued repetitions, by the daily appearance of a baffled Adverſary. Thus we ſee, by theſe three inſtances of erroneous determinations of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that, if ever they had infallibility, they have loſt it: Unleſs truth and error are reconciled, and infallible falſhood be a proper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:100880:90"/>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> If notwithſtanding all the premiſſes, the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will yet hold the concluſion, and affirm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be infallible; We muſt call upon them to prove it by Miracles. For this can no way become the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but by immediate inſpiration to thoſe that pretend it; And whoever pretends to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, ought to prove it by Miracle, when the Scripture does not command us to believe it. The Apoſtles proved their infallibility by Miracles: We muſt demand, therefore, the ſame from thoſe that will pretend to the ſame priviledge; Since the promiſes they challenge to themſelves, are complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Apoſtles. Nay, 'twill not be enough to tell ſtories inſtead of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; Nor to produce ſomething done among them, of which, the cauſe being behind the Curtain, no natural account can be given: But they muſt be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſuch circumſtances as may ſufficiently prove them to be Divine. And, when this is accompliſhed (which is impoſſible), the infallibility preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded muſt be proved neceſſary to the Salvation and conduct of men: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we ſhall doubt of the Miracles
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:100880:90"/>
themſelves, becauſe they confirm an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary thing, and what ſuppoſes the inſufficiency of the Scriptures. I might add more Heads of Argument; but theſe are ſufficient to baffle the ſtrength of this proud Capitol.</p>

I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that I have ſufficient leave from the Articles and Canons eſtabliſhed in the Proteſtant Church of <hi>England,</hi> for what I have already wrote concerning this matter: Yet I ſhall farther explain the ſame thing; to ſhew that I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to attribute as much Authority and Honour to the beſt eſtabliſhed Church in the World, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of it, as any man can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100880:91"/>
do who does not pluck out his eyes to do them ſervice. Therefore, notwithſtanding what has been ſaid of the <hi>Roman</hi> Infallibility; I readily yield that Fathers and Councils, and all Congregations of holy, and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Chriſtians, much more the Biſhops and Governours of the Church, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly aſſembled to treat concerning the truth or falſhood of any Point, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into Religion, are reverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be attended to; Reaſon urging a regard to thoſe who, by the advantage of ſtudy, or the proſpect they have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from an higher ground, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the age in which they live, are probably capacitated to aſſiſt our judgments, and to determine a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie better than our ſelves. When perſons of learning, piety, and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, alſo, in the Church of Chriſt ſhall aſſemble in his name, with a real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to find out the truth of any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, and diſputed, Propoſition, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly begging the Divine aſſiſtance, and bleſſing on their endeavours; We have great Reaſon to incline to their determinations, when neither ſecular intereſts, or a blind paſſion, or the force of others gains their Votes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:100880:92"/>
their aſſent. Nay, when theſe are our own lawful Governours, (though nothing can force our belief) we may, in an improper ſence, call their determinations infallible (<hi>quoad nos</hi>); Becauſe, for the peace and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, to avoid Schiſm, and to preſerve an Eccleſiaſtical union among us, it will be neceſſary that they bind us not to contradict them pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, by any external ſolemn act, ſince we our ſelves have our aſſent vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually implied in Canons or Laws made by thoſe who publickly repreſent us: Although we are not obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve every Propoſition, thus determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to be exactly true; Unleſs it be propounded to us with ſufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to convince our judgements, if we have abilities to enquire into the Proofs themſelves. To reſtrain the external acts and diſcourſes of men, when they oppoſe the publick Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and conſtitutions of thoſe who are fixed in ſuch places of Authority, is plainly neceſſary to keep peace and order in any Society; much more in ſuch a one as is purely Chriſtian, that we may be regular and uniform in our practice; and that there may be
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:100880:92"/>
no diviſions among us; And that the common Acts which we are to join in, as a Body or Society of Chriſtian men, may not be diſturbed by particular members withdrawing from them, or rendered indecent, or invalid, by noiſe, or confuſion. But yet there is no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation upon any man to reſign either his ſenſe or reaſon in any point of which he is a capable Judge; But only to captivate it to the obedience of faith in ſuch points as are apparently reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, though the points them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves may be above the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the faculties of men. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Authority can oblige us to contradict the Scriptures, in their ſtanding Laws of Faith and Manners; Becauſe theſe ought to be a Law both to our Governours and our ſelves, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently to the Laws and Canons of men. Hence is it that we reject the pretences of aſpiring men, to any abſolute and compleat infallibility, by virtue of any promiſe ſuppoſed to be made to the Succeſſors of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Apoſtles: Becauſe there is no ſuch promiſe made to any but the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and the firſt Writers and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhers of the Chriſtian Religion,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:100880:93"/>
whoſe Writings are to be our ſtanding Rules in all things abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Salvation: Nay, the end and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the firſt Divine and infallible guidance, was only to introduce a new Law, ſuperſtructed upon the Old Law of Nature, and to free Religion from the corrupt gloſſes and cuſtoms of men, who abuſing their Authority, had falſly impoſed things on others; To obliterate the old Ceremonial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions preſcribed to the <hi>Jews</hi>; To draw the <hi>Gentiles</hi> from their Heathen Idolatry, and to erect the Chriſtian Church among men, that all Nations might flock to it, be ſheltered in one Fold, <hi>being redeemed from the power of the deſtroyer,</hi> and feed together un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Government and conduct of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, the great Paſtor and Biſhop of our ſouls.</hi> Hence was it that our Saviour promiſed the immediate and infallible guidance of the Spirit to his Apoſtles, that, being before of meaner capacities, they might be able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his Laws ſo well as to publiſh them to the World, as the ſtanding Rules to all future Generations. But this rule being once compleated, by the informations which our Saviour
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:100880:93"/>
gave to his Apoſtles whilſt he was with them; And by the continued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations and aſſiſtances which they received from the holy Spirit, after his Aſcenſion into Heaven, to explain ſome things, and bring others to their remembrance, and to enable them to preach the Goſpel to the World, and to publiſh the Doctrines and Rules of it, in Writing, to be the ſtanding Law of Religion, to which all future ages might have recourſe for guidance, both in Faith and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: When this Law was fully and compleatly written, which was to be the great and only Rule of mens Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, there was no need of a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infallibility, to interpret what was ſo fairly written, that in things abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to Salvation, none but Ideots can poſſibly be miſtaken, and none but Knaves will endeavour to miſlead them. For there is no man, who has humility enough to uſe the help of the learned in Religion, and grace enough to implore the ordinary aſſiſtances of the Divine Spirit, (which God gives to thoſe that ask him) but, if he endeavours, with ſincerity, to live according to what he already knows,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:100880:94"/>
and faithfully, and honeſtly, applies his rational faculties, to the diligent ſearch of Divine truth, he ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly attain ſuch degrees and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancements of knowledge as <hi>ſhall be ſufficient to make him wiſe unto Salvation,</hi> if he does not too much ſtrive to be wiſe above what is written: And if after all this, he chance to fall into any error, through the naked infirmities of human nature, it ſhall be ſuch as will be conſiſtent with the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; nor will it be ſo ſeverely laid to his charge, as to be the cauſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning him hereafter, when it was not in his own power to help it. The Scriptures, certainly, were firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to be the Rule of Faith and Manners. And a rule ought to be ſo plain, that all, who are to take their meaſures by it, may be able, by ſome means or other, to compare their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and actions with the Rule, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to paſs a judgment upon the whole: Nay, if we reflect upon our own ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional powers, together with thoſe aſſiſtances we are directed to, and make uſe of theſe when we conſider the Scriptures themſelves, we muſt of neceſſity yield this to be true; Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:100880:94"/>
we will be perverſe and obſtinate in every thing. For if we think upon the quality of thoſe perſons to whom our Saviour and his Apoſtles ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed themſelves in their uſual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, we ſhall find that they ſpake not, in their Sermons, nor wrote their Epiſtles, only to the <hi>Rabbins</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> nor only to the Philoſophers among the <hi>Gentiles</hi>; Nor were there, at the firſt, <hi>many Rich, or Noble, called; But the Poor had the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel preached to them.</hi> The Apoſtles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared their Doctrine, freely to the multitude; Nay, ſo did our bleſſed Saviour himſelf; And, therefore, they muſt preach it in ſuch language as all might be capable of underſtanding, and receiving, it, if prejudice did not reſiſt the impreſſion. For their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign being to plant Chriſtianity in the World, to make Proſelytes to the Kingdom of Heaven, and, in the belief and practice of this Religion, to bring the lapſed race of men once more to God, by diſſwading them <hi>from the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of their wayes, and by guiding their feet into the way of peace</hi>; Why ſhould any think that they delivered the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of mens future, and everlaſting
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:100880:95"/>
concerns, and the preſent Laws to guide them by, in ſo myſterious a manner, or ſuch muffled language, that the end of all their diſcourſes might be loſt by their ſpeaking unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibly to the people? Now ſince the ſouls of men, that are not too much hindered by a very bad conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of their bodies, have all the ſame principles of Reaſon, and every Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual has a proper judgement pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly his own, and either we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the languages, and ſchemes of ſpeech, in which the Doctrines, and Rules of life delivered by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, were written: Or, elſe, we receive them faithfully tranſlated, (eſpecially in neceſſary Doctrines and rules, which the Criticks themſelves cannot well torture, becauſe they are oftener than once delivered) from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral pious and learned men, who more perfectly and compleatly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood them. Why ſhould things, therefore, that were, at firſt, plain to the capacity of the meaneſt, be ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure to us, that we muſt want a guide who is infallible to direct us, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, in all our wayes; and what is worſt of all, he ſplits us, at laſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:100880:95"/>
a ſtone? If God has not thought it fit to bridle mankind ſo, as to curb them from becoming ſinners, but has, in this, left them to their own choice, that if they will ſin, it may be their own act and deed; Why ſhould we think that he has chained them ſo faſt one to another, that they cannot err, or wander out of the way, unleſs they break that link which ties them all to an Infallible Chair? But, alas! ſuch is our condition here, that we may as well expect to free mankind from the commiſſion of ſin, as to reſtrain all men from error; Nay, there is as great a neceſſity that the lives of men ſhould be void of the one, as there is, that they ſhould be free from the other: As much reaſon there is <hi>for men to be holy in all manner of converſation,</hi> as there is for all to be ſound in the faith; ſince if we have faith, we may have it to our ſelves, but the actions of our lives have an influence upon others. Why, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſhould there not be an irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble power, ſet up to reſtrain men from vice, as well as a ſtanding infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility to keep them from error? Since God then, who will judge men hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for thoſe things which are properly
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:100880:96"/>
their own, has not thought it fitting to ſet up the one, I cannot but ſuſpect that he never deſigned to fix the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but to leave men to their own faculties, to which he has added ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient aſſiſtances, to judge and to chuſe fairly for themſelves; And therefore, methinks, 'tis more reaſonable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that, ſince men cannot pretend to both, it would be more modeſt to pretend to neither; eſpecially ſince we have no authority (whatever power any have gained or uſurped among us) from reaſon or revelation to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance any among the Race of men to be an infallible Judge in Religion, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than his ſentence proceeds accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Laws of the Goſpel; And by this I cannot find that he has done any more, beyond the faculties we have received as we are men, than to give us a Rule ſufficient to judge Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines by, and Laws by which we are to govern our practice, together with ſome ſuperadded means to help our judgments, and direct our Opinions by the Authority of Magiſtrates, who are an Ordinance of God, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of his Miniſters, who are alſo of Divine inſtitution, and the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:100880:96"/>
common aſſiſtances of his Holy Spirit, to guide us into all neceſſary truths, which tend to the promotion of our eternal happineſs; And ſo the final ſucceſs is left to our own liberty and choice, either in a refuſal or compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with them; Becauſe I cannot believe but that God acts ſuitable to the nature of human creatures in all his general diſpenſations to men, that ſo he may, in our future ſtate, with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual juſtice inflict puniſhment, or give us a reward according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. And, indeed, to (write ſtrictly) <hi>to be ſound in the Faith,</hi> would not be praiſe worthy, if it were ſo ordered, that we could not err; Nor need S. <hi>Paul</hi> have ſo carefully exhorted to this, if we might have been ſo eaſily preſerved from all diſeaſes, and devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations in Religion, by the infallibility of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and thoſe who plead their Title from him. I am ſure that an Apoſtle acquaints the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, that there muſt be alſo Hereſies among them, that they who are approved, may be made manifeſt,</hi> (1 Cor. 11.19.): By which he proves, and fore-tells, matter of fact, though he does not ſignifie Gods approbation; but only
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:100880:97"/>
his permiſſion of them; And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why he ſuffered error and diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be introduced among them by the perverſeneſs or curioſity of any, was, that ſuch as united in the true Faith might brighten, and ſhine forth with the greater glory, and like the Sun in the Firmament might tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over Clouds and darkneſs. There is no foundation therefore to erect the Popiſh infallibility on, nor for any Church to ſet up ſuch a Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal among themſelves.</p>
               <p>Having thus (as I hope) cleared my ſelf from any great and unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable miſcarriage in this point; I ſhall briefly proceed in reflecting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome miſtakes of others, that are falſe Rules to judge Doctrines and Spirits by: Wherein private Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts are moſt notoriouſly guilty. Theſe ſmell Popery at a diſtance, and can hardly promote any deſign with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pretending that it is ſuddenly to be introduced into the moſt Proteſtant and beſt eſtabliſhed Church in the World: But they too publickly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themſelves to be Popiſhly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, who are very apt to ſpie errors in the Pope, and yet ſo transfer them
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:100880:97"/>
to themſelves, and ſteal them away, that they may have the Monopoly of them, and retale them to others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der new names, when they are in the poſſeſſion of another Maſter. Theſe will not allow the Pope to be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but are apt to conclude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſo; And thus they fetch Candles from <hi>Romes</hi> Altars, that they may ſet them up in their own Breaſts: As if there were no difference betwixt <hi>the holy Spirits guiding men into truth,</hi> and walking by the light of their own fires: What either a diſeaſe and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their bodies, or their minds, has made a repreſentation of to their phancies, ſo long, till their brooding thoughts have, at laſt, produced ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which they may juſtly call their own; Theſe things they are apt to think, or at leaſt to ſay, are the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of the Spirit, and accordingly they will adventure to guide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and impoſe their own enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed phancies upon other men: But if every thing of this nature, and mens wild diſcourſes, the effect of this, were to receive the ſtamp of Divine Authority, and become infallible guides of action; So ſtrange a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:100880:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>
would be made among us, and ſuch a monſtrous <hi>Babel</hi> would be ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that Trowels would be call'd for inſtead of Morter, and men would cry out for Bricks, before they had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Straw to make them: Their tongues would be ſo various and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible, that a <hi>Teutonick</hi> language could never reconcile them, nor be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſcover them, nor give marks to know the firſt Builders by, when they are diſperſed into divers Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: But every mans head would ſtill tilt againſt another, and bring a kind of damnation upon the World: The Society of Devils would be more regular than men, who muſt live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God, or <hi>Beelzebub:</hi> The births of reaſon would be deem'd abortive, and the fruits of madneſs would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the characters of ſobriety and diſcretion: The greateſt Lunaticks would be moſt Religious, and we ſhould pay the greateſt veneration to a Fool.</p>
               <p>But ſince things are not come to this paſs yet; I ſhall briefly examine a very few falſe Rules, by which ſome among us ſatisfie themſelves in the tryal of Spirits, and guidance of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:100880:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> There are ſome that build much on what they ſtile the Return of prayer; when they have made a Faſt the Prologue to contention; and a long Prayer has been the Breakfaſt, when they reſolved to dine upon Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows houſes; yet they have too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently thought, or at leaſt endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to cauſe others to believe, that what has happened after their prayer, has been the return from Heaven to it, and a ſufficient guide to future action, and an aſſurance that it was both law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and juſt. Many men when they have for ſome time brooded upon a thing, they are apt then to petition Heaven, to inform them of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs or convenience, or the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs or inconvenience of it: And having ended their devotion, finding their thoughts to run ſtill in the ſame chanel, into which they had turned and confined them before, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this to be a ſufficient warrant for them to proſecute, and accompliſh their deſign; And the eagerneſs of their intention, which proceeds only from their predeterminated reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they fooliſhly take for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Spirit, which, they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:100880:99"/>
againſt all reaſon to think, thus guides them to conclude the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their deſire. And this is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable hint, becauſe, in this method, many wicked and unlawful actions claim Gods patronage to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and defend them: And what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, and moſt bloody deſigns have been attempted, and carried on, by the impreſſions upon mens minds, after they have pretended to ſeek the Lord, and thus gained what they have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Return to their prayers, I need not now particularly relate; Hiſtory has reported, and will yet more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them to the World: This one thing has raiſed Rebellion, Murdered Princes, in deſign and act, violated all Sacred Obligations, and layes Religion at the feet of every freſh and fanciful pretender. At this rate we ſhall cheat our neighbours by a ſecret im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, and murder Gods Anointed by a ſpecial command, and no man can be ſafe in his Life and Fortune, if a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Hector,</hi> or a dreaming <hi>Enthuſiaſt</hi> has a mind, and power, to take them away: Nor will he long be without a Warrant, when by winking hard, and directing his thoughts, he may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:100880:99"/>
his own mind as he pleaſes, and with a melancholy, or ſturdy confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, proclaim God to be the Author of it. But, alas! God is then only, in a true and proper ſenſe, ſaid to hear, or make returns to our prayers, when he beſtows on us, thoſe good and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things which we have, with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and devotion, begg'd; And if any man, pondering on a wicked deſign of his own contrivance, in this caſe prayes to God for his direction; and, after his prayer, finds the ſinful impreſſion ſtill remaining; This proceeds from his own vicious, and Diabolical inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but not from the impulſe of Gods Spirit; And it can, by no reaſonable perſon, be accounted Gods anſwer to his prayers; Unleſs he will ſuppoſe the great Maker of Heaven and Earth, to be willing to offer the greateſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to his own nature, and to nurſe and cheriſh, what he would hate in himſelf, in thoſe who are the <hi>workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of his</hi> own <hi>hands.</hi> No greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach can be given to the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty than this, by thoſe who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and adore, his Being: For they make him the Patron to mens ſins; as if his eſſential purity and goodneſs
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:100880:100"/>
could permit him to inſtigate any to the commiſſion of thoſe things, which his juſtice, notwithſtanding, muſt, and cannot chuſe but, puniſh: Such ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the Supreme God, would, oftentimes, make the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of peace,</hi> to be guilty of the worſt War, and the ſhedding the beſt blood in a Kingdom; The God of Order, would become the cauſe of the greateſt confuſions among man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and, in plain terms, give himſelf the Lye. It cannot be ſafe, therefore, to make what we are apt to call an anſwer to our prayers, a rule of actions, unleſs they agree with Gods written word, and then there will be no need of a new War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; For the word of God as it is the beſt, ſo it muſt be to us the only, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral direction in our taking the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of good and evil.</p>
               <p>If, at any time, the following ſtrong impreſſions made upon our minds may be ſafe to guide us, after we have ſought to God for particular directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it muſt, as I conceive, be only in things that were indifferent before, that he may influence our prudential choice in matters which he has left
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:100880:100"/>
to our own option: And, even in this caſe, we muſt have a care that we do not fully reſolve before-hand, leſt we are found to be diſſemblers with God, and have no real heſitation in our own judgments; But if, in ſuch things, we have occaſion to make any applications to him, we muſt be ſure to leave room for his direction, and that we know not which way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine our ſelves by any of the Laws of Good and Evil: The lawfulneſs of either part muſt be evident, and we muſt deſire an influence on the government of our choice only in the prudential determination, with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the good conſequence, or ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. I cannot apprehend that any evil can attend this, it being a ſolemn acknowledgement of a Supreme Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who has the Government of the whole World, of our own weakneſs, and inability to guide our ſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his aſſiſtance, and conſequently of our dependence on him, which are great reaſons for our adorations and prayers: But yet the good that may, in particular, attend the purſuance of this muſt be left to Gods ſecret conduct, and to the intrigues and influence of his
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:100880:101"/>
providence, which no man is able to diſcover; Unleſs he could pry into the conſults of Heaven, and diſcloſe the ſecrets of an infinitely wiſe, and powerful Being, when, beſides what he has already revealed, there is not a key-hole to peep through. For my own part, I love not to be wiſe above what is written, or to be bold in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing Rules in thoſe caſes in which God has been pleaſed to give us none; but ſhall confine my ſelf to the Law and to the Teſtimony, and look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Scripture as my certain Rule, thus guiding my ſelf in this World, that I may at laſt through Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and the Merits of my Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er arrive at my proportioned glory in the next.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another falſe Rule of trying Opinions, Doctrines, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions in Religion, ſet up by ſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is every mans private judgement and determination; When, in the mean time, it takes not its meaſures from Gods Word, nor the general notions of Good and Evil, but from a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, private Spirit got into a ſingle mans thoughts and apprehenſions. Now to this head may be reduced

what mad-men call lights, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; What thoſe Enthuſiaſts, that will be Saints in ſpight of all their prophane actions, and dub themſelves Holy in the midſt of their own irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, call Conſcience; And what others, of a more ſmooth and gentle diſpoſition, ſtile Reaſon, that they may advance the powers of mankind to the degrading, if not expelling, the benign operations of the Holy Spirit of God. In a word; This ſeems to be the foundation of judgement, and the Rule of diſcerning Spirits and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines amongſt <hi>Quakers, Anabaptiſts, Independents,</hi> and the reſt of our Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſts (ſpeaking in the general), of all that follow the <hi>Socinian</hi> Principles, and is the foundation of Popery it ſelf, when thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion miſtake the reſult of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours Opinions, enacted into Laws, for the true dictates of the Holy Ghoſt inſpiring the Pope, or preſiding at their Councils, and infallibly aſſiſting in their determinations. But none of theſe things taken as they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, can poſſibly be a ſafe Rule, much leſs, the higheſt conduct in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion: When we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:100880:102"/>
that though they may be helps to judge upon the view of the Rule; Yet phancy and opinion may fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be miſtaken for reaſon, illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, Conſcience, nay, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of the holy Spirit it ſelf; and, according to the common inferences about theſe matters, are ſo concluded, and believed by men that conſult their own faculties. But this will yet be more evident if we conſider, (1.) That the holy Spirit of God does not, in any ages, ſince he inſpired thoſe that delivered the Scriptures to be the rule of life, either illuminate, or direct mankind in the things relating to their eternal peace, in any other manner, than (1.) By thoſe Scriptures (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the faculties of human nature, and the general propoſitions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion among mankind) which he inſpired the Sacred Pen-men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. (2.) By inclining as well as authorizing ſome men, being prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by education and ſtudy, to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue a ſucceſſion of that Miniſtry, which our Saviour appointed, <hi>to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to the end of the World,</hi> to explain the difficulties in Religion unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: And (3.) Confirming by a
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:100880:102"/>
ſecret and inexplicable operation (which is eaſily believed by all that affirm Gods Grace, or Providence; and in conſequence his Being) the propoſitions contained in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures unto the minds of men, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining their faculties to believe and embrace them; Which influence is obtained by prayer, (to him that is of a docil diſpoſition) as well as gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in our Sacred Baptiſm, till ſuch time as we either reſiſt or renounce it, all which ſhall be more evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I make an end. Now none of theſe, (though great priviledges) can intitle any to that illumination, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate guidance, which wild men make the rule of their faith, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor of their actions; But they may miſtake (and be confident in it) their own phancy and high opinion, proceeding either from thoughtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or diſpoſition, for immediate motions from the Spirit of God. And (2). As for the conſciences of men, if they miſtake them not for phancy, opinion, or a ſtrong perſuaſion of their own minds: they are nothing but the agreement of our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with Gods word, (for thus
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:100880:103"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Some make ſuch Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as crowns their opinions with ſucceſs, to be an argument that their opinions are true: But to evince the invalidity of this needs no other than
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:100880:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this obſervation; That when the ſame things are covered with a Cloud, their Authors puniſhed, or the propagation of their tenets becomes improſperous, the ſame men will not admit of the ſame argument; Nor permit others to defend their opinions by the ſame <hi>medium,</hi> with which they prov'd their own. <hi>When the Sun for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhines upon them, and the Heavens ſmile; then, behold! the hand of the Lord is with them:</hi> But when a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous ray refreſhes others, and they receive not the countenance they had before, but have the frowns and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements of Superiors: Behold now! wickedneſs is ſeated in high places; The holy Seed are led into the Wilderneſs, and perſecution attends the Elect of God, and <hi>Canaanites</hi> poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the Holy Land. But, if ſucceſs were an argument for inſpiration, and ſmiling Providences a rule to judge Doctrines by; <hi>Numa Pompi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> might have had an argument for the inſpirations from his Nymph <hi>Aegeria,</hi> and for the truth of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion he eſtabliſh'd among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans:</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> might have been loſt in the Wilderneſs, and have ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified

the making their Gods to go before them: They had ceaſed to have the marks of a Church, and would not have been the people of the Lord, when they were carried into <hi>Egypt</hi> or <hi>Babylon:</hi> Nay, by this, they might have juſtified their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the great <hi>Meſſiah</hi>; and <hi>Pilate,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Guards, might have had an argument for executing him: The Primitive Chriſtians muſt be condemned, and the Apoſtles inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration be proved an impoſture, if a dark Providence be that, by which the Doctrines of men are to be judg'd: <hi>Mahomet</hi> muſt have been deemed a true Prophet, when he gathered ſo many Proſelytes in the <hi>Eaſt</hi>; And the great <hi>Turk</hi> be yet as holy, as he has been for the moſt part proſperous in the World: Nay Popery it ſelf, muſt then be embraced, if the glory and proſperity of opinions muſt prove them true, and ſucceſs becomes the meaſure of Religion: This is a way to juſtifie all lucky Uſurpations; To determine right and wrong by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; and the longeſt Sword may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meaſure out the largeſt Poſſeſſion, and the property of mankind, muſt

ſtrength was firm and ſound; They were not in trouble like other men</hi>; but pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued leſs than thoſe that were better: <hi>Therefore pride compaſs'd them as a chain, and violence covered them as a garment, their eyes ſtood out with fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and they had more than heart could wiſh,</hi> (Pſal. 73.). And <hi>Solomon</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that, as to the changes of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity and adverſity, <hi>all things come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to all, there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to him that ſacrificeth, and to him that ſacrificeth not; As is the good, ſo is the ſinner, and he that ſweareth, as he that feareth an oath,</hi> (Eccleſ. 9.2.): This indeed may prove that there ſhall be a future account; But neither can the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or wickneſs of a party be eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by ſuch external characters; much leſs the truth or falſhood of opinions, confirmed from the ſmiles or frowns of Providence. But I need not at preſent argue this point farther; ſince thoſe that when proſperous, invented it as a rule to walk by, and as an argument to confirm their party, and a bait to draw Proſelytes, and Abettors, to them, are now confuted by their ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful overthrow; And it would ſink
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:100880:105"/>
them more, ſhould it be uſed with any ſevere enlargement, ſince their honour layes in the duſt, and I hope it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver riſe again. I ſhall leave this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as a term of Religion, and a falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rule only taken up to ſerve a turn, and proceed to thoſe methods and ways, by which we may diſcern true Doctrines from falſe inſpirations.</p>

               <p>ANd (<hi>Firſt,</hi>) As to the Trial of the Doctrines and Opinions of thoſe that vent them with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and zeal, as if they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely inſpired; we muſt conſider, that thoſe to whom theſe Doctrines are propounded, are reaſonable creatures, And this will be yielded without any reaſoning about it, unleſs we have a mind to degrade our ſelves, as well in ſpeculation, as many do in practice, to the beaſts that periſh: nay, any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection formally framed againſt this ſuppoſal, would prove what the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector endeavours to deny, that men had diſcurſive faculties, and his own confutation would be included in his Objection, whilſt that would prove him able to ſyllogize, and reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Men being rational and intelligent beings, it follows, that they are able to diſcern the truth or falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of propoſitions, ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to their conſideration, in terms
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:100880:106"/>
that exceed not the expreſſions of the ſenſe of one man to another; and in matters that are not elevated above humane capacities; our diſcourſes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe to one another, would be no more, than the chirping of Birds, the ſpeech of Parrots, or the jabbering of Monkeys to each other; and would be nothing more than an uncertain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct ſound, without any ſignification.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We muſt conſider too, that it is not ſuitable to the Nature of God to impoſe upon the faculties of men, ſo as to delude and cheat them with any equivocal and falſe propoſitions; eſpecially when he deſigns them as a Rule to men to guide them in their concerns and actions in this World, or in the way to their everlaſting peace: Becauſe the notion men have of him, the truth of which he has evidenced to the World, renders him a Being of all poſſible perfection; otherwiſe we ſhould ſuppoſe God to be liable to the common frailties and infirmities of men. Now, if he be ſupreamly perfect, he muſt, according to our own reaſon, and thoſe faculties that are implanted in us, be one of infinite Truth and Goodneſs, If he be the firſt, he will not deliver
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:100880:107"/>
propoſitions unto men, that are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or more obſcurely, falſe; And, if he be a good Being, he will not give Rules that may deceive us, if we uſe thoſe faculties he has beſtowed on us, to find out their meaning and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; The contrary to this would cheat the World, and then he would make creatures (or at leaſt ſeem to do it) that he might, with great circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and ſolemnity, ſubtilly lead them into eternal ruine; Which to ſuppoſe, is as great blaſphemy againſt the Divine Nature, as can be invented by the worſt of creatures that have made themſelves malicious; And as foul an infamy as can be caſt upon Gods being, by the worſt of men; ſince <hi>he deſires not the death of ſinners themſelves; but rather that they ſhould return from their wickedneſs and live:</hi> This is confirmed by thoſe threats he denounces againſt them to frighten them from eternal ruine; by all thoſe promiſes he has annex'd to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; by all his exhortations to them to amend their lives; by all the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and helps to Religion which he has graciouſly afforded them, by all that ſorrow and trouble he expreſſes
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:100880:107"/>
whilſt men remain in that ſtate of ſin which entitles them to eternal miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; And by ſending his only Son into the World, to offer himſelf a Sacrifice for them, that Divine Wrath and Juſtice being appeaſed, they might be capable, according to the Rules and Directions he propoſed, and the Aids and Aſſiſtances he has given them, to recover themſelves out of thoſe ſnares in which they were entangled, and to guide themſelves into the way of peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> From hence it follows, that there are ſufficient Means and Wayes afforded us, by which we may, as reaſonable creatures, judge of true directions and falſe; ſo that we may not ſpend our time in uncertainties in matters of ſuch vaſt and infinite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment. Gods promiſe of Heaven and eternal bliſs, would be to as total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſignificant, if it were made ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon ſuch conditions as we knew not, or had not ſufficient abilities with his influence to perform them: And to what purpoſe would it be, to tell the World, that <hi>in keeping Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, there is great reward,</hi> if we knew not what the Commandments
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:100880:108"/>
were? We could not make ſenſe of that Thankſgiving of our Saviour, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 11.25.) <hi>I thank thee, O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Lord of heaven and earth, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent,</hi> (the <hi>Rabbies</hi> amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> among the <hi>Gentiles) and haſt revealed them unto babes</hi>; to perſons of a more inferiour rank and capacity; if thoſe whom he here calls Babes, had not means to know the certainty of the Revelation, and to arrive at compleat and diſtinct notions of the things that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed; And in vain would it have been for S. <hi>Paul</hi> to have ſpoken <hi>the hidden things of God in a myſterie</hi>; (the Doctrine of Chriſts coming into the World, hid under <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Types and Shadows, and obſcurely treated of by the Prophets, in compariſon to the Light which then appeared) or to have treated of ſuch Doctrines of the Goſpel, which diſcovered things, <hi>which neither eye had ſeen, nor ear heard, nor did</hi> they <hi>ever enter into the heart of man,</hi> when God revealed them by his Spirit (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.) and not by any Logical demonſtration; which blinded the Governours amongſt the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:100880:108"/>
                  <hi>Jews,</hi> and confounded the Philoſophers among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who, according to their accuſtomed way of proof, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted another method of probation, than the <hi>demonſtration of the Spirit, and of power</hi>: It had been, notwithſtanding, an impoſſible attempt for the Apoſtle to have endeavoured to reduce any of theſe, or other men, that knew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be endued with reaſon, to the belief of the Goſpel, which was proved Divine by the teſtimony and revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit, if ſufficient means were not afforded them to know, and diſtinguiſh Divine Revelation, from impoſture and pretences. The things delivered were above the reach of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reaſonings, and Philoſophy then gave check to their belief, and cuſtom and education had impreſs'd them with different, nay, contrary notions of things: It muſt be ſuppoſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, antecedently to their reception of the Goſpel, that as S. <hi>Paul</hi> was able to give them evidence, that thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines he delivered to them, were revealed from Heaven, ſo there were ſome Methods and Rules, by which they might be able to know the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and not receive it upon his bare
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:100880:109"/>
teſtimony: Nay, to what purpoſe would it be for S. <hi>John</hi> to direct men to <hi>try the Spirits,</hi> if we had not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent means to know, <hi>whether they were from God,</hi> or no?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> This muſt be granted too, that there are falſe Pretenſions and Doctrines of men vented in the World, under the notion of true; And true and falſe under the ſame pretence of inſpiration: The Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>many falſe Prophets are gone out into the world</hi>: And our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our (to prevent a raſh belief, and thereby an Apoſtaſie from the Goſpel, or truſting in another <hi>Meſſiah,</hi>) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints the World, that there would <hi>ariſe falſe Chriſts</hi> and <hi>falſe Prophets, (Mark</hi> 13.22.): And therefore they ſhould not believe and entertain them, although according to their different principles and deſigns, they ſhould cry out, <hi>Lo! here is Chriſt</hi>; or <hi>Lo! there</hi>: And S. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, that, as there were falſe Prophets formerly amongſt the people, ſo there ſhould be falſe Teachers among the Chriſtians, who ſhould <hi>privily bring in damnable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, denying the Lord that bought them</hi>; and, that <hi>many ſhould follow their perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:100880:109"/>
wayes:</hi> (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 2.). Nay, S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us of thoſe, who, in a <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary humility,</hi> and <hi>worſhipping of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> intruded into thoſe things which they <hi>never ſaw</hi>; being <hi>vainly puffed up in their fleſhly minds</hi>; who, yet, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the head, Chriſt himſelf who is the head of the Church; making the coming to God by the Mediatory application to an Angel, a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their humility, and ſo reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the interceſſion of our Saviour <hi>the only Mediator betwixt God and man, (Col.</hi> 2.18.). But our own Age is ſo fruitful in examples of this kind, that the poſſibility of mens falſe pretences to revelation, and of their venting cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Doctrines to the World, needs no other argument to prove it, than our own experience; Nor need we rake in the duſt of falſe Prophets, in paſt Ages, when we have, to our great grief and trouble, living monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, on which theſe things are to be read, and ſeen.</p>
               <p>Yet (<hi>Sixthly,</hi>) Notwithſtanding all this, we muſt maintain that there is ſuch a thing as true inſpiration; This is plainly implied by <hi>S. John,</hi> to whom I muſt adhere; For it would be ill
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:100880:110"/>
Logick to infer that, becauſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle adviſeth us not <hi>to believe every Spirit,</hi> therefore we ſhould give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit unto none; But rather that ſome are to be believed: Eſpecially when we take in his direction with it; <hi>Try the Spirits whether they are of God:</hi> This argues that ſome Doctrines came from Heaven, and ſome men were inſpired from above, although <hi>many falſe Prophets were gone abroad into the world.</hi> Should the contrary be held by any among us, it would not only invalidate the Doctrine of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; But of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles under the New; it would conclude the intercourſe betwixt God and men to be an impoſſible Chimera, and turn all Divinity into a Fable; And at once render our time miſ-ſpent and loſt, whilſt I am writing, and others read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Doctrines as theſe, and all diſputes concerning any poſitive and inſtituted Religion, the fooliſh talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and inventions of men, that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie themſelves to deceive others, and give trouble to their own fleſh; When mans reaſon might ſupply all: But ſuch a phancy I ſuppoſe to be too
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:100880:110"/>
wild and extravagant, to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ſuch an age of the world as this; Eſpecially among thoſe, who have frequented Chriſtian Aſſemblies, and have heard discourſes, proving the truth of the Old Teſtament, or the New; That have read the <hi>Jews</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for their Law, or the Chriſtian Fathers Apologizing for the Religion of the Goſpel: Nor indeed, can any deny the truth of Gods converſing with men, that reject not his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence; or elſe doubt of the nature and capacity of their own ſouls: To be ſure they muſt deny the Scriptures to be the Word of God, and affirm all his appearances to men to be a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Since from them we are aſſured, that <hi>all Scripture was given by inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from God,</hi> (2 Tim. 3.16.). And therefore to men, that acknowledge this, I muſt be ſuppoſed to direct this diſcourſe, as well as S. <hi>John</hi> does in the Text ſo frequently recited, who ſuppoſes that there is a Divine inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, before he adviſes men to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the pretences of falſe Prophets, from the Doctrines of thoſe that are true: 'Tis in vain otherwiſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men to exerciſe their faculties,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:100880:111"/>
aſſiſted by Rules; or to make any diſcrimination at all, where there is no foundation for the concluſion of a difference.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Therefore, The trial of the Doctrines and Rules of men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending inſpiration, having thus far been brought on towards a concluſion: The determination of our aſſent and choice in matters of ſuch huge and vaſt moment, on which the welfare of our ſouls depends, muſt be direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by what, ſufficiently, without fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, evidences thoſe Doctrines which we receive from others, or are led into the belief of from our own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, are certainly ſuch as came from God, and that we are not impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon by our own temperament, or the ſubtilty of others: The evidence therefore for a Divine revelation muſt be greater and ſtronger than any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument framed to the contrary; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in all the diſcoveries of truth, my belief is to be determined accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to evidence, and the greateſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability guides the rational choice of men; And all that act ſuitably to themſelves, embrace the propoſition that comes neareſt to truth and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty:
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:100880:111"/>
But where two things ſeem e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual in their proof, a rational man on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heſitates and doubts, and gives up his aſſent to neither: And therefore had the Magicians of <hi>Egypt</hi> equall'd the Miracles <hi>Moſes</hi> wrought in the preſence of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> as well as they did in turning rods into Serpents, and Rivers into blood, and cauſing Froggs to come up before him; They need not, at that time, have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd <hi>Moſes</hi>'s power diſproportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their own, nor diſtinguiſhed their own Miracles from his, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>This is the finger of God</hi>; And <hi>Pharaoh</hi> himſelf might have had an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual argument to detain the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> as they had for the command of God to depart out of the Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi> But when the Miracles on their ſide, far exceeded the Wonders on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, his own reſolution became his Law, and <hi>Pharaohs</hi> obſtinacy ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, till it was the ruine of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and followers, who all periſhed in the <hi>Red Sea. Ahab</hi> forſook the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, and worſhipped <hi>Baalim,</hi> and led the people into Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, joyning the Service of <hi>Baal with the God of Iſrael</hi>; And thus halted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:100880:112"/>
two opinions, till the trial be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt their Sacrifices was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned on <hi>Elijah</hi>'s ſide, who was the Prophet of the Lord; Whilſt fire came down from Heaven, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the Sacrifice upon Gods own Altar, which <hi>Baal</hi> could not effect on his: But then the people determined their choice, and gave their aſſent, <hi>that the Lord is God</hi>; and preſently ſlew the Prophets of <hi>Baal,</hi> for whom before they had great eſteem, (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18<hi>th Chap.</hi>). Hence was it alſo that our Saviour ſaid concerning the <hi>Jews,</hi> who, by Miracles evidencing <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Commiſſion, had juſtly received the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi>; That if he had not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſeded their Religious Cuſtoms, which till his coming were juſtly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed, by ſhewing his Authority, and Goſpel, to be Divine, by greater Miracles than thoſe that introduced and eſtabliſhed the Law, they had done well to adhere to it, and to look upon the Goſpel as an impoſture: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, a new Doctrine pretending to be Divine, and evacuating that which, having proof from Heaven, was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed before, muſt be confirmed with greater Miracles, than that
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:100880:112"/>
which it pretends to aboliſh: <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſayes our Saviour) <hi>If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had ſin,</hi> (John 15.24.). Which way of trial will (by the way) hold good to the end of the World: From all which, it is plainly manifeſt, that all the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Doctrines of men, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to inſpiration, if they are ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to be received by us, muſt come with ſuch Evidence and Authority, as may ſurmount all difficulties and Objections to the contrary. So that if any men ſhould now pretend Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to give teſtimony to any Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions that contradict the Doctrines of the New Teſtament, they are not ſufficient to command our aſſent, and to determine our belief; Unleſs they are greater than any which Chriſt and his Apoſtles did, to confirm their Doctrine, which theſe new Opinions do oppoſe and contradict.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> In this trial of men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending inſpiration for the Doctrines they deliver, we muſt be ſure that the evidence they give for ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, be peculiarly Divine, and ſuch as cannot be given to men by any
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:100880:113"/>
thing inferiour to the power of God. It is not the grave deportment of the inſpired; nor the colour or ſhape of their faces; Nor the ſeeming inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of their own lives, extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry auſterities, or a leſs decent, and moroſe, living, that retires them from the converſation of the World; It is not a peculiar habit; nor any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth or ſluttiſh garments; 'tis nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feeding upon <hi>Locuſts</hi> and <hi>wild Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>; nor yet <hi>eating with Publicans and Sinners,</hi> that proves a Prophet to be Divine: Nor is it a full and copious expreſſion, attended with abundance of zeal and paſſion; nor, yet, a ſlow and pumping delivery, as if their notions were too bigg for their words, and their words too large for their mouths, that will evidence them to come from God: 'Tis neither their natural parts, or acquired ornaments; the antiquity of error, nor the glory, or number of thoſe that are proſelyted to it; 'tis neither the rendring error plauſible by diſtinction, nor glozing it over with miſrepreſented teſtimonies of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or pretending ſome latent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from the moſt obſcure places pf the Scripture, or rendring thoſe
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:100880:113"/>
obſcure, to countenance their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that are plain and open to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that muſt lead us from Divine truth, into Diabolical error, and make the God of truth to patronize a lye. In a word; 'Tis not an Argument from the ſucceſs an Opinion has in the world, (though Providence, thereby, ſeems, with ſome, to be entitled to it) nor any countenance from the Authority of men, nor the iterated affirmations of him that pretends to be thus inſpired, that are ſufficient to prove his Doctrines true: Becauſe all theſe things have frequently been publick atteſtations to thoſe that are falſe: But there muſt be ſuch evidence to thoſe Propoſitions which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to come immediately from God, as that by which he has always confirmed his Laws to the world; Something beyond the power of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that cannot be parallel'd by men or Devils; The Broad Seal of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven muſt be annex'd, that neither nature nor art is able to counterfeit.</p>
               <p>And this (<hi>Ninthly,</hi>) muſt be real Miracles, (in which the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy is included.) There have been many wonders effected in the world,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:100880:114"/>
and more ſtories of theſe than are true, which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> glory as much in, as if they were Miracles, if their art can hide their craft &amp; ſubtilty from thoſe that are more curious and inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive: The Pagan Prieſts led the van, aſſiſted by the power of ſubtil <hi>Daemons,</hi> to gain the peoples worſhip to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or to thoſe Images which they animated, and moved: And how far the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have followed them in this cheat and impoſture, has been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times too apparently diſcovered; And would be more, would they but be as ingenuous in their confeſſions, as they are witty in their ſubtil, though impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, inventions. The philoſophical knowledge of natural cauſes, together with an induſtrious application, will make ſome extraordinary and unuſual effects look like Miracles: For the moſt of men, being, by reaſon of an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our education, ignorant of many ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Art and Nature, which men of more refined underſtandings eaſily diſcover the cauſes of, are apt to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute thoſe things to the immediate operation of the firſt cauſe, which are reſults from thoſe that are ſecond; Art will do much, and Nature more: And
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:100880:114"/>
the Devil, many times, makes more ſtrange and unuſual appearances, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſiſted with the knowledge of both: And how many times do men admire the ſlight of a Jugler, till, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, they make diſcovery of his Craft; and attribute that to the power of the Devil, which he ingeniouſly does by ſlight of hand? Nay, the ſport that Devils make in the Air, we often take as the voice of Gods Thunder, and tremble, and are afraid at the Storm: But, yet, there is as much difference betwixt true Miracles, and very real Wonders, as there is betwixt Heaven and Hell; or the power of Nature, and that which firſt made and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues it, who can either ſuſpend its power, or alter its effects. Or as there is betwixt Nature and Art, which though the latter imitates, it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver equal; no more than the former vye with the God of Nature: Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles (eſpecially ſuch as are above the power of any thing inferiour unto God) have alwayes been receiv'd by men, as ſufficient atteſtations of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truths: Theſe were thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Teſtimonies, by which the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> evidenced his Commiſſion to the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:100880:115"/>
World, and added Gods authority to the reaſonableneſs of his Doctrine. When S. <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> ſent his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to him, to know whether he were the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> of which he knew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be Fore-runner; our Saviour returned no anſwer but this, <hi>Go your way</hi> (ſayes he), <hi>and tell</hi> John <hi>what things ye have ſeen and heard; how that the blind ſee, the lame walk, the lepers are cleanſed, the deaf hear, the dead are raiſed, to the poor the Goſpel is preached: (Luke</hi> 7.22.): By this intimating, that ſuch Miracles were ſufficient to convince him that he was the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> to whom ſuch power was given from above: Thus he endeavours alſo to convince the <hi>Jews</hi> by the argument of his Miracles; <hi>The ſame works that I do, bear witneſs of me, that the Father hath ſent me— (John</hi> 5.36.). Now, as by this argument our Saviour proved his own Commiſſion; ſo when he ſent forth his Apoſtles and the firſt Planters of his Religion into the World, he gave to them the ſame power to work Miracles for confirmation of their Doctrine. <hi>Heal the ſick</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>cleanſe the lepers, raiſe the dead, caſt out Devils, (Matth.</hi> 10.8.): And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:100880:115"/>
they proved their Doctrine to be Divine, and confirmed their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions to the World; preaching (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> did, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4.) not ſo much by Logical argument, or in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Philoſophers way of reaſoning; <hi>But in demonſtration of the Spirit, and of power:</hi> When they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued from the Old Teſtament to the New, and did Miracles to confirm all. This has been Gods method, in the World, of evidencing his Miſſion of Prophets unto men, to declare his Meſſages to them, by which he atteſted his own inſpirations; which, the moſt confident affirmations of the perſons inſpired, without ſuch plain and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick atteſtations, could never have cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated a belief of; Eſpecially if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered Articles of Faith, and things not demonſtrable to the reaſon of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Thus when God gave <hi>Moſes</hi> authority to lead, and preſide over the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> he endued him with a power to work Miracles to atteſt his Commiſſion (<hi>Exod.</hi> 4.): And when the Prophets were to make any new Revelation to Princes or people; or when God ſent them on any ſtrange errand, he added confirmation to their
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:100880:116"/>
authority, by giving them power to fore-tell ſomething which he brought to paſs; or elſe to work ſome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Sign, or Miracle; that thoſe to whom the Meſſage was ſent, might be convinced, that God ſent the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</p>
               <p>But yet, becauſe it is often ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for men to diſtinguiſh betwixt a Miracle and a Wonder, who know not the utmoſt power of Art or Nature; Eſpecially, they are ignorant of the skill and force of Devils; God has ſtill (in the laſt place) given Rules for our farther direction in this weighty affair; That the fancies of men may not by any ſubtilty whatſoever be impos'd upon with the ſeeming autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Divine Inſpiration: God knew that the Devil would endeavour in this to imitate the Divine Power, as well as <hi>appear like an Angel of light,</hi> when either might impoſe deluſions upon the World; That the art and induſtry of deſigning men, might, by a previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous acquaintance with Natural Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſo alter their ſimplicity by mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and experiment; or meet with ſuch a ſtrange diſpoſition of nature, lucky to them, as by the application of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:100880:116"/>
theſe, to the preſent conjunction of their own intentions, they might take advantage to inſinuate their ſubtile and falſe Doctrines into the minds of the vulgar, or credulous, and many times into thoſe that were more rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal and learned; Or elſe by a fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate prediction of ſomething that might come to paſs, aſſume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the honour and authority of Prophets, and then impoſe upon, and delude, the World. For the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, therefore, of ſuch great, and otherwiſe, unavoidable miſchiefs; the moſt gracious God, out of his infinite love to mankind, has given them three other Rules, by which they might, and may, meaſure Prophets and their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines. (1.) If any pretended their authority by fore-telling things to come; If they fail'd in any of their Predictions, 'twas a ſign that God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſent them to deliver that, which the Prediction was an argument to confirm: And that, not only becauſe the great God never confirms his Truths to the World by falſhood or deceit: But, becauſe he has cautioned us not to believe them: In the 18<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Deut. v.</hi> 22. <hi>When a Prophet ſpeaketh
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:100880:117"/>
in the Name of the Lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to paſs, this is the thing which the Lord hath not ſpoken; but the Prophet hath ſpoken it preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly; Thou ſhalt not be afraid of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Suppoſing that one who took upon him the name of a Prophet, and ſhould work Wonders (as <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and others under the New Teſtament) for confirmation of his Doctrine and Authority; Yet, if his Doctrines tend to the evacuating principles implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the minds of men, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reaſonable propoſitions of the Natural Religion of mankind; it was an apparent ſign of a falſe Prophet. <hi>For,</hi> ſayes the Text, <hi>If there ariſe among you a Prophet, or a Dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a ſign or a wonder, and the ſign or the wonder come to paſs, whereof he ſpake unto thee, ſaying, Let us go after other Gods, which thou haſt not known, and let us ſerve them; Thou ſhalt not hearken to the words of that Prophet, or that Dreamer of dreams, Deut.</hi> 13. at the beginning.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) In relation to both Natural, and Inſtituted, Worſhip; God having now given us a Rule, no pretenſion of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, or Miracle muſt ever draw us
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:100880:117"/>
into the opinions of men that thwart or contradict the Divine Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments already confirmed by the ſame argument; And this is evident, partly from that fore-quoted Text (<hi>Deut.</hi> 13.), where the reaſons, why that falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſhould not be received, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to draw men from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Principles of Natural Religion are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (1.) Becauſe God, by permitting that falſe Prophet, proved mens ſtedfaſtneſs in Religion. (2.) Becauſe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Signs and Wonders were done to confirm a Doctrine, men were ſo far to adhere to the true God, as to <hi>walk after him,</hi> and <hi>to fear him, to keep his commandments, to obey his voice, to ſerve, and to cleave unto, him.</hi> But this is yet more fully proved from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.20. When any ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to draw the people unto Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, and to ſuch as had familiar Spirits; The Prophet adviſes them to <hi>try</hi> all by the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Teſtimony</hi>; becauſe, <hi>if any ſpeak not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them.</hi> And if theſe directions were good under the Law, much more will they ſatisfie any reaſonable men under the Goſpel; this being the laſt publick
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:100880:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>
declaration of Gods Will, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to make to mankind, till the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal period and general diſſolution: <hi>For though we,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>or an Angel from heaven preach any other Goſpel, let him be accurſed (Gal.</hi> 1.8.). And he tells the World, that, at the final period, <hi>God ſhall judge the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of men according to the Goſpel, (Rom.</hi> 2.16.). Therefore the Goſpel is to be the ſtanding Law to the end of the World: Nor needs there any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it being the end of the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Conſtitutions, and ſuch a compleat Syſtem of Divinity, as is ſufficient to <hi>make a man perfect, throughly furniſhed to every good work,</hi> and thereby to prepare him for that <hi>eternal inheritance, that fadeth not away.</hi> And thus I have now conſidered all the chief parts of what I deſign, and with all faithfulneſs, according to my knowledge, diſcharg'd my ſelf: The diſcourſe on ſuch a point has been long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I hope it will not prove unuſeful, in ſuch times as theſe, in which truth is blended and beſet with error. Strange Doctrines have inſinuated into the minds of men; And we are now ſailing betwixt <hi>Sylla</hi> and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:100880:118"/>
                  <hi>Charybdis,</hi> and God knows, which may ſwallow us: When truth, like pure and clean Wheat, is put betwixt two Mill-ſtones, that ſeem to joyn to grind it in pieces: And Religion, like our Saviour upon the Croſs, is almoſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified betwixt two Thieves: But bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God, his Providence is over all his works, and through his help, we hope for deliverance, from all our troubles; For vain is the help of man without him.</p>

               <p>HAving hitherto, for the moſt part, treated concerning Falſe Spirits, and argued againſt the pretences to inſpiration among <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>; and given ſome directions, by which we may be able to diſcern what inſpiration is true, and what falſe: That it may not be objected againſt the body of this Diſcourſe, that I have left neither Soul, nor Spirit, to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate it; but have hinted only ſome operation of the Divine Spirit, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained that to the firſt Age of the Chriſtian Religion, as if it were not needful for future Generations, to guide men into all truth: I ſhall ſpend ſome Sheets to prove, That as there were Promiſes that the Holy Spirit of God ſhould conduct men after our Saviours Aſcenſion; ſo that theſe Promiſes were made good, by the apparent Deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt; And to ſhew, in what manner the Sacred Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:100880:119"/>
informed the Apoſtles, and the firſt Publiſhers of the Chriſtian Doctrines; And how he ſtill influences the minds of men in the underſtanding, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, them.</p>
               <p>The Wilderneſs of this World is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thick of Briars and Thorns, that ſcratch and tear the Church of Chriſt in her paſſage through it; And ſince the moſt who profeſs themſelves to be Chriſtians agree in the deſign, and end, of their journey; Yet becauſe we are apt to fall out by the way, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer about the determination of the paths that lead thither; Hence is it, that I have hitherto endeavoured to hinder men of good intentions, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent judgements, from entertaining a deluſion, by reaſon of any ſhortneſs in their ſight; that they may not be deceived by their own fancies, or the ſuggeſtions of others, and ſo miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in their greateſt concernments, and fall ſhort of eternal happineſs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: And leſt we ſhould complain, as if we were, in this errable ſtate of life, left without ſufficient means to conduct us to the great end of all our Religion; And, in the glorifying of God, to ſave our ſouls; I ſhall now
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:100880:120"/>
ſhew ſome things before hinted, more plainly, and openly; That we are not left without ſufficient conduct from the Holy, and true, Spirit of God; But that he was in the World, at the firſt delivery of the Doctrines and Rules of life, expreſſed in the Writings of the New Teſtament, and ſtill continues to influence the minds and actions of men.</p>
               <p>In order to the diſcharging this that I am now to engage in, I ſhall firſt prove, That the Holy Ghoſt did come according to the Predictions of the Prophets, and the Promiſe of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: For (1.) He came upon our Saviour himſelf. (2.) He inſpired and comforted his Apoſtles, and the firſt Planters of the Chriſtian Religion: And (3.) He ſtill influences the hearts and minds of thoſe that ſeek, and do not reſiſt, him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That this Holy Spirit reſted upon our Saviour, accompanying him throughout the actions of his life, none that pretends to the embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſtianity can poſſibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict: For his Miracles atteſt this Divine reſidency, and loudly proclaim it to Ages and Generations: And, if
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:100880:120"/>
there had not been this irrefragable teſtimony; yet, that there was ſuch a Divine impreſſion upon his mind; the purity of his Doctrine, and the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his life ſufficiently atteſted, and that the Divine Spirit inſpired and did aſſiſt him: As his Conception was by the power of the Holy Ghoſt, ſo did it continually breath upon him through all the periods of his whole life: It gave a viſible atteſtation to his Perſon and Doctrine, and witneſſed his Commiſſion to the World, when at his Baptiſm it deſcended in the ſhape of a Dove, and lighted upon him, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 3.16.): And this was ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by an audible voice, loudly thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering from the very Skies, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> In his life he had the <hi>Spirit without meaſure, (John</hi> 3.34.); He was not limited to the ſame proportions of power and aſſiſtance with S. <hi>John,</hi> who preached the Doctrine of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and by this prepared the way for the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>; Nor with thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of old, who were inſpired at ſundry times, and in diverſe manners; to whom divine and unaccountable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes were neither conſtant in their
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:100880:121"/>
method, or continuance; But the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit accompanied our Saviour throughout the ſeveral ſtages of his life; ſo that he could upon any emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent occaſion, make diſcovery of it to others, and alwayes knew it to be reſident in himſelf; he carried it with him to his Croſs and Death to ſupport him in his miſery, and to cauſe him to triumph over his temptations, and enemies; It hovered, as it were, over his Grave, guarding his body with a ſecurity beyond the Souldiers power; and at laſt raiſed him with triumph from the dead, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11.): and thus baffled the arguments for infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Spirit promiſed came alſo upon the Apoſtles of our Saviour. In the ſecond of the <hi>Acts</hi> at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; It deſcended with noiſe, and a glorious ſplendor, and came with ſuch a train of ſolemnity, and its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was ſo gay and pompous, that it amuſed Nations, and confounded the multitude; It ſhook the great place of their aſſembly, and ſate gloriouſly, in the ſhape of a Cloven Fiery Tongue, upon the head of each Apoſtle, giving them at once a character to diſtinguiſh
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:100880:121"/>
them from others, and ability to execute that Commiſſion which our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had before given them; <hi>They were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and began to ſpeak with other Tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance.</hi> Here was the Prophecy of <hi>Joel</hi> accompliſhed, that God would <hi>pour out his Spirit upon all fleſh</hi>: when the Holy Ghoſt thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended with power, in the lap of a Cloud, with a ruſhing wind, to blow open the doors of mens hearts, that the King of Glory might come in; It came with Cloven Fiery Tongues, to teach the Apoſtles to ſound forth the Goſpel to all the World with a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming zeal, and warm affection: The Tongues were Cloven, that they might be ſure to divide the Word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; and Glorious, like the ſtreams of Fire; not only to repreſent the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and Divinity of the Holy Ghoſt, or to ſignifie the clearneſs and perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity of the Goſpel; but to enflame the zeal, and warm the devotion of theſe Apoſtles: Nay, they were both Fiery and Cloven, that their zeal might not be divorced from knowledge; but one might adminiſter to the other, and both to him who influenced them

with this Spirit. This made them at once the admiration and envy of the World; This made their Doctrine glorious and triumphant, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it with Miracles, beyond the force of malice and contradiction: This cauſed the Church to ſpring from the Blood of Martyrs, made it live in the midſt of ſpight, and flouriſh on the tops of Croſſes and Gibbets; to ſhine gloriouſly in the midſt of flames, and triumph over death it ſelf, though its members were killed all the day long. This gave the Apoſtles the previſion of thoſe things, which, in our Saviours life, they were not able to bear, at the ſame time giving them a proſpect of their miſery, and their comforts too: This brought to their remembrance what their Maſter had before taught them, and inſpired them to the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of others, that they might build the Chriſtian Church upon that Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-Stone, which, though rejected of men, was in it ſelf elect, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Holy Spirit came alſo, upon the hearts of believers. The <hi>Samaritans that believed received the Holy Ghoſt, (Acts</hi> 8.17.); and <hi>whilſt
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:100880:122"/>
S. Peter was preaching</hi> (occaſion'd by the converſion of <hi>Cornelius), the Holy Ghoſt fell on thoſe that heard him, (Acts</hi> 10.44.): And though, as to thoſe glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous effects of that power which at firſt was frequent in working Miracles, and inſpiring men to ſpeak divers langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for the proof and early propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel, it now withdraws its force and operation; yet it ſtill continues that neceſſary influence, which impreſſes the minds of devout men, and aſſiſts them in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of their duty, and arms them with patience and reſolution: This Doctrine of the Spirits working upon the minds of men, is too frequently contradicted, even by ſuch as ſeem to want the aſſiſtance of ſome ſtrength ſuperiour to their own, whilſt to avoid one Rock, they run upon another: To eſcape that Enthuſiaſm which has too much diſturb'd the World, and led men into darkneſs and error, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the conduct of Gods Holy Spirit, when he would lead them into the way of truth. Men are ſo cautious leſt they ſhould infringe the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable liberty of their own wills, that they intrench upon the Divine
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:100880:123"/>
Providence, and endeavour to bind their God in chains, that he may ſit faſt in Heaven to very little purpoſe. If there were no ſuch thing as a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine influence and benediction from above, to what purpoſe would our prayers be? Why ſhould we petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for thoſe things which we are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured we ſhall never receive? Or how can any pray in faith, for what they believe will never come? We mock our Maker to his very face, when we ſay, <hi>Turn thou us O good Lord, and ſo ſhall we be turned</hi>; if God has no hand in the converſion of a ſinner: and it would be prophane and ridiculous to pray for the being or increaſe of grace, if God did not influence our minds; Nay, he that rejects this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, boldly pleads the cauſe of <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> againſt Chriſt, and the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of an Heathen countermands the Divinity of a Chriſtian; For how can God rule the world, &amp; exerciſe his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire over the Powers of the Earth; how can he controll the purpoſes of men, and rebuke their actions, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the counſels of his Will, and the deſigns of his Providence, if he does not immediately influence their wills, as
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:100880:123"/>
well as propoſe objects to their ſenſes? I know, we are too apt to disbelieve thoſe things which we do not fully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand; and to expunge that out of our Creed, which is not plainly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to our reaſon; But can it appear to be juſt and equal to reject a Being, becauſe we underſtand not the manner of its exiſtence? Or to deny ſuch ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects as we ſee, becauſe we have not a view of the Cauſe, which is inviſible? If ſo, then farewel the ſublimeſt Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Chriſtian Faith; And not only ſo, but the firſt Principle of all Religion, the Being of a God, which no mortal eye ever ſaw; nor can a finite Being frame a compleat Idea of him. Shall I deny the Creation of the World, becauſe I know not the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of its Makers operation, when he ſent forth his <hi>Fiat</hi>; Nor how ſo rare a Syſteme of things, could be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced out of nothing pre-exiſtent? Muſt I reject Spirits becauſe I cannot ſee them, or all the operations of imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Beings upon the corporeal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this World, becauſe moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongſt bodies, is made by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact, and I cannot apprehend how a Spirit can work upon a body, when
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:100880:124"/>
none but bodies can touch one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Who can tell how our ſouls work upon our bodies? And yet none is ſo ſenceleſs as to deny it: Nay who can deſcribe the manner of our ſouls union to our bodies? And yet no man will refuſe to own the thing; or will any one deny the parts of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, to be united to each other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the term of their union was never yet ſo fully reſolved, as to baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle all objections to the contrary? Why ſhould we then doubt of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits influencing the minds of men, becauſe the manner of operation is intricate and inexplicable? When we find it by the independence of our thoughts, and thoſe good ſuggeſtions crowded into the midſt of ſome evil contrivances, where no other reaſon can be given of them, but that they are injected from above, that we may fully convince our ſelves, by our own experience, that God works by his Spirit, and concurs with the motions of rational beings, when they incline to comply with his operations. <hi>The wind bloweth where it liſteth</hi> (ſayes our Saviour), <hi>and thou heareſt the ſound thereof, but canſt not tell whence it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:100880:124"/>
and whither it goeth; ſo is every one that is born of the Spirit,</hi> (John 3.8.). We all believe that the wind blows, when it becomes obvious to our ſenſes; And yet the cauſes of theſe different winds, and the reaſon of this ſwift motion of the Air, have puzled the wiſeſt and moſt inquiſitive Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers; God is, therefore, ſaid, by the Prophet, <hi>to bring the winds out of his treaſures,</hi> (Jer. 51.16.); And, in the Book of <hi>Job,</hi> we find that they <hi>break out of the chamber, and ſecret pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</hi> So we diſcern the fruits and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Spirit, though we cannot account for the manner of producing them: And, therefore, 'tis not unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to believe the influence of Gods Spirit upon the minds of men: For (1.) 'Tis poſſible. (2.) Neceſſary. (3.) From the Scripture infallibility, certain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The operation of the Holy Ghoſt upon the ſouls of men is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Our Saviour, to rebuke the wonder of his Diſciples at a Doctrine of his that ſeemed harſh and difficult, tells them, that <hi>with God all things are poſſible, (Matth.</hi> 19.26.). The poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity therefore of a thing, prepares us
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:100880:125"/>
for the belief of any propoſition, when either certainty or greater probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties do not plainly determine the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: Now, what does not imply a contradiction that it ſhould be, is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be: But the Holy Spirits ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration upon the minds of men does not imply any contradiction: And, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it muſt be, at leaſt, a poſſible ſuppoſition that it may be ſo. Nay further, what has been, is, certainly, poſſible to be: But that there has been ſuch influences upon the minds of men, the ſacred Inſpirations of the Prophets, and Apoſtles, do abundantly evince; And to aſſert the contrary, muſt ſhake the very foundation of Religion, and invalidate the whole Canon of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. And certainly, if it admits no contradiction, to affirm Spirits working upon Bodies; it muſt be leſs to ſuppoſe one Spirit to operate upon another; there being a nearer affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity betwixt their natures, and a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter capacity to apprehend the notices they receive from one another: For, if the Soul of one man may apprehend what are the thoughts of another, when they are expreſſed by the words of the tongue, or ſome external ſigns,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:100880:125"/>
and repreſentations; There is as great a probability, that there may be more eaſie and quicker methods for one ſoul to converſe with another, were they freed from their bodies, than by the mediation of external ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which may, and often do, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey falſe repreſentations to the mind. And, therefore, for the holy Spirit of God to influence the minds and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, is not only rendered poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; But a very probable, and eaſie, ſuppoſition: Though, whilſt we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in theſe bodies, 'tis all one, as to the being of the thing, whether we conjecture, (for it can be no more) the influence to be made immediately upon the ſoul, or by percuſſions on, or diſpoſitions of, the nerves, and by determining the Spirits, ſo as to make repreſentations to the mind, to cauſe in it deſire, or averſation, and from hence juſt and proportionable actions, ſuitable to the deſign of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p>But (<hi>Secondly,</hi>) this influence and operation of the holy Spirit, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſible, but neceſſary too; if we conſider our own weakneſs and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; or the circumſtances we are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:100880:126"/>
ſurrounded with in this vale of tears, and region of miſery; We have ſtill a proneneſs and propenſity to ſin, notwithſtanding our being waſhed by an holy Baptiſm, and dipt in the ſacred Laver of regeneration: And, though grace were then convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us, and power to perform our part of the Covenant which at laſt gives us the poſſeſſion of the promiſe; Yet this cannot well be apprehended to be tied about us with ſuch indiſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bonds, as not to forſake us upon the violation of our vow, when by ſinful courſes we reſcind Gods obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to us: Or, if there were no forfeiture to be made; Yet we cannot apprehend this Grace and Spirit, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us at the firſt, to be ſo conſtantly and powerfully reſiding in us, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to need any new ſupplies, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions of degrees; Or to be like our ſouls, alwaies tied continually to invigorate us without any new influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences from above: God governs the World by his Providence, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports this great ſyſteme of Beings by the conſtant and continued influences of his Power impreſſing things, by his Divine concurrence, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:100880:126"/>
the end and deſign of their beings, to continue their ſtated motions and order, and to repair their decayes, by a new and uninterrupted ſucceſſion; Now it would not be more falſe and unſuitable to his nature, to ſuppoſe him at firſt to have put things into their orderly motions, and to impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate nature with all the power, at once, that ſhall at any time be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for its ſupport and conduct, when things are ſubject to ſuch various miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventures, that it is impoſſible for any but himſelf to foreſee; Than it would be to ſuppoſe him to give a child, in his ſacred Baptiſm, ſufficient ſtrength to influence his whole life, and afterwards leave him to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts and misfortunes without any new aſſiſtances from above: This would, ſtill, make the Great and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Being of the World, inſtead of a wiſe and active God, nothing but an idle and lazy Spectator: We need not, then, pray for grace, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued acceſſions of ſtrength and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; But only uſe thoſe words of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid; Caſt us not away from thy preſence, and take not thy holy Spirit from us,</hi> (Pſal. 51.11.). The Apoſtles and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:100880:127"/>
Primitive Diſciples, of our Saviour were ſenſible of new acceſſions, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes from the Spirit, as the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties increaſed which they encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered: <hi>For as the ſufferings of Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in us</hi> (ſayes S. <hi>Paul), ſo our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation alſo aboundeth by Chriſt,</hi> (2 Cor. 1.5.). And when we ſhall conſider that our aſſiſtances are neceſſary in proportion to our duties, or our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, (all men being not in the ſame circumſtances, but ſome have an eaſier paſſage to an eternal reſt, and a bleſſed eternity, than others who are made a ſpectacle to the world; who have greater difficulties to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, a longer race to run upon the Earth, and are ſurrounded with a larger number of duties, and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) certainly God, who is the God of all grace, will reaſonably give the influences of his Spirit ſuitable to the degrees of mens neceſſities, and the employments, or conflicts that his moſt wiſe Providence calls them unto: As the Apoſtles were not ſufficient of themſelves to preach the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine to the World, and to obviate thoſe difficulties that attended the publication; ſo neither can any of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:100880:127"/>
us, in our ordinary courſe of affairs in the World, being placed in the midſt of ſnares and temptations, keep conſciences void of offence, without the influences of Gods grace, and the aſſiſtances of his Spirit: S. <hi>Paul</hi> juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies himſelf to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them a proſpect of his joy, and innocence: <hi>Our rejoycing is this</hi> (ſayes he), <hi>the teſtimony of a good conſcience; that in ſimplicity, and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our converſation in the world, and more abundantly to you wards,</hi> (2 Cor. 1.12.). And when, in the third Chapter, he re-aſſumes the argument; leſt they ſhould think that all was effected by his own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; he introduces alſo this acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement: <hi>Not that we are ſufficient of our ſelves, to think any thing as of our ſelves; but our ſufficiency is of God,</hi> ver. the 5<hi>th.</hi> God is not an hard and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere Maſter, <hi>to reap where he did not ſow, nor to gather where he did not ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>; He expects an account of his own talents, which every one does, or may, receive, in proportion to his wants and neceſſities, that he may grow up unto that meaſure of ſtature to which
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:100880:128"/>
Chriſt has appointed him in the world; And doubleſs we may obtain Divine helps; If men have but that love to themſelves, as to pray with fervency and devotion for them: <hi>For, if ye, being evil,</hi> (ſayes our Saviour), <hi>know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more ſhall your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father give the holy Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> (Luke 11.13.). And ſince God is ſo bountiful to us, let us not be wanting to our ſelves: For, when we ſhall, with retirement, conſider, how numerous and potent our ſins are, which muſt all, in their habits be mortified, and ſubdued; how many turbulent or inticing tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations we have to oppoſe, that are ready every day to conquer us, and ſteal, inviſibly, to our moſt ſecret en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments; how many paſſions we have to calm, and moderate, which, upon every ſuitable, and tempting, occaſion endeavour to make an inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection againſt our reaſon; How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſonal, and relative, duties we are to perform in a wiſe and pious or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering our converſation; how the ſuggeſtions of our own fleſh, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections of Sathan, and the malice and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:100880:128"/>
defilements of the world will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to oppoſe, and obſtruct, our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs: When we conſider the black paſſage of death, and the grave, (and God knows what diſmal encounters we may meet with in our way to them); What fears will then ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ariſe to baffle our hopes, and make our faith ready to expire; And upon the whole, when we reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our weakneſs, and miſerable infirmity; In a word; When we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how much work we have to do, how little time to perform it, and what great diſproportion there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt our duty and our power; It will not only appear, that it is high time to awake out of ſleep; to riſe and be doing: But to take the Armour of God for our defence, and to pray to Heaven for the aſſiſtance of the Spirit; Since this appears to be ſo neceſſary in relation to our weakneſs, and our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And, certainly, what is ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for our ſafe conduct to that Haven where we would be, and which God deſigns for our eternal reſt and ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, from all tempeſts and future ſtorms; There is no reaſon why we ſhould diſtruſt the Spirits influence
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:100880:129"/>
and operation; Nor to make our ſelves uncapable of the favour, by te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying our unwillingneſs to receive it, by perpetually oppoſing, and diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt it.</p>
               <p>For (<hi>Laſtly,</hi>) this influence of the holy Spirit upon the minds of holy and good men is, from the Scripture, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly certain to thoſe that, at once, both want, and beg, it, and do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themſelves for the reception of it: Why, otherwiſe, ſhould our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour give this aſſurance to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>that God gives the holy Spirit to thoſe that ask him?</hi> Nay, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of thoſe promiſes in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that engage Gods truth and faithfulneſs, to aſſiſt good men in the diſcharge of their duty, and to ſupport them under all their miſery and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, if we were altogether left to our ſelves, to purſue the dictates of our own reaſon, and to ſtand only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our own leggs without any ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our help or influence? The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>that the Spirit does help our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,</hi> (Rom. 8.26.): But this would be falſe, if we had, either, none that required his aſſiſtance; Or that he would not condeſcend to ſupply
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:100880:129"/>
our wants. S. <hi>John</hi> makes this <hi>vincu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum unionis</hi>; this bond of union, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt and us, the Spirit of God to be a character by which we may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh our ſelves; <hi>Becauſe he has given us of his Spirit,</hi> (1 John 4.13.). And S. <hi>Paul</hi> fully agrees with S. <hi>John: For</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>if any man has not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his,</hi> (Rom. 8.9.). I know with what great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry theſe and other Texts have been reſtrained to that Divine temper of mind, by which we know, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, our condition; This indeed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the gracious effect of the holy Spirits co-opperating with our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, is by no means to be ſeparated in our judgment upon our ſelves; And we have no other way to judge of the cauſe, but by this Divine and glorious effect: But yet, where this is viſible in an holy life, and virtuous actions, we have no reaſon to exclude the cauſe; Eſpecially when it is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally included in the expreſſion; For the Apoſtle ſuppoſes this Spirit, that Chriſtians have, to be <hi>the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead</hi>; Nay a branch, alſo, of that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which ſhall hereafter raiſe us too:
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:100880:130"/>
For, it follows; <hi>He that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken our mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in us.</hi> Becauſe our Bodies are here the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt; God will not ſuffer them to remain eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in their ruiues; But will, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, re-edifie, and raiſe, them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were once the habitation of his Spirit. Hence are Believers ſaid to be <hi>ſealed with the holy Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which is the earneſt of their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,</hi> (Epheſ. 1.13.). And, therefore, they are adviſed, in the ſame Epiſtle, <hi>not to grieve this holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, whereby they are ſealed unto the day of their redemption,</hi> (Eph. 4.30.). Now, though we may be ſaid to be ſealed up for Heaven, by a Divine temper of mind upon Earth; that this prepares us for future glory, and that, if this diſpoſition be not in us, we are none of Chriſts: Yet it would be as harſh a ſpeech as can be admitted in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny language, to ſay that this holy temper of mind ſhall raiſe us up at the laſt day; Since the wicked are then raiſed too: Or to ſay, that any man voluntarily grieves this Divine temper and diſpoſition of mind, when
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:100880:130"/>
the man then grieves himſelf. Theſe expreſſions therefore muſt, certainly, intend more than this; And they can ſcarcely admit of a fair interpretation, without expounding them of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit of God, which, now co-o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating with our faculties, produces in us divine tempers and diſpoſitions, and ſo prepares us for that inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which he ſhall raiſe us up from our graves to poſſeſs. The Holy Ghoſt was firſt promiſed to the Apoſtles and Chriſtian Diſciples, under the names and notion of a <hi>Comforter, and the Spirit of truth</hi>; and how could he be both, or either, if he did not influence their minds with joy and knowledge? <hi>The Spirit it ſelf</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>bears witneſs with our Spirits, that we are the children of God,</hi> (Rom. 8.16.). It did not only teſtifie unto others by thoſe Miracles that did confirm their Religion, and conſequently proved thoſe that did ſincerely embrace it to be born of God, as well as their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; But it evidenced theſe things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, to their own conſciences, by a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred benediction, and a Divine, and more immediate concurrence with them, when they compared their
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:100880:131"/>
lives with the Rules of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; And, conſequently proves to them, <hi>that they were heirs of God, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heirs with Chriſt</hi>; which is the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Apoſtle is there proſecuting, to give them comfort in the midſt of tribulation, and to animate their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and reſolution, againſt the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of that preſent time. The graces and virtues viſible in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians life are ſaid, in Scripture, to be <hi>the fruits of the Spirit,</hi> (Gal. 5.22.). Not only that they are the fruits of the Goſpel, which is, ſometimes, phraſed by the word <hi>Spirit,</hi> in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe legal obſervations which, being carnal ordinances, are called <hi>fleſh:</hi> But, they are ſo the fruits of the Spirit, that, as he firſt dictated the Rule, ſo, does he alſo concurr to the actions. If the Evil Spirit could car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Chriſt to be tempted in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; Shall we not think the good Spirit could relieve him too! <hi>If the Prince of the power of the Air, can be a Spirit working in the children of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> (Epheſ. 2.2.); Shall we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Holy Ghoſt leſs active, or powerful, to work in thoſe who reſign their wills, by the direction of his
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:100880:131"/>
Laws, to his moſt ſacred and ſafe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct? The promiſe of life and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſalvation is made to us upon this condition, <hi>that through the Spirit we mortifie the deeds of the body,</hi> (Rom. 8.13.): And though many things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with the influences of the holy Spirit to effect ſo great and victorious triumphs; Yet all cauſes act with a dependence upon this glorious power which works in us both to will and to do, when we prepare our ſelves for its reception, by endeavouring, what in us layes, <hi>to work out our ſalvation with fear and trembling,</hi> (Philip. 2.12, 13.). Preaching, Prayers, Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and hearing the word of God, are ordinary means to convert a ſinner from the error of his way; And yet S. <hi>Paul</hi> (though he ſufficiently magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Preachers Office) ſayes, <hi>that we are only workers together with God,</hi> (2 Cor. 6.1.). And, 'tis well for us all, when God aſſiſts, and bleſſes, our endeavours: And, God grant that thoſe who attend ſuch ſacred inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, being ſwift to hear, may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſo ſwift alſo as to depart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a bleſſing.</p>

               <p>HAving in the former Chapter, in ſome meaſure, proved that the Holy Spirit of God deſcended, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the predictions of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and the promiſe of our Saviour; I ſhall now enquire into his work and buſineſs in this world, amongſt men who were rational and intellectual Beings; Who might (as ſome men are apt to think) have, well enough, propagated Chriſtian Doctrine, when they had heard it from our Saviours own mouth; and had, for ſome time, daily converſation with him; With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other new aſſiſtance, beſides the miraculous gift of tongues. And what employment the Spirit of God could poſſibly have among other men; As they will not be Religious enough to know; So, truly, they are yet, very much to ſeek. However I ſhall adventure (without calling any men names) to ſhew, according to
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:100880:133"/>
my ſteady, and long continued (though mean) thoughts, what the ſacred Spirit of God has done, and yet does, to guide men into the wayes of truth. In the promiſes where Chriſt (who was truth it ſelf) engages for the Spirits corning into the World in a more plentiful manner than in forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing periods; He ſeems to be deſcribed as a perſon different from the Father and the Son: And I ſhall inſtance in one eminent promiſe to this purpoſe, (<hi>John</hi> 16.13.): <hi>Howbeit, when he, the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth.</hi> Now that our great, and moſt bleſſed, Redeermer of men ſpeaks of a perſon here; And not of what is ſaid to be an <hi>afflatus divinus</hi> only, (as ſome have interpreted this place, to void the Doctrine of the moſt glorious Trinity; Which is the great, and, I had almoſt ſaid, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing Article of the Chriſtian Faith) is plain from the terms of this Text; Becauſe <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> is prefix'd to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; <hi>He, the Spirit of truth</hi>; And this latter part, (which is a Periphraſis) does but acquaint us who the Perſon was; Even the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, the third Perſon in the moſt
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:100880:133"/>
Glorious Trinity, God bleſſed for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore. Now this profound myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Trinity, however inexplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it may ſeem to be, in all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, to the underſtandings of men, who are loth to think that any Beings are above their great capacities and reaſonings: Yet it has been alwayes believ'd by the Orthodox, through all the Ages of the Chriſtian Church; And it is a point ſufficient (if there were no other) to baffle the Heathen Objection againſt our Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> That it cannot be Divine, becauſe there is no Myſtery in it. But I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign not to treat, in this diſcourſe, with any that own not Chriſt to be the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>; The great King and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the World: And therefore ſhall only acquaint the Reader; That Jeſus himſelf ſeems to take great care to inſinuate, and fix, this funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental point in the particular promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Holy Ghoſt; Leſt any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, mighty in reaſon, and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in argument, ſhould refuſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſuch a Myſtery as this, when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently revealed, becauſe their own reaſon is not able to conclude the thing, or their language cannot fully
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:100880:134"/>
explain it. In the fourteenth of Saint <hi>Johns</hi> Goſpel, the ſixteenth Verſe, our bleſſed Saviour acquaints his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, for their comfort and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, with this great promiſe; <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide with you for ever; Even the Spirit of truth.</hi> Here is one praying; another ſending; and a third given. So is it alſo at the twenty ſixth Verſe of the ſame Chapter; <hi>But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghoſt, whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will ſend in my name, he ſhall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatſoever I have ſaid unto you.</hi> Here is the Father ſending, in the Sons name, or (upon his account) the Holy Ghoſt, to teach the Apoſtles thoſe things which our Saviour had more briefly hinted to them; And ſuch things alſo which the Apoſtles, through prejudice, could not then receive: And, to bring thoſe parts of the Chriſtian Doctrine to their remembrance, which they, through human frailty, might forget: That ſo they might be fitted to be the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhers, and the ſacred and infallible Pen-men of the moſt excellent Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:100880:134" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Chriſtian Religion; And that it might, by their means, be, in its purity, free from mixture, deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all the ſucceeding generations of mankind. And now (by the way), what a ſlender plea have any Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts, of this age, for any new reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of Doctrine beyond what Chriſt preached to the World? Since the Holy Ghoſt himſelf was never promiſed to the very Apoſtles, to any ſuch end and purpoſe. For, it cannot, with any reaſon, be ſuppoſed, but that Chriſt whilſt he was preaching in the world, delivered a compleat Body of his Doctrine: And had he not; (whatever becomes of a <hi>jus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinum,</hi> for the government of the Church) He had, certainly, been leſs careful than <hi>Moſes.</hi> And, yet, the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſays; <hi>He was faithful to him that made, or appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him; as, alſo, Moſes was faithful in all his houſe,</hi> (Heb. 3.2.). But, not to endeavour to work Miracles, and reſtore ſight to ſuch as are reſolved to be ſtill blind, and to ſhut their eyes againſt the light of the Sun; becauſe it will diſcover that their deeds are evil, when darkneſs does at once as
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:100880:135"/>
well increaſe, as inſpire, wilfulneſs or melancholy: To leave, alſo, any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explication of the Doctrine of the Trinity; Which I have hinted to you, as well to mind you of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of a neceſſary Feſtival of our Church, as to cauſe men to adore what they cannot underſtand; to admire that with which they cannot be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar; to praiſe what they cannot comprehend; and to believe that Myſtery which is plainly revealed; Though they cannot unriddle the thing it ſelf: To come more cloſely therefore to the buſineſs I have in hand; The Holy Ghoſt promiſed, is ſaid to be <hi>the Spirit of truth:</hi> And this not only, (1.) Becauſe he is <hi>Spiritus verax</hi> (as <hi>Slichtingius</hi> would have it, to comport with his endeared notion of <hi>afflatus divinus</hi>); Nor, only, is he a true Spirit, either in original, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration; in oppoſition to what is groſs, and ſenſual: Nor (2.) becauſe he truly and really proceeds from the Father; And conſequently has Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority enough to produce a faith in us, which muſt be Divine: Nor (3.) becauſe, being in unity with that <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son, from whom he does proceed,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:100880:135"/>
he muſt be truth it ſelf,</hi> (as S. <hi>John</hi> ſtiles him: 1. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 5. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.); and, conſequently, cannot be guilty of a falſhood, unleſs we ſuppoſe that God may lie; which the Apoſtle aſſures us is impoſſible, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18.): And reaſon alſo concludes ſuch a Being to be void of this, to whom we aſcribe all poſſible perfection. But (<hi>Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>) he is called a <hi>Spirit of truth,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to his Office and Employment; Becauſe he guides others into truth; Though from the precedent accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and account given, of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation, we may reaſonably infer his capacity to inſtruct, and guide, others into all truth: And that the Apoſtles, who were ſo miraculouſly guided, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered nothing to be the rule of mens lives, but what was true and came from God, and therefore what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, is to be both believed, and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And thus I am come to the laſt and principal particular, that I aim at in this Part of my Diſcourſe, in which is contained the Office of the Holy Ghoſt in this particular, and the ſubſtance of this promiſe; <hi>viz. He will guide you into all truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:100880:136"/>Now this Conduct of the <hi>Spirit of truth,</hi> muſt be conſidered two wayes, (1.) As it related to the Apoſtles, and firſt Diſciples of our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. (2.) As it concerns the whole Church of Chriſt, that is, or ſhall be, Militant in this World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let us conſider the <hi>holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God,</hi> as influencing and directing the Apoſtles, and firſt planters of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, to whom this promiſe was principally made; And, as it did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern all, ſo was it promiſed to all, to guide them into all thoſe truths that compleated the Articles of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith, or were to be left as ſtanding directions for the lives and actions of thoſe, who ſhould embrace this Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. He does not call S. <hi>Peter</hi> out, and make this promiſe of infallibility to him, excluding all the reſt from this advantage: Nor does he here ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt him in the name of the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; as he does in that other Text, on which the Pope ſuperſtructs his Supremacy: We find, indeed, S. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> S. <hi>Philip,</hi> and S. <hi>Jude</hi> interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his diſcourſe, by propoſing que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions for him to explain: But, the laſt time he ſpake to <hi>Peter,</hi> we find him at
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:100880:136"/>
once rebuking his confidence, and fore-telling his ſin; Nay, a crime ſo great, as <hi>to deny him,</hi> (John 13.38.). And, therefore, all the reſt of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervenient diſcourſe, can concern him no more than it did his Brethren: And 'tis well if, at preſent, it did as much; which, if others would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with, we might eaſily grant it, and muſt do ſo, if we would not prove his Epiſtles to want an inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from above. This promiſe then, concerning the Apoſtles and primitive planters of the Chriſtian Doctrine, ſo far as it was uſeful to their extraordinary conduct, we muſt examine, and enquire what aſſiſtance the Spirit gave them, <hi>to guide them into all truth.</hi> And this he did in five par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> By an improvement of their underſtandings; Ordering, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting, the Ideas of their minds, that they might be able to frame adequate conceptions of the truths, which they were to deliver to the World; And <hi>as he that created the eye, can ſee, and he that formed the ear, can hear</hi>; So he that made the Soul it ſelf, and endued it with all its faculties, and
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:100880:137"/>
powers, muſt needs be able to impreſs the underſtanding with any notions he is pleaſed to infuſe by the powerful operations of his Holy Spirit. Now that he did exert ſuch an influence, had we no teſtimony<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures themſelves, will eaſily appear to any ſober and conſiderate inquirer, that ſhall compare the education, and condition, of the Apoſtles with thoſe admirable Doctrines, which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto the world. Though S. <hi>Paul</hi> was bred at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> yet his learned Education made him but the greater perſecutor of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and more prejudiced againſt the Doctrine of our Saviour; 'Till he was converted by a Miracle, and a light had firſt dazled his eyes, and ſtruck him blind, whilſt a greater did illuminate his underſtanding, and, by its brighter glory, darken and blot out thoſe prejudicate notions that ſeemed before to irradiate his mind: Though S. <hi>Luke</hi> was born and bred in an Univerſity, the City of <hi>Antioch,</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Syria,</hi> a place fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Schools of literature; Though he had applied himſelf to the ſtudy of Phyſick, to which Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:100880:137"/>
was a neceſſary preparative; Though be had ſtudied in the Schools of <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſeaſoned his mind with learned accompliſhments, ſo far improving the abilities of his nature; And, though, to all this, he was a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Proſelyte, and ſo far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Kingdom of God; Yet all this ſignified but little, and would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have oppoſed Chriſtianity with the greater ſtrength, and more ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, had he not been firſt converted to this Religion, and accompanied Saint <hi>Paul</hi>; received the notices of thoſe early, and firſt, tranſactions of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and his Diſciples, and been gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Holy Spirit of God, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording the Hiſtory and Doctrine of our Saviour, and his Apoſtles. But, if we make the ſtricteſt enquiry into thoſe twelve Apoſtles, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſent to preach his Doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the World, we ſhall find them all by their Education, either too much prejudiced, or unprepared, to invent, or propagate, ſuch a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: The greater part were a few rugged and inconſiderable Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that knew only to catch Fiſh, and mend their Nets when they were
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:100880:138"/>
broken, and either eat, or ſell their Fiſh when they had caught it. And how unfit theſe were to preach rules of life to the world, to make known Riddles, and explain Myſteries; To maintain their Faith againſt the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſputes of <hi>Rabbies,</hi> and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, or to commit a Syſtem of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine to writing for future ages to live by, and that it might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the rule for mens actions; Let any reaſonable men judge. It muſt needs, therefore, be a greater argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a larger inſpiration, that theſe men were ſo ſlenderly prepared by nature or Education: And, by how much the meaner theſe were, by ſo much the more powerful were the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of the Spirit, <hi>to guide them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all truth.</hi> But, beſides the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this, we have a more ſure word of Prophecy, to aſcertain their inſpiration from above; <hi>Since all Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is given by inſpiration of God</hi>; (2 Tim. 3.16.). And, ſince no man can poſſibly know thoſe Laws by which God will govern the World, 'till he pleaſes himſelf to make them known; It muſt needs be, that he muſt impregnate the minds, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:100880:138"/>
the underſtandings, of thoſe whom he deſigns to be the Pen-men of his Laws; And this he did, as to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and the Prophets under the Old, ſo, to the Apoſtles in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by his <hi>Holy Spirit:</hi> Therefore was he <hi>to teach them all things,</hi> by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming their underſtandings, (<hi>John</hi> 14.26.). And, <hi>by guiding them into all truth,</hi> (John 16.13.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Holy Spirit of truth, guided the Apoſtles, and firſt publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhers of his ſacred Doctrines, by quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their memories; That what their Maſter had, before, taught them, the Diſciples, now, might remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for the benefit of others. The memories of men, by reaſon of their own weakneſs, and the multitude of objects which daily preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the mind, and that variety of converſe, and numerous diſturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they meet with in a World, full of noiſe and humour, are very apt to ſlip many things which they ought to regiſter, and, when they are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to loſe the record. Hence is that admonition of the Author to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews; that we ought to give the more earneſt heed to the things which we have
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:100880:139"/>
heard, leſt at any time we ſhould let them ſlip</hi>; (Heb. 2.1.). The Apoſtles, therefore, (who were men of like paſſions with our ſelves), had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary power aſſiſting their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories; That thoſe things might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain recur, which they had heard from our Saviour, at that time when by his-abſence he was uncapable of repeating, and orally to deliver that Doctrine which, before, they had the advantage of hearing: The Spirit, then, by an immediate impreſſion, put their Spirits into ſuch a motion, and propoſed ſuch objects to their conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and underſtanding, and ſo rang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the particles of the brain, that the ſame images preſented themſelves, and they had the ſame Ideas, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions which poſſeſs'd their minds, when the trutns were firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to them: Or, if I may be any way extravagant in endeavouring to deſcribe the manner of framing this miraculous effect; Yet ſure I am that ſome way or other, this was done, or the promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt was not fully accompliſhed; <hi>For</hi> (ſayes the Text) <hi>the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghoſt, ſhall teach you all things,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:100880:139"/>
and bring all things to your remembrance, whatſoever I have ſaid unto you,</hi> (John 14.26.).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Holy Spirit of Truth inclined the wills of the Apoſtles and firſt Planters of Chriſtianity, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh thoſe things which were impreſs'd upon their underſtandings, and their memories now perfectly retained; and to commit theſe truths to Writing, that future Ages might be able to read, what they could neither ſee nor hear: To exhibit no more than what they had received for the Divine Rule; and to live, alſo, ſuitable to their Doctrine, to avoid the ſuſpicion of Cheat and Impoſture. Now, though this influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence might ſeem to be unneceſſary to ſuch as had imbibed the Chriſtian Doctrine with their underſtandings, becauſe their wills might ſeem imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to follow what their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings dictated to be true; and the reaſonableneſs, and admirable excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of this Doctrine might be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive enough to perſwade, as well to its practice, as belief: Yet we find, by a woful experience, that the wills of men do not alwayes follow the dictates of their underſtandings; But that we
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:100880:140"/>
violate Laws, which yet we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced to be true and good: If it were not ſo, few men would embrace vice, and offer injury to the Precepts of Chriſtianity; which all men, of reaſon and diſcretion, muſt needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be excellent in themſelves, and infallibly ſealed and authorized by God; who has by a miraculous hand, atteſted them to the World. It was neceſſary therefore, that the Apoſtles and firſt Publiſhers of the Goſpel ſhould be made willing, as well as able, to accompliſh all thoſe things which might tend to the propagation and aſſurance of the Goſpel: And we cannot conjecture that ſo ſudden an alteration could be made, as we find in the Apoſtles, who, by their Trade and Education, were rough and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, (this being generally obſerved of Mariners) ſo as to be brought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge ſuch gentle precepts ſo oppoſite to their cuſtoms, and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, without a ſuperiour influence mollifying their tempers, and the powerful operation and perſwaſions of God <hi>to make them willing in the day of his power.</hi> When <hi>Paul</hi> therefore was converted by a Miracle, and
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:100880:140"/>
brought to the acknowledgement of that <hi>Jeſus</hi> whom he had perſecuted; that glorious light which ſhined up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his underſtanding, rectified alſo the perverſeneſs of his will, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined that to follow his Conviction; ſo that he became not <hi>diſobedient to the Heavenly Viſion, but ſhewed both to the Jews and Gentiles, that they ſhould repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance,</hi> (Acts 26.19, 20.).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Holy Ghoſt led the Apoſtles into all truths of the Goſpel, by working Miracles to confirm their Doctrine. Theſe are the great Seal of Heaven, that ſufficiently authorize whatever they are brought to give teſtimony unto: For theſe being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther viſible effects beyond the power of natural Cauſes, or ſome ſtrange and extraordinary alterations of nature, by laying a reſtraint upon its uſual ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; Or cauſing it to take a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent courſe by a ſtrange compoſition of ſecond Cauſes, or a powerful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of ſome Agent not included in the immediate Cauſe; They argue ſome ſuperiour operation: And we muſt attribute them to God, or the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:100880:141"/>
Devil. Accordingly have men uſed to difference them, as they tend to a good, or a bad, deſign: Hence we find in the Old Teſtament, two characters of a <hi>falſe Prophet,</hi> and conſequently as many of a <hi>true,</hi> as I have hinted immediately before, (1) If the ſign, or wonder, that he gives for confirmation of what he pretends, in its deſign deſtroys natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Religion, <hi>i. e.</hi> what proceeds from the common reaſon of men. <hi>For if there ariſe among you a Prophet or a drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of dreams, and the ſign or wonder come to paſs which he gives thee;</hi> If this be wrought to draw men from the Worſhip of the only one God, to pay Divine homage to a falſe one, or to many; The ſign was permitted only to prove them; And ſuch a Prophet was not only to be accounted falſe; But to be put to death for his villany and impoſture, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 13. at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing). (2.) When the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was not true, and the thing foretold followed not, 'twas a ſign that the Prophecy was bold and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, and what he, that is a God of truth, never commiſſioned the Prophet to deliver, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 18.22.). When ſigns, therefore, and wonders,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:100880:141"/>
were really effected, that tended to the advancement of Religion; eſtabliſhing what was written in mens hearts, and deſtroying all that God had forbidden; and fixing nothing contradictory to what had been confirmed to the <hi>Jews,</hi> but what did prefigure this new me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and, at ſuch a particular period of the World was predicted that it ſhould be deſtroyed; They muſt needs confirm the truth which thoſe men delivered, who had ſufficient power and authority to work them. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were things rationally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be ſufficient ſigns of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Commiſſion of thoſe who were permitted to work them; when they carried, eſpecially, ſuch characters of a Divine Power in their nature, or in their frequency, and continuation, as no Devil could be ſuppoſed to have granted to him; Nor any man could poſſibly effect to do miſchief in the World: Thus, when <hi>Moſes</hi> delivered the Law, his Speech was followed with Thunderings and Lightnings, and the noiſe of the Trumpet, and the ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Mountain (<hi>Deut.</hi> 20.18.). Which ſufficiently confirmed the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of the Moral, and prepared the

people for an obedient reception of the Judicial, and Ceremonial, Law. And thus was it alſo at the delivery of the Goſpel. When S. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> ſent two of his Diſciples unto Chriſt, to know whether he were the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> that was to give Laws unto the World; Our Saviour returns this anſwer; <hi>Tell John what things ye have ſeen and heard; how that the blind ſee, the lame walk, the lepers are cleanſed, the deaf hear, the dead are raiſed,</hi> (Luke 7.22.). Theſe Miracles, ſo full of goodneſs and Divine influence, were a ſufficient atteſtation of his Doctrine. Hence he makes the ſame reply, alſo, to the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they propoſed the ſame queſtion: <hi>The works that I do in my Fathers name, they bear witneſs of me,</hi> (John 10.25.). And therefore ſayes he of the ſame perſons; <hi>If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had had no ſin; If I had not done Miracles far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Moſes and the Prophets, whom yet, upon the authority of what theſe did, they believe; they might reaſonably have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their Law againſt me; Which, then, had been bleſs'd with as noble an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, as what I now pretend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver:
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:100880:142"/>
But now that I do ſuch works which no man ever yet did before me; they have no cloke at all for their ſin, nor any excuſe for their unbelief,</hi> (John 15.24.). Now, as Miracles argued the truth and Authority of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Doctrine; So they led his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples into the ſame truth: For, from thoſe Miracles which they ſaw him do in confirmation of his Doctrine, they might reaſonably be induced to believe what he delivered to them; and when the power was yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to themſelves, they might well inferr that they were ſtill guided into the truth: Since the Holy Ghoſt thus ſealed it to themſelves and others; and they had ſo powerful, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, a teſtimony to what they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and delivered. Thus when they had received that Commiſſion from our Saviour, <hi>to go into the world, and to preach the Goſpel to every creature; They went forth and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with ſigns following,</hi> (Mark 16.20.). The ſame is atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Authour to the <hi>Hebrews, that God bare the Apoſtles witneſs, with ſigns and wonders, and divers miracles,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:100880:143"/>
and diſtributions of the Holy Ghoſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will,</hi> (Heb. 2.4.). This is the teſtimony he gave unto the truth, by the Miracles which were wrought by thoſe who publiſhed and owned the Doctrine of our Saviour, evidence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Divinity to themſelves, and others: <hi>For we</hi> (ſay the Apoſtles) <hi>are witneſſes of theſe things, and ſo is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Holy Ghoſt, whom God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them that obey him,</hi> (Acts 5.32.).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The Holy Spirit guided the Apoſtles and Primitive Diſciples into all truths of the Goſpel, by an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ſupport in the midſt of great, and raging, perſecutions. Both Scripture, and Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, informs us, what trials and conflicts theſe had for the profeſſion of their Faith, and a firm adheſion to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion. Their whole lives were a continued tragedy, which did not end, but in blood, and death: The ſtate of the Church was ſuch in thoſe dayes, that All <hi>that would live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, muſt ſuffer perſecution,</hi> (2 Tim. 3.12.). Nothing but cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties from their ſevere Adverſaries, attended the profeſſion and publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:100880:143"/>
of the Goſpel; Which was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal foundation of that Argument, of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> to prove the hopes and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Reſurrection, <hi>If, in this life only, we have hope in Chriſt, we are of all men moſt miſerable,</hi> (1 Cor. 15.19.). Hence the Apoſtle argues the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to patience and courage in the midſt of ſufferings, from the reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon what they had already over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; That they might not, by a future cowardize, loſe the reward of their former adventures. <hi>Call to mind</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>the former dayes, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions:</hi> By having their Eſtates made a prey to their enemies; by being made a gazing ſtock to the world; by bearing reproaches and tortures themſelves, and being compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions to thoſe, who were ſo uſed, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.32.). <hi>They gat their bread with the peril of their lives</hi>; As the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is (<hi>Lament.</hi> 5.9.); <hi>And, for the ſake of Chriſt they were killed all the day long, and no more accounted of than as innocent ſheep appointed to the ſlaughter;</hi> As S. <hi>Paul</hi> applies that of the Pſalmiſt, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.36.). And, if we view the ends of their lives, we ſhall find na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:100880:144"/>
alwayes anticipated, and they ſnatched away by a violent fate, ſtill ſwimming to Heaven in their blood. One is crucified, another beheaded, a third is ſtoned, a fourth has his brains beat out with a Club; Another is hanged by the neck againſt a Pillar, after whips and ſcourges had made a Prologue to the Tragedy; One is flead alive, another thruſt through with a Spear; and a third dragg'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the craggy part of a ſtreet, till his fleſh was torn off, and horrid pains compell'd him to expire. It would be endleſs to account for the diſmal tortures which the Apoſtles, and Primitive Diſciples endured, their whole age being full of clouds and ſtorms; And the releaſe from one torment, was but the entrance upon another: They daily went in danger of their lives, which, were, indeed, but continued deaths, and repeated tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies: Now, what a wonderful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation muſt this add to their own faith, as well as ſeal its truth to poſterity, that they ſhould have ſuch multiplied tortures, as anxious and cruel, as the malice of enraged Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries could invent and execute; and
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:100880:144"/>
yet would not accept deliverance, if they muſt purchaſe it with the denial of their Faith; They muſt needs be animated to the belief of thoſe truths, in the profeſſion of which they were ſo encouraged, by a Divine power, and the comforts of the Holy Ghoſt, that they ſuffered torments beyond their own ſtrength to endure; Nor did the rage and perſecution of their Adverſaries overcome them; Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when we ſhall conſider too, that they could ſmile in the midſt of flames, and look upon their own blood with joy; When they could account Martyrdom a Crown, and ſuch deaths as were moſt painful and cruel, they could travel through, as the neareſt paſſage to their eternal reward: Which, whilſt they viewed in a ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and well fixed contemplation, they were able to conclude their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be light, and to endure but for a moment; And that the future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward overballanced them both in weight and duration. They could glory in what the juſtice and cuſtome of the world accounted ſhame; <hi>and rejoice that they were deemed worthy to ſuffer for it</hi> (Acts 5.41.). They were
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:100880:145"/>
alwayes dying, and yet lived; were able to account tortures chaſtiſements, and could ſtill rejoyce in the midſt of ſorrows, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>They could approve themſelves the Miniſters of God in pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in afflictions, in neceſſities, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, in ſtripes, in impriſonments</hi>; and that black Catalogue which S. <hi>Paul</hi> has recorded to poſterity; It muſt certainly convince both them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others, that the hand of God did yet ſupport them, and that the Doctrine was true which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, for which they were miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly prepared, and now ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their ſufferings for it, by the comforts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt. They knew themſelves to be a company of rude and illiterate men, (or at leaſt ſome of them were) not poliſhed either by art or Education, for converſe with the learned <hi>Rabbies</hi> amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> or the ſubtil Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers amongſt the <hi>Gentiles</hi>; and yet they baffled, and could ſilence both, had not their force reached far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than their argument. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (ſayes S. <hi>Paul) where is the wiſe? where is the Scribe? where is the diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this world? Hath not God made
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:100880:145"/>
fooliſh the wiſdom of this world?</hi> (1 Cor. 1.20.). S. <hi>Stephen</hi>; who was but a Deacon to the Apoſtles, was yet ſo full of faith, and ſo endowed with the power of the Holy Ghoſt, that he did not only amaze the people with the greatneſs of his Miracles; but when many diſputants were rang'd againſt him, he did not only ſmartly encounter, but overcame them too; <hi>For they were not able to reſiſt the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and the Spirit by which he ſpake,</hi> (Acts 6.10.). They were fain to leave their reaſoning, and conſult their ſubtilty; and had no way to ſtop his mouth, but by a ſhower of ſtones, that took away his breath; What could ſuch men as theſe have done, when they were brought before the Council of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or Tribunals of the <hi>Romans?</hi> Where all the ſubtle quirks of Law, and all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions that malice could contrive, ſhould be uſed to entangle their innocence by craft; had not the Holy Ghoſt aſſiſted them in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their defence, looſened their tongues, and informed their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings. This was what was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them before, and now as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:100880:146"/>
and fully accompliſhed; For when our Saviour ſent forth his twelve Apoſtles, and told them how they ſhould acouter themſelves; what were the contents of their Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and how they ſhould demean themſelves: He acquaints them alſo what dangers they were likely to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with; They were ſent forth as <hi>Sheep</hi> in the midſt of <hi>Wolves</hi>; Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one would endeavour to devour them; <hi>And therefore they ſhould be ſcourged in the Synagogues; and be brought before Kings and Governours,</hi> upon their Maſters account. <hi>But</hi> (ſayes he), <hi>When they ſhall deliver you up, let it not trouble you,</hi> that ye are not well skill'd in the Law, where ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty may cauſe a Criminal to eſcape, when ignorance may draw the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent into puniſhment: <hi>For it ſhall be given you in that ſame hour what ye ſhall ſpeak; For it is not ye that ſpeak, but the Spirit of your Father which ſpeaketh in you,</hi> (Matth. 10.19.). Now men that had ſuch extraordinary confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their Apoſtleſhip, and found theſe aſſiſtances from the Holy Ghoſt, muſt needs be fully convinced of thoſe things that were imprinted on their
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:100880:146"/>
underſtandings, and would atteſt their Divine authority unto others, to whom they were obliged to declare and publiſh them, when they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were ſo fully perſuaded, as not only to ſuffer all the inconveniencies of this life, that could be brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them by the ſubtilty of the Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of the World, but all the tortures and cruel deaths, which malice was able to inflict. And thus did the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit of truth, guide the Apoſtles <hi>into all truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet (notwithſtanding all this) It muſt be conſidered that though the Apoſtles and primitive Diſciples of our Saviour, had thus the conduct of the holy Spirit; Yet it was never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to guide them into all truths of all kinds; For this were to extend a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe beyond what was ever deſigned by the Holy Ghoſt. Truth is a word of a large interpretation; it runs through all Arts and Sciences, and is as comprehenſive as all the objects and underſtandings of men: For, whereever there is a conformity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the object and a rightly prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red intellect, there is truth: Nay, there is too often truth in that which we
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:100880:147"/>
do not underſtand. The Spirit therefore did not deſign, in his ſacred and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible conduct, to extend the capacities of the ſacred Apoſtles, to an infinite comprehenſion, ſo as to cauſe them to know <hi>omne ſcibile</hi>; every thing that is capable to be known: For that were not only to make a new creation, but to put them beyond the capacity of Creatures; Nay, though he is Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, to go beyond his own power, in making Beings as infinite as Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Nor did the Spirit in the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Apoſtles <hi>into all truth,</hi> intend their information, in the truths of all the Arts and Sciences extant in the World: He did not deſign to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in the art of <hi>Syllogiſm</hi>; Nor that they ſhould read natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy to the World; He did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to teach them to call the <hi>Stars</hi> by their names; or that they ſhould, by virtue of his inſtruction, know their ſeveral motions, diſtances, or altitudes: He did not intend Aphoriſms in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick; Or to give to them Geometrical proportions; Nor to breed them cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and expert Artificers, though ſome of theſe have made themſelves Apoſtles; Nor to teach them the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:100880:147"/>
of Arithmetick; Or the Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical ſignatures of things, or times and ſeaſons; For, theſe were not for them to <hi>know; becauſe the Father had put them into his own power,</hi> (Acts 1.7.). And therefore, as they were never ſo proud and bold, ſo neither were they ſo unlucky, as the Pope, who muſt needs condemn a point in Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, and the tenet of <hi>Antipodes,</hi> for a deſtroying Hereſie: So little did he know the univerſal Empire he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, that he did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the extent of it, nor the Figure or Bounds, or Inhabitants of that Earth over which he yet pretended an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. The Holy Ghoſt, therefore, guided the Apoſtles into thoſe truths only, in Divinity, which included the full Doctrine of the Goſpel; which our Saviour delivered, that they might be able to preach them to the preſent age, and commit them to writing for the uſe of all ſucceeding Generations. The Spirit was not given to them to make them great Hiſtorians, or Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers; but Chriſtians; and to capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citate them, to be the planters and founders of Churches, not the poſts and ſtandards of diſpute; Or to be the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:100880:148"/>
leaders of Sects and Factions in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy: They were to erect a Pillar of truth ſetled upon a firm foundation, Chriſt himſelf ſupporting the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and this neither for Paſquins or Poetry, but for a Rule and directory of ſtanding Religion and Devotion.</p>

               <p>THE ſouls of men whilſt hous'd in theſe bodies of clay, are dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and obſcured, notwithſtanding all the windows of ſenſe, to let in the light of external objects to an intercourſe with the mind: For ſuppoſing our ſenſes could alwayes make true and exact repreſentations to our ſouls, which yet we know are often decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; yet theſe could only convey ſuch things as are the proper objects of the ſouls of men: Thoſe of an higher, and more exalted, nature, that are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of an image, muſt needs eſcape the perception of our outward ſenſes; and, if reaſon it ſelf, when moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entangled from thoſe fetters which our ſenſes too often impoſe, ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make propoſitions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences about the eſſences of thoſe things, whoſe ſpiritual natures evade our ſenſe, our notions could not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equate to the things themſelves, nor
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:100880:149"/>
could we fully comprehend what is infinite, nor have a poſitive Idea of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Beings, though reaſon might conclude their exiſtence. Hence is it that all our definitions and deſcriptions of theſe are therefore imperfect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe negative; and, though we may conclude what they are not, we never could, by humane power, yet reſolve compleatly what they are; which makes Divine Revelation neceſſary, and that we ſhould have faith beyond our reaſon, though we never believe without reaſon, to aſſure us of the authority we confide in: This being, therefore, our ſtate and condition in this World, we muſt as well praiſe Gods Goodneſs, as admire his Power for ſending us that Spirit of Truth which guides us into all truth, that is neceſſary to conduct us to eternal happineſs. Now this Promiſe I told you, I would conſider two wayes, (1.) As it related to the Apoſtles, and firſt Diſciples of our Lord and Saviour. (2.) As it concerns the whole Church of Chriſt, that is, or ſhall be militant on the earth. The firſt of theſe is already diſpatched. And therefore I now proceed to the ſecond, To view
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:100880:149"/>
the Promiſe of the Spirits guidance, as it concerns the Church throughout the ſeveral Ages, and Periods, of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World. I have already proved the divine influence on the minds of men, (though its immediate operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is too difficult to be explained, as to the manner of its energy and work), and that we have no reaſon to disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the thing, for that we know not the manner of its operation: What, therefore, is now to be diſcourſed (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the truth of its influence in general, and that extraordinary aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance he gave unto the Apoſtles) is; How the Holy Spirit of God poſſeſſes the minds of thoſe with truth, who make themſelves, by holy diſpoſitions, and a due exerciſe of their rational fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, capable to receive it; and what truths thoſe are that the Spirit of God guides men into?</p>
               <p>As to the firſt; ſuppoſing that which has been already proved; That the Apoſtles were inſpired from above to receive a full revelation of thoſe truths, (by opening their underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and quickning their memories) that concern the ſalvation of mankind, and that they committed them to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:100880:150"/>
faithfully recording them for the uſe of poſterity; and that theſe are to be ſtanding rules for all ages and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations to come: I cannot find any other method the Spirit has uſed, or does continue, to guide the ages ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the Apoſtles into all truth; but what is contained in theſe three parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. (1.) By thoſe Scriptures which he inſpired the Apoſtles to publiſh and deliver. (2.) By inclining the hearts of ſome men to continue that Miniſtry, which muſt endure to the end of the world. And (3.) By confirming thoſe truths contained in the Scriptures, unto the minds of men, by co-operating with the external miniſtration, by an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal work upon the underſtanding, will, and affections of thoſe who are incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in the day of his power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> then, The Spirit of truth guides us into all truth, by thoſe Scriptures Chriſt and his Apoſtles delivered to be the ſtanding rules for poſterity; Theſe are thoſe lively Characters, in which we may read the Nature of God, and the directions of our lives; Theſe are ſuch an infallible rule of truth, that they certainly guide thoſe into it, who ſoberly and conſcientiouſly apprehend
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:100880:150"/>
and follow them: They convey peace of conſcience here, which is a thing, valuable above Crowns and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; and hereafter give us ſuch poſſeſſions, as infinitely tranſcend the power of our thoughts, and exceed all humane expectations. Theſe Holy Scriptures contain ſuch a compleat bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Doctrine, that they need not any additions to be made to them; Let their own ſenſe be but ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, and if they are permitted to ſpeak their own mind, they will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther want <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> nor Traditions, nor any new Revelation neither, to render them a compleat Syſtem of Divinity; Mens own Doctrines, and not Chriſts, want Traditions to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them, and 'tis the pride and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs of a Sect of men, that would make all Chriſtians groan with their burden, and void Gods Word with their own pretenſions (however they are varniſhed with the plauſible Epithets of ancient and Apoſtolical, that make ſuch additions to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures). But the Holy Scriptures, which were, at firſt, given by inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, are able, of themſelves, when rightly underſtood, to make the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:100880:151"/>
man of God perfect: And, if they are able to furniſh the Miniſter; certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they are ſufficient to inſtruct the people: Nay, to make them through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniſhed to all good works, and are able to make them wiſe unto ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on through faith which is in Jeſus; (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15, 16, 17.). Hence is it that theſe are ſo far from being taken from the adult, that they are to be expoſed to Childrens Learning; Or elſe, it would not have been <hi>Timothy</hi>'s commendation, <hi>that, from a child, he had known the Scriptures</hi>; And if ſuch Elogiums were made in the honour of the Old Teſtament, much more praiſes muſt be given to the New, which ſhews us a way to be juſtified <hi>from thoſe things, from which we could not be juſtified by the Law of Moſes (Acts</hi> 13.39.); and <hi>brings life and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality to light</hi> (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10.). The Doctrines, in the Goſpel, preached by Chriſt, and enlarged upon by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, through the powerful inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Spirit, are ſufficient, accompanied with thoſe means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for their delivery, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary aſſiſtances given to thoſe that attend them with humility, to guide
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:100880:151"/>
men into all thoſe truths requiſite to be known in relation to their eternal welfare. And, therefore, <hi>bleſſed are they,</hi> (ſayes our Saviour) <hi>that hear the word of God and keep it (Luke</hi> 11.28.). From hence draw we the water of life; and theſe are the freſh ſprings of ſalvation, at which mankind may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie themſelves. Here have we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to demean our ſelves in all our various conditions in the World, that we may endure both the Sun-ſhine and the Storms: that proſperity may neither ſwell, nor adverſity conſume us: S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s advice, therefore, to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> muſt be attended by us alſo; <hi>To continue in the things which we have learned, and have been aſſured of, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of whom we have learned them</hi>; and that, <hi>becauſe evil men and ſeducers ſhall wax worſe and worſe, deceiving, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceived</hi> (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.13, 14.). Let the infallible men of myſtical, and unintelligible, demonſtration, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to prove what they cannot defend, but by their old argument of force and fire; Let them blaſpheme the Holy Ghoſt in the Apoſtles, whilſt, yet, they pretend to its inſpiration themſelves; Let thoſe argue againſt
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:100880:152"/>
the Scriptures being a Rule, when rightly underſtood, that can defend their Doctrine, only by a counterfeit tradition; Having no greater argument againſt the ſufficiency of the Scripture but becauſe it conſumes their Hay and Stubble; And that they can there neither fetch Wood to burn us, nor Stones to deſtroy us: But, let us, who are of the day, be ſober, and be wiſe to that which is good: And, then, as God formerly ſubjected Sathan to the ſeed of the Woman, for that by the Serpent he deceived their ſimplicity, and ſtain'd their innocence; ſo, though now he endeavours by ſubtile impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors to beguile ſoft and ignorant minds; he ſhall not alwayes triumph in his villany; But <hi>the God of peace ſhall bruiſe him under our feet ſhortly (Rom.</hi> 16.20.) The Providence of God is a great deep; the reaſon of man is not able to fathom it; And, though he may, for the puniſhment of our ſins, the tryal of our vertue, or to make our adverſaries ripe for deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, permit ſome to erect their Plumes, and lead captive unwary ſouls in triumph; yet, though <hi>he that ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth muſt take heed leſt he fall,</hi> let us,

according to S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s advice, <hi>hold faſt the form of ſound words</hi> (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.); and <hi>contend earneſtly for that faith which was once delivered unto the Saints (Jude, ver.</hi> 3.); and <hi>withdraw from every brother that walketh diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, and not after what has been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered</hi> (2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.6.); And, <hi>if we walk according to this rule, peace ſhall be upon us, and mercy (Gal.</hi> 6.16.): We need not then be afraid of the winds and ſtorms, nor yet of him that kills the body, if we truly fear him that can deſtroy the ſoul; Which none but God himſelf can do: <hi>For</hi> (ſayes our Saviour), <hi>whoſoever heareth theſe ſayings of mine, and doth them, is like a wiſe man who built his houſe upon a rock</hi>; and though the rain deſcend, the floods come, and the winds blow, and beat upon that houſe, it falls not (<hi>Matth.</hi> 7.24.). The God of truth, having now given us a ſtanding rule by the glorious inſpiration of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, expects that it ſhould be the general meaſure of our actions: And, as no ſign would be given of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours death and reſurrection, beſides that of the Prophet <hi>Jonas</hi>; ſo no rule can be expected by us, beſides the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:100880:153" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Goſpel, to the univerſal period and general Conflagration: Hence is it that S. <hi>Paul</hi> puts all under the ſevereſt curſe, that pervert this, or preach another Goſpel; And he does not only anathematize men, but paſſes the ſame ſentence upon Angels, if at any time they ſhould prove ſo bold and impious; Nay, he doubles the curſe, to teſtifie his faith, and proclaim the irrepealable du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Goſpel: <hi>But though we, or an Angel from heaven preach any other Goſpel unto you, let him be accurſed, (Gal.</hi> 1.8.). What was indited by the inſpiration of the Spirit, is certainly true, and we may confide in it; What is added by the wit of men, may poſſibly be falſe; and therefore it is not to be be looked upon as infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, any farther than it can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, either directly, or by conſequence, from the Scriptures themſelves. This is the rule which the ancient Fathers diſputed againſt the Hereticks by; and this muſt be the meaſure and rule of our faith, it being ſo full and plain, that no new Article muſt be added to our Creed; nor any other rules of duty contradictory to theſe; all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary things being ſo eaſie, that
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:100880:153"/>
any perſon of any ordinary capacity, uſing the methods of Gods own inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, may ſoon arrive at knowledge enough to ſave him, if his will does not rebell againſt his underſtanding, and he faithfully practiſes what he knows: Nor could the end of Gods Law ever be obtained, or men be left inexcuſable, if it were ſo obſcure, that it could not unriddle it ſelf. For the end of all Laws, being the obedience of thoſe that are bound by them: How can men obey that, which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, by any means, underſtand? And, if it cannot (by the ordinary helps of the learned in it) interpret it ſelf, there muſt, then, be a new inſpiration to interpret what was inſpired before: And then there will be two inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, where one would have ſerved: Becauſe he that can interpret a Law plainly to the World, might have made it plain at its firſt delivery: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, perchance, we may think it wiſer to do any thing with toil and pains, which may be performed with eaſe and pleaſure: 'Tis true indeed, that many men by ignorance or wilfulneſs, when they forſake the Guides of Gods appointment, heaping Teachers to
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:100880:154"/>
themſelves, having itching ears, may be, and are, led into divers errors, under the ſpecious pretence of truth. And thus thoſe amongſt the <hi>Galatians,</hi> who in thoſe early dayes troubled the Church, <hi>perverted the Goſpel of Chriſt, (Gal.</hi> 1.7.): But this is no argument againſt the ſufficiency or plainneſs of the Scripture, in things neceſſary to our eternal ſalvation: For they are, uſually, more obſcure Texts, that are to exerciſe the more Learned and Critical part of men, upon which He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies are founded; And this, too frequently is occaſioned by men that wrack and torture their underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, to conceive ſuch things as are not here perfectly to be known; Or, if they are to be fathomed by other men, yet are above the reach of thoſe, who thus ignorantly and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneouſly apprehend them: Thus S. <hi>Peter</hi> (ſpeaking of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles) ſayes, <hi>that in them there are ſome things hard to be underſtood, which they that are unlearned and unſtable wreſt</hi> (as they do alſo the other Scriptures) <hi>unto their own deſtruction,</hi> (2 Pet. 3.16.). But another ſort there are too, that have too much ſubtilty to be accounted
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:100880:154"/>
ignorant; Who are ſome of he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe diſputers of the world, that firſt ſuit their Tenets to their intereſt, and, then, violently preſs the Scriptures to prove what they were never intended for: We ſhould never, elſe, have heard, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> brought to prove that abſurd Doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation: Nor <hi>Feed my Sheep,</hi> to prove the Popes Supremacy: Nor <hi>He will guide you into all truth,</hi> to prove his Infallibility: Nor, <hi>He ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, yet ſo as by fire,</hi> to prove a Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: When all theſe Texts are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of fairer and more plain interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to another, and more cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, ſenſe; But that the ambition of ſome men would entitle themſelves to the government of the reſt; And then frame others belief to render them tame for ſuch a tyranny, and to be ſubject to whatſoever they will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, when all this while they ſuit the Articles of the Churches Faith, to the encreaſe of their own Wealth, the better to ſupport their Pride and Uſurpation. Nay, on the other ſide, we have thoſe amongſt our ſelves, who call the Pope names, and yet embrace his Doctrine; And tie that
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:100880:155"/>
infallibility, which they rob the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Chair of, to their own ſingle and Enthuſiaſtick determinations; Who, by miſunderſtanding ſome Texts of Scripture, direct themſelves by a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate impulſe, and then muſter theſe to defend it: But the Flower is not the leſs fragrant, for that the <hi>Spider</hi> thence will ſuck for poiſon; Nor does the Scripture ceaſe to be a ſafe, and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Rule to thoſe, who ſoberly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and follow it; Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome may wreſt and miſapply it: Nor does the Spirit, at any time, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict it ſelf: He having, therefore, inſpired ſome men to commit a Rule to writing for future Generations, to read and underſtand, and put forth a Law that is ſufficiently plain and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous; And men having reaſon and underſtanding enough, aſſiſted by the Spirits ordinary directions to guide themſelves by the meaſures of this Rule and Law into all truth: He expects, now, that they ſhould order themſelves as they do by all human Laws; That is; to believe upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Impoſer; and live pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to ſo great a favour; and labour to underſtand what he has
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:100880:155" rendition="simple:additions"/>
put into their power to know: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering that of wiſe <hi>Agur; Add thou not unto Gods words, leſt he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar,</hi> (Prov. 30.6.). The authority, God has given to the Governors of his Church, empowers them to command or alter circumſtantials, <hi>that all things may be done decently and in order:</hi> In theſe we are to <hi>obey them that have the rule over us,</hi> and to ſubmit our ſelves, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17.): But no men are authorized to uſurp the Throne of God himſelf; To create new Articles of Faith; Or impoſe other primary rules of duty, than what they find written in the Scriptures; They are only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, and explain, them: For, as we muſt not think of men, ſo neither of Doctrines, above what is written: Our language and deſign, muſt be the ſame with S. <hi>Paul; To deliver that which we alſo received,</hi> (1 Cor. 15.3.); <hi>So may we be workers together with God</hi>; And when the world in the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God (that is; by the works of God, which demonſtrate his wiſdom) knows not God; it may pleaſe him, <hi>by the fooliſhneſs of preaching,</hi> (i. e. what ſome men account folly) <hi>to ſave
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:100880:156"/>
them that believe,</hi> (1 Cor. 1.21.). And this leads me to the next particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in which the Holy Spirit of God guides us, that are remote from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Age, into all truth which they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: By inclining the minds of ſome men, to continue that Miniſtry that muſt have its ſucceſſion unto the end of the World: And this is the ſecond way of the Spirits conduct.</p>
               <p>That in all Religious Conſtitutions, which have been in the World, there has been a ſeparate, and appointed, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, is more notorious than to ſpend words in the proof of it; 'Tis too deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly planted in the minds of men, and it bears an equal date with the Law of Nature fix'd in us: Without this, publick Worſhip cannot have its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and orderly Being; And had not this been eſtabliſhed with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Chriſtianity, it would not only have been in a worſe condition, than any Religion which has poſſeſſed the world; But, than any Trade, or Occupation among us, to the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which, men muſt be learners, before they become able Workmen; Or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are permitted to exerciſe their particular Callings amongſt any
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:100880:156"/>
well ordered, and embodied, Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>The ſeparation, therefore, of ſome men from the generality of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans was firſt made by our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; When he called the Apoſtles, and ſent forth the ſeventy Diſciples to preach the Goſpel unto human crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And, when the time of his departure from the world was come; When he was to be received into his Fathers Kingdom, in ſuch a triumph as became a Conquerour, and one to whom all power was given; He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers his full Commiſſion to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; ſubſtituting them, in his own ſtead, to rule his Church, and to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain their Succeſſors; That, like the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> they might be legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and by a continued and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable deſcent, they might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuated to the end of the World. <hi>As my Father ſent me</hi> (ſayes Chriſt) <hi>ſo ſend I you,</hi> (John 20.21.). Or, as S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> deſcribes it; <hi>All power is given to me both in Heaven and in Earth; Go ye, therefore, and teach all Nations, Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt; Teaching them to obſerve all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:100880:157" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I have commanded you: And lo! I am with you alway (to wit</hi>; in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of this power, by your ſelves, and Succeſſors,) <hi>to the end of the world,</hi> (Matth. 28.18, 19, 20.). Theſe are ſome of thoſe gifts our Saviour gave unto men, when he aſcended upon high, (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.8.) <hi>For, he gave ſome Apoſtles; and ſome Prophets; and ſome Evangeliſts; and ſome Paſtors, and Teachers: For the perfecting of the Saints; for the work of the Miniſtry; for the edifying of the body of Chriſt:</hi> This is to endure, 'till we all come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Unity of the Body of Chriſt, to encreaſe our knowledge in the Chriſtian Doctrine, and prevent our being deceived, and led into error. Hence was <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Office, which he had received by the Ordination of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſtiled <hi>a gift,</hi> (2 Tim. 1.6.): And leſt theſe appointments ſhould not be accounted the products, and deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, of the Holy Spirit; Theſe gifts are attributed to the Spirit; Who is in himſelf one uniform Being, though theſe were divers, according to the variety of times and ſeaſons; <hi>And they are all ſuch manifeſtations of the Spirit, as are given to men to profit
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:100880:157"/>
withal,</hi> (1 Cor. 12.) Now as Gods Providence Rules the World, though we can neither diſcover his Councels, nor are able to account for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his operation; As he diſpoſes of Crowns and Kingdoms, determines our dayes, and diſpoſes our Habitations; though theſe things are accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by an order and train of ſecond Cauſes, ſeverally deſigning, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring to the end; So does the Holy Spirit diſpoſe the way of the Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome, and incline their minds to the Office of Miniſters in the Church of Chriſt, that Gods people may not periſh for want of knowledge; But there may be ſome alwayes to preach the Word, and to convey Chriſts Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine from Generation to Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: That his Church being built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the true confeſſion of an Holy Faith, as on a firm and well fixed Rock, <hi>the gates of Hell may never be able to prevail againſt it</hi> (Matth. 16.16. and 18.). Now a ſufficient number of ſuch men, diſtinguiſhed by their Education, and manner of living, from thoſe that are more encompaſſed with the noiſe and diſturbing affairs of this life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prepared by a previous train of
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:100880:158"/>
circumſtances, and having the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of their own parts and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings; And being by ſuch means able to ſee into the notions of thoſe that have gone before them, having been uſed more to reading, conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and retirement, than other men, and to weigh the juſt conſequences of things; They muſt needs attain a competent ability in the matters of Religion, to which they moſt apply themſelves; And they may be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, through the aſſiſtance of that Spirit, who calls and gives them Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in their Office, to become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in his hands, to guide men into the wayes of truth. In all the Arts and Myſteries of the World, we deem it a natural way to learn, by obtaining one, that is skilful himſelf, to teach us the Principles and Grounds of his Knowledge; And, we more certainly, and eaſily, obtain our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign when we have ſuch a one to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us: So is it in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; 'Tis a natural way to inform our ſelves in thoſe things that concern our Salvation, when we have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an an inſpired Rule; But men Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the knowledge of thoſe things
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:100880:158"/>
that prepare them for the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Myſteries of Religion, and are afterwards appointed by due Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and the direction of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>to guide us into all truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eſpecially (if in the laſt place) we conſider that the Spirit of truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms thoſe truths, contained in the Scriptures, unto the minds of men, by co-operating with the external ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Miniſtrations, by an internal work upon the underſtanding and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. That there is ſuch a thing as a Divine illumination yet continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt Chriſtians, as our Church owns it by her Prayers; ſo no man can reaſonably contradict it: Not that it does render any man infallible, as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> affirm; Nor inſpire men with any new Doctrine or Rules of life, beſides what it has revealed in the Scriptures; as ſome Enthuſiaſts adventure to determine: Yet, we muſt not, to avoid the extreams, forſake ſo uſeful an Article of belief, that gives God the glory of his power, and keeps us dependent upon him, and is ſo great a foundation of our prayers and praiſes. Truth is not to be forſaken by the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Samaritans</hi>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:100880:159"/>
may be of the ſame opinion; Nor ſhall I (like the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Barbary</hi>) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to eat of that Meat which is dreſs'd by one of a different perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Or to drink in the ſame Cup with a <hi>Moor,</hi> when he is a perſon of a wholſome Conſtitution, until it has undergone the Ceremony of Waſhing: Truth, in this World, will be blended with error; and 'tis the prudence, as well as piety of a Chriſtian, to make a ſeparation of the Wheat from the Chaff, and not to ſlight and refuſe the one, becauſe the other has been mix'd with it. 'Tis true indeed (as Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> expreſſes it). The Promiſe of the Spirit to the Apoſtles, which ſhould <hi>lead them into all truth,</hi> was made good unto them by private and ſecret informing their underſtandings with high and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Myſteries, which never entered into the conceit of man: And, to us this promiſe is made good, becauſe what was written by Revelation in their hearts, for our inſtruction, they have written in their Books: But yet this is not all the aſſiſtance the Spirit gives us: For, though he does not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire us with any new Doctrine; you
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:100880:159"/>
he opens our underſtandings to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the old: I am far from admitting the conceit of an impulſe to be the rule and meaſure of our lives; becauſe we know what miſchiefs have overſpread the World, when propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been vailed with ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and it may be our own as well as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s obſervation; <hi>Tanto ſunt ad ſeditionem faciliores, quanto ſibi vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentur ſpiritu excellere: Men are the more prone to ſedition, by how much the more they ſeem to excell in their inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>; yet there cannot appear the ſame danger, where the Spirit only aſſiſts our underſtandings to apprehend thoſe truths which are already deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, and inclines our wills and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to embrace them; when ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the direction of S. <hi>John,</hi> we are not ſo credulous, as to believe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Spirit; but to <hi>try the Spirits, whether they are of God or no,</hi> (1 <hi>John</hi> 4.1.). Now, then only may we reaſonably conclude, our underſtandings to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by the Spirit, when our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions agree with the written Word; For, <hi>to the Law, and to the Teſtimony,</hi> (ſayes the Prophet); <hi>if they ſpeak not according to this word, it is becauſe
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:100880:160"/>
there is no</hi> morning, or <hi>light, in them (Iſa.</hi> 8.20.). There are divers means natural in themſelves, and rationally appointed by Almighty God, for the informing men in the truths that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them; Reading, meditation, and hearing the Word, are proper methods to inform our underſtandings, and to guide us into the way of truth; But prayer is, therefore, wont to be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added, not only to compoſe our minds, and make them fit for Divine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, by a ſequeſtration of our thoughts from thoſe external objects, that by intermixing themſelves with thoſe that are more ſpiritual, confound our Idea's and notices of things, and render our minds more looſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant; But becauſe Prayer ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates thoſe aids and aſſiſtances of the Spirit, that facilitate our apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of truth; by removing objects that crumble and diſorder them; and it renders our notions more clear and durable. We uſe the means that are within our power, and ſet our reaſon and faculties on work; and then the Spirit, by a ſecret operation, enlarges our minds, and bleſſes our endeavours. Thus <hi>Paul muſt plant, and Apollo water,</hi>
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:100880:160" rendition="simple:additions"/>
although <hi>it is God that gives the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.). And thus the Lord opened the heart of <hi>Lydia</hi> to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Goſpel, whilſt ſhe attended to it, as it was ſpoken by S. <hi>Paul; (Acts</hi> 16.14.). When the Apoſtles were yet diffident concerning the truth of our Saviours reſurrection, though they had the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and the <hi>Pſalms</hi> by them, in which theſe things were ſufficiently predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; yet Chriſt himſelf opened their underſtandings, before they could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the meaning of thoſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, (<hi>Luke</hi> 24.45.) As we may <hi>do all things through Chriſt ſtrengthning us, (Phil.</hi> 4.13.); So, ſeparated from him, <hi>we can do nothing, (John</hi> 15.5.). The Spirit of God has put much of our duty into our own power; yet has ſtill reſerved ſomething to himſelf; that we may be kept humble, depend upon him, and beg his aid: For the animal man, that is not poſſeſſed with the Divine benediction and influence of the Spirit, (who admits not of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions prov'd only by Miracles) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, becauſe they appear fooliſhneſs unto him; neither can he know them,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:100880:161"/>
whilſt he remains in that condition, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned, are proved by Miracles, not Logick, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14.): Hence is it, that S. <hi>Jude</hi> deſcribes <hi>ſenſual men,</hi> to be ſuch as have not the <hi>Spirit, (ver.</hi> 19. of his Epiſtle): Now, upon the view of all this; As we have no reaſon, by our unbelief, to deprive our ſelves of what is promiſed, and to ſhut out thoſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances from our ſouls, which bleſs and facilitate our endeavours; ſo we have no cauſe to ſay, that our ſafety is beyond our power, and that Heaven is too high for our reach; ſince if we ſolemnly prepare our hearts, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly petition the aſſiſtances of the Spirit, we may obtain it, and God will not be wanting to us, if we are not, firſt, wanting to our ſelves. This is what S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſayes, <hi>Facienti quod in ſe eſt, Deus non deneg at gratiam; That God does not deny his grace to him who does what is in his power:</hi> And that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of our Saviour, may relieve and encourage us; That <hi>our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him, (Luke</hi> 11.13.) Let us act then with the dependence of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and yet not relinquiſh the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:100880:161"/>
of men: Let us not think to be drawn into an underſtanding and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of thoſe truths contained in the Scripture by the ſtrength of a Miracle, and upon the wheels of an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Providence; to be ſnatched out of the pit of ignorance by an irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble force, and informed by an Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical illumination: But, let us uſe thoſe means that are now put into our own power, for the full apprehenſion of all divine and neceſſary truth, and walk according to what we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy attained the knowledge of; that our obedience, according to what we have received, may atteſt the ſincerity of our minds: And then, if any thing yet remains, which is neceſſary farther for us to know, God will uſe ſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod or other to inform us; and, by his Spirit, diſpoſe our underſtandings to receive it; For God ſhall reveal even this unto us; and we have S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s word for it (<hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15, 16.). And thus I have now, at length, conſidered this promiſe of <hi>leading men into truth,</hi> both as it concerned the Apoſtles, and as it alſo relates unto our ſelves: I have ſhewed how it guided them; and how it does ſtill lead us into
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:100880:162"/>
Truth. There is now but one thing more that will want only a brief re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, before I arrive at ſome pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Inferences from the whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; and that is the latitude of this Promiſe, in relation to its object; which, as it hath been already diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed on with reference to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; ſo muſt it be explained in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our ſelves: For this univerſal, <hi>all truth,</hi> muſt not be underſtood in the utmoſt extent it is capable of, no more than it was with reference to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; but it muſt be limited, in theſe following particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>Spirit guides us into all truth,</hi> which may be neceſſary for the ordering our converſations in this World, ſuitable to the Religion, we are baptized into. There are directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons publiſhed in Sacred Writ for our Chriſtian deportment in all our vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtates and conditions: From whence S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the general, exhorts, <hi>that our converſation be as it becometh the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Chriſt</hi> (Phil. 1.27.). Which would be a ſtrange and inſufficient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, were there not in it a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat rule for our lives: The duties of a Chriſtian are, either concerning
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:100880:162"/>
God, others, or our ſelves: As to the firſt, we are commanded to <hi>worſhip God in ſpirit and in truth</hi>: The devotion we pay him muſt be ſuitable to his being, and the general rules given in the Goſpel (<hi>John</hi> 4.24.). And we muſt <hi>love the Lord our God with all our heart, and with all our ſoul, and with all our mind</hi> (Matth. 22.37.). As to the ſecond, we have this direction, To <hi>do to others as we would have them do unto us</hi> (Mat. 7.12.); And to <hi>love our neighbours as our ſelves</hi> (Matt. 22.39.): And as to our ſelves, we muſt <hi>walk honeſtly as in the day, not in rioting and drunkenneſs, not in chambering and wantonneſs, not in ſtrife and envying:</hi> (Rom. 13.13.). Nay, our whole duty is comprehended in one Text of S. <hi>Paul</hi>; who tells us, that the Goſpel teaches us, that, <hi>denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in the world</hi> (Tit. 2.12.): Piouſly towards God; Righteouſly towards our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; and ſoberly in relation to our ſelves. Nor have we only theſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral directions, but thoſe alſo that are ſo particular, that we may hence take the meaſure of our duties; and ſuch prudent advice is given in all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:100880:163"/>
that may happen to us: That we are neither left without proper counſel, nor yet without comfort and relief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Holy Spirit of Truth guides us into all thoſe Divine Truths which we ought to believe; and of theſe he has given us ſo exact an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that no new Article is to be added to that Faith, which has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready delivered to the Saints. The <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> in which are contained all things neceſſary to compleat our belief, is in every Article revealed in the Scripture; And men that go too far beyond it, are apt to be wiſe over much, and to think, and conclude, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond ſobriety: and therefore,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Spirit thus guides us <hi>into all truth</hi> that concerns our future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and ſalvation: It has informed us, that there is ſuch a ſtate, by <hi>bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life and immortality to light,</hi> in the Goſpel: and it has laid out and ſmooth'd the way that leads to it: It has given ſome deſcription of the ſtate it ſelf, as far as it was fit for us to know, or our frail capacities can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive: ſo that we may accommodate the words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> to the Holy
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:100880:163"/>
Spirit; <hi>Thou ſhalt guide us with thy counſel, and afterwards receive us to glory</hi> (Pſal. 73.24.): Theſe are the truths the Holy Ghoſt ſtill guides us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as far as our frailty is able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with his methods and influence: He does not now come amongſt men, to cauſe them to ſpeak divers Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages; or to work Miracles amongſt thoſe who have the Records of the Goſpel: Nor yet, to reveal ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, as the Father has put in his own power, and properly belong to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. He does not help us to ſearch into the Cloſets and Decrees of Heaven, no more than he diſcovers the Councels of Princes; nor does he elevate mens underſtandings, to diſtract themſelves with things that are above them; But, having given the Law of Life, he guides our feet into the way of peace.</p>

               <p>HAving thus far accompliſhed my deſign, in confuting mens falſe pretenſions to inſpiration from the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit of God, upon due examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others writings, and mine own thoughts raiſed for ought I know to the contrary, either by my conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with, or obſervations from, other men, (for I dare not call any thing mine own, ſo as to be any firſt inventor; Having no Common-Place-Book to direct me): Or elſe from ſome Superiour benediction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on human endeavours, which I have attempted in ſome part, to prove, and vindicate; And to ſhew, in this, all that I believe, or can, at this time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, in any meaſure unto others: That there may be ſome farther uſe made of this writing, I ſhall conclude all with a few brief Obſervations and Inferences from the whole, or ſome parts of this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:100880:164"/>And, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Every man ought to judge for himſelf in matters or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that are propoſed to his belief, or practice, as far as he has abilities, and capacity to underſtand. Becauſe S. <hi>John</hi> exhorts all men <hi>to try the Spirits whether they are of God:</hi> And this will neither ſeem to be abſurd, or impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, when we ſhall conſider, that we are men endued with rational facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; that we have the uſe of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, in which all things are plain, that are univerſally neceſſary to the Salvation of mankind; That we have Guides appointed to help us in the interpretation of what is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, and the Holy Spirit promiſed to aſſiſt us in all; Which God gives to every one who, in earneſt prayer, devoutly asks it; And which is preſent with him, in all emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, 'till, by a vicious life, he ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grieves him, and by an obſtinate continuance in the habits of ſin, he provokes it totally to withdraw from him. Were there an human Throne of infallibility erected, to which all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers might appeal, and reſt ſatisfied with the determinations of him that poſſeſſes it; There would be no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:100880:165"/>
of an Apoſtles direction to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>try the Spirits</hi>; But, ſince we are exhorted <hi>to prove all things, that we may hold faſt that which is good</hi>; And the Scriptures direct us to no ſuch human infallibility, but aſſure us <hi>that what is not of faith is ſin:</hi> As it produces the greateſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to every man to ſettle his own notions in Religion; So it is his duty to examine the Doctrines and Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, propounded to his belief, or which are deſigned to guide his practice before he believes and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains them; Making Gods Word his rule in all things that are plain and evident; And taking the aſſiſtance of thoſe Guides, and Teachers, which God has appointed and ſet over him, in thoſe points that are more difficult and obſcure: And this, if done with that humility, devout prayer for Gods aſſiſtance, and true induſtry which becomes a man in ſo great a concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as that of Religion, will either find out all truth; Or, if he remain in any error, it will be ſuch as God will never condemn him for; Since the moſt gracious God will never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from mankind, that their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of things ſhould exceed the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:100880:165"/>
of their reception, and what the means of his appointment cannot help them to: Nor that either their belief, or actions, ſhould ever exceed the power of their Beings: And thoſe that ſo ſtudiouſly and induſtriouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to give a check to mens rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning and examination about the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines they propound, render their opinions things to be very much ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; And will give us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that their deeds are evil, when they hate the light: And as for that peace among Chriſtians that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended infallibility in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any where elſe, boaſts an eſtabliſhment and continuance of; Whilſt Proteſtants are crumbled into Sects and Diviſions: We may eaſily reply, that they have their Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies as well as we; and parties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that oppoſe each other with an equal heat, and eagerneſs, in diſpute with other mortals, and are diſtinguiſhed by their ſeveral denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; Even as the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> difference themſelves from all, being ſuch ſworn Vaſſals to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they endeavour to ſupport it to the ruine of the Church; Let the <hi>Romaniſts</hi>
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:100880:166"/>
and others, therefore, firſt pull the Mote out of their own eyes, and then they may the better ſee to pull the Beam out of anothers. But why may not ſuch peace and order, as are conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, (and perhaps as much as can ever be obtained) be preſerved among men profeſſing Chriſtianity, by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Authority, checking the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly actions of men, without impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſetters on their belief? Which it is altogether impoſſible to compel, or puniſh either, if men were ſo wiſe as to keep it to themſelves, and not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble others by diſcourſe: I doubt not but it may be done, as well as Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity keeps men in a tolerable order, in relation to the management of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar affairs, though he that admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters it, is not infallible; Nor do all that are Subjects ſtill concur in Opinion with him. Preſerve, therefore, your judgement of diſcretion, and uſe it too, that you may not be led like blind men; when you have eyes to ſee, and helps to aſſiſt them when they wax dimm: And then having ſetled your ſelves in the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="323" facs="tcp:100880:166"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let me exhort you to ſtand faſt in it; Not to be, like waves of the <hi>Sea,</hi> rolling to and fro with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very tempeſt, <hi>and carried about with every wind of doctrine</hi>; Not to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with every new appearance in the world, becauſe variety, in other things different from Religion, is ſo grateful to the generality of men: For in ſuch things they may have their choice, and not be limited by a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour power: But our option, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Principles of Religion, muſt be directed by a ſuperiour rule and guide; And, having once found out this, we muſt not vary, upon new pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions, from what this preſcribes to us; Leſt, having left thoſe paths that ſhould direct us, we wander about we know not whither: Sathan gets great advantages upon unſteady minds: And 'tis eaſie to make a new impreſſion upon thoſe heads that are always ſoft, and therefore fit to receive any: Who have no notions of things fixed and ſetled, but the images and repreſentations, that are the Book in which they read all their Propoſitions, interfere with each other, and are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confuſed, or elſe are crumbled
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:100880:167"/>
and broken in pieces: Beſides, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of that nature, that if we play with it, as a thing indifferent, or change the true Principles for thoſe that are falſe; We either loſe it quite in the midſt of variety, or 'tis with great difficulty, if ever we recover it: This the Apoſtle plainly tells us, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4.). It is impoſſible, or (as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> there ſignifies) very difficult, <hi>for thoſe who were once enlightened, and have taſted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, and have taſted of the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come; If they ſhall fall away, to renew them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain unto repentance.</hi> Hence is it that our Saviour charges men <hi>to take heed what they hear,</hi> (Mar. 4.24.): And S. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts men <hi>to hold faſt the form of ſound words,</hi> (2 Tim. 1.13): And S. <hi>Jude</hi> urges, <hi>that we ſhould earneſtly contend for the faith, which was once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto the Saints,</hi> (third <hi>ver.</hi> of his <hi>Epiſtle</hi>). Let us, therefore, that are grounded in our Religion, behave our ſelves as men that are reſolved; And not by any means, be frightned from our Faith, by the ghaſtly looks, the bold threats, or the pretences, of
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:100880:167"/>
new Revelations from any: But, let thoſe Scriptures we have already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and our ſhorter Creeds drawn from them, be the ſtanding and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Rule of our Faith: For varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will diſturb us while we live, and almoſt diſtract us when we come to die; and, in all probability, deprive us of our future happineſs. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be ſenſible of the dreadful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of thoſe men that are ready to depart out of this, before they have prepared for another world; Who have all their guilts ſtanding round about them, and affrighting them with their gaſtly appearances, when they are toſs'd and tumbled upon a Bed of ſickneſs, when they can ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but death before them, and the diſmal proſpect of a blacker and worſe ſtate beyond it. And when, to all this miſerable and frightful ſcene of things, ſhall be added inward pangs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions of mind, doubled and height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned either by the falſhood or uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of thoſe Principles by which we direct our eyes in this view; How tragical and horrid muſt our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be? When our Spirits, that ſhould ſupport us under the infirmities of
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:100880:168"/>
our bodies are ſo wounded within us, that they are a torment to themſelves; and our own doubts and vexatious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties about thoſe Principles of Religion, that can only guide us through the Chambers of death, and let in the light from ſome glorious Regions beyond the grave, ſo increaſe upon us, that we are miſerably tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red betwixt hope and fear; when our ſetled belief of future things can only render our paſſage pleaſant, and our condition tolerable. Now, ſince a ſettlement of our Principles in matters of Religion, is of greater concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to us, than the ſettlement of our Eſtates; Becauſe theſe only ſerve to defray the charges of our Bodies, whilſt they ride Poſt through a ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtage, when thoſe prepare us for, and enter us into Heaven, and muſt maintain us through all the Ages of an endleſs Eternity: And ſince the Principles of Chriſtianity are the moſt excellent in themſelves, and have the beſt evidence of their Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, of any precepts of Religion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the World; And we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, in Sacred Writ, a method to find out what has been revealed from
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:100880:168"/>
Heaven; Let mens pretences be what they will, under whatſoever plauſible denomination, Who, that is rational, will not conclude it to be both his duty and his intereſt, if he has a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration for God, or a due reverence and regard to his own being, to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle himſelf upon the foundations of Chriſtianity, and upon theſe to build his belief and practice, till at laſt, through the merit of the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of men, he reaches Heaven? Not to pluck the <hi>Stars</hi> out of the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, but, by the will and favour of Almighty God, to aſcend above them, and enjoy an happineſs ſuitable to mans glorified capacity in thoſe bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Regions, that can neither admit of a decay or period; but ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue their ſtate, and to true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans their happineſs in them, through all the endleſs, unmeaſurable, ſpaces of a boundleſs and incomprehenſible Eternity. And now to conclude this exhortation with <hi>Arnobius</hi>'s Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and perſuading Rhetorick, at the latter end of his Firſt Book againſt the <hi>Gentiles</hi>: If men have gentle ſouls, capable of impreſſion, they cannot (under pretence of other rules)
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:100880:169"/>
offer any injury to Chriſt, nor reproach his Religion, but embrace both, if but upon this account only, that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to them proſperous things; Things to be wiſhed for, and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſired: Can any one refuſe to give honour and obedience to the Son of God, who was the Meſſenger of glad tidings, who vanquiſhed the ſhades and darkneſs of the grave, and brought life and immortality to light; Who alwayes preached ſuch Doctrines as cannot hurt the minds of any, but fill them with a more ſecure expectation? <hi>O ingratum &amp; impium ſeculum!</hi> as he goes on; O ungrateful and wicked Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration! If a Phyſician ſhould come to you out of a far Country, and ſhould promiſe you ſuch an univerſal Medicine, that would infallibly cure you of all diſeaſes; would you not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently run after him, pay all the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of Courtſhip and Honour, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him with all kindneſs and hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality? Would ye not wiſh his Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines to be infallible, by the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which you are promiſed free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from thoſe miſeries that attend your bodies even to the utmoſt peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od of your age? Nay, though the
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:100880:169"/>
thing were yet doubtful, would you not (being inflamed with the love of your own welfare) commit your ſelves to his conduct, and not obſtinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to drink even his unknown poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in hope of your own health and ſafety? <hi>Eluxit atque apparuit Chriſtus rei maximae nunciator,</hi> &amp;c. Chriſt, the proclaimer of great tidings, has now ſhined, and appeared in the World; What cruelty then, what barbarous inhumanity, what inſuperable pride is it with a ſupercilious diſdain, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn him who brings ſuch glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings unto men? Let us embrace therefore his joyful Meſſage, give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to that which affords ſuch hope, and pay all reverence and honour to him, who is the meſſenger of him that made us; Who came into the World, to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt; And to give to us eternal life; Men may (if they pleaſe) contradict the kind promiſes of our Saviour, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a future ſtate impoſſible; But 'tis more impoſſible for any man to prove his denial; Or, with any certainty, to convince himſelf, that there is no ſuch ſtate of men hereafter: Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt remain doubtful to thoſe
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:100880:170"/>
that will not believe the Goſpel, is it not more reaſonable to receive this Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſo well atteſted, and to renounce others that are not ſo, than to leave things of ſuch an infinite concernment at ſo miſerable an hazard? Nay, ſince there can be no other than probable proofs of future things, when Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are taken from their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without the admiſſion of Divine Revelation; Is there not greater rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon even when two things ſeem uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, to adhere to that which is more probable; And to that which gives us ſome hopes, rather than to that which affords us none at all? In this there can be no danger, to believe there is a future ſtate, there may be great in the denial of it; If it be not true, it makes us yet live with more comfort, and die with leſs trouble and reluctancy.</p>
               <p>But perhaps all may now be willing to believe the Scriptures to be true; Yet ſuch Faith, alone, will not gain the prize, though we finiſh our courſe in fighting for it; Therefore let mens belief of a future immortality, and a joyful ſtate, evidence it ſelf in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to obtain it: For that faith is
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:100880:170"/>
only fancy that thinks to be crowned without obedience; And to believe the Hiſtory of the Reſurrection of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and not raiſe our ſelves to new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life, will leave us ſtill dead in our ſins: <hi>Credere ſe in Chriſtum quomodo dicit</hi> (ſayes S. <hi>Cyprian de unitate Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae) qui non facit quod Chriſtus facere praecepit?</hi> How can he be ſaid to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, who does not do what he commands him? And a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the ſame Tract; <hi>Immortalitate potiri quomodo poſſumus, niſi ea, quibus mors expugnatur &amp; vincitur, Chriſti mandata ſervemus?</hi> How can we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy eternal life, unleſs we keep thoſe Commands of Chriſt, by which death is aſſaulted and overcome? S. <hi>John</hi> tells us, <hi>He that doth righteouſneſs, is righteous</hi>; And though men pretend other ſigns which are as eaſily confuted, as they are made; Yet, <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the Commandments,</hi> (ſayes our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.17.). And S. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> will vouch the application, if I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this to be the condition to obtain it, For though the Chriſtian Law be a Law of liberty, yet it is a Law ſtill, that commands us to act like Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:100880:171"/>
men, and not think to be drawn to Heaven upon the wheels of an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Providence, and craned up to Paradiſe by an irreſiſtable Power; We aſcend to Heaven by gradual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancements of virtue and devotion, nor can we think that all mankind are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually to be ſaved like the Thief, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Croſs: We muſt not think to mount above the Clouds, through the vapours of repeated Debaucheries, to rend the Skies, and make Heaven o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by louder Oaths, and thundering Execrations; Or to jump out of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilah</hi>'s lap into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſome. No, ſurely, <hi>they that have done good, ſhall go into life everlaſting; But they that have done evil, into everlaſting pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We learn from this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, to praiſe God for giving us the Goſpel, and to admire and extol the Holy Ghoſt himſelf, who in ſuch an eminent manner aſſiſted the Apoſtles to commit ſo excellent a ſyſteme of religion to writing, that we, of the latter ages of the World, may read, what we could not hear; And by the ordinary conduct of the Spirit of truth, be guided to the knowledge of thoſe things,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:100880:171"/>
which they were extraordinarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired to deliver. Not to commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſo great a favour, muſt be the higheſt ingratitude imaginable: Let us be as thankful then as we are know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and as we increaſe daily in the one, let the other run parallel in the enlargement. God is pleaſed to own himſelf glorified by our praiſes; This we do when we praiſe him with our tongues; But then does it become moſt glorious, when it is followed with an holy and Religious life: The former may proceed from hypocriſie; But attended with the latter, it makes the whole Trinity to rejoyce, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures to our ſelves thoſe Graces we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready have, and engages God to give us more, as our future conditions ſhall want ſupplies: <hi>To him that hath, ſhall be given</hi> (ſaies our Saviour): Nay, this in an eſpecial manner rejoyces the holy Spirit of God, whoſe proper work it is to ſanctifie; And a vicious life is ſaid <hi>to grieve him:</hi> And how ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable a Sacrifice the whole is, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in what he ſayes by the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> (Pſal. 50.23.): <hi>Whoſo offereth praiſe, glorifieth me; And to him that ordereth his converſation aright, will I ſhew the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:100880:172"/>
ſalvation of God.</hi> Praiſes and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings are the natural reſults of a ſenſe of mercies and favours impreſs'd upon the minds of men: And we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thoſe to be unworthy of a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, that will not acknowledge the goodneſs of their Benefactors; And the proportions of thanks, muſt take their meaſures from the benefits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; How much therefore the ſending the Holy Ghoſt to inſpire the Apoſtles, and by them to convey light unto the World, to conduct man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to glory and immortality, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all the temporal favours we do enjoy; By ſo much the more muſt our hearts be lifted up, and our lives ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our gratitude to him that ſent him, and to him who by his merit and interceſſion, procured him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Did the <hi>Spirit of truth,</hi> guide the Apoſtles into all truth neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the Salvation of men; And does he ſtill influence our minds, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote our endeavours, in making en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after the things that conduce to our peace? Then let us pray frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Almighty God, for this influence and benediction of the Spirit. Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was that which prevail'd with God
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:100880:172"/>
to ſend him in ſo eminent a manner, and for ſuch glorious deſigns into the World, and prayer will ſtill continue him here; <hi>I will pray the Father</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth,</hi> (Joh. 14.16.). Prayer has not only an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon our ſelves, as it fixes our minds, and makes our holy reſolutions ſteady, but mightily prevails with God himſelf, who will crown what he has commanded with ſucceſs; In this, therefore, lies our greateſt ſtrength, in the performance of which duty ſoberly, and with a ſuitable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and intention of mind, we may be ſaid <hi>to wreſtle with God</hi>; Nay it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys to us thoſe aſſiſtances of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that are uſeful to us for the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying our natures, and carrying us through the hazards and various cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of our lives; <hi>For if ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil</hi> (ſayes our Saviour) <hi>know how to give good gifts unto your children; how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the holy Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> (Luke 11.13.). Let us not then be wanting to our ſelves in this duty of Prayer, ſince ſo great an advantage at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:100880:173"/>
its devout and hearty perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance; and to publick Prayer, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God is moſt glorified, the pains are only preſence, and devotion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If God ſent his Spirit upon the Apoſtles, <hi>to guide them into all truth,</hi> that we might have ſafe and infallible Rules to order and direct our actions by; Then ſee how God values <hi>ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Faith,</hi> however men too much diſregard it: If either any Creed, or none at all, could have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried men to their future bliſs, Chriſt need never have come into the World, to deliver an univerſal Doctrine in the Goſpel; Nor ſent this Holy Spirit of truth, to guide the Apoſtles <hi>into all truth.</hi> This neceſſity, therefore, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ſound in the Faith,</hi> was the reaſon why our Saviour, and his Apoſtles, caution'd men againſt Prophetical pretenders, and falſe Teachers; <hi>to take heed what they hear,</hi> (Mark 4.24.). <hi>To have a care that the light which is in them be not darkneſs,</hi> (Luke 11.35.). <hi>And to take heed leſt there be in any of them an evil heart of unbelief, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from the living God,</hi> (Heb. 3.12.). Hence is it, becauſe (as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſayes) <hi>there are damnable Hereſies,</hi> that
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:100880:173"/>
the unſound <hi>Cretians</hi> were ſo ſeverely to be reproved, <hi>that they might be ſound in the Faith,</hi> (Tit. 1.13.). Hence is it that S. <hi>Paul</hi> commands <hi>Timothy, to hold faſt the form of ſound words,</hi> (2 Tim. 1.13.). Which probably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to ſome brief Creed, or ſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Chriſtian Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> delivered to him by the Apoſtle; Though we find them now Burleſqu'd, and flouted at<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But, alas! with as little wit as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. From hence finally was it that S. <hi>Jude</hi> exhorted thoſe, to whom he wrote his Epiſtle, <hi>to contend earneſtly for the Faith, which was once delivered unto the Saints,</hi> (3. <hi>ver.</hi> of his <hi>Epiſt.</hi>) We are not now to make our own Faith, nor is it indifferent what we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let us receive therefore what has been delivered out of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, through all the ſeveral A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Chriſtianity, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make our lives as pure as our Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> We may learn from this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit of truth, to ſpeak truth; and by no methods to impoſe upon one another; That we may evidence to God, our ſelves, and the world, that the Spirit of truth has ſtill an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:100880:174"/>
upon our minds. There are a generation of <hi>Vipers</hi> among men, <hi>whoſe teeth are Spears and Arrows, and their tongue a ſharp Sword</hi>; That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs the whole trade of lying, and yet pretend to be men inſpired; Theſe receive falſe News in groſs, and then retail it out to others; Their tongues indeed are very ſharp, and no wonder neither, ſince they keep the Whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone wholly to themſelves: Theſe are your itinerant Hiſtorians, that, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume our Corn, carry, alwayes, fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands at their tails; Who lie ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that they can hardly believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves when they ſpeak truth, and give to all, that have had the curſe of their converſation, a plain teſtimony who their Father is: But, let not any of our ſouls enter into their ſecrets; But reſolve to reſemble the <hi>Spirit of truth,</hi> in abominating all lies and hypocriſie, and to qualifie our ſelves for our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture aſcent to Gods holy Hill, <hi>by ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing the truth in our hearts,</hi> (Pſal. 15.) Our Saviour <hi>had no guile found in his mouth</hi>; And we muſt follow ſo good an example; unleſs we think lying the Character of a Saint, and perjury to put on a Martyrs Crown; S. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:100880:174"/>
did not think ſo, when he forbad the <hi>Coloſſians, to lie to one another, ſeeing they had put off the the old man with his deeds,</hi> (Coloſ. 3.9.). Let us therefore beware of Arrogance, and Calumny; Of detracting from others, or attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting too much to our ſelves; And let us imitate the Holy Spirit under the Goſpel, <hi>by guiding our ſelves into all truth</hi>; So ſhall we avoid both ſin and ſhame, and eternal confuſion at the great and terrible day of the Lord, that we may then give up our accounts with joy, and not with grief. Would we but endeavour to follow the ſacred Spirit of God, who is ſo ready to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence our minds, in truth, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, Commerce and Trade would be more innocent, we ſhould neither betray our own ſelves by any falſe, or glozing language, nor ſhould we ſuffer by plain dealing: Oaths would again become Religious among <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, nor would any be unjuſtly executed by <hi>guilty,</hi> or ſcandalouſly freed by an <hi>Ignoramus</hi>; Our gracious, and truly Great, Monarch would be ſafe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the baſe attempts of any to ſecure him; He would be our own, and we
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:100880:175"/>
at his wiſe, and lawful, diſpoſal, by his Coronation Oath, and our ſworn Allegiance to him: Every man, were there truth among us, might enjoy peace in his own capacity; he might ſit under his Vine and his Fig tree, and Liberty, and Property, would never be bones of contention more: But if we remain Hypocrites in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and falſe to each other, we can neither expect that God or men ſhould be our friends; Becauſe what in us lyes, we peck at the foundations of the World, and make the whole Creation groan; We ſhake the main Principle of Trade and Commerce, when we are ſuch wretched creatures, that no body can believe us; And, we cannot but enrage the Great God, who, being truth it ſelf, has ſent his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit unto us, <hi>to guide us into the wayes of truth:</hi> Whatever guilt, therefore, any perſon may, by the iniquity of times, ſtriking in with his own eaſie inclinations, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to himſelf in this point; <hi>Let him now repent while it is called to day, leſt the night come,</hi> in which
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:100880:175"/>
terror and aſtoniſhment will ſurprize him, whoſe obſcure ſhadows will, by degrees, withdraw the pleaſing light from him, till it lodges him in a ſtate of blackneſs for ever.</p>

               <head>The Concluſion.</head>
               <p>WE are here placed in a World ſo full of objects, that affect our external ſenſes, that we are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally led more by theſe, than we are by faith; And when by degrees we abſtract our thoughts, and fix our minds on things above, we either weary the powers of our minds, and make them ſink into a ſtupid inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, or elſe are ſo pleaſed with the ſprightlineſs of our creating fancies, that we nimbly make Idea's in our brains of ſuch ſeeming things, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were, nor ever ſhall be; And ſo we lead our ſelves into the belief of what was not deſigned to be the object of our underſtanding, no more than it ſhall be the ſubject of our poſſeſſion. Sometimes theſe things are projected before hand, by the cunning politick men of the World, who by ſuch means intend to impoſe upon others to carry
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:100880:176"/>
on ſecular intereſts, that may, in the end, be gainful to themſelves; And, ſometimes, men by reaſon of their weak and unable conſtitutions, acting contemplation beyond their own ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to manage it, impoſe upon themſelves, till they really believe their own thoughts of objects that yet have no real exiſtence, nor are ever like to have a being in the Univerſe. Some think too much, and others too little; Too much learning makes one ſort mad; and others are mad, becauſe they have ſo little. Some men by ſinking themſelves into a deep melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, and others by a nimble and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant agitation of their blood and ſpirits, command themſelves into ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie or phrenſie; And then their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions grow ſo big, that they become proportionably tall too, till they aſpire to the ſtorming the Walls of Heaven, attempting to blow open the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gates, that they may pry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe things which are lock'd up from the inquiries of men; And thus being puff'd and ſwelled up, it proves only to be Tympany and diſeaſe, when we think we have true conceptions, and when our own thoughts have
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:100880:177"/>
raiſed our fancies, we conclude, that the Spirit overſhadows us, and our obſcure opinions, or ſtrange propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, raiſed by the ſudden tranſports of our minds, are too often, with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence enough, boldly averred to be the immediate dictates of the Holy Ghoſt. Want of true and ingenuous education, and thereby the more exact aſſiſtances of reaſon, cauſes many of thoſe who would be accounted more ſpiritual than other men, to think themſelves inſpired from above, when an unuſual fear, a ſudden joy, or a powerful diſeaſe has brought Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions into their Nerves, and ſeiſed their reaſon and judgement with a Palſie, ſo that all their notions are jog'd into a confuſion, and their facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties can neither embrace or purſue their proper objects. But by what means ſoever the thoughts or expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſuch men are lifted to an height, waiting for an impulſe, ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and groaning for an unuſual influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Vain are thoſe hopes, where there is no promiſe, and uncertain that rule of determination of things which appears to be fallible and deceitful; And yet thus are all the expectations
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:100880:177"/>
of thoſe who think the Spirit guides them into truth by other means than what I have already ſhewed you, or to any rules and meaſures of religious actions, than what are plainly laid down in the Word of God, or thence drawn by a fair and truly Logical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction: If you ſhould be at the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to examine a little all the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded impulſes of men, their great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety will evince their folly, and their oppoſition to each other, their deceit and falſhood. Is there any Sect, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to Enthuſiaſm, that does not peremptorily, and with the greateſt confidence, aſſert the Spirits internal ſeal to their principles, although juſt oppoſite to each other, and all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps contrary to the Scripture? This is the great fountain, which yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides into ſo many ſtreams, whoſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters all have different taſtes according to the chanels in which they run, and the variety of ſoil through which they paſs: This is made the cauſe of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which in it ſelf is ſtill but one; This makes men divide from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all from that Church to which they ſhould belong; proving each others Doctrines erroneous, and
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:100880:178"/>
all ſtill by the ſame Spirit: As if the God of order delighted in diviſion; and different Religions, like variety of creatures, proclaimed Gods Wiſdom and his Power; When he has now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd one faith to the whole World, and ſent his Son to ſet up his Banner for all Nations to flock to it. Divers Languages indeed were once a chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of inſpiration from the Holy Ghoſt, but different Creeds were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet the fruits of him, that is but one. That truth which the Spirit guides men into, can be no other than the plain uniform rules of the Goſpel; and whoever pretends to any inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to deliver a Doctrine different from this, blaſphemes the Holy Ghoſt, and makes God a lyar, whilſt he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends his inward ſeal publickly to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt an open falſhood.</p>
               <p>But if there were ſuch a thing as the Spirits impulſe in theſe ages of Chriſtianity, we ſhould have ſome certain characters, by which we might know it, as the Prophets and Apoſtles muſt be ſuppos'd to have had; and, if we make it an argument to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince others, we muſt work Miracles to atteſt its original: The latter none
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:100880:178"/>
of the Enthuſiaſts pretend to; Or when ever their madneſs has attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted this teſtimony, no ſooner do they dubb themſelves by the names of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, but they are diſcovered to be plain Cheats: If they pretend a way to evidence to themſelves that they are inſpired with a divine breath, to give them a warrant for doctrine or action not conſonant to the Writings of the Apoſtles; it does not only ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Scriptures inſufficient, but makes God to contradict himſelf, and wounds that Eternal Truth of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity into which we ultimately reſolve our belief: But let us come to the examination of the impulſe it ſelf, and we ſhall perceive in the midſt of what uncertainties ſuch men muſt be miſerably toſs'd, who ſuppoſe what they deem ſuch to be ſufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for what they then think on and propoſe to themſelves: What ſtrange and impious actions have been the conſequences of ſuch ſuppoſals, I need not now relate, becauſe they have made ſuch noiſe and ruines among our ſelves, that they are ſtill freſh among us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:100880:179"/>But to proceed with this ſuppoſed impulſe or impreſſion upon mens minds, by which, deſerting the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, ſome Enthuſiaſtical men will take the meaſures of their doctrines, or actions: I know not what they mean by it, unleſs it be the height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our perſwaſion, making our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a thing bold and ſtrong, and our reſolutions to act and maintain it, fix'd and zealous; And if this be what they make a rule, or a character of the Spirits guidance, ſince we find but little difference, when we view this ſuppoſed operation in perſons of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, nay, oppoſite principles, we muſt either conclude what all deliver under this pretence to be true, or elſe it is not ſafe to conduct any: The former is too wild a poſition for any that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſobriety, to eſpouſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the latter muſt be true: Beſides, every mans reaſon may ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him, that our perſwaſions, and determinations of things, become as well ſetled and fix'd, and have their various elevations or depreſſions, as well by the ſtrength or weakneſs of arguments, duly weighed and attended to, as by any impulſe which can be
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:100880:179"/>
imagined: How then ſhall we be able to know what our reaſon dictates, and what we are confirmed in by ſtrength of argument, from what the Holy Spirit now ſeals by an impulſe, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon our minds? How ſhall we diſtinguiſh betwixt a ſtrong fancy, a ſetled opinion, and this pretended inſpired Doctrine? Nay, how can we difference (without recurring to the eternal Laws of good and evil, which will render this new impulſe uſeleſs) the impreſſions of the Spirit, from a ſecret temptation, and a ſubtile ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion from him who is our greateſt adverſary?</p>
               <p>If we dare adventure to be ſo Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, as to pretend to new diſcoveries, and ſuch a rare ability to diſtinguiſh betwixt the motions which theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral impulſes make: Since there can be but one ſort of action in the ſpirits of a man, (if the perception be not above reaſon miraculous) the ſame convulſions and percuſſions on the Nerves, to cauſe the ſoul to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and believe, whether it be a truth or falſhood, that is repreſented; a truth from God, or a diabolical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion; How can the rareſt and moſt
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:100880:180"/>
artificial Enthuſiaſt diſtinguiſh betwixt actions where there is no difference at all? For as it matters not, whether the object propoſed to the Wills em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracement, be either real or apparent good, the ſame paſſion is uſed in the reception; ſo in reſpect of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding alſo, If the object ſeems to be true, it makes the ſame impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with truth it ſelf. If we pretend a difference in the Images repreſented in the brain, which the ſoul, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating, does according to their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or deformity, own or reject the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects repreſented by them; ſince we find ſtill that an error preſented under the notion of truth, as long as we receive it, is as pleaſant to us as truth it ſelf, there can be no ſuch Idea's ſuppoſed, of ſuch different aſpects, that in them we can read good and evil, without ſome more ſuperiour direction: For, if there were, it would be impoſſible for a man to be deceived, that gave himſelf time to contemplate theſe Images: But if we ſhall, (as we muſt indeed), prove the truth of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits impulſe, from the agreement of the thing it impells us to with the truths revealed in Gods Word; then
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:100880:180"/>
the impulſe it ſelf is but a weak di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, that muſt have another more convincing to determine it: Nay, not the ſureſt confirmation of things, that admits a proof beyond it ſelf, whilſt the Scripture becomes its Judge, either to condemn or acquit it. If this were not ſo, why ſhould our Saviour give the World ſuch admonitions, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion men againſt <hi>falſe Chriſts,</hi> and <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> that ſhould ariſe and deceive many, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 24.), but that he foreſaw the falſe pretenſions that would be made to inſpiration? S. <hi>John</hi> need not otherwiſe have cautioned us not to <hi>believe every Spirit,</hi> nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted us to <hi>try the Spirits, whether they are of God</hi>; but that he knew that <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny falſe Prophets were gone out into the world.</hi> But,</p>
               <p>(<hi>Laſtly</hi>) Let us conſider too, that God does not uſe to make bare his arm, and put his power to an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate work, when the thing may be accompliſh'd as well by other means, which he has appointed to that very end: For, though this might demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate his Power, yet, it leſſens his Wiſdom, to exert more ſtrength, and uſe more applications to produce an
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:100880:181"/>
effect, which fewer might as well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh; Nay, it would ſubvert that ſcheme of cauſes which his contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance has, already, ordered; It would both render Gods rules, and mans en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours after the knowledge of the truth, uſeleſs and ridiculous: At leaſt, thoſe Scriptures which are already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, would not be able to <hi>make the man of God perfect</hi>; which is not only contrary to the Apoſtles affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.17.): But S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s argument muſt be inverted; and he might juſtly: he <hi>aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> becauſe it would not be <hi>the power of God unto ſalvation</hi>; whereas he plainly and confidently affirms it to be ſo, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16.). Why ſhould any therefore; now the Rule is given, vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expect revelations and impulſes, and extend their belief to a bold pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, deluding themſelves with vain hopes? ſince theſe now are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promiſed nor in that manner, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts wait for them, ever intended. Let us reſt ſatisfied, therefore, with thoſe truths already received, ſince no more Divine Rules of life, can ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally be expected, till the Day of Doom: And, with Gods benediction,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:100880:181"/>
and the ordinary concurrences of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit upon the Goſpel, let us frame our lives according to its Precepts and Commands; that walking according to theſe Rules, we may at laſt <hi>receive the end of our faith, the ſalvation of our ſouls.</hi> Theſe the Holy Ghoſt has ſealed to us, not only by inſpiring the Sacred Pen-men to an exact delivery; but he has confirm'd them alſo by ſuch Miracles, as at once exceed the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the creation, and ſurmount the objections of men and Devils. Upon this we build a rational belief, though ſome myſteries in our Religion exceed our full and perfect comprehenſion: Other pretenſions, however back'd with great names, being confidently averr'd with boldneſs and zeal, are no other than wild notions, and, exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant fancies; Things, that if Satan, who pants and breathes for our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ruine, can once perſwade us to an embracement of; he then preſents a deformed Monſter for the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Truth. He has then caſt a veil upon our minds, and leads us blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold into what errors he pleaſes: He ſpreads his Nets and entanglements for us, and certain he is to catch and
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:100880:182"/>
enſnare us: For who cannot lead the blind into a ditch? or bring him upon a Precipice, when he thinks himſelf ſafe and ſecure? How eaſie is it for the fallen Spirit, that envies men the very hopes of bliſs, ſince he himſelf is in eternal deſpair, to dart into perſons, who forſake the written Word, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend new impulſes and revelations, thoſe poiſoned arrows, that ſhall drink up their ſpirits, and perſwade ſuch to embrace any thing, who have no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rule, than their own perſwaſions? Liſten not then to the fond fancies of any bold and paſſionate men, who, making uſe of their hot conſtitutions, convert their own natural raſhneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſeeming zeal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pouring forth thick words, and thin ſenſe, whilſt they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently pretend the Spirits impulſe for all their rude and unreaſonable no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and give the ſtamp of Canon to their Doctrines: Nor muſt we yet, on the other hand, ſo far make our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Judge, as to deſtroy our faith; but taking the Goſpel for our ſufficient rule, let us uſe our faculties to explain and apprehend it: But by no means let us curtail or extend it, beyond what was the deſign of the impoſer.

'Tis a ſtrange Age in which we live, when Religion is almoſt loſt, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king too ſtrict an enquiry after it, and too much curioſity in our ſpeculations, has rendered us almoſt regardleſs of our practice; We diſcourſe the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt and moſt ſerious points of our holy faith, with ſo much levity and diſreſpect, the indecency of the places in which we hold ſuch Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, adding to our vanity, that we firſt make our Religion common, and then ſlight it as mean and inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: But whatever the Sons of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs do, let us who are of the Day, be ſober, and with due reverence and a godly fear, receive thoſe impreſſions of the Spirit, which he has made in Sacred Writ; ſo ſhall we avoid the blaſphemies of thoſe, who ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently aſſert Diabolical ſuggeſtions, and the black fancies, which are the fruits of a corrupted conſtitution for Divine inſpirations. For no zeal or mode of delivery, can poſſibly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade any rational man, that duly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes his own faculties, that profound nonſenſe, or unaccountable propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are deep Divinity: Nor that men whoſe natures are envious and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:100880:183"/>
can poſſibly receive inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from God, to promote diviſion, raiſe diſturbances, or to continue any, which have already had their auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious beginnings, and, as I hope, their full progreſs among us. For, <hi>that wiſdom which is from above, is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, and eaſie to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated; full of mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and good fruits, without wrangling, and without hypocriſie: And the fruit of righteouſneſs is ſown in peace for them that make peace.</hi> Thus I have endeavoured to free the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations of the Holy Spirit, from the bold claims of <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> when they plead its conduct, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate it to themſelves, in thoſe falſe Doctrines which they publiſh to the World.</p>
               <p>What now remains to finiſh this Diſcourſe, but only to beg, that we would be perſwaded to avoid theſe obſtructions to the compleatment and perfection of our Religion; and to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe the contrary that may perfect our obedience to the truth; that we would give unto God an undivided heart: that we would not halt betwixt two opinions, and mix Chriſtianity with other principles different from
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:100880:183"/>
it. That we would not think the Croſs ſo grievous to be born, when the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of a Crown is propoſed with it. That we would not be ſo fond of our natural diſpoſitions, but ſubmit our inclinations to Gods commands; that we would more ſeriouſly endeavour to make our faith conquer our ſenſes, in things that are not their proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; that the ſpirituality of that Worſhip which the Goſpel preſcribed, may be more ſtrictly practiſed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by us. That we would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to alleviate the burden of thoſe duties, that Chriſtianity preſcribes, by the rational conſiderations of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and rewards. That we would allow our ſelves more leiſure for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and thoughtfulneſs, by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement from the hurries and buſineſs of the World; that we would baniſh the love of the World from our hearts, eſpecially when detracting from the love of God, and the intereſt of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That we would diſtinguiſh well betwixt zeal and paſſion, and let good things determine our affections. That we would not wilfully miſunderſtand the Goſpel, to ſupport either a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple or a faction. That we would
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:100880:184"/>
watch againſt the inſinuations and ſubtilties of the Devil, who <hi>like a roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Lyon, walks about, ſeeking to devour us.</hi> That we would beware of pride and obſtinacy of mind, which hates conviction, and ſtrengthens error. That we would not be partial in the choice of the duties of Religion, ſince the ſame authority enjoins all, and true obedience muſt be univerſal. That we would baniſh coolneſs, and not be indifferent in our choice of Religion, but be ſtrict in the examination of our principles; that in the proof <hi>of all things, we may hold faſt that which is good.</hi> Finally, That we would not imbibe ſuch Opinions, as in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or conſequences, are deſtructive of Chriſtianity, that we may not ruine by particular concluſions, what we ſeem to hold to, and profeſs in the general. And (Laſtly), That we would admit ſuch evidences of what Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity enjoins us to believe, as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the things are capable of, ſince the expectation of more is unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and a farther demand is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt the Laws of diſcourſe; and we require what is impoſſible to be done. This advice, if we cordial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:100880:184"/>
embrace, will prepare us for obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the truth, and hinder us from being ſhaken with every wind of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and toſs'd alwayes in the midſt of uncertainties; our judgements then will be fixed and ſetled; and if we add our ſincere endeavours to live accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the principles we receive, and pray to God to aſſiſt us in our duties, we ſhall gain peace of conſcience here, and hereafter an eternal Crown of Glory: <hi>Which God of his infinite mercy grant to us all, for Chriſt Jeſus ſake, to whom with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, be aſcribed by all rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that are capable of performing it, all Glory and Adoration now and for ever.</hi> Amen.</p>
