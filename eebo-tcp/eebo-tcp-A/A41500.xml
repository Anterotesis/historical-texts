         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

hath of late been made ſo manifeſt
to all the Houſhold of Faith in the Nation, that my
confidence is great, that it ſhall not proceed any
further to enſnare and pollute any of the Sons
and Daughters of God, by joyning in the offering
up of ſuch ſtrange fire unto him. And though there
be ſome, who, having formerly caſt it off as a menſtruous rag of Popiſh

yet God (I truſt) will ſuddenly ſtop and heal this unclean iſſue
in the body of his People, and ſo curſe the root of this bitterneſs,
that it ſhall not bring forth much fruit, nor many be defiled with it.
Yea, though a ſecond Repentance in ſuch caſes, be not a fruit that
groweth very plentifully on the Tree of fleſh and blood, yet am I not
without all hope but that through the grace and mercy of God, ſome
of thoſe may awaken, and recover themſelves out of this Snare of
<hi>Satan,</hi> whoſe foot hath been taken, and is (at preſent) held in it.
I confeſs the World hath of late given a furious on-ſet and charge

thing (almoſt) after the manner of Saints, and as becometh the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,

               <p>That Authority of Teaching; wherewith the Teachers we ſpeak of
are inveſted, by that kind of Biſhop which preſumes to give it, is a
meer nullity and lye. The Goſpel knows no Biſhop of ſuch a chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
or complexion, as are appropriately theirs, who claim and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
a power as of obtruding upon Chriſt and his Churches, on the one
hand, what perſons they pleaſe in the name of Miniſters, or Teachers,
(only if they be deſirous to accept of this ſacred inveſtiture from their
hand;) ſo on the other hand, to keep back ſuch from their Service,
whom both the one and the other, moſt deſire in this relation, only
becauſe God hath not given them Darkneſs for a Viſion, or ſent them
this <hi>ſtrong deluſion,</hi> confidently to imagine, that they ſee Prelates, or
<hi>Dioceſan</hi> Biſhops, walking like Angels in the plains of the Goſpel, and
Chriſt giving them power to preſcribe in his Church what forms of
Worſhip, be they never ſo uncouth, and what Ceremonies, be they
never ſo apiſh, they pleaſe. Beſides many other Writings, both for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
and more lately publiſhed, which demonſtrate the Generation
of ſuch Biſhops to be Aliens and Strangers to the Laws and Statutes of
the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael, The Un-Biſhopping of</hi> Timothy <hi>and</hi>
Titus, <hi>with the Angel of the Church of</hi> Epheſus (a Book firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled

Enlargements, by the Learned Gentleman, <hi>William Prynne</hi> Eſq;)
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100311:3"/>
clearly vindicates the Goſpel from all complyance with them, and
ſends them to ſeek their pedigree and original, where they will be
aſhamed to find it. And (doubtleſs) the conteſt about Prelatical U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpations
had been comprimiſed long before this, and the Churches
of <hi>Chriſt</hi> diſcharged of ſuch unſupportable burdens, were not all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
againſt carnal Intereſts, like gapings againſt an Oven, and the
Truth, though <hi>Speaking with the tongues of Men and Angels,</hi> a Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
unto thoſe, whoſe Judgements and Conſciences are under an arreſt
by the pomp and grandure, either in <hi>Spe,</hi> or <hi>in Re,</hi> of this preſent
world: For to reaſon Un-bewitched, it cannot (lightly) but appear an
incredibility of the firſt Magnitude, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould appoint ſuch an
High Officer in his Church, as the <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> and eſpecially the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan</hi>
Biſhop beareth himſelf with an importune and high hand to
be; and yet neither give them any name whereby to be known or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
from others, nor yet aſſign them any work or Service at
all, in, or for the Church. When <hi>Chriſt</hi> ASCENDED on High, and
gave gifts unto men, <hi>he gave ſome</hi> Apoſtles; <hi>and ſome</hi> Prophets; <hi>and
ſome</hi> Evangeliſts; <hi>and ſome</hi> Paſtors and Teachers: but we hear of
none given, either Lord Biſhops, Dioceſans, or Metropolitans.
When he DESCENDED into Hell [or, into the lower parts of the
Earth] themſelves will not plead, that he brought them up from
thence. Therefore (without controverſie) they are no plants of <hi>Chriſts</hi>
planting; neither is there any thing in the Church for them to do:
For the whole work that concerns the ſpiritual welfare of the Church
from firſt to laſt, is committed to the Church-Officers lately named
by the Apoſtle, as being every way ſufficient for the effectual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of it. This the Context ſpeaks plainly enough, and without
a Parable: <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles,—and ſome Paſtors and Teachers;
For the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of the body of Chriſt; till we all come in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Faith, and
of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure
of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt; That we henceforth be no more
Children toſſed to and fro,</hi> &amp;c. Epheſ. 4. 11, 12, 13, 14. So that there is
no empty or void ſpace in the ſpiritual Concernments of the Church,
for our <hi>Dioceſan</hi> biſhops to thruſt in with their importune and offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
interpoſure; <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors and Teachers;</hi>
have the whole heritage of this work divided amongſt them by the
Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf. Or if there be any thing left for our Lord Biſhops
to do by way of ſervice to the Church, it is to teach them, as <hi>Gideon</hi>
taught the men of <hi>Succoth,</hi> with thorns and Bryars, to perfect them
through ſufferings, and ſo to prepare them for their glory: this ſervice
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100311:4"/>
(I confeſs) they do them with great diligence, and very effectually.
Nevertheleſs, <hi>Chriſt</hi> never ſet them up in his Church, to do either
this or any other ſervice unto it: only he permitted them, whilſt the
Church ſlept, to convey themſelves ſlily into it: And becauſe the
teaching of the members hereof by Afflictions, is a neceſſary work,
and moſt proper to be done by the vileſt and moſt unworthy of men,
therefore (I conceive) he hath judged it meet to afford an opportunity
to this Generation of men, to be the Actors in chief in it. But now
that kind of Biſhop we ſpeak of, being no Goſpel Creature, nor any
wayes derived or deſcended from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it is a clear caſe that he
hath no right of authority or power from him (and from any other
he cannot have it) to exerciſe any Eccleſiaſtical function at all, much
leſſe to create, or make any Goſpel Miniſter. It is a true rule, <hi>Non
Entis nullae ſunt affectiones, nulla eſt efficacia;</hi> That which is not, hath
not wherewith to act, or operate. So that as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to
the Criple, <hi>Silver and Gold have I none; but ſuch as I have give I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee.</hi> (Acts 3. 6.) Our <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Biſhops may on the contrary ſay
unto thoſe that come unto them for Authority and Power to preach

               <p>To afford our preſence and attention unto men preaching by <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal</hi>
Authority, is to ſtrengthen the <hi>Hierarchical</hi> Intereſt, to credit
and countenance the horrid Uſurpations of the Prelatical Order, in,
and over the Churches of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and conſequently, to involve our
ſelves in the guilt of all thoſe out-rages of oppreſſion and cruelty,
whereby they daily waſte and wear out the Saints of God amongſt
them; and ſo to render our ſelves juſtly liable to partake with them
in their plagues, when God ſhall bring the day of their vengeance
upon them. To own thoſe for our Miniſters and Teachers, who
are ſent forth by them to teach (and own them for ſuch we do, if we
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100311:4"/>
frequently, or ordinarily, hear them) is to own thoſe who ſend them,
and to ſet to our ſeal, and give them teſtimony, that they are intruſted,
and inveſted by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> with that authority and power, in the name
(or by the pretence rather) of which they ſo ſend them. For what
can we (lightly) do to commend them unto the world upon higher
terms, then by ſuch our approbation of them? Or were we deſirous,
as far as lyeth in us, to make the mountain of their preſent power
ſo ſtrong that it ſhould never be moved, by what other means
more probable, or promiſing, could we endeavour, or attempt it?
For who, though but in face a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> will not fear to have a hand
in the rooting out, yea, or in oppoſing, ſuch men, or ſuch an order of
men, amongſt them, who have this teſtimony from ſerious and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſed
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath entruſted them with the
care, and power of providing meet and worthy Miniſters for all his
Churches round about them? <hi>Verily, Verily, I ſay unto you,</hi> (ſaith
Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 13. 20.) <hi>If I ſend any,</hi> (So our former Tranſlation, and
ſo the Original) <hi>he that receiveth him, receiveth me; and he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
me, receiveth him that ſent me.</hi> He is ſaid to receive a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
or meſſenger, ſent by Chriſt, who heareth him, (as appeareth by
the parallel place, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 16.) that is, who heareth him, as, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
ſent by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> or, who heareth his Doctrine with reverence
and ſubmiſſion, and ſo as to own it. Now the <hi>receiving</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> [in
his Meſſengers, or, in their Doctrine] is ſuch an act which tendeth
highly to the honour of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to the confirmation and enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his intereſt in the world, and is mentioned under ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
as this, in the words now cited: Therefore upon the

not a little towards the eſtabliſhment of them in the poſſeſſion of that
exorbitant and monſtrous power, by which they tyrannize over the
conſciences and comforts of thoſe, that are loyal and faithful unto
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and ſo (as hath been ſaid) becomes acceſſary to all the
ſufferings of the Saints, by means of that power, in thoſe mens hands.

               <p>The hearing of men ſent by the Biſhops, being (as was now ſhewed)
a receiving of theſe Biſhops themſelves (in the ſence declared) muſt
needs be a walking uncharitably towards them, and a means to keep

their foot faſt in that ſnare of death, wherein it is at preſent taken, and
to put far from them the happy day of repentance from their unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
uſurpations (together with many other high miſdemeanours ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying
theſe) whereby they might be ſaved. For when they ſhall
ſee the ſervants of God (eſpecially the more knowing, and better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed

by ſupplying theſe from time to time with men of worth, who are
able to ſpeak unto them words, by which they hope they may, or ſhall
be ſaved? Men that receive ſo large a teſtimony of the uſefulneſs
of their callings, and goodneſs of their practiſes and walkings in them,
from perſons ſo conſiderable as thoſe mentioned, are not like to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
or ſuſpect, any ſuch evil in either, for which they need any open,
or ſolemn repentance. So that for the ſervants of God to honour,
with their attendance, the Miniſtry of men preaching by Epiſcopal
authority, is (in reality of conſtruction) a flattering of the Biſhops
themſelves; and (doutleſs) what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks <hi>(Prov.</hi> 26. 28.)
of <hi>a flattering mouth,</hi> as viz. that it <hi>worketh ruine,</hi> is altogether as true
of <hi>flattering</hi> actions, by which men may be flattered into ruine, as
well as by words of like import. Now though the Biſhops we ſpeak
of be guilty of the blood of many thouſands of precious ſouls, for whom
<hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed, partly by thruſting out of the Vineyard of <hi>Chriſt</hi> many
true and faithful labourers, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf had ſent in thither;
partly by keeping out many others of like worthy character, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
any entrance, but onely by the polluted door of their Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by which very few, or none, qualified aright for the Miniſtry,
can obtain leave of their conſciences to enter; but chiefly by ſetting
over them, or obtruding upon them, ignorant, ſcandalous, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
perſons, for ſpiritual Guides, beſides many other exemplary
miſdemeanors, and unworthy practiſes, in their own lives and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations?
although (I ſay) our Biſhops (ſo called) do by theſe means,
without the leaſt regret, or remorſe of conſcience, bring upon their
heads the blood of many thouſand precious ſouls, yet will not this
juſtifie, or excuſe the children of God, if they ſhall act any thing,
which is like to further the perdition of their ſouls, the ſalvation
whereof, (the enormous wickedneſs of the men notwithſtanding)
they ſtand bound, both by the Law of charity, and in conſcience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, not to hinder (as by encouraging, or hardening them in
any evil way) but to promote with the beſt of their underſtanding.

our power, is (without controverſie) a duty lying upon all men:
how much more upon all Saints? That our Lord Biſhops are deep in
the condemnation of reſiſting the Truth; and this much after the
ſame manner, wherein thoſe <hi>Egyptian</hi> Sorcerers reſiſted <hi>Moſes</hi> (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by promoting a counterfeit and falſe worſhip and ſervice of God,
like unto the true: as thoſe Sorcerers deluded <hi>Pharoah</hi> and the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi>

[or difficult queſtion] amongſt true and knowing Chriſtians.
Again, that a detection or diſcovery of the folly or madneſs of thoſe,
who either thus, or in any other way, reſiſt the truth (for the Scripture
ſuppoſeth a deſigned reſiſtance of the Truth to be madneſs, or folly
in her exaltation, in whomſoever it be found, 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 16. 2 Tim.</hi>

in their hoſtile devices and attempts againſt the Truth, it is (certainly)
a duty incumbent upon them to uſe ſuch abſtinence. That this abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence

by that diſcovery, which <hi>Davids</hi> abſence once and again from

that folly, or madneſs, in their great Lords and Maſters (the Biſhops)
which being diſcovered, will render them the general abhorring of men,
and ſo cauſe them to fall like Lightning from the Heaven of their Glory

The particulars, by one, or more of which, the ſaid Miniſters are wont
to make the hearts of perſons truly godly, heavy and ſad, are theſe (with
their fellows) 1. They are expreſly enjoyned by their Patent to ſhew
their child like (that I ſay, not blind) obedience to their Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
(the Biſhops) by ſaying over their Creed, and their <hi>Pater-Noſter,</hi>
over, and over, and over, once (at leaſt) every month, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the reſt of the devices comprehended under the Title of

appearing alſo in their Maſters Livery [I mean, the Surplice]
that all men may know to whom they belong, and whoſe Servants they
are. This is one great nuyſance done by theſe men to the ſpirits of
thoſe who truly fear God. 2. They bow down their necks to the
yoak of Ceremonies, and yeeld that obſervance to the fopperies of
men, which is due to the moſt weighty precepts of God. 3. There
are few of them, who content themſelves with the ſimple obſervation
of theſe Ceremonies, but think it their duty to take pitty on them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo generally hated, oppoſed, and condemned, and to ſpeak a good
word for them now and then, and to juſtifie both the practice and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition

wiſdom, or both, to ſteal an Opportunity (ſometimes) to ſpeak ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably

is there of them, but, be he never ſo conciſe and ſhort in his Prayer
before his Sermom, yet alloweth a large roomth for the mention of his
Reverend, if not Right Reverend Fathers in God; (as if they ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
that God would not know that they meant them, unleſs they
preſented them in their <hi>Pontificalibus</hi> before him) yea, and giveth
flattering and unbeſeeming Titles to other great perſons alſo? 6. They
are the ſmalleſt number of them, who will not <hi>ſemel in anno</hi> (at leaſt)
teach (in effect) the importune Doctrine of <hi>blind Obedience</hi> to Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours,
both Eccleſiaſtical and Civil: It is like, they will not teach
this Obedience under the term of, <hi>blind,</hi> becauſe Proteſtant Writers
have made it infamous amongſt perſons of this profeſſion, by oft charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Doctrine of <hi>BLIND Obedience, as Antichriſtian,</hi> upon the
<hi>Jeſuites.</hi> But when they fall upon hammering this nayl (I mean of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and ſubjection to Superiours) they ſo ſorge it, as that they leave
no liberty or freedom of judgment, or conſcience, to inferiours, to
judge of the lawfulneſs, and unlawfulneſs of the Superiours command;
but conclude thoſe amongſt tranſgreſſors, and perſons worthy ſevere
puniſhment, that refuſe to conform themſelves to their injunctions,
though their judgments and conſciences conclude them never ſo (mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly)
unlawful. And what is this, but (in effect) to preach and preſs
the ungodly, yea, unmanly doctrine of <hi>blind Obedience?</hi> Yea, ſome of
them do not forbear to place the Perfection, or higheſt ſtrain of that
Mortification and ſelf-denyal, which they preach, in that kind of blind
Obedience to Superiours, which hath been mentioned. 7. They are
not a few of thoſe that are of beſt eſteem in the ſaid party of Miniſters,
who will not find, or take occaſion (ſometimes) to vent themſelves in
unworthy and baſe reflections upon the Power of Godlineſs, and upon
perſons more tenderly conſcientious than themſelves, and who ſtrain
at the <hi>Camels,</hi> which they ſwallow. 8. (and laſtly,) There is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one of a thouſand of them, that (according to their duty) will <hi>cry
aloud, and lift up their Voice like a Trumpet, to ſhew</hi> their great Lords
and Maſters <hi>their</hi> great <hi>tranſgreſſions,</hi> in perſecuting the Servants of

obtruding upon them dumb Doggs (or worſe than dumb) or greedy
Wolves, in their ſtead; in exaſperating the ſpirits of Rulers againſt
them, and repreſenting them as perſons dangerous to the State, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100311:8"/>
troublers of its Peace; in aſſenting unto, if not procuring the making
of hard and cruel Laws againſt them, (with the like.) Theſe are
part of the unhappy wayes and practices, by which even our beſt
Preachers of the Epiſcopal Character, are alwayes apt, and often wont,
to make ſad the ſpirits of holy and good men, when they hear them:
ſo that though they may (poſſibly) hear ſeveral Sermons from them,
from none of which they ſhall actually ſuffer in any of theſe kinds;
yet they cannot at any time go to hear them with any reaſonable Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,

we encourage and rejoyce the heart, even of the refuſe and tail of
this Clergy alſo, theſe being fleſh of their fleſh, and bone of their

the loyns (or hands rather) of the ſame Ghoſtly Fathers, the Biſhops.

much more threatning, than promiſing, God being no wayes like to

the Prayers, by which the Miniſter to be ordained, is recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

by thoſe that are preſent, and aſſiſting in the buſineſs, being (upon the

(Prov. 15. 8.) we have but a quick-ſand for a foundation of any hope,
that Miniſters <hi>Prelaticall</hi> ordained, are ſent forth unto the great work

ſuppoſe we (for argument ſake) that our Lord Biſhops, and their
Chaplains (who are the great, if not the only doers, in the Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

ſomewhat more may be added before we conclude: and the queſtion
(if yet a queſtion it muſt be) hath been largely diſcuſſed, and learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

us, after it had lain ſick, and languiſhing, ready to have given up the
Ghoſt for many years together; it cannot be looked upon with a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually-diſcerning
eye, but (what is frequently obſerved in long and
waſting ſickneſſes) a lightning before death: and as the ſetting up of
<hi>Dagon</hi> the ſecond time in his place, after he had once fallen upon his

               <p>As far the greater number of the good People of God in this Nation
ſtand now perſwaded in their Judgments and Conſciences, touching
the hearing of Miniſters ordained by a power ill-affected to <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt</hi> and his Intereſt on Earth, it is juſt matter of ſcandal and offence
to the weaker ſort of this people, and of ſorrow and ſadneſs of heart
to many of them that are more ſpiritual, and knowing, to underſtand,
or hear, that any of their <hi>Chriſtian Brethren,</hi> formerly united unto
them in the ſame mind and judgment againſt all the Superſtitious and
<hi>Antichriſtian</hi> doings amongſt us, are (frequently) preſent in thoſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies,
unto whom men ſent unto them by the Prelates onely, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
notwithſtanding to ſpeak in the name of God, bearing themſelves
as the Embaſſadors of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> lawfully commiſſioned by him for the
Service they perform. Now the Scripture oft ſpeaks of ſcandalizing,
in one kind or other, thoſe that are weak in the Faith, as of a very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and Un-<hi>Chriſtian</hi> miſdemeanor in thoſe who are called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
and of a provoking reſentment with <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf: <hi>But if thy Brother
be grieved with thy meat</hi> [when as thy life and health may be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with ſuch meats otherwiſe, which will not offend, or grieve him]
<hi>now walkeſt thou not charitably. Deſtroy not him with thy meat</hi> [that is,
eat no ſuch meat, the eating whereof by thee, may very poſſibly through
the ſcandal given thereby, prove his deſtruction] <hi>for whom Chriſt dyed,</hi>
Rom. 14. 15. <hi>For meat deſtroy not the work of God. All things indeed
are pure, but it is evil for that man that eateth with offence. It is good
neither to eat fleſh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy Brother
ſtumbleth, or is offended, or made weak.</hi> Haſt thou faith? Have it to thy
ſelf before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himſelf [namely by
ſcandalizing a weak Brother] <hi>in that thing which he alloweth</hi> [as lawful
for him to do] Rom. 14. 20, 21, 22. <hi>For if any man ſee thee which
haſt knowledge, ſit at meat in the Idols Temple, ſhall not the Conſcience of
him that is weak, be emboldned to eat thoſe things that are offered to
Idols: and through thy knowledge ſhall the weak Brother periſh, for whom
Chriſt dyed. But when ye ſin ſo againſt the Brethren, and wound their
weak Conſcience, ye ſin againſt Chriſt,</hi> [grieving and indangering thoſe,
who believe in him, and therefore are dear unto him] 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 10, 11,
12. <hi>And whoſoever ſhall offend one of theſe little ones that believe in me,
it is better for him that a Milſtone were hanged about his neck, and he

were caſt into the Sea,</hi> Mark 9. 42. See alſo Matth. 18. 6. Luke 17.
1, 2. The clear reſult of theſe, and other-like ſayings of the Holy
Ghoſt, is, that to ſcandalize, offend, or grieve any weak Believer, yea
though it be but by an undue exerciſe of our lawful liberty (lawful, I
mean, otherwiſe,) is very unworthy the profeſſion of the Goſpel, and
an indignity offered unto <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſorely threatning him that ſhall
offer it, without repentance. It is true, where there is any obligation
upon men by way of precept, or duty, to do that, at which a weak
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> is offended, here is no ſcandal, or offence given, but onely
taken; and if any man be offended in this caſe, he muſt bear the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of his ignorance himſelf. God is to be obeyed, though the whole
world ſhould be offended at it. But that it ſhould be incumbent or
neceſſary, by any precept or command from God, to hear (at leaſt
ordinarily, and from day to day) Miniſters of a Lordly creation, or
Prelatical tincture, never yet (I ſuppoſe) came within the Verge of
any mans thoughts, unleſſe (haply) of ſome Epiſcopally addicted
above their fellows: nay, the practiſe hath not found (that I can find
or hear of,) any competent Defender of ſo much as the lawfulneſs of
it, to this day. Therefore if it ſhould be given (by way of Charity)
unto thoſe, that have made bold to take the liberty of hearing the
Miniſters we wot of, that this their practice, ſimply, and in it ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
is lawful; yet in the caſe of ſo much ſcandal and offence, as it
gives to many thouſands of their weak Brethren in the Nation, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
in them Un-<hi>Chriſtian</hi> and Unlawful; yea, and it is the more
Un-<hi>Chriſtian</hi> and unworthy, in as much as it further cauſeth much ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and grief of heart, even unto thoſe that are of more underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
becauſe, beſides the ſcandal given by it unto the weak, they judge
it a practice altogether, and in it ſelf, unwarrantable, as being deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
unto the Royalities of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as Sole King, and Law-giver

and when they have ſatisfied themſelves, and well underſtood <hi>the

1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 5. Whereunto the Apoſtle immediately ſubjoyns; <hi>We are
of God; he that knoweth God, heareth us;</hi> [that is, reliſheth our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,
and with diligence and delight, attendeth on it] <hi>he that is not

whoſe Miniſtry carnal Profeſſors and looſe Chriſtians, ordinarily and
in great numbers are wont to gather themſelves, ſitting from time to
time with contentment and ſatisfaction under it, are not Teachers
of that kind, or of that ſpirit, with whoſe Miniſtry ſpiritual and ſound
Chriſtians can long reſt ſatisfied, or care to attend upon. Theſe are
thoſe <hi>Strangers,</hi> whom Chriſt ſaith <hi>his Sheep will not follow, but will
flee from them,</hi> becauſe <hi>they know not their voice, John</hi> 10. 5. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that he <hi>could not ſpeak
unto them, as unto Spiritual, but as unto carnal,</hi> becauſe they walked in
ſeveral <hi>carnal</hi> practices (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 1, 3.) So may we without any breach,
either of Charity or Truth, look upon thoſe <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as ſavouring the
things which be of men, more than the things which be of God, who
addict themſelves to ſuch a Miniſtry, which is conſtantly frequented,
countenanced, approved, applauded, and delighted in, by ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> who by their ignorance, prophaneſs, and all
manner of debauchery in their lives and converſations, blaſpheme
their holy Profeſſion, and ſtain the glory of the ever-bleſſed Goſpel
of God. And is not this the undeniable and appropriate character of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100311:13"/>
the Prelatical Miniſtry? Do not the dregs and refuſe of the Nation,
generally, and in all places, gather themſelves unto it, and rejoyce
over it, being as well apaied with it, as <hi>Micah</hi> was with his Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Prieſt made of a ſilly wandring <hi>Levite? Now know I</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>the Lord will do me good, ſeeing I have a Levite to my Prieſt,</hi> Judg.
17. 13. Yea, this Miniſtry ſeems to be, both intended by the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of it (the Prelates) and alſo form'd and managed by the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Clergy, who exerciſe it, for the gratification of ſuch perſons, and
this rather, by perſwading them that they are truly religious, and in
favour with God already, than by making them ſo indeed. Therefore
they who being (not in their own eyes only, but even in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of diſcerning and found Chriſtians) living members of the
houſhold of Faith, ſhall notwithſtanding reliſh and ſavour a Miniſtry
calculated for the World, and accepted by it accordingly; hereby
give teſtimony againſt themſelves, that as yet they retain too much of
the ſpirit of this World, to be fill'd, as they ought, with the Spirit of
God, and of the World which is to come.</p>

               <p>Neither may it be unworthy our conſideration in the caſe before us,
that we read in the Scriptures, that unbelievers and perſons deſtitute
of the ſaving knowledge of God, did ſometime come into the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Aſſemblies of the Saints, to partake of their Miniſtry, and were
herein blameleſs: 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 22, 23, 24, &amp;c.</hi> but do not any where
find that Believers were wont to fall into the Aſſemblies of Idolaters
or Unbelievers, to receive inſtruction amongſt them, or from their
Prieſts, in things appertaining unto God and his Worſhip. Yea,
the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> adjudgeth it a practice altogether inconſiſtent with
true Chriſtianity, to eat and drink with falſe worſhippers at their
Idolatrous feaſts, although it were done to eſcape perſecution, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
10. from ver. 13. to the end of ver. 23. And the ſacred Author of the
Epiſtle to the believing <hi>Hebrews,</hi> admoniſheth and exhorteth them,
thus; <hi>And let us conſider one another, to provoke unto love, and to good
works; Not forſaking the aſſembling of OUR SELVES together, as the
manner of ſome is, &amp;c. Heb.</hi> 10. 24, 25. He admoniſheth Believers
to aſſemble with Believers, and not to withdraw themſelves from
theſe, eſpecially not to joyn or mingle themſelves in the Aſſemblies
of Idolaters or Unbelievers, as ſome degenerating ſpirits amongſt
them (it ſeems) did, out of fear of ſuffering perſecution. For that
theſe Chriſtianiz'd <hi>Hebrews</hi> were in a ſore ſtorm of perſecution when
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100311:13"/>
this Epiſtle was written to them. and conſequently, when they were
charged <hi>not to forſake the aſſembling of themſelves together,</hi> is evident
from many paſſages in it: yea it is more generally conceived by the
beſt Expoſitors, that the principal intent and ſcope of the Epiſtle was
to ſupport and comfort the <hi>Hebrews</hi> under thieir great afflictions for
the Goſpel, and to encourage them unto conſtancy and perſeverance in
their profeſſion of it unto the end. So that feare of perſecution is no
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> ground for thoſe that deſire to approve themſelves faithful
unto <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the Goſpel, to turn <hi>Renegadoes</hi> from the holy
Aſſemblies of the Saints, in which, and over which, they formerly
rejoyced, and to run to the tumultuous and diſorderly conventions of
carnal and prophane perſons, as unto cities of refuge, hoping in theſe
dark thickets to find covert and ſhelter from thoſe ſtormes and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts,
which threaten thoſe, who know God better, and feare him
more, then to ſhrink from him for feare of men. And great reaſon
there is, why Saints, who have been nouriſhed with the ſincere milk
of the Ghoſpel, bred, and brought up (as <hi>Chriſtians)</hi> amongſt their
<hi>(Spiritual)</hi> Peers, in their Holy Aſſemblies, ſhould not dare to quit
theſe Schools of light and holineſs, to become proſelytes to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallowed
and rude Synagogues of a politique and worldly conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
becauſe they ſeldome, or never, change their quarters upon theſe
terms, but they doe it to their certain damage and great loſs in their
Spiritual eſtates, if not to the loſs of their immortal crowns, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the end. For when they have for any ſpace of time, been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced,
and ſeaſoned, by the Prelatical Miniſtry, which ſtill ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intends
theſe Congregations, experience ſheweth that they are <hi>chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
not <hi>from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> but from <hi>glory</hi>
to ſhame (I mean, from a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and humble frame and temper,
unto that which is worldly, ſowre and ſupercilious) as by the ſpirit
of the world, working effectually (for the moſt part) in the Children

boaſting of their knowledge, imputing it to the weakneſs and
ignorance of all others, that they do not ſacrifice at the ſame Altars
with them, or that they ſcruple, queſtion, or condemn any thing, which
they allow and practiſe. In a word, theſe Crow-trodden profeſſors,

ſo intoxicated alſo, beſotted, and bewitched with their new wine,
that they ſeldom, or never, recover that lovely image of God, wherein
they formerly appeared, to the comfort and joy of many a precious

good and deſirable end; as well a declining and forſaking of theſe
means, (whether out of diffidence of the ſufficiency of them for the
end deſired, or upon any other reaſon whatſoever) to eſpouſe others
that are more (carnally) flattering, and pretending to more ſtrength
and efficacy, but want the feal of Divine Approbation upon them; as
the aſſociating of means of this latter kind with thoſe of the former,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100311:16"/>
hoping by ſuch a Conjunction as this, to purſue our deſires with leſs
danger of a defeat, or diſappointment; I ſay, both the one and the
other of theſe projections and practices have ſtill been diſpleaſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, and of ſad conſequence unto thoſe, that have been no better
adviſed than to make tryal of them. Examples of the truth of this
obſervation the Scriptures afford many. When King <hi>Ahaz</hi> would
not reſt ſatisfied with the ſtrength of his own Kingdom, and men, by
whom God had promiſed him protection &amp; deliverance from the two
Kings his neighbours, who combined in War againſt him, but judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it better policy to call in the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> to his aſſiſtance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the mind of God made known unto him by the Prophet, in
theſe words, <hi>Take heed, and BE QUIET</hi> [that is, trouble not thy
ſelf in ſeeking after forreign help, from one place or other: It is
much the ſame expreſſion, and upon a like occaſion, which we find,
<hi>Iſa. 30. 7. Their ſtrength,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>is to ſit ſtill;</hi> meaning to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend

ſtrange Princes for their aid] <hi>Fear not, neither be faint-hearted, for the
two tails of theſe ſmoaking fire-brands, &amp;c.</hi> This King (I ſay) by this
prudential courſe (as he ſuppoſed) for the preſervation of himſelf
and his Kingdom, provoked the juſt ſeverity of God to the great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery

28. <hi>verſ.</hi> 16, 19, 20. For brevity ſake, and partly becauſe of the affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
with the ſubject matter of the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Conſideration</hi> preceding, hath
with the Argument of this in hand, and partly becauſe the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
aſſerted for Truths both in the one, and the other, are ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs of God, as the Great Judge of
all the Earth, we ſhall forbear to argue any more Texts of Scripture
upon the ſervice of what hath been laid down as the ſtrength of our
preſent <hi>Conſideration,</hi> although there be very many more, which both
in face and in heart, carry the ſubſtance and effect hereof, as (by
name) <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 6, 7, 8. -30. 1, 2, 3, 15, 17. 2 <hi>Chron. 25. 6, 7, 8. Jer.</hi>
2. 36, 37. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 26, 27, 28. (with ſeveral others) I ſhall onely
inſtance the caſe of thoſe <hi>Judaizing Chriſtians</hi> in the times of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
who to make all ſure (as they thought) for their Juſtification
before God, would needs joyn the righteouſneſs or works of the Law,
and more eſpecially Circumciſion, with the belief of the Goſpel, or
Faith in Chriſt for the obtaining of it. But through a carnal diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the ſufficiency of that way and means, which God hath ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
for their juſtification, whilſt they went about to ſupply the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100311:17"/>
defect hereof with an additional means ſuggeſted by their own
wiſdom (or folly rather) unto them, they miſerably miſcarried in that
ſo important a deſign, meeting with condemnation, inſtead of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
from the hand of God; according to what the great Apoſtle
plainly declared unto ſome of them: <hi>Behold,</hi> 1-Paul <hi>ſay unto you, that
if ye be circumciſed</hi> [namely with an opinion of obtaining juſtification,
either in whole, or in part, by it] <hi>Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing.</hi> And
again: <hi>Chriſt is become of no effect unto you, whoſoever of you are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi>
[that is, expect, or hope to be juſtified] <hi>by the Law, ye are fallen
from Grace,</hi> Gal. 5. 2, 4. Let us now bind the preſent <hi>Conſideration,</hi>
with what hath been propoſed and argued in it, faſt and cloſe to our
preſent purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Certain it is that God hath provided, yet and at all times, or
at leaſt, ordinarily, even in times moſt threatning the <hi>ſincere</hi> profeſſion
of the Goſpel, affordeth unto his Saints, means both unqueſtionably
lawful, and unqueſtionably ſufficient, (if the Scripture may be Judge
in the caſe) through his accuſtomed Grace and Bleſſing, for their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification,
Comfort, and Salvation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is no leſs certain, that neither is a Prelatical Miniſtry,
nor an attendance hereon, any means, authorized or approved by
God, for the promoting or effecting of theſe ends. From hence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the plain tenour of the premiſes laid down in this <hi>Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
it roundly follows, that either to decline and forſake the means
vouchſafed unto us by God for our Edification and Salvation, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
others, or out of a conceit or pretence of an inſufficiency, or
defectiveneſs in theſe means, for thoſe ends to joyn others with them,
which he hath not authorized, as (by name) the attendance upon a
<hi>Prelatical</hi> Miniſtry (however ſpecious or highly promiſing this means
may be in our eye) is a policy or courſe, much more like to endam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
and hinder us in thoſe great concernments of our ſouls, than any
wayes to bleſs us in promoting them; as it is ſaid of <hi>Tilgath Philnezer</hi>
King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> of whom <hi>Ahaz</hi> King of <hi>Judah</hi> had deſired aid againſt
his enemies, that when he came unto him, <hi>he diſtreſſed him, but ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him not:</hi> Yea, it is added the ſecond time, as a matter worth the
minding, that <hi>he helped him not,</hi> 2 Chron, 28, 20, 21.</p>
               <p>Now that God affordeth unto his People ſufficient means at all
times for their ſpiritual Edification and Salvation, without the help
of a <hi>Prelatical</hi> Miniſtry, might be proved at large from the Scriptures,
if the caſe were doubtful enough to require it. But the more degrees
of viſibility there are in the Object, the fewer degrees of light will
ſerve the viſive faculty to diſcover it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:100311:17"/>
                  <hi>Firſt, The Scriptures themſelves, diligently read, and with a good
and honeſt heart ſearched into, are</hi> able to make us wiſe unto ſalvation,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. And now, Brethren, I commend you to God, and to the
word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
amongſt all them which are ſanctified, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 32. But theſe
<hi>[things]</hi> are written that ye might believe that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the
Son of God, and that believing ye might have life through his Name,
<hi>John 20. 31. Theſe places alſo well underſtood, ſpeak (with many
others) the ſame thing. Luke 16, 29, 31. Pſal.</hi> 19. 7, 8, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi>
1. 19. <hi>John 5. 39. Rom. 15. 4. Heb.</hi> 4. 12.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If any ſhall pretend, that the Scriptures, at leaſt in many
places, are obſcure, and hard to be underſtood aright without a learned
Interpreter; the anſwer is at hand: 1. The great variety of learned
and profitable Expoſitions on all parts of the Scripture, wherewith the
good providence of God hath inriched this Nation in their native
tongue, in theſe our dayes, render ſuch a pretence as this, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the People of God amongſt us, as light as vanity it ſelf: Nor
is it like that the preſent Miniſtry founded upon the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Order
of Prelacy, ſhould be more Canonical or Orthodox, in giving out
the mind of God in the Scriptures, than they. Not to mention the
like variety of elaborate and ſolid diſcourſes, (well nigh) upon all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Subjects, or Heads of matter relating to <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion.
2. It is a generally-acknowledged Truth, That in all things ſimply ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
unto Salvation, the Scriptures are plain, and the ſence of them
obvious to every ordinary underſtanding. 3. (and laſtly, for this) The
Judgments and Underſtandings of many, if not of moſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
have in all ages been led aſide from the mind of God in the Scriptures,
(and this in things of very material conſequence) by the falſe lights of
ſuch their Teachers, who were in great eſteem for parts of learning,
and knowledge in the Scriptures; in whom hath been verified that of
the Prophet: <hi>O my people, they which lead thee, cauſe thee to erre; they
ſwallow</hi> (for ſo the Original) <hi>the way of thy paths</hi> [meaning, that they
do not ſtand much to conſider what they teach thee, either to beleive,
or practiſe] Iſa. 3. 12.—9. 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, The Saints are able to build up one another in Faith, and
Love: yea and are exhortted, or commanded, by God ſo to do:</hi> But ye
Beloved, building up your ſelves on <hi>[or, in]</hi> your moſt holy Faith, praying
in the Holy Ghoſt; Keep your ſelves in the love of God, looking for the
mercy of our Lord, <hi>&amp;c. Jude</hi> 20, 21. Wherefore comfort your ſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and edifie one another, even as ye alſo do, 1 <hi>Theſ. 5. 11. See
alſo Eph. 4. 16. Col. 3. 16. Rom. 15. 14. Heb. 10. 24, 25. Jam.</hi> 5. 19, 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:100311:18"/>
Fourthly, Even the ſmalleſt number of them, two, or three, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together upon ſuch terms as they may at any time, and ſometimes
(at leaſt) ought, may have the preſence of <hi>Chriſt</hi> amongſt them as oft
as they deſire; and conſequently, need not be in any danger of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carrying
in their important deſign of Salvation: <hi>for where two, or three</hi>
(ſaith Chriſt) <hi>are gathered together in my Name</hi> [that is, either out of
Conſcience of my command in that behalf; or rather, out of any real
truſt, or hope, that they may have in God through me] <hi>there am I in the
midſt of them</hi> [meaning to bleſs them, and cauſe them to proſper in
any holy buſineſs they ſhall meet about, the preſence of God, or his
being with, or amongſt, any of his creatures, ſtill importing ſuch a
thing, <hi>Gen. 39. 2, 21, 23. Exod. 3. 12. Joſh. 1. 5. Mat.</hi> 28. 20.
<hi>Deut. 7. 21. Joſh.</hi> 22. 31. and elſewhere, very often] <hi>Mat.</hi> 18 20.
Now ſo ſmall a number of Godly perſons, as <hi>two,</hi> or <hi>three,</hi> may, with a
little prudence and caution, even in the hardeſt, and worſt of times,
meet together in the name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> without much danger from their
enemies. If <hi>Chriſt</hi> had ſaid, <hi>Where five, or ſix, are gathered together
in my name, there,</hi> &amp;c. his preſence amongſt his Saints muſt have been
ſought for by them at their greater péril, and with more obnoxiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
(as it ſeems) to the Laws of men. So then the four means now
mentioned (to which might be added, if need were, others more of a
like character, as Prayer, Meditation, &amp;c.) together with the uſe of
them; are 1. Authorized by the Broad Seal of Heaven, being confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
on all hands approved by God: and 2. (as hath been now ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the cleer light of Divine Revelation) are ſufficient by his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
bleſſing upon them, to build up the precious ſouls of the Saints
in Faith and Love unto Salvation, at leaſt when the great Benefit and
Bleſſing of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and worthy Miniſtry ſhall, by his providence,
either operative, or permiſſive, be denyed unto them. But</p>
               <p>Secondly, Concerning a <hi>Prelatical</hi> Miniſtry, it is <hi>terrae filia,</hi> a
daughter of the earth, being the product, or fruit, of one kind of thoſe
<hi>Tares,</hi> which the enemy took his opportunity to ſow in the field of
God, <hi>whilſt men ſlept,</hi> (Mat. 13. 25.) and hath no Communion with
that Divine Politie of Church-Government, which the Goſpel holdeth
forth, and commendeth unto the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> world; nor hath it been
fed, or nouriſhed, with the <hi>ſincere milk,</hi> but with the blood of the
Scriptures; whoſe genuine ſence in all places arreſted at the ſuit of it,
hath been ſacrificed upon the ſervice of ſo miſchievous an Idol. And
inaſmuch as it came not down from Heaven, it is not like, according
to the courſe of Gods ſtanding providence obſerved in the preſent
<hi>Conſideration,</hi> to help any of his Sons or Daughters thither, but rather
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100311:18"/>
to obſtruct and hinder them in their way: eſpecially it being withal
conſidered, that they are otherwiſe provided of means ſufficient, both
for their preſent Comfort, and future Salvation in due time; and then
ſuch, upon which the light of God's approbation ſhineth clear, yea, and
which, as he hath preſcribed them to uſe, ſo hath he promiſed to bleſs
with the attainment of their end.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="20" type="consideration">
               <head>CONSIDERATION XX.</head>
               <p>When any great ſtorm or tempeſt of Perſecution is raiſed againſt
the ſincere Profeſſion of the Goſpel; and whilſt it is incumbent here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſo that the Saints cannot, with any liberty or freedom, meet open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in their holy Aſſemblies for the Worſhip of God, and their <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi>
Edification, but if they ſhall attempt it, they muſt do it at their
peril, either of loſs of their Liberties by Impriſonment, or of their
Eſtates by Fines or Confiſcations, or of their Country hy Baniſhment,
or of their Lives by Death: under theſe &amp; ſuch like exigencies, <hi>Chriſt</hi>
is wont ſecretly to direct his faithful Ones unto more private opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
for their ſpiritual repaſt, and religious employments, that ſo they
may be ſomewhat more out of the way of their enemies rage, and ſerve
their God with the leſs fear of men: yet he is not wont to incline
them, or to put it into their hearts to disband themſelves, or break up
their reſpective companies, and to become as Sheep ſcattered, every
one feeding a-part by himſelf, and from all his fellows, but to aſſemble
and keep together in ſuch number as they ſhall find willing to accept
of ſuch opportunities, and judge convenient in point of ſafety, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
together. Yea, it is the <hi>Genius</hi> and Property of a ſoul devoted
in Love and Loyalty unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> earneſtly by Prayer to ſeek directions
from him in ſuch hard ſeaſons as we now ſpeak of, whither to repair for
its ſpiritual accommodations, and for his preſence amongſt his Saints.
<hi>Tell me (O thou, whom my ſoul loveth,</hi> ſaith the religiouſly ingaged Soul,
unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Cant. 1. 7.) <hi>where thou feedeſt, where thou makeſt thy Flock
to reſt at noon</hi> [that is, vouchſafe to direct me how and where I may
partake of that ſoul-nouriſhment, and thoſe ſpiritual refreſhments,
wherewith thou art wont to ſupport and comfort thy Saints and People
in their holy meetings <hi>at noon;</hi> that is, in the heat of Perſecution, as
the beſt Interpreters do expound it.] From hence theſe two things are
obſervable. 1. That <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not wont to feed his Sheep in times of
perſecution, where he uſually feedeth them in dayes of liberty and
peace: If this were ſo, there had been no occaſion for the religious
ſoul to have deſired of him to know, where <hi>He fed</hi> his Sheep <hi>at noon</hi> (in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100311:19"/>
the ſence given) ſhe knew well enough where he <hi>fed</hi> them in the cool
and refreſhing times of the day, as evening and morning; as, <hi>viz.</hi> in
open places, where every man might know &amp; come into their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies;
but in the heat and ſcorching time of the day, <hi>at noon,</hi> he ſtill
withdrew them into ſome more ſhady and retired place, where the
danger or troubleſomeneſs of the heat might not interrupt them,
whileſt he ſhould be feeding them. 2. It is further obſervable from
the ſame words, that the ſoul-prudently <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and throughly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive
of her ſpiritual concernments, is not wont to reſt ſatisfied
with her cloſeſt Communion with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or with his giving his loves
unto her in private, but beſides, and beyond this, longeth after thoſe
Communications of himſelf, wherewith he is wont to entertain his
Friends (his Saints I mean) when they gather themſelves in any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
unto him; eſpecially in times dangerous, and threatning unto
thoſe that ſhall thus aſſemble, his heart in theſe times being (uſually)
more enlarged, and his mouth wider opened, unto them, than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary;
even as ſome men count it generous to feaſt their friends more
ſumptuouſly in the time of Lent, than at other ſeaſons. The Soul
which made the requeſt unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> now opened, in the latter part
of the verſe giveth, this reaſon of it; <hi>For why ſhould I be as one that
turneth aſide</hi> [or rather, as the former Tranſlation, with others, read it,
<hi>to,</hi> or <hi>unto] the flocks of thy Companions.</hi> By <hi>the flocks of Chriſt's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,</hi>

Aſſemblies, which have Miniſters or Shepherds only ſo called, ſet
over them, by whom ſhe know that He took no pleaſure to feed any
of his Sheep.</p>
               <p>But that <hi>Chriſt</hi> (as hath been ſaid) in tempeſtuous and foul weather,
(when the ſpirit of the world rageth high againſt Church-meetings) is
not wont to feed his Sheep in the champion, or open fields, where all
men uſe to come, but to lead them into by-places, or ſolitudes, into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
grounds, narrow lanes of a long time diſ-uſed, or un-occupied,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100311:19"/>
under hedg-rows, or the like, and to feed them here; the Scriptures
inform us elſewhere. When <hi>the Woman that brought forth the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child,</hi>
was perſecuted by the Dragon, there were given unto her two
wings of a great Eagle, that ſhe might fly into the wilderneſs, into her

<hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 6. with 13, &amp; 14. Therefore the Woman that brought forth
the Man-child (that is, the ſucceſſive body of Saints, or true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers)
during the times or reign of the Beaſt, is not ſpiritually fed
and nouriſhed in ſuch Aſſemblies or Congregations which are publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
authorized, countenanced, or approved by the Beaſt, or by the
World, which goeth <hi>wondring after him</hi> (Rev. 13. 3.) but in thoſe
which are retired, ſolitary and private, and which neither of them can
well brook or bear, but that God hideth them. The Meetings of
Chriſtians for the exerciſe of their Religion, being hateful unto the
<hi>Jews,</hi> and which they (it ſeems) would not have tolerated amongſt
them, had they had knowledge of them, without doing miſchief, in
one kind or other, to thoſe that thereby ſhould have provoked them:
The Apoſtles themſelves, by the guidance of the Spirit of God (for
they were not, doubtleſs, led unto it by the wiſdom of the fleſh) the
better to ſecure themſelves from their rage when they aſſembled,
1. Made choice of a private houſe to meet in. 2. Of a private time,
the <hi>Evening,</hi> yea, ſome what late in the Evening (as ſome collect from
paſſages recorded, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 29. to <hi>verſ.</hi> 36.) 3. Of as much privacy
in that private houſe, as they could well deviſe; for the doors of the
room where they were, were ſhut: And in this poſture of privacy,
they did enjoy the bleſſed Preſence of <hi>Chriſt. Then the ſame day at
Evening, being the firſt day of the week, when the doors were ſhut, where
the Diſciples were aſſembled for fear of the Jews, came Jeſus, and ſtood in
the midſt, and ſaith unto them, Peace be unto you,</hi> John 20. 19. We reade
of another meeting of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> for the Worſhip of God, under all
the ſame circumſtances of privacy; and this, doubtleſs, upon the
ſame account (I mean, <hi>for fear of the Jews)</hi> Acts 12. verſ. 6, 12, 13,
14. compared: This meeting alſo had <hi>Chriſt</hi> in <hi>the midſt</hi> of it (in the
ſence formerly declared) for by his Mediation and Interpoſure, their
Prayers fetch'd <hi>Peter</hi> out of a ſtrong Priſon with an high hand. So
again, we reade of another religious Meeting of the Apoſtles, together
with a conſiderable number of other <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> in an <hi>upper room,</hi> for
the greater privacy and ſecurity, comers and goers being oft upon
occaſion, and for civility ſake, brought into one, or more of the lower
rooms of an houſe, when there is no occaſion of their going or carrying
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100311:20"/>
up into the higher. Beſides, a continual voice may much more eaſily
be heard, and eſtimated, by thoſe that only paſs by an houſe out of alow room, then from an high; this being more remote, and from
whence, though the ſound of a voice may (poſſibly) be ſometimes
heard below, yet the articulateneſs of it, being confin'd to a narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Sphere, expireth and is loſt by the way. And though Dr. <hi>Hamond</hi>
laboureth in the very fire (as his manner is when any thing occurs him
in his way, that ſeems to frown upon <hi>Epiſcopacy)</hi> to prove, that the
<hi>upper room</hi> here ſpoken of, was not any room in a private houſe, but one
of the upper Cambers of the Temple: yet he hath ſo much of a man
in him (I mean of Ingenuity, whereof when a man ſuffers himſelf to be
diſpoyled, he is only a man ſo called) as to acknowledge (and this
twice over, for failing) that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> here met, <hi>did that more private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which could not, we may perſume, be done in the Temple</hi> [he might
have added, nor in any Synagogue] <hi>in any more publick place, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion being not much favoured</hi> [that is, bitterly hated] <hi>by the Jews,</hi>
[even as the Religious Worſhip of the true Saints of God amongſt us,
is not much favoured by thoſe, that <hi>ſay they are Jews, and are not</hi> (in
the ſence of theſe words, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 9.) And what the Doctor here
granteth; namely, that believing <hi>Chriſtians</hi> kept their holy Aſſemblies
by, and amongſt themſelves, privately, for fear of diſturbance, or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
(in one kind or other) from thoſe, that hated their way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of ſerving God, maketh as much for our purpoſe, as if the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

or, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper room,</hi> which he ſo wearieth himſelf to find in the Temple,
ſhould prove to have been in a private houſe. But whether the word
here tranſlated an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper room,</hi> ſignifieth in this place, an upper Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
in the Temple, or no; certain I am, that <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 8. it ſignifieth
an upper Chamber in a private houſe (or at leaſt, in an houſe common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and properly ſo called) where alſo we find another private Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> (in the ſence we wot of) in the midſt of
them: Elſewhere it ſignifieth (and this twice together, as <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 37.
&amp; 39.) an upper Chamber in a private houſe; but no where at leaſt
in the New Teſtament, an upper Chamber in the Temple. But this by
the way.</p>
               <p>From the tenour and contents of the preſent <hi>Conſideration,</hi> it clearly
appeareth, that in times of trouble, when the Saints are not permitted,
but under great dangers or penalties, to aſſemble themſelves together
for their holy occaſions openly, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not wont to bleſs them, or do
any great things for them in ſuch promiſcuous Congregations, which
are of a worldly complexion and conſtitution, as well Prieſt as People,
and which, upon this account, are publickly countenanced and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100311:20"/>
in; but his manner and good pleaſure hath been, in ſuch hard
ſeaſons as theſe, to allure them into the Wilderneſs, and there to
ſpeak kindly and graciouſly unto them, or to gather them together
under his wings privately, as a hen gathereth her chickens, and ſo to
communicate his heavenly warmth and vivifick influence unto them.</p>

                  <hi>They that keep the Word of Chriſt's Patience,</hi> ſhall be kept by him
<hi>from the hour of temptation,</hi> which will come upon others to try them,
<hi>(Rev.</hi> 3. 10.) whereas they deprive themſelves of the benefit and
bleſſing of this precious Promiſe, who ſhall betray, forſake, or decline
this Word. By the <hi>Word of Chriſts Patience,</hi> though it be with ſome
difference, yet not great neither, underſtood, may (with greateſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,
as I conceive) be meant, any Goſpel-Truth, which is oppoſed
with a ſtrong and high hand, in the place where we live, and can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be owned and profeſſed without ſuffering, or at leaſt, without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of ſuffering in one degree or other: Such a Truth as this, may be
called, <hi>The Word of Chriſt's Patience,</hi> becauſe he is the occaſion, by his
charge upon men in that behalf, why any man ſuffers for the profeſſion
and defence of it at any time: (or more briefly) becauſe it is for his
ſake that any man, in any caſe whatſoever, ſuffereth for it. In a State or
Nation profeſſedly <hi>Pagan,</hi> and where <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> upon what terms
ſoever profeſſed, is a reproach unto thoſe that profeſs it, or matter of
deeper inconvenience, the whole Goſpel, or Doctrine hereof in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
is, and may be called, <hi>The Word of Chriſt's Patience.</hi> In King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
or States, profeſſing <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> the Doctrine of the Goſpel
in general, is never this <hi>Word,</hi> becauſe every man here may profeſs
that he believeth this Doctrine in general, without expoſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to any danger of ſuffering. But the <hi>Word of Chriſt's Patience</hi> in
ſuch Communities of men as theſe, is alwayes ſome particular conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
and weighty Truth of the Goſpel, one or more, which either
plainly and in expreſs words, or elſe conſtructively and by clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
whether in opinion or practice, or both, is denied or oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
either by the Ruling Powers, or by the Miniſters, and others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
Learned and Orthodox, or by the generality of the People here:
So that whoever ſhall <hi>keep this Word,</hi> that is, ſhall diſcover himſelf to
own ſuch a Truth, or ſhall upon occaſion openly plead the cauſe of it,
renders himſelf hereby obnoxious unto the hatred and ill-will of the
one and the other, and conſequently unto all ſuch ſufferings, both for
nature and degree, which they ſhall think meet, and pleaſe to inflict
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100311:21"/>
upon him (God permitting them ſo to do;) as on the contrary they
may be ſaid to let go, ſell, or betray ſuch a Truth, and give it up, as
an Error, into the hand of the enemy, who being convinced in their
conſciences that it is a Word or Truth of Chriſt, ſhall notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
either diſſemble, or deny it, when they ought and are called to
give teſtimony unto it, or ſhall comply with the Adverſaries in their
oppoſition to it.</p>
               <p>Now concerning the Promiſe made by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> unto thoſe that ſhall
<hi>keep the Word of his Patience</hi> (in the ſence given) by being <hi>kept by him
from the hour of temptation, which will come</hi> [or, may come at one time
or other] upon the generality of Chriſtians, <hi>to try them</hi> [throughly, or
with the greateſt and foreſt tryal of all] is meant, That when other
Profeſſors of the Goſpel ſhall, in many places, be tryed with a bloody
perſecution, whereby they will be brought to this ſad exigent, either
to waſte their conſciences by denying ſome manifeſt Truth, or elſe
either to lay down their lives, or to undergo ſomewhat that will be
bitter in the next degree to it; they ſhall be kept or preſerved from
that ſtorm. So that this is the Rule of Equity, by which <hi>Chriſt</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
that he will walk towards thoſe that profeſs his Name and
Goſpel; They that ſhal ſhew themſelves loyal &amp; faithful unto him in
owning any of his <hi>Words,</hi> when they are oppoſed, although their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
in this kind ſhal expoſe them unto, or bring upon them, lighter
ſufferings only, and, which are more eaſie to be born, ſhall notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
upon the account of ſuch their faithfulneſs, be excuſed or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
by him from greater tryals, and which are unto blood: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
thoſe that ſhall faulter with him, and turn their backs upon any of
his <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>Truths,</hi> when the danger of owning them is but little
(comparitively) ſhall be in danger of being expoſed and left by him
unto temptations that are moſt fiery and grievous, and exceeding
difficult to be reſiſted. Let us now apply the conſideration of theſe
things to the buſineſs in hand.</p>
               <p>One of the <hi>Words of Chriſts Patience</hi> amongſt us at this day (and
which, for weight and moment, hath the preheminence amongſt ſome
others that may paſſe under the ſame denomination) is, That <hi>Chriſt
is not onely the Sovereign, or Supream, but the ſole and onely Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver
unto his Church and People, in matters appertaining to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God.</hi> Whether the open aſſerting and maintaining of this
Truth in the terms now expreſſed, and no further, or otherwiſe,
will create danger or trouble unto any perſon amongſt us, or no, I
cannot affirme: But certain I am, that both an oral and practical
maintaining of it, in the right ſenſe and import of the ſaid words, is
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100311:21"/>
of a threatning concernment amongſt us. For if the Legis-lative au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in matters of Divine worſhip, and things requiſite, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
at all times, and in all places, hereunto, be veſted in Chriſt
alone, then they that ſhall keep, own, and give teſtimony unto,
this word, muſt not conſent unto, or comply with; either
in word, or deed, any model or form of praying, any ceremony,
one, or more, in, or about the worſhip of God, any Church-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for the regulating and ordering of this worſhip, which Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
hath not preſcribed, ordered, and appointed, but are introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
impoſed, and commanded, under mulcts, and penalties, by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
power and authority only. For any thing by command made
neceſſary in, or for, the worſhip and ſervice of God, and without
which men are not permitted (but at their peril) to worſhip him,
hereby becomes eſſential to this worſhip, and ſo ſomewhat, and a part,
of it. Thoſe circumſtances, which God commanded in relation to
any main part of his worſhip under the Law, though they were, in
themſelves conſidered, things indifferent, as that the beaſt to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
ſhould be <hi>killed on the ſide of the Altar Northward, Levit.</hi> 1.
11. that the <hi>crop and feathers</hi> of the fowles ſacrificed ſhould <hi>be caſt
beſides the Altar on the Eaſt part,</hi> ver. 16. That <hi>the Prieſt ſhould dip
his finger in the blood</hi> of the Bullock offered, <hi>and ſprinkle it ſeven times
before the vaile, and put ſome of it upon the horns of the Altar, Levit.</hi>
4. 17, 18. All theſe circumſtances (I ſay) with many others of like
conſideration, however indifferent in themſelves, yet being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by God with reference to his worſhip, and ſo that this could
not be performed, regularly and with acceptation, without the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of them, hereby became parts of his worſhip: From whence
(by the way) it is obſervable likewiſe, that for men to claim an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
or right of power, to make indifferent things neceſſary, in,
for, or about, the worſhip of God, is to make themſelves equal in
authority (at leaſt in matters of this high and ſacred concernment)
with God himſelf; and conſequently, to deny Jeſus Chriſt to be the
ſole Law-giver unto his Church in things appertaining to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God. And as under the Law, God himſelf commanded all
indifferent things in, and about, his worſhip, which were in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
commodious, or comely in it, or for it, judging all other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
things, which he left un-commanded in this caſe, to be as
neceſſary and fitting to be thus left (I mean, un-commanded); in
like manner it argueth very unworthy (that I ſay not, blaſphemous)
thoughts of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in any man, to queſtion, either, 1. Whether he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
knew what indifferent things were neceſſary, or in any reſpect,
or degree, would be comely in the worſhip of God under the Goſpel;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100311:22"/>
or 2. Whether he neglected to preſcribe by himſelf, or (which
ſignifieth the ſame) by his Apoſtles, all ſuch particular things; which
he knew to be any wayes needful, or meet, in this worſhip, judging
it better to betruſt the wiſdom and wills of men with the enjoyning
of them, or (at leaſt) of ſome of them, then his own; or 3. (and
laſtly) Whether he did not well know, that it was better, and more
conducing, both to the glory of God, and to the benefit and comfort
of his Church and people, that ſuch indifferent things, as he left free,
and un-commanded, ſhould remain ſo ſtill, and that his counſel in
that behalf, ſhould not be defeated, or made void by men; who
now by their impoſitions of ſuch things, which Chriſt would not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
deal between him, and his people, much alike as <hi>Gehazi</hi> did
between his Maſter <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian: Behold</hi> (ſaith
this unworthy ſervant) <hi>My Maſter hath ſpared Naaman this Syrian,
in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: But, as the Lord
liveth, I will run after him, and take ſomewhat of him:</hi> And being as
good (or rather, as bad) as his word, he undetermined, and diſanul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
through his baſe covetouſneſs, the honourable intention of his
worthy Maſter, which was, that <hi>Naaman's</hi> cure ſhould coſt him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
2 <hi>King.</hi> 5. So do they who <hi>Diotrephes</hi>-like, affect a prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence,
and power in, and over, the Churches of God, which
are incompetent to them, (in effect) ſay: Our Maſter Chriſt ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his Church and people, and was over-indulgent to them in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
appertaining to the worſhip of God, left them at great liberty,
impoſing few external obſervances upon them herein, and thoſe eaſie;
but <hi>as the Lord liveth,</hi> our little finger ſhall be thicker, or heavier,
unto them, than his loynes, we will enſlave them, and ſet task-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
over them, Vicars-Generall, Chancellours, Arch-Deacons,
Officials, Commiſſaries, Apparitors, (who ſhall ſpoil both for
themſelves and for us) Church-wardens, Sides-men, Pariſh-Prieſts,
Pariſh-Clarks, (all, either Apoſtolical, or Apocryphal, Officers in
the Church;) Moreover we will lay a load of Ceremonies and Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
upon them, we will compel them to worſhip and ſerve God
with the ſame Liturgies, Letanies, Collects, and other devices,
wherewith we are content to worſhip him; to hear, where, and whom
we ſhall appoint them to hear; we will make them pray, when we
ſay, pray; bow, when we ſay, bow; kneel, when we ſay kneel;
ſtand up, when we ſay, ſtand up; be uncovered, when we ſay, be
uncovered; ſwear, when we ſay, ſwear; inform, when we ſay, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form:
In a word, we will rule them with a rod of iron, and break
them in pieces like a Potters veſſel, if we find them refractory and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100311:22"/>
diſobedient unto us, and not to do all things that we command them.
Doubtleſs thoſe men, in whom ſuch a ſpirit as this worketh effectually,
do not in good earneſt, and with the whole heart, acknowledg <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt</hi> to be the Sole Law-giver unto his Church and People. For where
he impoſeth one Law or Obſervation upon them, concerning the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and Service of God, they impoſe ten (if not a greater number than
ſo); thus through their pride, and luſt of domineering, utterly defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
and defeating the gracious intendment of <hi>Chriſt</hi> towards them,
which (as was lately ſaid) was to make the yoke of the Worſhip of God,
in reſpect of the external part of it, exceeding eaſie and leight, and to
leave it free and diſ-incumbred, as from the rudiments of the world,
ſo from the Traditions, Ritual Injunctions, and Impoſitions of men.
Therefore they who any wayes countenance or comply with, theſe
men in their clame, or exerciſe of ſuch a power, in or over any of the
Churches of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or ſhall ſubmit unto any of their Injunctions iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
forth, and impoſed, under a pretence, or by vertue of this power,
do not keep, but give up, and betray that <hi>word of Chriſts patience,</hi> which
aſſerteth unto him the Sole Legiſ-lative power over all his Churches,
(as hath been declared) and conſequently, lay themſelves open and
naked unto farre more grievous and formidable temptations, which
ſooner or later they are like to fall into, if not to fall under: For the
promiſe of being kept by Chriſt from ſuch temptations as theſe, is (as
we have heard) made onely unto thoſe, who have <hi>kept the word of his
patience,</hi> [meaning, when the danger of keeping it was leſs, and the
temptation to forſake or betray it, more eaſie to be reſiſted, and to
ſtand upright under]. I ſhall not need (I ſuppoſe) further to add, that
they who do homage with their attendance and dependance upon that
Miniſtry, which is pretended to be erected in the Church, and upheld
by the power which magnifieth it ſelf againſt the Prerogative of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
in his power over his Churches, do moſt notoriouſly and palpably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
that <hi>word of his patience,</hi> which aſſerteth this his Prerogative unto
him (the erecting of a Miniſtry, being one of the moſt daring, inſolent,
and Heaven-affronting actings of that uſurped power), and ſo for fear
of being beaten with Rods, take a direct courſe to be ſcourged with
Scorpions.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome of thoſe important conſiderations, which being
throughly digeſted in the Judgments and Conſciences of good <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi>
cannot (leightly) but ſo affect them, as to cauſe them to diſtaſt
the practice of hearing a Prelatical Miniſtry. I could have encreaſed
the number of them with ſome others, which (haply) might have done
as good execution upon the judgments of ſome, as any of them. But I
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100311:23"/>
am earneſtly perſwaded that God will ere long raiſe up a better work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who by his direction and aſſiſtance, ſhall hammer this nayl to
more purpoſe, then hath yet been done. In the mean time, becauſe
errour, and ſin, have their gloſſes and colours, as well as Truth and
Righteouſneſs, their weight and ſubſtance; let us briefly ſurvey ſome
of the faireſt Pretexts, wherewith the practice hitherto cenſured, and
diſſwaded from, may (probably) hope, yea (poſſibly) be confident,
that ſhe is able to juſtifie her ſelf. Cities and Caſtles, that have been
long built, and were never yet attempted, at leaſt never conquered,
either by ſiege or aſſault, are like to impute their freedome in this
kind, and long continued ſafety, unto their own ſtrength, The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
then, whereby the practiſe condemned in the premiſes, ſeems
moſt deſenſible, are theſe following: And verily I ſhall acknowledge
my ſelf a Debtor, as for a ſignal courteſie, unto him that ſhall either
mend, or improve theſe my Arguments, or offer me others of more
ſtrength.</p>

               <head>Argument I.</head>
               <p>Our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>to the multitude, and to his Diſciples,</hi> ſaith thus;
<hi>The Scribes and the Phariſees ſit in Moſes ſeat: All therefore whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

If it were lawful, yea matter of duty, (for ſo the command, or charge

and no leſs matter of duty, for Chriſtians to obſerve and do, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

                  <head>Anſwer.</head>
                  <p>1. The reaſon why Miniſters of a <hi>Prelatical</hi> Edition ought not to be
heard in their publick teachings, is not becauſe they are a Generation
of men more wicked and vile then the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> were, but
becauſe their delinquency is ſuch, and ſo unhappily conditioned, that
we cannot wait upon them in their Miniſterial employments, without
being partakers with them therein; and we ſtand expreſly charged
by God <hi>not</hi> to be <hi>partakers of other mens ſins,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 22. Eph. 5. 11.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100311:23"/>
(with many other places). For deriving, and accepting, their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial
Function from an <hi>Anti-chriſtian</hi> Power (I mean, ſuch a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
which exalteth it ſelf againſt, and in many things, above the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> acted and exerciſed by him, in and over his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
as was ſhewed in the laſt Conſideration) in and by every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
and adminiſtration of this their Function, they avouch and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
that ſo highly-ſacrilegious an Uſurpation: and they who counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
them with their preſence, whilſt they act this great unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
do nothing leſs then juſtify ſuch their juſtification, and ſo muſt
needs ſhare with them in the iniquity of it. Whereas the <hi>Scribes</hi> and
<hi>Phariſees,</hi> of whom our Saviour ſpeaks in the Text before us, according
to Dr. <hi>Hamand</hi>'s own Paraphraſe of the place, were of the <hi>Sanedrim,</hi>
and <hi>to be looked upon by them</hi> [the people, and his Diſciples themſelves]
<hi>as their lawful Rulers that had Authority over them, ſucceeding Moſes
and the ſeventy Elders,</hi> Numb. 11. 16. According to this notion (which
is not altogether improbable) there was no reaſonable ground of any
ſcruple about hearing them, when they expounded and declared <hi>Moſes</hi>
his Law. And if it could be proved on the behalf of the Miniſters,
whom we judg it unlawful to hear in their Teachings, that they in any
ſuch ſence, <hi>ſit in the Seat,</hi> either of the <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangelists,
Paſtors,</hi> or <hi>Teachers,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when he aſcended up on high, <hi>gave
for the perfecting of the Saints, &amp;c.</hi> neither ſhould we queſtion the
lawfulneſſe, yea or duty (upon occaſion) of hearing them. But the
conjecture of <hi>Grotius</hi> ſeems more rational, and better comporting with
the Scriptures; which is this, That the <hi>Jewes</hi> had no Conſiſtory of
Tryers, nor any perſon or perſons, publickly authorized among them,
to examine, or take account who were meet, or fit to be allowed for
expounders of the Law, but that it was free for any man, whoſe heart
ſerved him for the work, or take it upon him, and to inſtruct and teach
the people accordingly: only adding, that more generally, they who
did take this profeſſion or work upon them, were <hi>Phariſaici inſtituti,</hi>
of the Sect or perſwaſion of the <hi>Phariſees:</hi> As (ſaith he) among the
<hi>Romans,</hi> it was permitted unto any man that would, to plead any mans
Caſe at any Bar of Judicature in their ſtate. That which we read,
<hi>Acts</hi> 13. 15. favours the ſaid conjecture: <hi>And after the reading of
the Law and the Prophets, the Rulers of the Synagogue ſent unto them,
ſaying, ye Men and Brethren, if ye have any word of Exhortation for the
people, ſay on:</hi> which ſeems to imply, that any perſon amongſt them,
might, without breach of any order or cuſtome, teach the people pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
out of the Law and Prophets. If it were thus, neither could
there be any the like reaſon for the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> people to deny their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100311:24"/>
upon the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> in their teachings of the Law,
which, according to the premiſes, there is, why <hi>Chriſtian</hi> people
ſhould ſeparate themſelves from Prieſts of the <hi>Prelatical</hi> Unction in
their preachings of the Goſpel. Theſe pollute themſelves by polu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the moſt Sacred and Bleſſed Name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in accepting
their Office, or Power of Preaching, upon the terms they do, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they become <hi>irregular</hi> for this employment; whereas the other,
ſuppoſing them of competent abilities for the work, committed no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
offered no indignity unto God, in accepting, or entring upon
it.</p>

                  <p>1. This general expreſſion, <hi>every way,</hi> is to be limited and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
according to the Subject matter in hand. There is nothing
more frequent in the Scriptures than to deliver that in general terms,
which yet admits, not of a ſimple, or abſolute univerſality in the
meaning of it, but only of ſuch, which renders it conſiſtent with the
tenor and notion of other Scriptures, and is (for the moſt part) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurable
to the preſent occaſion, <hi>Matth. 23. 3. Mark</hi> 1. 5.—11.
24. <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 1. 10.—6. 30. <hi>John 10. 8. Acts 5. 42. Rom.</hi> 1. 5. (to
omit other inſtances without number). Beſides, it is a common and
true Rule, <hi>Praedicata ſunt talia, qualia à ſubjectis ſuis eſſe permituntar:</hi>
In Propoſitions, the ſence of one part is to be regulated by, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
into the ſence and import of the other. So then the
Apoſtles meaning (in the words before us) is not that the <hi>preaching of
Chriſt,</hi> or that which may (in a ſence) be called, <hi>the preaching of Chriſt,</hi>
in what way, or upon what terms, or by what perſons ſoever, it ſhould,
or could be performed, would be matter of rejoycing: Such a ſence
as this (beſides that the words no wayes neceſſitate unto it, but rather
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100311:24"/>
lead aſide from it, as may be ſhewed preſently) is inconſiſtent with
what we find in the Scripture elſewhere. For when the Devil <hi>preached
Chriſt,</hi> affirming, upon his knowledge, that he was <hi>The Holy One of
God,</hi> Mark 1. 24. Luke 4. 34. And again, that he was <hi>Chriſt, the Son
of God,</hi> verſ. 41. The Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> was ſo far from <hi>rejoycing</hi> in being
thus <hi>preached,</hi> that he <hi>rebuked</hi> the Preacher, and commanded him to
<hi>hold his peace,</hi> Luke 4. 35. 41. Mark 1. 25. Thus the Damſel that
followed <hi>Paul</hi> and thoſe with him, crying out, and ſaying, concerning
them, <hi>Theſe men are the Servants of the Moſt High God, which ſhew
unto us the way of Salvation,</hi> did, in effect, and after a ſort, <hi>preach
Chriſt,</hi> by giving teſtimony unto thoſe, who did truly preach him, yet
<hi>Paul</hi> rejoyced not in this her preaching of him, but on the contrary,
was <hi>grieved</hi> at it (as is expreſly ſaid, Acts 16. 18.) They alſo <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Chriſt,</hi> who <hi>preached</hi> Juſtification and Salvation by him, though not
by him alone, but in Conjunction with Circumciſion, and the works of
the Law; yet neither did <hi>Paul rejoyce</hi> in his being <hi>preached</hi> in ſuch a
manner, or upon ſuch terms, <hi>Acts 15. 1. Gal. 5. 2. 4. Phil.</hi> 3. 2, 3.
<hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 12. compared. Nor is it like that he would have much <hi>rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi>
in his being <hi>preached</hi> by ſuch perſons, of whom he propheſieth,
<hi>Acts 20. 20. Grievous Wolves—not ſparing the Flock.</hi> Amongſt other
Characters of perſons, of whom God himſelf demandeth <hi>What have
you to do to declare my Statutes, or that you ſhould take my Covenant into
your mouth,</hi> this is one; <hi>that when they ſaw a Thief, they conſented with
him,</hi> Pſal. 50. 16, 18. which in a very Emphatical ſence, is found in
thoſe Preachers, whom we judge it unbecoming a good <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to
hear. For in accepting their Office of a Miniſtry from the Hierarchical
Lords, they conſent with them in their ſacrilegious robbing the Lord
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> of that Authority and Honour, which God hath judged
meet to confer upon him, in anointing and appointing him to be the
<hi>Sole</hi> Law giver unto his Churches in things appartaining to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and Service of God, as well in things to be practiſed, as in things
to be believed. But of this we have ſpoken formerly. By what hath
been ſaid to the <hi>Argument</hi> in hand, it is ſufficiently evident, that the
Apoſtle's general expreſſion concerning <hi>Chriſt's</hi> being <hi>preached every
way,</hi> is to be understood with limitation; and conſequently, that no
Argument, or Proof for any thing, can be drawn from the generality
of it.</p>
                  <p>2. In propriety and ſtrictneſs of ſpeaking, <hi>Christ</hi> cannot be ſaid to
be <hi>preached</hi> by a <hi>Prelatical</hi> Miniſtry. For only then he may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
ſaid to be <hi>preached,</hi> when he is preached, and ſet forth, like unto
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100311:25"/>
himſelf, without any diminution, impairment, or diſ-mantling of his
glory: and if any perſon be preached under the name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> unto
whom any part of that glory is denyed by thoſe who preach him, in, or
by, their act of preaching him, which is appropriate unto the true <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
the <hi>Christ of God,</hi> it is not this <hi>Christ,</hi> but another, an Idol <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is
preached. Now the Miniſters we ſpeak of, in, and by, their very act,
or deed, of preaching, juſtifie thoſe, who both in words, but eſpecially in
deeds, deny the true <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be the Sole Lawgiver unto his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
(as hath been proved) which yet is one of the richeſt, and moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
and ſhining Gems in that Crown of Glory, which God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath ſet upon his head: and whilſt they preach ſuch a <hi>Chriſt</hi> as this
(a <hi>Chriſt</hi> who hath no ſuch Prerogative, or Royalty, belonging to him,
as a Sole power of Legis-lation unto his Churches, but hath weak and
ſinful men joynt-ſharers with him in his Authority in this kind) do not
preach the true, the real <hi>Christ, the Christ of God</hi> (as <hi>Peter</hi> termeth him,
<hi>Luke</hi> 9. 20.) but a <hi>Chriſt</hi> formed in their own imaginations, &amp; having no
exiſtence but here only, and in the fancies of their Proſelites, and is not
able to juſtifie men from their ſins, nor to ſave their ſouls, though (it is
like) they aſcribe theſe great things unto him, as Idolaters in all Ages
have been wont to attribute the great works of God unto their Idols.
And as <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid <hi>to APPEAR in Heaven for us,</hi> (Heb. 9. 24.)
meaning, that his very <hi>appearance</hi> before God, conſidering what he
hath done, and ſuffered on our behalf, is, without any other expreſſion,
or application of himſelf unto him, as by oral requeſt, proſtration, or
the like, a moſt effectual interceding with him for us: In like manner
the Sole <hi>appearance</hi> of a Prelatical Miniſter in the Pulpit to perform
the act of preaching, it being known and conſidered, how, and by what,
or whoſe, Authority, he <hi>appears</hi> upon ſuch an account here, is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceding,
or pleading, with all that are before him, for that <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi>
and lawleſs power, which is blaſphemouſly claim'd, and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
by the great Maſters of the Hierchy, and conſequently, againſt
that Moſt Sacred Prerogative of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which giveth him the honour
of being the Sole Law-giver unto his Churches. And as the Apoſtle
ſpeaketh of ſome, <hi>Who</hi> [in words] <hi>profeſs that they know God, but in
works they deny him,</hi> (Tit. 1. 16.) So in caſe ſuch a Miniſter as this,
ſhould in his Doctrine, or Sermon, affirm <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be the Sole
Lawgiver unto his Churches, yet in, and by, his very act of preaching
he ſhould deny it.</p>
                  <p>3. (and laſtly) This diſtribution, <hi>Whether in pretence, or in truth,</hi>
plainly ſheweth, that the Apoſtle in his general expreſſion of <hi>Chriſt's</hi>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:100311:25"/>
being <hi>preached every way,</hi> intended only theſe two; his being <hi>prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,</hi>
either <gap reason="foreign">

or, in truth. Now <hi>Chriſt</hi> may be ſaid to be <hi>preached,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<hi>in pretence,</hi> when they who <hi>preach</hi> him, are acted and moved hereunto
by indirect and unworthy ends, and yet would be thought to <hi>preach</hi>
him <hi>in truth,</hi> [that is, out of a ſincere and upright intention, and deſire,
to ſerve God, and man in the work.] And inaſmuch as they who
<hi>preach Chriſt</hi> out of ſiniſter and by-ends, may nevertheleſſe be free
from Scandal, and from the guilt of any ſuch known Act, or Practiſe,
whereby <hi>Chriſt</hi> is denied in any of the Divine Royalties appropriate
to his Kingly Office, or annexed to his Mediatory Throne, their <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Chriſt,</hi> if it be according to the true tenor and purport of the
Goſpel (as it may be, and as it ſeems, theirs was, by whom <hi>Paul</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
he was <hi>preached in pretence)</hi> in reſpect of the Glory that may
hereby redound unto God, and the benefit that may accrue unto men,
is juſt matter of <hi>rejoycing</hi> unto a ſober and conſiderate Chriſtian: yea,
though it ſhould be revealed unto him by God (as it was unto <hi>Paul</hi> in
the caſe before us) that ſuch a man's aims or ends in preaching, are not
honourable, or <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> But this maketh nothing for the countenanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

aſide their compliance with Prelatical Uſurpations and Superſtitions,
the great evil whereof may not as yet be arrived at their judgments)
are Chriſtianly Orthodox, both in their Lives and Doctrines: Nay, I

tempted many of the true friends, and faithful Servants of God,
into the embracements of it. But,</p>
                  <p>2. Our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proverb, which remindeth us, that <hi>All is not Gold,
that gliſtereth,</hi> may a little quallifie our credulity, without making any
breach upon our Charity, in the caſe in hand; conſidering that the
great Apoſtle himſelf, in reference hereunto, ſpeaketh as much (if not
much more) where he informeth us, as of a Secret, that <hi>it is no great
thing</hi> [that is, no wonderful, or rare thing, as the word, <hi>great,</hi> often
ſignifieth in the Scriptures] <hi>if the Miniſters of Satan be transformed as

For (doubtleſs) as well the latter, as the former, are in the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of ſupporting an <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Intereſt and Power, and
this even by that which is commendable, and pleaſing unto men, either
good, or bad, both in their Lives, and in their Doctrine: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

the holy project and deſign of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which is, that his
Saints may <hi>ſerve him without fear</hi> [as well of ſufferings from men, as
from God] <hi>in holineſs and righteouſneſs before him all the dayes of their
lives,</hi> Luke 1. 74, 75. And it hath been ſeldome, or never known,
that any great community, body, or party of men in the World, have
long ſubſiſted (at leaſt upon any competent terms of credit, peace, or
ſafety) but by means of ſome few of their Members (reſpectively)
who by their wiſdom &amp; worth above their fellows, have been as pillars
to bear up their ſeveral Polities, or Parties, and keep them from ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>James, Cephas,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> ſaith, they <hi>ſeemed</hi>
[or, <hi>were counted,</hi> as our former tranſlation had it] <hi>pillars,</hi> (meaning,
to ſupport the Chriſtian Intereſt in the world.) As though there be
ſome thouſands of Laths, and many ſlight pieces for partitions, and
otherwiſe, in a building, yet thoſe few Subſtantial and main pieces of
ſound Tymber, unto which the Architect coupleth and faſtneth the
reſt of his work, are they which give ſtrength unto the houſe, and make
it able to endure, and ſtand, all winds and weather. So that when God
(whether out of his wiſdom, for the tryal of thoſe, who profeſs his
Name, or out of Judgment, to puniſh their unworthineſs, or upon
what other account ſoever, whether known, or unknown, unto us) plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
to give way unto Satan, by his ſubtile and plauſible inſinuations
and ſuggeſtions ſo far to tamper with the hearts and ſpirits of ſome
Profeſſors of the Goſpel, as between them, to raiſe up, and ſet on foot,
and for any conſiderable Tract of time to maintain and keep on foot,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100311:27"/>
a corrupt Intereſt under ſome Religious pretence (one, or more) in
the Chriſtian world, he is pleaſed likewiſe to ſuffer the plauſible pleas,

worldly accommodations which it promiſeth unto thoſe, that ſhall eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſe

ſo familiarly acquainted: only (as it ſeems by what <hi>Mark</hi> affirmeth,
Chap. 16. 12.) he was ſomewhat diſguiſed in his apparel; yet all this
while their eyes were as open to ſee and diſcern all other objects, but
onely the face of Chriſt, as at other times. In like manner the eyes of
the minds and underſtandings even of men piouſly-learned and grave,
may, upon Gods withholding his wonted concurrence with them in
reference to the diſcerning of ſuch, and ſuch particular Truths, be ſo
deluded, captivated, and bewitched with the falſe colours and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
of truth in the contrary-errors, that they will without fear, or
ſcruple, embrace theſe, yea and with an high hand of confidence and
importunity, riſe up to juſtifie and maintain them: when as they may
all this while approve themſelves for men of an exact judgement, and
diſcerning ſpirit between truth and error, in other caſes. Men of this
Character, or (at leaſt) ſeemingly ſuch (I mean, holy and good men,
generally quick-fighted, but particularly blinded) generally have been,
and are at this day, the main Props, and Supporters of all thoſe adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
and Anti-Evangelical Intereſts, and Combinations of men,
which are found in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> world: (although I make a little more
queſtion, whether they alſo were ſuch, who were the firſt Founders, and
Authors of them.) Such perſons as theſe now and then found within
the Territories of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> profeſſion, have been, and are, the breath
of the Noſtrils of that Religion: Such as theſe, taking part with the
Admirers of, and Contenders for, the Common-Prayer-Book, preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed

helpers in chief to prolong the days of that Intereſt, which otherwiſe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100311:27"/>
would ſoon be Apoſynagogized by the <hi>Christian</hi> world. And were
there not ſome perſons of the Character mentioned in the numerous

by teaching them to lay claim to both Swords, as well the
Spiritual, as the Temporal; neither would this Generation, or Sect
of men, lift up their heads at that rate of height and confidence, which
now they do. It were eaſie to adde many more inſtances, if need

of it from the <hi>Great Apoſtle and High Prieſt,</hi> of Chriſtian <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi>

<hi>have compaſſion</hi> on it (as the <hi>Ziphims</hi> had on <hi>Saul,</hi> when he perſecuted
<hi>David, 1 Sam.</hi> 23. 21.) and in, and by, the exerciſe of their Miniſtry,
are the chief Contributers towards the maintenance of the life of it in
the world. Therefore thoſe worthy qualifications of <hi>holineſs</hi> and <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
in ſuch Miniſters, are ſo far from, being any reaſonable Grounds,

18. 4. ſheweth that there may be converſion of Souls, even in <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
and this (as ſeems not improbable) by the Spurious Miniſtry that is
exerciſed here. It is no wayes like, that thoſe perſons, whom God, by
the Name of, <hi>his people,</hi> warneth by a voice from Heaven, to <hi>come out
of Babylon,</hi> were <hi>his People</hi> [that is, truly regenerate, and believing]
before they entered into <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that afterwards they went, and
took up their dwellings here. If converſion may be wrought by a <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſh</hi>
Miniſtry, it is a clear caſe that it is not univerſally, and in all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
a convincing proof of a legitimate and true Miniſtry. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whereas the Apoſtle termeth the <hi>Corinthians, the ſeal of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtleſhip,</hi>
it was not ſimply, or ſo much, in reſpect of their converſion
by him unto the Faith, but rather in reſpect of the extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and high hand of divine power, which appeared with him, and in
him, for their converſion; without which he ſeems to imply, that in
reſpect of their more than ordinary indiſpoſition to ſubmit unto the
Goſpel, being a wealthy and worldly-wiſe people, and under ſeveral
diſadvantages otherwiſe, there had been little likelyhood of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
to the Faith, eſpecially, in ſuch conſiderable numbers, as now,
by this means had embraced it. For upon ſome ſuch account as this it
is, that he reminds them in theſe words, <hi>Truly the ſignes of an Apostle
were wrought among you in all patience, in ſignes, and wonders, and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
deeds,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 12. From this paſſage, and the words next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
with ſome others in theſe two Epiſtles it appears, that God
judged it neceſſary and meet that this his Apoſtle ſhould make more
uſe of his gift of Miracles amongſt this people, in order to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
and confirmation in the Faith, then in any other place, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he was ſent to preach the Goſpel. This plainly ſheweth them to
have been a Generation of men of that Character, which our Saviour
pointeth at in thoſe, to whom he ſaid, <hi>Except ye ſee ſignes and wonders,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100311:28"/>
ye will not believe,</hi> John 4. 48. which temper, or complexion of mind,
argueth a great eſtrangement in men from God, and an utter un-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintedneſs
with his Nature and Attributes. Therefore the Apoſtle
affirming the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to be, <hi>the Seal of his Apoſtleſhip</hi> [meaning, an
effectual proof, and confirmation of the truth of it, and that he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it from God] intendeth it not in reſpect of their converſion by
him, ſimply conſidered, but of thoſe miraculous appearances of God
with him, for, and in, the effecting of it. So that nothing can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from hence to prove true converſion unto God, to be alwayes,
or in all caſes, an argument, or proof, that that Miniſtry, by which it is
wrought, is from God. For the further clearing of which it may be
conſidered,</p>
                  <p>2. That God, in his diſpenſations, and applications of himſelf unto
the children of men, putteth a very great difference between times of
ignorance, and times of knowledge; indulging many things in way of
favour, mercy, and compaſſion, unto perſons offending through the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of his will, when this ignorance is not affectate, or willingly,
and upon a curſed deſign of ſinning more freely, kept and maintained
in the ſoul, but hath been, and is, occaſioned, either by the ſcantneſs
of Light, or ſhortneſs of the means about them, whereby to come to
the knowledge of the truth, or elſe by the weakneſs and flowneſs of
their underſtandings, or elſe by meer incogitancy, or that backwardneſs
of making diſtrict enquiry after truth, which ſo eaſily (and almoſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally)
beſetteth fleſh and blood; or laſtly, by means of a ſtrong
and flattering perſwaſion that they know the truth already, and ſo need
not make any ſuch enquiry after it; God (I ſay) is wont to make many
large allowances in grace and favour unto thoſe that are ignorant of
his will upon any of the occaſions now mentioned, though they act
contrary to it, which he will at no hand indulge unto thoſe, that either
know, or eaſily may know it, and yet will notwithſtanding walk in the
ſight of their own eyes, and in the ways of their own hearts. This obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
(I verily believe) for both number and clearneſs of Scripture
teſtimonies, may compare with any other truth aſſerted here. The pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that ſpeak to the heart of it, were they drawn together, and a little
argued, would amount to a juſt Volume. I ſhall mention onely one (a
Text well known) and point to a few others. <hi>And the times of this ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
God winked at: but now commandeth all men every where to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent;
becauſe he hath appointed a day</hi> [that is, he now maketh known
unto the world that he hath <hi>appointed a day;</hi> for the <hi>day</hi> was <hi>appointed</hi>
as much in the former times, as now: but things in Scripture are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

ſaid to be done, when they are made manifeſt] <hi>wherein he will
judge the world in righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Acts 17. 30, 31. It is evident
from hence in the general (for we muſt not now ſtand to ſcan particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars)
that God was much more favourable to the ſame kind of ſinners,
who ſinned in times of ignorance, then he was reſolved to be unto thoſe
that ſhould ſin in times of greater light. If you queſtion in the leaſt

that during that long tract of time, wherein God judgeth it meet to

and the un-natural ſwellings of <hi>Epiſcopal Power,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to ſuffer the reaſons &amp; underſtandings of thoſe, who otherwiſe
might, and (doubtleſs) would have detected, and withſtood, thoſe
high Uſurpations over his free-born Sons and Daughters to be ſo held,
or otherwiſe incumbred and diverted, as to overlook the intimations
of his mind in the Scriptures againſt thoſe monſtrous exorbitancies in
his Church; that God (I ſay) during the times of this ignorance, and
incogitancy, amongſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> might in mercy do good to the ſouls
of ſome, even by ſuch a Miniſtry, which he never allowed, nor appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
but onely tollerated until the times of Reformations yea, and
which he will not allow his people to countenance, or credit, by reſort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto it, when once he hath cauſed the irregularity of it to be
brought to light, and the Goſpel to utter and ſpeak out that enmity,
which it beareth to it. Nor is it like, that when he ſhall have plainly,
and to the full conviction of reaſonable and ſober men, diſcovered the
nakedneſs and ſhame of it, that ever he will have to do, or co-operate
with it, either to the converſion, or edification, of any ſoul more.
And as <hi>Abraham</hi> lived well, enjoyed the love of God, throve in his
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100311:29"/>
eſtate, and proſpered in the world, whilſt he lived in his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
amongſt his kindred, and in his Father's houſe, before God called
him out from hence to dwell in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> where he intended
to bleſs and proſper him yet ſeven times more, whereas had he diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed
the call of God, and continued in his Father's houſe ſtill, this
call notwithſtanding, doubtleſs he had highly provoked God, neither
would his own Countrey, Kinred, or Father's houſe, have been the ſame
unto him in comfort and peace, which formerly they had been: In like
manner, though an honeſt and upright ſoul may be in the love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of God, and thrive competently in its ſpiritual eſtate, under a
<hi>Prelatical Miniſtry</hi> (and haply in <hi>Babylon</hi> it ſelf) whileſt it remains ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the mind and will of God concerning its removal, and
wanteth light to diſcern the evil of ſuch ſtandings; yet if it ſhall
chuſe, and reſolve, to keep theſe poſtures, or ſtandings, after that God
ſhall have called unto it to forſake them, they are not like to yield any
of their former accommodations unto it, nor is God like to take the
ſame delight in (or rather to ſhew the ſame compaſſion on) this ſoul,
which he did before: but according to the obſervation, and ſaying of
<hi>David, He turneth a fruitful Land into barrenneſs, for the wickedneſſe
of them that dwell therein,</hi> Pſal. 107. 34. If it be demanded; but
when, or how, doth God call any ſoul, or perſon, from under a <hi>Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi>
Miniſtry, or out of <hi>Babylon?</hi> I anſwer; when by a clear light he
diſcovers the ſinfulneſs, or (which is the ſame, in effect the danger,
or threatning conſequence, of a mans abiding under the former, or in
the latter. Conviction of any thing ſinful, or unlawful, in any of our
wayes, is a loud call from God unto repentance and reformation. And
as <hi>Abrahams</hi> obedience unto the call of God, when he called him out
from his own <hi>Country, Kinred, and Fathers houſe,</hi> is commended by this,
that <hi>he went out, not knowing whither he went,</hi> (Heb. 11. 8.) but ſped
never the worſe for this: So when God ſhall call us from under an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
Miniſtry, it is not <hi>Chriſtian</hi>-like to make any ſuch allegation, or
plea, as this, againſt our ready and cheerful ſubmiſſion to his call; we
know not where we ſhall mend our ſelves, or find the like ſpiritual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,
we are like to be loſers by the change, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It would be much
more worthy a Son, or Daughter, of God in this caſe, to conſider and
work upon that which <hi>David</hi> immediately ſubjoyneth to the paſſage
lately cited from him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>He turneth the WILDERNESSE into a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
water, and dry ground into water ſprings; and there he maketh the
hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a City for habitation,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal.
107. 35, 36, 37, 38. They who ſhall forſake a polluted Miniſtry,
though otherwiſe plauſible, and in all points beſides lively reſembling
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100311:30"/>
the true Miniſtry of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> upon divine conviction of the pollutedneſs
of it, need not fear that they ſhall be loſers in their ſpiritual eſtates
hereby, or ſuffer in their inner man. The <hi>woman cloathed with the Sun</hi>
Rev. 12. when ſhe fled from the City into the <hi>wilderneſs,</hi> being (as
it appears) admoniſhed by God ſo to do, had a place here prepared
for her by God, where ſhe was <hi>fed</hi> and <hi>nouriſhed</hi> [with a more whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
diet, doubtleſs, then ſhe ſhould have been in the City] for
many years.</p>
                  <p>3. Although for argument ſake, and in part (I confeſs) for proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
ſake, and likelihood of truth, it hath been granted, that ſome
have been truly and ſavingly converted to the faith, and ſome edified,
by a <hi>Prelatical</hi> Miniſtry, yet I believe it will ſorely rack the parts and
learning of the greateſt Patrons of it, to make any demonſtrative proof
of either, eſpecially of the former. It was a right and uſeful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that to take <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that
which follows in time for the effect of that which goeth before, is a
common miſtake amongſt men. Thoſe that have been converted after,
or upon the hearing of a Sermon, poſſibly might not be converted by
it. Again, it is well known unto thoſe, that are but competently ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in Eccleſiaſtical Records, as well of ancient, as of latter times,
that great numbers both of men and women, have been ſavingly
wrought upon by other means and diſpenſations of God, and not by
hearing Miniſters of a <hi>Prelatical</hi> creation. Not to inſiſt upon particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
in this kind, as either the converſion of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> by reading the
<hi>Sibylline</hi> Oracles, as ſome of theſe records report; or of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten

Miniſtry; the Miniſters of this Order exerciſing their Miniſtry in

ſuch purpoſes, by the Civil Magiſtrate, and ſo had no occaſion to <hi>flee
into the Wilderneſs,</hi> or to ſeek ſolitary and private places for the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
of their talent in this kind]: Unleſs we ſhall conceive, that
the <hi>Woman</hi> we ſpeak of, was all along ſupplyed with children out of the
City, by the publique Miniſtry here, God, ſecretly admoniſhing, and
perſwading thoſe Sons and Daughters of his, that were begotten by
ſuch illegitimate Fathers, as ſoon as, or not long after, they were ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
born, to with-draw themſelves from under the hand of ſuch Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

of their heart, ſuſpecting no evil in ſuch an action, comport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(I might ſay, compounded) with the <hi>Prelates</hi> for their Miniſterial

them the great honour of co-operating with them to the bringing
home of ſouls unto God. But,</p>
                  <p>1. The number of theſe was but ſmall, ſcarce exceeding the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of <hi>one of a City, and two of a Tribe.</hi> Out of the great Cloud of
<hi>Prelatical</hi> Prieſts (for their Ordination baptizeth them by that name,
nor are they offended at it) Sathan rained upon the people, Snares of
Idolatrous and Superſtitious conceits, and practiſes, without end: and
in theſe ſnares of death the feet of the greater part of the poor igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
ſouls in the Nation, are taken, and held faſt, to this day. Nor is
it any breach of charity to conceive and think, that for the greateſt part
of theſe Miniſters, were in their courſe of preaching, more zealouſly
bent to beget Sons and Daughters to the Church of <hi>England</hi> (in their
notion) than unto God; although poſſibly (to allay all ſeeming hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in the ſaying) they might ſuppoſe that men and women being
made the true Sons and Daughters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> were
hereby made the true Sons and Daughters of God alſo. For what may
not <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>Intereſt,</hi> conſpiring together, ſuppoſe? Doth not the
Apoſtle, ſpeaking of <hi>men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the Truth</hi>
ſay, that they <hi>ſuppoſed gain</hi> to be <hi>godlineſs,</hi> admoniſhing <hi>Timothy</hi> to

1 Tim. 6. 5. But for the <hi>Church of England,</hi> who ſhall live,
when either of her Sons, or Fathers, will be able to declare her
Generation, or ſatifie the world, who, or what kind of creature
ſhe is?</p>
                  <p>2. Thoſe few Miniſters of the <hi>Prelatical</hi> Sanction, whom <hi>Chriſt</hi>
was pleaſed to ſeparate from their fellows, in bleſſing their labours to
the begetting of Sons and Daughters unto God in the Nation, were
ſmoak in their noſes, and as thorns in the eyes, of thoſe who had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
them with a Miniſterial employment, being by them looked
upon as a ſpurious and illegitimate brood of children, and as walking
contrary to the Intereſt, both of the Spiritual Lords, their Fathers, and
of the Lady, the <hi>Church of England,</hi> their myſterious Mother: Yea, for
their laboriouſneſs, zeal, and faithfulneſs unto God, and men, in the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100311:31"/>
work of their Miniſtry, which, by reaſon of the ſucceſs that God gave
unto them in the hearts and affections of the people, their Ghoſtly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were not able, or rather, not willing to diſtinguiſh from
Schiſm, Faction, Popularity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they were evil entreated, injuriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
handled, vexed with Summoners and Apparitors, cited into their
Courts (where they muſt, at their peril, appear at the day and hour
appointed, how long and weariſome, how unſeaſonable, or experſive,
how tempeſtuous, or dangerous ſoever their journey hither ſhould
be) here to be falſely charged, to be vilified, and reproached, before
all that are preſent, by Chancelors, Commiſſaries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (perſons who
many times know not their right hand from their left, in things apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
unto God; as meet to fit in judgement upon a learned and
godly Miniſter, as in the Greek proverb, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as an Aſſe

or ſuſpended, deprived, degraded, impriſoned, yea conſtrained through
an experimental ſence of the implacableneſs of theſe bloody aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
to commit themſelves unto the Seas, how inconvenient or dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
ſoever, either through age, tenderneſs or weakneſs of conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
preſent indiſpoſition of body, or otherwiſe ſuch journying were
like to prove unto them, and to ſeek for a Sanctuary in ſtrange Lands.
So that the Miniſters that with greateſt zeal and faithfulneſs planted
the ſaving knowledge of God, and promoted the Intereſt of true
Godlineſs in the Nation, though (being led out of the way by the falſe
light of thoſe times) they owned the <hi>Prelates</hi> in their Uſurpations, by
accepting their Office of Miniſtry from their unhallowed hands, yet
the <hi>Prelates</hi> ſoon after, namely, as ſoon as they ſaw or heard, that they
<hi>held a ſtraight courſe</hi> in preaching the Goſpel, diſowned them, and
took from them, at leaſt from many of them, and their will was the
ſame towards them all, but that prudentials hindered the ſameneſs of
execution upon ſome, by ſilencing and ſuſpending them, the exerciſe
of that Miniſtry, and ſo in effect, the Miniſtry it ſelf, which they had
conferr'd upon them. So that by this time, if we reſpect the reality
of things rather than the rigour or formality of words, the Miniſters we
now ſpeak of, were no Miniſters of a Prelatical inveſture: for they who
had inveſted them, deveſted them again. Adde hereunto (that which we
may, not only in charity, but according to the guidance of reaſon it
ſelf, ſuppoſe their conſcienciouſneſs and loyalty unto God, in all other
their wayes and actings conſidered) that had they known or once
ſuſpected, the great evil of putting their heads under <hi>Prelatical</hi> hands
to receive an Evangelical function from them, they would rather have
ſuffered them to be taken from their ſhoulders, as <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt's head
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100311:32"/>
was, by the hands of the common Executioner. This being ſo, they
were but in a very deminutive ſenſe Miniſters of a <hi>Prelatical</hi> Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nor ought they in reaſon, to be ſimply, or abſolutely, termed ſuch.
For when the mind and will of a man are really ſet and bent againſt the
doing of any thing whatſoever, that is ſinful, in caſe he ſhall through
ignorance, or miſtake, do any thing which is ſinful, this action is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
unto him onely in the letter, not in the ſpirit of it: For ſo far as
his will ſtood againſt it, and was not conſenting to it [that is, or as far
as, it was ſinful] it was not properly, or in a moral and equitable conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
his action, but rather to be charged upon the ignorance that
was in him; nothing that a man doth, being, in moral equity, and fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of conſtruction, chargeable upon him as his action, but onely what
his will, and as far as his will, was conſenting unto in the doing of it;
according to that of the Apoſtle, (who is not wont to flatter himſelf, or
to extenuate, or deny his ſinful infirmities at any time) <hi>Now if I do that,
which I WO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LD NOT, it is NO MORE I that do it, but ſin that
dwelleth in me,</hi> Rom. 6. 20. Yet further, the Miniſters of whom we
now ſpeak, &amp; by whom much real good was done to the ſouls of many
in the Nation, applyed themſelves wholly and intirely to the work of
Chriſt in preaching the Goſpel, and did not make merchandize of the
word of God bywreſting or perverting it at any time, as if it any where
ſpake to the heart of the <hi>Prelatique</hi> Intereſt, or recommended any ſuch
Officer, or Ruler, unto the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as a Prelate, or Biſhop,
(in the by-ſenſe, or high ſenſe of the word, or gave him power to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude
what, and what numbers, of Ceremonies, and Apocryphal pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and prayers only ſo called, he pleaſed, upon the people of God, as
well Miniſters, as others, upon ſevere penalties to be inflicted on thoſe
whoſe Conſciences were not wide enough to ſwallow them. Now ſuch
Miniſters, who, though having received their Office from <hi>Prelates;</hi> yet
ſhall in the courſe and work of their Miniſtry, wholly and conſtantly
wave, and decline their cauſe from the one end of it to the other, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
opening their mouths to caſt reſpects, either upon their Office, or
any thing, that hath ſo much as one lineament of their <hi>Image,</hi> or one
letter of their <hi>Superſcription,</hi> upon it, and inſtead hereof, ſhall zealouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and faithfully preach up <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> in the glory of all his Offices,
as the Goſpel aſſerteth and declareth them, which conſequentially, is
the preaching down of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> as the bringing in of the <hi>Ark</hi> of God
unto <hi>Dagon's</hi> Temple, was the downfal and deſtruction of that Idol; ſuch
Miniſters, I ſay, that ſhall quit themſelves in the way of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
upon ſuch termes as theſe, do conſtructively, and in effect, and
with as much advantage to the glory of God, and edification of men,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100311:32"/>
renounce their <hi>Prelatical</hi> Ordination, as if they ſhould do it more lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally
and formally. So then, all things weighed in the ballance of
equity, the Miniſters, unto whom God gave the honour to <hi>triumph in
Chriſt,</hi> (as the Apoſtle's phraſe is (2 Cor. 2. 14.) and by whom to <hi>make
manifeſt the ſavour of his knowledge</hi> amongſt the Inhabitants of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
were not Miniſters of a <hi>Prelatical</hi> Ordination (in any compleat,
direct, or thorough ſence of the denomination) but only in ſome ſuch
myſterious and obſcure notion, as that, wherein the Beaſt is termed,
the <hi>Beast which is not, and yet is,</hi> Rev. 17. 8. They that were round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
right down, without any abatement, or need of explication, ſuch
have, amongſt them, in matters of true Religion, ſound knowledge, and
piety towards God, reduced the generality of the Nation to a morſel

all that bloody ignorance and prophaneſſe, all that cuſtomary bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

diſpleaſure, may juſtly call this Generation of men, either Fathers, or
Foſter Fathers, or both.</p>

               <head>Argument V.</head>
               <p>Many learned and good men have been, and many ſuch at this day,
are very confident, that ordination by <hi>Biſhops,</hi> in the high ſenſe of
the word, is regularly founded on the Scriptures; yea, and that there
can be no lawful, or true Miniſter any where created, where there is
not the hand of ſuch a Biſhop to ſanctifie the action, and to raiſe it to
that worth and dignity, that it may be meet to yeild the ſacred fruits
of a Goſpel-Miniſtry. And it is generally known, and acknowledged,
that Ordination of Miniſters by Biſhops, in the upper ſignification of
the word, hath been very antiently, and for many ages by-paſt, practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in the Church, ſcarce any man queſtioning, or contradicting it.
Therefore why ſhould the hearing of ſuch miniſters be now cenſured
as unlawful?</p>
               <div type="answer">
                  <head>Anſwer.</head>
                  <p>This <hi>Argument</hi> calleth for the conſideration of ſundry particulars for
it's full and due ſatisfaction: Others, many have largely and ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
anſwered all that is pretended, and pleaded, from the Scripture, in
the behalf, either of the Order or Office of Biſhops, in the ſence of
the word lately ſpecified, or of their Sole power of Ordination: So
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100311:33"/>
that as unto theſe, I ſhall be very curſory and brief, chiefly pointing at
the heads of ſome few Conſiderations, whereby it will be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
that although all that the Argument ſaith and pretendeth unto,
ſhould be granted as true, yet all will ſignifie little, or nothing, as to
the proof of what is intended. Therefore,</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Learning,</hi> is very neer of kin unto <hi>knowledge,</hi> if it be not the
ſame. Now <hi>knowledge,</hi> though it be a very uſeful and commendable
endowment, yet it hath one bad property, (which the Apoſtle himſelf
taketh, and giveth notice of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 8.) <hi>it puffeth up;</hi> that is, it is
apt to lift men up into a confident conceit that there is more worth in
them, than in deed and in truth there is. Neither will a very good
degree of goodneſs in the ſame ſubject, at many turns, and in many
caſes, prevent the operation of this evil property upon it. Learned
and knowing men, though good men, will too frequently aſſume more
unto themſelves, than by the aſſignment of God, or good reaſon, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to their ſhare. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> plainly ſignifieth that God knew
that he would have been <hi>exalted above meaſure through the abundance of
revelations</hi> vouchſafed unto him, if the exceſſive heat of his propenſion
in this kind had not been corrected and allayed by a <hi>Meſſenger of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi>
ſent and <hi>given unto him to buffet him,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 7.</p>
                  <p>2. When men of learning and knowledge more than ordinary, ſhall
reflect upon their own worth in this kind, and hold intelligence with
their great parts and abilities (as the beſt of men, thus accompliſhed,
are apt to do, witneſs the great Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, who told the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> that <hi>though he was rude in ſpeech</hi> [meaning, as they thought,
and talked of him] <hi>yet not in KNOWLEDGE,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 6. See alſo
<hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 4.) eſpecially when they ſhall be conceited withal, that their
line of knowledge and underſtanding is raiſed higher, than really it is
(which is a weakneſſe frequently incident to the ſtrongeſt of this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration),
they are precipitately diſpoſed to <hi>preſume</hi> [as our former

The beſt Records of Antiquity, yea, the moſt un-queſtioned

Gold, or Precious Stones,</hi> upon the true foundation, but ſometimes, <hi>hey,

ſayings, and paſſages of ſtory, which look the ſame way. But my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
brevity forbids me to inſiſt upon Quotations, where they may be
omitted with as little damage to the cauſe in hand, as they may upon
the preſent occaſion: and as for thoſe, which the works and writings
of the Fathers afford upon the account, they have been already drawn
out, and preſented unto the world by others: Yea, who is there but

a truth in it worthy more conſideration, than is by many given to
it) is, <hi>Nullum est magnum ingenium ſine mixtura inſaniae,</hi> There is
no great wit, but hath a mixture [or allay] of madneſs in it. So that
men of great learning and parts are no infallible Oracles to conſult
about a dubious opinion, whether it be an error, or no.</p>
                  <p>3. The notion, conceit, or opinion of an <hi>Hyper-preſbyterian Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy,</hi>
is of ſuch a calculation, nature, and import, that without the
aſſiſtance of, or any monitory ſuggeſtion from Sathan, it is as apt to
breed, and to be ingendred, between a corrupt ambitious heart, and an
head rank of wit, and learning, as the Bull-ruſh is to grow out of the
mire. Some indeed have laid the miſchievous brat at Sathan's door,
confidently avouching him, by reaſon of the enormous, and even ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
antipathy in it unto God, and true Godlineſs, to be the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of it: But herein they rather flatter, than accuſe, or charge, that
unhappy parcel of fleſh and blood, which firſt gave warmth and forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
unto it in the womb of their brain. And whereas ſome, expert
in the Records of Antiquity, carry up the day of the dawning of it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Chriſtian world, to the year 140 after Chriſt, or thereabouts;
others, ſeeming as capable as they of the ſame pretenſion, bring it
down to about the year 300; the truth is, that though both theſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations
of the Nativity of it, eſpecially the former, give it the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and advantage of a long and ſpecious preſcription, yet the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching
complexion of it conſidered, together with the amorous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
towards ſuch objects, ſo frequently found in pregnant wits,
and large endowments, which are apt to afford men lively hopes of
enjoying them, it may rather ſeem ſtrange that it is not more ancient,
than either of the dates mentioned will allow it to be, and, in reſpect
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100311:34"/>
of time, nearer to ſome Apoſtolical Inſtitution. It ſeem's (indeed)
that even in the dayes of the Apoſtles, there was one (whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<hi>John</hi> call's, <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> Ep. 3. ver. 9.) that had an Epiſcopal Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo,
an unform'd conception of a Biſhoprick, in his heart; for he did
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, loved a Lordly Superiority over, or amongſt
his Chriſtian Brethren: but for want of an artificial <hi>Head</hi> (as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable)
to give unto this natural conception its ſpecifical and due form,
it proved an abortion, and like <hi>the untimely fruit of a woman, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſeeth the light of the Sun.</hi> It is no where found that <hi>Diotrephes</hi> ever
was a formal Biſhop, although he acted the part of a Biſhop in not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
the writings of an Apoſtle to take place againſt his own Intereſt,
in the Church, <hi>John</hi> Ep. 3. verſ. 9.</p>
                  <p>4. The notion of <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> (in the lofty ſenſe of the word) being
once ſtarted, though by one perſon only, in the Church, and brought
into conſideration and diſcourſe amongſt Chriſtians, it was eaſie to
propheſie,
<q>
                        <l>Plures annabunt thynni, &amp; cetaria creſcent:</l>
                        <l>More tunies will come ſwimming to the bait,</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>and that the generality of men, whoſe gifts and parts of learning, wit,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> were paramount to thoſe of the ordinary ſort of their Brethren,
underſtanding themſelves more capable, and likely than others, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
the Throne of this honour, in caſe it were once built, and well
ſetled in the Church, would be very diligent and ſtudious in finding
out all colourable and plauſible pretences to commend ſuch an office
unto the people, and to perſwade them that it would conduce much to
their Chriſtian welfare, if they did live under it, and ſubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
unto it. And though there have been many, both in ancient,
and later dayes, conſcientious and learned, that had not the mettal in
their foreheads (wherewith the Prelatical Advocates amongſt us, have,
more generally at leaſt, ſteeled theirs) to obtrude the Office we ſpeak
of, upon the world, under the high and indiſputable title of <hi>Jus Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num;</hi>
yet were they ſo far overcome with the enticing ſweetneſs of
the morſel, as to ſwallow it as lawful, though of humane preparation
and contrivance. Never did there a dead body, or carkaſs, falling on
the earth, by the ſcent and favour of it, more effectually draw the
Eagles together about it, than the pleaſant notion and conceit of the
Epiſcopal dignity, having once been named in the Chriſtian Church,
allure and engage many perſons of eminent gifts and abilities, age after
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100311:34"/>
age, in the maintenance, approbation, and commendation of it. They
are not like to <hi>ſpeak evil of dignities,</hi> who live in hope and expectation
of enjoying them themſelves. So that all circumſtances duely weighed,
the great multitude of learned Aſſertors of the cauſe of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> is but
a ſlender argument to prove, either the goodneſs, or lawfulneſs of it.

weighed in the ballance, I do not ſay of accurate reaſon, but of common

wherein that proud Lady, <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> with all her triobular accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trements,
is imbarqued; yea, and were it not for ſome poor relief,
ever and anon brought in from the ſhattered and ſophiſticated Records
of after ages, ſcarce one decree above ridiculous. I ſhall in few words,
give you a taſte, though not of the letter, or words, (this being a part
that cannot be acted, but on a larger Stage, than we are now upon) but
of the ſpirit, ſtrength, and ſubſtance, of ſome of their chief arguings
from the Scriptures; by which you may give a neer gueſs how little
their longſome diſſertations and diſcourſes upon the point ſignifie.
From <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 8, 11, &amp;c. they reaſon to no more purpoſe than thus:
<hi>Chriſt, when he aſcended up on high—gave gifts unto men: and he
gave ſome Apoſtles,—ſome, Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ergo</hi> he gave
ſome <hi>Dioceſan Biſhops.</hi> But if ſuch Biſhops as theſe were given by
Chriſt at his Aſcenſion, why ſhould the Apoſtle hide them, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or behind his <hi>Paſtors,</hi> as if he were aſhamed of them?
For the Great Officers we now ſpeak of, are at a great loſs amongſt
which of the Officers, expreſſely named by the Apoſtle, they ſhould
ſeek for their divine Inſtitution, or Donation by <hi>Chriſt</hi> unto the Church.
One while, when their courage is up, they claim high, and will needs
find their Inſtitution in, and together with, the Apoſtles, as their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors,
under whom their Succeſſors alſo (as they plead) who they
cannot (being ſo affectionately convinc'd through the in-evidence of

to be overcome of the tempting ſplendor of that new-diviſed worldly
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100311:36"/>
thing under an old ſpiritual name, commonly called <hi>Biſhoprick:</hi> So that
he alſo beareth witneſs, as well to the truth of the particular in hand
(acknowledging in effect, that the Scriptures are perverted and wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by thoſe who make them ſpeak, either for Biſhops, or Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops)

who are in a capacity of enjoying them, exceſſively in love with
them.</p>
                  <p>6. Nor hath it any thing of an argument in it worth the inſiſting
on, to prove the lawfulneſs of attending the Miniſtry of a Prelatical
Clergy, that the Profeſſors of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> have more generally atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſuch a Miniſtry ever ſince it had a being in the Church, which is
(in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> phraſe) time out of mind ten times over (as is on all
hands confeſſed). For,</p>
                  <p>1. It being the counſel of the will of God (as we gave knowledge
formerly) to ſuffer that plant of bitterneſs, <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> (in the Anti-Canonical
ſenſe of the word) not onely to be planted in the Soil of his
Church, but to take faſt root, to thrive and proſper, and ſpread her
branches far and neer, and bring forth fruit from many Ages, before
he intended the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that tearing of it up by the roots, (of which
our Saviour <hi>propheſieth</hi> as the common doom of all plants in the Church
which ſhould be planted by men, and not by his <hi>Heavenly Father,</hi>
Matth. 15. 13.) he judged it meet, and well comporting with that
his counſel, to ſuffer the generality of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Profeſſors, to be ſo far
deluded by the fair flouriſhes, and enticing pretences, of thoſe who
deſigned the ſetting up of the <hi>Epiſcopal Government</hi> over them, as to
yield their necks unto the yoke, and ſo to conform themſelves to all
the conſtitutions, and Magiſterial injunctions thereof in matters of
Religion. For unleſs the multitude of Profeſſors had been both at
firſt, and for many after Ages, ſo far bewitched, as willingly to bow
dow at the feet of this exotique Government, it could never have
taken that deep rooting in the world which now it hath done, nor
made ſo much work for the right hand of Heaven, to rid the world fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and fully of it, as now it is like to do. For though the compliance
of many Kings, and Princes, and Nobles, yea, and of many wiſe and
learned men, yea, and of ſome worthy and good men alſo, with it, were
neceſſary (as God eſteemeth things neceſſary in ſuch caſes) to make
the mountain of it ſo ſtrong, as (according to his permiſſive decree) it
hath been, for many ages by-paſt, in many parts of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:100311:36"/>
world, and is at this day in many, yet had not the generality, or main
body of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> people fallen in alſo, and made one and the ſame
ſhoulder with them to ſupport it, it had (in <hi>Davids</hi> compariſon) been
<hi>as graſs upon the houſe top, which withereth before it groweth up, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the mower filleth not his hand, nor be that bindeth ſheaves, his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</hi>
So that the general practice of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in receiving their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
food from a <hi>Prelatical</hi> Miniſtry, thought continued for many Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
yet the practiſers having all along ſuffered a ſpirit of ſlumber
to grow upon them, (for the tares were ſown, <hi>whileſt men ſlept,</hi> Matth.
13. 25.) and God not judging it meet to awaken them, their example
ſignifieth little as to the juſtification of the practiſe.</p>
                  <p>2. As the Apoſtle ſaith of the poor <hi>Gentiles, that they were carried
away to dumb idols, even as they were led,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 2. So (the truth
is) the common ſort of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> through an un-<hi>Chriſtian,</hi> yea, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
like, oſcitancy and ſupineſs of ſpirit, have been in all Ages (and
are at this day) exceeding apt to be carried away with Opinions and
Tenents, even as they were, and are, led by their Teachers. It is a
right ſaying of an Heathen, <hi>Omnes malumus credere; quam judicare:</hi>
There is ſcarce any of us all but naturally had rather, even in matters
of a moral) and much more, in things of a ſpiritual, and religious) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment,

So then the Spiritual Guides and Teachers of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> people having
been (for may Generations) Miniſters made ſuch with <hi>Prelatical
hands,</hi> and juſtifying this Miniſtry before their people, as legitimate
and approved of God, both by their accepting it, and by their acting
in the vertue, and by the authority of it, (beſides all occaſional plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
for it otherwiſe) it is but matter of courſe (as it were) that their
people ſhould ſwallow it, and make no queſtion about it for conſcience
ſake.</p>
                  <p>3. The peoples attendance upon an Epiſcopal Miniſtry anciently,
and near unto the times when <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> was firſt conceived, and
brought forth in the Chriſtian Church, was nothing ſo broadly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100311:37"/>
with the Rule of the Goſpel, as now it is, but by many degrees
more tollerable, and defenſible, than that attendance upon a Miniſtry
of the ſame denomination, which is in theſe dayes exhibited unto it.
The Biſhop that now is, (I mean, that is now commonly ſo called) is
another kind of creature, ſpecifically diſtinct from thoſe that were ſo
called, about the times when the Name (in the high ſignification of
the word) was firſt heard in the <hi>Christian</hi> world: For if the beſt
Records of Antiquity ſignifie any thing, the Biſhops we ſpeak of, at, and
ſome while after their firſt Original, were choſen by the people, who
were to live under their inſpection and Government, in conjunction
with their Miniſters. So that thoſe Miniſters, who were made after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by theſe Biſhops, were, in a ſence <hi>(viz.</hi> mediately, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely)
made by themſelves (I mean by the people themſelves) in and
by that act of theirs, whereby they cloſe their Biſhops, and gave them
power (I do not mean, a lawful power, for ſuch was not in them to
give) to ordain Miniſters for them. Now then if they did attend upon
Miniſters Epiſcopally ordained, upon the tearm ſpecified, their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
no wayes paralel's, no wayes countenceth, much leſſe juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
the practiſe of any in theſe dayes, who from time to time ſit under
a Prelatical Miniſtry; conſidering that the Biſhops, which the world
now affordeth, are of a quite different extraction from thoſe in anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
times, far more ſpurious and degenerate, the people of God being
ſo far from chuſing, or defiring them, that they make their way by an
high hand to make themſelves Lords over them.</p>
                  <p>7. (and laſtly, for this) As for thoſe, who have dealt ſo effectually
with their judgements and conſciences, as to make themſelves both
able and willing, to conceive, that there can be no lawful Miniſtry, but
that which ſprings from under a pair of Epiſcopal hands; the conceit
is ſo prodigiouſly importune and unreaſonable, that to engage in any
ſolemn or ſerious oppoſition to it, may ſeem to be a work proper onely
for him that hath little elſe to do. Nevertheleſs, becauſe I find that
there are not wanting amongſt us, who have ſuffered themſelves to be
baptized in the ſpirit of this conceit, (to the diſparagement of their
judgments, to the enſnaring of their conſciences, and who knowes to
what publique inconvenience beſides?) to ſet them at liberty from
the bands of this inchantment, I maſt heartily and ſeriouſly recommend
unto them the diligent peruſal of that elaborate and learned Diſcourſe
of Mr. <hi>W. Prynne</hi> lately mentioned, once and again) publiſhed the

great aptneſs in profeſſors of the Goſpel to ſtumble at this ſtone, and
to think they may lawfully do many things under the covert of their
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> liberty, at which otherwiſe their Conſciences would boggle,

higher, and more awful, and ſacred terms, than otherwiſe we had
been; yea, and upon the ſame terms, to refrain and forbear all
things, though otherwiſe lawful (if they be not neceſſary alſo) which
are contrary unto, either the one, or the other. This is the plain and
unqueſtionable Doctrine of the Scriptures, and is accordingly taught

it be objected, that we are not bound by any rule of charity, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
our ſpiritual food, for the offence of any, as we are our temporal;
I anſwer, yes: in the like ſenſe, and reſpect, in which we are bound in
charity towards a weak Brother, to forbear temporal meat, we ſtand
bound to forbear ſpiritual alſo. If a Brother were ſo weak, as to be
offended that I ſhould eat any meat whatſoever in caſe of the utmoſt
neceſſity for the ſupport of my life, when I cannot come at any other,
in this caſe I were not to regard his being offended, but to eat the meat
which God hath given me to releive me in my extremity, howſoever:
The reaſon is, becauſe in ſuch a caſe I ſtand bound in duty towards
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100311:38"/>
God to preſerve my life, which I cannot do in any other way, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by eating ſuch meat, my eating of which may (as the caſe ſuppoſeth)
offend my Brother. But when I may relieve my hunger, and ſuſtain
my life, by ſeveral kinds of meat, one of which my Brother judgeth it
not lawful for me to eat, but taketh no offence at my eating any of the
other, if in this caſe I ſhould eat that which offendeth him, I ſhould
not (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>walk charitably towards him:</hi> but <hi>deſtroy</hi> him,
and ſo abuſe my <hi>Chriſtian</hi> liberty, and ſin againſt <hi>Chriſt.</hi> There is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
the ſame conſideration in chuſing our ſpiritual nouriſhment,
and means of edification. Suppoſe we judge that we may, yea, and that
we do edifie by reſorting to a <hi>Prelatical</hi> Miniſtry (about which we ſhall
notwithſtanding a little demur before the cloſe of this anſwer) yet
knowing that our reſorting hither, is an offence and ſcandal to many
good <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> though weak, God having afforded us great variety
otherwiſe of worthy means for our Edification (as hath been proved
formerly)<note n="a" place="margin">Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion 19.</note> ſuch a practiſe (were it in it ſelf lawful, yet) being
againſt charity, is an abuſe of our <hi>Chriſtian</hi> liberty, a kind of wanton
and contemptuous trampling upon the peace and comfort of our weak
Brethren (who may be as precious in the ſight of God as our ſelves,
notwithſtanding their weakneſſe) and conſequently, muſt needs be a
ſin highly provoking the Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Indeed if God had commanded
us to hearken unto this Generation of Miniſters, what means ſoever
beſides he ſhould vouchſafe unto us for our edification, or ſhould have
threatned us with the vengeance of eternal Fire, if we did not hear
them, in this caſe ſhould any perſon be offended at us for hearing
them, he muſt bear the burthen of his offence himſelf for we ſhould be
innocent) but if under the circumſtance mentioned, we ſhall comport,
in our attention with them, &amp; a weak Brother ſhall be offended at our
comportance in this kind; God will require his offence at our hand.
An offence may be taken at the performance of a duty; but cannot
be given but by an act of liberty.</p>
                  <p>Again, The miſdemeanor of offending a weak Brother by receiving
our ſpiritual meat from the hand of a Prelatical Servitor, is in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
more ſinful, than to offend him in eating any material meat
would be, namely, that the offence given in the former caſe, is by an
action or practice that is in it ſelf, and out of the caſe of ſcandal, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
(as hath been proved at large) whereas in the latter caſe, the
offence is given by an action, which ſimply, and in it ſelf conſidered,
is lawful: <hi>For every creature of God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of
material meat) <hi>is good, and nothing to be refuſed,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Tim. 4. 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:100311:39"/>
3. It hath been proved in the preceding <hi>Conſiderations,</hi> that the
frequent recourſe of Godly perſons to <hi>Prelatical</hi> Miniſters in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
exerciſe of their Miniſtry, is, in ſeveral other reſpects, beſides
that of ſcandal and offence given unto weak <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> a manifeſt
breach of the Law of Chrity; As 1. Becauſe it encourageth ſuch
Miniſters in an evil way, and hideth Repentance from their eyes;
whereas their withdrawing from them, is a proper means to make them
better acquainted with themſelves, and to help them to be aſhamed
of their <hi>Babylonian</hi> preferment. 2. Becauſe by countenancing and
ſtrengthning the hand of theſe men in their way, they help to harden
the hearts of their great Lords and Maſters alſo in the evil of their
way, which is more provoking in the ſight of God than the other.
3. Becauſe by honouring the Miniſters of the Prelatical Creation, with
their dependance on them for the words of eternal life, and high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments
of ſalvation, they keep up and ſtrengthen the Intereſt of the
<hi>Prelates</hi> in the hearts and minds of the people, and ſo make the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of their power the more ſtrong and durable; and conſequently,
bring upon their own heads the guilt of being acceſſary to all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages
of perſecution and cruelty, wherein this generation of men ſhall
magnifie themſelves againſt the Saints of the Moſt High. 4. Becauſe
by accepting of Miniſters of an Epiſcopal recommendation and inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiture,
they wrong and weaken the right-veſted by <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Churches, for the choice and ordination of their reſpective Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.
Theſe particulars we argued more at large, and brought the
truth of them into a clear light in the foregoing <hi>Conſiderations:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we only mention them here. The Reader may pleaſe to review
<hi>Conſideration</hi> 2, 3, 4- 13, 14, 15. So that the liberty purchaſed for the
Saints by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is ſo far from being a reaſonable ground whereon to
juſtifie or warrant the practice condemned in theſe papers, that it is
a moſt ſovereign diſſwaſive and retractive from it: For the greater
love <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath any wayes manifeſted unto them, he hath laid ſo much
the greater and ſtronger engagements upon them to love others, and
more eſpecially thoſe of the houſhold of Faith; and conſequently, to
refrain all wayes and doings that are inconſiſtent with this affection
towards the one or the other.</p>
                  <p>4. (and laſtly) The liberty purchaſed for the Saints by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was
intended by him only for their comfort, welfare and peace, not for
their prejudice or loſs: Therefore any man to plead this liberty to
embolden himſelf unto any ſuch practice, whereby he is likely, or
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100311:39"/>
rather cannot but prejudice and endammage himſelf, and this in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of greateſt concernment unto him, muſt needs be an abuſe of this
liberty. Now that for the Servants of God to attend upon, or (which
is the ſame) to hold Communion with ſuch a Miniſtry which is no
where approved, or ſanctified by <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his Word, but obtruded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> with an high hand, by thoſe who are confederate both in
ſpirit &amp; practice, with <hi>the Scarlet Whore ſitting upon the Scarlet-coloured
Beaſt, and drunken with the Blood of the Saints</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Rev. 17. 3, 6.</note> (a deſcription which
belyeth not the Prelatical Prieſthood, or Miniſtry) muſt needs have
a direct and ſtrong tendency to their real loſs and detriment, may be
thus brought out of darkneſs into light. The great jealouſie and fierce
wrath of God are again and again reveated from Heaven, not only
againſt the Antichriſtian <hi>Beaſt</hi> himſelf, that had <hi>two Horns like a Lamb,
yet Spake as a Dragon</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Rev. 13. 11.</note> &amp;c. but alſo againſt all his complices and

If any man worſhip the Beaſt and his Image, and receive his mark in his

of mercy or compaſſion] <hi>into the cup of his indignation, and he ſhall be
tormented with Fire and Brimſtone, in the preſence of the holy Angels, and
in the preſence of the Lamb: And the ſmoak of their torment aſcendeth
up for ever. And they have no reſt day nor night who worſhip the Beaſt and

dreadful denunciation and warning! enough to make both the ears of
him that ſhall hear it, to tingle; and to prevail with any man that
loves not the vengeance of hell fire, or to have God his Enemy in the
fierceſt of his Indignation, to keep off, at leaſt, <hi>the thouſand ſix
hundred furlongs diſtance,</hi> ſpoken of <hi>(Rev.</hi> 14. 20.) from all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the <hi>Beaſt, Babylon,</hi> the <hi>Falſe Prophet,</hi> and <hi>Scarlet Whore,</hi>
in all their lewd and deteſtable doings. And whereas ſeveral other
things of moment might be obſerved from the paſſages now cited,
I ſhall at preſent) take notice of theſe two only. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the
moſt ſevere and dreadful vengeance here deſcribed, is not threatned
againſt any inward defection, or leaning in heart, mind or judgement,
towards the wayes and practices of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> but againſt any outward
compliance with him, as in the <hi>receiving his mark in the forehead, or
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100311:40"/>
in the right hand,</hi> &amp;c. So that it is in vain for men to plead the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
and goodneſs of their heart, if in their outward man they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to any of his abominations. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Holy Ghoſt
expreſſeth thoſe compliances, or thoſe acts of compliance, with the
Beaſt, againſt which the moſt heavy doom deſcribed is threatned, in
words and phraſes that are obſcure and of difficult interpretation
(as the <hi>worſhipping of the Beaſt and his Image, the receiving his Mark
in the Forehead, or in the right Hand)</hi> that ſo the Saints might be made
jealous and fearful, not only of ſuch actions und wayes wherein they
ſhould broadly and right-down ſymbolize, and comport with him,
but even of thoſe alſo, which have the leaſt and lighteſt appearance
of ſuch a comportment. Men uſe to be more circumſpect in their
way, and more careful of keeping themſelves at a ſufficient diſtance
from Ditches, Precipices, and places of danger, when they walk in the
twilight, the light of the Sun is apt to make them more bold and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous.
And it is the expreſs will of God concerning us, that we

                     <note n="a" place="margin">1 Theſſ. 5. 22.</note> likewiſe, yea, and from whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

Sphere than they; a power (I mean) of impoſing upon men what

emphatically, and <gap reason="foreign">

reſpect, may (with too good propriety of ſpeech) be termed <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian,</hi>
or <hi>Antichriſts</hi> of an inferiour order. But this by the way.
From the late premiſes it plainly enough appeareth, that the lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our ears and underſtandings, from time to time, to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
of a ſpurious and earthly deſcent, and which the Prelates
(rank of the ſpirit that breatheth in <hi>Antichriſt</hi> the Great) may
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100311:41"/>
truly call theirs, is a conſtructive juſtification of this <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and
that in his fundamental wickedneſs (as was even now hinted) and
ſo expoſeth us unto danger of partaking with him in his plagues:
and therefore cannot be encouraged, or led unto it by the ſweet <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
of the liberty purchaſed for us by Chriſt; this (as hath been
ſhewed) moſt effectually diſſwading and drawing us aſide from all
actions and wayes, that are of any threatning or dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
unto us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Whereas the <hi>Argument</hi> pleadeth that the benefit of
Edification may lawfully be ſought after, and received, from any
Miniſtry whatſoever, not only in the Reformed Churches, but even
among <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves, as from <hi>Jeſuites, Fryars, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer;</p>
                  <p>1. That evil ought not to be done, for the compaſſing or obtaining
of any good whatſoever. The great Apoſtle being reported to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the contrary, rejects the report with great indignation, as an
unworthy ſlander, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 8. And no marvel; it being repugnant
even to the Light of Nature (as might be ſhewed from the Sayings
of ſome of her Prophets) that the attainment of that which is good,
ſhould be endeavoured by unlawful wayes: The reaſon whereof
might be inſiſted on, but that we are in haſt. Now it bath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
argued, and proved, by <hi>Conſiderations</hi> not a few, That to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
upon any Miniſtry, which is of an Apocryphal and ſinful erecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and conſequently derogatory unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his care and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
over the Houſe of God, whatſoever our ends or expectations
may be, in, or from ſuch our attendance, is unlawful, and diſpleaſing
unto God, and more eſpecially, and unqueſtionably, in the caſe of
Scandal given to weak Chriſtians. No goodneſs of ends or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
will make atonement for a ſinful action.</p>
                  <p>2. Though Edification be more neceſſary, and of greater concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be endeavoured and ſought after by a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> than his daily
bread, yet God having provided orderly and regular means, and theſe
every way ſufficient for his obtaining it, (as hath been with greateſt
evidence proved from the Scriptures<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>See</hi> Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration 19.</note>) he is not to pleaſe himſelf
with breaking the Divine appointment on this behalf, or to be his own
Carver, when God hath ſet out a meet and full allowance for him;
no whit more, than with ſeeking his daily bread by indirect and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
practices, when as there are honeſt wayes and means to
ſupply him in this kind, which have the bleſſing of God annexed by
promiſe unto them, and he well capable of the uſe of them. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt chargeth it upon the Saints as a ſpecial duty and ſervice for
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100311:41"/>
the honour of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that they obſerve a <hi>Decorum,</hi> and comely Order
in their Church Aſſemblies, and in managing the Ordinances and holy
Inſtitutions of God. <hi>Let all things be done decently, and in order</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 40.</note>.
And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſignifies to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> that he <hi>rejoyced,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding,
though onely <hi>in ſpirit,</hi> (for he was now abſent in body) <hi>their

or (as the word ſignifieth) to ſet matters at rights, in the Churches
there<note n="d" place="margin">Tit. 1. 5</note>. Now as it is a manifeſt breach of order, when a wife is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
to her own husband, her obedience unto him being <hi>fit and

Not to make rents or <hi>Diviſions</hi> in their body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10. or to <hi>cauſe
offences,</hi> Rom. 16. 17. (with ſeveral other things of like import with
theſe) it is (I ſay) diſorderly in the higheſt for any Member being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſuch ſacred obligations as theſe, unto his body, or fellow-members,
to turn his back upon them, to abandon their communion, to forſake
their holy Aſſemblies, and under a pretence of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> liberty to
ſeek after edification, to betake himſelf from time to time unto ſtrange
Teachers (eſpecially being of an infamous and polluted Order) and to
frequent Congregations of a Politique Conſtitution, and worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
in the name of Churches of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Now for any man to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
edification by violating the Order, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath eſtabliſhed
in his Churches, is with as little reaſon, as to expect to <hi>gather grapes

                  <p>3. (and laſtly, for this) Were it granted, or ſuppoſed, that a perſon
might gather as much, yea, or more, knowledge in the Miſteries of the
Goſpel, from the lips of ſtrange Teachers in their Miniſtry, than he
was like to do by the teachings in his own Church, and amongſt thoſe,
from whom he hath ſperated himſelf; yet neither will this prove that
he <hi>edifieth,</hi> as much, or more, as, or than, he might have done, by
waiting upon God at the door of the lips of him, or them, who ſpeak
from God, in his own Congregation. The Silver, and Gold, which an
ungodly man poſſeſſeth, may be of the ſame kind of mettal, and of the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100311:42"/>
ſame allay, and refining, with that, which is poſſeſſed by one that is
righteous: yet the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, that <hi>a little that a righteous
man hath, is better</hi> [that is, is ſerviceable to the owner upon a better
account] <hi>than the riches of many wicked</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 37. 16.</note>. The reaſon is, or may be,
becauſe the <hi>righteous mans little,</hi> being honeſtly gotten, or obtained,
hath the bleſſing of God upon it, and is ſanctified unto him: Whereas
the riches of wicked men, being either unjuſtly obtained, or unconſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably
detained and kept up, or both, are polluted unto the owners,
and have the curſe of God cleaving to them, according as he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
Mal. 2. 2. <hi>I will curſe your bleſſings.</hi> In like manner, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
in things appertaining unto God, and relating unto the ſaving of
the ſoul, which is obtained by breach of Goſpel-order, and by attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon a Miniſtry of an unclean Parentage and deſcent, may, in the
letter and notion of it, be altogether the ſame (yea and poſſibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
it) with that, which is gained by keeping cloſe to God in his
Goſpel-Inſtitutions &amp; Appointments, and received from thoſe Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
which the Holy Ghoſt hath ſet over us, or is diſpenſed in our
own <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Aſſemblies; and yet come far ſhort of it in the matter
of true Edification [I mean, in building men up in Faith and true
holineſs.] For there is an aptneſs in knowledge, in conjunction with
the weakneſs and vanity of the heart of man, to <hi>puff</hi> men <hi>up</hi> (as the
Apoſtle ſpeaketh) which is as contrary to Edification, as contrary may
be, unleſs the flatulency and windineſs of it be corrected by the Grace
and Bleſſing of God. Beſides, the Scripture in many known places,
informeth us, that knowledge and ungodlineſs agree too well together
(many times) in the ſame ſubject and ſoul. Now though God may (as
hath been argued, and granted, formerly) ſometimes countenance and
bleſs a Miniſtry of a forreign plantation, to the converſion of ſome, and
edification of others [namely when, and whilſt, the irregularity and
unlawfueſs of it remains un-diſcovered, ſo that people in the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of their hearts reſort unto it, and whilſt other means of Grace
are ſcant, and Goſpel Churches few, and remote] yet there is little
queſtion to be made but that he much more rejoyceth over a Miniſtry
of his own contrivance and eſtabliſhment, to work gracious and great
things by it for the precious ſouls of men. And Miniſters, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their Commiſſion for their work from him, or in his way, are oft
found <hi>Miniſters of the Spirit,</hi> when as thoſe of an exotique and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
protruſion, though of greater gifts, and parts of learning, prove (in
compariſon) <hi>Miniſters</hi> onely <hi>of the Letter.</hi> Therefore they that go
wondring, or wandring, after ſuch Teachers as theſe, upon a deſign or
deſire of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> edification, expoſe themſelves by a like courſe, unto
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100311:42"/>
a like curſe or diſappointment, with thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> of old, concerning
whom the Prophet ſaid, <hi>They ſhall commit adultery</hi> [that is, they ſhall
take unto them many wives] <hi>and ſhall not increaſe</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Hoſen 4. 10.</note> And as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
of <hi>Daniel</hi> and his three Companions, who refuſed to <hi>defile
themſelves with the portion of the Kings meat, or with the wine which he
drank,</hi> chuſing rather to <hi>eat pulſe, and to drink water;</hi> that <hi>their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
appeared fairer, and fatter in fleſh, then all the children that did
eat the portion of the Kings meat</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Dan. 1 8, 12, 13</note>: In like manner they, who out of
Conſcience, ſhal content themſelves with that ſpiritual diet, though it
ſeems but ſpare and thin, which God judgeth meet to provide for them,
are like to thrive better in the inner man, and to grow faſter in Grace,
than thoſe Teachers, by whom the ſouls of the Princes, and Great
men of the Earth delight to be ſerved. So the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
being diſſatisfied with <hi>Manna</hi> (which yet was Angels bread
<note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 98 25</note>) villifying it as <hi>a light bread</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="margin">Numb 21. 5</note>, and complaining, that <hi>their ſoul
was dryed away</hi> for want of better nouriſhment<note n="e" place="margin">Numb 11. 6.</note>, fell a luſting after
fleſh: wherewith though God was greatly provoked, yet <hi>they were
not diſappointed of their luſt</hi>
                     <note n="f" place="margin">Pſa. 78 30</note>, fleſh was given them in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<note n="g" place="margin">Numb 11. 31.</note>: But <hi>while the fleſh was yet between their teeth, the wrath of
the Lord was kindled againſt them, and the Lord ſmote them with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great plague</hi>
                     <note n="h" place="margin">Numb 11. 33.</note>. And it is greatly to be feared, that ſuch
Members of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Congregations, who kick againſt the ſpiritual
proviſions in thoſe Houſes of God, to which they relate, as if there
were neither marrow, nor fatneſs, nor any good nouriſhment in them,
and think to feaſt ſumpiuouſly with the World in their Synagogues,
and Aſſemblies; greatly (I ſay) it is to be feared, that the ſweet
morſels they ſhall eat here, will never digeſt kindly with them, nor
breed any good blood, but turn to wind and water, and bring the
diſpleaſure of God upon them. Therefore if <hi>Edification</hi> be the end
which men propoſe unto themſelves in taking a liberty to travel to
drink of the waters of <hi>Abanah</hi> and <hi>Pharpar,</hi> they might with much
more wiſdom, and likelihood of ſucceſs, have conſulted the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their deſire in this kind, by ſtaying at home, and contenting
themſelves with the ſtreams of <hi>Jordan.</hi>

               <head>Argument VII.</head>
               <p>Laſtly, Some conceive they may lawfully hear thoſe Miniſters
whom theſe Papers all along have endeavoured to perſwade all good
men to decline and turn away from, if they hear them onely as men
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100311:43"/>
well furniſhed by God with gifts and abilities for the preaching of the
Goſpel, and ſhall not at all mind, or regard, their Ordination;
neither whence it comes, nor whither it goes, nor by what, or
whoſe, Authority they ſtand forth to preach. For that it is lawful
to hear any man preach the Goſpel, even without any Ordination by
men at all, if we perceive, or underſtand, him competently qualified
for the work, is more generally, if not univerſally, acknowledged by
knowing and underſtanding men.</p>
               <div type="answer">
                  <head>Anſwer.</head>
                  <p>1. There is little queſtion to be made but that it may be lawful to
hear, yea oft, and from time to time, to hear ſuch a man preach, or
declare in words, and in a continued diſcourſe (for this I call preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
the counſel and mind of God in the Goſpel, who never received
Ordination (in the common, and beſt known Notion of the word)
from men; yet under theſe Conditions, or Proviſo's.</p>
                  <p>1. That he pretends not to an Ordination, having never received
any, true, or falſe, and the falſhood of his pretence, or his lye in this
caſe, is either known to us, or juſtly ſuſpected. It is not worthy a
<hi>Chriſtian,</hi> to countenance a liar, or a perſon juſtly ſuſpected for ſuch,
in ſo ſacred a work, as the diſpenſing the Oracles of God.</p>
                  <p>2. That he hath not ſubmitted to any Mock Ordination, or ſuch
which is irregular (in the principal, or main of it) for ſuch an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
is a meer nullity (as was ſhewed ſoon after the beginning
of this Diſcourſe) in which reſpect, he that walketh under it, may
well be taken for a Non-Ordained man. Yet ſuch a man is not to
be countenanced, or honoured, with the preſence of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> when
he preſumes (not having firſt, by one means or other, teſtified his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
for ſuch a miſcarriage) to miniſter the Glorious Goſpel of
<hi>Chriſt.</hi> For it is not meet that the ſheep of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould give ear
to ſuch a Shepherd, who <hi>entreth not by the door</hi> (that is, by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and
according to his appointment) <hi>into the</hi> Sheep-fold, <hi>but climbeth up
another way,</hi> Joh. 10. 1, 5. compared. But this is the main part
argued hitherto.</p>
                  <p>3. That we find him to be, in ſome degree at leaſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
by God to teach: which requireth, 1. Some good acquaintance
in the Maſter Veins of the body of the Goſpel: And 2. A convenient
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100311:43"/>
utterance, ſo as to be able to communicate the conceptions of his
mind, unto the minds and underſtandings of thoſe that hear him.
To encourage any private Chriſtian to the exerciſe of Propheſying,
in any more publick way than amongſt thoſe of his own family, whom
God hath not recommended unto his Brethren, by the common Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of both theſe Gifts unto him, eſpecially the former, in ſome
conſiderable proportion above the generality of his fellows, tendeth
rather to the diſhonour of the Goſpel, and to the diſparagement of
him that is encouraged upon ſuch terms, than otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>4. That he be a perſon of a modeſt, humble, ſober, and grave ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
of an inoffenſive and exemplary behaviour, not under any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
or reproach for any thing ſcandalous or unchriſtian, in
his courſe. If they ſhall undertake to preach <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
unto him, (as all thoſe are who obey not his Goſpel, or will
not ſuffer him to reign over them, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 27.) they are not to be
honoured or encouraged in ſuch their undertaking, by thoſe who
are his friends.</p>
                  <p>5. (and Laſtly) That whilſt we honour a private Chriſtian in his
exerciſe of thoſe good Gifts, which God hath given him for our Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
and Comfort, we do not prejudice (in the leaſt) that greater
and more ſolemn Ordinance of the Miniſtry, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath given
as a ſingular bleſſing unto his Churches; nor any wayes diſcourage
or grieve thoſe, who are over us in the Lord, and muſt give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for our ſouls. The Ordinances of Chriſt are all neceſſary in
their (reſpective) ſeaſons, and amicably affected towards one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
there is imployment enough, and this honourable, for them
all; ſo that one needs not endamage or entrench upon the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of another. Theſe Cautions and Conditions obſerved, there
is little queſtion but that it is very lawful to attend upon the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exerciſes
of a private perſon, or a man nor ordained (in the common
ſenſe of the word) for the Work of the Miniſtry, or of Preaching:
Yet this proveth not (as was even now briefly ſhewed) that it is in
like manner lawful to hear he preachings of a perſon, who hath ſo
far neglected the honour and pleaſure of his great Lord and Maſter
<hi>CHRIST,</hi> as to purchaſe leave and liberty, to preach the Goſpel,
of thoſe who have neither power to grant, nor power to deny, and
leaſt of all, power to ſell, any ſuch thing, but are intruders upon,
and uſurpers, yea, and prophaners of the holy Priviledges both of
Chriſt and his People.</p>

2. If it be unlawful to hear ſuch Miniſters as theſe, as, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are Prelatically Ordained, it cannot be lawful to hear
them as gifted men, or as perſons well qualified, in reſpect of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and utterance, to preach the Goſpel. For it is a general and
true Rule, That no particular or individual action, which is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in reſpect of any one circumſtance, can be made lawful by the
innocency of never ſo many circumſtances otherwiſe. Nor is there
any particular action ſo broadly unlawful, but hath ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
(haply, many) lawful enough relating to it, according to the
ſaying, <hi>Malum ſemper habitat in alieno fundo,</hi> Evil alwayes dwells
in a ſoyl that is none of its own; meaning, that it ſtill cleaveth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſomewhat that is (naturally) good.</p>
                  <p>3. (And laſtly,) In caſe he that thinketh it lawful to hear the
Miniſters we ſpeak of, as men well accompliſhed with Gifts for the
work of Preaching, though not as men ſinfully ordained, ſhould
openly and publickly declare and profeſs, that he heareth them
only in the former conſideration, and at no hand in the latter, his
act in hearing them (I conceive) would be much more excuſable,
both with God and good men; but whether it would be wholly ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
hereby, I ſomewhat doubt. If a man ſhould bow down to,
or before an Image, although he ſhould never ſo ſeriouſly proteſt
and ſay, that he boweth not down to it, or before it, as it is ſilver,
gold, wood, ſtone, or the like, nor as it is the workmanſhip of mens
hands, but only as it putteth him in mind of God; I believe this
would not make him innocent of the great offence of violating the
ſecond Commandment, where bowing down to an Image is expreſly
forbidden: for no conſideration put by man upon ſuch an action,
which is a direct breach of any Commandment of God, can alter
the property of it, or cauſe it to be no ſuch breach. Therefore if
it be againſt the mind of God, that we ſhould with our preſence ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
the Teachings of ſuch Miniſters, who come in this Name unto
us, from under <hi>Prelatical</hi> hands, it is not our conſidering them as
perſons gifted for the Miniſtry, when we do thus honour them, that
will reconcile our acting in this kind with the mind, or will of God;
how much leſs, if we ſhall keep this our conſideration to our ſelves,
and within our own breaſts? For in this caſe, how ſhall our weak
brother, who is offended at our hearing ſuch Miniſters, come to
know, but that we hear them upon the worſt, and moſt offenſive
terms of all, namely, as Preaching by vertue of their Epiſcopal
Ordination, and ſo be offended much more? Again, How ſhall
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100311:44"/>
the Miniſters themſelves whom we hear, not think but that we
hear them as Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> rightly Ordained, and ſo be
ſtrengthened or hardened in the evil of their way, upon a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
of our concurrence in Judgement with them, touching their
Ordination, and the goodneſs of the Way by which they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into the Miniſtry, if we hear them from time to time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
declaring or proteſting againſt their Ordination? So that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they be, that judge it unlawful to hear them as <hi>Prelatical Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi>
have no reaſonable ground to think that they may notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
lawfully hear them as <hi>gifted men,</hi> unleſs they ſhall make
their tongues the Interpreters of their minds and intentions in the
caſe. Neither dare I warrant them that the loudeſt declaring of
themſelves in this kind, will warrant their practice in hearing
them: But I really believe, that they will find it much cheaper of
the two, and every way more commodious for them, wholly to
wave the hearing of the men they wot of, than to make any ſuch
Declaration.</p>
