            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

by being <hi>printed,</hi> above that which they

            <p>Vpon these considerations <hi>(worthy

following Discourse might (by the
<hi>Printers</hi> help) become <hi>legible,</hi> and
though I am very conscious of its ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
<hi>defects,</hi> upon the same reason I
have fulfilled your desire.</p>
            <p>It were too great <hi>pity,</hi> if such a rare
and precious <hi>Jewel</hi> as he was should
have been lockt up in a <hi>Cabinet;</hi> yea,
<hi>pity</hi> it is, that a more skilful <hi>Lapida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>

him forth in his <hi>lustre.</hi> But the <hi>best</hi>
of it is, his <hi>native</hi> lustre was such as
needed not the help of <hi>Art;</hi> and so far
is this Discourse from <hi>adding</hi> to his
<hi>splendour,</hi> that in truth it <hi>receiveth</hi>
whatever <hi>worth</hi> it hath from him.</p>
            <p>Such as it is, I tender to you by this
<hi>Dedication,</hi> and justly, since you have
the greatest <hi>right</hi> to it, as being an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory</hi>
of your Dear <hi>Fathers</hi> best
<hi>goods,</hi> and choicest <hi>riches,</hi> which he

            <p>An <hi>Inventory</hi> I call it, and that such
as I dare <hi>own</hi> to be so far <hi>true,</hi> that
there is nothing <hi>said of him</hi> which doth
<pb facs="tcp:48444:4"/>
not <hi>belong to him;</hi> and therefore let
none think that I do <hi>nimis adulari,</hi> at
all <hi>flatter</hi> him, though on the other hand
I ingeniously acknowledg it is <hi>far short</hi>
of what might have been <hi>said of him:</hi>
and therefore your self with the rest of
his relations may think that I did <hi>fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gide

               <hi>There are

say, the several <hi>Passages</hi> of his <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi>

And now <hi>(Honoured Sir)</hi> though
it grieve you to have <hi>lost,</hi> it is no small

nor will, I hope, the <hi>reading afresh</hi>
what you have <hi>heard before,</hi> discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
you, since you will finde more <hi>white</hi>
of your deceased Fathers <hi>gracious life,</hi>
than will <hi>checker</hi> the <hi>black</hi> of his <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous

but an <hi>honour,</hi> a <hi>great</hi> honour
to you to have had <hi>such</hi> a <hi>Father,</hi>
who was <hi>greatly</hi> and <hi>highly</hi> (yet
no more than <hi>deservedly)</hi> belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and honoured, both <hi>living</hi> and
<hi>Dead</hi> in City and Country. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
give me leave to mind you, that the

a strong <hi>obligation</hi> of <hi>duty</hi> to <hi>walk</hi> in
his <hi>steps</hi> and conform to his <hi>Patern,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48444:5"/>
which I trust, in some measure you <hi>do,</hi>
and will do more and <hi>more.</hi> May you
(if it be God's will) equalize his <hi>years,</hi>
and as you <hi>grow</hi> in <hi>years, grow</hi> in
<hi>grace,</hi> that you may if not <hi>equalize,</hi> yet
<hi>come near</hi> to his <hi>righteous Patern.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>I doubt not but whilst he was on earth,
he put up many</hi> devout Prayers <hi>for
you, your</hi> Consort, <hi>your</hi> Posterity, <hi>and
not for you only but your</hi> sisters <hi>with

            <p>And before I proceed further, it will not be amiss

It had been sufficient as to the <hi>scope</hi> of

fell asleep, saw Corruption.</hi> But he being an <hi>eminent</hi>
person not only in place but grace must not be <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned</hi>
without an <hi>honorable</hi> character, nay though

            </p>
            <p>But I rather adhere to that <hi>Exposition</hi> which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the <hi>Will of God's Decree,</hi> referrs it to <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
and giveth this <hi>sense,</hi> that <hi>David served that
generation</hi> upon which he was <hi>cast by the Will of
God:</hi> According to which <hi>construction</hi> here is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<hi>implied</hi> and something <hi>express'd</hi> in this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:48444:7"/>
1. That which is <hi>implied</hi> is, that that <hi>generation</hi>
in which every man liveth, is, <hi>allotted</hi> to him by the
<hi>Will</hi> and counsel of <hi>God.</hi> We come not into this
<hi>world</hi> by <hi>chance</hi> but <hi>Providence,</hi> and that we are <hi>born</hi>
in this or that <hi>place,</hi> in this or that <hi>age,</hi> is the wise
<hi>appointment</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 17. 27.</note> according to that of St. <hi>Paul, he
hath made of one blood all Nations to dwell upon the
face of the earth, and hath determined the times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
appointed, and the bounds of their habitation.</hi>
And therefore, if the <hi>Generation</hi> in which we live be
<hi>virtuous</hi> and <hi>prosperous,</hi> we must <hi>thankfully</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
the <hi>goodness</hi> of <hi>Divine</hi> dispensation; and if it
be <hi>vitious</hi> and <hi>calamitous,</hi> the <hi>daies</hi> and times <hi>evil,</hi>
we must not <hi>repine</hi> nor <hi>murmur,</hi> because it is no other
than <hi>Divine</hi> determination which hath cast us upon
the one or the other.</p>
            <p>2. But secondly, That which is <hi>expressed</hi> is, that
it is our <hi>Duty,</hi> whilst we live in this world to <hi>serve
our generation.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cic.</note> It is a known saying of the <hi>Oratour,
Nemo sibi natus, No man is born for himself,</hi> nay
more, no <hi>creature</hi> is made for <hi>it self;</hi> but all that
they may be serviceable to <hi>each other,</hi> and every one
to the <hi>community.</hi> We may <hi>observe</hi> in the several
parts and <hi>members</hi> of our natural <hi>body,</hi> how that their
several <hi>acts</hi> and operations are in reference to the
<hi>whole,</hi> The <hi>eye seeth,</hi> the <hi>foot moveth,</hi> the <hi>mouth
feedeth,</hi> and the <hi>stomack digesteth</hi> not for it <hi>self</hi> only,
but all the <hi>rest</hi> of the <hi>members.</hi> Thus it ought to
be in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Common-wealth;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 5.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith
of <hi>Charity,</hi> that she seeketh not her <hi>own,</hi> to wit not
<hi>only,</hi> nay, in some cases not <hi>principally.</hi> It is the
same <hi>Apostles</hi> counsel to the <hi>Phillippians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Philip. 2. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Look not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48444:8"/>
every man on his own, but the things one of another,</hi> to
which may be <hi>added</hi> and <hi>all</hi> upon the <hi>things</hi> which
concern the <hi>Publick.</hi> The truth is, for this end
hath <hi>God</hi> bestowed upon men several <hi>gifts</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi>
of <hi>art,</hi> of <hi>fortune,</hi> and of <hi>grace,</hi> that with these they
may <hi>serve their Generations.</hi> Yea, for this reason,
as he hath <hi>enriched</hi> several <hi>Countries</hi> with different
<hi>Commodities;</hi> so he hath <hi>furnished</hi> men with seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>gifts,</hi> to <hi>one</hi> in <hi>this</hi> kinde, to <hi>another</hi> in <hi>that,</hi>
that so they may <hi>every</hi> one stand in <hi>need</hi> of, and be
<hi>helpful</hi> to <hi>each</hi> other: nor are we only <hi>Cisterns</hi> to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
but <hi>Conduit Pipes,</hi> to convey that <hi>Water</hi> which
is bestowed upon us: <hi>Treasurers</hi> to lay <hi>up,</hi> but
<hi>Stewards</hi> to lay <hi>out</hi> the <hi>Talents</hi> which are communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to us for the <hi>common</hi> good.</p>
            <p>This is that <hi>Duty</hi> which is incumbent upon <hi>every
man</hi> according to his <hi>capacity</hi> and <hi>Ability,</hi> but more
especially such as <hi>David</hi> was, who had <hi>riches</hi> and <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
men of <hi>wealth</hi> and estate, men of <hi>power</hi> and
authority.</p>
            <p>True it is, there is no man though never so <hi>mean</hi>
and <hi>poor</hi> but may serve his <hi>Generation,</hi> if he have a
<hi>family,</hi> (as most men have) he <hi>serveth</hi> the <hi>Publick</hi>
by well ordering his <hi>houshould,</hi> especially educating
his <hi>children</hi> in the fear of <hi>God,</hi> it being not imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
how great an <hi>influence</hi> that hath upon the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</hi>
If he hath a <hi>Calling</hi> (as <hi>no man</hi> ought
to be <hi>without)</hi> by his <hi>industry</hi> and diligence in that
he doth not only maintain <hi>himself</hi> and <hi>family,</hi> but
<hi>serveth</hi> the <hi>Publick;</hi> Finally, if he be a <hi>pious</hi>
man, by his <hi>good example</hi> to those among whom he
liveth, and both by his <hi>mourning</hi> for the <hi>publick en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormities</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:48444:8"/>
and <hi>prayers</hi> for the <hi>publick welfare</hi> he is
greatly <hi>useful</hi> to the <hi>community,</hi> and therefore let
no man think himself <hi>excused</hi> or disobliged from this
<hi>service.</hi> But yet to make use of our <hi>Saviours</hi>
words,<note place="margin">Luke 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 48.</note> 
               <hi>To whom much is given, of them much is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,</hi>
and consequently, <hi>by them much</hi> ought to be
<hi>performed</hi> in the <hi>service of their generation. Rich</hi>
men with their <hi>gold</hi> and <hi>silver</hi> by works of <hi>Piety</hi> and
<hi>Charity; Great</hi> men with their <hi>power</hi> and <hi>honour,</hi> by
<hi>restraining</hi> and <hi>punishing evil</hi> doers; and by <hi>encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging</hi>
and <hi>rewarding</hi> those who do <hi>well,</hi> since as it
is their <hi>Privilege</hi> that they can, so it is their <hi>Duty</hi>
to be <hi>serviceable</hi> to their <hi>Generation</hi> above others.
It is the difference which <hi>Aristotle</hi> maketh between

as it <hi>shineth</hi> not for it <hi>self</hi> but the <hi>world, serving</hi> all

such ought <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> to be, yea as all the
<hi>Stars</hi> in their several <hi>Spheres</hi> are <hi>useful</hi> to the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi>
so ought all that are set on <hi>high</hi> in any kind of
<hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> at once both <hi>praesse</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse
aliis,</hi> to <hi>go before and be beneficial to others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay such hath been the <hi>temper of publick spirited</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:48444:9"/>
men in publick <hi>places</hi> that they have <hi>empoverished

Though there be more <hi>Danger</hi> to a man's <hi>self by</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Thus ought <hi>all</hi> to be as <hi>stones,</hi> and <hi>great</hi> men as

            <p>Thus did <hi>David</hi> and thus <hi>proportionably</hi> ought we

            <p>Yea well were it if among the <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>mighty</hi>

which have a great deal of <hi>gold</hi> and <hi>silver</hi> in their

Nay which is yet far <hi>worse,</hi> there are some and

there were such among us, I <hi>pray God</hi> there be none
such <hi>still</hi> who in stead of <hi>serving their generation</hi>
serve <hi>themselves</hi> upon the <hi>generation</hi> where they live,

themselves at those flames which <hi>consume</hi> the

people.</p>
            <p>And though I hope the <hi>number</hi> of these is <hi>small,</hi>
yet I fear the most are of a meer <hi>selfish</hi> spirit, not
caring for their <hi>generation</hi> whither it <hi>sink</hi> or <hi>swim,

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48444:11"/>
they may save <hi>their own stake,</hi> or advance their <hi>own
interest;</hi> whereas in truth would we <hi>weigh</hi> things in
the <hi>balance</hi> of <hi>right reason,</hi> we shall find that <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
our own generation</hi> is the best way to secure our
<hi>own interest</hi> and that both as to matter of <hi>profit</hi> and
<hi>honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was <hi>God's Command</hi> to his people in <hi>Babylon,
seek the peace of the City,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jerem. 29. 7.</note> 
               <hi>for in the peace thereof you

if the <hi>ship</hi> sink the <hi>Cabbin</hi> cannot be safe, and
therefore, by <hi>serving</hi> our <hi>generation,</hi> we <hi>serve our

            </p>
            <p>Nay, in this sence to be a <hi>servant</hi> is an <hi>honour,</hi>
else sure St. <hi>Paul</hi> would not have made choice of

Among all the creatures which <hi>God</hi> made, the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>

no not to the <hi>greatest</hi> Potentates: nay
shall I say, It is the grand <hi>reason</hi> why they are <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted</hi>
by <hi>God</hi> with their <hi>power</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> that
thereby they may <hi>serve the generation.</hi> And let
this suffice for a dispatch of the <hi>translation</hi> which we

            </p>
            <p>2. But there is <hi>another</hi> in the <hi>margin</hi> namely that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48444:11"/>
               <hi>David in his own generation served the will of God,</hi>
which seemeth best to correspond with that
which is said of him at the 22th <hi>verse</hi> of this
<hi>chapter</hi> that <hi>he was a man after Gods own heart, and
did fulfil all his will,</hi> and therefore must not be
passed by.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>handling</hi> whereof, I shall again make use
of that forementioned <hi>distinction</hi> of the <hi>will</hi> of <hi>Gods
decree</hi> and <hi>command.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>David served the will of Gods Decree,</hi> and that
both <hi>actively</hi> in respect of the <hi>Church</hi> and her <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>
in his <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>passively</hi> in respect of <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. He served <hi>Gods decree actively,</hi> in as much as
he was a <hi>special instrument</hi> in the <hi>hand of God</hi> for
bringing great things to pass in order to the <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance</hi>
of his <hi>people</hi> and the <hi>Destruction</hi> of their
<hi>enemies,</hi> for so we find in his <hi>history,</hi> how once and
again he <hi>subdued</hi> the <hi>Philistines, recovered</hi> the <hi>Ark</hi>
out of their hands, and <hi>brought it into the City of
David with gladness.</hi>

<hi>Israel</hi> enjoyed <hi>plenty</hi> and <hi>tranquility.</hi> This is that
which is <hi>observable</hi> in all <hi>ages</hi> how <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>found</hi>
out, or rather, <hi>made</hi> some persons <hi>fit</hi> for <hi>eminent</hi>
service, and stirred them up to do noble and <hi>Heroick</hi>
acts for his <hi>Church,</hi> The book of <hi>Judges</hi> affords
plentiful <hi>instances</hi> of this kinde, where we read,
that <hi>God raised up Judges which delivered them out
of the hands of those that spoiled them</hi> such as were
<hi>Othniel,</hi>

with others who from time to time <hi>served the

Time would fail me</hi> to tell you of <hi>Hezekiah</hi>

in both translations so <hi>justly</hi> belongs, having <hi>served</hi>
his own, nay succeeding <hi>generations,</hi> yea, having

by <hi>God</hi> in the accomplishment of his <hi>Will,</hi> is
no small <hi>Honour:</hi> Yea, for this end doth that <hi>God</hi>
(who can when he pleaseth do his own work <hi>without

in several ages to be serviceable to his <hi>Decrees</hi>
in the <hi>protection</hi> of his <hi>Church,</hi> that he may clothe

            </p>
            <p>I cannot <hi>close</hi> up this without taking notice that

to the places where they lived, (among whom

is no <hi>plea</hi> for them that in <hi>some sence</hi> it may be said

serve his <hi>permissive</hi> not his <hi>effective</hi> will, and besides

that howsoever <hi>some</hi> of them adding <hi>hypocrisie</hi> to

their abominable actions they have discovered their
intentions to be <hi>nothing less,</hi> and though they have
after a sort <hi>served the will of God,</hi> yet it was <hi>besides</hi>
nay <hi>against</hi> their <hi>will,</hi> since at the <hi>same</hi> time, and
in the <hi>same</hi> thing whereby <hi>unwittingly</hi> and <hi>unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
they have fufilled <hi>Gods secret will of decree</hi> they
have <hi>wittingly</hi> and <hi>wilfully</hi> violated his <hi>revealed will</hi>
of <hi>command.</hi> And therefore in a far other Notion is
this of <hi>David's serving Gods will</hi> to be understood
in the <hi>Text;</hi> namely, his <hi>ready</hi> accomplishment of
of <hi>Gods decree</hi> in saving his <hi>Church</hi> and destroying
his <hi>enemies,</hi> by these warrantable means which his
<hi>word alloweth,</hi> and his <hi>providence</hi> hath <hi>offered</hi> to him
which as it was highly <hi>commendable</hi> in him, so justly
<hi>imitable</hi> by us upon the like occasions. But</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> he served <hi>Gods will</hi> of <hi>decree,</hi> and that
<hi>passively</hi> in respect of <hi>himself</hi> by his willingness to
<hi>suffer</hi> whatsoever evil <hi>God allotted</hi> to befall him in
his <hi>Generation;</hi> he was a man who experienc'd <hi>both
conditions</hi> of life, namely <hi>prosperity</hi> and <hi>adversity,</hi> nor
was he more <hi>thankful</hi> for the <hi>one</hi> than <hi>patient</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>other,</hi> and that because it was <hi>Gods will,</hi>
for so runs his own language,<note place="margin">Psal. 39. 5.</note> 
               <hi>I was dumb and opened

to this purpose is that <hi>expression</hi> of his hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 15. ver. 25. 26.</note> 
               <hi>If I shall find favour in the eyes of the
Lord he will bring me back, but if he thus say, I have
no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me
as seemeth good to him.</hi> And in this notion this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
belongs to <hi>every good</hi> man, whose <hi>name</hi> like

his <hi>Decrees</hi> both by <hi>doing</hi> and <hi>suffering</hi> (since so

of <hi>serving Gods will,</hi> that is, his <hi>Commandments</hi>

               <hi>We find in the</hi> 119th Psalm David <hi>often pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to</hi> God,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 12. 33. 35. ver.</note> teach me thy statutes, and teach me the
way of thy statutes, and make me to understand the
way of thy precepts; <hi>and accordingly he professeth
that</hi> Gods testimonies were his meditation, <hi>and that</hi>
all the day; <hi>nay,</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 97. 99. 148.</note> 
               <hi>his</hi> eyes prevented the night-watches
that he might meditate in Gods word; <hi>nor was this
only that he might</hi> know <hi>but</hi> do <hi>them, and therefore
he prayeth,</hi> Teach me good Judgement and Knowledge
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48444:14"/>
(and a good understanding have they that do his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments;)
<note place="margin">v. 66. 5. 35. Psal. 111 10.</note> 
               <hi>and again,</hi> Oh that my ways were direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to keep thy statutes, <hi>and again,</hi> make me to go in the
path of thy Commandments. <hi>Thus like a good</hi> servant
<hi>he desired first to</hi> know <hi>his</hi> Masters will, <hi>and then
to</hi> doe <hi>it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as he <hi>served the will of God</hi> so he perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that service.</p>
            <p>1. Cordially, rejoycing in the way of Gods statutes,
<hi>making his</hi> testimonies <hi>his</hi> delight.<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 14 24.</note> 
               <hi>Yea, and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

               <note place="margin">Psal. 40. 6.</note> I delight to do thy will, oh my
God yea thy Law is in my heart.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Speedily,</hi> his resolve is not only to <hi>go</hi> but <hi>run
the way of Gods Commandments,</hi> in his practice <hi>he
made haste and delayed not to keep Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 31. 60.</note> as well knowing, that though in other cases
<hi>haste maketh waste,</hi> yet in this <hi>delay breedeth danger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Universally,</hi> not that he was without particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<hi>failings,</hi> and those gross ones too; but as he
saith himself,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 6. 104.</note> 
               <hi>he had respect to all Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
not <hi>wilfully</hi> living in the <hi>breach</hi> of any; and
again, <hi>I hate every false way,</hi> so that the <hi>bent</hi> of his
<hi>heart</hi> was against all <hi>sin,</hi> and the <hi>course</hi> of his life was
conformable to all <hi>virtue;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 13. 22.</note> and accordingly it is said
of him at the 22 <hi>verse</hi> of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> he did <hi>fulfil</hi>

            </p>
            <p>4. Constantly, in his generation <hi>or</hi> age; <hi>that
is,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 30. 31.</note> to the end <hi>of his</hi> life, <hi>and therefore he saith
not only</hi> I have chosen the way of truth, <hi>but</hi> I
have stuck unto thy Testimonies; <hi>and again,</hi> Thy Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
have I taken as an heritage for ever, and I

               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:48444:14"/>
even unto the end. <hi>All which considered well might
he not only</hi> say <hi>but</hi> ingeminate <hi>it,</hi> Oh Lord, truly I am
thy servant, I am thy servant.</p>
            <p>Thus did <hi>David,</hi> and thus ought <hi>we;</hi> but <hi>do</hi> we
thus? we all <hi>profess</hi> our selves, the <hi>servants</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>
and what is the proper <hi>notion</hi> of a <hi>servant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">116. 16.</note> but one
who is <hi>ad alterius nutum,</hi> at <hi>another</hi> man's <hi>command,</hi>
and therefore <hi>serve God</hi> we cannot if we <hi>serve not</hi> his
Will.<note place="margin">1 Tim 2. 26.</note> But alas how many of us according to Saint
<hi>Pauls</hi> Character, are <hi>taken captive by the Devil at his
will:</hi> and like the <hi>Centurion's</hi> souldiers,<note place="margin">Matt. 8 9.</note> he bids us <hi>go,</hi>
and we go,<note place="margin">Titus 3. 3.</note> 
               <hi>come,</hi> and we <hi>come,</hi> do this and that, and we

(as our Church teacheth us to confess) <hi>the devices
and desires of our own hearts.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4 3.</note> And like those of
whom Saint <hi>Peter</hi> speaketh that <hi>wrought the will of
the gentiles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> we conform to the <hi>humours</hi> of <hi>wicked</hi>
and ungodly men, so far are we from being what we
profess to be <hi>servants,</hi> to the <hi>will of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oh, therefore let us sit down and</hi> consider <hi>with our
selves.</hi> 1. What <hi>the</hi> will <hi>of</hi> God <hi>is, which we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to serve and according to Saint</hi> Pauls <hi>exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 12 1.</note> Prove what is that good, that acceptable and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
will of God. He hath shewed thee, oh man, <hi>saith
the Prophet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Micah 6. 8.</note> what is good, and what doth the Lord thy
God require of thee. <hi>Whatsoever</hi> God willeth <hi>and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
is</hi> good, just <hi>and</hi> equal: <hi>and that were it for</hi>
no other <hi>reason but because</hi> he willeth <hi>and requireth it.</hi>
David <hi>speaking of the</hi> will of God, <hi>saith,</hi> The Law
of the Lord is perfect.<note place="margin">Psal. 19. 7. 8. 9.</note> The Statutes of the Lord are
right. The fear of the Lord is clean. The Judgments of
the Lord are true and righteous altogether: good <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48444:15"/>
we should</hi> serve his will <hi>which is so</hi> just, pure,
right <hi>and</hi> perfect.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Whose will</hi> it is, namely the <hi>Will of God,</hi>
who is,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Supremus in imperando, most supreme in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding,</hi>
having an <hi>absolute</hi> Soveraignty over all his
<hi>creatures;</hi> Wherever the <hi>Supreme</hi> power on earth
resideth, Whither in <hi>one</hi> or <hi>many,</hi> it is and must be
<hi>arbitrary,</hi> but, surely much more in him who is
without a <hi>solaecism</hi> or <hi>hyperbole, most highest king of
kings,</hi> and <hi>lord of lords,</hi> and therefore his <hi>Will</hi> ought
to be our <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>rule</hi> of our <hi>actions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Benignissimus in adjuvando, most gracious in
assisting;</hi> who as in <hi>Justice</hi> he may <hi>command</hi> what
he <hi>will,</hi> so in <hi>mercy</hi> will <hi>enable us</hi> (if we <hi>seek</hi> to him)
to <hi>do</hi> what he <hi>commands;</hi> upon which account it is
that the <hi>yoke</hi> and <hi>burthen</hi> of <hi>Gods law</hi> is said to be
<hi>light and easie.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 11. 29.</note>
            </p>
            <p>3. Indulgentissimus in condonando, most merciful
in forgiving <hi>the</hi> defects <hi>and imperfections of our</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<hi>for so the promise runs,</hi> I will spare them as a man
spareth his son that serveth him accepting <hi>the</hi> will <hi>often
for the</hi> Deed,<note place="margin">Mal. 3. 17.</note> 
               <hi>and</hi> pardoning <hi>the</hi> imperfections <hi>that usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
accompany</hi> best <hi>deeds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Munificentissimus in remunerando, most boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
in recompencing <hi>those who</hi> serve <hi>him. Indeed,
there wants not prophane</hi> Atheists <hi>who say,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. 15.</note> It is in
vain to serve the Lord; <hi>but Saint</hi> Paul <hi>hath assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hebr. 11. 6.</note> He is a rewarder of them that seek him diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
<hi>nay he is not only a</hi> rewarder, <hi>but he</hi> himself <hi>is
the</hi> reward:<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 1.</note> 
               <hi>they are his own words to</hi> Abraham, I
am thy exceeding great reward.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:48444:15"/>
And surely upon all these <hi>considerations,</hi> we shall
conclude that nothing is more <hi>reasonable</hi> than after
<hi>David's</hi> pattern <hi>in our Generation to serve the will of
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the <hi>Character</hi> of his <hi>life,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> proceed we more
briefly to the <hi>threefold character</hi> of his <hi>Death,</hi> by
which is described the <hi>state</hi> of the <hi>Dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. He fell asleep, <hi>that respects the</hi> person.</p>
            <p>2. Was laid to his Fathers, <hi>that respects both his</hi>
soul <hi>and</hi> body.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>And saw corruption,</hi> that only respects the <hi>body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>He fell asleep,</hi> Those words which precede,
<hi>The will of God,</hi> are by some <hi>intepreters</hi> referr'd
to <hi>this</hi> clause <hi>he fell asleep;</hi> in which <hi>construction</hi>
they afford us a good <hi>instruction;</hi> namely that <hi>death</hi>
befalls us not by <hi>chance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Erasm. in Cor.</note> but <hi>by the will of God.</hi> It is
<hi>appointed</hi> (saith the <hi>Apostle) for men once to dy,</hi> and
not only the <hi>thing</hi> it self in general,<note place="margin">Hebr. 9. 27.</note> but the <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi>
as to <hi>individuals;</hi> namely, the <hi>means, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
place, time,</hi> are all appointed <hi>by the will</hi> and
counsel of <hi>God,</hi> we are all in this world as so many
<hi>Tenants</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> the great <hi>Landlord;</hi> and this not for
any certain <hi>term</hi> of <hi>years,</hi> but <hi>durante beneplacito,
during his good pleasure</hi> we <hi>come</hi> in, and <hi>stay,</hi> and <hi>go
out</hi> of this <hi>world:</hi> so much that prayer of <hi>Sime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
imports, <hi>Lord, lettest thou thy servant depart in
peace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 2. 29.</note> we can neither <hi>stay longer</hi> nor <hi>go sooner</hi> than
<hi>God</hi> pleaseth. A <hi>consideration</hi> which ought to be an
<hi>argument</hi> of <hi>contentation</hi> both in respect of our <hi>selves</hi>
and <hi>others</hi> whensoever or howsoever they <hi>dye,</hi> since
it is by the <hi>will of God,</hi> to which we must <hi>necessarily</hi>
and ought <hi>voluntarily</hi> to <hi>submit.</hi>

               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:48444:16"/>
2. <hi>To let this go, I might further</hi> observe <hi>that it is
said of</hi> David, he fell asleep after he had served the
will of God in his generation, <hi>or,</hi> served his generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the Will of God <hi>not</hi> before, <hi>nor doth any of</hi>
Gods servants <hi>dye before they have</hi> fulfilled <hi>the
work for which</hi> God sent <hi>them into the</hi> world. <hi>It is
said of our blessed</hi> Saviour <hi>that</hi> though the Jews
sought to take him,<note place="margin">John 7. 30. 9. 4.</note> yet no man laid hands on him, for
his hour was not come; <hi>yea, he saith of himself,</hi> I
must work the work of him that sent me into this world,
whilst it is day; <hi>not did the</hi> day <hi>(to wit of his</hi> life)
exspire <hi>till he had</hi> done <hi>that</hi> work. The time of my
departure <hi>saith St.</hi> Paul is at hand, <hi>but what follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi>
I have finished my course, then, <hi>and not</hi> till <hi>then,
was the</hi> time of his departure,<note place="margin">Tim. 4. 6. 7.</note> when he had finished his
course. <hi>It is that which may very much</hi> comfort <hi>us
whensoever</hi> death <hi>seemeth to, or really doth</hi> approach
<hi>that as we dye not</hi> before <hi>the</hi> time <hi>which</hi> God <hi>hath</hi>
allotted <hi>us to</hi> live, <hi>so neither</hi> before <hi>the</hi> service <hi>be</hi>
done <hi>which he hath</hi> appointed <hi>for us in</hi> our generation,
<hi>and if that</hi> be done, <hi>we have reason to be</hi> willing <hi>to
ly</hi> down <hi>to</hi> sleep <hi>as here</hi> David, after he had served
his Generation, fell asleep.</p>
            <p>3. But that which I here <hi>especially</hi> take notice of
is, that <hi>Death</hi> is resembled to a <hi>Sleep.</hi> It is observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
among <hi>prophane</hi> writers both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine
Poets</hi> and <hi>Oratours,</hi> that <hi>sleep</hi> is said to be the <hi>image,</hi>
the <hi>kindred,</hi> the <hi>Sister,</hi> the <hi>brother of</hi> Death, and
this <hi>metaphor</hi> is frequently used in the <hi>holy scriptures,</hi>
in the <hi>Old Testament</hi> promiscuously of both <hi>bad</hi> and
<hi>good,</hi> in the <hi>New,</hi> especially of the <hi>good,</hi> who are said
not only to <hi>sleep,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Thess. 4. 14.</note> but to <hi>sleep in Jesus:</hi> and to <hi>sleep
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48444:16"/>
in the Lord.</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 11. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

this more particularly in a <hi>double</hi> respect.</p>
            <p>1. Sleep <hi>is a</hi> levamen laborum, <hi>a</hi> quiet repose <hi>and

<hi>This life is a</hi> wilderness <hi>of</hi> troubles, <hi>wherein our</hi> bodies
<hi>are exposed to</hi> pains <hi>and</hi> pain, <hi>and our</hi> souls <hi>suffer

the</hi> body <hi>is</hi> common <hi>to the</hi> wicked <hi>with the</hi> righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous;
<hi>but in regard of the</hi> soul peculiar <hi>to the</hi>

               <hi>True, the soul doth not as the</hi> Psuchopannuchists
<hi>fondly asserted,</hi> sleep with the body, <hi>nor yet</hi> as the

which the</hi> soul performeth <hi>by the help of the</hi> body,
<hi>yet its</hi> immanent <hi>and</hi> immaterial <hi>acts are performed

and sigh,</hi> but these shall <hi>awake and sing.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
saith <hi>David</hi> of himself,<note place="margin">Isa. 26. 20.</note> 
               <hi>my flesh shall rest in hope,</hi>
and again,<note place="margin">Ps. 16. 7. 17. 15.</note> 
               <hi>When I awake, I shall be satisfied with thy
likeness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that, to <hi>close up</hi> this, seek not <hi>consolation
against Death,</hi> but let <hi>death</hi> it self be our <hi>consolation.</hi>
True it is, <hi>Death</hi> it self is very <hi>terrible,</hi> yea, the <hi>king
of terrours,</hi> and the <hi>thoughts</hi> of it so <hi>dreadful</hi> that we
are very <hi>unwilling</hi> to <hi>entertain</hi> them. But lo, here it
is <hi>reprefented</hi> to us in a <hi>mollifying Phrase,</hi> and that
which is <hi>familiar</hi> to us: and why thus? but to <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate</hi>
our fears of <hi>death,</hi> upon which account <hi>Christs
crucifing</hi> is called a <hi>lifting up,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 3. 14.</note> and the <hi>afflictions</hi> of
Gods servants <hi>instructions,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psa. 94. 3.</note> to smooth the <hi>roughness</hi>
and asperity of them, and withall to render <hi>death fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar</hi>
to us, that every <hi>evening</hi> when we <hi>put off</hi> our
<hi>clothes, ly down</hi> in our <hi>beds,</hi> and <hi>fall asleep,</hi> we may
call to mind our <hi>Death,</hi> and our <hi>grave,</hi> looking upon
<hi>this</hi> as a bed, and <hi>that</hi> as a <hi>sleep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The next Character of death <hi>David</hi> is, <hi>that
he was laid to his fathers,</hi> which I have already told
you, may be understood in reference either to the
<hi>Soul or</hi> the <hi>Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. To the <hi>Soul,</hi> and so the <hi>meaning</hi> is, that when
he <hi>fell asleep,</hi> his <hi>soul</hi> went to the <hi>nest</hi> of those <hi>holy
Patriarchs</hi> which were <hi>gone before</hi> him.<note place="margin">Ps. 39. 12.</note> 
               <hi>I am a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48444:18"/>
upon earth, and a sojourner,</hi> saith <hi>David, as all
my Fathers were:</hi> because as <hi>they</hi> so <hi>he,</hi> had but a
<hi>short</hi> continuance upon <hi>earth,</hi> and looked upon
<hi>themselves</hi> as going hence, and when he <hi>went</hi> hence,
he went to <hi>those</hi> his <hi>Fathers,</hi> which had gone <hi>before</hi>
him: What that <hi>place</hi> was, I shall not stay to <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
most certainly</hi> it was <hi>not</hi> a <hi>Limbus subterraneus,
prison</hi> under ground, <hi>on this side hell,</hi> where their
<hi>souls</hi> were <hi>detain'd</hi> till <hi>Christs resurrection: most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly</hi> it was the <hi>bosom of Abraham;</hi> and that a place
of <hi>comfort:</hi> yea, <hi>most probably</hi> (by our <hi>Saviours</hi>
words) <hi>the kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 8. 11.</note> And it is no small
<hi>comfort</hi> to consider, that when we <hi>dye,</hi> we shall
be <hi>gathered</hi> to our <hi>godly Ancestors</hi> and Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours.</p>
            <p>2. To the <hi>body,</hi> and so it may be taken in a <hi>nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi>
or an <hi>enlarged</hi> sence, in a <hi>narrow</hi> sence: those are
laid to their <hi>Fathers,</hi> who are <hi>buried</hi> in the same
<hi>Grave</hi> or Vault with their Progenitors: but in this
<hi>sence</hi> this was not true of <hi>David,</hi> for where it is
said, <hi>He slept with his Fathers,</hi> it presently follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<note place="margin">2 Kings 2. 10.</note> 
               <hi>and he was buried in the City of David,</hi> which
<hi>City</hi> of <hi>David</hi> was not <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> the place of his
<hi>Fathers,</hi> but <hi>Sion</hi> the place where the <hi>Kings</hi> were
buried; so that it must be taken in an enlarged sence,
inasmuch as the <hi>grave</hi> being the common <hi>recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi>
of <hi>all</hi> men,<note place="margin">Ps. 16. 10.</note> any one being <hi>buried,</hi> is laid to his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
because in a <hi>grave,</hi> which is the <hi>place</hi> for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:
and so gathered <hi>quasi in tumulum &amp; cumulum,</hi>
to the <hi>heap</hi> of <hi>dead</hi> bodies.</p>
            <p>It is that consideration which should render the
<hi>grave</hi> so much the <hi>less dreadful</hi> to us, because it is no
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48444:18"/>
more than what is <hi>common</hi> to our <hi>Fathers,</hi> nay, to the
whole race of them that dwell upon the earth.</p>
            <p>3. The last <hi>Character</hi> referrs only to the <hi>body,</hi>
which is <hi>that he saw corruption. Seeing</hi> (according
to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Phrase) is as much as <hi>experiencing;</hi>
so we read else where of <hi>seeing death, what man is he
that liveth</hi> (saith the Psalmist) <hi>and shall not see death?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 89. 48.</note>
there were never any but two, <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi>
and I may say, <hi>What man is he that dieth, and shall
not see corruption?</hi> there was never any but <hi>one, the</hi>

               <note place="margin">Paterc.</note> he was <hi>vir in tantum laudandus in quantum vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus

<hi>circumference</hi> of his <hi>Encomium,</hi> may very well
take in all the <hi>lines</hi> of <hi>virtue,</hi> which meet in him as
in their <hi>Center:</hi> and I could heartily <hi>wish</hi> that as those

               <note place="margin">Cypr. cp. 26.</note>
               <hi>Vigorous expressions</hi> were correspondent to the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

he commended, so I could now draw the <hi>Picture</hi> of

But alas my <hi>Pencil</hi> giveth so <hi>rough</hi> a <hi>draught,</hi> that I
am afraid I shall but <hi>disfigure</hi> him whilst I go about to
<hi>commend</hi> him, so that I am ready to draw back my

any shall think I say <hi>too much,</hi> I shall ascribe it to
their <hi>ignorance</hi> since none who <hi>knew</hi> him but must

of him than what not only very <hi>credible</hi> information

<hi>warrant</hi> me; having had the honour of more than 20

            </p>
            <p>The truth is as <hi>Titus Vespasian</hi> was called <hi>deliciae

concerning him, what one said, who met
with a book called <hi>Herculis encomium, The praise of
Hercules, Quis Lacedaemoniorum unquam vituperavit,
who ever dispraised him,</hi> to wit, that <hi>knew</hi> him.</p>
            <p>His very <hi>outward</hi> aspect was <hi>amiable</hi> nay <hi>venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
and his presence as the appearance of some <hi>benign
Star</hi> having a <hi>pleasing influence</hi> upon all that looked

that <hi>virtuous</hi> soul, which inhabited his <hi>comely

            <p>The Tongue of the Just <hi>(saith</hi> Solomon) is as choyce

<hi>but all who</hi> conversed <hi>with him, among whom
I can truly say,</hi> I never went to him, but I did, or
might come away from him bettered by his gracious and
prudent discourse: <hi>Nor was he only, as I doubt too
many are,</hi> a man of words, <hi>his</hi> goodness <hi>was not only

               <hi>so that he was not only in respect of his</hi> words,

            <p>It is said of <hi>David, that he died in a good old age, full
of riches and honours:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 29. 28.</note> The <hi>age</hi> to which this worthy

was above 81. years old when he <hi>died;</hi> and if <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
were a <hi>good</hi> old age, his was <hi>better,</hi> being more

               <hi>and peace upon Israel,</hi> was abundantly <hi>made

lived to <hi>see</hi> both <hi>domestick</hi> and <hi>foreign wars,</hi> yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he died, he saw <hi>peace</hi> upon our <hi>English Israel,</hi>
which <hi>God of his mercy long continue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as he was <hi>full</hi> of <hi>daies,</hi> so he <hi>filled</hi> these
<hi>daies</hi> with all sorts of <hi>good actions,</hi> he well knew the
<hi>worth</hi> of <hi>time,</hi> which we for the most part <hi>undervalue:</hi>
and accounting every <hi>minute pretious,</hi> took care to
spend not only his <hi>daies,</hi> but his <hi>hours well;</hi> so that his
<hi>gray hairs</hi> being <hi>found in a way of righteousness</hi> were a
<hi>crown</hi> to him: and what <hi>Scaliger</hi> said of <hi>Strisset,</hi> may
no less justly be said of <hi>him,</hi> it was pity, <hi>ut aut seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um

that age should have made him old, or the law of nature
bereaved him of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>honour,</hi> it is true, he came far <hi>short</hi>

was pleased so far to <hi>bless</hi> his honest <hi>indeavours</hi> in that

he enjoyed a <hi>liberal</hi> portion of this <hi>worlds goods,</hi> nor

<hi>David</hi> indeed was a <hi>King,</hi> and so the <hi>supreme</hi> person in
his <hi>kingdom.</hi> He was, whilst <hi>Lord Mayor,</hi> chief offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer

<hi>Place,</hi> he did by virtue of his <hi>office,</hi> represent the
<hi>King's person.</hi> Whatsoever <hi>honor</hi> in the <hi>City,</hi> he was
<hi>capable</hi> of, he was <hi>chosen to: Master of his Company;
Alderman of a Ward; President of St.</hi> Thomas <hi>his
Hospital;</hi> several times <hi>Burgess in Parliament,</hi> though
the <hi>iniquity</hi> of the times would not permit him to <hi>sit:

much <hi>inferiour;</hi> no, nor yet <hi>better</hi> than <hi>David,</hi> nor
yet so <hi>good:</hi> But thus much I <hi>dare</hi> say, it was his lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
<hi>ambition</hi> to be as <hi>good,</hi> he indeavoured to tread
<hi>in Davids</hi> footsteps, and what is said in my <hi>Text</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>David,</hi> I shall confidently affirm of him, and
that in both translations, <hi>He was one who served his
own generation by the will of God; and who in his own ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
served the will of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Throughout the <hi>age of his life,</hi> he was through
<hi>God's</hi> Providence instated in manifold <hi>Relations,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
with various <hi>offices,</hi> conversant in several <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,</hi>
in all which he had <hi>no cause</hi> to complain
with him who said, <hi>Omnia fui, nihil profui, I was
every thing, and profited nothing.</hi> All of them, being
as so many <hi>Cutts</hi> and <hi>Chanels,</hi> through which did
<hi>run</hi> his several vertues and <hi>graces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now as he said of St.</hi> Cyprian, Onerosum enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merare,
It would be a burdensome task to enumerate <hi>all
particulars, since</hi> Inopem me copia fecit, Plenty makes
me poor; <hi>and I have</hi> so much <hi>to say, that I know not</hi>
where <hi>to</hi> begin.</p>
            <p>If you please, I will <hi>begin</hi> with that which is (in
Solomons language) <hi>the beginning of wisdom,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>the fear of the Lord.</hi> He was eminent for <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
and <hi>Devotion:</hi> That <hi>Orthodox</hi> Religion which is
professed in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> he faithfully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered
to, cordially <hi>owning</hi> her <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Discipline,
Hierarchy</hi> and <hi>Liturgy:</hi> and though he lived in an
<hi>inconstant</hi> age (wherein it was the mode to change
<hi>Religions,</hi> as women do <hi>fashions)</hi> he proved not a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48444:22"/>
               <hi>reed</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> a <hi>willow,</hi> but an <hi>Oak, stedfast</hi> and <hi>immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
Great</hi> was his <hi>respect</hi> to the <hi>Orthodox</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoprax
Clergy:</hi> Those who were <hi>Sufferers</hi> he chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
relieved: Those who were <hi>Labourers,</hi> he
bountifully <hi>encouraged.</hi> The very <hi>feet</hi> of them that
<hi>served</hi> at the <hi>Altar</hi> were <hi>beautiful in his eies;</hi> and I
should be very <hi>ingrateful,</hi> if I should not acknowledg
<hi>my self</hi> (though most unworthy) to have had a <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamen's</hi>
share in his Favour. <hi>Schismatical Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
he <hi>ahhorred,</hi> but duly <hi>frequented</hi> the <hi>Church As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies:</hi>
I was for many <hi>yeares</hi> an <hi>ocular</hi> witness of
his attendance on the <hi>Publick</hi> Ordinances, where he
was a <hi>Joint Petitioner</hi> at the <hi>Throne</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> a <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
Auditor of God's word,</hi> a <hi>diligent receiver</hi> of the
<hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> from the <hi>monethly</hi> administration
whereof I do not remember he was absent, if in
Town and in health: and though it was an <hi>age</hi>
wherein <hi>irreverence</hi> was in <hi>fashion</hi> and <hi>Devotion</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryed
as <hi>superstition,</hi> he was <hi>exemplary</hi> for his <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent</hi>
behaviour in <hi>God's house,</hi> seldom at <hi>Prayers</hi>
but upon his <hi>knees,</hi> unless want of room hindred him,
his <hi>head</hi> still <hi>uncovered</hi> at the <hi>reading</hi> and <hi>preaching</hi>
of <hi>Gods word,</hi> and alwaies <hi>kneeling</hi> at the <hi>Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion:</hi>
nor was he only (as I fear too <hi>many</hi> are) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
in the <hi>Church,</hi> but his <hi>Family, praying with</hi>
and <hi>for</hi> them, and giving wholesome <hi>Counsels</hi> to
them. That <hi>Character</hi> which <hi>Almighty God</hi> giveth
concerning <hi>Abraham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 18. 19.</note> 
               <hi>for I know him, that he will
command his Children, and his houshold after him to
keep the way of the Lord,</hi> did <hi>justly</hi> belong to him,
whose <hi>care</hi> it was to bring up his <hi>Children</hi> in the <hi>fear</hi>
and <hi>instruct</hi> his <hi>servants</hi> in the <hi>ways</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48444:22"/>
his <hi>resolve</hi> was that of <hi>Joshua,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Josh. 24. 15.</note> 
               <hi>I and my house will serve
the Lord.</hi> Finally, <hi>trace</hi> him not only from <hi>God's house</hi>
to <hi>his own,</hi> but from his <hi>chamber</hi> to his <hi>closet;</hi> and
there you might have found him, <hi>daily</hi> setting time
apart for his <hi>meditations</hi> and <hi>devotions:</hi> nor could any
<hi>secular</hi> affairs divert him from <hi>God's Service,</hi> and
therefore when his occasions called him forth <hi>sooner,</hi>
he would still rise the <hi>earlier,</hi> that he might <hi>begin</hi> the
day with <hi>God,</hi> with whom he always also <hi>closed it up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus during his <hi>age</hi> and generation in this world,
<hi>he served</hi> his <hi>God;</hi> and no less careful was he to <hi>serve</hi>
his <hi>King,</hi> remembring, that <hi>Fear the Lord and the
King</hi> are joyned together by <hi>Solomon.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 24. 21.</note> He was a stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
asserter of <hi>Monarchical</hi> Government. Nor can
I pass by one <hi>argument</hi> which he often used upon
that account, where <hi>Almighty God</hi> by his Prophet
<hi>Ezekiel</hi> reconing up the manifold <hi>blessings</hi> he had
conferr'd upon his People <hi>Israel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezeck. 16. 13.</note> mentioneth this
among the rest, as none of the least, <hi>thou didst pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper
into a Kingdom;</hi> by which is clearly intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that those nations are most <hi>prosperous</hi> which are
under <hi>Kingly</hi> Government; nay that <hi>Kingly</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is a <hi>prosperity</hi> to a people. He was, I dare say,
among the number of the <hi>mourners</hi> in Sion, for all the
<hi>Abominations</hi> which were committed, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for that <hi>execrable treason</hi> in <hi>murthering</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi>
and <hi>banishing</hi> the <hi>Son;</hi> nor did he cease to be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
<hi>Petitioner</hi> at <hi>Heaven gates</hi> for the <hi>restau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Church.</hi> Upon the account of
his <hi>Loyalty</hi> to <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>first,</hi> of blessed memory,
When <hi>Lord Mayor,</hi> his <hi>house</hi> was <hi>searched</hi> by the
<hi>rebels</hi> then in power, supposing there to have <hi>found</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:48444:23"/>
the <hi>King:</hi> the <hi>year after</hi> he was cast into the <hi>Tower,</hi>
and there kept a <hi>Prisoner,</hi> and for several years put
by all Publick <hi>offices</hi> and <hi>imployments,</hi> they finding
him a man that would not be <hi>moulded</hi> into their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>formes,</hi> nor make <hi>shipwrack</hi> of his Conscience to
<hi>serve</hi> their <hi>interests.</hi> Upon the account of his <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty</hi>
to <hi>Charles the Second (Whom God Almighty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper)</hi>
during his <hi>Exile,</hi> he hazarded his <hi>estate</hi> and
<hi>life,</hi> by sending him considerable <hi>summes of money</hi>
beyond sea; and when the <hi>Blessed time</hi> came of his
<hi>joyful Return</hi> to his Throne, though he was in the
73. year of his <hi>age,</hi> which might have been a just <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse</hi>
for his <hi>staying at home,</hi> this aged <hi>Banzillai</hi> went
not only over <hi>Jordan river,</hi> but crossed the <hi>Sea</hi> to
attend his <hi>Soveraign</hi> home.</p>
            <p>Next to <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King,</hi> I dare say, the <hi>City</hi> of
<hi>London</hi> was written upon his <hi>heart,</hi> wherein he spent
by far the <hi>greatest</hi> part of his <hi>life,</hi> and hath now
<hi>breathed</hi> his <hi>last.</hi> Here, through <hi>God's blessing,</hi> he
<hi>got,</hi> and here he <hi>spent</hi> a considerable part of his <hi>estate</hi>
in the <hi>Citie's</hi> service. He was of so <hi>publick</hi> a spirit,
that when his Son in Law brought him the first <hi>news</hi>
of his being chosen <hi>Sheriff</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<hi>dismissed</hi> the particular business about which
he was, and never after <hi>personally</hi> followed his <hi>trade,</hi>
but gave himself up to the <hi>City</hi> concernes. It was
his <hi>study</hi> to know the <hi>Customes</hi> and <hi>usages,</hi> the <hi>liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
and <hi>priviledges</hi> of the <hi>City,</hi> and accordingly his <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour</hi>
in his several <hi>capacities</hi> to preserve and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them. He was not only in <hi>word</hi> but in <hi>deed</hi> an <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistant,</hi>
a <hi>Guardian,</hi> yea a <hi>Pillar</hi> of the <hi>Right Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Company</hi> of <hi>Drapers.</hi> He was a <hi>vigilant President
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48444:23"/>
of</hi> Saint <hi>Thomas his Hospital,</hi> which probably had
been <hi>ruined</hi> before this, but that his <hi>sagacity</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dustry</hi>
discovered the <hi>fraud</hi> of an <hi>unjust steward.</hi> In
the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Aldermen</hi> he was as an <hi>Oracle,</hi> very subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient
by his grave and <hi>prudent</hi> counsels to the <hi>Cities</hi>
Government. He was so far from <hi>self-seeking,</hi> that
when he was <hi>Lord Mayor,</hi> he did not make those ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
(which usually are) by selling the <hi>vacant</hi>
places. Whilst a <hi>private tradesman,</hi> he was <hi>exact</hi>
(so far as I ever heard) in <hi>commutative</hi> Justice, in his
<hi>bargains</hi> and <hi>contracts</hi> of buying and selling: and when
a <hi>publick Magistrate,</hi> he was no less <hi>conscientious</hi> of
<hi>distributive Justice</hi> between man and man, so that
what <hi>Lampridius,</hi> said of <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> he was
<hi>Virbonus &amp; reipublicae necessarius, a good man and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
needful for the Common wealth,</hi> may be affirmed
of him in reference to the <hi>City,</hi> he was not only a
<hi>good man,</hi> but exceedingly useful by his <hi>Justice</hi> and
<hi>prudence</hi> for the <hi>Cities</hi> welfare.</p>
            <p>I must not forget to tell you how he <hi>served</hi> the
Town where he received his <hi>first breath,</hi> by building
there and <hi>endowing</hi> a <hi>Free-School</hi> with a considerable
<hi>maintenance</hi> for the <hi>education</hi> of Children. How he
hath <hi>served</hi> the University of <hi>Cambridge</hi> by erecting
an <hi>Arabick Lecture,</hi> and setling upon the <hi>Lecturer
40 l.</hi> per annum for his pains in <hi>reading</hi> it; hereby te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying
himself to be a <hi>lover</hi> of <hi>learning,</hi> to which,
indeed, <hi>none</hi> is an <hi>enemy</hi> but the <hi>ignorant:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>he could not,</hi> having himself a very <hi>competent</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of <hi>knowledg:</hi> Nor were these <hi>munificent</hi> works
to bear the date of their <hi>beginning</hi> from his <hi>death,</hi> but
the one began 20 and the other 30 years ago, nor is
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48444:24"/>
their <hi>maintenance</hi> only setled for some <hi>term</hi> of years,
but (as we usually express it) <hi>for ever:</hi> by which
means he hath not only <hi>served</hi> his own, but <hi>succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Generations;</hi> nay, in that <hi>Arabick</hi> lecture he hath
served those remote <hi>Eastern</hi> parts of the <hi>world,</hi> upon
which account (at the desire of the <hi>Reverend Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Wheelock,</hi> now with <hi>God)</hi> he was at the <hi>charge</hi> of
printing the <hi>Persian Gospels</hi> and transmitting them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
those <hi>parts:</hi> yea, by these wayes he endeavoured
to <hi>serve</hi> the <hi>Lord Christ</hi> promoting the <hi>Christian
Religion</hi> and (to use his <hi>own Language) throwing a
stone at the forehead of Mahomet</hi> that grand <hi>Impostor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus he was <hi>serviceable</hi> in his <hi>Generation</hi> to the
<hi>will of God.</hi> Honor of <hi>Christ,</hi> Welfare of the <hi>City,</hi>
Benefit of <hi>Country</hi> and <hi>University:</hi> nor was he awan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to <hi>serve</hi> the <hi>Poor</hi> neither by his <hi>Charity:</hi> his
<hi>hands</hi> were frequently open whilst he <hi>lived</hi> upon all
<hi>occasions,</hi> and notwithstanding many late great <hi>da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages</hi>
to his <hi>estate,</hi> he hath given considerable <hi>legacies</hi>
to the <hi>poor</hi> of several <hi>Parishes,</hi> to <hi>Hospitals,</hi> to <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi>
widows, and such like at his death; all which I
cannot now <hi>stay</hi> particularly to enumerate.</p>
            <p>Finally, let me not <hi>tire</hi> your <hi>Patience,</hi> if to the <hi>rest</hi> of
his <hi>graces</hi> and vertues, I adde his <hi>Patience,</hi> whereby he
<hi>served the will of God</hi> in <hi>suffering.</hi> To <hi>serve the will of
God</hi> in <hi>doing good</hi> was his <hi>meat and drink:</hi> to <hi>submit</hi>
to <hi>his will</hi> in <hi>suffering evil</hi> was his <hi>Antidote</hi> and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial.</hi>
The truth is, this good mans <hi>coat</hi> (like <hi>Josephs)</hi>
was <hi>particoloured,</hi> his <hi>wine</hi> mixed with <hi>water,</hi> nay
with <hi>gall</hi> and <hi>wormwood;</hi> many doleful <hi>losses</hi> he met
with, as to his worldly goods, some disastrous <hi>crosses</hi>
in his near <hi>Relations, such</hi> (as himself said) <hi>he could
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48444:24"/>
not have born, were it not for this Book,</hi> pointing to the
<hi>Bible</hi> which lay before him, but there he met still with
that which comforted him: frequently (among
others) making use of that <hi>Passage</hi> of <hi>Job</hi> to his
wife,<note place="margin">Job 2. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Shall we receive good at the hands of God, and
shall we not receive evil.</hi> The latter years of his life
have been <hi>years</hi> of <hi>Pain</hi> to him, by reason of that
Disease of the <hi>Stone</hi> in the <hi>bladder,</hi> whereof at last he
<hi>died:</hi> A <hi>stone</hi> so <hi>weighty,</hi> that it exceeded 25 ounces,
so <hi>grievous,</hi> that a little before his death it made him
<hi>roar,</hi> but yet not <hi>murmur:</hi> God graciously support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him under the <hi>weight,</hi> and <hi>sustaining</hi> him under the
<hi>pain</hi> of it, and indeed the <hi>Providence</hi> of God was sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
<hi>remarkable,</hi> in that having a <hi>stone</hi> of so vast a
<hi>bigness</hi> in his bladder, his pain was comparatively so <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi>
&amp; his life so <hi>long,</hi> for had there not been as it were a
<hi>way</hi> pav'd, or rather a <hi>channel</hi> cut through the <hi>stone</hi> for
his <hi>Water</hi> to pass<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>stoppage</hi> of it, must of necessity
have very much <hi>added</hi> to his <hi>smart</hi> &amp; <hi>lessened</hi> his <hi>days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He hath now taken his <hi>leave</hi> of this <hi>world,</hi> and
truly,<note place="margin">Ambros.</note> I may very well say of him in St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> his
Language, <hi>in illo uno non unum sed plures amissos re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirimus,</hi>
in this <hi>one</hi> person there is a manifold <hi>loss;</hi>
whilst passing by <hi>private</hi> losses, The <hi>King</hi> hath lost a
<hi>loyal Subject,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> a <hi>faithful Son,</hi> and the <hi>City,</hi>
a <hi>prudent Senatour:</hi> indeed, he was so eminently <hi>use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
every way, that his loss would have been <hi>insuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,</hi>
did not this <hi>Consideration</hi> quallifie it, that he <hi>died</hi>
in so <hi>old</hi> an <hi>age,</hi> that according to <hi>course</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> he
could not have <hi>lived much longer:</hi> nay, considering
his <hi>disease,</hi> it is a <hi>wonder</hi> that he <hi>lived so long. He</hi> is
departed from the <hi>Inn</hi> of this <hi>world,</hi> to the long <hi>home</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:48444:25"/>
of his <hi>grave,</hi> of which, I am sure he was <hi>many</hi> years
<hi>before mindeful,</hi> it being his frequent <hi>language</hi> upon
several <hi>occasions Sclum mihi superest sepulchrum, I have
nothing to make account of but only my grave:</hi> where

            </p>
