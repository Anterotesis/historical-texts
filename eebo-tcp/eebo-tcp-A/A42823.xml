         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHen I am ask't the reason of M. <hi>Stubbe's fierceness</hi> against the ROYAL SOCIETY, and the favourers of <hi>that</hi> Institution; my usual answer is, <hi>There are creatures that will bark against those who never hurt or provoked them, and '<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Why</hi>? 'Tis the <hi>nature</hi> of those <hi>Animals,</hi> and that's the only account can be given.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Stubbe</hi> hath kept a noise ever since he could <hi>open,</hi> against <hi>all men,</hi> except M. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> and the <hi>Republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi>; and all <hi>things,</hi> but <hi>Quakerism</hi> and <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy.</hi> He hath faln with a vehemence suitable to his nature upon <hi>Monarchy, Ministry, Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,</hi> and Humane <hi>Learning</hi>; provoking all men to whom those interests were dear. But perceiving he had the fate of old <hi>Alexander Ross,</hi> to be <hi>despised</hi> by those, he had <hi>affron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ation, he turns about and confutes himself: he pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s on a mighty zeal for <hi>those things,</hi> which he had endeavour'd to <hi>w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

S. with his usual <hi>noise</hi> and <hi>vehemence:</hi> He clamours, that <hi>this Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is destructive to <hi>Monarchy, Church</hi> of <hi>England, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities,</hi> and all <hi>ancient Literature</hi>; and follows his confident accusations with loud <hi>outc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53427:3"/>By his <hi>earnest</hi> noise, he frights some that know not the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>Creature</hi>; and hath possest divers, who are not well informed concerning the Institution of the ROYAL SOCIETY, with <hi>terrible</hi> apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of it. This is all M. <hi>Stubbe ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For <hi>this</hi> reason I have thought it requisite to begin my <hi>answer</hi> in an account of his <hi>temper</hi> and <hi>genius</hi> out of his own Writings; and when that is known, his <hi>greatest</hi> force is disabled: for his <hi>impudent censures</hi> will be no longer <hi>heeded,</hi> in which his <hi>chief</hi> power lies. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not <hi>here,</hi> as in <hi>ordinary</hi> cases, when <hi>reflections</hi> that expose the <hi>person,</hi> signifie little to the <hi>cause.</hi> But on the contrary, the <hi>Representation</hi> I have made of <hi>this Adversary,</hi> is one of the most proper services can be done it; and if I should say nothing else, it were an <hi>Answer.</hi> For he that proves an Accuser to have been a <hi>continual P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I say, I thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>st, since by it I shall break that part of his strength which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in those slanders and contempts which he pours up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Experimental</hi> Philosophers; aud after <hi>that,</hi> his <hi>Other Arguments</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> will prove like <hi>Swords</hi> of <hi>Flags</hi> and <hi>Spears</hi> of <hi>Bulrush,</hi> as will appear in <hi>that</hi> part where I make tryal of their strength.</p>
            <p>This my design, of which I have now given the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, might, 'tis like, be some occasion of the <hi>figment</hi> over which he so couragiously insults, <hi>viz [That the Uirtuosi intended to write his life;]</hi> when I dare say, there was never more thought of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o this purpose, than some such collection out of his Writings and I have made; and therefore he might have forborn the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements</hi> of <hi>mean spirits,</hi> and <hi>pitiful, ridiculous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:53427:3"/>
which he bestows on them on <hi>this</hi> occasion: For there are none of those Gentlemen but scorn to be so <hi>dirty, impertinent,</hi> and so <hi>like</hi> M. <hi>Stubbe,</hi> as to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with any passages of his <hi>Life,</hi> which do not tend to the weakening him in that unworthy cause in which his pride and spight have engaged him.</p>
            <p>But he is resolved, he saith, to <hi>prevent</hi> the <hi>Virtuosi,</hi> and to <hi>write his Life</hi> himself; and 'tis like the <hi>Comical Wits</hi> will thank him for a story that would ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>IT might have been expected from <hi>one,</hi> that hath trampled on the ashes of his <hi>Martyr'd Sovereign,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended and adored his <hi>Murtherers,</hi> stiled all our Kings a <hi>Succession</hi> of <hi>Usurpers,</hi> endeavour'd the extirpation of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and the planting a <hi>Democracy</hi> of <hi>Independents, Anabaptists, Fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And thus I think I have sufficiently <hi>chastised</hi> his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POLOGY, by which he thought he had secured him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self against all <hi>designs</hi> to <hi>represent</hi> him: <hi>this</hi> I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, for <hi>caution</hi> to those that might otherwise be in some <hi>danger</hi> of <hi>heeding</hi> him, and of being misled by his pretended zeal for <hi>Monarchy</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> into an ill opinion of the <hi>Royal Institution,</hi> which he <hi>maliciou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

'Tis <hi>true, personall</hi> matters in <hi>Controversies</hi> should, as much as is possible, be <hi>avoided,</hi> and I dislike <hi>them</hi> much; but M. <hi>Stubbe</hi> hath made them <hi>necessary</hi> in <hi>this</hi>; and the account of him which I am to give, will not be without its <hi>pleasure,</hi> since 'tis a <hi>description</hi> of a very <hi>strange A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal,</hi> and <hi>such a one</hi> as is seldom seen out of <hi>Africa,</hi> or the Country of <hi>Cannibals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53427:7"/>Having thus defeated M. <hi>Stubbe's excuses,</hi> it may be thought fit that I make <hi>one</hi> for my self: For the bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital of the <hi>abominable</hi> things he hath <hi>disgorged,</hi> cannot but raise a <hi>stench</hi> that is <hi>loathsom</hi> and <hi>offensive</hi>; but, I hope, it will be considered, that I could not have given <hi>sufficient caution</hi> against the <hi>malignity</hi> of <hi>this troubler</hi> of men, without <hi>opening</hi> those <hi>Ulcers,</hi> and letting the world see what <hi>filth</hi> and <hi>venome</hi> there is under the <hi>fairness</hi> of his <hi>pretences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any man think I have handled <hi>this</hi> Adversary with too much <hi>bitterness</hi> and <hi>severity,</hi> he seems to forget that I have to do with M. <hi>Stubbe; Russians</hi> and <hi>swaggering Hectors</hi> are not to be treated with <hi>gentleness</hi> and <hi>soft</hi> words; and, I know, should I deal with <hi>this Antagonist</hi> in a way of <hi>lenity</hi> and <hi>smoothness,</hi> it would <hi>incourage</hi> his <hi>insolence,</hi> and make him phancy that he is <hi>feared.</hi> I have therefore thought sit to express my self here with <hi>more smartness,</hi> than I do allow of towards men of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon civility and good manners; and 'tis not my <hi>passion,</hi> but <hi>judgment</hi> prompted me to it.</p>
            <p>And now, lest it should be suspected that my dealing so much with M. <hi>Stubbe</hi> hath <hi>infected</hi> me with the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>detraction,</hi> I shall next give him those acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that I think may be his <hi>due.</hi> I confess therefore that he is a man that hath READ; he was for some years <hi>Sub-librarian</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and <hi>so</hi> by his <hi>imployment</hi> was <hi>chained</hi> among the Books: from thence he got great <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>Titles</hi> and <hi>Indexes</hi>; and by <hi>that</hi> can, upon any occasion, let out a great <hi>apparatus</hi> of <hi>Authors,</hi> and fill his <hi>margin</hi> with <hi>Quotations: this</hi> must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and it is no small advantage for <hi>shew</hi> and <hi>vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory</hi>; and by this means he will seem to have the <hi>better</hi> of any man he shall oppose, among <hi>such</hi> as are not able, or not concerned to examine <hi>how</hi> he <hi>useth</hi> his <hi>Authors,</hi> and <hi>how</hi> he <hi>applies</hi> them. But whoever doth <hi>this,</hi> will find, that notwithstanding his pretence to great <hi>Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> he <hi>reads</hi> by <hi>Indexes,</hi> and only collects those passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges from Authors which he can suborn to serve his <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:53427:8"/>
purposes: That he <hi>understands not,</hi> or <hi>wilfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts</hi> the <hi>Writers</hi> he cites: That after he hath <hi>swaggered</hi> with their <hi>names,</hi> and recited several <hi>scraps</hi> out of their works, his <hi>Quotations prove nothing</hi> but that M. <hi>Stubbe</hi> is <hi>malicious</hi> and <hi>impertinent,</hi> and <hi>makes</hi> the <hi>sayings</hi> and <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi> he fights <hi>against:</hi> of all <hi>this,</hi> I have given <hi>speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> of proof in divers of the ensuing sheets; by which it will appear, that this confident man is one of the most <hi>notorious Impertinents</hi> that ever writ a Book.</p>
            <p>And whoever <hi>attentively</hi> considers his Writings, and observes the <hi>way</hi> of his <hi>Discourse,</hi> must needs see, that whatever he pretends to <hi>reading,</hi> he is extreamly <hi>defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive</hi> in <hi>judgment,</hi> and <hi>understands not</hi> the <hi>way</hi> of <hi>close, coherent reasoning:</hi> Nor indeed can it be <hi>expected</hi> from one of <hi>his temper</hi> of brain; his head is <hi>red-hot,</hi> and consequently his thoughts are <hi>desultory</hi> and <hi>flirting</hi>; so that he affirms <hi>suddenly</hi> whatever comes into his phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, not considering how it agrees with what he said before; what it makes for his purpose, or how it may be <hi>well proved.</hi> He hath not the <hi>patience</hi> to ponder any thing <hi>deeply,</hi> nor the <hi>judgment</hi> and <hi>staidness</hi> to weigh <hi>consequences</hi>; and therefore <hi>writes</hi> and <hi>speaks</hi> in a vein of infinite <hi>impertinence</hi> and <hi>inconsistency. This</hi> I may be permitted to say <hi>here,</hi> because I have proved it in the following <hi>Papers.</hi> And now what can such a mans <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Learning</hi> signifie? It may make him <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>troublesom, captious</hi> and <hi>censorious,</hi> but will never inable him to serve the world with any <hi>useful</hi> informations: Nor is any mans reading any further to be valued, than as it <hi>improves</hi> and <hi>assists</hi> his <hi>reason</hi>; where it doth not <hi>this,</hi> 'tis either a <hi>feather</hi> in a <hi>Fools cap,</hi> or a <hi>sword</hi> in a <hi>mad-mans hand</hi>; a <hi>vain glorious impertinence,</hi> or an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of mischief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I perceive my <hi>Preface</hi> begins to <hi>swell,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I only <hi>add</hi> further, That whereas M. <hi>Stubbe</hi> reports in several places of his Books, that the <hi>Virtuosi contributed</hi> to my <hi>PLUS ULTRA,</hi> I will acquit those Gentlemen from being concerned in the composure of a Discourse

            <p>'Tis a <hi>pretty artifice</hi> I observe in M. <hi>Stubbe,</hi> to intitle every thing any man doth in favour of the Royal Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, to <hi>that</hi> whole Body, or at least to a <hi>Club</hi> of the <hi>Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For I love not <hi>Sculking</hi> and <hi>base</hi> Assaults in the <hi>Dark.</hi> I had much rather be call'd to an Account for any thing I have written, before the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Judicious, than to be confuted in Corners, among those, whose Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are either <hi>prepossest</hi> or <hi>incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi>; This latter hath for some time been my hard Fate.</p>

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:53427:10"/>For after M. <hi>Crosse</hi>'s Fardel against me, was rejected by the Licensers both at <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>London</hi> for its <hi>incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Railing,</hi> and <hi>impertinence</hi>; He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to expose me among his Cronies and Confederates by the <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script</hi> Libel. He carrried it about from place to place, and like a <hi>Scotch Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,</hi> opened his Pack at each House in his Circuit: He told his Tales to every <hi>Country-Farmer,</hi> and acquainted every <hi>Mechanick</hi> with his mighty Deeds and Purposes: So that for a time, there was no other Subject handled on <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benches,</hi> and in <hi>Coffee-Houses,</hi> in all this Neighbourhood. Besides which Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, He pelted me with <hi>Doggerel Rhimes</hi> innumerable; and a pretended Answer to the <hi>Chuè Gazett</hi> was read privately to those that had a mind to hear such Stuff, and so I was <hi>confuted</hi>: But great Care was taken that I should not know in <hi>what,</hi> for fear I should <hi>spoil</hi> the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs,</hi> and write a <hi>second</hi> part of the <hi>Legends</hi> of the <hi>Disputer.</hi>

            <p>This I intend in a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>particular ANSWER</hi> to his Book against my <hi>PLVS VLTRA,</hi> and shall let this <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>Battels</hi> (who is used to triumph before he strikes a blow) see, that he hath <hi>nonplus'd</hi> me no where, but in his

               <hi>Title.</hi> But my Affairs will not permit me to fall on <hi>that</hi> work, so soon as I am willing you should have an Account of <hi>this Undertaker</hi>; and therefore I shall now send you a few <hi>general Remarques</hi> concerning the <hi>Author</hi> and his <hi>Work</hi>: By which you will perceive, that it is not at all to be wondred at, that he treats so many excellent Persons with such <hi>Insolence</hi> and <hi>Scorn,</hi> so many Taunts of <hi>Ignorance, Illiterateness,</hi> and what comes next; since I shall shew, that <hi>this</hi> is his <hi>constant, natural</hi> Style, and hath always been his <hi>use</hi> in his early Oppositions of some of the most famous men of our Nation: So that you are to reckon that the <hi>reproachful Characters</hi> he gives, import only, that the man is <hi>angry</hi>; and <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>illiterate</hi> in his Mouth and Pen signifie but <hi>one</hi> that is <hi>not</hi> of <hi>his mind,</hi> or at least not of <hi>that</hi> mind, which he hath a present Humour and Interest to oppose. And yet I must confess that after I heard of M. <hi>Stubb</hi>'s Intentions of falling on my Book, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected more <hi>Railing</hi> and greater <hi>Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence,</hi>

more <hi>opprobrious</hi> Names, and <hi>spightful</hi> Sayings; because I <hi>knew</hi> the <hi>man</hi> and his Genius: And though some perhaps can scarce apprehend a greater excess in <hi>these good Qualities,</hi> then are to be met in <hi>this</hi> Piece, yet I can very well conceive <hi>such,</hi> as are incomparably <hi>greater,</hi> having so lately been made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the <hi>Civilities</hi> of M. <hi>Cross,</hi> in comparison to whom, <hi>This</hi> Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary writes like a <hi>Christian</hi> and a <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>; and that you may see how much there is of <hi>these,</hi> in <hi>this</hi> Author, and judge of the <hi>other</hi> by Him, I shall now immediately give you the Account of M. <hi>Stubb,</hi> reserving that of M. <hi>Cross</hi> to another season.</p>
            <p>That I may proceed <hi>distinctly,</hi> I shall represent Him in (1.)

reflect upon those infinite Discourses he hath had in very publick places <hi>often,</hi> and sometimes in my hearing, from which a Character full enough might be drawn of him, (for I think it not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous or handsome to make them more publick than he hath done himself, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept I am unavoidably forced upon it) But I shall take all my Accounts of the <hi>Undertaker</hi> out of his <hi>publisht</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and give you him in his <hi>own</hi> Words, nakedly as they are, quoted to a Page.

            <p>ONE of the <hi>First</hi> of his Essays, while he was yet but a Youngster in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> was a <hi>DEFENCE</hi> of M. <hi>HOBBS</hi> against the Reverend Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and famous <hi>Geometry-Professor</hi> of that University.

            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:53427:15"/>And yet I must confess that when I compare <hi>this</hi> Adversary with my <hi>other</hi> Antagonist M. <hi>Cross,</hi> I think there are acknowledgments due to him, for the <hi>Reading,</hi> and <hi>shew</hi> of <hi>Learning,</hi> that I find in his Discourse; and I may say of it, as one did of an <hi>impertinent</hi> Disputer, that was very brisk and fluent in his Argument, <hi>Bene disputat, sed nihil ad rem.</hi> But the Papers of my <hi>other</hi> As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailant deserve not as much as <hi>this;</hi> For they contain <hi>nothing,</hi> but <hi>opprobrious</hi> Names, <hi>gross</hi> Falshoods, and <hi>contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible</hi> Puerilities; <hi>no Learning,</hi> nor any shew of <hi>any,</hi> but <hi>such,</hi> as a Boy of 18 would despise.</p>
            <p>Thus briefly, and in general of the Writings of <hi>this</hi> Aggressor: out of <hi>Them</hi> I now come to give you some more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Accounts of his <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi> And because I resolve to abstain from all Expressions that look <hi>like</hi> the <hi>Rhetorick</hi> and <hi>Civility</hi> of M. <hi>Cross,</hi> and his <hi>Champion</hi> M. <hi>Stubb,</hi> I shall not give those <hi>hard</hi> Names to the <hi>Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> I discover, that every man else will
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53427:16"/>
think they deserve: But only make a kind and sober Enquiry after some of the remarkable <hi>Virtues</hi> he discloseth in his Works. I shall only insist here on two.</p>
            <p>And because he tells his Reader in the <hi>first</hi> Page of the <hi>Preface</hi> to his <hi>Light shining out of Darkness,</hi> [Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the first] That <hi>HE IS ONE THAT DESIRES TO LIE LOW IN HIS OWN EYES,</hi> I shall begin these Enquiries by taking notice,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) OF his singular <hi>Modesty; This</hi> is exceeding eminent in every Leaf of his Writings: In his Attempts, while <hi>but</hi> a <hi>Boy,</hi> upon the Reverend Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> and M. <hi>Baxter</hi>; and now he hath made it <hi>more</hi> remarkable by his Assault upon the Royal Society His <hi>Majesties Institution,</hi> and an <hi>Assembly,</hi> consisting of Persons of the greatest <hi>Honour, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> while he is yet but a <hi>young Country Physician;</hi> as he styles himself in his Preface against my Book, <hi>Plus ultra:</hi> And above all, it is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53427:16"/>
what a <hi>modest</hi> man <hi>this</hi> is, in his <hi>early</hi> Oppositions of <hi>MONARCHY,</hi> and <hi>Proposals</hi> of a <hi>MODEL</hi> for the <hi>GOVERN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT</hi> of three Nations, and Extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those <hi>Antient Laws,</hi> which had had been <hi>made</hi> and <hi>confirmed</hi> by the Wisdom of <hi>so many Kings,</hi> and successive <hi>Parliaments,</hi> in his Impugnations of <hi>MINISTRY, VNIVERSITIES, CHVR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHES, HVMANE LEARNING,</hi> and <hi>all ORDERS,</hi> and <hi>CONSTITVTIONS</hi> whatsoever, as <hi>Popish</hi> and <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let us take a view of his singular <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Lowness</hi> in <hi>his own Eyes,</hi> in some <hi>Expressions</hi> in his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; I shall recite a few Instances among numerous others, which for Brevity I must omit, by which you may judge, how he excels in <hi>this Virtue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>first</hi> Page of his Book against Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> in <hi>Defence</hi> of M. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> He expresseth himself to his Friend in <hi>these</hi> words, <hi>I have pen'd a further Discourse upon that Subject, which you may suppress
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53427:17"/>
from going any further, if you find that my early Repute abroad doth not call for the Publication,</hi> nor the <hi>Applause</hi> of the <hi>Ingenious, whose Praises were the more to be regarded, because they were directed to the Piece which was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, not the Author that was concealed.</hi> It seems he had writ an Anonymous Book, which, he tells the World, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him an <hi>early Repute,</hi> and the <hi>Applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> and <hi>Praises</hi> of the <hi>Ingenious.</hi> Very <hi>modest!</hi> And as <hi>lowly</hi> is that <hi>other</hi> Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, p. 5. <hi>If I find the Doctor produce more Grammars against us, I will allow him two to one, and venture my Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation against his no Credit: Great Odds! M.</hi> Stubb'<hi>s Reputation,</hi> that <hi>early Reputation abroad</hi> against the <hi>no Credit</hi> of Dr. <hi>Wallis!</hi> He must needs be <hi>certain,</hi> that would lay such a Wager. Well! The <hi>Geometry-Professor</hi> of <hi>Oxford</hi> is a Person of <hi>no Credit,</hi> and the <hi>Young man</hi> of <hi>Christ-church attaqu'd</hi> and <hi>weakned</hi> it: This he tells us he had done, in his Preface, <hi>p.</hi> 3. He valiantly attaqu'd <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> and made it as <hi>weak,</hi> as Water:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53427:17"/>
And sooner he had done it, but for a good Reason; <hi>'Twas long,</hi> saith he, <hi>ere my Laughter upon the reading of Dr.</hi> W. <hi>would permit me to use a Pen,</hi> ibid. And what should the man do, while the <hi>Fit</hi> of <hi>Laughter</hi> was upon him? As soon as he <hi>could</hi> for <hi>Laughing,</hi> he assures us, he <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared</hi> for <hi>Triumph. And being then rather to proclaim my Victory, than to gain one, I supposed I might have a greater time to prepare for Triumph, than had been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise necessary to the Dispute,</hi> ibid. p. 3. Well! But what need of so much <hi>Triumph,</hi> and such <hi>Preparations</hi> for it, if <hi>this</hi> Adversary were so <hi>ridiculous</hi>? He tells us in the words that <hi>follow, Nor do I now go about to Triumph over the single Doctor, (The Conquest is too mean)</hi> no doubt modest <hi>Harry! But over all those whose Interest or Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance may lead them to approve his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, who are numerous at least; and since the Vogue of the People will have them deserving too, I have thought them worthy the Passion of thy affectionate Friend and Servant.</hi> So he concludes
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53427:18"/>
to the <hi>understanding</hi> Reader: But that Friend of his may ask, that since the <hi>Approvers</hi> of the Doctors Writings are <hi>numerous,</hi> and they have the <hi>Vogue</hi> of the People for <hi>deserving</hi> too; How should it come to pass that He is a Person of <hi>no Credit,</hi> as p. 5. and a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Adversary</hi>? as [p. 8. <hi>second Part.</hi>] If he had made his Address to the <hi>Courteous</hi> instead of the <hi>Vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Reader, some of <hi>that</hi> sort probably might not have observed this Fit of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulness: And he that <hi>doth,</hi> must pass such slips over, or he'l find work enough for his Patience on this Account, as well as others, in the Writings of the <hi>Vndertaker.</hi> But 'tis not my business to note any of <hi>these</hi> here; His Modesty and the <hi>Lowliness of his Mind,</hi> (for which he would have recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself to those <hi>meek</hi> ones of the <hi>Earth, Lambert</hi>'s <hi>Army,</hi> and the <hi>Committee</hi> of <hi>Safety</hi>) are my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Subject: of <hi>these</hi> but an Instance o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> two more.</p>
            <p>He tells us in his Preface to his Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53427:18"/>
on my Book, <hi>p.</hi> 5. That <hi>The Comical Wits,</hi> (so he pleaseth to call the <hi>Fellows</hi> of the Royal Society) were so <hi>alarm'd</hi> at the <hi>Specimen of his Animadversions on Dr.</hi> Sprat <hi>and M.</hi> Glanvill, that They <hi>imployed all their Artifices to divert him:</hi> Great Sir <hi>GVY!</hi> how <hi>that</hi> Host <hi>trembles</hi> before Thee! How do their Spirits <hi>fail,</hi> and their Courage <hi>sink</hi> at thy Summons! How They weakly fly to <hi>Artifices</hi> to put by thy <hi>formidable Force,</hi> when they have not <hi>strength</hi> to stand before it! Well may They fear <hi>that redoubted Arm</hi> that hath <hi>slain</hi> so many <hi>Monsters; Antichrist,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> his Limbs, <hi>Monarchy, Churches, Vniversities, Ministry,</hi> and the rest: <hi>This Pigmy</hi> Troop cannot stand under <hi>one</hi> Blow of thy more than <hi>Herculean</hi> Club.</p>
            <p>Therefore the <hi>Cowards, mean Spirits, pitiful Mechaniciens,</hi> (as with <hi>valiant</hi> Despight he calls them) endeavour to wave the Combat by <hi>disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Proceedings,</hi> ibid. contrary (it seems) to all <hi>generous</hi> Laws of <hi>Chivalry</hi>;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53427:19"/>
They <hi>treacherously design</hi> (he tells us) not <hi>only upon his Fortunes,</hi> but <hi>Life</hi>: They cannot be secure while He is above ground. Well! But he knows his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and assures us that <hi>They are at his Mercy; The Obligation</hi> (as he saith) <hi>would be lost in sparing</hi> them, He resolves therefore to take the <hi>daring Counsel;</hi> and though they should op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press him by <hi>treacherous</hi> power, it would be said, That he fell their <hi>Uictor</hi> and <hi>their Martyr,</hi> [ib. p. 5.] Thus dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Samson</hi> pluck'd the House upon the <hi>Philistims.</hi> And no doubt M. <hi>Stubb</hi> is as much a <hi>Victor,</hi> as he is like to be a <hi>Martyr.</hi> For, what a <hi>Conquerour</hi> is He in <hi>Title-Pages</hi> and <hi>Prefaces</hi>? With what <hi>ease</hi> doth he get Victories? <hi>Vidi, Vici</hi>; He only <hi>laught</hi> at Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares</hi> for <hi>Triumph,</hi> as soon as the Merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was over: He dispatch'd a <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> of <hi>Animadversions</hi> against Dr. <hi>Sprat,</hi> and M. <hi>Glanvill,</hi> and <hi>presently</hi> the <hi>Royal Society</hi> are <hi>at his mercy</hi>; and I, for my part, am reduced to a <hi>Non-plus</hi> in his <hi>first</hi> Sentence, and designed for a <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:53427:19"/>
to <hi>publick Obloquy,</hi> in the <hi>second</hi> leaf of his <hi>Preface.</hi> It seems he hath the Wind of <hi>publick Fame</hi> in a Bag, and can direct <hi>Reputation</hi> or <hi>Reproach</hi> as he pleaseth. The <hi>general Sense</hi> of Mankind depends upon his <hi>Pen,</hi> which is none of the <hi>common</hi> ones, to which from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth I am to be <hi>given up,</hi> as he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens, <hi>p.</hi> 2. Now I see with how much reason he saith, That <hi>the Expectation of all men was impatient to see his Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions,</hi> [Pref. p. 7.] No doubt 'twas that they might know what they were to judge of the <hi>Virtuosi.</hi> He hath at last <hi>obliged Mankind</hi> with them, as he promiseth to do by his <hi>Observations</hi> about <hi>Chocolata,</hi> [Disc. of <hi>Choc.</hi> Pref. p. last.] and now he expects without Question, that the <hi>Comical Wits</hi> should be <hi>odious to the Kingdom,</hi> as he tells us he designed to make them. [<hi>Non-plus,</hi> Pref. p. 4.] The Kingdom, 'tis like, will <hi>love</hi> and <hi>hate</hi> as he would have it. He gives the Stamp of <hi>odious</hi> or <hi>amiable,</hi> and the <hi>Character</hi> is <hi>indelible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, Sir, is a <hi>short</hi> Description of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53427:20"/>
the <hi>modest</hi> man, that was so <hi>low</hi> in his <hi>own Eyes,</hi> when he stood before his <hi>Patrons</hi> of the <hi>GOOD OLD CAVSE.</hi> And from <hi>this</hi> remarkable <hi>Virtue</hi> of his we may pass to an Enquiry about another as eminent, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(II.) HIS <hi>Civility</hi> and <hi>dutiful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour</hi> towards his <hi>Betters:</hi> of this He gives <hi>great</hi> Instances in his Expressions towards <hi>all sorts</hi> of <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours.</hi> Concerning our <hi>KINGS</hi> he saith, That <hi>Their whole Succession was a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Usurpation,</hi> [Pref. to the <hi>Good old Cause,</hi> p. 2.] Of the Glorious <hi>KING</hi> CHARLES the <hi>MARTYR</hi>; That <hi>All his evil Council did ride upon one Horse, ibid.</hi> And adds, That the <hi>Patriots</hi> of the <hi>Long Parliament</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my executed Iustice upon Him.</hi> [Vind. against M. <hi>Baxter,</hi> p. 59.] Our present <hi>SOVERAIGN</hi> he styles an <hi>Usurper,</hi> and mates him with <hi>Cromwel</hi> in the <hi>infamy</hi> of that Title; For speaking of the <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Tyrants Death,</hi> He saith, It was <hi>famous for the Vanquishing of one,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53427:20"/>
and the Death of an other Usurper.</hi> [against M. <hi>Baxt.</hi> p. 53.] And every one knows <hi>That</hi> was the third of <hi>September,</hi> the Day also of the Kings <hi>Final</hi> Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw at <hi>Worcester.</hi> And in his <hi>Letter</hi> to an <hi>Officer</hi> of the <hi>Army,</hi> p. 14. speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a <hi>Cloud</hi> out of the <hi>North,</hi> which (he saith) was <hi>more dreadful to tender Consciences, than the</hi> Romish <hi>Inquisition;</hi> He adds, That in comparison thereof, <hi>the Return of Charles Stuart and his Bishops would prove a moderate Desire:</hi> In which Expression he thought, no doubt, he had rais'd the <hi>Dreadfulness</hi> of <hi>that Cloud</hi> to the most <hi>Hyperbolical</hi> Height <hi>possible,</hi> and much beyond the <hi>Comparison</hi> with the <hi>Inquisition.</hi> And whether that may not go for a <hi>Civility</hi> to his <hi>Majesty,</hi> (since He is return'd by happy and miraculous Providence with his <hi>Bishops</hi>) which he prates of [p. 21. of his late Book against me] let the Reader judge. To set off the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages <hi>Aristotle</hi> had for the compiling of his <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Animals</hi>; he speaks of the <hi>greatness</hi> of <hi>Alexander,</hi> his <hi>Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:53427:21"/>
to effect his Purposes, his <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity</hi> in acknowledging Services, his <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> what was done and omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; And then our Author intimates That the <hi>Royal Society</hi> have not <hi>such</hi> a <hi>PATRON</hi> in the <hi>KING,</hi> as <hi>ARISTOTLE</hi> had in <hi>ALEXANDER</hi>: How much <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect</hi> and <hi>Affection</hi> to his Majesty was meant by <hi>this</hi> Comparison, let those think, that consider the approved <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty</hi> of this <hi>Defender</hi> of the <hi>Good old Cause.</hi>

            <p>And having spoken of his <hi>Civility</hi> to our <hi>KINGS,</hi> (if you do not like <hi>that</hi> sort) I may here acquaint you, that he had another kind for Sir <hi>Hen.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53427:21"/>
               <hi>I often communing with mine own Soul in private, use to parallel our Bondage under the</hi> Norman <hi>Yoke, and our Deliverance therefrom, to the Continuance of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> Israel <hi>in</hi> Aegypt, <hi>and their Escape at last from that slavish Condition.</hi> This put him in mind to compare <hi>our Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers</hi> (forsooth) to <hi>MOSES,</hi> and 'twas not, he saith, <hi>One</hi> Moses, <hi>But many il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious Personages, whose Memory</hi> (he prophesies) <hi>shall live, when that of</hi> Thrasybulus, Timoleon, Epaminondas, Brutus, Valerius, <hi>or any Worthies</hi> Greece <hi>or old</hi> Rome <hi>could ever boast of, shall cease to be mention'd.</hi> [against M. <hi>B.</hi> p. 3.] What a <hi>Seer</hi> was M. <hi>Stubb!</hi> Their <hi>Memories live,</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> no doubt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue as long as the <hi>Records</hi> of <hi>Tybourn:</hi> And till all Trading fail <hi>there,</hi> Those <hi>Patriots</hi> of the <hi>long Parliament</hi> and <hi>Army,</hi> who executed <hi>Iustice upon the late KING,</hi> shall never cease to be mention'd.

            <p>And of Sir <hi>H. Uane</hi> he saith, That <hi>not to have heard of him is to be a Stranger

in this Land; and not to honour and admire him, is to be an Enemy to all that is good and virtuous,</hi> [Vind. of Sir <hi>H.

            <p>And little less in his Opinion is due to M. <hi>Harrington</hi> for the <hi>Commonwealth-Model</hi> in his <hi>Oceana,</hi> of which, he saith, in the Preface to his <hi>Good old Cause,</hi> p. 16. <hi>I admire his Model, and am ready to cry out, as if it were the Pattern in the Mount.</hi> And [<hi>p.</hi> 26.] he declares his Judgment for the <hi>promoting</hi> M. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington</hi>'s <hi>Model, In the Praises whereof</hi> (saith he) <hi>I would enlarge, did I not think my self too inconsiderable</hi> (an humble Fit) <hi>to add any thing to those applauds, which the understanding Part of the World must bestow upon him,</hi> (They <hi>must</hi> and can <hi>not</hi> chuse, since M. <hi>Stubb</hi> hath profest to admire it) <hi>and which,</hi> as he goes on, <hi>though Eloquence it self should turn Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrist, he not only merits, but transcends.</hi> 'Tis pity but M. <hi>Stubb</hi> had made some

            <p>I shall now offer you some further Account of <hi>those</hi> of the <hi>First</hi> Sort. Dr.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53427:24"/>
               <hi>WALLIS</hi> you know, is a Person of <hi>great</hi> and <hi>deserved</hi> Fame for <hi>Learning</hi> both at <hi>home</hi> and <hi>abroad</hi>: upon that excellent man M. <hi>Stubb first</hi> fastned in a <hi>Defence</hi> of M. <hi>Hobbs</hi> against him; I had occasion before to touch some instances of his Courtships bestowed on this learned Doctor; <hi>then</hi> I promised <hi>more,</hi> and with the particular <hi>Quotations</hi> of <hi>those; This</hi> I intend now briefly.</p>
            <p>In the Preface He tells his Reader, That the Doctor is one, who hath <hi>so merited by his Scurrility and Obscenity, that his</hi> English <hi>Writings may become Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendixes to</hi> Pasquil'<hi>s Iests, or the merry Tales of Mother</hi> Bunch, <hi>p.</hi> 1. The <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> is one of his <hi>Comical Wits,</hi> no doubt. And <hi>p.</hi> 2. he saith, <hi>one of us two is grosly ignorant,</hi> viz. either Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> the <hi>man of no Credit,</hi> p. 5. or M. <hi>Stubb</hi> one of <hi>early Reputation abroad.</hi> p. 2. Let the understanding Reader judge which it is; and that he may not mistake, our Author kindly directs his Judgment, [p. 6.49. and second Part, p. 1.3.5.8.] In which and <hi>other</hi> places, he chargeth the Doctor with
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53427:25"/>
               <hi>Ignorance, Want</hi> of <hi>Learning, intolerable Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi> in the <hi>Principles of his Profession:</hi> So that the Reader, if he be not <hi>grosly blind,</hi> must needs see which of them two it is that M. <hi>Stubb</hi> thinks to be <hi>grosly ignorant.</hi> And further to express his <hi>Civility</hi> and favourable Opinion of the Doctor, he saith, <hi>He hath afforded us nothing hitherto, but Falsities and Falsifications,</hi> p. 5. calls him <hi>peevish Doctor,</hi> p. 15. <gap reason="foreign">

And he goes on to mind the Doctor of his <hi>Pride, Ambition,</hi> and <hi>Disgraceful</hi> Speeches against the <hi>Godly Party, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53427:25"/>
that Remnant</hi> the <hi>Army, which under the Conduct of the Lord of Hosts upheld the Cause,</hi> ibid.</p>
            <p>Thus briefly of some <hi>Civilities</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> the <hi>First</hi> of those <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Wits,</hi> whom M. <hi>Stubb</hi> undertook to make <hi>ridiculous</hi> and <hi>odious</hi> to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, (to speak in his Phrase.)</p>
            <p>Let us see next with what Ingenuity and Fairness he carried himself towards M. <hi>BAXTER</hi> in his Defence of Sir <hi>H. V.</hi> against Him. This Reverend Divine was another of those he resolved to <hi>sacrifice to publick Obloquy,</hi> as he hath done me, [Pref. of N. P.] But let us see what way he takes to do it; his <hi>old</hi> Method no doubt, and so we find it. Let us hear him <hi>Rhetoricate</hi> then; <hi>One that is no Scholar at all, not skilled in Latin, Greek, or Hebrew, not versed in Ecclesiastical History, or Philosophy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But a meer Glow-Worm in Literature, who borrowed his Light from the Darkness of the Night, and the Ignorance of those he converseth with.</hi> [p. 32, 33. of the Pref. to <hi>Good old Cause,</hi>] <hi>Whifler in Theology,</hi> p. 33.

And before I have done with him, I shall make him wish, he had taken the same Course, in reference to the <hi>Virtuosi.</hi> He saith, [p. 18. of his Vindication of Sir <hi>H.

in <hi>these</hi> following Words, <hi>Dare He boast unto the World, what time he spent in Impertinencies,</hi> viz.

And 'tis pretty to see how he chargeth M. <hi>Baxter</hi> with <hi>Ignorance</hi> in <hi>Syriack</hi> and <hi>Arabick,</hi> which, he saith, are of <hi>great Vse for the Vnderstanding the Scripture,</hi> [ibid. p. 18.] and yet implicitely <hi>affirms,</hi> [Quer. 13. of his Light out of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,] <hi>That the Knowledge of Tongues leads us to many Senses of Scripture, and to put our Trust in Man:</hi> and again, [Qu. 18.] That <hi>the first Christians were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant

of Humane Learning, and Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Authors,</hi> and <hi>that it was not only the Effect of</hi> Julian <hi>the Apostates Malice, but Christian Prudence, that went about to keep the People of God from reading Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Writers:</hi> And yet <hi>these</hi> two Books, speaking such <hi>contradictory</hi> things, bear date the <hi>same</hi> Year; onely indeed, the Designs were very <hi>different,</hi> and M. <hi>Stubb</hi> was to serve a <hi>divers Interest</hi> in them; in the one to recommend himself to the <hi>Quakers</hi> and other <hi>wild</hi> Fanaticks; and in the other to vent his <hi>Malice</hi> against M. <hi>Baxter</hi>: And things in <hi>his Divinity</hi> must be <hi>affirmed</hi> or <hi>denied,</hi> as there is occasion. He is still <hi>consistent</hi> with <hi>one</hi> Principle, <hi>Self</hi>; But never was yet <hi>steady</hi> to <hi>any other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides the <hi>Civilities</hi> mention'd, I might recite innumerable others; but I must hasten from this head: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of some few more briefly. He calls Sir <hi>K.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53427:27"/>
Authority of <hi>Pliny.</hi> He styles the excellent History of the <hi>R. S.</hi> a <hi>nonsensical and illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate History,</hi> p. 173. And <hi>Pr. p.</hi> 4. He saith, he observed <hi>the Tendency of it to be so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, that, if the first Provocation</hi> (viz. that which he had from my Book.) <hi>had made him angry, he was now become ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate,</hi> and he goes on, <hi>In that famed Work I encountred with so many illiterate Passages, that the Credit of our Nation seemed concern'd in the Refuting it</hi>; Yea, he adds, that the <hi>Interest</hi> of the <hi>present Monarchy,</hi> the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Emolument of each private Person</hi> was concerned; And when these were at stake, was it fit for M. <hi>Stubb</hi> to be silent?

He tells us this was done at a Person of Honour's Table, and that it was at the very Beginning of Dinner, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, in that the Gentleman usurp'd the Discourse <hi>instantly</hi>; So that we may judge that M. <hi>Stubb</hi>'s <hi>Teeth</hi> would not give his <hi>Tongue</hi> leave; But as soon as <hi>that</hi> was at Liberty, he paid the <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Opiniatour,</hi> p. 3. for <hi>usurping his Province.</hi> If M. <hi>Stubb</hi> had <hi>hated</hi> all <hi>Vsurpers,</hi> as he doth the <hi>Vsurpers of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53427:29"/>
Discourse,</hi> we had never had a <hi>Defence</hi> of the <hi>Good old Cause.</hi> But why should he be so much concerned about <hi>this sort</hi> of Usurpers? <hi>Their</hi> Discourse can no more be heard in the lurry of <hi>his,</hi> than a <hi>soft</hi> Voice <hi>can,</hi> amidst the <hi>Clutter</hi> and <hi>Noise</hi> of a <hi>Mill</hi>; So that he hath no need of the <hi>Wax</hi> and <hi>Wooll</hi> he prescribes against the <hi>buzze</hi> of the <hi>Prattle-boxes</hi>; his <hi>Tongue</hi> will better defend his <hi>Ears</hi> from <hi>that</hi> danger; (though I cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise that it will never expose <hi>them</hi> to <hi>other</hi> and worse Hazards) And he is never like to meet <hi>such</hi> an <hi>Vsurper</hi> of <hi>Discourse,</hi> as the <hi>Virtuoso</hi> at the Person of Honours Table <hi>did</hi>; except the Doctor of <hi>Warwick</hi> could meet <hi>Harry Stubb</hi> of <hi>Christ-church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have given some Account of the <hi>rare Civilities</hi> of the <hi>Courtly Anti-Virtuoso,</hi> and upon review of them, I cannot but wonder, that <hi>this</hi> man, who had so <hi>early a Reputation abroad,</hi> as he told us, and was so <hi>applauded</hi> by the <hi>ingenious,</hi> should sully his Fame by the Choice of such <hi>pitiful</hi> Adversaries: Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> was <hi>ignorant, grosly ignorant,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53427:30"/>
intolerably ignorant, ignorant in his own Profession:</hi> M. <hi>Baxter, no Scholar at all, not skill'd in Latin, Greek, or Hebrew, Ecclesiastical History, or Philosophy, a Whiffler in Theology, and Glow-Worm in Literature:</hi> Dr. <hi>Sprat</hi>'s History, <hi>Illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate and Nonsensical</hi>; The <hi>Virtuosi, Prattle-boxes,</hi> and <hi>Ignoramus's</hi>; and I, <hi>ignorant</hi> of <hi>every</hi> thing.</p>
            <p>What means this Man of Renown to choose out such <hi>despicable</hi> Adversaries? Why doth he disparage his <hi>Puissance</hi> by imploying it against such <hi>feeble</hi> Foes? what poor Quarry are these for such a Noble Bird of Prey? He told us, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, that it was Zeal for the <hi>Cause</hi>; and now 'tis the <hi>Interest</hi> of <hi>Monarchy, Protestant Religion,</hi> the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Vniversities,</hi> that have engaged this <hi>publick-spirited</hi> man to so great Condescensions; and how much reason we have to believe, that <hi>these</hi> were the <hi>true</hi> Motives to his Assaults, we shall see by and by.</p>
            <p>I shall now shut up this Head by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice, what a fit <hi>Second</hi> this is

for M. <hi>Cross:</hi> They are <hi>nobile par,</hi> and extremely <hi>alike</hi> in sundry particulars of their <hi>Genius</hi> and <hi>Performances</hi>; only it must be confess'd, that M. <hi>Stubb</hi> hath as much the <hi>more Learning,</hi> as he is guilty of the <hi>less Scurrility</hi>; And indeed the <hi>Civilities</hi> of <hi>this</hi> kind, which the <hi>Physician</hi> of <hi>Warwick</hi> hath bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>all</hi> his Adversaries, are not <hi>equal</hi> to <hi>those</hi> my other Antagonist hath libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally given <hi>me</hi> singly. And though I pass immediately from looking over the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection</hi> of <hi>Complements</hi> I have presented you from M. <hi>Stubb,</hi> yet when I cast my eyes from it upon M. <hi>Crosses</hi> Papers, (a Transcript of which I have) I cannot choose but bless my self, and cry out in astonishment. For there is scarce a word of <hi>Reproach</hi> in the <hi>Dictionary,</hi> but he hath found it for me; yea he hath made divers that are <hi>span-new,</hi> to serve his purpose, and ventured upon <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risms</hi> to miscall me by, when all the <hi>usual</hi> Names of Disparagement and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy were spent.

[Pref. 6.] M. <hi>Marchamont Stubb</hi> is the <hi>PILLAR</hi> of <hi>MONARCHY,</hi> and the <hi>PATRIOT</hi> of <hi>PROTESTANT Religion</hi>; But you must not ask how long he hath been of this <hi>Loyal</hi> and <hi>Religious</hi> Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? He hath no longer a <hi>Concern</hi> for Sir <hi>H.

               <hi>Interest</hi> of the <hi>present Monarchy,</hi> and the <hi>Church of England</hi> are <hi>now</hi> the <hi>Cause,</hi> the <hi>glorious Cause,</hi> (and next to the <hi>Good old one</hi>) no doubt the most <hi>glorious</hi> that ever was.

            <p>HOW like it is (1.) that the <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest</hi> of <hi>Monarchy</hi> should be one ground of M. <hi>Stubb</hi>'s Quarrel with the <hi>Virtuosi</hi> we have seen already; or if it do not yet fully appear from what hath been recited before, give me leave to propose to your further Consideration a Paragraph of <hi>his</hi> in the Beginning of his <hi>Vindication</hi> of Sir <hi>H.

               <hi>The Age</hi> (saith he) <hi>wherein we live, hath been all Miracles</hi>; and <hi>the coming forth of the Woman out of the Wilderness hath been attended with so many Wonders, that a pious Heart can never want im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in its Contemplation. We have seen, and our Eyes bear witness of the Actings of our God, the overturning of a Monarchy setled upon the Foundation and Vsage of many hundreds of Years, streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened by what Humane Policy could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to its Establishments, and what of Buttress a complying Clergy could assist it with out of the Pulpit; Yet have we seen a Change so brought about by our Iehovah, that he may in extraordinary Acknowledgments be proclaimed wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Counsellour, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, Prince of Peace: We have seen the most glorious Cause in the World, accompanied with no less Success, and the Lord in his Mercy to us, and Iustice to them, hath bound our Kings in Chains, and Nobles in Fetters of Iron, such as wherewith they had formerly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest the good People of this Land. This
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53427:33"/>
Honour have all his Saints,</hi> (Psal. 149.9.) <hi>Vengeance hath he returned upon their heads, and their own Shame hath cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. The true anointed ones of the Lord have appeared, for their sakes hath he rebuked Monarchs, and the former have repeated the Fruits of that Holiness, and Sacriety, whereunto the latter vainly pretended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>this</hi> Strain he goes on, in imitation of the <hi>reformed</hi> Style of <hi>those</hi> Times, which is not <hi>Canting,</hi> but the <hi>holy</hi> Language of the <hi>anointed ones,</hi> for whose sake <hi>our King was bound in Chains, and our Nobles in Fetters of Iron.</hi> And are we not to believe that <hi>this Anointed Rumper</hi> is a <hi>Zealot</hi> for the Interest of the <hi>present Monarchy</hi>? We have his <hi>word</hi> for't, and he hath told <hi>me,</hi> that he can say <hi>more</hi> for <hi>Monarchy</hi> than <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Virtuosi:</hi> No doubt! It would be very much, if M. <hi>Stubb</hi> could not say more for any thing than the <hi>Ignoramus's.</hi> He knows the man, that useth to brag, what he can <hi>say</hi> for <hi>MAHOMET,</hi> and what an Inclination he hath to write the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53427:33"/>
Life of that <hi>Brave Fellow</hi>; And if <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism</hi> were among us, I know where the <hi>Alcoran</hi> would have a <hi>Defender,</hi> and one that can <hi>say</hi> as much for it, as for <hi>Monarchy,</hi> or the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> if he may be credited himself; but of that no more now.</p>
            <p>We have seen some things whereby we may judge, how dear the <hi>Interest</hi> of <hi>Monarchy</hi> is to our <hi>Anti-Virtuoso</hi>; and how much Reason we have to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>that</hi> to be one ground of his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with the Royal Society.</p>
            <p>LET us inquire next, (2.) how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable it is, that he should be kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led against them by the Consideration of the <hi>Church of England</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a time, you know, when the <hi>Church of England</hi> was in a <hi>worse</hi> Condi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53427:34"/>
things were fallen under their destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Power. What did this <hi>pious Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatour</hi> of the <hi>Church of England</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> in that <hi>unhappy</hi> season? No doubt, his <hi>Zeal burnt like fire</hi>; and he was <hi>sensible then,</hi> as he is <hi>now,</hi> [Pref. p. 4.] <hi>that he ought not to be silent.</hi> Then it was that his <hi>Light</hi> broke out of <hi>Darkness,</hi> that disclosed Truths little less <hi>admirable</hi> than <hi>those</hi> Sir <hi>H.

            <p>Q. 1. <hi>Whether there be any certain or peculiar Name in the New Testament, that signifies a Minister? or any Name whence an Office may be convincingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd?

            <p>Q. 2. <hi>Is it not an Act of Arrogance in them, who would be the Apostles Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors in ordinary, —ordinary Ambassadors from the most High, to assume a Name of greater Latitude than that of Apostle, or Ambassador extraordinary? or at least is it not as absurd, as if the Ant should assume the single Name of Animal; and the Lacquey that of Servant.</hi> p. 3, 4.</p>

            <p>Q. 31. <hi>Whether it were not an Act of Superstition in former times to build Churches and Chappels in the Form or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion of a Cross? whether it were not a Sin of the like Nature in Antient Times to build their Churches East and West, that so the People might bow and pray towards the East? — And whether both these Superstitions have not been renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and practised lately in one of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Colleges of</hi> Oxford, <hi>viz.</hi> Brasen-Nose College, as in the Margin. <hi>p.</hi> 139.</p>

and a Tithe-receiving Ministry, <hi>(whom yet not long ago they stiled abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable) and Parish Priests, and their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour toward the Quakers in</hi> Oxon <hi>(agreeable to a persecuting rather than a persecuted Spirit) sufficiently acquit them from having any Affinity with those other Pretious Souls?</hi> p. 156.</p>
            <p>Q. 53. <hi>Whether it be a peculiar Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of our modern Anabaptists and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, that they will not swear, no, not before a Magistrate? or whether it were not an Opinion of the</hi> Waldenses <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors of the Protestants</hi>? p. 166.</p>
            <p>What sort of Persons <hi>these Queries</hi> were intended to gratifie, 'tis very <hi>easie</hi> to apprehend. But lest those Friends he had a mind to <hi>make,</hi> should be so dull as not to perceive it; He writes an express <hi>Apology</hi> for the <hi>Quakers</hi> beginning at <hi>p.</hi> 55. continued to <hi>p.</hi> 92. In which he tells us, that he <hi>durst not condemn the Quakers, whether they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove openly or walk naked through the Streets, denouncing Woes and Menaces, p.</hi> 91. and he goes on; <hi>It is a sufficient
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53427:38"/>
Argument for me, that what God bids is not undecent, nor do they any thing for which they have not a like Example, and (possibly) resembling Commands. Did not the Protestant Martyrs so disturb the Popish Priests, as the present Ministers are disturbed? and that when the Laws were against them? Yea many of the first Christians dealt so with the Heathens and their Priests.</hi> ib. And again, p. 92. <hi>If</hi> Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zac <hi>or</hi> Rutgersius <hi>had written his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Antient Christian, the Quaker would not have stood in need of an Apology.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether <hi>these</hi> Passages, and the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course were <hi>more</hi> intended to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the <hi>Quakers,</hi> or to make the <hi>first Christians, Protestants,</hi> and <hi>Martyrs, contemptible</hi> and <hi>ridiculous</hi> by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison; Let those that know M. <hi>Stubb,</hi> and have ever heard him discourse about <hi>Religion, judge.</hi> For my part I am <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</hi> 'Tis a <hi>pleasant</hi> Passage and to the <hi>same</hi> purpose, which I meet in his <hi>Vindication</hi> of Sir <hi>Hen. Vane,</hi> p. 36. He tells M. <hi>Baxter</hi> that it was <hi>ignorantly

            </p>
            <p>You may please to mark that he speaks not of any <hi>particular Opinions</hi> of M. <hi>Baxter</hi> and the <hi>Assembly,</hi> which have less to be said for them out of <hi>primitive</hi> Antiquity, than the <hi>Quakers,</hi> but of their <hi>Religion.</hi> And when M. <hi>Stubb</hi> hath <hi>proved</hi> what he hath here <hi>Avowed,</hi> men are like to have as <hi>good</hi> an Opinion of <hi>Christianity,</hi> as he can <hi>wish:</hi> And how good a one <hi>that</hi> is, I am loth to call in the <hi>Vouchee</hi> he cites for M. <hi>Cross,</hi> viz. <hi>general Fame,</hi> to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie.

of Darkness</hi>; and <hi>since,</hi> in his <hi>Account</hi> of <hi>Greatarick,</hi> he gives hint enough of the <hi>Degree</hi> of his <hi>Faith. Christ Iesus,</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> appeal continually to their <hi>Works,</hi> those <hi>miraculous ones</hi> they performed, as evidencing the <hi>Divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of their <hi>Commission,</hi> and the <hi>Truth</hi> of their <hi>Doctrines</hi>; and M. <hi>Stubb</hi> tells us, [p. 10.] <hi>That all Religions have had their real Miracles</hi>; and <hi>so</hi> let them <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,</hi> or <hi>fight</hi> it out as they can, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles must be tried by Truth, not Truth by Miracles,</hi> [ibid.] But how the <hi>Truth</hi> shall be <hi>tried,</hi> viz. that of a <hi>Divine Commission,</hi> or <hi>Authority:</hi> 'tis not for the Interest of one of <hi>his Principles,</hi> or rather of <hi>his no Principles,</hi> to tell us.

M. <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arick</hi> did <hi>things miraculous,</hi> [p. 8.] and <hi>these</hi> he performed by the <hi>Temperament</hi> and <hi>Composure of his Body,</hi> [p. 11.] So that <hi>Healing Miracles</hi> are the <hi>Effects of

the Effluvia of a particular Ferment,</hi> [p. 11.] And <hi>so</hi> Christ Jesus shewed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of <hi>Divinity</hi> in <hi>curing Diseases</hi> by his <hi>Touch.</hi> Yea, M. <hi>Greatarick</hi> is <hi>mated</hi> with <hi>Him,</hi> and the <hi>Apostles,</hi> [p. 26.] <hi>He did the things that never man did, but Christ and his Apostles; He</hi> cured Diseases by the <hi>Temperament</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure of his Body,</hi> [ut sup.] but no man ever did <hi>so</hi> besides; only the <hi>Son</hi> of God, and his <hi>Disciples</hi> had the Priviledge. And yet [p. 10.] <hi>this</hi> in express Words is <hi>plainly contradicted</hi>; for we hear there of others that did the same things with <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> and M. <hi>Greata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, The</hi> Alexicaci, Salutatores, <hi>or</hi> Bensedevios, <hi>that cure by anointing with Spittle, and by breathing and stroaking of the Patient.</hi> [p. 10.] <hi>And in</hi> Turky <hi>also and</hi> Africk <hi>they have Persons of the like Qualifications,</hi> [ibid.] But 'tis nothing for M. <hi>Stubb</hi> to affirm <hi>Contradictions,</hi> and I wish <hi>that</hi> were the <hi>worst</hi> could be justly laid to his Charge; I have a great deal more to say of his <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> to <hi>Religion,</hi> which I keep for a

He tells us, p. 15. of his Book against my <hi>Plus Vltra,</hi> That <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet taking advantage of the Brutal Lives, and Ignorance of the Catholicks depending upon the Patriarch of</hi> Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, <hi>did advance the Sect of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> called <hi>Mahometans</hi>: I wish some do not think that a certain <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> is a <hi>Christian</hi> by the same Figure as are those <hi>Disciples</hi> of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> If a man of Learning, and tolerably in his Wits endeavour to make the <hi>first Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, Martyrs,</hi> and <hi>Reformers</hi> like the <hi>Quakers</hi> in their <hi>Opinions</hi> and <hi>Deportment,</hi> He cannot be supposed primarily to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign the <hi>Crediting</hi> those <hi>distracted En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasts,</hi> but to vilifie all <hi>Christians,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept some of M. <hi>Stubb</hi>'s sort called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans</hi>; and our <hi>Defender</hi> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion knows well enough that the <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> he alledgeth to prove those sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brain'd People to be <hi>like</hi> all the <hi>best Christians,</hi> will prove <hi>as much,</hi> that the best Christians were like <hi>Them</hi>; and so a more <hi>desperate</hi> Enemy than the

               <hi>Quakers</hi> is gratified: How far he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>this,</hi> let those conjecture, who have heard of his Kindness and Concern for M. <hi>Hobbs:</hi> And how far he designs the promoting the <hi>Interest</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Church of England,</hi> let the most <hi>charitable</hi> man alive judge upon the whole.</p>
            <p>I, but (3.) he tells us how much he is for <hi>School-Divinity,</hi> and how far some <hi>great matters</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it; we derive great <hi>Benefits</hi> from <hi>Controversal Divinity,</hi> for the <hi>Quieting the Conscience,</hi> and <hi>Convincing</hi> our <hi>Adversaries</hi>; and whoever hath any <hi>sense</hi> of these must <hi>detest the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise of M.</hi> Glanvill, [<hi>Non Plus,</hi> p. 1.] This <hi>He did</hi> because he had a Value for the <hi>Peace</hi> of his <hi>Conscience,</hi> which is to be <hi>setled</hi> by <hi>School-Divinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how different from this was his Opinion of it, when he writ against M. <hi>Baxter, Then</hi> School-Divinity was <hi>apt to create everlasting Disputes rather than Rest, and made no part of the Rest

of the Primitive, whether Christians, or Antichristians</hi>; these are his Words, [p. 18.] M. <hi>Stubb</hi> had another way to quiet his Conscience at <hi>that</hi> time, but now <hi>School-Divinity</hi> is the only <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas in the same first Page of his Book against me, he tells us, The <hi>Distinction of the Trinity, of Essence, and Personality, the Hypostatical Vnion of the two Natures in our Saviour, and the meritoriousness of his Death (which depends thereupon) are undermined with School-Divinity.</hi> In that he writ against M. <hi>Baxter,</hi> he saith of it, That <hi>it is an upstart Study, unknown to the purer times, model'd and profess'd by that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which now manageth the Inquisition, and was at first erected for the suppressing the Truth in the Albigenses</hi>; [p. 13.] M. <hi>Stubb</hi> in his last Book greatly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauds <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> if he can find any <hi>Distinctions</hi> in that Learning to solve his <hi>own Contradictions,</hi> he shall have my Vote for the greatest <hi>Metaphysician</hi> in the World.

adds, [<hi>may not one upon the like Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction speak as irreverently of Oxford or Cambridge?</hi>] He cites <hi>Melancthon</hi> further calling the <hi>Vniversities</hi> the <hi>Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of Lies, Priests, Monks and School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; Pharisees and Sadducees,</hi> and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Epithete of <hi>wicked</hi> to <hi>School-Divinity,</hi> [ibid.] And as the Articles of <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> he gives us <hi>these,</hi> 1. <hi>That Scholastical Divinity is a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understanding the Holy Scripture and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and hath exiled us from the sincere and true Divinity.</hi> (2.) <hi>When the School or mock-Divinity began, then was the Divinity of the Cross of Christ rendred of no effect, and all things became perverted.</hi> (3.) <hi>It is now almost</hi> 300 <hi>Years since the School-Divines have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the Scriptures, to the incomparable Detriment of the Church.</hi> [p. 95.] To this he annexeth <hi>Melancthon's Apology</hi> for <hi>Luther</hi> in Opposition to the Censure of the <hi>Sorbonists</hi> against those Articles, containing much to the same purpose, spoken with all Contempt and Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence imaginable against <hi>that Divinity</hi>;

In which he saith, that if <hi>once it be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, there is nothing safe, nothing sound in the Church of God, The Gospel is obscured, Faith extinguish'd, Free Will and good Works introduced, and instead of professing Christianity we become not Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of the Law, but Adherents of</hi> Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle.— [p. 96.] M. <hi>Stubb</hi> concludes <hi>their Testimonies</hi> thus, <hi>Believe it, Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if thou art of this judgment, thou hast the most glorious Martyrs, the most renowned Christians, and as Learned Men as any to defend thee,</hi> [ibid.] And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his <hi>Query</hi> is, <hi>p.</hi> 95. <hi>Whether School-Divinity be not a novel thing, slighted and condemned by Learned and Godly men in all Ages since it was first intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced?</hi> If it <hi>were not,</hi> in M. <hi>Stubb</hi>'s Opinion it <hi>deserved</hi> to <hi>be so,</hi> for he calls it the <hi>Iargon</hi> of the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> in his Preface against Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> p. 2. where also he tells us of the <hi>Burles<expan>

Aristotle</hi> a <hi>Demi-god,</hi> a <hi>Hero, Prince</hi> of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> a <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Parts, Founder</hi> of <hi>Arts, Greatest</hi> of <hi>Men!</hi> O the <hi>Hogs, Drunkards, Vain Eablers, Dolts, Pot-Companions, Haters of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> that <hi>explode</hi> and throw off <hi>Aristotle!</hi> O the <hi>Madness</hi> of one that writ against <hi>Aristotle,</hi> against whom no <hi>sober</hi> Person ever writ, except he were a <hi>mad-man!</hi> Here is one that writ against <hi>Aristotle,</hi> what <hi>Impudence</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> will he stick at that writ against <hi>Aristotle</hi>? Are not these, Sir, <hi>strong Arguments,</hi> and is not <hi>Aristotle</hi> well defended? This I assure you is the Sum of what M. <hi>Cross</hi> saith for him, and the Reasonings of his Book throughout are of the same sort. I have not pick'd <hi>these</hi> Passages, as an <hi>Instance</hi> of <hi>ridiculousness</hi> to expose him, but took them up in my way, for a little Mirth sake, and to give you a taste of this Authors <hi>way</hi> of <hi>arguing,</hi> which is every where the same. And I have done it the rather, because the Learned Dr. <hi>Casaubon</hi> in his <hi>Letter to Dr.</hi> du Moulin <hi>about my PLVS VLTRA,</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:53427:56"/>
accuseth me [p. 7.] of <hi>reproaching my Adversary for his Love to, and Esteem of Aristotle</hi>; By <hi>this</hi> I would let that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend man see, that it is not my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries Love and Respect to <hi>Aristotle</hi> I deride; but the <hi>ridiculous Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of his <hi>fond</hi> Admiration, which he sufficiently discovered in that Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that was the Occasion of my Book.</p>
            <p>But enough of M. <hi>Stubb</hi> and M. <hi>Cross</hi> as to <hi>this</hi> particular; 'Tis evident enough that the <hi>former</hi> hath not <hi>that</hi> Kindness for <hi>Aristotle</hi> he pretends, to serve his Designs against the <hi>modern</hi> Philosophers; and the <hi>other</hi> can say nothing on his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, more than what <hi>Freshmen</hi> use to talk of that <hi>new great</hi> Name they are taught to <hi>admire;</hi> whatever Love he hath for Him.</p>
            <p>And now as to what concerns the <hi>modern EXPERIMENTAL PHILO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOPHERS,</hi> I dare say they are slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered much by those their Adversaries, that represent them as such Enemies to <hi>Aristotle</hi>; For I know <hi>They</hi> have a
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53427:56"/>
               <hi>due</hi> Esteem of him, and allow Him an <hi>eminent</hi> place among the wise Men of Antient times; They acknowledge the helps he hath afforded us, and pay Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects to his Writings, as they do to <hi>those</hi> of other <hi>venerable</hi> Authors; They <hi>refuse</hi> not, nor <hi>discourage</hi> the reading of his Books, nor do they reject any of his Discoveries, that may aid us in the Uses of Knowledge or Life; yea, they <hi>embrace</hi> them <hi>cheerfully,</hi> and are glad when any useful Truth hath <hi>such</hi> an <hi>Authority</hi> to recommend it. Thus much I dare undertake for <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Philosophers</hi> of the <hi>Practical</hi> way, of whom I have any Knowledge. But to make <hi>Aristotle</hi> a <hi>Dictator</hi> in Philosophy, and to give him an <hi>absolute Empire</hi> over our minds; to admire him, as if in him were hid all the Treasures of <hi>Natural Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and to be <hi>scrupulous in acknowledging that he was ignorant of any thing in Nature,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Casaubon</hi> saith <hi>Fabricius</hi> was, [in his Reflections on my <hi>Plus Vltra.</hi>] such Fondnesses as <hi>these,</hi> those Philosophers by no means
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53427:57"/>
approve, but look on them as extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>prejudicial</hi> to the <hi>Advance</hi> of <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> and the <hi>Respect</hi> that is due to other <hi>excellent</hi> Authors both of <hi>elder</hi> and <hi>later</hi> times.</p>
            <p>And I think by their modest Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>that Philosopher,</hi> they rather secure the <hi>just</hi> Praise and Regard to <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s <hi>Authority</hi> that is his <hi>due,</hi> than any way <hi>diminish</hi> it. For those that raise the Commendations of any man much beyond the <hi>Proportion</hi> of his <hi>Merit,</hi> and lay <hi>more</hi> Stress upon his <hi>Authority,</hi> than it will bear, do indeed give an occasion to the <hi>Contempt</hi> of <hi>such</hi> an <hi>over-valued</hi> Person, and the <hi>degrading</hi> him <hi>below</hi> that Respect, which his worth might claim: So that in earnest those <hi>doting</hi> men that talk such <hi>childish, incredible</hi> things of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> as I lately <hi>quoted</hi> from M. <hi>Cross,</hi> are his <hi>real</hi> Enemies, and expose him to Scorn and Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whereas the <hi>modern</hi> Philosophers, who give him <hi>just,</hi> but <hi>less excessive</hi> and <hi>flaunting</hi> Applauses, do more <hi>really</hi> serve the Interest of his <hi>Name;</hi> And
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53427:57"/>
what I particularly, have writ against Him, hath been designed <hi>chiefly,</hi> to <hi>lessen</hi> the <hi>Hyperbolical</hi> Admirations of the <hi>little enslaved</hi> Sectators; not to <hi>discourage</hi> any from the <hi>Study</hi> of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> or a <hi>modest va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue</hi> of his Authority. And that my Sense of Him and his Writings was the <hi>same then,</hi> that I declared but now, to be the <hi>experimental</hi> Philosophers Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in reference to <hi>that Philosopher,</hi> may be largely seen in my <hi>Defence</hi> of the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of <hi>Dogmatizing</hi> against that <hi>famous</hi> Adversary the <hi>Learned Albius,</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, <hi>p.</hi> 7. I have spoken there to the <hi>same</hi> purpose; but 'tis too much for my Laziness to transcribe.</p>
            <p>AND now, Sir, methinks, upon the Review of the whole it seems to me very pretty, that <hi>one,</hi> who labour'd so <hi>industriously,</hi> and <hi>inveighed</hi> so <hi>bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly</hi> against <hi>Monarchy, Ministry, Churches, Universities, Aristotle,</hi> and <hi>all Humane Learning,</hi> when <hi>some</hi> of <hi>these</hi> were <hi>actually</hi> overthrown; and All in imminent <hi>Danger</hi> of <hi>Ruine;</hi> that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53427:58"/>
put on the <hi>Fanatical Vsurpers</hi> (that need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no Spur) by gross, canting <hi>Flatteries</hi> of <hi>Them</hi>; and deadly, <hi>malicious Reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> and <hi>Oppositions</hi> of those great concerns of the Kingdom, to <hi>complete</hi> the <hi>Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> They had <hi>begun;</hi> That <hi>this man,</hi> I say, should talk, as if he were the only <hi>zealous</hi> Person for the Interest of <hi>Monarchy, Religion, Vniversities,</hi> and <hi>old Learning,</hi> and the only <hi>Patriot</hi> that could <hi>defend</hi> them, is a <hi>Confidence</hi> more than <hi>usual</hi>; and <hi>such,</hi> as very well <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes</hi> M. <hi>Stubb.</hi> And on the other hand, 'Tis as pleasant to hear <hi>this</hi> Writer representing a <hi>Society,</hi> that is a <hi>Royal Institution,</hi> and consists of a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the most <hi>loyal Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi>; and several of the most <hi>venerable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> of the <hi>Church, Archbishops, Bishops,</hi> and divers other <hi>Ecclesiastical Governours,</hi> and men of Eminence among the <hi>Clergy</hi>; I say, 'tis very fine, to hear M. <hi>Stubb</hi> setting out such an <hi>Assembly</hi> as an <hi>Enemy</hi> to <hi>Monarchy, Religion, Vniversities,</hi> and <hi>Learning</hi>: And we must <hi>believe</hi> upon the word of the <hi>Anti-Virtuoso,</hi> That a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53427:58"/>
great part of <hi>that</hi> Body are driving on Designs <hi>destructive</hi> to the Interests of <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom;</hi> and that the <hi>Loyal</hi> and <hi>Religious</hi> men of the <hi>ROYAL SOCIETY</hi> are so dull as not to perceive it, while the <hi>more sagacious</hi> Doctor of <hi>Warwick</hi> sees those <hi>dreadful</hi> Projects clearly, and therefore cannot be <hi>silent,</hi> but must warn the Nation of the Danger.</p>
            <p>Upon the Consideration of the whole Procedure, one would think that M. <hi>Stubb</hi> had so great an Ambition to gain the <hi>Applauses</hi> of the <hi>envious</hi> and <hi>ignorant</hi> (who are glad to see any thing that is worthy railed at and opposed) that for their sake, he is resolved (yet <hi>further</hi>) to expose himself to the <hi>Scorns</hi> of the <hi>sober</hi> and <hi>judicious.</hi> And really he writes at <hi>that</hi> rate, as if he were to <hi>defie</hi> the <hi>intelligent</hi> part of Mankind; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd only to be <hi>read</hi> by those that would <hi>believe any thing</hi> he said at a venture, because he writes <hi>against</hi> the <hi>Virtuosi.</hi> The <hi>Truth</hi> of this <hi>Censure</hi> will appear, when I come to my <hi>particular</hi> Remarques upon his Book; which I
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53427:59"/>
shall presently do, when I have taken a little notice of His other Designs, which are yet behind, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO <hi>represent</hi> the <hi>Uirtuosi</hi> as <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous</hi> and <hi>odious to the Kingdom;</hi> and to <hi>sacrifice</hi> me to <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Obloquy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To effect the <hi>former,</hi> He clapt his <hi>own Cap</hi> on the <hi>Virtuosi,</hi> and calls them <hi>Prattle-boxes,</hi> and then without any more ado, They are <hi>ridiculous:</hi> He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes them by the <hi>other</hi> part of his <hi>own Character,</hi> as Persons of <hi>irreligious</hi> and <hi>dangerous</hi> Inclination, and then they must be <hi>odious.</hi> And when the <hi>Virtuoso-Mastix</hi> hath proved that <hi>these</hi> are not <hi>Complements,</hi> but that his <hi>Comical Wits</hi> are so <hi>really</hi> like <hi>Himself</hi>; all men, no doubt, will say, that They are as he designed to represent them.</p>
            <p>But if M. <hi>Stubb</hi> be no better at ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Characters,</hi> than he is at giving <hi>Names,</hi> the <hi>Virtuosi,</hi> I doubt, will leave him <hi>without</hi> their Company, to enjoy the <hi>Honours</hi> he projects for them:
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53427:59"/>
For why of all things, must they be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Comical Wits,</hi> I trow? How came this to ramble into the mans head? Of all the Names that <hi>courtly</hi> M. <hi>Cross</hi> bestowed on me, there is scarce any that suits less; And yet now I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 'tis not improbable but that M. <hi>Stubb</hi> might borrow <hi>this</hi> from <hi>that</hi> great Repository of Titles; For that <hi>Master</hi> of Ceremonies <hi>calls me,</hi> and all things I do, at every turn, <hi>Romantick</hi>; And when he had studied a long time to know what I was good for, at last he finds <hi>this</hi>; that I might be capable of <hi>serving a Stage</hi>; Hence 'tis like his Friend took the hint, and the <hi>Virtuosi</hi> are presently dub'd the <hi>Comical Wits;</hi> and the <hi>Tres-haute</hi> and <hi>tres-agreeable Comediants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it may be too this was intended for a <hi>Figure, Lucus à non lucendo:</hi> For there are <hi>no</hi> men more averse to the profess'd <hi>Drolls; none</hi> that value their <hi>Wit less,</hi> than <hi>those</hi> that are <hi>most</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for the <hi>Institution</hi> and <hi>Designs</hi> of the Royal Society; nor hath <hi>any sort</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:53427:60"/>
of <hi>Enemies</hi> been more injurious to those generous undertakings of the <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> Philosophers, than the <hi>Buffoons</hi> and <hi>Comical Wits</hi> that have still endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd by their malicious Flouts to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them <hi>contemptible</hi> in <hi>Coffee-Houses</hi> and <hi>Taverns</hi>; and have filled the Land with <hi>ridiculous</hi> Stories of their <hi>Designs</hi> and <hi>Performances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, <hi>These</hi> are the men, that M. <hi>Stubb gratifies</hi> by his Book, which (to give him his own Language) will please <hi>none,</hi> but <hi>shallow-brain'd</hi> and <hi>Comical Wits.</hi> [p. 115.] How <hi>shallow-brain'd,</hi> I think those of the <hi>common Drolling</hi> sort, and how <hi>prejudicial</hi> to <hi>Religion, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> I have sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared in a short Discourse at the end of my <hi>CONSIDERATIONS</hi> about <hi>WITCH-CRAFT,</hi> called <hi>A WHIP FOR THE DROLL, FIDLER TO THE ATHEIST.</hi> If M. <hi>Stubb</hi> think fit to look into <hi>that</hi> Appendix, he will see reason <hi>there</hi> to take me out of the Number of the <hi>Comical</hi> People; And if I some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times make a little merry with him in
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53427:60"/>
               <hi>these</hi> Papers, 'tis because I would try, whether I have any of the <hi>Comical Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi> in me or no; If I <hi>have,</hi> 'tis fit that he who first let me know it, should have it first imployed in his Service. And indeed M. <hi>Stubb</hi> is such a <hi>pleasant</hi> Object, as would make a man <hi>Comical,</hi> though his Genius be never so little disposed to that <hi>Iollity</hi> of <hi>Humour.</hi> The sick man that was dying of an <hi>Impostume,</hi> broke into a loud Laughter, when he saw the Ape set the <hi>grave, gold-laced Night-Cap</hi> upon his Head; And 'tis very hard for one to contain, that sees M. <hi>Stubb puts on</hi> a <hi>Pretence</hi> for <hi>Monarchy</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi> If he thinks there is any thing of <hi>Rudeness</hi> in the <hi>Application</hi> of that <hi>ridiculous</hi> Passage, let him thank his Friend M. <hi>Cross</hi> who gave occasion to the Comparison; <hi>That</hi> renowned Author spends a great deal of <hi>serious</hi> pains to prove that I was an <hi>Ape,</hi> or very <hi>like one,</hi> and made <hi>such Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Observations upon the Nature of <hi>that</hi> Animal, that I could not choose, when I lately read it, but <hi>think</hi> of

            <p>But I have done with <hi>this</hi> Design of our Projector also, to <hi>make</hi> the <hi>Comical Wits ridiculous</hi> and <hi>odious:</hi> How far he hath effected it, he will see when Time and Experience have acquainted him, what he hath <hi>made</hi> himself.</p>
            <p>THE last of his great Intendments that I took notice of was, To <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice me</hi> to <hi>publick Obloquy</hi> to settle the <hi>general Repose</hi> and <hi>Tranquillity.</hi> Pref. p. 3.</p>

How he hath demeaned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in it for the effecting of <hi>these,</hi> and his other mighty purposes, I come to consider next, and it was the <hi>Third</hi> general Head of which I proposed to treat. I cannot now fall upon the <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> Examination of all things in his

Work, but shall only give you those <hi>sudden Observations</hi> I made upon a <hi>cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory</hi> Reading, the more <hi>large</hi> and <hi>punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> Confutation shall follow.</p>
            <p n="3">(III.) THEN as to the <hi>MANAGE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT</hi> of his <hi>DESIGNS,</hi> I take notice,</p>
            <p n="1">I. That the <hi>pretended Reason</hi> of his falling on my Book, is very <hi>idle</hi> and <hi>impertinent.</hi> Forsooth, a <hi>Gentleman</hi> at a <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Honour's Table avowed,</hi> that <hi>all the Antient Methods of Science were vain and useless to a Physician,</hi> and <hi>did not as much as contribute to the Cure of a cut Finger,</hi> [Pref. p. 1.] <hi>This</hi> the Gentleman avowed to be the <hi>positive</hi> and <hi>dogmatical Averment even to a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable of M.</hi> Glanvill <hi>and other Virtuosi,</hi> p. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Stubb</hi>'s <hi>Beginning</hi> brings to my mind what I heard last Year at <hi>Oxford;</hi> Being there with a learned and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Knight at the House of a Doctor of Divinity of great note, upon the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of some Discourse concerning our
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53427:62"/>
Author, The Doctor, who knew him very well, spoke to me to <hi>this</hi> purpose, M. <hi>Stubb,</hi> said he, <hi>is so great a — That if he tell you he was at such a Gentleman's Table where this or that Discourse hapned; you are not to believe as much as that he knows that Gentleman, or ever saw him.</hi> I should not have mention'd <hi>this</hi> Passage, but that it fell so pat in my way; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have the more reason to believe the <hi>Doctor</hi> concerning M. <hi>Stubb,</hi> or M. <hi>Stubb</hi> concerning the <hi>Gentlemans Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi> at the Person of Honours Table, I shall not here dispute: But for Peace sake I shall be so <hi>courteous</hi> at present, as to suppose that there was such a Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, and <hi>that</hi> M. <hi>Stubb</hi> ought to take as an instance of <hi>Candour,</hi> and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry large <hi>Charity.</hi> Be it so then for once, There was an <hi>Admirer</hi> of the <hi>Institution</hi> of the Royal Society that talked <hi>so</hi> in the <hi>Anti-Virtuoso</hi>'s Company: but he paid him for his Insolence, and shewed as he tells us, <hi>That the Antient Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy had not been so sterile in reference to Physick, but that it had been the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53427:63"/>
of the Healing</hi> of <hi>cut Fingers,</hi> and <hi>green Wounds.</hi> [Pref. p. 2.] And thus he <hi>sacrificed</hi> that <hi>Virtuoso</hi> to the <hi>Obloquy</hi> of the Table: But yet his Wrath was not appeas'd so, he goes on;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I still retained a Sense of the Injury I supposed done to me, and all rational Physicians by this barbarous Opiniatour; I determined to avenge my Faculty on M.</hi> Glanvill <hi>for this,</hi> [p. 3.] and so I am to be made a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> as well as the <hi>Chymaerical</hi> Gentleman. <hi>Here</hi> was the <hi>Provocation</hi> I gave M. <hi>Stubb,</hi> and <hi>this</hi> Book his <hi>Revenge.</hi>

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53427:63"/>
cure <hi>cut Fingers</hi>; Yea, <hi>Aristotle</hi> was descended of the <hi>Line</hi> of <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> and 'tis not to be question'd, but he could prescribe a <hi>Plaister</hi> for <hi>such</hi> an occasion. <hi>And how little the Antients stood in need of Modern Discoveries and Aids to cure cut Fingers, any man may judge that knows, what</hi> Scribonius <hi>and</hi> Galen <hi>have written, and how this last Author compounds several Medicaments to that purpose,</hi> [ibid.] Those <hi>Galenical Medicaments</hi> for <hi>cut Fingers</hi> he there also names. And he assures us farther [p. 159.] <hi>That he that shall proceed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Notions of Elements,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in Compliance with the Antients, shall not stand in need of any novel Method from the Virtuosi to salve a cut Finger.</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth!</p>
            <p>This, Sir, is one of the <hi>first</hi> Blows he gives the <hi>Victim,</hi> which must needs fall under such fatal Strokes. But what a serious impertinent is this?</p>

               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:53427:64"/>He puts me in mind of a certain <hi>Preacher,</hi> that I once saw, who, at a Funeral, very largely undertook to prove, That <hi>All men must die, This</hi> he did in M. <hi>Stubb's Method,</hi> by <hi>Instances</hi> and <hi>Authorities: Adam</hi> died and <hi>Eve</hi> too, as did <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Rebekah, Iacob</hi> and <hi>Rachel,</hi> the <hi>good men</hi> and the <hi>good Women; so</hi> it befel <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron, David</hi> and <hi>Solomon, Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>; and <hi>so</hi> he went on to reckon up <hi>who had died,</hi> till his Glass hasten'd him to his <hi>Authorities</hi>; where he shewed his <hi>Learning,</hi> and proved his Proposition by the <hi>Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> of <hi>Poets, Philosophers,</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi>; and by that time he had done with <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> and <hi>Ovid, Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> St. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> and St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> 'twas time to make an end.

If

one should affirm, <hi>that the moon is a green Cheese,</hi> or <hi>that M. Stubb is sound in his Head</hi>; would a wise man argue seriously against such an <hi>absurd</hi> Asserter.</p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed these words are mine, <hi>The Vnfruitfulness of those Methods of Science, which in so many Centuries ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver brought the World so much practical beneficial Knowledge, as would help to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Cure of a cut Finger, is a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Argument that they were funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Mistakes, and that the Way was not right,</hi> [Plus Ultra, p. 7, 8.] But what?

the Schools to point at any considerable Discovery made by the direct sole Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Peripatetick Principles.</hi> So that I never dreamt of denying, That those <hi>Philosophers</hi> of <hi>elder</hi> times, that went <hi>that</hi> way, had <hi>practical beneficial Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>; Yea, or that they were <hi>Discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> of many <hi>excellent</hi> and <hi>useful</hi> things; But that they learnt <hi>that</hi> Knowledge from the <hi>disputing Methods</hi> of <hi>Physiology,</hi> or made their <hi>Discoveries by them; These</hi> were the things I <hi>denied</hi>; and I have the excellent Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> with me in my <hi>Negative,</hi> as I may have another occasion to shew. I grant therefore to M. <hi>Stubb</hi> (since he is so zealous to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure this Honour to them) That <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaon</hi> and <hi>Podalirius</hi> in <hi>Homer could cure cut Fingers,</hi> and that <hi>Galen</hi> might make <hi>Diapalma</hi> and other <hi>Medicaments</hi> for <hi>that</hi> purpose; but unless he can prove they did it by the direct Help and Conduct of the <hi>Notional</hi> disputing Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siology, he will not <hi>sacrifice</hi> me to <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Obloquy here,</hi> nor say any thing in which I am at all concern'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:53427:65"/>You see, Sir, we are like to have great matters from an Undertaker that begins with a <hi>ridiculous</hi> Cavil; and the <hi>general Repose</hi> and <hi>Tranquillity,</hi> you may think, will be well <hi>establish'd</hi> by one, that <hi>maliciously</hi> perverts an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Sentence, to make it an occasion of a Quarrel.</p>

I seldom name them, but <hi>shall</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in my <hi>Answer</hi> in <hi>those particulars,</hi> where M. <hi>Stubb</hi> attaques me; and I hope, give you to see, that I affirm no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from mine own head in reciting matters of <hi>Fact,</hi> in which <hi>Fiction</hi> would be <hi>impudent</hi> and <hi>ridiculous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have told you the <hi>Design</hi> of my Book, and the chief things treated of in it. And now one would think, that nothing <hi>less</hi> should be worthy the Courage of such a valiant Wight as M. <hi>Stubb,</hi> than the <hi>main Subject.</hi> You will expect, no doubt, he should attempt to prove, that the <hi>Antients</hi> had <hi>greater Advantages</hi> for <hi>Knowledge,</hi> than <hi>latter</hi> times; that the things I mention as <hi>Modern</hi> Improvements were known to <hi>remote Antiquity</hi>; or that they are <hi>not Helps</hi> for the <hi>Increase</hi> of <hi>Knowledge.</hi> This should have been the Work of one that promiseth such <hi>mighty</hi> things; that was resolved to <hi>readvance</hi> the <hi>Aristote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> and to make the <hi>Virtuosi odious.</hi> But he hath not thought fit to attaque the <hi>Comical Wits this</hi> way; He designed
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53427:67"/>
to make them <hi>ridiculous,</hi> and for <hi>that</hi> he thought something <hi>less</hi> would serve, than <hi>confuting</hi> them.</p>
            <p>He falls upon the <hi>Errata</hi> of the <hi>Press,</hi> and then crows over the Author of <hi>Plus Vltra</hi>; He carps at some little things about the <hi>Philosophical Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Chymistry,</hi> and <hi>Anatomy,</hi> and in his Phansie breaks them to pieces, and then forsooth, all the <hi>other</hi> parts of my Book, which he hath not touch'd, like <hi>Glass-Bubbles</hi> fall to <hi>Dust</hi>: He cavils at some <hi>by-passages</hi> that relate not to the main Business, and instantly <hi>Plus Vltra</hi> is reduced to a <hi>Non-Plus:</hi> He <hi>confutes</hi> his own <hi>Imaginations,</hi> and then <hi>wonders</hi> at my <hi>Ignorance:</hi> He takes the Credit of the <hi>Inventions</hi> I mention from the <hi>Authors</hi> to whom I ascribe them, and gives it to others of the <hi>same</hi> Age, or not far from it; and so the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients</hi> are <hi>readvanced,</hi> and the <hi>Virtuosi</hi> undone.</p>
            <p>This is the man of great Deeds, that will set up, and pluck down what, and whom he pleaseth; that will erect the

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53427:68"/>
Algebra, Geography, Astronomy, Opticks,</hi> and <hi>Natural History,</hi> are no more, than what <hi>every Bookseller</hi> knows, and so it is not fit for a man of his <hi>Learning,</hi> to spend his time so <hi>impertinently,</hi> as to say any thing about them. This, Sir, is the most <hi>pleasant Antagonist</hi> that ever any man had: But we shall have an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of saying somewhat more of him anon, therefore I now pass forward with M. <hi>Stubb,</hi> and come to prove concerning his <hi>Animadversions,</hi> That</p>

            <p>But first I crave your leave to mark how my Adversaries are disagreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves, about my Account of <hi>modern Improvements;</hi> Dr. <hi>Meric Casaubon</hi> in his <hi>Reflections</hi> on my Book, [p. 35.] saith, That it is <hi>an exact Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

            <p>For the Censure of the <hi>sober, learned</hi> man, I can with <hi>no Modesty</hi> own it; I <hi>intended</hi> no <hi>exact</hi> Account; nor am I <hi>able</hi> to give such a one, as can <hi>pretend</hi> to be <hi>accurate</hi>; I only collected <hi>such Instances,</hi> as I thought sufficient for my Design to <hi>encourage Philosophical Hope</hi> and <hi>Endeavours.</hi> For M. <hi>Crosses</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them; Either <hi>every Bookseller</hi> knows them to be <hi>true</hi> or <hi>false</hi>; If this <hi>latter,</hi> why had he not got <hi>some Bookseller</hi> to have informed him, that he might have <hi>proved</hi> it, and <hi>confuted</hi> me? But if every Bookseller knew them to be <hi>true,</hi> what becomes of his Friend M. <hi>Stubb</hi>? and how will he answer my <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> of the great <hi>Advantage</hi> the <hi>later</hi> times have from those <hi>Improvements,</hi> above the Helps that were enjoyed by <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>high Antiquity</hi>?

to his <hi>Champion,</hi> and the Interest of his own Assertion, as well as he can, and descend to the <hi>Proof</hi> of what I have affirmed concerning M. <hi>Stubb's</hi> Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</p>
            <p>This, it is true, makes a <hi>formidable</hi> shew of <hi>invincible</hi> Strength, and he marches in the Van of an <hi>Host</hi> of <hi>Authors,</hi> but with them he <hi>fights Chimaera's,</hi> and takes <hi>Castles</hi> in the <hi>Air,</hi> that his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination built.

            <p n="1">(1.)

This divining</hi> man indeed affirms in his <hi>Libel,</hi> That I have <hi>no Books in my Study, but Plays and Romances;</hi> whenas he never <hi>saw</hi> my <hi>Study,</hi> nor any man else of his Acquaintance, that could inform him; and as luck would have it, I have not one (in <hi>English</hi>) of <hi>either</hi> sort; This 'tis like was M. <hi>Stubb's Intelligencer,</hi> for M. <hi>Cross</hi> writes of me with as <hi>much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,</hi> as if he had been at my <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> and <hi>stood</hi> by me <hi>ever since</hi>; and with as <hi>much Truth,</hi> as if he had <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver seen</hi> me or <hi>known more</hi> concerning me, than he <hi>doth</hi> of the <hi>Man</hi> in the <hi>Moon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well! but if it be <hi>so,</hi> That I never saw the <hi>Authors</hi> I mention, what is
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53427:70"/>
that to M. <hi>Stubb</hi>'s purpose? I was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an <hi>Historical Account</hi> of the <hi>Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> of several sorts of Knowledge; And might I not from other good and approved Writers name the <hi>Inventers</hi> or <hi>Advancers</hi> of <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> Discovery, except I had seen it in the <hi>original</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor? Is there no Credit to be given to the Testimony of learned men? May not one write an <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Things</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> that he never <hi>saw</hi>? and have not most of the <hi>Historians</hi> that ever <hi>were,</hi> done <hi>thus</hi>? May not I say that <hi>Columbus</hi> discover'd the new <hi>western</hi> World; or that <hi>Fust</hi> or <hi>Gothenberg</hi> found out the Mystery of <hi>Printing,</hi> or <hi>Flavius Goia</hi> the <hi>Compass,</hi> except they had told me so themselves? And if it be usual among the most unexceptionable Relaters to collect their Accounts from <hi>other</hi> Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiers, what can M. <hi>Stubb</hi> make of it, if he could prove that I never <hi>saw most</hi> of the <hi>Authors</hi> I mention? How much he himself is acquainted with the <hi>Books</hi> he <hi>quotes,</hi> we shall anon find some things whereby to pass a Judgment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:53427:70"/>Thus M. <hi>Stubb</hi> begins with a <hi>perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory Assertion</hi> of a thing which is <hi>false</hi> in the Latitude of his Affirmation; and which he could not <hi>possibly know,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in any more restrain'd sense it were <hi>true</hi> or <hi>not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And his immediate next words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain another most <hi>gross</hi> and <hi>confident Falshood,</hi> [<hi>And all his Discourse about the Mathematicks and Mathematicians pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured him no other Acknowledgments from a Learned and Reverend Prelate (to whom he sent one of his Books) than a Reprimand for intermedling with what he understood not.</hi> ibid.] I have heard from credible Persons, that M. <hi>Ieanes</hi> the Polemick Writer (who was well acquainted with M. <hi>Cross</hi>) was wont to call any lusty — by a <hi>name,</hi> which for the sake of some worthy Persons, I shall not mention on this occasion. M. <hi>Stubb</hi>'s Friend of <hi>Chuè</hi> knows what I mean. He may do well to advise him to take care of such <hi>broad, unconscionable Falshoods;</hi> though I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess a man of his Practices is the most improper Person in the World for such
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53427:71"/>
a Service. The <hi>Period</hi> I last quoted from M. <hi>Stubb</hi> is a <hi>gross Vntruth;</hi> I sent my <hi>Plus Vltra</hi> but to one Bishop, besides that <hi>Reverend Father</hi> to whom it was <hi>dedicated;</hi> and <hi>that</hi> learned and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Person was so far from sending me a <hi>Reprimand,</hi> (to use M. <hi>Stubb</hi>'s word) that he was pleased to write me a most <hi>obliging Letter of Thanks</hi>; And my own <hi>venerable Diocesan</hi> accepted of <hi>that</hi> Book, and the <hi>Direction</hi> of it to him, with a great deal of <hi>Candour</hi> and <hi>Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and never signified the least Dislike to me of it. So that I should have won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred much at <hi>this</hi> Clause, and divers others of like kind, If I had not heard a <hi>Character</hi> of M. <hi>Stubb</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and did not <hi>know</hi> Him, and his <hi>Familiarity</hi> with M. <hi>Cross</hi>; but now I shall not be surprised though every Sentence were a <hi>Legend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But (2.) he offers something for proof of his first Saying, <hi>viz.</hi> that I never saw the Authors I mention, as it follows, [ib. p. 2.] <hi>who ever heard of such men as Maximus Palanudes, Achazen, and Oren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>?
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53427:71"/>
And who ever heard of <hi>such</hi> things as <hi>Errata</hi> of the Press? If I had a mind to play at this <hi>little Sport,</hi> and would retort, I might ask him, who ever heard of such People as the <hi>Abbigenses</hi> spoken of in his Vind. of Sir <hi>H.

Doth he not know there were such Persons as <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Planudes, Alhazen,</hi> and <hi>Orontius</hi>? and there is not one of <hi>these</hi> that differs <hi>more,</hi> then a <hi>Letter</hi> from the <hi>Names,</hi> over which he so much insults. The <hi>latter</hi> he charitably supposeth to be a <hi>Mistake,</hi> because he thought he could make the man <hi>ridiculous,</hi> and disable him from signifying to my purpose; but of that by and by: If he could have found that the other two had been piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fellows also (as he pretends <hi>this</hi> was) then <hi>Palanudes</hi> should have been corrected by <hi>Planudes,</hi> and <hi>Achazen</hi> by <hi>Alhazen.</hi> And 'tis very strange that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53427:72"/>
M. <hi>Stubb</hi> could not see that <hi>Achazen</hi> was a <hi>Mistake</hi> of the <hi>Press,</hi> when as <hi>Alhazen</hi> stands within <hi>five</hi> Lines of him in my Book; whar a blind thing is Malice, when it hath no mind to see? Well, There were such men as <hi>Planu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, Orontius,</hi> and <hi>Alhazen</hi>; and <hi>Vossius</hi> saith enough of the least considerable of them to justifie my <hi>transient</hi> mention of their Names. Anno 870. <hi>eluxit Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Planudes, qui Diaphanti Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticen Commentariis illustravit.</hi> Voss. de Scient. Mathem. p. 311.

But M. <hi>Stubb</hi> saith of him in Scorn, He was <hi>so famous a Geometrician, that when Sir</hi> H. Savil (<hi>as I remember</hi>) <hi>was to seek of an Instance of a pitiful Fellow, this was the man he fixed on.</hi> [ib. p. 2.] Would not any one from these Words, and their Relation to those that go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, conclude that I had reckoned <hi>Orontius</hi> among the <hi>Improvers</hi> of <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry</hi>? To what purpose else doth the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53427:72"/>
               <hi>Animadverter</hi> speak of him as a <hi>contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible Geometrician</hi>? But if he will look again into my Book, he will see, that I mention not <hi>Orontius</hi> under that head, but name him (and <hi>only so</hi>) among the <hi>Authors</hi> in <hi>Arithmetick:</hi> And have not I as much reason to say, That M. <hi>Stubb never reads the Books he writes against</hi>; as He to affirm, that I <hi>never saw the Authors I mention</hi>? But M. <hi>Stubb</hi> could not <hi>give</hi> his <hi>Studies</hi> so much <hi>Diversion</hi> as to consider what he said. Well, I name <hi>Orontius</hi> among the <hi>Arithmetical</hi> Writers, and 'tis an evident Argument I <hi>never saw him,</hi> because he is a <hi>pitiful Fellow</hi> at <hi>Geometry</hi>; Is <hi>this</hi> Logick <hi>old</hi> or <hi>new</hi>? 'Tis a <hi>sort</hi> M. <hi>Stubb</hi> useth often, but I believe he can shew us nothing more <hi>pitiful</hi> in <hi>Orontius.</hi> But if <hi>Vossius</hi> may be believ'd, <hi>Orontius</hi> did not need so much of M. <hi>Stubb</hi>'s Pity, even in <hi>Geometry.</hi> He tells us, <hi>Anno</hi> 1525. <hi>ac</hi> 30 <hi>proximis claruit Orontius Fineus qui de Geometriâ scripsit Libros duos, item Demonstrationes in sex Libros priores Euclidis.

Yea, if it <hi>had,</hi> I was upon <hi>sure</hi> ground, for I say <hi>no more</hi> then what M. <hi>Stubb</hi> and all men will grant, viz. <hi>That Telescopes were applied to the Heavens by</hi> Galilaeo; I did not say <hi>first,</hi> and so his Pretence from <hi>Borel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> is <hi>impertinent,</hi> and opposeth only the <hi>Shadow</hi> of his own <hi>Imagination: Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilaeo</hi>'s Application of <hi>Telescopes</hi> to the Heavens was <hi>first</hi> famously taken notice of, and those <hi>Tubes</hi> upon that account have been call'd <hi>his Glasses</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I might well enough express my self in such a passage as that, saying,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53427:75"/>
That <hi>those Glasses were bettered since their Application to the Heavens by</hi> Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeo, though M. <hi>Stubb</hi>'s Author must be believed before <hi>Des-Cartes, Vossius,</hi> and most others that have written about this matter; If any one besides the <hi>Animadverter</hi> be of <hi>that</hi> mind, I shall not trouble his Opinion; For M. <hi>Stubb,</hi> I must see a <hi>reason</hi> ere I can believe him before any man, but M. <hi>Cross</hi>; and for <hi>Borellus,</hi> when I know what he saith, I may perhaps tell <hi>this Antagonist</hi> what I think.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, you see something of this mans <hi>notorious Cavilling</hi> and <hi>Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi>; and I might have taken notice further, that he <hi>misquotes</hi> me too in the recited <hi>Period,</hi> For I say not that the <hi>Telescope was invented by</hi> Galilaeo: But M. <hi>Stubb</hi> makes me say what he thinks <hi>fit,</hi> and when he hath confuted his <hi>own Mistake,</hi> he phansieth he hath <hi>reduced</hi> me to a <hi>Non-Plus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Passage</hi> likewise that follows may be <hi>justly censured,</hi> viz. <hi>That my Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on takes from the Society all Pretensions

            <p n="4">(4.) He next cavils at some passages of mine concerning the Barometer, I introduce my Discourse about <hi>that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical Instrument</hi> thus, [<hi>That there is Gravity even in the Air it self; and that that Element is only comparatively
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53427:76"/>
light, is now made evident and palpable by experience, though</hi> Aristotle <hi>and his Schools held a different Theory: And by the help of Quicksilver in a Tube</hi> —] In opposition to this he saith, <hi>That there is Gravity even in the Air it self; and that that Element is only comparatively light, was of old made evident by the man of</hi> Stagyra. [p. 7.] But how did <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> make that <hi>evident</hi>? It was by the Experiment of a <hi>blown Bladder</hi>; as [p. 4.] Let us remember <hi>this,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve how he goes on: <hi>M.</hi> Glanvill <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther understands what he opposeth, nor what he asserts;</hi> But <hi>why so</hi> I pray? enter the <hi>Reason: For in the Beginning he speaks of the Gravitation of the Element of Air, whereas the Instrument called the Barometer proposeth only a Way to measure the Degrees of Compression in the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphere, in which Region I believe no man ever denied, but that the aqueous and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial Corpuscles interspers'd had their Weight and Pressure,</hi> [p. 7.] Now I look back, and return the Complement; M. <hi>Stubb neither understands what he
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53427:76"/>
opposeth, nor what he asserts,</hi> This I prove by his own Argument; For he saith Aristotle <hi>proved the Gravitation of the Element of Air, and that by the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a blown Bladder,</hi> in which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>no man ever denied, but that the aqueous and terrestrial particles intersperst had their Weight and Pressure.</hi> In short, I propose this <hi>Dilemma</hi> to M. <hi>Stubb</hi> to be consider'd; when he affirms, in my words, concerning <hi>Aristotle,</hi> That he proved the <hi>Element</hi> of <hi>Air to be only comparatively light,</hi> He meant either the <hi>supposed, pure,</hi> or the <hi>mixed Air</hi>; If the <hi>former,</hi> let him shew how the man of <hi>Stagyra</hi> proved <hi>that</hi> to <hi>ponderate</hi> by the <hi>Bladder</hi>; If the <hi>latter,</hi> why might not I mean the <hi>same</hi>? There is no reason but <hi>this,</hi> M. <hi>Stubb</hi> would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted as he <hi>means</hi>; and I shall be <hi>understood,</hi> as is <hi>fit</hi> for his <hi>Design.</hi> Yea, The <hi>Caviller</hi> might easily have known, (and no doubt he did so) that by <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Air</hi> I meant <hi>that</hi> of the <hi>Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphere,</hi> since he cannot suppose, that one of <hi>his Virtuosi</hi> should hold a <hi>pure peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetical
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53427:77"/>
Element</hi> of <hi>Air,</hi> except he will call the <hi>Aether</hi> by <hi>that</hi> Name: So that here the <hi>Animadverter wilfully</hi> mistakes me, to make an occasion to vent his impotent spight. 'Tis M. <hi>Hooks</hi> Opinion of the Air, That it is <hi>a kind of Tincture and Solution of terrestrial and aqueous Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles dissolv'd in the Aether,</hi> and <hi>agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by it</hi>; Micr. p. 13. I am of the <hi>same</hi> mind, and never dream'd of such a thing in what I said, as an <hi>unmixed, peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetical Element.</hi> And thus his Malice here also is <hi>nonsensical</hi> and <hi>impertinent,</hi> For he saith, I begun with the <hi>Gravity</hi> of the <hi>Element of Air,</hi> whereas the <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter is an Instrument to weigh the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Compression in the Atmosphere</hi>; and hence he would have it clear, that I <hi>know neither what I oppose, or what I assert:</hi> And it is evident on the other hand, that the <hi>Caviller</hi> either <hi>knows not</hi> what he <hi>saith,</hi> or <hi>saith</hi> what he <hi>knows</hi> to be <hi>idle</hi> and <hi>inconsequent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, in the words that follow a little after he represents <hi>Aristotle</hi> alike <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent</hi> as himself, for he proves the <hi>Air

And yet <hi>p.</hi> 5. in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin he tells us, that <hi>many Peripateticks</hi> (naming only one, <hi>Claramontius</hi>) <hi>held that the impure Air of our Atmosphere doth gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitate,</hi> it seems others of them did <hi>not</hi> hold <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>impure</hi> Air of the <hi>Atmosphere,</hi> no doubt, for sure he did not catch the <hi>pure Element</hi> in a <hi>Bladder; That Air no man in his wits ever denied to be ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous;</hi> And was not <hi>Aristotle</hi> as well imployed as M. <hi>Stubb,</hi> when he proved, that the <hi>Antients could cure cut fingers</hi>? But what must become of all the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticks that held <hi>not</hi> the <hi>Air</hi> to be <hi>ponderous?

What Feats would this man do against the <hi>Virtuosi,</hi> if he

had any <hi>real</hi> Advantage, when he ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures every where to make himself <hi>ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous</hi> and <hi>absurd,</hi> rather then he will let the least passage go against which he can form the <hi>appearance</hi> of an <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>?</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) I take notice next, that he falls upon me [p. 10.] for the <hi>Epithete</hi> of <hi>Heathen</hi> given to some of <hi>Aristotles Notions:</hi> my words are <hi>these,</hi> [<hi>And the Zeal I have for the Glory of the Almighty discover'd in his Creatures, hath inspired me with some Smartness and Severity against those heathen Notions, which have so unhappily diverted learned men from the Study of Gods great Book,</hi> Universal Nature. —[Pref. to <hi>Plus Vlt.</hi>]</p>
            <p>If I had chanced to have left out <hi>that Epithete,</hi> or to have put <hi>another</hi> in its place (either of which might have been done, and my Discourse, yea <hi>that</hi> very Period had not been concerned) The <hi>Caviller</hi> had lost an opportunity of very <hi>learned Animadversions</hi>; and a <hi>minute verbal Alteration</hi> of about a <hi>dozen</hi> other <hi>Sentences</hi> in my Book, would make all

But I must let <hi>that</hi> pass, the general <hi>Impertinence</hi> is <hi>notorious</hi> every where, and <hi>this</hi> is one of the <hi>least</hi> of M. <hi>Stubb's Imperfections</hi>; I note a <hi>worse Fault</hi> here, His <hi>Stricture</hi> is a Falshood, the words are [<hi>He inveighs bitterly against</hi> Aristotle <hi>for his Heathen Notions,</hi> p. 10.] I reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my Period, from whence the <hi>Caviller</hi> takes this occasion, before, let any man judge whether I <hi>inveigh</hi> against <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> for his <hi>Heathen Notions,</hi> or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the word <hi>Heathen</hi> bears any great stress in <hi>that</hi> Sentence. But M. <hi>Stubb makes</hi> what he <hi>confutes.</hi> He implies p. 11. that this was the <hi>Motive that swayed me to Anti-Aristotelism,</hi> viz. the <hi>Heathenism</hi> of his <hi>Notions,</hi> which is a mere <hi>Invention</hi> of his own Brain, and such a one as he knows to be a <hi>gross Vntruth,</hi> for he pretends to have <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed</hi> my <hi>Letter</hi> concerning <hi>Aristotle,</hi> which contains several of my <hi>Motives,</hi> but makes this <hi>none</hi>; and my <hi>Scepsis

            </p>
            <p>But he hath not done persecuting the poor <hi>Epithete</hi>; [<hi>Alas! He is troubled at his Heathen Notions! Oh! rare Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanism!</hi> and afterwards it follows, <hi>Nothing hath more of the</hi> Presbyterian <hi>and</hi> Fanatick <hi>than this Topick,</hi> ib. p. 11.] Say you so M. <hi>Harry!</hi> Suppose one should call <hi>Vniversities, Churches, Church-Yards, Bells, — Antichristian, Idolatrous, Popish, Superstitious,</hi> as one M. <hi>Stubb</hi> did in his <hi>Light out of Darkness</hi>; would there not be more of the <hi>Fanatick</hi> in <hi>that</hi>? Or should he speak against all <hi>Humane Learning</hi> and <hi>Heathenish Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> as the <hi>same</hi> Author, would there not be as much of <hi>Fanaticism</hi> in such talk? 'Tis <hi>Puritanical</hi> and <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> it seems to inveigh against <hi>Heathen Notions,</hi> but not so to decry <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish Authors</hi> and <hi>Heathen Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> L. D. [p. 101.] But however it is, I am not at all concerned, For I no where <hi>inveigh against Heathen Notions,</hi>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:53427:79"/>
but in M. <hi>Stubb</hi>'s Book, (not I mean because they are <hi>Heathen</hi>) though I speak against those of them, which I judge either <hi>false, uncertain,</hi> or <hi>useless.</hi> So that the Questions that follow about <hi>Atoms, Corpuscles, Mathematical Terms, Languages,</hi> &amp;c. are <hi>impertinent,</hi> and the man only <hi>disputes</hi> with <hi>himself</hi> in his <hi>Dream.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">(6.) In the same Paragraph my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about <hi>Aristotle</hi> is confuted in short, For those Exceptions against him are <hi>nothing but Lies,</hi> [ibid. p. 11.] what ill luck hath M. <hi>Stubb</hi> to have controversie with none but <hi>Liers</hi>? Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> was a <hi>notorious Falsifier;</hi> M. <hi>Baxter</hi> a <hi>great Calumniator</hi> and <hi>Lier;</hi> the Royal Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety have yet invented <hi>nothing</hi> but a <hi>LIE;</hi> [ubi sup.] Dr. <hi>Sprat</hi> is a <hi>Legendary Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian,</hi> and my <hi>Animadversions</hi> on <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> are <hi>all Lies.</hi> It seems as soon as M. <hi>Stubb</hi> makes any man his <hi>Adversary,</hi> he commenceth <hi>Lier, ipso facto;</hi> And this I think, that (as he said to Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi>) <hi>one of us two is grosly ignorant,</hi> he may to <hi>every</hi> other Antagonist, <hi>one
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53427:80"/>
of us two is a gross teller of Lies; this</hi> I have proved in <hi>part</hi> already, and it will appear <hi>further</hi> in some of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Notes. But as to my <hi>Reflections</hi> on <hi>Aristotle,</hi> if they are <hi>Lies,</hi> they are none of <hi>mine,</hi> the matters of Fact are reported from <hi>Patricius, Picus, Gassen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, Lord Bacon, Laertius, Suidas, Aeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Arrian, Plutarch, Eusebius,</hi> and such like Authors; If <hi>these</hi> are all <hi>Liers</hi> too, there are no <hi>Tell-troths</hi> but M. <hi>Stubb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But 'tis a <hi>rare Protestation</hi> that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; <hi>I protest in the Presence of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, that if there be not great Care taken, we may be in a little time reduced to that pass as to believe the Story of</hi> Tom Thumb,— p. 11.] Doth M. <hi>Stubb seriously think this,</hi> or doth he <hi>not</hi>? If <hi>so,</hi> he is more <hi>ridiculous</hi> than one that believes <hi>Tom Thumb</hi> already; If he be <hi>not serious</hi> in what he saith, he is <hi>impious</hi> in it; And if it were an <hi>other</hi> man, one might ask him, how he durst in that manner use the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>protest</hi> a <hi>known</hi> and <hi>ridiculous Falshood</hi> in his <hi>Presence.</hi>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:53427:80"/>
But who can tell what M. <hi>Stubb</hi> thinks of God? He saith enough sometimes to give occasion to conjecture; who knows but that <hi>all Religion</hi> is with a certain <hi>Anti-Virtuoso</hi> like the <hi>Story</hi> of <hi>Tom Thumb</hi>? And he might do well to inform us how far he extends his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the <hi>Legends</hi> and <hi>Falsifications</hi> of History. I shall not here to tell you what I have heard him say.</p>
            <p>But he goes on [<hi>This Philosophy fairly disposeth us thereunto.</hi>] viz. to believe <hi>Tom Thumb</hi> and the <hi>Legends.</hi> If <hi>so,</hi> I hope he will excuse it from the so often objected Guilt of <hi>Scepticism</hi>? But <hi>these</hi> Philosophers one while dispose men to <hi>believe every thing</hi>; and at the next turn to <hi>believe nothing.</hi> And yet one would wonder, how the <hi>Philosophy</hi> of the <hi>Virtuosi</hi> should incline men either to the <hi>one</hi> or the <hi>other.</hi> It deals in the <hi>plain Objects</hi> of <hi>Sense,</hi> in which, if any where, there is <hi>Certainty</hi>; and teacheth <hi>suspen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ion</hi> of <hi>Assent</hi> till what is <hi>proposed,</hi> is well proved; and so is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Adversary to <hi>Scepticism</hi> and <hi>Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:53427:81"/>
But M. <hi>Stubb</hi> tells us, [ibid.] that it makes men so <hi>credulous</hi> by <hi>taking them off from the Pedantism of Philology and antient reading,</hi> — It <hi>takes</hi> men off indeed, as <hi>Philology</hi> takes them off from <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and <hi>one</hi> sort of Studies takes men off from an <hi>other,</hi> which they are not able to pursue at the same time with it: But <hi>this</hi> is no more discredit to the <hi>Modern Philosophy,</hi> then 'tis to all other sorts of Learning, and indeed none to any. If M. <hi>Stubb</hi> means more than <hi>this,</hi> and would insinuate that <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Disquisitions</hi> into Nature, have any direct <hi>Antipathy</hi> to <hi>Philology</hi> or <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Reading,</hi> he speaks what is <hi>false</hi> and <hi>groundless</hi>; and is not able to say any thing to purpose, to make such a Censure good. He tells us indeed he is resolved to <hi>charge the Enemy home,</hi> and he doth it by <hi>confident Falshoods</hi> and <hi>bold Affirmations</hi> without proof: His whole <hi>Force</hi> is in <hi>Noise</hi> and <hi>Clamour</hi>; and did he not keep a great <hi>Stir,</hi> and raise the Dust about him, he would scarce engage any to <hi>look towards</hi>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:53427:81"/>
him, or to take <hi>notice</hi> what he <hi>doth</hi> or <hi>saith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">(7.) He proceeds to animadvert up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me thus, [<hi>He tells us that the Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotelian Philosophy aims at no more than the instructing men in Notion and Dispute, that its Design was mean,</hi> — p. 12.] He quotes not the place whence this is taken, and 'tis well he doth not, for he mis-reports my Words, and affirms that which is <hi>false,</hi> for I was not speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there of the <hi>Aristotelian</hi> Philosophy, but of the <hi>Modern Peripatetick Way,</hi> which I affirm in <hi>that</hi> very <hi>Page</hi> to be now quite another thing from the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy which Aristotles Books contain,</hi> and have frequently spoke to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose elsewhere: Now let any one look into the <hi>voluminous Physicks</hi> of <hi>Ariaga, Hurtado, Pontius, Oviedo, Carlton,</hi> and the rest of the late Peripatetick Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and let him then tell me what they aim at more, than the <hi>instructing men in Notion</hi> and <hi>Dispute.</hi> To talk here as the <hi>Caviller</hi> doth, of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Animals,</hi> and <hi>Theophrastus</hi> about
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53427:82"/>
               <hi>Plants,</hi> and such like things, is <hi>toyish, impertinent,</hi> and <hi>like</hi> M. <hi>Stubb</hi>; And all the rest of the chat that comes in upon this occasion turns to wind and insignificant Prattle. This is the man that would charge the Enemy home; we are like to have good doings in his <hi>Quotations</hi> of <hi>other</hi> Authors, when he perverts even the words of his Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonist.</p>
            <p>He is at the same sport again, [p. 14.] <hi>If Notions might be rejected for being first proposed, and used by</hi> Heathens, <hi>then is not</hi> Aristotle <hi>in a worse Condition</hi> than Epicurus, Democritus, Plato, <hi>or</hi> Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras, — p. 15. He desires me to <hi>acquit</hi> Paracelsus <hi>from being impious in his Life.</hi> At <hi>this</hi> rate, there will be no end of <hi>Animadversions,</hi> and 'twill be impossible to escape the <hi>Anti-Virtuoso</hi>; Who said that <hi>Notions</hi> might be <hi>reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted</hi> for being <hi>first proposed,</hi> and <hi>used by Heathens</hi>? or what hath M. <hi>Glanvill</hi> to do with <hi>Paracelsus</hi>?</p>
            <p>But further [ibid. p. 15. <hi>He saith,</hi> Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle <hi>was of no such superlative Esteem
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53427:82"/>
in the wisest Times; But he tells us not what those most wise Times were, when he was in Disesteem</hi>] What need I? I said not that he was in <hi>Disesteem in the most wise Times</hi>; but of <hi>no such super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Account,</hi> as he himself quotes my words in <hi>one</hi> Line, and makes quite another thing of them in the <hi>next.</hi> For is there no Difference, doth he think, between not being of <hi>superlative Account,</hi> and being in <hi>Disesteem</hi>? Such <hi>gross</hi> Slips as <hi>these</hi> in a <hi>Virtuoso</hi> would have afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed matter for <hi>endless Insultings,</hi> and <hi>Charges</hi> of <hi>Ignorance.</hi> He proceeds to prove that <hi>Aristotle</hi> was in <hi>Esteem</hi> in <hi>wise Times</hi>; and what then? It follows clearly, that M. <hi>Stubb</hi> can <hi>demonstrate,</hi> what <hi>no body denies.</hi> But was he in the <hi>most superlative</hi> account <hi>then</hi>? He doth not say <hi>so,</hi> for <hi>that</hi> had been to <hi>his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:</hi> or were those times when his Esteem was <hi>superlative,</hi> the <hi>wisest</hi>? He shifts from <hi>this</hi> too; he had not read of more <hi>wise People, than</hi> Greece, Rome, <hi>and the</hi> Mahometans, — <hi>and all these admired him at several times</hi>; but was
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53427:83"/>
their Admiration <hi>superlative,</hi> when the times were <hi>wisest</hi>? otherwise what he saith is not to purpose. He confesseth [<hi>ibid.</hi>] that he was much <hi>opposed and slighted by the first Fathers</hi>; and in his <hi>Light out of Darkness,</hi> p. 105. he saith, That <hi>Aristotle was condemned by the first Christians, and Honest men of all Ages.</hi> And I think the times of the <hi>first Fathers</hi> during the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> were some of the <hi>wisest</hi> times; and I mention in my Letter concerning <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi> the Observation of <hi>Gassendus,</hi> that in the <hi>flourishing</hi> times of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Athens,</hi> the <hi>Academicks</hi> and <hi>Stoicks</hi> were more in Esteem, than the <hi>Sectators</hi> of <hi>Aristotle</hi>; and instance in <hi>Cicero, Pliny,</hi> and <hi>Quintilian,</hi> who though they had a great Esteem of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> did yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>Plato</hi> before him. So that in those most <hi>wise</hi> Times, and among those wise men, <hi>Aristotle's Account</hi> was not <hi>superlative,</hi> if <hi>Gassendus,</hi> or M. <hi>Stubb</hi> himself be to be believed.</p>
            <p>And methinks it proves much, that the <hi>wisest</hi> men and times had the most
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53427:83"/>
               <hi>superlative</hi> Account of <hi>Aristotle</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause They <hi>divided into Platonists and Aristotelians, as they did into Catholicks and Arrians,</hi> and the <hi>Arrians were Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotelians,</hi> ibid. <hi>Aristotle</hi> was of <hi>best</hi> Account, because the <hi>Catholicks</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Plato,</hi> and the <hi>Arrians</hi> were <hi>Aristotle's</hi> Followers. Doth not this tend to the <hi>re-advancing</hi> the <hi>Credit</hi> of <hi>Aristotle</hi>? If this will not do it, <hi>Aristotle</hi> shall be <hi>re-advanc'd</hi> by and by; it follows, [p. 15, 16.] <hi>Mahomet's Successors</hi> the <hi>Caliphs</hi> did wholly <hi>imploy themselves to improve the Doctrines of</hi> Aristotle, <hi>and the Peripateticks: So that Aristotelism, Arrianism, and Mahometanism issued out of the same Parts of the World,</hi> viz. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria, and the adjacent Countries.— This</hi> the <hi>Virtuoso</hi> could not see, because <hi>so much History was above his reach,</hi> p. 16. and the <hi>Reasoning</hi> is as much above it as the <hi>History.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He next quotes another passage of mine, relating to the same business, viz. <hi>That since the minds of Christians are enlightned with the Raies of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53427:84"/>
Gospel, they have less reason to</hi> bow down <hi>to the</hi> Dictates <hi>of an</hi> Idolater <hi>and an</hi> Heathen.] Hence M. <hi>Impertinent</hi> concludes, that we must bid <hi>farewel to the Rhetorick, and other Works of Aristotle,</hi> which I had afore <hi>recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>; and he adds that we must <hi>shake hands with Seneca, Epictetus, and Plato,</hi> p. 16. This follows like the rest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we may not <hi>bow down,</hi> and give an <hi>implicit</hi> Veneration to an <hi>Heathen Authority</hi>; Therefore we must bid <hi>farewel</hi> to <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Works</hi> of those Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; As if there were no Difference between <hi>using</hi> their Works, and <hi>servilely adoring</hi> them.</p>
            <p n="8">(8.) He perstringeth a passage cited out of <hi>Plato,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and what I add, viz. That [The Universe must be known by the <hi>Art,</hi> by which it was made.] Here I am sent to answer Dr. <hi>More's Dialogues,</hi> where he <hi>explodes the Mechanism of Nature.</hi> ibid. p. 16.]</p>
            <p>Before I descend to the particular Answer to <hi>this,</hi> I take notice, that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53427:84"/>
M. <hi>Stubb</hi> runs up and down, and flirts from some things to others, which have no <hi>Coherence</hi> among themselves, or in my Book. He falls upon my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course about <hi>Philosophical Instruments</hi>; and <hi>then,</hi> without any occasion given, suddenly steps back against a passage in my Preface, that hath no relation in the world to his Discourse, as p. 10. In the same Paragraph he leaps forward again to the 124. page of my <hi>Plus Vltra,</hi> and largely confu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Thank you for yours, which I received by the hand of your Friend and Neighbour <hi>M. C.</hi> Before I received your Letter I had not read half a Page in your Antagonists Book, for I had only seen it once by chance in one of our Fellows Chambers, but had no leisure as yet to read it, my time being taken up with other matters; And therefore I was wholly ignorant of those passages, <hi>p.</hi> 173. till your Letter gave me an occasion to enquire after the Book, and to read all there that concerns my self: At which I must confess I was much <hi>surprised</hi>; especially at that particular passage, which was pointed me to by another Letter from a Friend, the day after yours; <hi>that passage</hi> I mean, wherein he makes as <hi>if I were not still a Member of the Royal Society,</hi> but <hi>had left it</hi>; grounding his Assertion upon this Reason, [<hi>For he allows nothing to it now</hi>] It was a great marvel to me, that he should pretend to know better than my self, whether I be still of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53427:86"/>
the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> or no. For <hi>I take my self still to be of it, and I am sure I have not left it.</hi> And as for the Reason he would build his Conclusion upon, in that sense as it will seem to sound to all men at the first reading, namely, <hi>That I allow them no Respect, nor have any Esteem for them now,</hi> it is <hi>grosly false.</hi> For the great Opinion I have of their <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Philosophy,</hi> I have at least two moneths ago amply testified in my Preface to my <hi>Enchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridion Metaphysicum,</hi> when I did not at all dream of any such passage of your Antagonist concerning me in his Book. And do particularly note how serviceable their <hi>Natural Experiments</hi> in <hi>matter</hi> are to the clear Knowledge and Demonstration of the <hi>Existence</hi> of <hi>immaterial Beings:</hi> So far are they from tending to <hi>Atheism.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And 'tis <hi>invidiously</hi> done of your Adversary to commend me for <hi>Piety,</hi> with an <hi>unworthy</hi> and <hi>odious</hi> Reflection on the <hi>Society,</hi> as if men were <hi>less pious</hi> for being thereof: whenas I dare say there are as <hi>pious</hi> Persons of that <hi>Society,</hi> as there are out of it; and it is a gross mistake in him, that he looks upon <hi>that Mechanick Philosophy</hi> which I op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, to be the <hi>Philosophy</hi> the <hi>Royal Society</hi> doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, or would support. But the Philosophy which they aim at, is a more <hi>perfect Philosophy,</hi> as yet to be raised out of faithful and skilful <hi>Experiments</hi> in Nature, which is so far from tending to <hi>Atheism,</hi> that I am confident, it will utterly rout it and the <hi>Mechanical Philosophy</hi> at once, in that sense which I oppose, namely, as it signifies a Philosophy that professeth, <hi>That Matter having such a Quantity of Motion as it has, would contrive it self into all those Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nomena we see in Nature.</hi> But this Profession cannot rightly be called the <hi>Mechanical Philosophy,</hi> but the <hi>Mechanical Belief</hi> of <hi>Credulity.</hi> For it has
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53427:87"/>
no ground of Reason in the earth to support it. But there are <hi>many</hi> and <hi>most palpable Demonstrations</hi> against it, as all the World shall see in my <hi>Enchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridion Metaphysicum.</hi> Wherefore it is a very <hi>high Injury</hi> of your Antagonist, to father so <hi>absurd</hi> a Profession upon a <hi>Society</hi> of such Learning and Judgment as the <hi>Royal Society</hi> is.</p>
                  <p>I believe indeed most of us, I am sure my self does conceive, that <hi>Generation, Corruption, Alteration,</hi> and all the <hi>Vicissitudes</hi> of <hi>corporeal</hi> Nature are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but <hi>Unions</hi> and <hi>Dissolutions</hi> (I will add also the <hi>Formations</hi> and <hi>Deformations</hi>) of little <hi>Bodies</hi> or <hi>Particles</hi> of <hi>differing Figures, Magnitudes,</hi> and <hi>Velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities.</hi> But <hi>this</hi> thus bounded is not the <hi>Mechanical Philosophy,</hi> but part of the old <hi>Pythagorick</hi> or <hi>Mosaick Philosophy,</hi> so far as I can see by any <hi>History.</hi> So that 'tis very unskilfully done of your Antagonist to bring me in as opposing, or clashing with the <hi>Royal Society</hi> in a thing of this great Consequence, and so to make <hi>them</hi> Patrons of <hi>that,</hi> which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any <hi>sound Philosophy,</hi> nor <hi>true Religion</hi> can allow.</p>
                  <p>Nor can I have so low a conceit of your Parts, Judgment, and Virtue, as to think, when you magnifie <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s-Cartes his Philosophy</hi> so highly as you do, that it is for that <hi>hasty Presumption</hi> of <hi>his,</hi> that upon the <hi>Supposal</hi> that <hi>Matter</hi> was possest of so much <hi>Motion</hi> as there is in the World, it would <hi>necessarily</hi> at length contrive it self into all <hi>such Phaenomena,</hi> as we see in the Universe; but because several of his Conceptions concerning the <hi>Figures</hi> of the <hi>Particles</hi> of such and such Bodies are exceeding plansible, and probable: amongst which <hi>that</hi> of the <hi>Globuli</hi> seems to me so far to surpass all other <hi>Hypotheses</hi> about <hi>Light,</hi> that I stand to him close against his most able Opposers in <hi>that point</hi> in my <hi>Enchiridion Metaphysicum,</hi> so far forth as concerns the <hi>Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical</hi>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:53427:87"/>
part of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Colours.</hi> But mere <hi>Mechanism</hi> does not exhaust all in those <hi>Phaenomena</hi> neither, as I there prove in a long Chapter on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. By this time I think it is plain, what <hi>Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Philosophy</hi> that is, that may incline men to <hi>Atheism,</hi> and that it is not the <hi>experimental Philosophy,</hi> which the <hi>Royal Society</hi> professes, that is, <hi>that</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy which inclines men to <hi>Atheism,</hi> but quite contrary, as I shall manifestly demonstrate in my <hi>Exhiridion Metaphysicum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I think there is nothing now that concerns me in the Page you point me to in your Letter, but my Judgment touching that large passage of the Learned and Eloquent Dr. <hi>Sprat,</hi> and the Deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons therein contained, which <hi>Deductions,</hi> says your Antagonist, <hi>I would not approve of as Necessary, but Ridiculous</hi>; Truly if I had said <hi>so,</hi> I should have made my self <hi>ridiculous</hi>; For how could I approve of <hi>Deductions,</hi> especially in so <hi>serious</hi> a point, as, or <hi>Quatenus Ridiculous</hi>; For there is no man, let him be never so <hi>pious,</hi> unless he be a <hi>Fool,</hi> that can approve of <hi>Deductions</hi> for their being <hi>ridiculous</hi> in so serious a Cause. But it seems he having a mind to <hi>monopolize</hi> all the <hi>Wit</hi> in the World to himself, is content to repute me for <hi>Pious,</hi> so he may remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate me withal to the World to be a <hi>Fool,</hi> and <hi>such</hi> as he may play the <hi>Fool</hi> withal, as he has in all this Page you have pointed me to. I might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed approve of those Deductions as <hi>smooth</hi> and <hi>plausible,</hi> though not as <hi>necessary,</hi> but something of a <hi>lubricous</hi> and <hi>doubtful</hi> Aspect; but I know very well I could not approve of them as <hi>ridiculous.</hi> But I add further, that there are such <hi>Experiments</hi> made by us of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> that do not only plausibly invite us to, but afford us most <hi>forcible</hi> and <hi>evident Demonstrations</hi> for the Belief of the <hi>Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence</hi>

            <p>This Letter I publish, because my Reverend and Learned Friend hath given me leave to print it, and he writes that he is much offended, that M. <hi>Stubb</hi> should pick him up as a <hi>sensless Clod</hi> in the High-way, to pelt so honourable a Society with, of which he is a Member.</p>
            <p>You may judge by <hi>this,</hi> Sir, how far we are to believe M. <hi>Stubb,</hi> when he tells us how many have <hi>deserted</hi> the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Society, when the very <hi>first</hi> Person that he names, disproves the <hi>impudent</hi> Falshood. What a man is <hi>this</hi> that dares <hi>bely</hi> so <hi>Reverend</hi> a Person in the face of the World? and what am I to

expect from him; if one, of whom he pretends to speak well, be thus used? By this you may see what <hi>Mechanism</hi> of Nature it is, that Dr. <hi>More explodes,</hi> and how <hi>impertinently</hi> and <hi>maliciously</hi> the <hi>Animadverter</hi> urgeth this learned man against the <hi>Mechanick Philosophy</hi> of the Royal Society, and <hi>that</hi> which I have recommended. And there is no doubt but were the <hi>other Authors,</hi> which he quotes, alive, and able to do themselves right, they would most of them <hi>disclaim</hi> the <hi>senses,</hi> which this <hi>Perverter</hi> of their meaning puts upon them, to serve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in his <hi>Cavilling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">(10.) But I am charged with this very fault, [p. 19.] and M. <hi>Stubb</hi> will have it, that I have <hi>mis-reported</hi> the first Discourse between M. <hi>Cross</hi> and my self; He <hi>prefaceth</hi> to what he saith in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the <hi>Disputer</hi> thus, <hi>Nor will I engage particularly in the Dispute between him and M.</hi> Cross; and as soon as he had told us he would <hi>not</hi> do it, he <hi>begins</hi> in the <hi>immediate next</hi> words, and proceeds to <hi>do it,</hi> in several of the following Pages.</p>

But to shew how <hi>unsupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able such kind of men,</hi> as the <hi>Virtuosi, are in all judicious and intelligent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi> he sets down my Discourse with M. <hi>Cross</hi> about <hi>Dioptrick Tubes.</hi> [ibid. p. 2.4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] And the <hi>first Remark</hi> he makes upon it [p. 27.] is, That I <hi>have little or no insight into Opticks;</hi> This he <hi>remarks roundly,</hi> but doth not shew us how he <hi>inferrs</hi> it from my Discourse, but <hi>adds</hi> immediately, <hi>The Solution of M.</hi> Crosses <hi>Fallacy, if it were his, by that Interrogatory,</hi> why cannot he write better with two Pens than with a single one? <hi>is ridiculous, since there is no Uis

unita there.</hi>— But who told M. <hi>Stubb</hi> that my instance of the <hi>two Pens,</hi> was a <hi>Solution</hi> of M. <hi>Crosses Fallacy</hi> about the <hi>two Spectacles</hi>? Let him but look back upon the words that he had newly recited, and he will see, that I alledge <hi>this</hi> to shew the <hi>Ridiculousness</hi> of M. <hi>Crosses</hi> Argument; I do not say there is a <hi>Vis unita</hi> in the <hi>two Pens;</hi> But <hi>this</hi> I do, that there is as <hi>much</hi> of it <hi>there,</hi> as in the <hi>two Spectacles,</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we may as well <hi>inferr, That a man can write with two Pens better than with one singly,</hi> because <hi>Uis unita fortior</hi>; as, <hi>that one can see better with two pair of Spectacles, than with one,</hi> for <hi>that</hi> reason; which was M. <hi>Crosses</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that is, there is no <hi>Consequence</hi> in <hi>either.</hi> So that I <hi>first</hi> shew the <hi>Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity</hi> of my Antagonists <hi>Reasoning</hi> by the instance of the <hi>Pens,</hi> and <hi>then</hi> solve his <hi>Fallacy</hi> by <hi>denying</hi> there is any <hi>Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> unita</hi> in the two pair of <hi>Spectacles,</hi> as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows immediately in the words that M. <hi>Stubb</hi> cites from my Book, <hi>The Reason he</hi> [M. <hi>C.</hi>] <hi>gave, why one would
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53427:92"/>
expect it should be so,</hi> viz. that a man should see better with two pair, than one, <hi>is the Reason why 'tis not,</hi> namely, because there is no <hi>Vis unita</hi> in the <hi>two,</hi> as I had intimated before, and <hi>do again</hi> in the words immediately following. So that M. <hi>Stubb</hi> here either wanted <hi>Spectacles,</hi> or saw what I said through the <hi>double ones</hi> of his <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,</hi> that mis-represented my Discourse to him.</p>
            <p>But that which follows in the same Period is yet more <hi>marvellous,</hi> my <hi>Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Fallacy</hi> by the <hi>two Pens</hi> he had said is <hi>ridiculous,</hi> since there is no <hi>Vis unita there,</hi> to which he adds in the immediate next words, <hi>And in one sort of Tubes, though the Rays be united in the first convex Glass, and brought to a Convergency, yet must the sphaerical Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the next dilate it again, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them fittingly to effect the expected vision in the Retina.</hi> How doth this prove that my solution of M. <hi>Crosses</hi> Fallacy by the two Pens is <hi>ridiculous</hi>? What distant things ramble together
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53427:93"/>
into this mans wild Phansie? But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he had reference to something I had said before; I will charitably sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>this,</hi> to try if I can make any sense of his arguing; I had said that <hi>we see better through the two Glasses in Perspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives, than any single one, because they are so fashion'd and order'd that the visive Rays are better gather'd and united by them for the Advantage of Sight:</hi> If this be not the thing he mutters against, I cannot imagine what he means; or if it be, I cannot understand how it comes in here. But I need not wonder at the <hi>incoherence</hi> of M. <hi>Stubb</hi>'s Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; This must be allow'd him, or we shall never have done remarking: Let it be so then, <hi>In a sort of Tubes the Rays are brought to a Convergency in the first Glass, and again dilated in the second;</hi> Therefore the two Glasses are not so order'd in Perspectives that the <hi>visive Rays</hi> are <hi>better gather'd</hi> and <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> for the <hi>Advantage of Sight.</hi> This is the Argument in it's best Prospect, and let him make the most of it. I
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53427:93"/>
suppose, I need not tell the intelligent Reader how <hi>absurd</hi> it is, and how <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent</hi>; nor inform him, that by the <hi>Vnion</hi> of the <hi>visive Rays</hi> I do not mean their <hi>Coincidency,</hi> but <hi>such</hi> an <hi>Order</hi> among them as is fit for <hi>Vision.</hi> But I may further animadvert on these things hereafter, if upon second Thoughts I think them worthy of a further mention.</p>
            <p>After he had thus remarked my Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in <hi>Opticks,</hi> and proved it <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragably</hi> by the two Arguments I have now recited, He attempts to bring off his Friend M. <hi>Cross.</hi> He is a generous man, and told a Reverend Person from whom at second hand I had it, That he would <hi>rescue the poor Fellow out of my hands; nobly</hi> and <hi>charitably</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed! But let us see how he <hi>succeeds</hi> in this Design of <hi>Rescue</hi>; His first main Attempt follows here, [p. 28.] <hi>As to what M.</hi> Cross <hi>is said to have argued against Telescopes, that the Addition of one Glass to another must hinder, rather than improve Vision, because that the super adding of one pair of Spectacles to
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53427:94"/>
another, rather weakens than amends the Sight. I must say, that whosoever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands the Form of an Argument cannot except against the Form of that, nor do the Propositions so ill cohere together, as that one should be for Sense, the other for Convenience: All that Excursion of our Virtuoso shews his Ignorance, not M. Crosses.</hi> Thus the Defence begins, and is not M. <hi>Cross</hi> like to be <hi>rescued</hi>? The <hi>Form</hi> of the Argument is not to be <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted</hi> against: And pray M. <hi>Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,</hi> who talk'd of the <hi>Form</hi> of the <hi>Argument,</hi> or excepted against it? Doth M. <hi>Stubb</hi> intend <hi>this</hi> for a <hi>Defence,</hi> or doth he <hi>not</hi>? If <hi>not,</hi> what makes it <hi>here</hi>? If <hi>so,</hi> 'tis a <hi>rare knack,</hi> by which <hi>any</hi> thing may be defended. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, M. <hi>Stubb</hi> calls the Members of the <hi>Royal Society, Poor Devils,</hi> [<hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panella</hi> revived, p. 16.] And thus, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he forms his Arguments to prove it; If the <hi>Disasters</hi> of the <hi>late Dutch War,</hi> the <hi>Plague,</hi> and <hi>Fire of London</hi> were less <hi>Inconveniences</hi> than the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity</hi> of the <hi>Royal Society</hi>; Then the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53427:94"/>
Members thereof are <hi>Devils</hi>; But the <hi>Disasters of the late Dutch War, the Plague,</hi> and <hi>Fire of London were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Inconveniences than the perpetuity of the Royal Society,</hi> [Camp. rev. p. 21.] Ergo, There is no excepting against the <hi>Form</hi> of the Argument; <hi>conclusum est contra</hi>— Again, if <hi>They are pitiful Mechanicians,</hi> an <hi>illiterate Company, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postors, mean Spirits,</hi> &amp;c. then they are <hi>poor Devils</hi>; But they are <hi>pitiful Mechanicians,</hi> [Pref. against <hi>Plus Vlt.</hi>] an <hi>illiterate Company,</hi> [Camp. rev. p. 21.] <hi>Impostors,</hi> [Camp. rev. Pref.] <hi>mean Spirits,</hi> &amp;c. [Pref. against <hi>Plus Vlt.</hi>] Ergo, No one that <hi>understands the Form of an Argument can except against</hi> these; Nor <hi>do the Propositions so ill cohere, as that one should be for</hi> Sense, <hi>the other for</hi> Convenience. Whoever <hi>excepts</hi> against the Arguments shews <hi>his Ignorance,</hi> not M. <hi>Stubb</hi>'s, as I shewed <hi>mine,</hi> by <hi>excepting</hi> against the <hi>Reason</hi> taken from the <hi>Spectacles, not</hi> M. <hi>Crosses.</hi> How easily can M. <hi>Stubb</hi> prove a man guilty of <hi>Ignorance</hi>? Well! <hi>This</hi> is said
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53427:95"/>
in M. <hi>Crosses Defence,</hi> and I believe he could have said as much as <hi>this,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend <hi>himself.</hi> If he be called in question for the <hi>matter</hi> of his Argument, M. <hi>Stubb</hi> gives him up, and tells us, [ibid.] <hi>There is no Defence to be made for him,</hi> if he urged this otherwise than to <hi>try the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuals of M.</hi> Glanvill. Thus the <hi>Cause</hi> is quitted, and M. <hi>Cross</hi> left <hi>defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,</hi> only this was a <hi>sort of Knowledge that was not necessary for a Divine,</hi> and he hath other, and better <hi>Qualifications</hi> than <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reasoning.</hi> But since M. <hi>Cross</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be brought off, I must be charged; And that I as little understand the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Knowledge I pretend to, He saith it is <hi>manifest from hence,</hi> That I <hi>might easily have denied the Assertion of the Spectacles, that two pair did not impede, but amend the Sight in some Eyes that are very weak:</hi> For there is an <hi>old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,</hi> and a <hi>young Gentlewoman</hi> of his acquaintance that <hi>use two,</hi> [p. 29.] I shall here tell M. <hi>Stubb</hi> that there are very few things which I pretend to know: But whatever <hi>Ignorance</hi> I am
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53427:95"/>
guilty of, M. <hi>Stubb</hi> hath never the luck to discover it, nor to prove his charges against me of this kind. He <hi>remark'd</hi> that I was <hi>ignorant</hi> of <hi>Opticks,</hi> because I intimate that the <hi>Axiom, Vis unita for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tior,</hi> may be as well used to prove a man can write <hi>better</hi> with <hi>two Pens,</hi> than with <hi>one</hi>; as that he can <hi>see better</hi> with <hi>two Spectacles,</hi> than a single pair. I am charged with <hi>Ignorance</hi> for excepting against M. <hi>Crosses nonsensical</hi> Argument, which at last is given up as <hi>defenceless,</hi> and here it is <hi>manifest,</hi> that I understand not the Subject of the Knowledge I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, by as <hi>good</hi> reasons. Forsooth! I might easily have denied the Assertion of the <hi>Spectacles,</hi> that <hi>two pair</hi> did not <hi>impede,</hi> but <hi>amend</hi> the Sight in some Eyes that are weak. The Assertion was not that two pair did <hi>not,</hi> but that they <hi>did impede;</hi> But we must pass by M. <hi>Stubb</hi>'s <hi>Improprieties</hi> and <hi>Nonsense</hi>; and this Period is not <hi>Sense,</hi> as 'tis <hi>worded.</hi> He means, I might have <hi>denied</hi> that <hi>two pair</hi> of <hi>Spectacles hinder</hi> the Sight, they <hi>amend</hi> it in Eyes that are <hi>weak</hi>; Because
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53427:96"/>
I did not this I am <hi>ignorant</hi> in <hi>Opticks.</hi> But if I had done so, I had been <hi>imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> in <hi>answering</hi>; For it must be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that two pair ordinarily <hi>hinder</hi> the Sight, though in M. <hi>Stubb's old Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman</hi> and <hi>young,</hi> the Case is different, and if I had allowed the <hi>Consequence, this</hi> had been enough to have carried M. <hi>Cross's</hi> Cause against the two Glasses in <hi>Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopes.</hi> Thus I must be <hi>ignorant,</hi> because I was not <hi>impertinent.</hi> But doth M. <hi>Stubb</hi> think that every one is unacquainted with <hi>Opticks,</hi> who doth not <hi>know</hi> that <hi>double Spectacles</hi> mend the Sight in some whose <hi>Eyes are weak,</hi> or dis-affected? Must all be Ignoramus's that have not met with the <hi>old Gentlewoman</hi> his Acquaintance, and the <hi>young Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> that he knows with <hi>Cataracts</hi> in her Eyes, who use two <hi>pair of Spectacles</hi>? or must he needs be <hi>ignorant</hi> that meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>two false</hi> Propositions in a <hi>Syllogism,</hi> contents himself to deny <hi>one,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> the denial of which most evidently tends to the <hi>nulling</hi> the Argument, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring it <hi>ridiculous</hi>?

            </p>
            <p>But how comes M. <hi>Stubb</hi> to say in the Entrance of this Discourse, <hi>p.</hi> 29. That he was sure M. <hi>Boyle</hi> is in the <hi>same</hi> errour with M. <hi>Cross</hi>? Let us see upon what ground he built his <hi>Confidence</hi> in this first Instance by which he impugns <hi>Telescopes</hi>: Why, M. <hi>Boyle complains that when he went about to examine those appearances in the Sun call'd</hi> Maculae &amp; Faculae solares, <hi>he could not make the least Discovery of them in many Months, which yet other Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors pretend to see every day, yet doth M.</hi> Boyle <hi>profess that he neither wanted the conveniency of excellent Telescopes, nor omitted any circumstance requisite to the Enquiry.</hi> Thus the <hi>Animadverter;</hi> and <hi>hence</hi> he is <hi>sure</hi> that M. <hi>B.</hi> is in the <hi>same</hi> errour with M. <hi>C. That Telescopes are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious.</hi> Let this be an Instance how <hi>this Swaggerer</hi> quotes Authors, and let the Reader look into the place cited from
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:53427:97"/>
M. <hi>Boyle,</hi> If he do <hi>so,</hi> he will see, That that Honourable Person saith <hi>nothing there,</hi> that tends to the <hi>proving</hi> the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulness</hi> of <hi>Telescopes,</hi> much less, that he <hi>believes</hi> them <hi>fallacious.</hi> I have not the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> Translation of those <hi>Essays,</hi> but in the second Edition of the <hi>Original English,</hi> I find the Discourse to which M. <hi>Stubb</hi> referrs, <hi>p.</hi> 103. where the excellent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor imputes it <hi>not</hi> to the <hi>Glasses</hi> that he could not for several Months see the <hi>Macul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> and <hi>Faculae solares,</hi> but seems a little to blame those <hi>Astronomers,</hi> who <hi>have so written of the Spots and more shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning parts, — as to make their Readers to presume that at least some of them are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most always to be seen there,</hi> which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures was occasion'd by their so <hi>often meeting such Phaenomena in the Sun,</hi> [ib.] But <hi>these</hi> for many months, our Learned Author could not discover by his <hi>Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopes,</hi> not because of <hi>their Fallaciousness,</hi> but for that during many months <hi>they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared so much seldomer than it seems they did before.</hi> These are the words of that Honourable Gentleman, [<hi>ubi sup.</hi>] And

now how doth it appear hence that M. <hi>Boyle</hi> is in the <hi>same errour</hi> about the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulness of Telescopes,</hi> with M. <hi>Cross</hi>? Is it <hi>sure</hi> that <hi>he thought</hi> those Glasses <hi>fallacious,</hi> because he could not see the <hi>Maculae</hi> and <hi>Faculae</hi> in the Sun, <hi>when they were not there</hi>? what are we to expect from this man in reference to the <hi>other</hi> Authors he cites, when he so <hi>grosly</hi> and <hi>impudently</hi> mis-reports so known <hi>a one</hi> of our own, who is yet <hi>alive,</hi> and sees how <hi>maliciously</hi> the <hi>Caviller</hi> perverts him? I shall examine his carriage to other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in my next Book; and in that shew that most of the Arguments he brings to argue the <hi>Fallaciousness</hi> of <hi>Telescopes,</hi> prove only the <hi>Diversity</hi> and <hi>Changes</hi> of the <hi>Mediums,</hi> and of the <hi>celestial Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> not the <hi>Deceit</hi> of <hi>those Glasses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I am concluded to be altogether <hi>unacquainted</hi> with <hi>Telescopes,</hi> as well as <hi>ignorant</hi> of <hi>Opticks,</hi> [p. 46.] because I say, That [<hi>They alter the Objects in nothing but their Proportions.</hi>] by which I meant, that they make no <hi>Alterations</hi> in the <hi>Figures</hi> of Bodies, but represent them, as they are,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53427:98"/>
only in <hi>larger</hi> proportions. And I am <hi>ignorant</hi> in <hi>Telescopes,</hi> for saying <hi>so,</hi> For (1.) <hi>Some Telescopes invert all Objects,</hi> and (2.) the <hi>Dioptrick Tubes</hi> represent the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Colours</hi> more <hi>dilute</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss,</hi> (3.) Some <hi>represent some Objects greater,</hi> (4.) Some <hi>no bigger,</hi> or rather <hi>less,</hi> (5.) Some Objects are <hi>magnified,</hi> but <hi>not so much as others.</hi> These are Arguments of my <hi>Ignorance,</hi> or M. <hi>Stubb</hi>'s <hi>Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence:</hi> For my <hi>Ignorance,</hi> I have told M. <hi>Stubb,</hi> that I am ready to confess a great deal <hi>more,</hi> than he can prove me guilty of; And whether he hath shewn it <hi>here,</hi> as he pretends, let the Reader judg. If <hi>some Telescopes invert</hi> all things, that's nothing to his purpose, for I spoke of the <hi>ordinary Tubes</hi>; Nor is there any change of the <hi>Figure</hi> of Objects, when they are <hi>inverted.</hi> Though in the <hi>largest</hi> Tubes the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Colours</hi> are more <hi>remiss;</hi> yet that makes <hi>no alteration</hi> of the Object, and I said the Glasses <hi>alter'd</hi> the <hi>Objects</hi> in <hi>nothing</hi> but their Proportions. Though <hi>some Objects</hi> in <hi>some Tubes</hi> are represented <hi>no bigger,</hi> or rather <hi>less,</hi> than they <hi>other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise</hi>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:53427:99"/>
seem; yet that's nothing against what I say, For <hi>Telescopes ordinarily mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie,</hi> 'Tis their remarkable property, and <hi>that</hi> for which they are used; and though <hi>some Objects</hi> are <hi>not magnified</hi> as much as <hi>others,</hi> yet they are confess'd to be <hi>mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified,</hi> and that's <hi>sufficient</hi>; or though <hi>some</hi> are <hi>not,</hi> 'twere <hi>nothing,</hi> as I just now observ'd. I note these obvious things as my eye runs over my Adversaries Book. They are enough to justifie what I said, and to shew M. <hi>Stubb</hi>'s <hi>Impertinence</hi>; I shall discover it further, when I come to consider these things more deeply. I represent the easiest matters <hi>now,</hi> that all Readers may see what a pitiful Caviller this man is, that boasts such mighty matters, and counts all men <hi>ignorants,</hi> and <hi>Fools,</hi> but himself.</p>
            <p n="13">(13.) And 'tis notoriously evident in this <hi>next</hi> Instance, I had said, [<hi>Chymistry hath a Pretence to the great Hermes for its Author,</hi> (<hi>how truly I will not dispute,</hi>) But M. <hi>Stubb</hi> will make me dispute whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I will or no. For after he had recited <hi>these</hi> words he saith, he can tell me what
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53427:99"/>
he is <hi>sure</hi> I am ignorant of. <hi>The Egyptians did never attribute to Hermes the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Physick or any part of it,</hi> — p. 50.] How doth this Scribbler confute his own Dreams? who said that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> attribute to <hi>Hermes</hi> the Invention of <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,</hi> or <hi>any part</hi> of it? How easie is it to pile up Authors against any Writer, if a man may take this Liberty of making him say what he pleaseth?

admirabilem à me jampridem Inventum, video propemodum omnibus placuisse,</hi> — M. <hi>Stubb</hi> tells us, That <hi>His Ambition of Glory made him willing to be thought the Author of a Paradox he had so illustrated,—yet such was his Modesty as not to vindicate it to himself by telling a Lie;</hi> [ubi sup.] This we see he did if <hi>Cesal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinus</hi> was the <hi>Author.</hi> That this last named Person was the <hi>Inventer</hi> of the <hi>Circulation,</hi> M. <hi>Stubb</hi> labours much to prove, and struts mightily in his supposed performance; I shall not undertake to examine that matter now, only I cannot but take notice, that M. <hi>Stubb</hi> is <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent</hi> in all that Discourse: For if <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salpinus</hi> be the <hi>Author,</hi> the <hi>Invention</hi> is however <hi>modern,</hi> for he writ his <hi>Quaest. Medicae</hi> not above eighty years ago, and in them it is pretended he discover'd the <hi>Circulation.</hi> And I am the less concern'd in all the Animadverters <hi>voluminous No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> about the Author of that <hi>Discovery,</hi> because I took care before to <hi>prevent</hi> such <hi>Impertinences</hi>; but I see M. <hi>Stubb</hi> will be <hi>impertinent,</hi> do I what I can to prevent it.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53427:101"/>
I ascribe the <hi>Invention</hi> to D. <hi>Harvy,</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all men now do, except the <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter</hi>; but take notice withal, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divers Antients, but <hi>some Moderns have had the Glory fastned on them,</hi> among these, I mention <hi>this CAESALPINVS,</hi> and add, [<hi>For</hi> these <hi>though either of them should be acknowledg'd to be the Author, it will make as much for the Design of my Discourse, as if</hi> Harvy <hi>have the Credit; and therefore here I am no otherwise concern'd, but to have ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice for that excellent man,</hi> — Plus Ult. <hi>p.</hi> 16.] But M. <hi>Stubb</hi>'s malice against Dr. <hi>Harvy,</hi> and spight against me would not permit him to discern that he had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son here to fall on <hi>this</hi> Controversie; and 'tis nothing to him whether he <hi>have</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or <hi>not;</hi> He follows the <hi>Impetus,</hi> and writes on, if it happen to be to <hi>purpose,</hi> 'tis <hi>well,</hi> if <hi>not,</hi> he cannot help it.</p>
            <p>AND now, Sir, I am quite weary of discovering the <hi>Falshoods,</hi> and <hi>Follies,</hi> and <hi>Impertinences</hi> of this <hi>insulting</hi> man. The <hi>Instances</hi> I have given are enough for my present purpose; <hi>They</hi> will more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly appear in the further <hi>Animadversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>

I intend, in those I shall take all things to task, in which I may be thought to be concerned. But for <hi>that</hi> work I must have time; I have other things enow to do, which 'tis more my Concern and more my Inclination to mind; And <hi>that</hi> Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness will require me to examine a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of <hi>Authors,</hi> which I have reason to be confident M. <hi>Stubb</hi> hath <hi>mis-reported</hi> and <hi>abus'd</hi>; I have given you a taste already of some of his dealings with the <hi>Writers</hi> he quotes, I shall present the World with a great deal more of the same kind in my next ingagement. But that will be a thing of Labour, and 'tis not so agreeable to my humour neither, and therefore the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this my Design will be the <hi>slower.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Thought here to have added an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my <hi>other</hi> Antagonist M. <hi>Cross</hi>; But <hi>that</hi> Adversary is to be <hi>pitied, all</hi> that <hi>he</hi> can do in the Controversie is but to <hi>call Names</hi> and <hi>invent Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and make <hi>scurrilous Rhimes</hi>; These are the <hi>Arms</hi> he hath used against me, ever since our Controversie began; I
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:53427:102"/>
speak not <hi>this</hi> in a way of <hi>contemptuous</hi> Abuse, but with all that seriousness, with which I can affirm any thing, which I do most heartily believe. <hi>This</hi> I say (and I am sorry I can say no better of him) hath been the course he hath taken: I repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented the Contents of his Book in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Letter to Dr. <hi>Ingelo,</hi> that afterwards, coming to a Friends hands in <hi>London</hi> was <hi>printed</hi> by him, and call'd the <hi>Chue Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zett,</hi> (for M. <hi>Cross</hi> lives at a place call'd <hi>Chue.</hi>) It was <hi>printed,</hi> but there were not an hundred <hi>Copies</hi> of it, and <hi>those all</hi> given into private hands, that his <hi>shame</hi> might not be made <hi>publick.</hi> In <hi>that</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I presented a <hi>Collection</hi> of some of the <hi>Names</hi> he had call'd me, which were as <hi>foul</hi> and <hi>scurrilous,</hi> as the most ill-bred <hi>Ruffian</hi> could have vented in a <hi>distemper'd Huff;</hi> I recited about sixteen of his <hi>gross Falshoods,</hi> which were the <hi>broadest</hi> and <hi>sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest</hi> that ever were framed, for they were so <hi>pitifully</hi> contrived, that every one that knows me, knew <hi>most</hi> of them to be <hi>false,</hi> and he himself could not but <hi>know,</hi> that they were <hi>notoriously</hi> untrue; yea, <hi>some
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:53427:103"/>
passages</hi> of things he had said, which he publickly denied again in his Book, and with most solemn <hi>Invocations</hi> of the name of God, have been attested to his face. So that I am as much astonisht at the <hi>prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Indiscretion</hi> of this <hi>marvellous</hi> man, as at his matchless <hi>Legends.</hi> And in him I see an Instance how far <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi> will carry a <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>intemperate</hi> Spirit. He did not <hi>know</hi> nor <hi>care</hi> what he said, so he could gratifie his <hi>wild</hi> Passion against me. If ever you chance to light upon <hi>that</hi> Paper, you will see that this Censure is <hi>sober</hi> and <hi>true.</hi> In the same Letter I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the <hi>contemptible Impertinency</hi> of his Book, which <hi>doth</hi> not as much against <hi>mine,</hi> as M. <hi>Stubb did,</hi> when he <hi>confuted</hi> the <hi>Errata</hi> of the <hi>Press.</hi> I give a <hi>Specimen</hi> also of the <hi>Learning</hi> he shews in <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scraps,</hi> and <hi>little ends</hi> of <hi>Verse,</hi> and <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Phrases,</hi> which are all the <hi>Reading</hi> he discovers. These things are in brief re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented in the Gazett, and much more largely in a <hi>Latin</hi> Account of his Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, which I have ready by me.</p>
            <p>After my <hi>Letter</hi> was abroad, to divert
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53427:103"/>
his Trouble and Disorder, he fell into a fit of <hi>Rhiming,</hi> and writ <hi>scurrilous Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lads</hi> to abuse me further; upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion he was so given to <hi>versifying,</hi> that he could not write a Note but it must be in Meeter. As for instance, sending to a Neighbour Minister to preach for him, he presents his Request thus,
<q>
                  <l>Good M. Battin,</l>
                  <l>You speak good Latin,</l>
                  <l>And so you do English too:</l>
                  <l>Your Neighbour Cross</l>
                  <l>Is taking Horse,</l>
                  <l>And you must preach at Chue.</l>
               </q>
With such <hi>Poetry</hi> as <hi>this, my</hi> Praises, and <hi>those</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Bath,</hi> were celebrated. And so <hi>taken</hi> he was <hi>himself</hi> with his vein, that I have heard, he used to vaunt how much he was in a <hi>Poetick Dispensation</hi> above <hi>Hudibras.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the likeliest course he ever took, was the ingaging M. <hi>Stubb</hi> in his Quarrel. <hi>He</hi> hath a Pen that is always ready to be

retain'd in <hi>pay.</hi> M. <hi>Cross</hi> (as I was told by the Animadverter himself) sent him his Book, which he then despised; and said even to me, that he was an <hi>old — that had been asleep these forty years, and knew not what the World had been doing</hi>; But 'tis like M. <hi>Stubb</hi> did not know <hi>then,</hi> what <hi>Advantage</hi> might be made of M. <hi>Crosses Friendship,</hi> by one that would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake his <hi>rescue.</hi> The <hi>Reverend Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputer</hi> after <hi>this caress'd,</hi> and <hi>courted</hi> him highly; <hi>treated</hi> him at <hi>Bath,</hi> and <hi>enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd</hi> him divers times with <hi>dear</hi> wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come at his House, so that at last <hi>he</hi> was <hi>fastned.</hi> How <hi>like</hi> these two are in their Genius's and Performances, I may have an occasion to shew in a <hi>parallel.</hi> What Assistance M. <hi>Cross</hi> can afford his Friend in the <hi>Cause</hi> against the Royal Society, he shall not want: I am told, that he is doing <hi>that,</hi> which is sutable to his <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> and <hi>Abilities,</hi> viz. <hi>collecting</hi> the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends,</hi> that <hi>Himself</hi> and his <hi>Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates</hi> have made and driven about con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>one</hi> of those, they call the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuosi,</hi> to furnish M. <hi>Stubb</hi> with them;

            <p>And now while I am speaking of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends,</hi> I remember <hi>one,</hi> by which I have been much abused to the <hi>GENTRY</hi> of <hi>WILTS,</hi> as if I had spoken rudely and injuriously concerning them. <hi>You,</hi> Sir, are of <hi>that</hi> County; and I owe a <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> of my self to <hi>you,</hi> and <hi>those</hi> other <hi>ingenious</hi> and <hi>worthy</hi> Persons, who have heard the <hi>Fable.</hi> The occasion of the the <hi>false</hi> Report, which 'tis like you have been told, was this, I commended an Honourable <hi>Gentleman</hi> of <hi>your</hi> County, and <hi>particularly</hi> for his Skill in <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> adding, that <hi>I knew none other in the parts</hi> where I was then, (being not in <hi>Wiltshire</hi>) <hi>so</hi> acquainted with <hi>those</hi> Studies; or to that purpose; This hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be mistaken and mis-reported, and <hi>after</hi> coming to the ears of <hi>some,</hi> whose <hi>Tongues are their own,</hi> they formed it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that <hi>abusive Falshood</hi> that went about.

            <p>MR. <hi>Stubbe</hi> being resolv'd to <hi>charge the Enemy home,</hi> (as he told us) hath publish't two other Books, since <hi>that</hi> against me; The <hi>First</hi> he calls <hi>LEGENDS NO HISTORIES,</hi> against Dr. <hi>Spratt,</hi> and M. <hi>Henshaw</hi>; The <hi>other</hi> he names <hi>CAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PANELLA REVIV'D,</hi> design'd to prove, That the Royal Society is managing projects to introduce <hi>Popery:</hi> In these worthy works I cannot tell which I shall admire <hi>most,</hi> his <hi>impudence,</hi> or his <hi>impertinence</hi>; The <hi>former</hi> will sufficiently appear in the bare recital of some of his expressions, which I shall present for a Taste; The <hi>other</hi> vertue will require <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions,</hi> which I suppose the Gentleman concern'd may bestow upon the <hi>Legends</hi>; and the <hi>other</hi> Pamphlet I may perhaps take an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to examine. The shorter work I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take <hi>now,</hi> as a Supplement to my Account of M. <hi>Stubbe</hi>'s <hi>modesty,</hi> and <hi>civilities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the <hi>First</hi> thing I take notice of, <hi>is,</hi> That this <hi>doughty</hi> man of <hi>Warwick</hi> sends publick <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiances</hi> before-hand, to those he intends to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault, and, as I have read somewhere of the <hi>Great Turk,</hi> in the <hi>pride</hi> of his <hi>puissance</hi> gives <hi>solemn warning</hi> where he intends to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:53427:106"/>
make <hi>War</hi>: 'Tis unbecoming his mightiness to surprise an Enemy. He therefore informs M. <hi>Evelyn,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Merrett</hi> what he <hi>intends</hi> against them [<hi>Camp. rev.</hi>] which is somewhat less, it seems, then he <hi>could</hi> do, should he give <hi>himself the trouble</hi>; For he saith, he could <hi>make M.</hi> Evelyn'<hi>s account of the Birch Tree appear as ridiculous, as the History of Salt-Petre</hi>; 'Tis like he understands <hi>that</hi> Tree, He <hi>experimented</hi> something more than <hi>ordinary</hi> of <hi>it</hi> at <hi>Oxford</hi>; and perhaps if he had right done him, he would have more experience of another <hi>Tree.</hi> But I must not stay, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark here. He gives out, That he will make the Lord Bishop of <hi>CHESTER smart,</hi> and writ to one (as I am credibly told) that he was making <hi>inquiries into his Lordships Learning, parts, and qualifications for a Bishop.</hi> How <hi>fit</hi> is he to be a <hi>visitour</hi> of Bishops? But to confine my self to what is printed.</p>
            <p>He gives notice in the <hi>Preface</hi> of his <hi>Legends</hi> of several Books more, that he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in pursuance of the Projects of his <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>; Particularly he threatens <hi>one</hi> against my <hi>LETTER</hi> concerning <hi>ARISTO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TLE</hi>; a <hi>Design</hi> suitable to the <hi>Grandeur</hi> of M. <hi>Stubbe</hi>'s <hi>mind.</hi> That short Discourse was first only a <hi>private Letter,</hi> written when I was not 23 years of Age, and printed six, or seven years ago. Let the mighty man, in the glory of his conquests, insult over an <hi>essay</hi> of a
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:53427:106"/>
               <hi>green</hi> youth, and take six years time to write against two sheets of Paper, which for ought he can tell the Author by this time disrellish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himself. But the truth is, I do not know, whether I have any reason to do so, or not, having not read it over since. Whatever <hi>other</hi> faults there may be in the Composure, I'm sure there is no <hi>Lying,</hi> as M. <hi>Stubbe</hi> charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, according to the <hi>usual way</hi> of his <hi>civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> I reported no matter of Fact concerning <hi>Aristotle</hi> or his <hi>Philosophy,</hi> but from some good and approved Author; though perhaps I should find trouble now in the <hi>particular</hi> citations, because I want the opportunity of those Books that I then used, and I have lost the Notes that I took from them. Whether it will be worth my Labour to answer what M. <hi>Stubbe</hi> shall write against that <hi>young exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise</hi> of my Pen.

            <p>Further, in the Preface thus, [<hi>Nor would I have any man believe that there are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eminent Physicians of the Royal Society, for neither is the number of those admitted conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi> (I find 30 Doctors of Physick in the last years Catalogue, and <hi>many</hi> if not <hi>most</hi> of them of the <hi>Colledge,</hi>) <hi>Few of note, but have deserted it again; The rest approve not</hi> of <hi>it,</hi> so <hi>that all the talk will not amount to three under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> persons.] I am assured, that 'tis false that any of <hi>note,</hi> except one or two have <hi>deserted</hi> it, and <hi>M.

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:53427:110"/>
Needham, Dr. Iasp. Needham, Dr. Clerk, Dr. Allen, Dr. Horshaw, Dr. Merrett, Dr. Croon, Dr. Power, Dr. Trustan: one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> of these are <hi>understanding</hi> persons, <hi>M. Stubbe</hi> saith, <hi>not three</hi>; would he tell us now which are the <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> that have <hi>understanding</hi> among them; At this rate <hi>M. Stubbe</hi> makes the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of <hi>Physicians</hi> as <hi>illiterate</hi> a <hi>Company,</hi> as the <hi>Virtuosi</hi>; And let <hi>any one</hi> in that <hi>famed body</hi> of <hi>Learned men,</hi> be named in opposition to any thing he shall think fit to say, and <hi>that</hi> person, be he who he will, shall be cast among the <hi>Fools,</hi> and <hi>Illiterate.</hi> I have more reason for <hi>this</hi> saying then I'le mention here. <hi>All</hi> the <hi>famous Doctors</hi> named excepting <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two,</hi> are <hi>Prattle-boxes</hi> and <hi>Ignoramus's</hi>; who can scape the <hi>lash</hi> of <hi>such</hi> a <hi>Tongue?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I had almost forgot, that to shew his candour and good nature he <hi>acknowledgeth some</hi> of the <hi>Society.</hi> For he saith in the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> to his <hi>Legends,</hi> That <hi>he must be insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all merit that can derogate from Sir Rob. Moray, Dr. Wren, and Dr. Wallis, and it doth not</hi> (he tells us) <hi>become any one that knows M. Boyle, to think that he would abet a design to subvert Piety, and the Protestant Religion.</hi> It seems he allows <hi>Sir R. M. Dr. Wren</hi> and <hi>Dr. Wallis</hi> to be <hi>understanding</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and rather then <hi>leave out</hi> M. <hi>Boyle,</hi> he shall be brought in <hi>too,</hi> though but for a <hi>nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive merit. These</hi> are the <hi>excepted persons</hi> that
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:53427:110"/>
have the <hi>hon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>r</hi> of some place in his <hi>favour</hi>: The <hi>rest</hi> are <hi>Virtuosi,</hi> and <hi>deserve all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt with which we depretiate the</hi> Illiterate and Fools. But how comes <hi>Dr. Wallis</hi> that was branded by him with so many charges of <hi>illiterateness</hi> and <hi>ignorance,</hi> and all things else of contempt, as we have seen, how comes this Gentleman <hi>now</hi> to be <hi>so highly</hi> in his Books? It seems the Doctor is exceedingly improved in 10 or 11 years, and hath got a great stock of <hi>merit, since</hi> M. <hi>Stubbe</hi> writ against him; or rather men shall have <hi>merit</hi> when M. <hi>Stubbe</hi> pleaseth, and when he <hi>pleaseth,</hi> they shall have <hi>none.</hi> 'Tis to be hoped that the <hi>rest</hi> of the <hi>Virtuosi</hi> in ten years <hi>more,</hi> may get a <hi>little merit</hi> too, and obtain from him at least a <hi>negative</hi> commendation.</p>
            <p>And now what can any one think that reads <hi>these</hi> passages, but that <hi>M. Stubbe</hi> is <hi>over-heated</hi> in his head? This is the most cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable thought can be entertain'd of him. I expect that hereafter he should make it his <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse,</hi> and certainly 'twill be a <hi>better Apology</hi> then <hi>that</hi> of <hi>serving a Patron.</hi>
            </p>
