            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Author's PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THere is a general Belief, that the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> was at firſt an Imitation of the Aſſembly of the Three Eſtates in <hi>France:</hi> therefore, in order to prepare the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the Recerche we have in hand, it is proper to give a brief Accompt of the mode of <hi>France</hi> in thoſe Aſſemblies: <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> being alſo under the Dominion of the King of <hi>England;</hi> a Touch of the manner of their Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhall be by way of Preface.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> In <hi>France,</hi> the Kings Writ goeth to the Bailiffs, Seneſchals, or Stewards of Liberties, who iſſue out Warrants to all
<pb facs="tcp:93433:4"/>
ſuch as have Fees and Lands within their Liberties, and to all Towns, requiring all ſuch as have any <hi>Complaints,</hi> to meet in the Principal City, there to chooſe two or three Delegates, in the name of that Province, to be preſent at the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>At the day appointed, they meet at the Principal City of the Bailiwick. The King's Writ is read, and every man called by name, and ſworn to chooſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men, for the good of the King and Commonwealth, to be preſent at the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſembly, as Delegates, faithfully to deliver their <hi>Grievances,</hi> and <hi>Demands</hi> of the Province. Then they chooſe their Delegates, and ſwear them. Next, they conſult what is neceſſary to be complained of, or what is to be deſired of the King: and of theſe things they make a Catalogue or <hi>Index.</hi> And becauſe every man ſhould freely propound his <hi>Complaint</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi> there is a Cheſt placed in the
<pb facs="tcp:93433:4"/>
Town-Hall, into which every man may caſt his Writing. After the Catalogue is made and Signed, it is delivered to the Delegates to carry to the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly.</p>
            <p>All the Bailiwicks are divided into twelve Claſſes. To avoid confuſion, and to the end there may not be too great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay in the Aſſembly, by the Gathering of all the Votes, every Claſſis compiles a Catalogue or Book of the <hi>Grievances</hi> and <hi>Demands</hi> of all the Bailiwicks within that Claſſis, then theſe Claſſes at the Aſſembly compoſe one Book of the <hi>Grievances</hi> and <hi>Demands</hi> of the whole Kingdom. This being the order of the Proceedings of the third Eſtate; the like order is obſerved by the Clergy and Nobility. When the three Books for the three Eſtates are perfected, then they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them to the King by their Preſidents. Firſt, the Preſident for the Clergy begins his Oration on his knees, and the King
<pb facs="tcp:93433:5"/>
commanding, he ſtands up bare-headed, and proceeds. And ſo the next Preſident for the Nobility doth the like. But the Preſident for the Commons begins and ends his Oration on his knees. Whilſt the Preſident for the Clergy ſpeaks, the reſt of that Order riſe up, and ſtand bare, till they are bid by the King to ſit down, and be covered, and ſo the like for the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. But whilſt the Preſident of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ſpeaks, the reſt are neither bidden to ſit, or be covered. Thus the <hi>Grievances</hi> and <hi>Demands</hi> being delivered, and left to the King and His Council, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſembly of the three Eſtates endeth, <hi>Atque ita totus actus concluditur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it appears, the General Aſſembly was but an orderly way of preſenting the Publick <hi>Grievances</hi> and <hi>Demands</hi> of the whole Kingdom, to the conſideration of the King: Not much unlike the antient <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage of this Kingdom for a long time, when all Laws were nothing elſe but the
<pb facs="tcp:93433:5"/>
King's Anſwers to the Petitions preſented to Him in Parliament, as is apparent by very many Statutes, Parliament-Rolls, and the Confeſſion of Sir <hi>Edw. Coke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> In <hi>Scotland,</hi> about twenty days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Parliament begins, Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made throughout the Kingdom, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver in to the King's Clerk, or Maſter of the Rolls, all Bills to be exhibited that Seſſions, before a certain day: then are they brought to the King, and peruſed by Him: and only ſuch as he allows are put into the Chancellour's hand, to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in Parliament, and none others: And if any man in Parliament ſpeak of another matter than is allowed by the King, the Chancellor tells him, there is no ſuch Bill allowed by the King. When they have paſſed them for Laws, they are preſented to the King, who, with his Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter put into His hand by the Chancellor, ratifies them, and if there be any thing the King diſlikes, they raze it out before.</p>

               <hi>3.</hi> In <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Parliament, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by a Statute made in the Tenth year of <hi>Hen. 7. c. 4.</hi> is to be after this manner: No Parliament is to be holden but at ſuch Seaſon as the King's Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Council there, do firſt certifie the King, under the Great Seal of that Land, the Cauſes and Conſiderations, and all ſuch Acts as they think fit ſhould paſs in the ſaid Parliament. And ſuch Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Conſiderations, and Acts affirmed by the King and his Council to be good and expedient for that Land: And His Licence thereupon as well in affirmation of the ſaid Cauſes and Acts, as to ſummon the Parliament under His Great Seal of <hi>England</hi> had and obtained. That done, a Parliament to be had and holden after the Form and Effect afore-rehearſed, and if any Parliament be holden in that Land contrary to the Form and Proviſion afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, it is deemed void, and of none. Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in Law. It is provided, that all ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:93433:6"/>
Bills as ſhall be offered to the Parliament there; ſhall be firſt tranſmitted hither under the Great Seal of that Kingdom, and having received Allowance and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation here, ſhall be put under the Great Seal of this Kingdom, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned thither to be preferred to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. By a Statute of <hi>3</hi> and <hi>4</hi> of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> for the expounding of <hi>Poynings</hi> Act, it is ordered, for the King's Paſſing of the ſaid Acts in ſuch Form and Tenor as they ſhould be ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England,</hi> or elſe for the Change of them, or any part of them.</p>
            <p>After this ſhorter Narrative of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>

                  <p>By this Writ we do not find that the Commons are called to be any part of the <hi>Common Councel</hi> of the Kingdom, or of the <hi>Supream Court of Judicature,</hi> or to have any part of the <hi>Legiſlative Power,</hi> or to Conſult <hi>de arduis regni negotiis,</hi> of the Difficult Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the Kingdom. The Writ only ſays, the King would have <hi>Conference,</hi> and <hi>Treat</hi> with the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, Great men,</hi> and <hi>Peers:</hi> but not a Word of Treating or Conference with the Commons; The Houſe of Commons, which doth not miniſter an Oath, nor fine, nor impriſon any, but their own Members (and that but of late in ſome Caſes) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not properly be ſaid to be a Court at all; much leſs to be a part of the Supream Court, or higheſt Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature of the Kingdom. The conſtant Cuſtom, even to this day, for the Members of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to ſtand bare, with their Hats in their Hands in the Preſence of the Lords, while the Lords ſit co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered at all Conferences, is a viſible Argument, that the Lords and Commons are not fellow-Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, or fellow-Counſellors of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>The Duty of Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes, mentioned in the Writ, is only <hi>ad Faciendum, &amp; Conſentiendum,</hi> to <hi>Perform</hi> and to <hi>Conſent</hi> to ſuch things as ſhould be ordained by the <hi>Common Councel</hi> of the Kingdom; there is not ſo much mentioned in the Writ as a Power in the Commons to diſſent. When a man is bound to appear in a Court of Juſtice, the words are, <hi>ad Faciendum &amp; Recipiendum quod ei per curiam injungetur:</hi> which ſhews, that this Word <hi>Faciendum</hi> is uſed as a Term in Law, to ſignifie <hi>to give Obedience:</hi> For this, we meet with a Precedent even as ancient as the Parliament-Writ it ſelf, and it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93433:12"/>
is concerning Proceedings in Parliament 33 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. <hi>Dominus Rex mandavit vicecom' quod, &amp;c. ſummon' Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaum de Segrave, &amp; ex parte Domini Regis firmiter ei injungeret, quod eſſet coram Domino Rege in proximo Parl. &amp;c. ad audiendum voluntatem ipſius Domini Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis, &amp;c. Et ad faciendum &amp; recipiendum ulterius quod curia Domini Regis conſideraret in Praemiſſis.</hi>
                     <q>Our Lord the King commands the Sheriff to ſummon <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Segrave</hi> to appear before our Lord the King in the next Parliament, to hear the Will of the Lord our King himſelf, and to perform and receive what the Kings Court ſhall further conſider of the Premiſes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Edw. Coke,</hi> to prove the Clergy hath no Voice in Parliament, ſaith, that by the Words of their Writ, <hi>their Conſent was only to ſuch things as were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the Common Councel of the Realm.</hi> If this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of his be good, it will deny alſo Voices to the Commons in Parliament; for in their Writ are the ſelf-ſame Words, <hi>viz. to conſent to ſuch things as were ordained by the Common Councel of the Kingdom.</hi> Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> concludes, that the <hi>Procuratores Cleri, have many times appeared in Parliament,</hi> as <hi>Spiritual Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, to Conſider, Conſult, and to Conſent</hi>; but never had Voice there; how they could Conſult and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent without Voices he doth not ſhew: Though <hi>the Clergy</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>oft appeared in Parliament,</hi> yet was it only <hi>ad conſentiendum,</hi> as I take it, and not <hi>ad fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciendum,</hi> for the Word <hi>Faciendum</hi> is omitted in their Writ; the cauſe, as I conceive, is, the Clergy, though they were to <hi>aſſent,</hi> yet by reaſon of <hi>Clerical Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> they were not required to <hi>Perform</hi> all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances or Acts of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may think, though the Writ doth not expreſs a Calling of the Knights, Citizens, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93433:12"/>
Burgeſſes to be part of the <hi>Common Councel</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi>; yet it ſuppoſeth it a thing granted, and not to be queſtioned, but that they are a part of the <hi>Common Councel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed if their Writ had not mentioned the Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Prelates, Great men, and Peers to Councel, there might have been a little better colour for ſuch a Suppoſition: but the truth is, ſuch a Suppoſition doth make the Writ it ſelf vain and idle; for it is a ſenſeleſs thing to bid men aſſent to that which they have already ordained: ſince Ordaining is an Aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and more than an Aſſenting.</p>
                  <p>For clearing the meaning and ſenſe of the Writ, and Satisfaction of ſuch as think it impoſſible, but that the Commons of <hi>England</hi> have always been a part of the <hi>Common Councel of the Kingdom,</hi> I ſhall inſiſt upon theſe Points: 1. That anciently the <hi>Barons of</hi> England <hi>were the Common Councel of the Kingdom.</hi> 2. That un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. the Commons were not called to Parliament. 3. Though the Commons were called by <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. yet they were not conſtantly called, nor yet regularly elected by Writ until <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. time.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt point, Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> in his <hi>Britannia,</hi> doth teach us, that <hi>in the time of the Engliſh Saxons, and in the enſuing Age, a Parliament was called Commune Concilium,</hi> which was (ſaith he) <hi>Praeſentia Regis, Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latorum, Procerumque collectorum,</hi> the Preſence of the King, Prelates, and Peers aſſembled; No mention of the Commons: the Prelates and Peers were all Barons.</p>
                  <p>The Author of the Chronicle of the Church of <hi>Lichfield,</hi> cited by M. <hi>Selden,</hi>
                     <note rend="inter">Apud Selden.</note> ſaith, <hi>Poſtquam Rex Edvardus, &amp;c. Concilio Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Angliae,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>After King</hi> Edward <hi>was King; by the Councel of the Barons of</hi> England, <hi>he revived a

                  </p>
                  <p>In the ſame Chronicle it is ſaid, that <hi>Will.</hi> the Conquerour, <hi>anno regni ſui quarto apud Londin</hi>', had <hi>Concilium Baronum ſuorum,</hi> a Councel of his Barons.

                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:93433:15"/>Here the Place of <hi>Bracton,</hi> Chief Juſtice in this Kings time, is worth the obſerving; and the rather for that it is much inſiſted on of late, to make for Parliaments being above the King. The words in <hi>Bracton</hi> are, <hi>The King hath a Superiour, God; alſo the Law by which he is made King; alſo his Court,</hi> viz. <hi>the Earls and Barons.</hi> The Court that was ſaid in thoſe days to be above the King, was a Court of <hi>Earls and Barons,</hi> not a word of the Commons, or the repreſentative Body of the Kingdom being any part of the Superiour Court. Now for the true Senſe of <hi>Bractons</hi> words, how the Law, and the Court of <hi>Earls and Barons,</hi> are the Kings Superiours; they muſt of Neceſſity be underſtood to be Superiours, ſo far only as to adviſe, and direct the King out of his own Grace and Good Will only: which appears plainly by the Words of <hi>Bracton</hi> himſelf, where, ſpeaking of the King, he reſolves thus, <hi>Nec poteſt ei neceſſitatem aliquis imponere quod injuriam ſuam corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat &amp; emendat, cum ſuperiorem non habeat niſi Deum; &amp; ſatis ei erat ad poenam, quod Dominum expectat ultorem.</hi> Nor can any man put a neceſſity upon him to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and amend his Injury unleſs he will himſelf, ſince he hath no Superiour but God; it will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Puniſhment for him, to expect the Lord an Avenger. Here the ſame man, who ſpeaking accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſome mens Opinion, ſaith, the <hi>Law and Court of Earls and Barons</hi> are ſuperiour to the <hi>King</hi>; in this place tells us himſelf, the <hi>King hath no Superiour but God:</hi> the Difference is eaſily reconciled; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Diſtinction of the School-men, <hi>the King is free from the Coactive Power of Laws or Counſellors:</hi> but <hi>may be ſubject to their Directive Power,</hi> according to his own Will: that is, God can only compel,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93433:15"/>
but the Law and his Courts may adviſe Him.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Precedents ſhew, that from the Conqueſt until a great part of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third's Reign (in whoſe days it is thought the Writ for Election of Knights was framed) which is about two hundred years, and above a third part of the time ſince the Conqueſt, to our days, the <hi>Barons</hi> made the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> or <hi>Common Councel of the Kingdom</hi>; under the name of <hi>Barons,</hi> not only the <hi>Earls,</hi> but the <hi>Biſhops</hi> alſo were Comprehended, for the Conquerour made the Biſhops <hi>Barons.</hi> Therefore it is no ſuch great Wonder, that in the Writ we find the <hi>Lords</hi> only to be the <hi>Counſellors,</hi> and the <hi>Commons</hi> Called only to <hi>perform</hi> and <hi>conſent</hi> to the <hi>Ordinances.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe there be who ſeem to believe, that under the word <hi>Barons</hi> anciently the Lords of Court-Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons were comprehended, and that they were Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to Parliament as <hi>Barons</hi>; but if this could be proved to have been at any time true, yet thoſe Lords of Court-Barons were not the repreſentative Body of the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> except it can be alſo proved, that the Commons, or Free-holders of the Kingdom, choſe ſuch Lords of Court-Barons to be preſent in Parliament. The Lords of Manors came not at firſt by Election of the People, as Sir <hi>Edw. Coke,</hi> treating of the Inſtitution of Court-Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, reſolves us in theſe words: <hi>By the Laws and Ordinances of ancient Kings, and eſpecially of King</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred, <hi>it appeareth, that the firſt Kings of this Realm had all the Lands of</hi> England <hi>in Demean</hi>; and <hi>les grand Manors and Royalties they reſerved to themſelves,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93433:16"/>
and of the remnant they, for the Defence of the Realm, enfeoffed the Barons of the Realm with ſuch Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as the Court-Baron now hath.</hi> Coke's Inſtitutes, Firſt part, Fol. 58.</p>
                  <p>Here, by the way, I cannot but note, that if the <hi>firſt Kings had all the Lands of</hi> England <hi>in Demean,</hi> as Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> ſaith they had; And if the firſt Kings were choſen by the People (as many think they were) then ſurely our Fore-fathers were a very bountiful (if not a prodigal) People, to give all the Lands of the whole Kingdom to their Kings, with Liberty for them to keep what they pleaſed, and to give the Remainder to their Subjects, clogg'd and encumbred with a Condition to defend the Realm: This is but an ill ſign of a limited Monarchy by origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Conſtitution or Contract. But, to conclude the former point, Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi>'s Opinion is, that <hi>in the ancient Laws, under the name of</hi> Barons, <hi>were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed all the Nobility.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Doctrine of the <hi>Barons</hi> being the <hi>Common Councel</hi> doth diſpleaſe many, and is denied, as tending to the Diſparagement of the Commons, and to the Diſcredit and Confutation of their Opinion, who teach, that the <hi>Commons are aſſigned Councellors to the King by the People</hi>; therefore I will call in Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> to help us with his Teſtimony: He in his Book of <hi>Treachery &amp; Diſloyalty, &amp;c.</hi> proves, that before the Conqueſt, by the Laws of <hi>Edward the Confeſſor,</hi> cap. 17. <hi>The King by his Oaths was to do Juſtice by the Councel of the Nobles of his Realm.</hi> He alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves, that the <hi>Earls and Barons in Parliament are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the King, and ought to bridle him, when he exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates from the Laws.</hi> He further tells us, the <hi>Peers &amp; Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates have oft tranſlated the Crown from the right Heir,</hi>

                  <p>All theſe Teſtimonies from Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> may ſatisfie, that anciently the <hi>Barons</hi> were the <hi>Common Councel, or Parliament of</hi> England. And if Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> could have found ſo much Antiquity, and Proof for the Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes, being of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Councel:</hi> I make no doubt but we ſhould have heard from him in Capital Characters; but alas! he meets not with ſo much as theſe Names in thoſe elder Ages. He dares not ſay, the <hi>Barons</hi> were aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the People, <hi>Councellors</hi> to the <hi>King</hi>; for he tells us, <hi>every Baron in Parliament doth repreſent his own Perſon, and ſpeaketh in behalf of himſelf alone</hi>; but <hi>in the Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes, are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Commons of the whole Realm:</hi> therefore <hi>every one of the Commons hath a greater voice in Parliament than the greateſt Earl in</hi> England. Nevertheleſs Maſter <hi>Pryn</hi> will be very well content if we will admit and ſwallow theſe Parliaments of <hi>Barons,</hi> for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative Body of the Kingdom; and to that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he cites them, or to no Purpoſe at all. But to prove the Treachery and Diſloyalty of Popiſh Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Prelates, and Peers, to their Kings: which is the main Point, that Maſter <hi>Pryn,</hi> by the Title of his Book is to make good, and to prove.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſecond Point; which is, That until the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. the Commons were not called to Parliament: beſides, the general Silence of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which never makes mention of the Commons Coming to Parliament until that time; our Hiſtories
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93433:17"/>
ſay, <hi>before his time only certain of the Nobility were called to Conſultation about the most important affairs of the State: He cauſed the Commons alſo to be aſſembled by Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes of their own Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment:</hi> much to the ſame purpoſe writes Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> ſaying, <hi>it is held that the Kings of</hi> England <hi>had no formal Parliaments till about the</hi> 18<hi>th year of King</hi> Hen. 1. <hi>For in his Third year, for the Marriage of his Daughter, the King raiſed a Tax upon every Hide of Land, by the Advice of his Privy Councel alone.</hi> And the Subjects (ſaith he) <hi>ſoon after this Parliament was eſtabliſhed, began to stand upon Terms with their King, and drew from him by strong hand, and their Swords, their</hi> Great Charter; <hi>it was after the eſtabliſhment of the Parliament, by colour of it, that they had ſo great Daring.</hi> If any deſire to know the cauſe why <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. called the People to Parliament, it was upon no very good Occaſion, if we believe Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi>; The <hi>Grand Charter</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was not originally granted Regally and freely, for King</hi> Hen. 1. <hi>did but uſurp the Kingdom, and therefore the better to ſecure himſelf againſt</hi> Robert <hi>his elder Brother, he flattered the People with thoſe Charters: yea, King</hi> John <hi>that confirmed them, had the like Reſpect: for</hi> Arthur <hi>D. of</hi> Britain <hi>was the undoubted Heir of the Crown, upon whom</hi> John <hi>uſurped: ſo theſe Charters had their original from Kings,</hi> de facto, <hi>but not</hi> de jure: and then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Concluſion is, that <hi>the Great Charter had firſt an obſcure Birth by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation, &amp; was foſtered, and ſhewed to the World by Rebellion:</hi> in brief, the King cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the People to Parliament, and granted them <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> that they might confirm to him the Crown.</p>
                  <p>The third Point conſiſts of two parts; Firſt, that the Commons were not called to Parliament until
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93433:18"/>
                     <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. days, this appears by divers of the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents formerly cited, to prove that the <hi>Barons</hi> were the <hi>Common Councel.</hi> For though <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. called all the People of the Land to his Coronation, and again in the 15. or 18. year of his Reign; yet always he did not ſo; neither many of thoſe Kings that did ſucceed him, as appeareth before.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For calling the Commons by Writ, I find it acknowledged in a Book, intituled, <hi>The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege and Practice of Parliaments,</hi> in theſe words; <hi>In ancient times, after the King had ſummoned His Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, innumerable multitudes of People did make their Acceſs thereunto, pretending that Privilege of Right to belong to them. But King</hi> Hen. 3. <hi>having Experience of the Miſchief, and inconveniences by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſuch popular Confuſion, did take order that none might come to His Parliament but thoſe who were speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſummoned.</hi> To this purpoſe it is obſerved by Maſter <hi>Selden, that the firſt Writs we find accompanied with other Circumstances of a Summons to Parliament, as well for the Commons as Lords, is in the</hi> 49 <hi>of Hen.</hi> 3. In the like manner Maſter <hi>Cambden</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Dignity of <hi>Barons,</hi> hath theſe words: <hi>King</hi> Hen. 3. <hi>out of a great Multitude which were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious and turbulent, called the very beſt by Writ or Summons to Parliament; for he, after many Troubles and Vexations between the King himſelf, and</hi> Simon de Monefort, <hi>with other Barons; and after appeaſed: did decree and ordain, That all thoſe Earls and Barons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom the King himſelf vouchſafed to direct His Writs of Summons ſhould come to his Parliament, and no others: but that which he began a little before his Death,</hi> Edward 1. <hi>and his Succeſſors constantly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and continued. The ſaid prudent King</hi> Edward
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93433:18"/>
                     <hi>ſummoned always thoſe of ancient Families, that were moſt wiſe, to His Parliament; and omitted their Sons after their Death, if they were not anſwerable to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi>

                  <p>I have the longer inſiſted on the Examination of the Writ, being the Power &amp; Actions of the Houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> are principally juſtified by the <hi>Truſt</hi> which the Free-holders commit unto them by virtue of this Writ.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>For fuller Manifeſtation of what hath been ſaid touching the Calling, Election, and Power of the Commons in Parliament, it is behooveful to obſerve ſome Points delivered by Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the Juriſdiction of Parliaments; where,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he fairly begins, and lays his Foundation, that <hi>the High Court of Parliament conſiſteth of the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſitting there, and of the three Eſtates</hi>;
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>The Lords Spiritual.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>The Lords Temporal.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                           <pb n="24" facs="tcp:93433:21"/>3. <hi>And the Commons.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
Hence it is to be gathered, that truly and properly it cannot be called the <hi>High Court of Parliament,</hi> but whilſt the King is ſitting there in Perſon: ſo that the Queſtion now a-days, whether the <hi>Parliament be above the King,</hi> is either falſe or idle: falſe, if you exclude, and idle if you include the King's Perſon in the word <hi>Parliament:</hi> The caſe truly put, and as it is meant, is, whether the three Eſtates, (or, which is all one, the Lords and Commons) aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in Parliament be above the King: and not whether the King with the three Eſtates be above the King: It appears alſo that they are much miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, who reckon the King one of the three Eſtates, as Mr. <hi>Pryn, pag.</hi> 20. and many others do; for the three Eſtates make the Body, and the King is <hi>Caput, Principium, &amp; Finis Parliamentor</hi>', as confeſſeth Sir <hi>Edw. Coke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> delivers, That <hi>certain it is, both Houſes at firſt ſate togther, and that it appears in</hi> Edward <hi>the Third's time, the Lords and Commons ſate together, and the Commons had no continual Speaker.</hi> If he mean, the Lords and Commons did ſit, and Vote together in one Body, few there be that will believe it; becauſe the Commons never were wont to loſe, or forego any of their Liberties, or Privileges; and for them to ſtand now with their Hats in their hands (which is no Magiſtratical Poſture) there, where they were wont to ſit and Vote, is an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not imaginable to be endured by the Commons. It may be, in former times, when the <hi>Commons</hi> had no conſtant Speaker, they were oft, and perhaps for the moſt part, in the ſame Chamber, and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lords, to hear the Debates and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93433:21"/>
of the <hi>Great Councel,</hi> but not to ſit and Vote with them: for when the Commons were to Adviſe among themſelves, the Chapter-houſe of the <hi>Abby</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> was oft-times their place to meet in, before they had a ſetled Houſe, and their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings not being very frequent, may be the reaſon, I conceive, why the name of the Houſe of Commons is not of ſuch great Antiquity, or taken notice of; but the Houſe of Lords was only called the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Houſe: and the Treatiſe called, <hi>Modus tenen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di Parliamentum,</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>Parliament</hi> as but of one Houſe only. The Houſe, where now the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> ſit in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> is but of late Uſe, or Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: for in <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's days it was a Chappel of the Colledge of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi>
                     <note rend="inter">Stow.</note> and had a Dean, Secular Canons, and Choriſts, who were the Kings Quire at his Palace at <hi>Weſtminster,</hi> and at the diſſolution were tranſlated to the Kings Chappel at <hi>White-hall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alſo I read, that <hi>Weſtminſter-hall</hi> being out of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, <hi>Ric.</hi> 2. cauſed a large Houſe to be builded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Clock-tower and the Gate of the great old Hall in the midſt of the Palace Court: the Houſe was long and large, made of Timber, covered with Tiles, open on both ſides, that all might ſee and hear what was both ſaid and done: four thouſand Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> which were the Kings own Guard, attended on that Houſe, and had <hi>bouche a Court,</hi> and 6 <hi>d.</hi> by the day.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he ſaith, <hi>The Commons are to chuſe their Speaker, but ſeeing after their Choice the King may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe him, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe is (as in the</hi> conge d' eſlire <hi>of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop) that the King doth name a Diſcreet, Learned man, whom the Commons Elect: when the Commons have
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93433:22"/>
choſen, the King may allow of his Excuſe, and Diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, as Sir</hi> John Popham <hi>was,</hi> (ſaith his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.)</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he informs us, That <hi>the firſt day of the Parliament four Juſtices aſſiſtants, and two Civilians, (Maſters of the Chancery) are appointed Receivers of Petitions, which are to be delivered within ſix days fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: and ſix of the Nobility, and two Biſhops, calling to them the Kings Learned Councel, when need ſhould be, to be Tryers of the ſaid Petitions, whether they were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, good, and neceſſary to be offered and propounded to the Lords.</hi> He doth not ſay, that any of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were either Receivers, or Tryers of Petitions: nor that the Petitions were to be propounded to Them, but to the Lords.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, he teacheth us, that <hi>a Knight, Citizen, or Burgeſs, cannot make a Proxy, becauſe he is Elected, and Truſted by multitudes of People:</hi> here a Queſtion may be, whether <hi>a Committee,</hi> if it be <hi>Truſted to act any thing,</hi> be not a <hi>Proxy?</hi> ſince he ſaith, <hi>the High Power of Parliament to be committed to a few, is holden to be againſt the Dignity of Parliaments; and that no ſuch Commiſſion ought to be granted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, he ſaith, <hi>The King cannot take notice of any thing ſaid, or done in the Houſe of Commons, but by the Report of the Houſe.</hi> Surely, if the Commons ſate with the Lords, and the <hi>King</hi> were preſent, He might take notice of what was done in His Preſence. And I read in <hi>Vowel,</hi> that <hi>the old <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage was, that all the Degrees of Parliament ſate together, and every man that had there to ſpeak, did it openly, before the King and his whole Parliament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the 35 <hi>Eliz.</hi> there was a Report, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were againſt the Subſidies, which was told
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93433:22"/>
the Queen: whereupon, Sir <hi>Henry Knivet</hi> ſaid, <hi>It ſhould be a thing anſwerable at the Bar for any man to report any thing of Speeches, or Matters done in the Houſe. Sir</hi> John Woolley <hi>liked the Motion of Secrecy; except only the Queen, from whom,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>there is no reaſon to keep any thing:</hi> And <hi>Sir</hi> Robert Cecil <hi>did allow, that the Councel of the Houſe ſhould be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly kept, and nothing reported</hi> in malam partem. <hi>But, if the meaning be, that they might not report any thing done here to the Queen, he was altogether againſt it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, He voucheth <hi>an Inditement or Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Kings Bench againſt</hi> 39 <hi>of the Commons, for departing without Licence from Parliament, contrary to the Kings Inhibition: whereof ſix ſubmitted to their Fines, and</hi> Edmund Ployden <hi>pleaded, he remained continually from the beginning to the end of the Parliament:</hi> Note, he did not plead to the Juriſdiction of the Court of Kings Bench, but pleaded his conſtant Attendance in Parliament, which was an acknowledgment, and ſubmitting to the Juriſdiction of that Court: and had been an unpardonable betraying of the Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Parliament by ſo learned a Lawyer, if his Caſe ought only to be tryed in Parliament.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, he reſolves, that <hi>the Houſe of Lords in their Houſe have Power of Judicature, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in their Houſe: and both Houſes together.</hi> He brings Records to prove the Power of Judicature of both Houſes together, but not of either of them by it ſelf. He cites the 33 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. for the Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of both Houſes together: where <hi>Nicholas de Segrave</hi> was adjudged <hi>per Praelatos, Comites, &amp; Barones, &amp; alios de Concilio,</hi> by the Prelates, Earls and Barons, and others of the Councel. Here is no mention of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93433:23"/>
the Judgment of the Commons. <hi>Others of the Councel,</hi> may mean, the Kings Privy Councel, or his Councel Learned in the Laws, which are called by their Writs to give Counſel; but ſo are not the Commons. The Judgment it ſelf ſaith,
<q>
                        <hi>Nicholas de Segrave</hi> confeſſed his fault in Parliament, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelf to the Kings Will: thereupon the King, willing to have the Advice of the Earls, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, Great men, and others of his Councel, enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them by the Homage, Fealty, and Allegiance which they owed, that they ſhould faithfully coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel Him what Puniſhment ſhould be inflicted for ſuch a Fact: who all, adviſing diligently, <hi>ſay,</hi> That ſuch a Fact deſerves loſs of Life and Members.</q>
Thus the Lords (we ſee) did but Adviſe the King what Judgment to give againſt him that deſerted the <hi>Kings</hi> Camp, to fight a Duel in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ninthly, he ſaith, <hi>Of later times, ſee divers notable Judgments at the Proſecution of the Commons, by the Lords:</hi> where the Commons were Proſecutors, they were no Judges, but (as he terms them) <hi>general In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors,</hi> or the <hi>Grand Inqueſt of the Kingdom.</hi> The Judgments he cites are but in King <hi>James</hi> his days, and no elder.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, alſo he tells us, of the <hi>Judicature in the Houſe of Commons alone</hi>; his moſt ancient precedent is but in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign, of one <hi>Tho. Long, who gave the Mayor of</hi> Weſtbury 10 l. <hi>to be elected Burgeſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, he hath a Section, entitled, <hi>The Houſe of Commons (to many Purpoſes) a diſtinct Court:</hi> and ſaith, <hi>Not a, the Houſe of Commons to many Purpoſes, a diſtinct Court:</hi> of thoſe many Purpoſes he tells but one, that is, <hi>it uſes to adjourn it ſelf.</hi> Commiſſioners that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93433:23"/>
be but to examine Witneſſes, may Adjourn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet are no Court.</p>

                        <hi>CHARLES by the Grace of God, &amp;c.</hi> To the moſt Reverend Father in Chriſt <hi>W.</hi> by the ſame Grace Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Primate and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan of all <hi>England,</hi> Health. Whereas by the Advice and Aſſent of our Councel, for certain diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and urgent Buſineſſes concerning Us, the State, and Defence of Our Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and of the Engliſh Church: We have Ordained a certain Parliament of Ours to be holden at <hi>W. &amp;c.</hi> and there to have Conference, and to treat with you the Prelates, Great men, and Peers of Our ſaid Kingdom. We ſtraitly Charge and Command, by the Faith and Love by which you are bound to Us, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Difficulties of the Buſineſſes aforeſaid, and the imminent Dangers, and ſetting aſide all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93433:24"/>
you be perſonally preſent at the Day and Place aforeſaid, to treat and give your Counſel concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſaid Buſineſſes: And this, as you love Us and Our Honour, and the Safe-guard of the foreſaid Kingdom and Church, and the Expedition of the ſaid Buſineſſes, you muſt no way omit. Forewarn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Dean and Chapter of your Church of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> and the Arch-deacons, and all the Clergy of your Dioceſe, that the ſame Dean, and the Arch-deacon in their proper Perſons, and the ſaid Chapter by one, and the ſaid Clergy by two fit Proctors, having full and ſufficient Power from them the Chapter and Clergy, be perſonally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the foreſaid Day and Place, to Conſent to thoſe things, which then and there ſhall happen by the favour of God, to be Ordained by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Councel of our Kingdom. Witneſs our Self at <hi>Weſtm'.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſame Form of Writ, <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding with, <hi>you must no way omit.</hi> Witneſs, &amp;c. is to the Temporal Barons: But whereas the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Barons are required by the Faith and Love; the Temporal are required by their Allegiance or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</p>
                     <p>The Difference between the two Writs is, <hi>that</hi> the <hi>Lords</hi> are to <hi>Treat</hi> and to <hi>Give Counſel</hi>; the <hi>Commons</hi> are to <hi>Perform</hi> and <hi>Conſent</hi> to what is ordained.</p>
                     <p>By this Writ the Lords have a <hi>deliberative</hi> or a <hi>conſultive Power to Treat, and give Counſel in difficult Buſineſſes:</hi> and ſo likewiſe have the Judges, Barons of the Exchequer, the Kings Councel, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Chancery, by their Writs. But over and beſides this Power, the Lords do exerciſe a <hi>deciſive</hi>
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:93433:25"/>
or <hi>Judicial</hi> Power, which is not mentioned or found in their Writ.</p>
                     <p>For the better Underſtanding of theſe two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Powers, we muſt carefully note the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between a <hi>Judge</hi> and a <hi>Counſellor</hi> in a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy: the ordinary Duty, or Office of a <hi>Judge</hi> is to give Judgment, and to command in the Place of the King; but the ordinary Duty of a <hi>Counſellor</hi> is to adviſe the King what he himſelf ſhall do, or cauſe to be done: The <hi>Judge</hi> repreſents the <hi>Kings Perſon in his abſence,</hi> the <hi>Counſellor</hi> in the <hi>Kings Preſence</hi> gives his Advice: <hi>Judges</hi> by their Commiſſion or Inſtitution are limited their Charge and Power, and in ſuch things they may judge, and cauſe their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be put in execution: But <hi>Counſellors</hi> have no Power to command their Conſultations to be executed, for that were to take away the Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from their Prince, who by his Wiſdom is to weigh the Advice of his Councel, and at liberty to reſolve according to the Judgment of the wiſer part of his Councel, and not always of the greater: In a word, regularly a <hi>Councellor</hi> hath no Power but in the Kings Preſence, and a <hi>Judge</hi> no Power but out of his Preſence; Theſe two Powers thus diſtinguiſhed, have yet ſuch Correſpondency, and there is ſo near Affinity between the Acts of judging and counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; that although the ordinary Power of the Judg is to give Judgment: yet by their Oath they are bound in Cauſes extraordinary, when the King pleaſeth to call them, to be his Counſellors; and on the other ſide, although the proper work of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor be only to make Report of his Advice to his Sovereign, yet many times for the Eaſe only, and by the Permiſſion of the King, Councellors are allowed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93433:25"/>
to judge and command in Points wherein ordinarily they know the mind of the Prince; and what they do is the act of the Royal Power it ſelf: for the Councel is always preſuppoſed to be united to the Perſon of the King, and therefore the Decrees of the Councel are ſtyled, <hi>By the King in his Privy Councel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To apply this Diſtinction to the Houſe of <hi>Peers:</hi> whe find originally they are called as Counſellors to the King, and ſo have only a <hi>deliberative</hi> Power ſpecified in their Writ, and therefore the Lords do only then properly perform the Duty for which they are called, when they are in the King's Preſence, that <hi>He may have Conference and treat with them:</hi> the very Words of the Writ are, <hi>Nobiſcum ac cum Praelatis, Magnatibus &amp; Proceribus praedictis ſuper dictis negotiis tractaturi vestrumque concilium impenſuri,</hi> with Us and with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, Great men and Peers, to treat and give your councel: the word <hi>Nobiſcum</hi> implieth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the King's Preſence. It is a thing in reaſon moſt abſurd, to make the King aſſent to the Judgments in Parliament, and allow Him no part in the Conſultation; this were to make the King a Subject. Councel loſeth the name of <hi>Counſel,</hi> and becomes a Command, if it put a Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon the King to follow it: ſuch Imperious Councels, make thoſe that are but Counſellors in name to be Kings in Fact: and Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be but Subjects. We read in Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Cotton,</hi> that <hi>towards the end of the Saxons, and the firſt times of the Norman Kings, Parliaments ſtood in Custom-grace fixed to Easter, Whitſuntide, and Chriſtmas; and that at the Kings Court, or Palace,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93433:26"/>
Parliaments ſate in the Preſence, or Privy Chamber:</hi> from whence he infers <hi>an Improbability to believe the King excluded His own Preſence; and unmannerly for Gueſts to bar him their Company who gave them their Entertainment.</hi> And although now a-days the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament ſit not in the Court where the Kings houſhold remains, yet ſtill even to this day, to ſhew that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments are the Kings Gueſts, the Lord Steward of the Kings Houſhold keeps a ſtanding Table to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>Peers</hi> during the ſitting of Parliament; and he alone, or ſome from, or under him, as the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, or Comptroller of the Kings Houſhold takes the Oaths of the Members of the Houſe of Commons the firſt day of the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note rend="inter">Selden.</note>Sir <hi>Richard Scroop</hi> Steward of the Houſhold of our Sovereign Lord the King, by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Lords ſitting in full Parliament in the Great Chamber, put <hi>J. Lord Gomeniz</hi> and <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Weston</hi> to anſwer ſeverally to Accuſations brought againſt them.</p>
                     <p>The Neceſſity of the King's Preſence in Parliament, appears by the Deſire of Parliaments themſelves in former times; and the Practice of it Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> proves by ſeveral Precedents: whence he concludes, <hi>that in the Conſultations of State, and Deciſions of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Plaints, it is clear from all times, the King was not only preſent to adviſe, but to determine alſo.</hi> When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the King is preſent, all Power of judging, which is derived from <hi>His,</hi> ceaſeth: The Votes of the Lords may ſerve for matter of Advice, the final Judgment is only the Kings. Indeed, of late years, Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> by reaſon of their Sex, being not ſo fit for publick Aſſemblies, have brought them out of Uſe, by which means it is come
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93433:26"/>
to paſs, that many things which were in former times acted by Kings themſelves, have of late been left to the Judgment of the <hi>Peers</hi>; who, in Quality of Judges extraordinary, are permitted for the Eaſe of the King, and in his abſence, to determine ſuch matters as are properly brought before the King Himſelf ſitting in Perſon, attended with <hi>His great Councel of Prelates and Peers.</hi> And the Ordinances that are made there, receive their Eſtabliſhment ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Kings Preſence in Parliament, where his Chair of State is commonly placed; or at leaſt from the Confirmation of Him, who in all Courts, and in all Cauſes is Supreme Judge. All Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is by, or under Him; it cannot be without, much leſs againſt his Approbation. <hi>The King only and none but He, if he were able, ſhould judge all Cauſes</hi>; ſaith <hi>Bracton,</hi> that ancient Chief Juſtice in <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. time.</p>
                     <p>An ancient Precedent I meet with cited by Maſter <hi>Selden,</hi> of a judicious Proceeding in a Criminal Cauſe of the <hi>Barons</hi> before the Conqueſt, wherein I obſerve the <hi>Kings Will</hi> was, that the Lords ſhould be Judges, in the Cauſe wherein <hi>Himſelf</hi> was a Party; and <hi>He</hi> ratified their Proceeding: The caſe was thus, Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> having had a Trial before the Lords under King <hi>Hardicanute,</hi> touching the Death of <hi>Alfred</hi> (Son to King <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> and Brother to him who was afterward <hi>Edward the Confeſſor</hi>) had fled out of <hi>England</hi>; and upon his Return, with hope of <hi>Edward the Confeſſor</hi>'s Favour, he ſolicited the Lords to intercede for him with the King; who (conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together) brought <hi>Godwin</hi> with them before the King to obtain his Grace and Favour: But the King preſently, as ſoon as he beheld him, ſaid, <hi>Thou
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93433:27"/>
Traytor</hi> Godwin, <hi>I do appeal thee of the Death of my Brother</hi> Alfred <hi>whom thou haſt moſt Trayterouſly ſlain</hi>; Then <hi>Godwin</hi> excuſing it, anſwered, <hi>My Lord the King, may it pleaſe your Grace, I neither betrayed nor killed your Brother, whereof I put my ſelf upon the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your Court:</hi> Then the King ſaid, <hi>You noble Lords, Earls, and Barons of the Land, who are my Liege men now gathered here together, and have heard my Appeal, and</hi> Godwin's <hi>Anſwer,</hi> I will <hi>that in this Appeal between us, ye decree right Judgment, and do true Juſtice.</hi> The Earls and Barons treating of this among themſelves were of differing Judgments; ſome ſaid, that <hi>Godwin</hi> was never bound to the King, either by Homage, Service, or Fealty, and therefore could not be his Traytor, and that he had not ſlain <hi>Alfred</hi> with his own hands: others ſaid, that neither Earl nor Baron, nor any other Subject of the King, could wage his war by Law againſt the King in his Appeal; but muſt wholly put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the King's Mercy, and offer competent Amends. Then <hi>Leofric Conſul of Cheſter,</hi> a good man before God and the World, ſaid, Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> next to the King, is a man of the beſt Parentage of all <hi>England,</hi> and he cannot deny, but that by his Counſel <hi>Alfred</hi> the King's Brother was ſlain, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for my part I conſider, that <hi>He and his Son, and all we twelve Earls who are his Friends and Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, do go humbly before the King, laden with ſo much Gold and Silver as each of us can carry in our Arms, offering him That for his Offence, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly praying for Pardon; And he will pardon the Earl, and taking his Homage and Fealty, will reſtore him all his Lands.</hi> All they in this form lading them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Treaſure, and coming to the King, did

                     <p>In the caſe of the Lord <hi>de la Ware,</hi> the Judgment of the Lords was, <hi>that he ſhould have place next after the Lord</hi> Willoughby <hi>of</hi> Erisby, by conſent of all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Lord <hi>Windſor:</hi> and the <hi>Lord Keeper was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to acquaint her Majeſty with the Determination of the Peers, and to know her Pleaſure concerning the ſame.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Inference from theſe Precedents, is, that the <hi>Deciſive</hi> or <hi>Judicial</hi> Power exerciſed in the <hi>Chamber of Peers,</hi> is meerly derivative, and ſubſervient to the Supreme Power, which reſides in the King, and is grounded ſolely upon his <hi>grace</hi> and favour; for howſoever the Houſe of Commons do alledge their Power to be founded on the Principles of Nature, in that they are the Repreſentative Body of the Kingdom (as they ſay) and ſo being the whole, may take care, and have power by Nature to preſerve themſelves: yet the Houſe of Peers do not, nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93433:28"/>
make any ſuch the leaſt Pretence, ſince there is no reaſon in Nature, why amongſt a company of men who are all equal, ſome few ſhould be picked out to be exalted above their Fellows, and have power to Govern thoſe who by Nature are their Companions. The difference between a <hi>Peer</hi> and a <hi>Commoner,</hi> is not by <hi>Nature,</hi> but by the <hi>grace of the Prince:</hi> who creates Honours, and makes thoſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours to be hereditary (whereas he might have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them for life only, or during pleaſure, or good behaviour) and alſo annexeth to thoſe Honours the power of having Votes in Parliament, as heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Counſellors, furniſhed with ampler privileges than the Commons: All theſe Graces conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Peers, are ſo far from being derived from the Law of Nature, that they are contradictory and deſtructive of that natural Equality and Freedom of Mankind, which many conceive to be the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the privileges and Liberties of the Houſe of Commons; There is ſo ſtrong an oppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Liberties of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> that it had never been poſſible for the two Houſes of Parliament to have ſtood together without mortal Enmity, and eternal Jarring, had they been raiſed upon ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Foundations: But the Truth is, the Liberties and Privileges of both Houſes have but one, and the ſelf-ſame Foundation, which is nothing elſe but the meer and ſole Grace of Kings.</p>
                     <p>Thus much may ſerve to ſhew the Nature and Original of the <hi>deliberative</hi> and <hi>deciſive</hi> Power of the Peers of the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>The matter about which the <hi>deliberative</hi> power is converſant, is generally the Conſulting and Advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93433:29"/>
upon any urgent Buſineſs which concerns the King, or Defence of the Kingdom: and more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſometimes in preparing new Laws; and this Power is grounded upon the Writ.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>deciſive</hi> Power is exerciſed in giving Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſome difficult Caſes; but for this Power of the <hi>Peers,</hi> I find no Warrant in their Writ.</p>
                     <p>Whereas the Parliament is ſtyled the <hi>Supreme Court,</hi> it muſt be underſtood properly of the King ſitting in the Houſe of Peers in Perſon; and but impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly of the Lords without him: Every Supreme Court muſt have the Supreme Power, and the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power is always Arbitrary; for that is Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary which hath no Superiour on Earth to controll it. The laſt Appeal in all Government, muſt ſtill be to an Arbitrary Power, or elſe Appeals will be <hi>in Infinitum,</hi> never at an end. The <hi>Legiſlative Power</hi> is an <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> for they are <hi>termini converti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The main Queſtion in theſe our days, is, <hi>Where this Power Legiſlative remains?</hi> or is placed; upon conference of the Writs of Summons for both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, with the Bodies and Titles of our Ancient Acts of <hi>Parliament,</hi> we ſhall find the Power of making Laws reſts ſolely in the King. Some affirm, that a part of the <hi>Legiſlative Power</hi> is in either of the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; but beſides invincible reaſon from the Nature of Monarchy it ſelf, which muſt have the Supreme Power Alone; the conſtant Antient Declaration of this Kingdom is againſt it. For howſoever of later years in the Titles and Bodies of our Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it be not ſo particularly expreſſed who is the Author and Maker of our Laws, yet in almoſt all our elder Statutes it is preciſely expreſſed, that they

are made by the <hi>King Himſelf:</hi> The general words uſed of later times, that <hi>Laws are made by Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Parliament,</hi> are particularly explained in former Statutes, to mean, <hi>That the King Ordains, the Lords Adviſe, the Commons Conſent,</hi> as by comparing the Writs with the Statutes that expound the Writs, will evidently appear.</p>

                     <p>In the ſelf-ſame ſtyle runs <hi>Charta de Foreſta,</hi> and tells us the Author of it.</p>
                     <p>The Statute <hi>de Scaccario</hi> 41 <hi>H.</hi> 3. begins in theſe words, <hi>The</hi> King Commandeth, that all <hi>Bailiffs, She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs, and other Officers, &amp;c.</hi> And concerning the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Chester,</hi> the King Willeth, <hi>&amp;c. and again,</hi> He Commandeth <hi>the Treaſurer and Barons of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer upon their Allegiance.</hi>

                     <p>In his 10. year it is ſaid, <hi>Becauſe</hi> Our Lord King Edw. 3. <hi>hath received by the Complaint of the Prelates, Earls, Barons; alſo at the ſhewing of the Knights of the Shires, and his Commons by their Petition put in his Parliament, &amp;c.</hi> Hath ordained, <hi>by the Aſſent, &amp;c. at the Requeſt of the ſaid Knights and Commons, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>As for the Parliaments in <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. <hi>and Rich.</hi> 3. Reigns, the moſt of them do agree in this one Title, Our Lord the King, <hi>by the Advice and Aſſent of his Lords, and at the ſpecial In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and Requeſt of the Commons,</hi> hath ordained. The Precedents in this Point are ſo numerous, that it were endleſs to cite them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Statutes</hi> in <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. days do for the moſt part agree, both in the Titles and Bodies of the Acts, in theſe words: Our Lord the King <hi>by the Aſſent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in Parliament Aſſembled, and by the Authority of the ſame</hi> hath ordained.</p>
                     <p>Unto this King's time we find the <hi>Commons very often petitioning, but not petitioned unto.</hi> The firſt Petition made to the Commons that I meet with among the Statutes, is but in the middle of this King <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. Reign, which was ſo well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, that the Petition it ſelf is turned into a Statute: It begins thus, <hi>To the</hi> Right Worſhipful Commons <hi>in this preſent Parliament Aſſembled:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93433:31"/>
Sheweth to your Diſcreet Wiſdoms, the Wardens of the Fellowſhip of the Craft of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pholsters within London,</hi> &amp;c. This Petition, though it be directed to the Commons in the Title; yet the Prayer of the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is turned to the King, and not to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; for it Concludes, <hi>Therefore it may pleaſe the Kings Highneſs, by the Advice of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and his Commons in Parliament,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Next for the Statutes of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. they do moſt part agree both in their Titles, and the Bodies of the Acts, with thoſe of his Father King <hi>Hen.</hi> 7.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, in the Statutes of <hi>Edw.</hi> the 6. Qu. <hi>Mary,</hi> Qu. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> K. <hi>James,</hi> and of our Sovereign Lord the King that now is, there is no mention made in their Titles of any Aſſent of Lords and Commons, or of any Ordaining by the King, but only in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Terms it is ſaid, <hi>Acts made in Parliament:</hi> or thus, <hi>At the Parliament were Enacted:</hi> yet in the Bodies of many of theſe Acts of theſe laſt Princes, there is ſometimes Mention made of <hi>Conſent of Lords and Commons,</hi> in theſe or the like words: <hi>It is Enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the King, with the Aſſent of the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>; Except only in the Statutes of our Lord King <hi>Charles,</hi> wherein there is no mention, that I can find, of any Conſent of the Lords and Commons; or Ordaining by the King: But the words are, <hi>Be it Enacted by Authority of Parliament:</hi> or elſe, <hi>Be it Enacted by the King, the Lords Spiritual and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and Commons</hi>; as if they were all Fellow-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners.</p>
                     <p>Thus it appears, that even till the time of K. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. who lived but in our Fathers days, it was punctually expreſſed in every Kings Laws, that the Statutes and Ordinances were made by the King. And withal we
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93433:32"/>
may ſee by what degrees the Styles, and Titles of Acts of Parliament have been varied, and to whoſe diſadvantage. The higher we look, the more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute we find the Power of Kings in Ordaining; nor do we meet with at firſt ſo much as the Aſſent or Advice of the Lords mentioned. Nay, if we caſt our eye upon many Statutes of thoſe that be of moſt Antiquity, they will appear as if they were no Laws at all; but as if they had been made only to teach us, that the puniſhments of many Officers were left to the meer pleaſure of Kings. The <hi>puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> part of the Law, which gives all the Vigour and Binding Part to the Law, we find committed by the Statutes to the Kings meer Will and Pleaſure, as if there were no Law at all. I will offer a few Precedents to the Point.</p>
                     <p>3 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 9. ſaith, <hi>That Sheriffs, Coroners, and Bayliffs, for concealing of Felonies ſhall make grievous</hi> Fines at the Kings Pleaſure.</p>

                     <p>For further proof that the Legiſlative Power is proper to the King, we may take notice, that in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient time, as Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> ſaith, <hi>All Acts of Parliament were in form of Petitions:</hi> if the Petitions were from the Commons, and the Anſwer of them the King's, it is eaſie thereby to judge who made the Act of Parliament: Alſo Sir <hi>Jo.

                     <p>In the old Statutes it is hard to diſtinguiſh what Laws were made by Kings <hi>in</hi> Parliament, and what <hi>out</hi> of Parliament: when Kings called <hi>Peers</hi> only to Parliament, and of thoſe how many, or whom they pleaſed, (as it appears anciently they did) it was no eaſie matter to put a difference between a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel-Table and a Parliament: or between a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and a Statute: Yet it is moſt evident, that in old times there was a diſtinction between the <hi>Kings eſpecial</hi> or <hi>Privy Councel,</hi> and his <hi>Common Councel</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom:</hi> and His ſpecial Councel did ſit with the Peers in Parliament, and were of great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Authority there.</p>

                        <pb n="55" facs="tcp:93433:36"/>In the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. an <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>Proviſion</hi> was made by the <hi>Kings Councel,</hi> and it was pleaded at the Common Law in Bar to a Writ of Dower; the Plaintiffs Attorney could not deny it, and thereupon the Judgment was, <hi>ideo ſine die.</hi> It ſeems in thoſe days an Order of the Kings Councel, was either parcel of the Common Law, or above it.</p>
                     <p>Alſo we may find, the Judges have had Regard, that before they would reſolve or give Judgment in new Caſes, they conſulted with the King's Privy Councel.</p>
                     <p>In the caſe of <hi>Adam Brabſon</hi> who was aſſaulted by <hi>R. W.</hi> in the Preſence of the Juſtices of Aſſiſe at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the Judges would have the <hi>Advice of the Kings Councel:</hi> for in a like Caſe, becauſe <hi>R.

                        <hi>Green</hi> and <hi>Thorp</hi> were ſent by the Judges to the <hi>Kings Councel,</hi> to demand of them whether by the <hi>Stat.</hi> of 14 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.16. a word may be amended in a Writ; and it was anſwered that a word may be well amended, although the <hi>Stat.</hi> ſpeaks but of a Letter or Syllable.</p>
                     <p>In the Caſe of Sir <hi>Thomas Ogthred,</hi> who brought a <hi>Formedon</hi> againſt a poor man and his Wife; they came and yielded to the Demandant, which ſeemed ſuſpitious to the Court; whereupon Judgment was ſtaid, and <hi>Thorp</hi> ſaid that in the like Caſe of <hi>Giles Blacket</hi> it was ſpoken of in Parliament, and we were commanded that when any like ſhould come we ſhould not go to Judgment without good Advice; therefore the Judges Concluſion was, <hi>Sues au coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell

                     <p>Thus we ſee the Judges themſelves were guided by the <hi>Kings Councel,</hi> and yet the Opinions of Judges have guided the Lords in Parliament in Point of Law.</p>
                     <p>All the Judges of the Realm, Barons of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, of the Quoif; the Kings learned Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, and the Civilians, Maſters of Chancery, are called Temporal Aſſiſtants by Sir <hi>Edw. Coke,</hi> and though he deny them Voices in Parliament, yet he confeſſeth, that by their Writ they have power both to <hi>treat, and to give Counſel.</hi> I cannot find that the Lords have any other Power by their Writ: the Words of the Lords Writ are, <hi>That you be preſent with us the Prelates, Great men, and Peers, to treat and give your Counſel:</hi> The Words of the Judges Writ are, <hi>That you be preſent with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, and others of the Councel</hi> (and ſometimes with <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> only) <hi>to treat and give your Counſel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Judges uſually joined in Committees with the Lords in all Parliaments, even in Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> Reign, until her 39th. Year; and then upon the 7th. of <hi>November,</hi> the Judges were appointed to <hi>attend</hi> the Lords. And whereas the Judges have liberty in the upper Houſe it ſelf, upon leave given them by the L. Keeper, to cover themſelves, now at Committees they ſit always uncovered.</p>
                     <p>The Power of Judges in Parliament is beſt underſtood, if we conſider how the judicial Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Peers hath been exerciſed in matter of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature: we may find it hath been the Practice,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93433:37"/>
that though the Lords in the Kings Abſence give Judgment in Point of Law, yet they are to be directed and regulated by the Kings Judges, who are beſt able to give Direction in the difficult Points of the Law; which ordinarily are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Lords. And therefore, if any Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour be committed in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> which is the higheſt ordinary Court of Common Law in the Kingdom, that Errour muſt be redreſſed in Parliament. And the manner is, ſaith the Lord Chancellor <hi>Egerton, If a Writ of Errour be ſued in Parl. upon a Judgment given by the Judges in the Kings Bench, the Lords of the higher Houſe alone, (without the Commons) are to examine the Errours. The Lords are to proceed according to the Law, and for their Judgments therein they are to be informed by the Advice and Councel of the Judges, who are to inform them what the Law is, and to direct them in their Judgment; for the Lords are not to follow their own Diſcretion or Opinion otherwiſe.</hi>

                     <p>28 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. the Commons made Sute <hi>that W. de la Pool D. of Suffolk, ſhould be committed to Priſon for many Treaſons, and other Crimes; the Lords of the higher Houſe were doubtful what Anſwer to give; the Opinion of the Judges was demanded, their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was, that he ought not to be committed, for that the Commons did not charge him with any particular Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but with general Reports and Slanders:</hi> this Opinion was allowed.</p>
                     <p>31 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. A Parliament being prorogued, in the Vacation the <hi>Speaker of the Houſe of Commons</hi> was condemned in a thouſand Pounds Damages in an Action of Treſpaſs, and committed to Priſon in Execution for the ſame: when the Parliament
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93433:38"/>
was re-aſſembled, the Commons made Sute to the King and Lords, to have their Speaker delivered. The Lords demanded the Opinion of the Judges, whether he might be delivered out of Priſon by Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of Parliament; upon the Judges Anſwer it was concluded, that <hi>the Speaker ſhould remain in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon according to the Law, notwithſtanding the Privilege of Parliament, and that he was Speaker</hi>; which Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was declared to the Commons by <hi>Moyle</hi> the Kings Serjeant at Law, and the Commons were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Kings name by the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> (in the abſence of the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> then Chancellor) to chuſe another Speaker.</p>
                     <p>7 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. A Queſtion was moved in Parliament, <hi>Whether Spiritual Perſons might be convented before Temporal Judges for Criminal Cauſes?</hi> there Sir <hi>John Fineux,</hi> and the other Judges delivered their Opinion, <hi>that they might and ought to be; and their Opinion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and maintained by the King and Lords, and Dr.</hi> Standiſh, <hi>who before had holden the ſame Opinion, was delivered from the Biſhops.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I find it affirmed, <hi>that in Cauſes which receive De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination in the Houſe of Lords, the King hath no Vote at all, no more than in other Courts of miniſterial Juriſdiction.</hi> True it is, the King hath no Vote at all, if we underſtand by <hi>Vote</hi> a <hi>Voice among others:</hi> for he hath no partners with him in giving Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But if by <hi>no Vote</hi> is meant <hi>He</hi> hath no Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to judge; we deſpoil him of his Sovereignty: It is the chief Mark of Supremacy to judge in the higheſt Cauſes, and laſt Appeals. This the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> full well underſtood, when they peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned for a <hi>King to judge them</hi>; if the <hi>dernier reſort</hi> be to the Lords alone, then they have the Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93433:38"/>
But as <hi>Moſes</hi> by chuſing Elders to judge in ſmall Cauſes, did not thereby loſe his Authority to be Judge himſelf when he pleaſed, even in the ſmalleſt Matters; much leſs in the greateſt, which he reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to himſelf: ſo Kings by delegating others to judg under them, do not hereby denude themſelves of a Power to judge when they think good.</p>
                     <p>There is a Diſtinction of theſe times, that <hi>Kings themſelves may not judge, but they may ſee and look to the Judges, that they give Judgment according to Law</hi>; and for this Purpoſe only (as ſome ſay) Kings may ſometimes ſit in the Courts of Juſtice. But it is not poſſible for Kings to ſee the Laws exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, except there be a Power in Kings both to judge when the Laws are duly executed, and when not; as alſo to compel the Judges if they do not their Duty. Without ſuch Power a King ſitting in Courts is but a Mockery, and a Scorn to the Judges. And if this Power be allowed to Kings, then their Judgments are ſupream in all Courts. And indeed our <hi>Common Law to this purpoſe doth preſume that the King hath all Laws within the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of His Breast, in Scrinio pectoris,</hi> ſaith <hi>Campton's</hi> Juriſdiction. 108.</p>
                     <p>When ſeveral of our Statutes leave many things to the <hi>Pleaſure of the King,</hi> for us to interpret all thoſe Statutes of the <hi>Will and Pleaſure of the Kings Juſtices, only,</hi> is to give an abſolute Arbitrary Power to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices in thoſe Caſes wherein we deny it to the King.</p>
                     <p>The Statute of 5 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 2. makes a Difference between the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>Kings Juſtices,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Divers notorious Felons be indicted of divers Felonies, Murders, Rapes: and as well before the Kings Juſtices, as before the King himſelf, arraigned of the ſame Felonies.</hi>

                     <p>Notwithſtanding all that hath been ſaid for the Legiſlative and Judicial Power of Kings, Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> is ſo far from yielding the King a Power to make Laws, that he will not grant the King a Power to hinder a Law from being made; that is, he allows Him not a <hi>Negative Voice</hi> in moſt Caſes, which is due to every other, even to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Member of the Houſe of Commons in his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>To prove the King hath not a <hi>Negative Voice,</hi> his main, and in Truth, his only Argument inſiſted on, is a <hi>Coronation-Oath,</hi> which is ſaid anciently ſome of our Kings of <hi>England</hi> have taken, wherein <hi>they grant to defend and protect the juſt Laws and Cuſtoms, which the Vulgar hath, or ſhall chuſe: Justas Leges &amp; Conſuetudines quas Vulgus elegerit:</hi> hence Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> concludes, that the King cannot deny any Law which the Lords and Commons ſhall make Choice of; for ſo he will have <hi>vulgus</hi> to ſignifie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="61" facs="tcp:93433:39"/>Though neither our <hi>King,</hi> nor many of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors ever took this Oath, nor were bound to take it, for ought appears; yet we may admit that our King hath taken it; and anſwer, we may be confident, that neither the Biſhops, nor Privy Councel, nor Parliament, nor any other, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were, that framed or penn'd this Oath, ever intended in this word <hi>Vulgus,</hi> the <hi>Commons</hi> in Parliament, much leſs the <hi>Lords:</hi> they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much diſparage the Members of Parliament, as to diſgrace them with a Title both baſe and falſe: it had been enough, if not too much, to have called them <hi>Populus,</hi> the <hi>People</hi>; but <hi>Vulgus</hi> the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> the <hi>rude multitude</hi> (which hath the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet of <hi>Ignobile Vulgus</hi>) is a word as diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Compoſers of the Oath to give, or for the King to uſe, as for the Members of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to receive; it being moſt falſe: for the <hi>Peers</hi> cannot be <hi>Vulgus,</hi> becauſe they are the prime Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Kingdom: next, the Knights of the Shires are, or ought to be <hi>notable</hi> Knights, or <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi> Eſquires, <hi>or</hi> Gentlemen <hi>born in the Counties, as ſhall be able to be</hi> Knights: <hi>then the</hi> Citizens <hi>and</hi> Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes <hi>are to be most ſufficient,</hi> none of theſe can be <hi>Vulgus:</hi> even thoſe Free-holders that chuſe Knights, are the beſt and ableſt men of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; there being for every Free-holder, above ten of the Common People to be found to be termed the Vulgar: Therefore it reſts that <hi>Vulgus</hi> muſt ſignifie the <hi>vulgar</hi> or <hi>common People,</hi> and not the <hi>Lords and Commons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now the Doubt will be, what the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People, or <hi>Vulgus,</hi> out of Parliament, have to do to chuſe Laws? The Anſwer is eaſie and ready;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93433:40"/>
there goeth before <hi>quas vulgus,</hi> the Antecedent <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuetudines,</hi> that is, <hi>the Cuſtoms which the Vulgar hath, or ſhall chuſe.</hi> Do but obſerve the Nature of <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> and it is the <hi>Vulgus</hi> or <hi>Common People only who chuſe Cuſtoms:</hi> Common Uſage time out of mind creates a Cuſtom; and the commoner an Uſage is, the ſtronger and the better is the Cuſtom: no where can ſo common an Uſage be found, as among the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> who are ſtill the far greateſt part of every Multitude: if a Cuſtom be common through the whole Kingdom, it is all one with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law in <hi>England,</hi> which is ſaid to be <hi>Common Cuſtom.</hi> Thus in plain terms, to protect the <hi>Customs which the Vulgar chuſe, is to ſwear to protect the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Laws of</hi> England.</p>
                     <p>But grant that <hi>Vulgus</hi> in the Oath, ſignifies <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> and that <hi>Conſuetudines</hi> doth not ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie Cuſtoms, but Statutes, (as Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Shift affirms) and let <hi>elegerit</hi> be the Future, or Preterperfect Tenſe, even which Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> pleaſe, yet it cannot exclude the <hi>Kings Negative Voice</hi>; for as <hi>Conſuetudines</hi> goeth before <hi>quas vulgus,</hi> ſo doth <hi>juſtas</hi> ſtand before <hi>leges &amp; conſuetudines:</hi> ſo that not all Laws, but only all juſt Laws are meant. If the ſole Choice of the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> did oblige the King to protect their Choice, without Power of Denial, what Need, or why is the Word <hi>juſtas</hi> put in, to raiſe a Scruple that ſome Laws may be unjuſt? Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> will not ſay that a Decree of a General Councel, or of a Pope is infallible, nor (I think) a Bill of the Lords and Commons is infallible, juſt, and impoſſible to erre; if he do, Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> will tell him, that <hi>Parliaments have been utterly deceived, and that in caſes of greateſt Moment, even in
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93433:40"/>
caſe of High Treaſon:</hi> and he calls the Statute of 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. <hi>an unjuſt and ſtrange Act.</hi> But it may be Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> will confeſs, that Laws choſen by the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> may be unjuſt, ſo that the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> themſelves may be the Judges of what is juſt or unjuſt. But where the King by Oath binds his Conſcience to <hi>protect juſt Laws,</hi> it concerns him to be ſatisfied in his own Conſcience, that they be juſt, and not by an implicit Faith, or blind Obedience: no man can be ſo proper a Judge of the Juſtneſs of Laws, as he whoſe Soul muſt lye at the Stake for the Defence and Safeguard of them.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, in this very Oath the King doth ſwear, to do <hi>equal and right Juſtice and Diſcretion, in Mercy and Truth in all His Judgments: facies fieri in omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus judiciis tuis aequam &amp; rectam juſtitiam &amp; diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem in Miſericordia &amp; Veritate:</hi> if we allow the King <hi>Diſcretion</hi> and <hi>Mercy in his Judgments,</hi> of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity he muſt judge of the Juſtneſs of the Laws.</p>
                     <p>Again, the clauſe of the Oath, <hi>quas vulgus ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerit,</hi> doth not mention the Aſſenting unto, or <hi>grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any new Laws,</hi> but of <hi>holding, protecting, and ſtrengthening with all his Might, the juſt Laws that were already in Being:</hi> there were no need of Might or Strength, if aſſenting to new Laws were there meant.</p>
                     <p>Some may wonder, why there ſhould be ſuch Labouring <hi>to deny the King a negative Voice,</hi> ſince a negative Voice is in it ſelf ſo poor a thing, that if a man had all the Negative Voices in the Kingdom, it would not make him a King; nor give him Power to make one Law: a <hi>Negative Voice</hi> is but a <hi>privative</hi> Power, that is, no Power at all to do or act
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93433:41"/>
any thing; but a Power only to hinder the Power of another. <hi>Negatives</hi> are of ſuch a malignant or deſtructive Nature, that if they have nothing elſe to deſtroy, they will, when they meet, deſtroy one another, which is the reaſon why two Negatives make an Affirmative, by deſtroying the Negation which did hinder the Affirmation. A King with a <hi>Negative Voice</hi> only, is but like a Syllogiſm of <hi>pure negative Propoſitions,</hi> which can conclude nothing. It muſt be an <hi>Affirmative Voice</hi> that makes both a <hi>King,</hi> and a <hi>Law,</hi> and without it there can be no imaginable Government.</p>
                     <p>The Reaſon is plain why the <hi>Kings Negative Voice</hi> is ſo eagerly oppoſed; for though it give the King no Power to do any thing; yet it gives him a Power to hinder others: though it cannot make him a King, yet it can help him to keep others from being Kings.</p>
                     <p>For Concluſion of this Diſcourſe of the <hi>negative Voice of the King,</hi> I ſhall oppoſe the Judgment of a <hi>Chief Juſtice of England</hi>; to the Opinion of him that calls himſelf an <hi>utter Barriſter of Lincolns Inn,</hi> and let others judge who is the better Lawyer of the two: the words are <hi>Bracton</hi>'s, but concern Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> to lay them to heart; <hi>Concerning the Charters and Deeds of Kings, the Juſtices nor private men neither ought, nor can diſpute; nor yet if there riſe a Doubt in the Kings Charter, can they interpret it; and in doubtful and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Points, or if a word contain two Senſes, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, and Will of our Lord the King is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, ſeeing it is His part to interpret, who makes the Charter:</hi> full well Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> knows, that when <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton</hi> writ, the Laws that were then made, and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for, were called the <hi>Kings Charters,</hi> as <hi>Magna Charta, Charta de Foresta,</hi> and others: ſo that in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93433:41"/>
                        <hi>Bracton</hi>'s Judgment the <hi>King</hi> hath not only a <hi>Negative Voice</hi> to hinder, but an <hi>Affirmative,</hi> to make a Law, which is a great deal more than Maſter <hi>Pryn</hi> will allow him.</p>
                     <p>Not only the <hi>Law-maker,</hi> but alſo the <hi>ſole Judge of the People is the King,</hi> in the Judgment of <hi>Bracton</hi>; theſe are his words: <hi>Rex &amp; non alius debet judicare, ſi ſolus ad id ſufficere poſſit,</hi> the King and no other ought to judge, if He alone were able. Much like the words of <hi>Bracton,</hi> ſpeaketh <hi>Briton,</hi> where, after that he had ſhewed that the <hi>King is the Vice-roy of God,</hi> and that he hath diſtributed his Charge into ſundry portions, becauſe He alone is not ſufficient to hear all Complaints of his People, then he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth theſe words, in the Perſon of the King: <hi>Nous volons que noſtre juriſdiction ſoit ſur touts Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c. We Will that Our Juriſdiction be above all the Juriſdictions of Our Realm, ſo as in all manner of Felonies, Treſpaſſes, Contracts, and in all other Actions Perſonal or Real, We have Power to yield, or cauſe to be yielded, ſuch Judgments as do appertain without other Proceſs, whereſoever we know the right Truth as Judges.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Neither was this to be taken, ſaith Mr. <hi>Lambard,</hi> to be meant of the <hi>Kings Bench, where there is only an imaginary preſence of His Perſon,</hi> but it muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be underſtood of a <hi>Juriſdiction remaining and left in the Kings Royal Body and Breast, diſtinct from that of His Bench, and other ordinary Courts</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth immediately after, ſeverally ſet forth by themſelves, as well the Authority of the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> as of the other Courts.</p>
                     <p>And that this was no new-made Law, Mr. <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard</hi> puts us in mind of a <hi>Saxon Law of King</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar's.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93433:42"/>
                        <hi>Nemo in lite Regem appellato,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Let no man in Suit appeal unto the King, unleſs he cannot get Right at home, but if that Right be too Heavy for him, then let him go to the King to have it eaſed.</hi> By which it may evidently appear, that even ſo many years ago <hi>there might be Appellation made to the Kings Perſon, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Cauſe ſhould enforce it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The very like Law in Effect is to be ſeen in the Laws of <hi>Canutus</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi> ſometimes King of this Realm, out of which Law Maſter <hi>Lambard</hi> gathers, that the <hi>King himſelf had a High Court of Justice, wherein it ſeemeth He ſate in Perſon</hi>; for the words be, <hi>Let him not ſeek to the King,</hi> and the ſame Court of the King did judge not only according to meer Right and Law, but alſo after Equity and good Conſcience.</p>
                     <p>For the Cloſe, I ſhall end with the Suffrage of our late Antiquary Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> in his <hi>Gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Omnis Regni Juſtitia ſolius Regis eſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>All Juſtice of the Kingdom is only the King's, and He alone, if He were able, ſhould adminiſter it; but that being impoſſible, He is forced to delegate it to Miniſters, whom he bounds by the limits of the Laws; the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Laws are only about Generals; in particular Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they are ſometimes too strict, ſometimes too remiſs; and ſo, oft Wrong inſtead of Right will be done, if we ſtand to ſtrict Law: alſo Cauſes hard and difficult dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ariſe, which are comprehended in no Law-books, in thoſe there is a neceſſity of running back to the King, the Fountain of Juſtice, and the Vicegerent of God himſelf, who in the Commonwealth of the Jews took ſuch Cauſes to His own cogniſance, and left to Kings not only the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of ſuch Juriſdiction, but the Prerogative alſo.</hi>

                     <p>WHat need all this ado, will ſome ſay, to ſift out what is compriſed in the Writ for the Election of the Commons to Parliament, ſince it is certain, though the <hi>Writ</hi> doth not, yet <hi>Privilege</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> gives ſufficient Power for all Proceedings of the Two Houſes? It is anſwered, that what ſlight Eſteem ſoever be made of the Writ, yet in all other caſes the <hi>Original</hi> Writ is the Foundation of the whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or action: and to vary in Subſtance from the Writ, makes a Nullity in the Cauſe, and the Proceedings thereupon: and where a Commiſſioner exerciſeth more Power than is warranted by his Commiſſion, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuch Act is void, and in many Caſes puniſhable: yet we will lay aſide the Writ, and apply our ſelves to conſider the Nature of <hi>Privilege</hi> of <hi>Parliament.</hi> The Task is the more difficult, for that we are not told what the number of <hi>Privileges</hi> are, or which they be; ſome do think that as there be dormant Articles of Faith in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> which are not yet decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; ſo there be likewiſe Privileges dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant in the Houſe of Commons, not yet
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93433:43"/>
revealed, we muſt therefore be content in a generality to diſcourſe of the Quality or Condition of Privilege of Parliament, and to confine our ſelves to theſe three points:
<list>
                           <item>1. That Privilege of Parliament gives no Power; but only helps to the execution of the Power given by the Writ.</item>
                           <item>2. That the Free-holders by their Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons give no Privilege.</item>
                           <item>3. That Privilege of Parliament is the Gift of the King.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, The End or Scope of Privilege of Parliament is not to give any Power to do any Publick Act, not warranted by the Writ: but they are intended as Helps only to enable to the Performance of the Duty enjoyned, and ſo are ſubſervient to the Power compriſed in the Writ: For Inſtance, the <hi>grand Privilege of Freedom from Arreſts</hi> doth not give any Power at all to the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> to do any Act; but by taking away from the Free-holders and other Subjects the Power of Arreſts, the Commons are the better inabled to attend the Service to which they are called by the King.</p>
                     <p>In many other Caſes the Servants, or Miniſters of the King are privileged, and protected much in the ſame Nature. The
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93433:43"/>
Servants in Houſhold to the King may not be arreſted without ſpecial Licence: Alſo the Officers of the Kings Courts of Juſtice, having a Privilege not to be ſued in any other Court but where they ſerve and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; and to this Purpoſe they are allowed a <hi>Writ of Privilege.</hi> Likewiſe all ſuch as ſerve the King in his Wars, as are imployed on Foreign Affairs for him, are protected from Actions and Sutes. Nay the King's Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction deſcends to the privileging even of <hi>Laundreſſes, Nurſes,</hi> and <hi>Midwives,</hi> if they attend upon the Camp, as Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> ſaith, <hi>quia Lotrix, ſeu Nutrix, ſeu obſtetrix.</hi> Beſides the King protects his Debtors from Arreſts of the Subject till his own Debts be paid.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ſorts of Protections are Privileges the Common Law takes Notice of, and allows: and hath ſeveral Diſtinctions of them; and ſome are <hi>Protections, quia profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturus,</hi> and others are, <hi>quia moraturus:</hi> ſome are with a Clauſe of <hi>Volumus</hi> for Stay of Suits: others with a Clauſe of <hi>Nolumus</hi> for the Safety of mens Perſons, Servants, and Goods: and the King's Writs do vary herein according to the Nature of the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.</p>
                     <p>But none of theſe Privileges or Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do give any Power; they are not <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive,</hi>
                        <pb n="70" facs="tcp:93433:44"/>
but <hi>privative:</hi> they take away and deprive the Subject of the Power, or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to arreſt, or ſue, in ſome caſes only; no Protection or Privilege doth defend in point of <hi>Treaſon, Felony,</hi> or <hi>Breach</hi> of the <hi>Peace</hi>: Privileges are directly contrary to the Law, for otherwiſe they ſhould not be Privileges, and they are to be interpreted in the ſtricteſt manner, as being <hi>odious and contrary</hi> to Law: we ſee the Uſe of Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges; they do but ſerve as a Diſpenſation againſt Law, intended originally, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally for the expediting of the Kings Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; though ſecondarily, and by accident there do ſometimes redound a Benefit by them to the Parties themſelves that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected. Strictly, and properly every Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege muſt be againſt a publick or common Law, for there is no Uſe or Need of a <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Law</hi> to protect, where there is no <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Law</hi> to the contrary: Favours and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are only <hi>beſides,</hi> and <hi>not againſt</hi> the Law, do not properly go under the name of <hi>Privileges,</hi> though common Uſe do not diſtinguiſh them: I know no other Privilege that can be truly ſo called, and to belong to the Houſe of Commons, which is ſo vaſt and great, as this Privilege of their <hi>Perſons, Servants,</hi> and <hi>Goods:</hi> this being indeed againſt the Common Law,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93433:44"/>
and doth concern the whole Kingdom to take notice of it, if they muſt be bound by it.</p>
                     <p>Touching this grand Privilege of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from Arreſts, I read, that in the 33 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. the Commons did not proceed to the Puniſhment of Offenders for the breach of it, until the Lords referred the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof to the Lower Houſe. The Caſe is thus reported, <hi>George Ferrers</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, Servant to the King, and Burgeſs for <hi>Plymouth,</hi> going to the Parliament-Houſe was arreſted in <hi>London,</hi> by Proceſs out of the Kings Bench for Debt, wherein he had before been condemned as Surety for one <hi>Welden,</hi> at the Sute of one <hi>White:</hi> which Arreſt, ſignified to Sir <hi>Thomas Moyl,</hi> Speaker, and to the reſt; the Serjeant (called <hi>Saint-Johns</hi>) was ſent to the Counter in <hi>Bread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet</hi> to demand <hi>Ferrers:</hi> The Officer of the Counter refuſed to deliver him, and gave the Serjeant ſuch ill Language, that they fall to an Affray: the Sheriff coming, taketh the Officers part, the Serjeant returned without the Priſoner: This being related to the Speaker and Burgeſſes, they would ſit no more without their Burgeſs; and riſing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to the Upper Houſe, where the Caſe was declared by the Speaker before Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Audley Chancellor, and the Lords and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93433:45"/>
Judges</hi> there aſſembled, who judging <hi>the Contempt to be very great, referred the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment thereof to the Houſe of Commons it ſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Privilege of Freedom from Arreſts is the only Privilege which Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> finds to belong to the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; he cannot, or at leaſt he doth not, ſo much as name any other in his Section of the <hi>Privileges</hi> of <hi>Parliament:</hi> neither doth he bring ſo much as one Precedent for the Proof of this one Privilege for the Houſe of Commons; which may cauſe a Doubt that this ſole Privilege is not ſo clear as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do imagine. For in a Parliament in the 27 <hi>Eliz. Richard Coke,</hi> a Member, being ſerved with a <hi>Subpoena of Chancery, the Lord Chancellor thought the Houſe had no ſuch Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege for Subpoena's as they pretended</hi>; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would he allow of any Precedents of the Houſe committed unto them, formerly uſed in that Behalf, unleſs the Houſe of Commons could alſo prove the ſame to have been likewiſe thereupon allowed, and ratified alſo by Precedents in the Court of Chancery.</p>
                     <p>In the 39 of <hi>Eliz.</hi> Sir <hi>Edw. Hobby,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Brograve,</hi> Attorney of the Dutchy, were ſent by the Houſe to the Lord Keeper, in the name of the whole Houſe, to <hi>require</hi> his Lordſhip to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93433:45"/>
revoke two Writs of <hi>Subpoena's,</hi> which were ſerved upon M. <hi>Th. Knevit,</hi> a Member of the Houſe, ſince the Beginning of Parliament. The Lord Keeper demanded of them whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were appointed by any adviſed Conſideration of the Houſe, to deliver this Meſſage unto him with the word <hi>Required,</hi> in ſuch manner as they had done, or no: they anſwered his Lordſhip, yea: his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip then ſaid, as he thought reverently and honourably of the Houſe, and of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and Privileges of the ſame, ſo <hi>to revoke the ſaid Subpoena's in that ſort, was to reſtrain Her Majeſty in Her greatest Power, which is, Juſtice in the Place wherein he ſerveth under Her,</hi> and therefore he concluded, As they had <hi>required</hi> him to revoke his Writ, ſo he did <hi>require</hi> to <hi>deliberate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon the 22 of <hi>February,</hi> being Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, 18 <hi>Eliz.</hi> Report was made by Mr. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney of the Dutchy, upon the Committee, for the delivering of one Mr. <hi>Hall</hi>'s man; that the Committee found <hi>no Precedent for ſetting at large by the Mace any Perſon in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest but only by Writ,</hi> and that by divers Precedents of Records peruſed by the ſaid Committee, it appeareth that every Knight, Citizen, or Burgeſs, which doth require Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, hath uſed in that caſe to take a Corporal Oath before the Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,

or Lord Keeper, that the <hi>party</hi> for whom ſuch Writ is prayed, <hi>Came up with him, and was his Servant at the time of the Arreſt made.</hi> Thereupon M. <hi>Hall</hi> was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Houſe to repair to the Lord Keeper, and make Oath, and then take a Warrant for a Writ of Privilege for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>
                     <p>It is accounted by ſome to be a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Parliament to have power to Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine <hi>Miſdemeanours</hi> of Courts of Juſtice, and Officers of State: yet there is not the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Subject but hath liberty, upon juſt cauſe, to queſtion the miſdemeanour of any Court or <hi>Officer,</hi> if he ſuffer by them; there is no Law againſt him for ſo doing; ſo that this cannot properly be called a Privilege, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not againſt any publick Law: It hath been eſteemed a great Favour of <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> to permit ſuch Examinations: For, when the Lords were diſpleaſed with the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Pierce Gaveſton,</hi> it is ſaid, that in the next Parliament, <hi>the whole Aſſembly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the King to draw Articles of their Grievances,</hi> which they did.

and Reaſoning, any man in the Commons Houſe ſhould ſpeak more largely than of Duty they ought to do, that all ſuch Offences ſhould be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and to be entred of Record; which was granted.</hi> It is obſervable in this Petition, that Liberty or Freedom of Speech is not a Power for men to ſpeak what they will, or pleaſe, in Parliament; but a Privilege not to be puniſhed, but pardoned for the Offence of ſpeaking <hi>more largely than in Duty ought to be</hi>; which in an equitable Conſtruction muſt be underſtood of raſh, unadviſed, ignorant, or negligent Eſcapes, and Slips in Speech: and not for wilful, malicious Offences in that kind; And then the Pardon of the King was deſired to be upon Record, that it might be pleaded in Bar to all Actions. And it ſeemeth that <hi>Ric.

                     <p>35 <hi>Eliz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Peter Wentworth,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Bromley</hi> delivered a Petition to the Lord Keeper, deſiring the Lords of the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Houſe to be Suppliants with them of the Lower Houſe, unto her Majeſty, for <hi>entail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Succeſſion of the Crown.</hi> Whereof a Bill was ready drawn by them.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93433:48"/>
their Courts, uſed towards ſundry Learned, and godly Miniſters and Preachers; and ſpake againſt Subſcriptions and Oaths; and offer'd a Bill to be read againſt Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for refuſal of Oaths: Mr. <hi>Dalton</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Reading of it, as a thing expreſly againſt Her Majeſties Command, to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in: Doctor <hi>Lewin</hi> ſhewed, that Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption was uſed even at <hi>Geneva</hi>: At two of the clock the ſame day, the Speaker, Mr. <hi>Coke,</hi> (afterwards Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi>) was ſent for to the Court, where the Queen Her ſelf gave him in Command a Meſſage to the Houſe: She told him, <hi>It being wholly in Her Power to Call, to Determine, to Aſſent, or Diſſent to any thing done in Parliament: that the Calling of This was only, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God might be more religiouſly obſerved, by compelling, by ſome ſharp Laws, ſuch as neglect that Service: and that the Safety of Her Majeſties Perſon, and the Realm might be provided for: It was not meant they ſhould meddle with Matters of State, or Cauſes Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical,</hi> (for ſo Her Majeſty termed them) <hi>ſhe wondred that any could be of ſo high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, to attempt</hi> (they were Her own words) <hi>a thing ſo expreſly contrary to that which ſhe had commanded: wherefore with this She was highly offended: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the words ſpoken by my Lord Keeper are
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93433:49"/>
not now perhaps well remembred, or ſome be now here that were not then preſent. Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties preſent Charge and expreſs Command is, that no Bill touching the ſaid matter of State, or Reformation in Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited; and upon my Allegiance</hi> (ſaith Mr. Coke) <hi>I am charged, if any ſuch Bill be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, not to read it.</hi> I have been credibly informed, that the Queen ſent a Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or Serjeant at Arms, into the Houſe of Commons, and took out Mr. <hi>Morrice,</hi> and committed him to Priſon: within few days after, I find Mr. <hi>Wroth</hi> moved in the Houſe, that they might be humble Suitors to Her Majeſty, that She would be pleaſed to ſet at liberty thoſe Members of the Houſe that were reſtrained. To this it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by the Privy Counſellors, That <hi>Her Majeſty had committed them for Cauſes beſt known to Her ſelf, and to preſs Her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with this Suit, would but hinder them whoſe Good is ſought</hi>: that <hi>the Houſe muſt not call the Queen to account for what ſhe doth of Her Royal Authority: that the Cauſes for which they are reſtrained may be High and Dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: that Her Majeſty liketh no ſuch Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; neither doth it become the Houſe to ſearch into ſuch matters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the 39 <hi>Eliz.</hi> The Commons were told their Privilege was <hi>Yea,</hi> and <hi>No:</hi> and that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93433:49"/>
Her Majeſties Pleaſure was, that if the Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er perceived any idle Heads which would not ſtick to hazard their own Eſtates; which will meddle with reforming the Church, and transforming the Commonweal, and do exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit Bills to that purpoſe; the Speaker ſhould not receive them till they were viewed and conſidered by thoſe, whom it is fitter ſhould conſider of ſuch things, and can better judge of them: and at the end of this Parliament, the Queen refuſed to paſs 48 Bills which had paſſed both Houſes.</p>
                     <p>In the 28 of <hi>Eliz.</hi> the Queen ſaid, <hi>She was ſorry the Commons medled with chuſing and returning Knights of the Shire for</hi> Norfolk, <hi>a thing impertinent for the Houſe to deal withal, and only belonging to the Office and Charge of the Lord Chancellor, from whom the Writs iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue and are returned.</hi>

                     <p>4 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. The 10 of <hi>October,</hi> the <hi>Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi> before the <hi>King</hi> declared, <hi>the Commons had ſent to the King, praying him that they might have Advice, and Communication with certain Lords about Matters of Buſineſs in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, for the common good of the Realm:</hi> which Prayer <hi>Our Lord the King graciouſly granted, making Proteſtation, he would not do it of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor of Cuſtom, but of his ſpecial Grace at this time:</hi> and therefore <hi>Our Lord the King charged the Clerk of the Parliament, that this
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93433:50"/>
Proteſtation ſhould be entred on Record upon the Parliament-Roll:</hi> which the King made known to them by the Lord <hi>Say,</hi> and his Secretary; <hi>how that neither of Due nor of Cuſtom, our Lord the King ought to grant any Lords to enter into Communication with them, of Matters touching the Parliament; but by his ſpecial Grace at this time he hath granted their Requeſt in this Particular</hi>: upon which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the ſaid Steward and Secretary made Report to the King in Parliament; that the ſaid <hi>Commons knew well that they could not have any ſuch Lords to commune with them, of any Buſineſs of Parliament, without ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace and Command of the King Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It hath heretofore been a queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not an Infringing, and Prejudice to the Liberties and Privileges of the Houſe of Commons, for them to joyn in Conference with the Lords in Caſes of Benevolence, or Contribution, without a Bill.</p>
                     <p>In the 35 <hi>Eliz.</hi> on Tueſday the firſt of <hi>March,</hi> Mr. <hi>Egerton,</hi> Attorney General, and Doct. <hi>Cary</hi> came with a Meſſage from the Lords; their Lordſhips deſired to put the Houſe in remembrance of the Speech deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the Lord Keeper, the firſt day, for Conſultation and Proviſion of Treaſure, to be had againſt the great and imminent Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93433:50"/>
of the Realm; thereupon their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips did look to have ſomething from the Houſes, touching thoſe Cauſes before this time (and yet the Parliament had ſate but three days, for it began <hi>Feb.</hi> 26.) and therefore their Lordſhips had hitherto omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to do any thing therein themſelves. And thereupon their Lordſhips deſired, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to former laudable Uſages between both Houſes in ſuch like Caſes, a Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of Commons may have Conference with a Committee of Lords, touching Proviſion of Treaſure againſt the great Dangers of the Realm, which was preſently reſolved by the whole Houſe, and they ſignified to their Lordſhips the willing, and ready Aſſent of the whole Houſe. At the Meeting, the Lords negatively affirm, not to aſſent to leſs than three Subſidies, and do inſiſt for a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Conference. M. <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Subſidy, but oppoſed the joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Lords, as contrary to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of the Houſe of Commons; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Houſe reſolved to have no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the Lords, but to give their Lordſhips moſt humble and dutiful Thanks with all Reverence for their favourable and courteous Offer of Conference, and to ſignifie, that the Commons cannot in thoſe Caſes of Benevolence, or Contribution joyn
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93433:51"/>
in Conference with their Lordſhips, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Prejudice to the Liberties and Privileges of the Houſe: and to requeſt their Lordſhips to hold the Members of this Houſe excuſed in their Not aſſenting to their Lordſhips ſaid Motion for Conference, for that ſo to have Aſſented without a Bill, had been contrary to the Liberties and Privileges of this Houſe, and alſo contrary to the former Precedents of the ſame Houſe in like caſes had. This Anſwer delivered to the Lords by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, their Lordſhips ſaid, they well hoped to have had a Conference accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their former Requeſt, and deſir'd to ſee thoſe Precedents by which the Commons ſeem to refuſe the ſaid Conference. But in Concluſion it was agreed unto, upon the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi>; who moved, that without naming a Subſidy, it might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in general words, to have a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence touching the Dangers of the Realm, and the neceſſary Supply of Treaſure to be provided ſpeedily for the ſame, according to the Proportion of the Neceſſity.</p>
                     <p>In the 43 <hi>Eliz.</hi> Serjeant <hi>Heal</hi> ſaid in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, <hi>He marvail'd the Houſe ſtood either at the granting of a Subſidy or time of Payment, when all we have is her Majeſties, and She may lawfully at her Pleaſure take it from us; and that ſhe had as much Right to all our Lands and Goods, as to any Revenue of the Crown; and he ſaid he could prove
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93433:51"/>
it by Precedents in the time of</hi> H. 3. <hi>K.</hi> John <hi>and</hi> K. <hi>Stephen.</hi> The ground upon w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> this Serjeant at Law went, may be thought the ſame Sir <hi>Ed. Coke</hi> delivers in his <hi>Inſtitutes,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>the firſt Kings of this Realm had all the Lands of</hi> England <hi>in Demeſne, and the great Manors and Royalties they reſerved to themſelves, and of the remnant for the defence of the Kingdom, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feoffed the Barons:</hi> from whence it appears, that no man holds any <hi>Lands</hi> but under a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to defend the Realm; and upon the ſelf-ſame Ground alſo the Kings Prerogative is raiſed, as being a Preheminence, in caſes of Neceſſity, above, and before the Law of Property, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. Certain it is, before the Commons were ever choſen to come to Parliament, Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es or Subſidies were raiſed and paid without their gift. The great and long continued Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidy of <hi>Dane-gelt</hi> was without any Gift of the <hi>Commons,</hi> or of any <hi>Parliament</hi> at all, that can be proved. In the 8 <hi>H.</hi> 3. a Subſidy of 2 Marks in Silver upon every Knights ſee was granted to the <hi>King</hi> by the <hi>Nobles,</hi> without any <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</hi> At the paſſing of a Bill of Subſidies, the words of the King are, <hi>the King thanks his loyal Subjects, accepts their good Will, and alſo will have it ſo: le Roy remercie ſes loyaux Subjects, accept leur benevolence,</hi> &amp; auſi ainſi le veult: which laſt words of <hi>ainſi le veult, the King wills it to be ſo,</hi> are the only words that makes the Act of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidy a Law to bind every man to the Payment of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="86" facs="tcp:93433:52"/>In the 39 <hi>Eliz.</hi> The Commons, by their Speaker, complaining of <hi>Monopolies,</hi> the Queen ſpake in private to the L. Keeper, who then made anſwer touching Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, that <hi>Her Majeſty hoped her dutiful and loving Subjects would not take away her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, which is the chiefest Flower in her Garland, and the principal and head Pearl in Her Crown and Diadem</hi>; but <hi>that they will rather leave that to Her Diſpoſition.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond Point is, that the Free-hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or Counties do not, nor cannot give Privilege to the Commons in Parliament. They that are under the Law cannot protect againſt it, they have no ſuch Privilege them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as to be free from Arreſts and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for if they had, then it had been no Privilege, but it would be the Common-Law: And what they have not, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give; <hi>Nemo dat quod non habet,</hi> neither do the Free-holders pretend to give any ſuch Privilege, either at their Election, or by any ſubſequent Act; there is no mention of any ſuch thing in the Return of the Writ; nor in the Indentures between the Sheriff, and the Free-holders.</p>
                     <p>The third Point remains, That Privilege of Parliament is granted by the <hi>King.</hi> It is a known Rule, <hi>that which gives the Form, gives the Conſequences of the Form</hi>; the <hi>King</hi>
                        <pb n="87" facs="tcp:93433:52"/>
by his Writ gives the very Eſſence and Form to the Parliament: therefore Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which are but Conſequences of the Form, muſt neceſſarily flow from Kings.</p>
                     <p>All other Privileges and Protections are the Acts of the King; and by the Kings Writ. Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> ſaith, that the <hi>Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mens Perſons, Servants, and Goods, is done by a Writ of Grace from the King.</hi> At the preſentment of the Speaker of the Houſe of Commons to the King upon the firſt day of Parliament, The Speaker in the Name and Behoof of the Commons, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly craveth that his Majeſty would be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pleaſed to grant them their accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed Liberties and Privileges; which Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of theirs, is a fair Recognition of the Primitive Grace and Favour of Kings in be ſtowing of Privilege, and it is a ſhrewd Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt any other Title: For our Anceſtors were not ſo ceremonious nor ſo full of Complement, as to beg that by <hi>Grace,</hi> which they might claim by <hi>Right.</hi> And the Renewing of this Petition every Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, argues the Grant to be but tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, during only the preſent Parliament; and that they have been accuſtomed, when they have been accuſtomably ſued, or petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for. I will cloſe this Point with the Judgment of King <hi>James,</hi> who in his Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93433:53"/>
touching his Proceedings in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 1621. reſolves, <hi>that most Privileges of Parliament grew from Precedents, which rather ſhew a Toleration than an Inheritance; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could not allow of the Style, calling it their ancient and undoubted Right and Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but could rather have wiſhed that they had ſaid, their Privileges were derived from the Grace and Permiſſion of his Anceſtors and Him:</hi> and thereupon he concludes, <hi>He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with Patience endure his Subjects to uſe ſuch Antimonarchical words concerning their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, except they had ſubjoyned, that they were granted unto them by the Grace and Favours of his Predeceſſors:</hi> yet he promiſeth <hi>to be careful of whatſoever. Privileges they enjoy by long Cuſtom and uncontrolled and lawful Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents.</hi>

                  <head>THE PREFACE</head>
                  <p>IN every Alteration of Government there is ſomething new, which none can either Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, or Judge of, till time hath tried it: we read of many ſeveral ways of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but they have all, or moſt of them, been of particular Cities, with none, or very ſmall Territories at firſt belonging to them. At this preſent the Government of the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,</hi> and of <hi>Swiſſerland,</hi> are not appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted either of them to any one City, for they are compounded of ſeveral petty Principalities, which have ſpecial and different Laws and Privileges each of them; inſomuch that the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces, and united Cantons are but Confederacies and Leaguers, and not two en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Commonweals; Aſſociates only for mutual Defence. Nay, the Cantons of <hi>Swiſſerland</hi> are not only ſeveral Republicks, but reputed to have different Forms of Commonweals; ſome being ſaid to be Ariſtocratically governed, and
<pb facs="tcp:93433:55"/>
others Democratically, as the Mountaineers: and ſome of the Cantons are Papists, and ſome Protestants, and ſome mix'd of both: we do not find that any large or great Dominion or Kingdom united in one Government, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame Laws, was ever reduced at once to any kind of Popular Government, and not confined to the ſubjection of one City: This being a thing not yet done, requires the abler men to ſettle ſuch a Peaceable Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as is to be deſired: there being no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent in the caſe; all that can be done in it, is, at firſt to enquire into ſuch Governments, as have been exiſtent in the World. As a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to ſuch an Enquiry, the Sacred Scripture (if it be but for the Antiquity of it) would be conſulted; and then <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> the grand Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Politiques; and after him the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Historians that lived in Popular times, would be diligently examined. To excite others of greater Abilities to an exacter Diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, I preſume to offer a Taſte of ſome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> which are uſher'd in with a briefer Touch of the Holy Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>It is not probable, that any ſure direction of the beginning of Government, can be found ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle, Cicero, Polybius,</hi> or in any other of the Heathen Authors, who were ignorant of the manner of the Creation of the World: we muſt not neglect the Scriptures, and
<pb facs="tcp:93433:55"/>
ſearch in Philoſophers for the grounds of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Property, which are the main Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Government and Juſtice. The first Government in the World was Monarchical, in the Father of all Fleſh. <hi>Adam</hi> being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to multiply, and People the Earth, and to ſubdue it, and having Dominion given him over all Creatures, was thereby the Monarch of the whole World; none of his Poſterity had any Right to poſſeſs any thing, but by His Grant or Permiſſion, or by Succeſſion from him: <hi>the Earth</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt) hath he given to the children of men:</hi> which ſhews, the Title comes from Fatherhood. There never was any ſuch thing as an Independent Multitude, who at firſt had a natural Right to a Community: this is but a Fiction, or Fancy of too many in theſe days, who pleaſe themſelves in running after the Opinions of <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>Poets,</hi> to find out ſuch an Original of Government, as might promiſe them ſome title to Liberty, to the great Scandal of Chriſtianity, and Bringing in of Atheiſm, ſince a natural freedom of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind cannot be ſuppoſed without the denial of the Creation of <hi>Adam.</hi> And yet this conceit of Original Freedom is the only Ground upon which not only the Heathen Philoſophers, but alſo the Authors of the Principles of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Law; and <hi>Grotius, Selden, Hobs, Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam,</hi> and others raiſe, and build their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
<pb facs="tcp:93433:56"/>
of Government, and of the ſeveral ſorts or kinds, as they call them, of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adam</hi> was the Father, King, and Lord over his Family: a Son, a Subject, and a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant or a Slave, were one and the ſame thing at firſt; the Father had power to diſpoſe, or ſell his Children or Servants; whence we find, that at the firſt reckoning up of Goods in Scripture, the Man ſervant, and the Maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant are numbred among the Poſſeſſions and Subſtance of the Owner, as other Goods were. As for the names of Subject, Slave, and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, they are not found in Scripture, but what we now call a Subject or a Slave, is there named no other than a Servant: I cannot learn that either the <hi>Hebrew, Greek,</hi> or <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> have any proper and Original Word for a Tyrant or a Slave, it ſeems theſe are names of later invention, and taken up in diſgrace of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical Government.</p>
                  <p>I cannot find any one place, or Text in the Bible, where any Power or Commiſſion is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a People either to Govern themſelves, or to chooſe themſelves Governours, or to alter the manner of Government at their pleaſure; the Power of Government is ſettled and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Commandment of <hi>Honour thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> if there were a higher Power than the Fatherly, then this Commandment could not
<pb facs="tcp:93433:56"/>
ſtand, and be obſerved: Whereas we read in Scripture, of ſome Actions of the People in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of Kings, further than to a naked De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration by a part of the People of their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, ſuch Actions could not amount, ſince we find no Commiſſion they have, to beſtow any Right; a true repreſentation of the People to be made, is as impoſſible, as for the whole People to Govern; the names of an <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> a <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy,</hi> a <hi>Commonweal,</hi> a <hi>State,</hi> or any other of like ſignification, are not to be met either in the Law or Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>That there is a ground in Nature for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, <hi>Ariſtotle himſelf</hi> affirmeth, ſaying, the <hi>firſt Kings were Fathers of Families;</hi> as for any ground of any other Form of Government, there hath been none yet alledged, but a ſuppoſed natural Freedom of Mankind; the Proof where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I find none do undertake, but only beg it to be granted. We find the Government of Gods own People varied under the ſeveral Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of Patriarchs, Captains, Judges, and Kings; but in all theſe the Supreme Power reſted ſtill in one Perſon onely: We no where find any Supreme Power given to the People, or to a Multitude in Scripture, or ever exerciſed by them. The People were never the <hi>Lords anointed,</hi> nor called <hi>Gods,</hi> nor Crowned, nor had the Title of <hi>Nurſing-Fathers, Gen. 35.11.</hi> The Supreme Power being an indiviſible Beam
<pb facs="tcp:93433:57"/>
of Majeſty, cannot be divided among, or ſettled upon a Multitude. God would have it fixed in one Perſon, not ſometimes in one part of the People, and ſometimes in another; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and that for the moſt part, no where, as when the Aſſembly is diſſolved, it muſt reſt in the Air, or in the walls of the Chamber where they were Aſſembled.</p>
                  <p>If there were any thing like a Popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment among Gods People, it was about the time of the <hi>Judges,</hi> when there was <hi>no King in Iſrael;</hi> for they had then ſome ſmall Show of Government, ſuch as it was, but it was ſo poor and beggarly, that the Scripture brands it with this note, that <hi>every man did what was right in his own eyes, becauſe there was no King in Iſrael;</hi> it is not ſaid, becauſe there was no <hi>Government,</hi> but becauſe there was no <hi>King;</hi> it ſeems no <hi>Government,</hi> but the Government of a King, in the judgment of the Scriptures, could reſtrain men from doing what they liſted; where every man doth what he pleaſeth, it may be truly ſaid, there is no Government; for the end of Government is, that every man ſhould not do what he pleaſeth, or be his own Judge in his own caſe; for the Scripture to ſay there was no King, is to ſay, there was no Form of Government in <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And what the Old Teſtament teacheth us, we have confirmed in the New: If Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:93433:57"/>
had only ſaid, <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject to the Higher Powers,</hi> and ſaid no more: then men might have diſputed, whether Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> by <hi>Higher Powers,</hi> had not meant as well other Governours as Kings; or other Forms of Government, as Monarchy; but the good luck is, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath been his own Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter or Comment: for, after the general Doctrine of Obedience to be given by all men to the <hi>Higher Powers,</hi> he proceeds next to charge it home, and lay it to the Conſcience under pain of Damnation, and applies it to each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man's Conſcience; ſaying, <hi>Wilt thou not be afraid of the Power?</hi> which Power he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds in the Singular Number, reſtraining it to one Perſon, ſaying, <hi>He is the Miniſter of God to thee;</hi> it is not, <hi>They are the Miniſters to thee;</hi> and then again, <hi>He beareth not the Sword in vain;</hi> and then a third time in the ſame Verſe, leſt thou ſhould'ſt forget it, he ſaith, <hi>for He is the Miniſter of God, a Revenger to Wrath, &amp;c. upon thee:</hi> if Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had ſaid, <hi>They are the Miniſters of God,</hi> or <hi>They bear not the Sword in vain,</hi> it might be doubted, whether [they] were meant of Kings only, or of other Governours alſo; but this Scruple is taken away by the Apoſtle himſelf. And as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath expounded what he means by <hi>Higher Powers,</hi> ſo Saint <hi>Peter</hi> alſo doth the like: for the ſelf-ſame Word that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth
<pb facs="tcp:93433:58"/>
for <hi>Higher,</hi> in Saint <hi>Peter</hi> is tranſlated <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme;</hi> ſo that though in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bibles the words differ, yet in the Original they are both the ſame; ſo that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> might have been Engliſhed, <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject to the Supreme Power;</hi> or Saint <hi>Peter</hi> might have been Tranſlated, <hi>whether to the King as to the higher;</hi> ye there is this difference, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth the word in the Plural Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> hath it in the Singular, and with Application to the King.</p>
                  <p>It will be ſaid, Though Saint <hi>Peter</hi> make the King Supreme, yet he tells us the King is a <hi>Humane Ordinance,</hi> or a Creature of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. But it is anſwered, Kings may be called an Humane Ordinance, for being made of one of the People, and not by the People; and ſo are humane in Regard of their <hi>Material</hi> Cauſe, not of their <hi>Efficient.</hi> If Saint <hi>Peter</hi> had meant that Kings had been made by the People, he must alſo have meant that Governours had been made by the People, for he calls the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours as well an Ordinance of Man, as the King; for his words are, <hi>Submit your ſelves to every Ordinance of man for the Lord's ſake, whether it be to the King as Supreme, or whether it be to Governours: but</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſheweth, that Governours are not made by the People; for he ſaith, <hi>they that are ſent by Him</hi> (not by them) <hi>for the Puniſhment
<pb facs="tcp:93433:58"/>
of Evil Doers:</hi> ſo that the Governours are ſent by the King, and not by the People: ſome would have <hi>ſent by him,</hi> to be <hi>ſent by God;</hi> but the Relative must be referred to the next Antecedent, which is the King, and not God. Beſides, if Governours be ſent by God, and Kings by the People, then Governours would be Supreme, which is contrary to Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Doctrine; and it will follow, that the People have not the Power of chooſing Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters to Govern, if Governours muſt be ſent of God.</p>
                  <p>The ſafest ſenſe of Saint <hi>Peter</hi>'s words is; <hi>Submit your ſelves to all Humane Laws, whether made by the King, or by his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Governours.</hi> So the King may be called a Humane Ordinance, as being all one with a <hi>Speaking Law:</hi> the Word in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal is, <hi>Be ſubject to every Humane Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> it is more proper to call a Law made by a King a Creation of an Ordinance, than the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples chooſing or declaring of a King, a Creation of him.</p>
                  <p>But take the words in what ſenſe ſoever you will, it is moſt evident, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in this place, takes no notice of any Government or Governours, but of a King, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours ſent by him, but not by the People. And it is to be noted, That St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the two chief of the Apoſtles, wrote their Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb facs="tcp:93433:59"/>
at ſuch a time, when the name of a Popular Government, or of the People of <hi>Rome</hi> was at leaſt ſo much in Shew and in Name, that many do believe, That notwithſtanding the Emperours by ſtrong hand uſurped a Military Power; yet the Government was for a long time in most things then in the Senate and People of <hi>Rome;</hi> but for all this, neither of the two Apostles take any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of any ſuch Popular Government; No, nor our Saviour himſelf, who divides all between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and allows nothing that we can find for the People.</p>

                  <p>WHAT cannot be found in <hi>Scripture,</hi> many do look for in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>; for if there be any other Form of Government beſides Monarchy, he is the man beſt able to tell what it is, and to let us know by what name to call it, ſince the Greek Tongue is moſt happy in compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Names, moſt ſignificant to expreſs the nature of moſt things: The uſual Terms in this Age of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocraty</hi> and <hi>Democraty</hi> are taken up from him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Forms of Government moſt different from <hi>Monarchy:</hi> We muſt therefore make inquiry into <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> touching theſe two Terms.</p>

The Tranſgreſſions of Government before spoken of, are theſe: Tyranny is the Tranſgreſſion of the Kingdom; and Democraty is the Tranſgreſſion of the Polity. For Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny is a Monarchy for the Benefit of the Monarch, the Oligarchy, for the Profit of the Rich; the Democraty for the Benefit of the Poor. None of theſe are for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> if he had ſtood to his own Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ſhould have ſaid <hi>an Oligarchy ſhould be for the Benefit of a few, and thoſe the beſt; and not for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Rich: and a Democraty for the Benefit of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and not of the Poor only</hi>; for ſo the Oppoſition <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93433:60"/>
his <hi>Oligarchy</hi> would not be for the Benefit of a few, and thoſe the beſt men; for they cannot be the beſt men, that ſeek only their private Profit. In this Chapter, the mind of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> about the ſeveral kinds of Government, is clearlieſt delivered, as being the Foundation of all his Books of Politicks, it is the more neceſſary to make a curious Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe his Doctrines. In the firſt place, he acknowledgeth the Government of <hi>one man,</hi> or of a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and that is a perfect Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

ſeek in deſcribing his imperfect Forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well <hi>Oligarchies</hi> as <hi>Democracies,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is driven to invent ſeveral ſorts of them, and to confound himſelf with Subdiviſions: we will alledge ſome of his words. <hi>The cauſe why there be many kinds of Commonweals is, for that there are many parts of every City. Sometimes all theſe parts are in a Commonweal, ſometimes more of them, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fewer: whence it is manifeſt, that there are many Commonweals differing from each other in kind: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the parts of them differ after the ſame manner. For a Commonweal is the Order of Magiſtrates diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, either according to the Power of them that are partakers of it, or according to ſome other common equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity belonging to Poor and Rich, or ſome other thing common to both. It is therefore neceſſary, that there be ſo many Commonweals as there are Orders, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the excellencies and differences of Parts. But it ſeemeth principally there are but two chief kinds of Commonweals; the</hi> Democracy <hi>and the</hi> Oligarchy: <hi>for they make the</hi> Ariſtocracy <hi>a branch of</hi> Oligarchy, <hi>as if it were a kind of</hi> Oligarchy; <hi>and that other which is properly a</hi> Policy, <hi>to be a branch of</hi> Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy. <hi>So they are wont to esteem of Commonweals; but it is both truer and better; that there being two right Forms, or one, that all the other be tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Here we find <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> of ſeveral minds, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he is for many Commonweals, ſometimes for two, or ſometimes for one. As for his many Commonweals, if he allow them according to the ſeveral parts of a City, he may as well make three thouſand kinds of Commonweals, as three: if two Artificers and three Souldiers ſhould govern, that ſhould be one kind of Commonweal: if four Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen,

and five Merchants, that would be a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſort; or ſix Taylors, and ten Carpenters, a third ſort; or a dozen Saylors, and a dozen Porters, a fourth; and ſo in <hi>infinitum,</hi> for <hi>Aristotle</hi> is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved how many parts to make of a City, or how many Combinations of thoſe Parts; and therefore in his Reckoning of them, he differs from himſelf, ſometimes makes more, ſometimes fewer Parts: and oft concluding at the end of his Accompt with <hi>&amp; caete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's:</hi> and confeſſing that one and the ſame man may act ſeveral Parts; as he that is a Souldier, may be a Husbandman and an Artificer, and in his fourth Book and fourth Chapter, he ſeems to reckon up eight Parts of a City, but in the Tail of them, he miſſes or forgets the ſixth. 1.

                  <p>That there may be more Parts of a Commonweal than are here numbred, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> confeſſeth or ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth; and of a Multitude of Parts, and of a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Mixtures of ſuch Parts may be made a World of Forms of <hi>Oligarchies</hi> and <hi>Democraties.</hi>

                  <p>This Confuſion of the Parts and Kinds of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweals drove <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> rather to reſt upon the Diviſion of <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>Poor,</hi> for the main parts of a Commonweal, than any other.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93433:67"/>
it fitter to allow all imaginable Forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that ſo he might not diſparage any one City, than to propound ſuch a Form as might condemn and deſtroy all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Though <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> allow ſo many ſeveral Forms of corrupted Governments; yet he inſiſts upon no one Form of all thoſe that he can define or deſcribe, in ſuch ſort, that he is able to ſay that any one City in all <hi>Greece</hi> was governed juſt according to ſuch a Form; his diligence is only to make as many Forms as the giddy or inconſtant Humour of a City could happen upon; he freely gives the People Liberty to invent as many Kinds of Government as they pleaſe, provided he may have Liberty to find fault with every one of them; it proved an eaſier Work for him to find Fault with every Form, than to tell how to amend any one of them; he found ſo many Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections in all ſorts of Commonweals, that he could not hold from reproving them before ever he tells us what a Commonweal is, or how many ſorts there are, and to this Purpoſe he ſpends his whole ſecond Book in ſetting out, and correcting the chief Commonweals of <hi>Greece,</hi> and among others the <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> the <hi>Cretan,</hi> and <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Commonweals; which three he eſteems to be much alike, and better than any other, yet he ſpares not to lay open their imperfections, and doth the like to the <hi>Athenian</hi>; wherein he breaks the Rule of Method, by delivering the Faults of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weals, before he teach us what a Commonweal is; for in his firſt Book, he ſpeaks only of the Parts, of which a City, or a Commonweal is made, but tells us not what a City or Commonweal is, until he come to his Third Book, and there in handling the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93433:68"/>
ſorts of Government, he obſerves no Method at all, but in a diſorderly way, flies backward and forward from one ſort to another: and howſoever there may be obſerved in him many Rules of <hi>Policy</hi> touching Government in general, yet without doubt where he comes to diſcourſe of particular Forms, he is full of Contradiction, or Confuſion, or both: it is true, he is brief and difficult, the beſt Right a man can do him, is to confeſs he underſtands him not; yet a diligent Reader may readily diſcern ſo many Irregularities and Breaches in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Books of <hi>Politicks,</hi> as tend to ſuch Diſtraction or Confuſion, that none of our new Politicians can make advantage of his Principles, for the Confirmation of <hi>an original Power by Nature in the People,</hi> which is the only Theme now in Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Diſcourſe is of ſuch Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weals as were founded by particular Perſons, as the <hi>Chalcedonian</hi> by <hi>Phaleas,</hi> the <hi>Mileſian</hi> by <hi>Hippodamas,</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> by <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> the <hi>Cretan</hi> by <hi>Minos,</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> by <hi>Solon,</hi> and the like: but the natural Right of the People to found, or elect their Kind of Government is not once diſputed by him: It ſeems the <hi>underived Majeſty of the People,</hi> was ſuch a Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical Piece of Speculation as our grand Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher was not acquainted with; he ſpeaks very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly of the Multitude in ſeveral Places, he affirms that the <hi>People are baſe or wicked Judges in their own Caſes,</hi>

                     <hi>Aristotle</hi> for the Incertainty, and Contrariety in him about the ſorts of Government, if we conſider him as a Heathen; for it is not poſſible for the Wit of man to ſearch out the firſt Grounds or Principles of Government, (which neceſſarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the original of Property) except he know that at the Creation one man alone was made, to whom the Dominion of all things was given, and from whom all men derive their Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. This Point can be learnt only from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: as for the imaginary Contract of People, it is a Fancy not improbable only, but impoſſible, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a <hi>multitude of men at first had sprung out,</hi>

This is a Point <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> diſputes not; nor ſo much as ever dreamt of an original Contract among People: he looked no farther in every City, then to a Scambling among the Citizens, whereby every one ſnatcht what he could get: ſo that a violent Poſſeſſion was the firſt, and beſt Title that he knew.</p>
                  <p>The main Diſtinction of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> touching perfect or Right Forms of Government from thoſe that are imperfect or corrupt, conſiſts ſolely in this Point, that where the profit of the governed is reſpected, there is a right Government, but where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Governours is regarded, there is a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption or Tranſgreſſion of Government.

Furthermore in all Aſſemblies, of what Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſoever they be, whether <hi>Ariſtocratical</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratical,</hi> as they call them, they all agree in this one Point, to give that honourable Regard to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, that they do interpret the major, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing part in every Aſſembly to be but as one man, and ſo do feign to themſelves a kind of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</p>
                  <p>Though there be neither Precept nor Practice in Scripture, nor yet any Reaſon alledged by <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> for any Form of Government, but only Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; yet it is ſaid that it is evident to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe, that of old time <hi>Rome,</hi> and in this preſent Age <hi>Venice,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a Form of Government different from Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy: Hereunto it may be anſwered, That a People may live together in Society, and help one another; and yet not be under any Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:93433:71"/>
as we ſee Herds of Cattel do, and yet we may not ſay they live under Government. For Government is not a Society only to live, but to live well and vertuouſly. This is acknowledged by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who teacheth that <note n="(a)" rend="inter">

                     <hi>the End of a City, is to live bleſſedly and honeſtly. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Communities are ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for honeſt Actions, but not for living together only.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now there be two things principally required to a bleſſed and honeſt life: <hi>Religion towards God,</hi> and <hi>Peace towards men:</hi> that is, <hi>a quiet and peaceable Life in all Godlineſs and Honeſty,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. Here then will be the Queſtion; Whether Godlineſs and Peace can be found under any Government but <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi> or whether <hi>Rome, Venice,</hi> or the <hi>Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries</hi> did enjoy theſe under any popular Government. In theſe two Points, let us firſt briefly examine the Roman Government, which is thought to have been the moſt glorious.</p>
                  <p>For Religion, we find preſently after the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the City by <hi>Romulus,</hi> the next King, <hi>Numa</hi> moſt devoutly eſtabliſhed a Religion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his Kingdom with the Service of the Gods; he forbad the Romans to make any Images of God, which Law laſted and was obſerved 170 Years, there being in all that time no Image or Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of God, in any Temple or Chappel of <hi>Rome</hi>; alſo he erected the Pontifical Colledge, and was himſelf the firſt Biſhop or <hi>Pontifex</hi>; Theſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:93433:72"/>
were to render no Account either to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate or Commonalty. They determined all Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning Religion, as well between Prieſts as between private men: They puniſhed inferiour Prieſts, if they either added or detracted from the eſtabliſhed Rites, or Ceremonies, or brought in any new thing into Religion. The chief Biſhop, <hi>Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fex Maximus,</hi> taught every man how to honour and ſerve the Gods. This Care had Monarchy of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p>But after the Expulſion of Kings, we do not find during the Power of the People, any one Law made for the Benefit or Exerciſe of Religion: there be two Tribunitian Laws concerning Religion, but they are meerly for the Benefit of the Power of the People, and not of Religion. <hi>L. Papirius,</hi> a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune, made a Law, called <hi>Lex Papiria,</hi> that it <hi>ſhould not belawful for any to conſecrate either Houſes, Grounds, Altars, or any other things without the Determination of the People. Domitius Aenobarbus</hi> another Tribune Enacted a Law called <hi>Domitia Lex,</hi> that the <hi>Pontifical Colledge ſhould not, as they were wont, admit whom they would into the Order of Prieſthood, but it ſhould be in the Power of the People</hi>; and becauſe it was contrary to their Religion, that Church-Dignities ſhould be beſtowed by the Common People; hence for very Shame he ordained, that the leſſer part of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, namely ſeventeen Tribes, ſhould elect whom they thought fit, and afterwards the Party elected ſhould have his Confirmation or Admiſſion from the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: Thus by a Committee of Seven Tribes taken out of Thirtyfive, the Ancient Form of Religion was altered and reduced to the Power of the leſſer part of the People. This was the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:93433:72"/>
great Care of the People to bring Ordination and Conſecration to the Laity.</p>
                  <p>The Religion in <hi>Venice,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> is ſufficiently known, much need not be ſaid of them: they admirably agree under a ſeeming contrariety; it is commonly ſaid, that one of them hath all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, and the other no Religion; the Atheiſt of <hi>Venice</hi> may ſhake hands with the Sectary of <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> This is the Liberty that a Popular Eſtate can brag of, every man may be of any Religion, or no Religion, if he pleaſe; their main Devotion is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed only in oppoſing and ſuppreſſing Monarchy. They both agree to exclude the Clergy from med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in Government, whereas in all Monarchies both before the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and under it, and ever ſince; all Barbarians, Graecians, Romans, Infidels, Turks, and Indians, have with one Conſent given ſuch Reſpect and Reverence to their Prieſts, as to truſt them with their Laws; and in this our Nation, the firſt Prieſts we read of before Chriſtianity, were the <hi>Druides,</hi> who, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſaith, <hi>decided and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined Controverſies, in Murder, in Caſe of Inheritance, of Bounds of Lands, as they in their Diſcretion judged meet; they grant Rewards and Puniſhments.</hi> It is a Wonder to ſee what high Reſpect even the great <hi>Turk</hi> giveth to his <hi>Mufti,</hi> or Chief Biſhop, ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is Religion to ſtrengthen and direct Laws.</p>
                  <p>To conſider of the Point of Peace: It is well known, that no People ever enjoyed it without Monarchy. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Lacedemonians pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved themſelves by Warring; and after they had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to themſelves the Empire, then were they preſently undone, for that they could not live at Rest, nor do any better Exerciſe, than the Exerciſe of War,</hi> lib. 2. c. 7.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:93433:73"/>
After <hi>Rome</hi> had expelled Kings, it was in perpetual War, till the time of the Emperours: once only was the Temple of <hi>Janus</hi> ſhut, after the end of the firſt <hi>Punick War,</hi> but not ſo long as for one year, but for ſome Months. It is true, as <hi>Oroſius</hi> ſaith, that <hi>for almoſt</hi> 700 <hi>years, that is, from</hi> Tullus Hoſtilius <hi>to</hi> Auguſtus Caeſar, <hi>only for one Summer, the Bowels of</hi> Rome <hi>did not ſweat Blood.</hi> On the Behalf of the <hi>Romans</hi> it may be ſaid, that though the Bowels of <hi>Rome</hi> did always ſweat Blood, yet they did obtain moſt glorious Victories abroad. But it may be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered, if all the <hi>Roman</hi> Conqueſts had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Foundation but Injuſtice; this alone foils all the Glory of her warlike Actions. The moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious War that ever <hi>Rome</hi> had, was with <hi>Carthage</hi>; the Beginning of which War, Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> proves to have been moſt unjuſtly undertaken by the <hi>Romans,</hi> in confederating with the <hi>Mamertines,</hi> and Aiding of Rebels, under the Title of protecting their Confederates; whereas Kings many times may have juſt Cauſe of War, for recovering and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Rights to ſuch Dominions as fall to them by Inheritance or Marriage, a Popular Eſtate, that can neither marry, nor be Heir to another, can have no ſuch Title to a War in a Foreign Kingdom; and to ſpeak the Truth, if it be rightly conſidered; the whole time of the Popularity of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> were no other than the only proſperous and glorious Thieves, and Robbers of the World.</p>
                  <p>If we look more narrowly into the Roman Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, it will appear, that in that very Age, wherein <hi>Rome</hi> was moſt victorious, and ſeemed to be moſt popular; ſhe owed moſt of her Glory to an apparent kind of <hi>Monarchy.</hi> For it was the Kingly
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:93433:73"/>
Power of the <hi>Conſuls, who</hi> (as <hi>Livy</hi> ſaith) <hi>had the ſame Royal Juriſdiction, or abſolute Power that the Kings had, not any whit diminiſhed or abated, and held all the ſame Regal Enſigns of ſupreme Dignity,</hi> which helpt <hi>Rome</hi> to all her Conqueſts: whiles the Tribunes of the People were ſtrugling at home with the Senate about Election of Magiſtrates, enacting of Laws, and calling to Account, or ſuch other po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Affairs, the Kingly Conſuls gained all the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories abroad: Thus <hi>Rome</hi> at one and the ſame time was broken and diſtracted into two Shews of Government; the Popular, which ſerved only to raiſe Seditions and Diſcords within the Walls, whilſt the Regal atchieved the Conqueſts of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Nations and Kingdoms. <hi>Rome</hi> was ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Benefit and Neceſſity of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> that in her moſt deſperate Condition and Danger, when all other Hopes failed her, ſhe had ſtill reſort to the Creation of a Dictator, who for the time was an Abſolute King; and from whom no Appeal to the People was granted, which is the royalleſt Evidence for <hi>Monarchy</hi> in the World; for they who were drawn to ſwear, they would ſuffer no King of <hi>Rome,</hi> found no ſecurity but in Perjury, and breaking their Oath by admitting the Kingly Power in ſpight of their Teeth, under a new name of a Dictator or Conſul: a juſt Reward for their wanton expelling their King for no other Crime they could pretend but Pride, which is moſt tolerable in a King of all men: and yet we find no particular Point of Pride charged upon him, but that he enjoyned the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> to labour in cleanſing, and caſting of Ditches, and paving their Sinks: an Act both for the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and Ornament of the City, and therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93433:74"/>
in the King: But the Citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> who had been Conquerours of all Nations round about them, could not endure of Warriers to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Quarriers, and Day-labourers. Whereas it is ſaid, that <hi>Tarquin</hi> was expelled for the Rape com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by his Son on <hi>Lucrece</hi>; it is unjuſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Father for the Crime of his Son; it had been fit to have petitioned the Father for the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the Offender: The Fact of young <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin</hi> cannot be excuſed, yet without wrong to the Reputation of ſo chaſte a Lady as <hi>Lucrece</hi> is reputed to be, it may be ſaid, ſhe had a greater Deſire to be thought chaſte, than to be chaſte; ſhe might have died untouched, and unſpotted in her Body, if ſhe had not been afraid to be ſlandered for Inchaſtity; both <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſeus,</hi> and <hi>Livie,</hi> who both are her Friends, ſo tell the Tale of her, as if ſhe had choſen rather to be a Whore, than to be thought a Whore. To ſay Truth, we find no other Cauſe of the Expulſion of <hi>Tarquin,</hi> than the Wantonneſs, and Licentiouſneſs of the People of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is further to be conſidered in the <hi>Roman</hi> Government, that all the time between their Kings, and their Emperours, there laſted a continued ſtrife, between the Nobility and Commons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by Degrees the Commons prevailed at laſt, ſo to weaken the Authority of the Conſuls and Senate, that even the laſt ſparks of <hi>Monarchy</hi> were in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner extinguiſhed, and then inſtantly began the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil War, which laſted till the Regal Power was quickly brought home, and ſetled in <hi>Monarchy.</hi> So long as the Power of the Senate ſtood good for the Election of Conſuls, the Regal Power was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93433:74"/>
in them, for the Senate had their firſt Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution from <hi>Monarchy:</hi> It is worth the noting, that in all thoſe places that have ſeemed to be moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular, that weak Degree of Government, that hath been exerciſed among them, hath been founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and been beholden unto <hi>Monarchical</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, both for the Power of aſſembling, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of conſulting: for the entire and groſs Body of any People, is ſuch an unweildy and diffuſed thing as is not capable of uniting, or congregating, or deliberating in an entire Lump, but in broken Parts, which at firſt were regulated by <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Furthermore it is obſervable, that <hi>Rome</hi> in her chief Popularity, was oft beholden for her Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to the Monarchical Power of the Father over the Children: by means of this Fatherly Power, ſaith <hi>Bodin,</hi> the Romans flouriſhed in all Honour and Vertue, and oftentimes was their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal thereby delivered from moſt imminent Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, when the Fathers drew out of the Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, their Sons being Tribunes publiſhing Laws tending to Sedition. Amongſt others <hi>Caſſius</hi> threw his Son headlong out of the Conſiſtory, publiſhing the Law <hi>Agraria</hi> (for the Diviſion of Lands) in the Behoof of the People, and after by his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Judgment put him to Death, the Magiſtrates, Serjeants, and People ſtanding thereat aſtonied, and not daring to withſtand his Fatherly Authority, although they would with all their Power have had that Law for Diviſion of Lands; which is ſufficient Proof, this Power of the Father not only to have been ſacred and inviolable, but alſo to have been lawful for him, either by Right or Wrong to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:93433:75"/>
diſpoſe of the Life and Death of his Children, even contrary to the Will of the Magiſtrates and People.</p>
                  <p>It is generally believed that the Government of <hi>Rome,</hi> after the Expulſion of Kings, was popular; <hi>Bodin</hi> endeavours to prove it, but I am not ſatisfied with his Arguments, and though it will be thought a Paradox, yet I muſt maintain, it was never truly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is difficult to agree, what a popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, it is where <hi>Many or a Multitude do rule</hi>; he doth not ſay where <hi>the People,</hi> or the <hi>major part of the People,</hi> or <hi>the Repreſentors of the People govern.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bodin</hi> affirms, <hi>if all the People be intereſſed in the Government, it is a Popular Estate,</hi> Lib. 2. c. 1. but after in the ſame Chapter he reſolves, that <hi>it is a Popular Estate, when all the People, or the greater part thereof hath the Sovereignty,</hi> and he puts the Caſe, that if there be threeſcore thouſand Citizens, and forty thouſand of them have the Sovereignty, and twenty thouſand be excluded, it ſhall be called a popular Eſtate: But I muſt tell him, though fifty nine thouſand, nine hundred, ninety nine of them govern, yet it is no popular Eſtate; for if but one man be excluded, the ſame reaſon that excludes that one man, may exclude many hundreds, and many thouſands, yea, and the major part it ſelf; if it be admitted, that the People are or ever were free by Nature, and not to be governed, but by their own Conſent, it is moſt unjuſt to exclude any one man from his Right in Government; and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the People ſo unnatural, as at the firſt to have
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93433:75"/>
all conſented to give away their Right to a major part, (as if they had Liberty given them only to give away, and not to uſe it themſelves) is not only improbable, but impoſſible; for the whole People is a thing ſo uncertain and changeable, that it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters every moment, ſo that it is neceſſary to ask of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Infant ſo ſoon as it is born its Conſent to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, if you will ever have the Conſent of the whole People.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, if the Arbitrary Tryal by a Jury of Twelve men, be a thing of that admirable Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Juſtice, as is commonly believed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Negative Voice</hi> of every ſingle Perſon is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, ſo that the diſſent of any of the Twelve fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates the whole Judgment: How much more ought the natural freedom of each man be preſerved, by allowing him his <hi>Negative Voice,</hi> which is but a continuing him in that Eſtate, wherein, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, Nature at firſt placed him? Juſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that no one Law ſhould bind all, except all conſent to it, there is nothing more violent and contrary to Nature, than to allow a major part, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other greater part leſs than the whole to bind all the People.</p>
                  <p>The next difficulty to diſcovering what a Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Eſtate is, is to find out where the Supreme Power in the <hi>Roman</hi> Government reſted; it is <hi>Bodin</hi>'s Opinion, that <hi>in the</hi> Roman <hi>State the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was in the Magiſtrates, the Authority and Council in the Senate, but the Sovereign Power and Majeſty in the People,</hi> Lib. 2. c. 1. So in his firſt Book his Doctrine is, that <hi>the ancient</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans <hi>ſaid, Imperium in Magiſtratibus, Authoritatem
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93433:76"/>
in Senatu, Poteſtatem in plebe, Majeſtatem in Populo jure eſſe dicebant.</hi> Theſe four words <hi>Command, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, Power,</hi> and <hi>Majeſty</hi> ſignifie ordinarily, one and the ſame thing, to wit, the Sovereignty, or ſupreme Power, I cannot find that <hi>Bodin</hi> knows how to diſtinguiſh them; for they were not diſtinct Faculties placed in ſeveral Subjects, but one and the ſame thing diverſly qualified, for <hi>Imperium, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas, Potestas,</hi> and <hi>Majeſtas</hi> were all originally in the Conſuls; although for the greater ſhew the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls would have the Opinion, and Conſent of the Senate who were never called together, nor had their Advice asked, but when and in what Points only it pleaſed the Conſuls to propound: ſo that properly <hi>Senatuſconſultum</hi> was only a Decree of the Conſuls, with the Advice of the Senators: And ſo likewiſe the Conſuls, when they had a mind to have the Countenance of an ampler Council, they aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the <hi>Centuries,</hi> who were reckoned as the whole People, and were never to be aſſembled, but when the Conſuls thought fit to propound ſome Buſineſs of great weight unto them; ſo that <hi>juſſus populi,</hi> the Command of the People which <hi>Bodin</hi> ſo much mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, was properly <hi>juſſus Conſulum,</hi> the Command of the Conſuls, by the Advice or Conſent of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Centuries, who were a Body compoſed of the Senators, and the reſt of the Patritians, Knights, and Gentlemen, or whole Nobility toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Commons: for the ſame men who had Voices in Senate, had alſo their Votes allowed in the Aſſembly of the Centuries, according to their ſeveral Capacities.</p>
                  <p>It may further appear, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93433:76"/>
was never truly popular, for that in her greateſt Show of Popularity, there were to be found above ten Servants for every Citizen or Freeman, and of thoſe Servants, not one of them was allowed any Place, or Voice in Government: If it be ſaid that the <hi>Roman</hi> Servants were Slaves taken in War, and therefore not fit to be Freemen; to this it may be anſwered, that if the Opinion of our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Politicians be good, which holds that <hi>all men are born Free by Nature,</hi> or if but the Opinion of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> be ſound, who ſaith that <hi>by Nature ſome men are Servants, and ſome are Masters,</hi> then it may be unnatural, or unjuſt to make all Priſoners in War Servants, or (as they are now called) <hi>Slaves,</hi> a Term not uſed in the Popular Governments, either of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Greece</hi>; for in both Languages, the uſual word that doth anſwer to our late Term of <hi>Slave,</hi> is but <hi>Servus</hi> in Latin, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in Greek. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if the Wars of the <hi>Romans,</hi> by which they gained ſo many Servants were unjuſt, as I take all offenſive War to be without a ſpecial Commiſſion from God, and as I believe all the Roman Wars were, that were made for the Enlargement of their Empire, then we may conclude, that the <hi>Romans</hi> were the notableſt Plagiaries, or Men-ſtealers in the World.</p>
                  <p>But to allow the leſſer part of the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> who called themſelves Citizens, to have had a juſt Right to exclude all Servants from being a part of the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> let us enquire whether the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part of thoſe, whom they allowed to be Citizens, had the Government of <hi>Rome</hi>; whereby we may diſcover eaſily how notoriouſly the poorer and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93433:77"/>
greater part of the Citizens were gull'd of their Share in Government; There were two famous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of their aſſembling the People of <hi>Rome</hi>: the firſt was by <hi>Claſſes,</hi> as they called them, which were divided into <hi>Centuries</hi>; the ſecond was by <hi>Tribes,</hi> or <hi>Wards</hi>; the former of theſe was a Ranking of the People, according to their Abilities or Wealth; the latter according to the Place or Ward, wherein every Citizen dwelt: In the Aſſemblies of neither of theſe, had the major part of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Power of Government, as may thus be made appear.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for the Aſſembly of the <hi>Centuries,</hi> there were ſix Degrees or <hi>Claſſes</hi> of men according to their Wealths; the firſt <hi>Claſſis</hi> was of the richeſt men in <hi>Rome,</hi> none whereof were under 200 <hi>l.</hi> in Value: The Valuation of the ſecond Claſſis was not under fourſcore Pounds; and ſo the third, the fourth, and the fifth Claſſis were each a Degree one under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The ſixth Claſſis contained the poorer ſort, and all the Rabble. Theſe ſix Claſſes were ſubdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Hundreds, or Centuries.</p>

                  <p>The Claſſes, and Centuries being thus ordered, when the Aſſembly came to give their Votes,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93433:77"/>
they did not give their Voices by the Poll, which is the true popular way: but each Century Voted by it ſelf, each Century having one Voice, the major part of the Centuries carried the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Now there being fourſcore and eighteen Centuries in the firſt Claſſis, in which all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricians, Senators, Noblemen, Knights, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of <hi>Rome,</hi> were inrolled, being more in Number, and above half the Centuries, muſt needs have the Government, if they agreed all together in their Votes, becauſe they Voted firſt, for when 97 Centuries had agreed in their Votes, the other Centuries of the inferiour Claſſis, were never called to Vote; thus the Nobles, and richer men who were but few in Compariſon of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People did bear the chief Sway, becauſe all the poorer ſort, or Proletarian Rabble, were clap'd into the ſixth Claſſis, which in reckoning were allowed but the ſingle Voice of one Century, which never came to Voting: whereas in Number they did far exceed all the five other Claſſes or Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and if they had been allowed the Liberty of other Citizens, they might have been juſtly num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred for a thouſand Centuries, or Voices in the Aſſembly; This Device of packing ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands into one Century, did exclude far the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the People from having a part in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                  <p>Next, for the Aſſembly of the People of <hi>Rome</hi> by Tribes, it muſt be conſidered, that the Tribes did not give their Voices by the Poll alltogether, which is the true way of popular Voting, but each Tribe or Ward did Vote by it ſelf, and the Votes of the major part (not of the People but) of the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:93433:78"/>
Tribes did ſway the Government, the Tribes being unequal, as all Diviſions by Wards uſually are, becauſe the Number of the People of one Tribe, is not juſt the ſame with the Number of the People of each other Tribe; whence it followed, that the major number of the Tribes might poſſibly be the minor Number of the People, which is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying of the Power of the major Part of the People.</p>
                  <p>Add hereunto, that the Nobility of <hi>Rome</hi> were excluded from being preſent at the Aſſembly of the Tribes; and ſo the moſt conſiderable part of the People was wanting, therefore it could not be the Voices of the major part of the People, where a great Part of the People were allowed no Voices at all, for it muſt be the major part of the whole, and not of a Part of the People, that muſt denominate a popular Government.</p>
                  <p>Moreover it muſt be noted, that the Aſſembly of the Tribes was not originally the Power of the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> for it was almoſt forty years after the Rejection of Kings before an Aſſembly of Tribes were thought on, or ſpoken of; for it was the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the People by Centuries, that agreed to the Expulſion of Kings, and creating of Conſuls in their Room, alſo the Famous Laws of the twelve Tables were ratified by the Aſſembly of the Centuries. This Aſſembly by Centuries, as it was more Ancient, than that by Tribes; ſo it was more truly popular, becauſe all the Nobility, as well as the Commons, had Voices in it: The Aſſembly by Tribes, was pretended at firſt, only to elect Tribunes of the People, and other inferiour Magiſtrates; to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of leſſer Crimes that were not Capital, but
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93433:78"/>
only finable; and to decree that Peace ſhould be made; but they did not meddle with denouncing War to be made, for that high Point did belong on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Aſſembly of the Centuries; and ſo alſo did the judging of Treaſon, and other Capital Crimes. The difference between the Aſſembly of the Tribes, and of the Centuries, is very material; for though it be commonly thought, that either of theſe two Aſſemblies were eſteemed to be the People, yet in Reality it was not ſo, for the Aſſembly of the Centuries only could be ſaid to be the People, becauſe all the Nobility were included in it as well as the Commons, whereas they were excluded out of the Aſſembly of the Tribes; and yet in Effect, the Aſſembly of the Centuries was but as the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the Lords, or Nobles only, becauſe the leſſer, and richer part of the People had the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, as the Aſſembly of the Tribes was, but the Commons only.</p>
                  <p>In maintenance of the popular Government of <hi>Rome, Bodin</hi> objects, that there could be no Regal Power in the two Conſuls, who could neither make Law, nor Peace, nor War. The Anſwer is, though there were two Conſuls, yet but one of them had the Regality; for they governed by Turns, one Conſul one Month, and the other Conſul ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Month; or the firſt one day, and the ſecond another day. That the Conſuls could make no Laws is falſe, it is plain by <hi>Livy,</hi> that they had the Power to make Laws, or War, and did execute that Power, though they were often hindered by the Tribunes of the People; not for that the Power of making Laws or War, was ever taken away from the Conſuls, or communicated to the Tribunes,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93433:79"/>
but only the Exerciſe of the Conſular Power was ſuſpended by a ſeeming humble way of <hi>interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the Tribunes; The Conſuls by their firſt Inſtitution had a lawful Right to do thoſe things, which yet they would not do by reaſon of the ſhortneſs of their Reigns, but choſe rather to countenance their Actions with the Title of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the Senate (who were their private Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil) yea, and ſometimes with the Decree of the Aſſembly of the Centuries (who were their Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Council) for both the Aſſembling of the Senate, and of the Centuries, was at the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Conſuls, and nothing was to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in either of them, but at the Will of the Conſuls: which argues a Sovereignty in them over the Senate and Centuries; the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> was like the Houſe of Lords, the Aſſembly of the Tribes reſembled the Houſe of Commons, but the Aſſembling of the <hi>Centuries,</hi> was a Body com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of Lords and Commons united to Vote toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>The Tribunes of the People bore all the Sway among the Tribes, they called them together when they pleaſed, without any Order, whereas the Centuries were never Aſſembled without Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and Religious Obſervation of the Birds by the Augurs, and by the Approbation of the Senate, and therefore were ſaid to be <hi>auſpicata,</hi> and <hi>ex authoritate Patrum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe things conſidered, it appears, that the Aſſembly of the Centuries was the only legitimate, and great Meeting of the People of <hi>Rome:</hi> as for any Aſſembling, or Electing of any Truſtees, or Repreſentors of the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> in nature of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:93433:79"/>
the Modern Parliaments, it was not in Uſe, or ever known in <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Above two hundred and twenty years after the Expulſion of Kings, a ſullen humour took the Commons of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they would needs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the City to <hi>Janiculum,</hi> on the other ſide of <hi>Tybur,</hi> they would not be brought back into the City, until a Law was made, That a <hi>Plebiſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> or a Decree of the Commons might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for a Law; this Law was made by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> to quiet the Sedition, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a part of the Legiſlative Power to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, in ſuch inferiour matters only, as by To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration and Uſurpation had been practiſed by the Commons. I find not that they deſired an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of the Points which were the Object of their Power, but of the Perſons, or Nobility that ſhould be ſubject to their Decrees: the great Power of making War, of creating the greater Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, of judging in Capital Crimes, remained in the Conſuls, with the Senate, and Aſſembly of the Centuries.</p>
                  <p>For further manifeſtation of the broken and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted Government of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is fit to conſider the Original Power of the Conſuls, and of the Tribunes of the Commons, who are ordinarily called the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes of the People.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is undeniable, that upon the expulſion of Kings, Kingly Power was not taken away, but only made Annual and changeable between two Conſuls; who in their Turns, and by courſe had the Sovereignty, and all Regal Power; this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears plainly in <hi>Livy,</hi> who tells us, that <hi>Valerius Publicola</hi> being Conſul, he himſelf alone ordained
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93433:80"/>
a Law, and then aſſembled a General Seſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Turentillus Arſa</hi> inveyed and complained againſt <hi>the Conſul's Government, as being ſo abſolute, and in Name only leſs odious than that of Kings, but in Fact more cruel; for inſtead of one Lord the City had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived twain, having Authority beyond all Meaſure, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited and infinite. Sextius</hi> and <hi>Licinus</hi> complain, that <hi>there would never be any indifferent Courſe, ſo long as the Nobles kept the Sovereign Place of Command, and the Sword to strike, whilſt the poor Commons have only the Buckler</hi>; their Concluſion was, that <hi>it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, that the Commons bear the Office of Conſuls too, for that were a Fortreſs of their Liberty; from that day forward, ſhall the Commons be Partakers of thoſe things, wherein the Nobles now ſurpaſs them, namely Sovereign Rule and Authority.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Law of the twelve Tribes affirm, <hi>Regio im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perio duo ſunto, iique Conſules appellantur.</hi> Let <hi>two have Regal Power, and let them be called Conſuls: alſo the</hi> Judgment of <hi>Livy</hi> is, that <hi>the Sovereign Power was tranſlated from Conſuls to Decemvirs, as before from Kings to Conſuls.</hi> Theſe are proofs ſufficient to ſhew the Royal Power of the Conſuls.</p>
                  <p>About ſixteen years after the firſt Creation of Conſuls, the Commons finding themſelves much run into Debt, by waſting their Eſtates in following the Wars; and ſo becoming, as they thought, oppreſſed by Uſury, and caſt into Priſon by the Judgment, and Sentence of the Conſuls, they grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly complained of Uſury, and of the Power of the Conſuls, and by Sedition prevailed, and obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Leave to chooſe among themſelves Magiſtrates called Tribunes of the People, who by their <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion</hi> might preſerve the Commons from being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:93433:80"/>
and ſuffering Wrong from the Conſuls: and it was further agreed, that the Perſons of thoſe Tribunes ſhould be ſacred, and not to be touched by any. By means of this Immunity of the Bodies of the Tribunes from all Arreſts or other Violence, they grew in time by Degrees to ſuch Boldneſs, that by ſtopping the Legal Proceedings of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls (when they pleaſed to intercede) they raiſed ſuch an Anarchy oft-times in Government, that they themſelves might act, and take upon them, what Power ſoever they pleaſed (though it belonged not to them.) This Gallantry of the Tribunes was the Cauſe, that the Commons of <hi>Rome,</hi> who were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Pretenders to Liberty, and the great Maſters of this part of Politicks, were thought the only fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Preſervers, and Keepers of the Liberty of <hi>Rome.</hi> And to do them right, it muſt be confeſſed, they were the only men that truly underſtood the Rights of a <hi>Negative Voice</hi>; if we will allow every man to be naturally free till they give their Conſent to be bound, we muſt allow every particular Perſon a Negative Voice; ſo that when as all have equal Power, and are as it were Fellow-Magiſtrates or Officers, each man may impeach, or ſtop his Fellow-Officers in their Proceedings, this is grounded upon the general Reaſon of all them, which have any thing in Common, where he which forbiddeth, or denieth, hath moſt Right; becauſe his Condition in that Caſe is better than his which commandeth, or moveth to proceed; for every Law or Command, is in it ſelf an Innovation, and a Diminution of ſome part of popular Liberty; for it is no Law ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it reſtrain Liberty; he that by his Negative Voice doth forbid or hinder the Proceeding of a new
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93433:81"/>
Law, doth but preſerve himſelf in that Condition of Liberty, wherein Nature hath placed him, and whereof he is in preſent Poſſeſſion; the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him thus in Poſſeſſion being the better, the ſtronger is his Prohibition, any ſingle man hath a juſter Title to his <hi>Negative Voice,</hi> than any Multitude can have to their Affirmative; to ſay the People are free, and not to be governed, but by their own Conſent, and yet to allow a major part to rule the whole, is a plain Contradiction, or a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of natural Freedom. This the Commons of <hi>Rome</hi> rightly underſtood, and therefore the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent Power of the Negative Voice of any one Tribune, being able of it ſelf to ſtay all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, not of the Conſuls and Senate only, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Magiſtrates, but alſo of the reſt of his Fellow-Tribunes, made them ſeem the powerfulleſt men in all <hi>Rome</hi>; and yet in Truth they had no Power or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction at all, nor were they any Magiſtrates, nor could they lawfully call any man before them, for they were not appointed for Adminiſtration of Juſtice, but only to oppoſe the Violence, and Abuſe of Magiſtrates, by interceding for ſuch as appealed, being unjuſtly oppreſſed; for which Purpoſe at firſt they ſate only without the Door of the Senate, and were not permitted to come within the Doors: this Negative Power of theirs was of force only to hinder, but not to help the Proceedings in Courts of Juſtice; to govern, and not to govern the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And though they had no Power to make Laws, yet they took upon them to propound Laws, and flattered and humoured the Commons by the <hi>Agrarian</hi> and <hi>Frumentarian</hi> Laws, by the firſt they divided the Common Fields, and conquered Lands
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93433:81"/>
among the Common People; and by the latter, they afforded them Corn at a cheaper or lower price: by theſe means theſe Demagogues or Tribunes of the Commons led the Vulgar by the Noſes, to allow whatſoever Uſurpations they pleaſed to make in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                  <p>The Royal Power of the Conſuls was never ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from them by any Law that I hear of, but continued in them all the time of their pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed popular Government, to the very laſt, though repined at, and oppoſed in ſome particulars by the Commons.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>No-Power,</hi> or <hi>Negative Power</hi> of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes, did not long give content to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and therefore they deſired, that one of the Conſuls might be choſen out of the Commonalty: the eager propounding of this Point for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and the diligent oppoſing of it by the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility or Senate, argues how much both Parties regarded the Sovereign Power of a Conſul; the Diſpute laſted fourſcore years within two: the Tribunes preſſing it upon all advantages of oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, never gave over till they carried it by ſtrong hand, or ſtubbornneſs, hindering all Elections of the <hi>Curule,</hi> or greater Magiſtrates, for five years together, whereby the Nobles were forced to yield the Commons a Conſul's Place, or elſe an <hi>Anarchy</hi> was ready to deſtroy them all, and yet the Nobility had for a good while allowed the Commons <hi>Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Tribunes with Conſular Power,</hi> which, in effect or ſubſtance, was all one with having one of the Conſuls a Commoner, ſo that it was the bare Name of a Conſul which the Commons ſo long ſtrived for with the Nobility: In this contention,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93433:82"/>
ſome Years Conſuls were choſen, ſome years <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> Tribunes in ſuch Confuſion, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtorians cannot agree among themſelves, what Conſuls to aſſign, or name for each Year, although they have <hi>Capitoline</hi> Tables, <hi>Sicilian</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters, and Kalenders, Fragments of <hi>Capitoline Marbles, linen Books or Records</hi> to help them: a good while the Commons were content with the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of having one of the Conſuls a Commoner; but about fourſcore years after they enjoyed this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, a Deſire took them to have it Enacted, that a Decree of the Commons called a <hi>Plebiſcitum</hi> might be obſerved for a Law, <hi>Hortenſius</hi> the Dictator yielded to enact it, thereby to bring back the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Commons, who departed to <hi>Janiculum</hi> on the other ſide of <hi>Tybur,</hi> becauſe they were deeply engaged in Debt in regard of long Seditions and Diſſenſions. The Eleventh Book of <hi>Livy,</hi> where this Sedition is ſet down, is loſt; we have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a touch of it in <hi>Florus</hi> his Epitome, and Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> mentions the Plundering of many Houſes by the Commons at their departing: this Sedition was above 220 years after the Expulſion of Kings, in all which time, the People of <hi>Rome</hi> got the Spoyl of almoſt all <hi>Italy,</hi> and the wealth of very many rich Cities: and yet the Commons were in ſo great Penury, and over-whelmed with Debts, that they fell to plunder the rich Houſes of the Citizens, which ſounds not much for the Honour of a popular Government. This communicating of a Legiſlative Power to the Commons, touching Power of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchiſing Allies, Judgments Penal, and Fines, and thoſe Ordinances that concerned the Good of the Commons called <hi>Plebiſcita,</hi> was a dividing
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93433:82"/>
of the Supreme Power, and the giving a Share of it to others, as well as to the Conſuls, and was in effect to deſtroy the Legiſlative Power, for to have two Supremes is to have none, becauſe the one may deſtroy the other, and is quite contrary to the indiviſible nature of Sovereignty. The Truth is, the Conſuls, having but annual Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, were glad for their own Safety, and Eaſe in Matters of great Importance, and Weight, to call together ſometimes the Senate, who were their ordinary Council, and many times the Centuries of the People, who were their Council extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, that by their Advice they might countenance, and ſtrengthen ſuch Actions as were full of Danger and Envy: and thus the Conſuls by weakening their Original Power brought the Government to Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Civil Diſſenſion, and utter Ruine: ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a thing it is to ſhew Favour to Common People, who interpret all Graces and Favours for their Rights, and juſt Liberties: the Conſuls fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Advice of the Senate or People, did not take away their Right of Governing no more than Kings loſe their Supremacy by taking Advice in Parliaments.</p>
                  <p>Not only the Conſuls, but alſo the Pretors and Cenſors (two great Offices, ordained only for the eaſe of the Conſuls, from whom an Appeal lay to the Conſuls) did in many things exerciſe an Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary or Legiſlative power in the Abſence of the Conſuls, they had no Laws to limit them: for many Years after the Creation of Conſuls, ten men were ſent into <hi>Greece</hi> to chooſe Laws; and after the twelve Tables were confirmed, whatſoever the Pretors, who were but the Conſuls Subſtitutes, did
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:93433:83"/>
command, was called <hi>jus honorarium</hi>; and they were wont at the Entrance into their Office to collect and hang up for Publick View, a Form of Adminiſtration of Juſtice which they would obſerve, and though the <hi>edictum Praetoris,</hi> expired with the Pretors Office, yet it was called <hi>Edictum perpetuum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What Peace the Low-Countries have found ſince their Revolt is viſible; it is near about an hundred Years ſince they ſet up for themſelves, of all which time only twelve years they had a Truce with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> yet in the next year, after the Truce was agreed upon, the War of <hi>Juliers</hi> brake forth, which engaged both Parties; ſo that upon the matter, they have lived in a continual War, for almoſt an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years; had it not been for the Aid of their Neighbours, they had been long ago ſwallowed up, when they were glad humbly to offer their new hatch'd Commonweal, and themſelves Vaſſals to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> after that the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third had refuſed to accept them as his Subjects; That little Truce they had, was almoſt as coſtly as a War; they being forced to keep about thirty thouſand Souldiers continually in Garriſon. Two things they ſay they firſt fought about, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Taxes, and they have prevailed it ſeems in both, for they have gotten all the Religions in Chriſtendom, and pay the greateſt Taxes in the World; they pay Tribute half in half for Food, and moſt neceſſary things, paying as much for Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute as the price of the thing ſold; Exciſe is paid by all Retailers of Wine, and other Commodities; for each Tun of Beer ſix Shillings, for each Cow for the Pail two Stivers every Week: for Oxen, Horſes, Sheep, and other Beaſts ſold in the Market
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93433:83"/>
the twelfth part at leaſt; be they never ſo oft ſold by the year to and fro, the new Maſter ſtill pays as much: they pay five Stivers for every Buſhel of their own Wheat, which they uſe to grind in Publick Mills: Theſe are the Fruits of the Low-Country War.</p>
                  <p>It will be ſaid that <hi>Venice</hi> is a Commonwealth that enjoys Peace. She indeed of all other States hath enjoyed of late the greateſt Peace; but ſhe owes it not to her kind of Government, but to the natural Situation of the City, having ſuch a Bank in the Sea of near threeſcore Miles, and ſuch Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes towards the Land, as make her unapproacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by Land, or Sea; to theſe ſhe is indebted for her Peace at home, and what Peace ſhe hath abroad ſhe buys at a dear Rate; and yet her Peace is little better than a continued War; The City always is in ſuch perpetual Fears, that many beſieged Cities are in more Security; a Senator or Gentleman dares not converſe with any Stranger in <hi>Venice,</hi> ſhuns Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, or dares not own it: they are no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Bandito's to all humane Society. Nay, no People in the World live in ſuch Jealouſie one of another; hence are their intricate Solemnities, or rather Lotteries in Election of their Magiſtrates, which in any other Place, would be ridiculous and uſeleſs. The Senators or Gentlemen are not only jealous of the Common People, whom they keep diſarmed, but of one another, they dare not truſt any of their own Citizens to be a Leader of their Army, but are forced to hire, and entertain Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Princes for their Generals, excepting their Citizens from their Wars, and hiring others in their Places; it cannot be ſaid, that People live
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:93433:84"/>
in Peace, which are in ſuch miſerable Fears con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> at firſt were ſubject to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour; and for fear of the Invaſion of the <hi>Hunnes</hi> forſook <hi>Padua,</hi> and other Places in <hi>Italy</hi>; and retired with all their Subſtance to thoſe Iſlands where now <hi>Venice</hi> ſtands: I do not read they had any Leave to deſert the defence of their Prince and Country, where they had got their Wealth, much leſs to ſet up a Government of their own; it was no better than a Rebellion, or Revolting from the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. At firſt they lived under a kind of <hi>Oligarchy</hi>; for ſeveral Iſlands had each a Tribune, who all met, and governed in common: but the dangerous Seditions of their Tribunes, put a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity upon them to chooſe a Duke for Life, who, for many hundreds of years, had an Abſolute Power; under whoſe Government <hi>Venice</hi> flouriſhed moſt, and got great Victories, and rich Poſſeſſions. But by inſenſible degrees, the Great Council of the Gentlemen have for many years been leſſening the Power of their Dukes, and have at laſt quite taken it away. It is a ſtrange Errour for any man to believe, that the Government of <hi>Venice</hi> hath been always the ſame that it is now: he that reads but the Hiſtory of <hi>Venice,</hi> may find for a long time a Sovereign Power in their Dukes: and that for theſe laſt two hundred years, ſince the diminiſhing of that Power, there have been no great Victories and Conqueſts ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by that Eſtate.</p>
                  <p>That which exceeds admiration, is, that <hi>Contarene</hi> hath the confidence to affirm the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Venice</hi> to be a mixed Form of <hi>Monarchy, Democraty,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtocraty:</hi> For, whereas he makes
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:93433:84"/>
the Duke to have the Perſon and Shew of a King; he after confeſſeth, that the Duke can do nothing at all alone, and being joyned with other Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, he hath no more Authority than any of them: alſo the Power of the Magiſtrates is ſo ſmall, that no one of them, how great ſoever he be, can determine of any thing of moment, without the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of the Council. So that this Duke is but a man dreſſed up in Purple, a King only in Pomp and Ornament, in Power but a Senator, within the City a Captive, without a Traytor, if he go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Leave. As little reaſon is there to think a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Eſtate is to be found in the great Council of <hi>Venice,</hi> or <hi>S. P. Q. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>.</hi> for it doth not conſiſt of the fortieth part of the People, but only of thoſe they call Patritians or Gentlemen; for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, neither by themſelves, nor by any choſen by them for their Repreſentors, are admitted to be any part of the Great Council: and if the Gentlemen of <hi>Venice</hi> have any Right to keep the Government in their own hands, and to exclude the Commons, they never had it given them by the People, but at firſt were beholding to <hi>Monarchy</hi> for their Nobility. This may further be noted, that though <hi>Venice</hi> of late enjoyed Peace abroad, yet it had been with that Charge, either for Fortification and Defence, or in Bribery ſo exceſſive, whereby of late upon any terms they purchaſed their Peace, that it is ſaid their Taxes are ſuch, that Chriſtians generally live better under the <hi>Turk,</hi> than under the <hi>Venetians,</hi> for there is not a grain of Corn, a ſpoonful of Wine, Salt, Eggs, Birds, Beaſts, Fowl, or Fiſh ſold, that pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not a certain Cuſtom: upon occaſions the Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and Crafts-men pay a Rate by the Poll monthly,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:93433:85"/>
they receive incredible Gains by Uſury of the Jews; for in every City they keep open Shops of Intereſt, taking Pawns after fifteen in the hundred, and if at the years end it be not redeemed, it is forfeited, or at the leaſt, ſold at great loſs. The Revenues which the very Courtezans pay for Toleration, maintains no leſs than a dozen of Gallies.</p>
                  <p>By what hath been ſaid, it may be judged how unagreeable the Popular Government of <hi>Rome</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, and of <hi>Venice,</hi> and the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces</hi> at preſent, are, either for Religion or Peace (which two are principal Ingredients of Government) and ſo conſequently not fit to be reckoned for Forms, ſince whatſoever is either good or tolerable in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their Governments, is borrowed or patch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up of a broken, and diſtracted <hi>Monarchy.</hi> Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though <hi>Venice</hi> and the <hi>Low Countries</hi> are the only remarkable Places in this Age that reject <hi>Monarchy</hi>; yet neither of them pretend their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to be founded upon any Original Right of the People, or have the Common People any Power amongſt them, or any choſen by them. Never was any Popular Eſtate in the World famous for keeping themſelves in peace; all their glory hath been for Quarrelling and Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that are willing to be perſwaded, that the Power of Government is originally in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, finding how impoſſible it is for any People to exerciſe ſuch Power, do ſurmiſe, that though the People cannot Govern, yet they may chooſe Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentors or Truſtees, that may manage this Power for the People, and ſuch Repreſentors muſt be ſurmiſed to be the People. And ſince ſuch Repreſentors can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:93433:85"/>
truly be choſen by the People, they are fain to divide the People into ſeveral Parts, as of Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Cities, and Burrough-Towns, and to allow to every one of thoſe Parts to chooſe one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentor or more of their own: and ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentors, though not any of them be choſen by the whole, or major part of the People, yet ſtill muſt be ſurmiſed to be the People; nay, though not one of them be choſen either by the People, or the major part of the People of any Province, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or Burrough, for which they ſerve, but only a ſmaller part, ſtill it muſt be ſaid to be the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Now when ſuch Repreſentors of the People do Aſſemble or meet, it is never ſeen that all of them can at one time meet together; and ſo there never appears a true, or full Repreſentation of the whole People of the Nation, the Repreſentors of one part or other being abſent, but ſtill they muſt be imagined to be the People. And when ſuch imperfect Aſſemblies be met, though not half be preſent, they proceed: and though their number be never ſo ſmall, yet it is ſo big, that in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of any buſineſs of moment, they know not how to handle it, without referring it to a fewer number than themſelves, though themſelves are not ſo many as they ſhould be. Thus thoſe that are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to repreſent the People, are neceſſitated to chooſe others, to repreſent the Repreſentors themſelves; a Truſtee of the North doth delegate his Power to a Truſtee of the South; and one of the Eaſt may ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute one of the Weſt for his Proxy: hereby it comes to paſs, that Publick Debates which are imagined to be referred to a General Aſſembly of a Kingdom, are contracted into a particular or private
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:93433:86"/>
Aſſembly, than which nothing can be more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive, or contrary to the nature of Publick Aſſemblies. Each Company of ſuch Truſtees hath a Prolocutor, or Speaker; who, by the help of three or four of his Fellows that are moſt active, may eaſily comply in gratifying one the other, ſo that each of them in their turns may ſway the Truſtees, whilſt one man, for himſelf or his Friend, may rule in one Buſineſs, and another man for himſelf or his Friend prevail in another cauſe, till ſuch a number of Truſtees be reduced to ſo many petty Monarchs as there be men of it. So in all Popularities, where a General Council, or great Aſſembly of the People meet, they find it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſpatch any great Action, either with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition or Secrecy, if a publick free Debate be admitted; and therefore are conſtrained to Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomize, and ſub-epitomize themſelves ſo long, till at laſt they crumble away into the Atomes of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> which is the next degree to <hi>Anarchy</hi>; for <hi>Anarchy</hi> is nothing elſe but a broken <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> where every man is his own <hi>Monarch,</hi> or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour.</p>
                  <p>Whereas the Power of the People in chooſing both their Government and Governours is of late highly magnified, as if they were able to chooſe the beſt and excellenteſt men for that purpoſe. We ſhall find it true what <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath affirmed, that <hi>to chooſe well is the office of him that hath Knowledge; none can chooſe a</hi> Geometrician <hi>but he that hath skill in</hi> Geometry, l. 3. c. 11. for, ſaith he, <hi>All men eſteem not Excellency to be one and the ſame,</hi> l. 3. c. 17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:93433:86"/>A great deal of talk there is in the World of the Freedom and Liberty that they ſay is to be found in Popular Commonweals; it is worth the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry how far, and in what ſence this Speech of Liberty is true. <hi>True Liberty is for every man to do what he list, or to live as he pleaſe, and not to be tied to any Laws.</hi> But ſuch Liberty is not to be found in any Commonweal; for there are more Laws in Popular Eſtates than any where elſe; and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently leſs Liberty: and Government many ſay was invented to take away Liberty, and not to give it to every man; ſuch Liberty cannot be; if it ſhould, there would be no Government at all: therefore <hi>Aristotle,</hi> lib. 6. cap. 4. <hi>It is profitable not to be lawful to do every thing that we will, for pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to do what one will, cannot reſtrain that Evil that is in every man</hi>; ſo that true Liberty cannot, nor ſhould not be in any Eſtate. But the only Liberty that the talkers of Liberty can mean, is a Liberty for ſome men to <hi>Rule and to be Ruled,</hi> for ſo <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> expounds it; one while to Govern, another while to be Governed; to be a King in the Forenoon, and a Subject in the Afternoon; this is the only Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty that a Popular Eſtate can brag of, that where a <hi>Monarchy</hi> hath but one King, their Government hath the Liberty to have many Kings by turns. If the Common People look for any other Liberty, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their Perſons or their Purſes, they are pitiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceived, for a perpetual Army and Taxes are the principal materials of all Popular Regiments: never yet any ſtood without them, and very ſeldom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with them; many Popular Eſtates have ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, but few have laſted; <hi>It is no hard matter for any kind of Government to last one, or two, or
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:93433:87"/>
three days,</hi> l. 6. c. 5. For all ſuch as out of hope of Liberty, attempt to erect new Forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he gives this prudent Leſſon. <hi>We must look well into the continuance of Time, and remembrance of many Years, wherein the means tending to eſtabliſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity had not lain hid, if they had been good and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; for almost all things have been found out, albeit ſome have not been received, and other ſome have been rejected, after men have had experience of them</hi>; L. 2. c. 5.</p>
                  <p>It is believed by many, that at the very firſt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling of the People, it was unanimouſly agreed in the firſt place, that the Conſent of the major part ſhould bind the whole; and that though this firſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement cannot poſſibly be proved, either how, or by whom it ſhould be made; yet it muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be believed or ſuppoſed, becauſe otherwiſe there could be no lawful Government at all. That there could be no lawful Government, except a General Conſent of the whole People be firſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, is no ſound Propoſition; yet true it is, that there could be no Popular Government without it. But if there were at firſt a Government without being beholden to the People for their Conſent, as all men confeſs there was, I find no reaſon but that there may be ſo ſtill, without asking Leave of the Multitude.</p>
                  <p>If it be true, that men are by nature free-born, and not to be governed without their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, and that Self-preſervation is to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the firſt place, it is not lawful for any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment but <hi>Self-Government</hi> to be in the World, it were ſin in the People to Deſire, or attempt to Conſent to any other Government: if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:93433:87"/>
will promiſe for themſelves to be Slaves, yet for their Children they cannot, who have always the ſame Right to ſet themſelves at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which their Fathers had to Enſlave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>To pretend that a major part, or the ſilent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of any part, may be interpreted to bind the whole People, is both unreaſonable and unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; it is againſt all Reaſon for men to bind o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, where it is againſt Nature for men to bind themſelves. Men that boaſt ſo much of natural Freedom, are not willing to conſider how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory and deſtructive the power of a major part is to the natural Liberty of the whole Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the two grand Favourites of the Subjects, <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> (for which moſt men pretend to ſtrive) are as contrary as Fire to Water, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand together. Though by Humane Laws in <hi>Voluntary Actions,</hi> a major part may be tolerated to bind the whole Multitude, yet in <hi>Neceſſary Actions,</hi> ſuch as thoſe of Nature are, it cannot be ſo. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if it were poſſible for the whole People to chooſe their Repreſentors, then either every, each one of theſe Repreſentors ought to be particularly choſen by the whole People, and not one Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentor by one part, and another Repreſentor by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other part of the People, or elſe it is neceſſary, that continually the entire Number of the Repreſentors be preſent, becauſe otherwiſe the whole People is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver repreſented.</p>
                  <p>Again, it is impoſſible for the People, though they might and would chooſe a Government, or Governours, ever to be able to do it: for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to ſpeak truly and properly, is a thing or Body
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:93433:88"/>
in continual Alteration and Change, it never conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues one Minute the ſame, being compoſed of a Multitude of Parts, whereof divers continually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay and periſh, and others renew and ſucceed in their places, they which are the People this Minute, are not the People the next Minute. If it be anſwered, that it is impoſſible to ſtand ſo ſtrictly, as to have the Conſent of the whole People; and therefore that which cannot be, muſt be ſuppoſed to be the Act of the whole People: This is a ſtrange Anſwer, firſt to affirm a Neceſſity of having the Peoples Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, then to confeſs an Impoſſibility of having it. If but once that Liberty, which is eſteemed ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, be broken, or taken away but from one of the meaneſt or baſeſt of all the People; a wide Gap is thereby opened for any Multitude whatſoever, that is able to call themſelves, or whomſoever they pleaſe, the People.</p>
                  <p>Howſoever men are naturally willing to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that all Sovereignty flows from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the People, and that without it no true Title can be made to any Supremacy; and that it is ſo <hi>currant an Axiom of late, that it will certainly paſs without Contradiction</hi> as a late <hi>Exercitator</hi> tells us: yet there are <hi>many and great Difficulties</hi> in the Point never yet determined, not ſo much as diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, all which the <hi>Exercitator</hi> waves and declines, profeſſing he will not inſiſt upon the Diſtinctions, touching <hi>the manner of the Peoples paſſing their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, nor determine which of them is ſufficient, and which not to make the Right or Title; whether it muſt be Antecedent to Poſſeſſion, or may be conſequent: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, or Tacite: Collective, or Repreſentative: Abſolute, or conditionated: Free, or Inforced: Revocable, or Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocable.</hi>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:93433:88"/>
All theſe are material Doubts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Peoples Title, and though the <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citator</hi> will not himſelf determine what conſent is ſufficient, and what not, to make a Right or Title, yet he might have been ſo courteous, as to have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected us, to whom we might go for Reſolution in theſe Caſes. But the Truth is, that amongſt all them that plead the Neceſſity of the Conſent of the People, none of them hath ever toucht upon theſe ſo neceſſary Doctrines; it is a Task it ſeems too difficult, otherwiſe ſurely it would not have been neglected, conſidering how neceſſary it is to reſolve the Conſcience, touching the manner of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples paſſing their Conſent; and what is ſufficient, and what not, to make, or derive a Right, or Title from the People.</p>
                  <p>No Multitude or great Aſſembly of any Nation, though they be all of them never ſo good and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, can poſſibly govern; this may be evidently diſcovered by conſidering the Actions of great and numerous Aſſemblies, how they are neceſſitated to relinquiſh that Supreme Power, which they think they exerciſe, and to delegate it to a few. There are two Parts of the Supreme Power, the <hi>Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> and the <hi>Executive,</hi> neither of theſe can a great Aſſembly truly act. If a new Law be to be made it may in the General receive the Propoſal of it from one or more of the General Aſſembly, but the forming, penning, or framing it into a Law, is committed to a few, becauſe a great number of Perſons cannot without tedious, and dilatory De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, examine the Benefits and Miſchiefs of a Law. Thus in the very firſt Beginning the Intention of a General Aſſembly is fruſtrated; then after a Law is
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93433:89"/>
penned or framed, when it comes to be queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether it ſhall paſs or nay; though it be Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a full Aſſembly, yet by the Rules of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, they are all ſo tied up, and barred from a free and full Debate; that when any man hath given the Reaſons of his Opinion; if thoſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be argued againſt, he is not permitted to reply in Juſtification or Explanation of them, but when he hath once ſpoken, he muſt be heard no more: which is a main Denial of that Freedom of Debate, for which the great Aſſembly is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be ordained in the high Point of <hi>Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Power.</p>
                  <p>The ſame may be ſaid, touching the <hi>Executive</hi> Power, if a cauſe be brought before a great Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, the firſt thing done, is to refer, or commit it to ſome few of the Aſſembly, who are truſted with the examining the Proofs, and Witneſſes, and to make Report to the General Aſſembly; who upon the Report proceed to give their Judgments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any publick hearing, or interrogating the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, upon whoſe Teſtimonies diligently exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned every man that will paſs a conſcientious Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to rely. Thus the <hi>Legiſlative</hi> and <hi>Executive</hi> Power are never truly practiſed in a great Aſſembly; the true Reaſon whereof is, if Freedom be given to Debate, never any thing could be agreed upon without endleſs Diſputes; meer Neceſſity compels to refer main Tranſactions of Buſineſs to particular Congregations and Committees.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Governments that ſeem to be popular are kinds of petty <hi>Monarchies,</hi> which may thus appear: Government is a Relation between the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and the governed, the one cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:93433:89"/>
the other, <hi>mutuò ſe ponunt &amp; auferunt</hi>; where a Command or Law proceeds from a major part, there thoſe individual Perſons that concurred in the Vote, are the Governours, becauſe the Law is only their Will in particular: the Power of a major Part being a contingent, or caſual thing, expires in the very Act it ſelf of Voting, which Power of a major Part is grounded upon a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that they are the ſtronger Part; when the Vote is paſt, theſe Votes, which are the major Part, return again, and are incorporated into the whole Aſſembly, and are buried as it were in that Lump, and no otherwiſe conſidered; the Act or Law ordained by ſuch a Vote, loſeth the Makers of it, before it comes to be obeyed; for when it comes to be put in Execution, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Will of thoſe who enjoyn it, and force Obedience to it, not by Virtue of any Power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the Makers of the Law. No man can ſay, that during the Reign of the late Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> that King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, or <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth did govern, although that many of the Laws that were made in thoſe two former Princes times, were obſerved, and executed under her Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; but thoſe Laws, though made by her Predeceſſours, yet became the Laws of her preſent Government; who willed and commanded the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of them, and had the ſame Power to correct, interpret, or mitigate them, which the firſt Makers of them had; every Law muſt always have ſome preſent known Perſon in Being, whoſe Will it muſt be to make it a Law for the Preſent; this cannot be ſaid of the major Part of any Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, becauſe that major part inſtantly ceaſeth, as
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:93433:90"/>
ſoon as ever it hath voted: an infallible Argument whereof is this, that the ſame major part after the Vote given, hath no Power to correct, alter, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate it, or to Cauſe it to be put in Execution; ſo that he that ſhall act, or cauſe that Law to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, makes himſelf the Commander, or willer of it, which was originally the Will of others: It is ſaid by Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> in his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> page 141. <hi>Nothing is Law, where the Legiſlator cannot be known, for there muſt be manifeſt Signs, that it proceedeth from the Will of the Sovereign; there is requiſite, not only a Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law, but alſo ſufficient Signs of the Author and the Authority.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Senate or great Council, wherein it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Supreme, or Legiſlative Power doth reſt, conſiſts of thoſe Perſons who are actually Subjects at the very ſame time, wherein they exerciſe their Legiſlative Power, and at the ſame inſtant may be guilty of breaking one Law, whilſt they are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king another Law; for it is not the whole and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Will of every particular Perſon in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, but that part only of his Will, which acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally falls out to concur with the Will of the greater part: So that the Sharers of the Legiſlative Power have each of them, perhaps not a hundredth part of the Legiſlative Power (which in it ſelf is indiviſible) and that not in <hi>Act,</hi> but in <hi>Poſſibility,</hi> only in one particular Point for that Moment, whilſt they give their Vote. To cloſe this Point which may ſeem ſtrange and new to ſome, I will produce the Judgment of <hi>Bodin,</hi> in his ſixth Book of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweal, and the fourth Chapter; his words are, <hi>The chief Point of a Commonweal, which is the Right of Sovereignty, cannot be, nor inſiſt, to speak properly,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:93433:90"/>
but in Monarchy; for none can be Sovereign in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweal, but one alone; if they be two, or three, or more, no one is Sovereign, for that no one of them can give or take a Law from his Companion: and although we imagine a Body of many Lords; or of a whole Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to hold the Sovereignty, yet hath it no true Ground nor Support, if there be not a Head with abſolute Power to unite them together, which a ſimple Magistrate without Sovereign Authority cannot do. And if it chance that the Lords, or Tribes of the People be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided (as it often falls out) then must they fall to Arms one againſt another: and although the greateſt part be of one Opinion, yet may it ſo happen, as the leſſer part, having many Legions, and making a Head, may oppoſe it ſelf againſt the greater Number, and get the Victory. We ſee the Difficulties which are, and always have been in popular Eſtates, whereas they hold contrary Parts, and for divers Magiſtrates, ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Peace, others War; ſome will have this Law, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that; ſome will have one Commander, others ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſome will treat a League with the King of</hi> France, <hi>others with the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>corrupted or drawn, ſome one Way, ſome another, making open War, as hath been ſeen in our Age amongst the Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>ALL thoſe who ſo eagerly ſtrive for an Original Power to be in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, do with one Conſent acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that Originally the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power was in the Fatherhood; and that the firſt Kings were Fathers of Families: This is not only evident, and affirmed by <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>; but yielded unto by <hi>Grotius,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> Mr. <hi>Aſcam</hi>; and all others of that Party, not one excepted, that I know of.</p>
                  <p>Now for thoſe that confeſs an original Subjection in Children, to be governed by their Parents, to dream of an original Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:93433:92"/>
in Mankind, is to contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and to make Subjects to be Free, and Kings to be Limited; to imagine ſuch Pactions and Contracts between Kings and People, as cannot be proved ever to have been made, or can ever be deſcribed or fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied, how it is poſſible for ſuch Contracts ever to have been, is a boldneſs to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> confeſſeth, that <hi>Adam, by dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God, was made the general Lord of all things, not without ſuch a private Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to himſelf, as (without his Grant) did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude his Children. And by Donation, or Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, or ſome kind of Conceſſion (before he was dead, or left any Heir to ſucceed him) his Children had their diſtinct Territories, by Right of Private Dominion.</hi> Abel <hi>had his Flocks, and Paſtures for them,</hi> Cain <hi>had his Fields for Corn, and the Land of</hi> Nod, <hi>where he built him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is confeſſed, that in the Infancy of the World, the Paternal Government was Monarchical; but when the World was repleniſhed with multitude of People, then the Paternal Government ceaſed, and was loſt; and an Elective kind of Government by the People, was brought into the World. To this it may be anſwered, That the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Power cannot be loſt; it may either
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:93433:92"/>
be <hi>transferr'd</hi> or uſurped; but never loſt, or ceaſeth. God, who is the giver of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, may transfer it from the Father to ſome other; he gave to <hi>Saul</hi> a Fatherly Power over his Father <hi>Kiſh,</hi> God alſo hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Father a Right or Liberty to alien his Power over his Children, to any other; whence we find the Sale and Gift of Children, to have been much in Uſe in the beginning of the World, when men had their Servants for a Poſſeſſion and an Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance as well as other Goods: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we find the Power of Caſtrating, and making Eunuchs much in Uſe in Old Times. As the Power of the Father may be lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly transferr'd or aliened, ſo it may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly uſurped: And in Uſurpation, the Title of an Uſurper is before, and better than the Title of any other than of him that had a former Right: for he hath a Poſſeſſion by the permiſſive Will of God, which Permiſſion, how long it may endure, no man ordinarily knows. Every man is to preſerve his own Life for the Service of God, and of his King or Father, and is ſo far to obey an Uſurper, as may tend not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the preſervation of his King and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but ſometimes even to the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Uſurper himſelf, when proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly he may thereby be reſerved to the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:93433:93"/>
or Mercy of his true Superiour; though by Humane Laws, a long Preſcription may take away Right, yet Divine Right never dies, nor can be loſt, or taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
                  <p>Every man that is born, is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Free-born, that by his very Birth he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Subject to him that begets him: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which Subjection he is always to live, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by immediate Appointment from God, or by the Grant or Death of his Father, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come poſſeſſed of that Power to which he was ſubject.</p>
                  <p>The Right of Fatherly Government was ordained by God, for the preſervation of Mankind; if it be uſurped, the Uſurper may be ſo far obeyed, as may tend to the preſervation of the Subjects, who may thereby be enabled to perform their Duty to their true and right Sovereign, when time ſhall ſerve: in ſuch Caſes to obey an Uſurper, is properly to obey the firſt and right Governour, who muſt be preſumed to deſire the ſafety of his Subjects: the Command of an Uſurper is not to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any thing tending to the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Perſon of the Governour; whoſe Being in the firſt place is to be looked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>It hath been ſaid, that there have been
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:93433:93"/>
ſo many Uſurpations by Conqueſt in all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, that all Kings are Uſurpers, or the Heirs or Succeſſors of Uſurpers; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any Uſurper, if he can but get the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of a Kingdom, hath as good a Title as any other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The firſt Uſurper hath the beſt Title, being, as was ſaid, in poſſeſſion by the Permiſſion of God; and where an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper hath continued ſo long, that the knowledge of the Right Heir be loſt by all the Subjects, in ſuch a Caſe an Uſurper in poſſeſſion is to be taken and reputed by ſuch Subjects for the true Heir, and is to be obeyed by them as their Father. As no man hath an infallible Certitude, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a moral Knowledge, which is no other than a probable perſwaſion grounded upon a peaceable poſſeſſion, which is a warrant for Subjection to Parents and Governours; for we may not ſay, becauſe Children have no infallible, or neceſſary certainty who are their true Parents, that therefore they need not obey, becauſe they are uncertain: it is ſufficient, and as much as Humane Nature is capable of, for Children to rely upon a credible perſwaſion; for otherwiſe the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Honour thy Father,</hi> would be a vain Commandment, and not poſſible to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:93433:94"/>By Humane poſitive Laws, a Poſſeſſion time out of mind takes away, or barrs a former Right, to avoid a general Miſchief, of bringing all Right into a Diſputation not decideable by proof, and conſequently to the overthrow of all Civil Government, in Grants, Gifts, and Contracts, between man and man: But in Grants and Gifts that have their Original from God or Nature, as the Power of the Father hath, no Inferiour Power of man can limit, nor make any Law of Preſcription againſt them: upon this ground is built that Common Maxim, that <hi>Nullum tempus occurrit regi,</hi> No time bars a King.</p>
                  <p>All Power on Earth is either <hi>derived</hi> or <hi>uſurped</hi> from the Fatherly Power, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other Original to be found of any Power whatſoever; for if there ſhould be granted two ſorts of Power without any Subordination of one to the other, they would be in perpetual ſtrife which ſhould be Supreme, for two Supremes cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; if the Fatherly Power be Supreme, then the Power of the People muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate, and depend on it; if the Power of the People be Supreme, then the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Power muſt ſubmit to it, and cannot be exerciſed without the Licence of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which muſt quite deſtroy the Frame
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:93433:94"/>
and courſe of Nature. Even the Power which God himſelf exerciſeth over Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is by Right of Fatherhood; he is both the King and Father of us all; as God hath exalted the Dignity of Earthly Kings, by communicating to them his own Title, by ſaying <hi>they are gods</hi>; ſo on the other ſide, he hath been pleaſed as it were to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelf, by aſſuming the Title of a King to expreſs his Power, and not the Title of any popular Government; we find it is a puniſhment to have <hi>no King,</hi> Hoſea, <hi>ch.</hi> 3.4. and promiſed, as a Bleſſing to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> Gen. 17.6. <hi>that Kings ſhall come out of thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every man hath a part or ſhare in the preſervation of Mankind in General, he that uſurps the Power of a Superiour, thereby puts upon himſelf a Neceſſity of acting the Duty of a Superiour in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of them over whom he hath uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unleſs he will aggravate one heinous Crime, by committing another more hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid; he that takes upon him the Power of a Superiour ſins ſufficiently, and to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: but he that proceeds to deſtroy both his Superiour, and thoſe under the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Protection, goeth a Strain higher, by adding Murther to Robbery; if Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be hindered, mankind periſheth, an
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:93433:95"/>
Uſurper by hindering the Government of another, brings a Neceſſity upon himſelf to govern, his Duty before Uſurpation was only to be miniſterial, or inſtrumental in the preſervation of others by his Obedience; but when he denies his own, and hinders the Obedience of others, he doth not only not help, but is the Cauſe of the Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in hindering his Superiour to perform his Duty, he makes the Duty his own: if a Superiour cannot protract, it is his part to deſire to be able to do it, which he cannot do in the Future if in the preſent they be deſtroyed for want of Government: therefore it is to be preſumed, that the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour deſires the preſervation of them that ſhould be ſubject to him; and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it may be preſumed, that an Uſurper in general doth the Will of his Superiour, by preſerving the People by Government, and it is not improper to ſay, that in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Uſurper, we may obey primarily the true Superiour, ſo long as our Obedience aims at the preſervation of thoſe in Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not at the Deſtruction of the true Governour. Not only the Uſurper, but thoſe alſo over whom Power is uſurped, may joyn in the preſervation of themſelves, yea, and in the preſervation ſometimes of the Uſurper himſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:93433:95"/>Thus there may be a conditional Duty, or Right in an Uſurper to govern; that is to ſay, ſuppoſing him to be ſo wicked as to uſurp, and not willing to ſurrender or forgo his Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he is then bound to protect by Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or elſe he encreaſeth, and multiplieth his Sin.</p>
                  <p>Though an Uſurper can never gain a Right from the true Superiour, yet from thoſe that are Subjects he may; for if they know no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that hath a better Title than the Uſurper, then as to them the Uſurper in Poſſeſſion hath a true Right.</p>
                  <p>Such a qualified Right is found at firſt in all Uſurpers, as is in Thieves who have ſtolen Goods, and during the time they are poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of them, have a Title in Law againſt all others but the true Owners, and ſuch Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers to divers Intents and Purpoſes may be obeyed.</p>
                  <p>Neither is he only an Uſurper who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Government, but all they are Partakers in the Uſurpation, who have either failed to give Aſſiſtance to their lawful Sovereign, or have given Aid ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by their Perſons, Eſtates or Counſels for the Deſtroying of that Governour, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe Protection they have been born and preſerved; for although it ſhould be granted, that <hi>Protection</hi> and <hi>Subjection</hi> are
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:93433:96"/>
reciprocal, ſo that where the firſt fails, the latter ceaſeth; yet it muſt be remembred, that where a man hath been born under the Protection of a long and peaceable Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, he owes an Aſſiſtance for the preſervation of that Government that hath protected him, and is the Author of his own Diſobedience.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid by ſome, that an uſurped Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er may be obeyed in things that are lawful: but it may not be obeyed not only in lawful things, but alſo in things indifferent: Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in things indifferent, is neceſſary; not indifferent. For in things neceſſarily good God is immediately obeyed, Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours only by Conſequence: If men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand things evil, Obedience is due only by <hi>tolerating</hi> what they inflict: not by <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming</hi> what they require: in the firſt they declare what God commands to be <hi>done,</hi> in the latter what to be <hi>ſuffered,</hi> ſo it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, that things indifferent only are the proper Object of Humane Laws. Actions are to be conſidered <hi>ſimply</hi> and alone, and ſo are good as being Motions depending on the firſt Mover; or <hi>joyntly</hi> with Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances: And that in a double Manner. 1. In Regard of the <hi>Ability</hi> or <hi>Poſſibility</hi> whileſt they may be done. 2. In the <hi>Act</hi> when they be performed: Before they be
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:93433:96"/>
done they be indifferent; but once breaking out into Act, they become diſtinctly Good or Evil according to the Circumſtances which determine the ſame. Now an Action com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, is ſuppoſed as not yet done (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Hebrews call the Imperative Mood the firſt Future) and ſo remaineth many times indifferent.</p>
                  <p>Some may be of Opinion, that if Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience may be given to an Uſurper in things indifferent, as well as to a lawful Power; that then there is as much Obedience due to an uſurped Power, as to a lawful. But it is a Miſtake; for though it be granted that in things indifferent, an Uſurper may be obeyed, as well as a lawful Governour; yet herein lieth a main Difference, that ſome things are indifferent for a lawful Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, which are not indifferent, but unlawful to an Uſurper to enjoyn. Uſurpation is the reſiſting, and taking away the Power from him, who hath ſuch a former Right to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Uſurper, as cannot be lawfully taken away: ſo that it cannot be juſt for an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper, to take Advantage of his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Act, or create himſelf a Title by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of his own Injuſtice, which ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravates, and never extenuates his Crime: and if it never can be an Act indifferent for the Uſurper himſelf to diſobey his Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:93433:97"/>
Sovereign, much leſs can it be indifferent for him to command another to do that to which he hath no Right himſelf. It is only then a matter indifferent for an Uſurper to command, when the Actions enjoyned are ſuch; as the lawful Superiour is commanded by the Law of God, to provide for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of his Subjects, by the ſame, or other like Reſtriction of ſuch indifferent things; and it is to be preſumed, if he had not been hindered, would have commanded the ſame, or the like Laws.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>WITH no ſmall Content I read Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi>'s Book <hi>De Cive,</hi> and his <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan,</hi> about the Rights of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, which no man, that I know, hath ſo amply and judiciouſly handled: I conſent with him about the Rights of <hi>exerciſing</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but I cannot agree to his means of <hi>acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> it. It may ſeem ſtrange I ſhould praiſe his Building, and yet miſlike his Foundation; but ſo it is, his <hi>Jus Naturae,</hi> and his <hi>Regnum In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutivum,</hi> will not down with me: they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear full of Contradiction and Impoſſibilities; a few ſhort Notes about them, I here offer, wiſhing he would conſider, whether his Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would not ſtand firmer upon the Principles of <hi>Regnum Patrimoniale</hi> (as he calls it) both according to <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Since he confeſſeth the <hi>Father, being before the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Commonwealth, was Originally an Abſolute Sovereign, with Power of Life
<pb facs="tcp:93433:99"/>
and Death,</hi> and that <hi>a great Family, as to the Rights of Sovereignty, is a little Monarchy.</hi> If, according to the order of Nature, he had bandled <hi>Paternal Government</hi> before that by <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> there would have been little Liberty left in the Subjects of the Family to conſent to Inſtitution of Government.</p>
                  <p>In his pleading the Cauſe of the People, he arms them with a very large Commiſſion of <hi>Array;</hi> which is, a Right in Nature for every Man, to war againſt every Man when he pleaſe: and alſo a Right for all the People to govern. This latter Point, although he affirm in Words, yet by Conſequence he denies, as to me it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith, a <hi>Repreſentative</hi> may be of <hi>All,</hi> or but of a <hi>Part</hi> of the People. If it be of <hi>All,</hi> he terms it a <hi>Democraty,</hi> which is the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the People. But how can ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth be generated? for if every man Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with every man, who ſhall be left to be the <hi>Repreſentative?</hi> if <hi>All</hi> muſt be <hi>Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> who will remain to Covenant? for he that is Sovereign makes no Covenant by his Doctrine. It is not <hi>All that will come together,</hi> that makes the <hi>Democraty,</hi> but <hi>All that have Power</hi> by Covenant; thus his <hi>Democraty</hi> by <hi>Inſtitution</hi> fails.</p>
                  <p>The ſame may be ſaid of a <hi>Democraty by Acquiſition;</hi> for if all be <hi>Conquerours,</hi> who
<pb facs="tcp:93433:99"/>
ſhall Covenant for Life and Liberty? and if all be not Conquerours, how can it be a <hi>Democraty</hi> by Conqueſt?</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Paternal Democraty</hi> I am confident he will not affirm; ſo that in concluſion the poor People are deprived of their Government, if there can be no <hi>Democraty,</hi> by his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
                  <p>Next, If a <hi>Repreſentative Ariſtocratical</hi> of a Part of the People be free from Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then that whole Aſſembly (call it what you will) though it be never ſo great, is in the ſtate of Nature, and every one of that Aſſembly hath a Right not only to kill any of the Subjects that they meet with in the Streets, but alſo they all have a Natural Right to cut one anothers throats, even while they ſit together in Council, by his Principles. In this miſerable condition of War is his <hi>Repreſentative Ariſtocratical</hi> by Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Commonwealth by Conqueſt,</hi> he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, is then <hi>acquired,</hi> when the Vanquiſhed, to avoid preſent Death, Covenanteth, that ſo long as his Life, and the liberty of his Body is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, the Victor ſhall have the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of it at his pleaſure. Here I would know how the Liberty of the Vanquiſhed can be allowed, if the Victor have the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of it at pleaſure, or how it is poſſible for the Victor to perform his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, except he could always ſtand by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb facs="tcp:93433:100"/>
particular man to protect his Life and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty?</p>
                  <p>In his Review and Concluſion he reſolves, that an ordinary Subject hath liberty to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, when the means of his Life is within the Guards and Gariſons of the Enemy. It ſeems hereby that the Rights of Sovereignty by Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be forfeited, for the Subject cannot be at liberty to ſubmit to a Conquerour, except his former Subjection be forfeited for want of Protection.</p>
                  <p>If his Conquerour be in the State of Nature when he conquers, he hath a Right without any Covenant made with the conquered: If Conquest be defined to be the <hi>acquiring of Right of Sovereignty by Victory,</hi> why is it ſaid, <hi>the Right is acquired in the Peoples Submiſſion, by which they contract with the Victor, Promiſing Obedience for Life and Liberty?</hi> hath not every one in the ſtate of Nature a Right to Sovereignty before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, which only puts him in poſſeſſion of his Right?</p>
                  <p>If his Conquerour be not in the ſtate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but a Subject by Covenant, how can he get a Right of Sovereignty by Conquest, when nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he himſelf hath Right to Conquer, nor Subjects a liberty to Submit? ſince a former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract lawfully made, cannot lawfully be broken by them.</p>

                     <p>IF God created only <hi>Adam,</hi> and of a Piece of him made the Woman; and if by Generation from them two, as Parts of them, all Mankind be propagated: If alſo God gave to <hi>Adam</hi> not only the Dominion over the Woman and the Children that ſhould iſſue from them, but alſo over the whole Earth to ſubdue it, and over all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures on it, ſo that as long as <hi>Adam</hi> lived no man could claim or enjoy any thing but by Donation, Aſſignation, or Permiſſion from him; I wonder how the <hi>Right of Nature</hi> can be imagined by Mr. <hi>Hobs,</hi> which he ſaith, <hi>pag.</hi> 64. is, <hi>a Liberty for each man to uſe his own Power as he will himſelf for Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his own Life: a Condition of War of every one againſt every one, a Right of every man to every thing,

                     <p>I cannot underſtand how this <hi>Right of Nature</hi> can be conceived without imagining a Company of men at the very firſt to have been all Created together without any Dependency one of another, or as <hi>Muſhroms (fungorum more) they all on a ſudden were ſprung out of the Earth without any Obligation one to another,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi>'s words are in his Book <hi>De Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve, cap.</hi> 8. <hi>ſect.</hi> 3. the Scripture teacheth us other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that all men came by Succeſſion, and Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from one man: We muſt not deny the Truth of the Hiſtory of the Creation.</p>

                     <p>It is not to be thought that God would create man in a Condition worſe than any Beaſts, as if he made men to no other End by Nature but to deſtroy

                        </note> This horrid Condition of pure Nature when Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> was charged with, his Refuge was to Anſwer, <hi>that no Son can be underſtood to be in this ſtate of pure Nature:</hi> which is all one with deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own Principle, for if men be not free-born, it is not poſſible for him to aſſign and prove any other time for them to claim a Right of Nature to Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if not at their Birth.</p>

                     <p>But if it be allowed (which is yet moſt falſe) that a Company of men were at firſt without a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Power to keep them in Awe; I do not ſee why ſuch a Condition muſt be called <hi>a State of War of all men againſt all men</hi>: Indeed if ſuch a Multitude of men ſhould be created as the Earth could not well nouriſh, there might be Cauſe for men to deſtroy one another rather than periſh for want of Food; but God was no ſuch Niggard in the Creation, and there being Plenty of Suſtenance and Room for all men, there is no Cauſe or Uſe of War till men be hindered in the Preſervation of Life, ſo that there is no abſolute Neceſſity of War in the State of pure Nature; it is the Right of Nature for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man to live in Peace, that ſo he may tend the Preſervation of his Life, which whileſt he is in actual War he cannot do. War of it ſelf as it is War preſerves no mans Life, it only helps us to preſerve and obtain the Means to live: if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man tend the Right of preſerving Life, which

                     <p>But admit the State of Nature were the State of War; let us ſee what Help Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> hath for it. It is a Principle of his, that <hi>the Law of Nature is a Rule found out by Reaſon,</hi> (I do think it is given by God) <hi>pag.</hi> 64. <hi>forbidding a man to do that which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to his Life, and to omit that by which he thinks it may be beſt preſerved:</hi> If the Right of Nature be a Liberty for a man to do any thing he thinks fit to preſerve his Life, then in the firſt Place Nature muſt teach him that Life is to be preſerved, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently forbids to do that which may deſtroy or take away the means of Life, or to omit that by which it may be preſerved: and thus the <hi>Right of Nature</hi> and <hi>the Law of Nature</hi> will be all one: for I think Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> will not ſay the Right of Nature is a Liberty for man to deſtroy his own Life. The Law of Nature might better have been ſaid to conſiſt in a Command to preſerve or not to omit the Means of preſerving Life, than in a Prohibition to deſtroy, or to omit it.</p>

                     <p>Pag. 87. <hi>The only way to erect a Common Power or a Commonwealth; is for men to confer all their Power and Strength upon one man, or one Aſſembly of men, that may reduce all their Wills by Plurality of Voices to one Will; which is to appoint one man or an Aſſembly of men to bear their Perſon, to ſubmit their Wills to his Will: this is a real <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of them all in one Perſon, made by Covenant of every man with every man, as if every man ſhould ſay to every man, I authorize, and give up my Right of Governing my ſelf to this man, or this Aſſembly of men, on this Condition, that thou give up thy Right to him, and authorize all his Actions. This done, the Multitude ſo united in one Perſon, is called a Commonwealth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To authorize and give up his Right of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, to confer all his Power and Strength, and to ſubmit his Will to another, is to lay down his Right of reſiſting: for if Right of Nature be a Liberty to uſe Power for Preſervation of Life, laying down of that Power muſt be a relinquiſhing of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:93433:104"/>
to preſerve or defend Life, otherwiſe a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſheth nothing.</p>
                     <p>To reduce all the Wills of an Aſſembly by Plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Voices to one Will, is not a proper Speech, for it is not a Plurality but a Totality of Voices which makes an Aſſembly be of one Will, otherwiſe it is but the one Will of a major part of the Aſſembly, the Negative Voice of any one hinders the Being of the one Will of the Aſſembly, there is nothing more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the true Nature of a lawful Aſſembly, than to allow a major part to prevail when the whole only hath Right. For a man to give up his Right to one that never Covenants to protect, is a great Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſince it is neither <hi>in Conſideration of ſome Right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally transferred to himſelf, nor can he hope for any other Good, by ſtanding out of the way, that the other may enjoy his own Original Right, without hinderance from him by reaſon of ſo much Diminution of Impediments, pag.</hi> 66.</p>

                     <p>The Liberty, <hi>ſaith Mr.</hi> Hobs, whereof there is ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and honourable mention in the Hiſtories and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy of the Ancient Greeks and Romans, and in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings &amp; Diſcourſe of thoſe that from them have received all their Learning in the Politicks, is not the Liberty of particular men, but the Liberty of the Commonwealth.

This may be confirmed by the Complaint of our Authour, which followeth:</hi> It is an eaſie thing for men to be deceived by the ſpecious name of Liberty: and for want of Judgment to distinguiſh, miſtake that for their private Inheritance or Birthright, which is the Right of the Publick only: And when the ſame Errour is confirmed by the Authority of men in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation for their Writings on this Subject, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if it produce Sedition and Change of Government. In the Weſtern Parts of the World, we are made to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our Opinions concerning the Inſtitution and Right of Commonwealths from <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> and other men, Greeks and Romans; that living under Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Eſtates, derived thoſe Rights not from the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Nature, but tranſcribed them into their Books out of the Practice of their own Commonwealths, which were Popular. <hi>And</hi> becauſe the Athenians were taught (to keep them from Deſire of changing their Government) that they were Free-men, and all that lived under Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, Slaves: therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> puts it down in his Politicks. In Democracy Liberty is to be ſuppoſed, for it's commonly held that no man is free in any other Government. So <hi>Cicero</hi> and other Writers grounded their Civil Doctrine on the Opinions of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who were taught to hate Monarchy, at firſt, by them

that having depoſed their Sovereign, ſhared amongſt them the Sovereignty of <hi>Rome.</hi> And by reading of theſe <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Authors, Men from their Childhood have gotten a Habit (under a falſe ſhew of Liberty) of favouring Tumults, and of licentious controuling the Actions of their Sovereigns.</p>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> ſaith, pag. 112. <hi>No man is bound by the words themſelves of his Submiſſion to kill himſelf, or any other man, and conſequently that the Obligation a man may ſometimes have upon the Command of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:93433:106"/>
to execute any dangerous or diſhonourable Office, dependeth not on the words of our Submiſſion, but on the Intention, which is to be underſtood by the End thereof. When therefore our refuſal to Obey fruſtrates the End for which the Sovereignty was Ordained, then there is no liberty to refuſe: otherwiſe there is.</hi> If no man be bound by the words of his Subjection to kill any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, then a Sovereign may be denied the benefit of War, and be rendred unable to defend his People, and ſo the End of Government fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> puts a caſe by way of Queſtion. <hi>A great many men together have already reſiſted the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Power unjuſtly, or committed ſome Capital Crime, for which every one of them expecteth death: whether have they not the liberty then to joyn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and aſſiſt and defend one another? Certainly they have; for they but defend their Lives, which the Guilty man may as well do as the Innocent: There was indeed Injuſtice in the firſt breach of their Duty, their bearing of Arms ſubſequent to it, though it be to maintain what they have done, is no new unjuſt Act; and if it be only to defend their Perſons, it is not unjuſt at all.</hi> The only reaſon here alledged for the Bearing of Arms, is this; That there is no new unjuſt Act: as if the beginning only of a Rebellion were an unjuſt. Act, and the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of it none at all. No better Anſwer can be given to this caſe, than what the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath delivered in the beginning of the ſame Paragraph, in theſe words; <hi>To reſiſt the Sword of the Commonwealth in defence of another man, Guilty or Innocent, no man hath Liberty: becauſe ſuch Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty takes away from the Sovereign the Means of protecting us, and is therefore deſtructive of the very Eſſence of Government.</hi> Thus he firſt anſwers the queſtion, and then afterwards makes it, and gives it a contrary Anſwer: other Paſſages I meet with to the like purpoſe. He ſaith, Page 66. <hi>A man cannot lay down the Right of Reſiſting them that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault him by Force to take away his Life: The ſame may be ſaid of Wounds, Chains, and Impriſonment.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>The Kingdom of God ſignifies,</hi> (ſaith Maſter <hi>Hobs,</hi> page 216.) <hi>a Kingdom conſtituted by the Votes of the People of</hi> Iſrael <hi>in a peculiar manner, wherein they chooſe God for their King, by Covenant made with him, upon God's promiſing them</hi> Canaan. If we look upon Maſter <hi>Hobs</hi>'s Text for this, it will be found that the People did not Conſtitute by Votes, and chooſe God for their King; But by the Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment firſt of God himſelf, the Covenant was to be a God to them: they did not contract with God, that if he would give them <hi>Canaan,</hi> they would be his Subjects, and he ſhould be their King; It was not in their power to chooſe whether God ſhould be their God, yea, or nay: for it is confeſſed, <hi>He reigned naturally over all by his Might.</hi> If God Reigned naturally, he had a Kingdom,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:93433:108"/>
and Sovereign Power over his Subjects, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by their own Conſent. This Kingdom, ſaid to be conſtituted by the Votes of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is but the Vote of <hi>Abraham</hi> only; his ſingle Voice carried it; he was the Repreſentative of the People. For at this Vote, it is confeſſed, that the Name of <hi>King</hi> is not given to God, nor of <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi>; yet the thing, if we will believe Maſter <hi>Hobs,</hi> is all one. If a Contract be the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual transferring of Right, I would know what Right a People can have to transfer to God by Contract. Had the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> a Right not to obey God's Voice? If they had not ſuch a Right, what had they to transfer?</p>
                     <p>The Covenant mentioned at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> was but a Conditional Contract, and God but a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional King; and though the People promiſed to obey God's word, yet it was more than they were able to perform, for they often diſobeyed God's Voice, which being a breach of the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Covenant was void, and God not their King by Contract.</p>
                     <p>It is complained by God, <hi>They have rejected me that I ſhould reign over them:</hi> but it is not ſaid, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Contract; for I do not find that the Deſiring of a King was a breach of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of Covenant, or diſobedience to the Voice of God: there is no ſuch Law extant.</p>
                     <p>The People did not totally reject the Lord, but in part only, out of timorouſneſs, when they ſaw <hi>Nahaſh</hi> King of the Children of <hi>Ammon</hi> come againſt them; they diſtruſted that God would not ſuddenly provide for their Deliverance, as if they had had always a King in readineſs to go up pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:93433:108"/>
to fight for them: This Deſpair in them who had found ſo many miraculous deliverances under Gods Government, was that which offended the Lord ſo highly: they did not deſire an Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Government, and to caſt off God's Laws, but hoped for a certainer and ſpeedier deliverance from danger in time of War. They did not peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they might chooſe their King themſelves, that had been a greater ſin; and yet if they had, it had not been a total rejection of God's Reigning over them, as long as they deſired not to depart from the Worſhip of God their King, and from the Obedience of his Laws. I ſee not that the Kingdom of God was caſt off by the Election of <hi>Saul,</hi> ſince <hi>Saul</hi> was choſen by God himſelf, and governed according to God's Laws. The Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Saul</hi> is no where called the Kingdom of God, nor is it ſaid, that the Kingdom of God was caſt off at the Election of <hi>Saul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> allows, that <hi>Moſes alone had, next un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God, the Sovereignty over the Iſraelites,</hi> p. 252. but he doth not allow it to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> but will have it deſcend to <hi>Eleazar</hi> the High-Prieſt, <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Son, His Proof is, God expreſly ſaith concerning <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua, He ſhall ſtand before</hi> Eleazar, <hi>who ſhall ask Counſel for him before the Lord,</hi> (after the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>

The Work of the High-Prieſt was only <hi>Miniſterial,</hi> not <hi>Magiſterial</hi>; he had no power to Command in War, or to Judge in Peace; only when the Sovereign or Governour did go up to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:93433:109"/>
War, he enquired of the Lord by the Miniſtry of the High Prieſt, and, as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſay, the Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer with a ſoft voice, as one that prayeth for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, asked: and forthwith the Holy Ghoſt came upon the Prieſt, and he beheld the Breaſt-plate, and ſaw therein by the Viſion of Prophecy, <hi>Go up,</hi> or <hi>go not up,</hi> in the letters that ſhewed forth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the Breaſt-plate before his face: then the Prieſt anſwered him, <hi>Go up,</hi> or <hi>go not up.</hi> If this Anſwer gave the Prieſt Sovereignty, then neither King <hi>Saul</hi> nor King <hi>David</hi> had the Sovereignty, who both asked Counſel of the Lord by the Prieſt.</p>

                     <p>AMong the many Printed Books, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Diſcourſes touching the Right of <hi>Kings,</hi> and the Liberty of the <hi>People,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find that as yet the firſt and chief Point is agreed upon, or indeed ſo much as once diſputed. The word <hi>King</hi> and the word <hi>People</hi> are familiar, one would think every ſimple man could tell what they ſignified; but upon Examination it will be found, that the learnedſt cannot agree of their meaning.</p>
                     <p>Ask <hi>Salmaſius</hi> what a King is, and he will teach us, that <hi>a King is he who hath the Supreme Power of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:93433:110"/>
the Kingdom, and is accountable to none but God, and may do what he pleaſe, and is free from the Laws.</hi> This Definition <hi>J. M.</hi> abominates as being the Definition of a Tyrant: And I ſhould be of his Mind, if he would have vouchſafed us a better, or any other Definition at all, that would tell us how any King can have a Supreme Power, without being freed from humane Laws: To find fault with it, without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing any other, is to leave us in the Dark: but though Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> brings us neither Definition nor Deſcription of a King, yet we may pick out of ſeveral Paſſages of him, ſomething like a Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if we lay them together. He teacheth us that <hi>Power was therefore given to a King by the People, that he might ſee by the Authority to him committed, that nothing be done againſt Law: and that he keep our Laws, and not impoſe upon us his own: Therefore there is no Regal Power but in the Courts of the Kingdom, and by them, pag.</hi> 155.</p>
                     <p>And again he affirmeth, <hi>the King cannot Impriſon, Fine or puniſh any man, except he be firſt cited into ſome Court; where not the King, but the uſual Judges give Sentence,</hi> pag. 168. and before we are told, <hi>not the King, but the Authority of Parliament doth ſet up and take away all Courts,</hi> pag. 167.</p>
                     <p>Lo here the Deſcription of a King, He is <hi>one to whom the People give Power, to ſee that nothing be done againſt Law:</hi> and yet he ſaith there is <hi>no Regal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er but in the Courts of Juſtice and by them, where not the King, but the uſual Judges give Sentence.</hi> This Deſcription not only ſtrips the King of all Power whatſoever, but puts him in a Condition below the meaneſt of his Subjects.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="183" facs="tcp:93433:110"/>Thus much may ſhew, that all men are not agreed what a King is. Next, what the word <hi>People</hi> means is not agreed upon: ask <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> what the People is, and he will not allow any Power to be in any but in free Citizens. If we demand, who be free Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens; That he cannot reſolve us; for he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that <hi>he that is a free Citizen in one City, is not ſo in another City.</hi> And he is of Opinion that <hi>no Artificer ſhould be a free Citizen, or have Voice in a well ordered Commonwealth</hi>; he accounts a <hi>Democratie</hi> (which word ſignifies the Government of the People) <hi>to be a corrupted ſort of Government</hi>; he thinks <hi>many men by Nature born to be Servants, and not fit to govern as any part of the People.</hi> Thus doth <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> curtail the People, and cannot give us any certain Rule to know who be the People. Come to our Modern Politicians, and ask them who the People is, though they talk big of the People, yet they take up, and are content with a <hi>few Repreſentors</hi> (as they call them) <hi>of the whole People</hi>; a Point <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was to ſeek in, neither are theſe Repreſentors ſtood upon to be the whole People, but the <hi>major part of theſe Repreſentors muſt be reckoned for the whole People</hi>; nay <hi>J.M.</hi> will not allow the major part of the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentors to be the People, but the <hi>ſounder and better part only</hi> of them; and in right down terms he tells us, pag. 126. <hi>to determine who is a Tyrant, he leaves to Magiſtrates, at leaſt to the uprighter ſort of them and of the People,</hi> pag. 7. <hi>though in number leſs by many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to judge as they find cauſe.</hi> If the <hi>ſounder, the better, and the uprighter</hi> Part have the Power of the People, how ſhall we know, or who ſhall judge who they be?</p>

                     <p>One Text is urged by Mr. <hi>Milton,</hi> for the Peoples Power: Deut. 17.14. <hi>When thou art come into the Land which thy Lord thy God giveth thee, and ſhalt ſay, I will ſet a King over me, like as all the Nations about me.</hi> It is ſaid, by the Tenure of Kings <hi>theſe words confirm us that the Right of Chooſing, yea of Changing their own Government, is by the Grant of God himſelf in the People:</hi> But can the foretelling or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warning of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of a wanton and wicked Deſire of theirs, which God himſelf condemned, be made an Argument that God gave or granted them a Right to do ſuch a wicked thing? or can the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and reproving of a Future Fact, be a Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and approving of a preſent Right, or the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of a Sin be made a Commiſſion for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it? The Author of his Book againſt <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> falls ſo far from making God the Donor or Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, that he cites him only for a Witneſs, <hi>Teſte ipſo Deo penes populos arbitrium ſemper fuiſſe, vel ea, quae placeret forma reipub. utendi, vel hanc in aliam mutan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di; de Hebraeis hoc diſertè dicit Deus: de reliquis non abnuit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That</hi> here in this Text <hi>God himſelf being Witneſs, there was always a Power in the People, either to uſe what Form of Government they pleaſed, or of changing it into another: God ſaith this expreſly of the</hi> Hebrews, <hi>and denies it not of others.</hi> Can any man find that God in this Text expreſly ſaith, that there was always a Right in the People to uſe what Form of Government they pleaſe? The Text not warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Right of the People, the Foundation of the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:93433:111"/>
Defence of the People is quite taken away; there being no other Grant or proof of it pretended.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Where it is ſaid, that <hi>the Iſraelites deſired a King, though then under another Form of Government</hi>; in the next line but one it is confeſſed, they had a King at the time when they deſired a King, which was God himſelf, and his Vice-roy <hi>Samuel</hi>; and ſo ſaith God, <hi>They have not rejected thee; but they have rejected me, that I ſhould not reign over them</hi>; yet in the next Verſe God ſaith, <hi>As they have forſaken me, ſo do they alſo unto thee.</hi> Here is no Shew of any other Form of Government but Monarchy: God by the Mediation of <hi>Samuel</hi> reigned, who made his Sons Judges over <hi>Iſrael</hi>; when one man conſtitutes Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, we may call him a King; or if the having of Judges do alter the Government, then the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every Kingdom is altered from Monarchy, where Judges are appointed by Kings: it is now reckoned one of the Duties of Kings to judge by their Judges only.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Where it is ſaid, <hi>He ſhall not multiply to himſelf Horſes, nor Wives, nor Riches, that he might underſtand that he had no Power over others, who could Decree nothing of himſelf, extra Legem</hi>; if it had ſaid, <hi>contra legem Dei,</hi> it had been true, but if it meant <hi>extra legem humanam,</hi> it is falſe.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If there had been any Right given to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it ſeems it was to the Elders only; for it is ſaid, it was the Elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> gathered together, petitioned for a King; it is not ſaid, it was all the People, nor that the People did chooſe the Elders, who were the Fathers and Heads of Families, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by the Judges.</p>

To ſet a King,</hi> is, not to chooſe a King, but by ſome ſolemn publick Act of Coronation, or otherwiſe to acknowledge their Allegiance to the King choſen; It is ſaid, thou ſhalt <hi>ſet him King whom the Lord thy God ſhall chooſe.</hi> The Elders did not deſire to chooſe a King like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations, but they ſay, <hi>now make us a King to judge us like all the Nations.</hi>

                        <hi>Jus Regni</hi> is much ſtumbled at, and the Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a King which ſaith, <hi>His Power is ſupreme in the Kingdom, and he is accountable to none but to God, and that he may do what he pleaſe, and is not bound by Laws:</hi> it is ſaid if this Definition be good, no man is or ever was, who may be ſaid to be a Tyrant, <hi>p.</hi> 14. for <hi>when he hath violated all divine and humane Laws, nevertheleſs he is a King, and guiltleſs jure Regio.</hi> To this may be anſwered, That the Definition confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth he is accountable to God, and therefore not guiltleſs if he violate Divine Laws: Humane Laws muſt not be ſhuffled in with Divine, they are not of the ſame Authority: if humane Laws bind a King, it is impoſſible for him to have Supreme Power amongſt men. If any man can find us out ſuch a kind of Government, wherein the ſupreme Power can be, without being freed from humane Laws, they ſhould firſt teach us that: but if all ſorts of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Government that can be invented, cannot be one Minute, without an Arbitrary Power, freed from all humane Laws: what reaſon can be given why a Royal Government ſhould not have the like Freedom? if it be Tyranny for one man to govern arbitrarily, why ſhould it not be far greater Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny for a multitude of men to govern without being accountable or bound by Laws? It would be further enquired how it is poſſible for any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all to be in the World without an arbitrary Power; it is not Power except it be arbitrary: a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative Power cannot be without being abſolved from humane Laws, it cannot be ſhewed how a
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:93433:113"/>
King can have any Power at all but an arbitrary Power. We are taught, that <hi>Power was therefore gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a King by the People, that he might ſee by the Authority to him committed, that nothing be done againſt Law; and that he keep our Laws, and not impoſe upon us his own: therefore there is no Royal Power, but in the Courts of the Kingdom, and by them,</hi> p. 155. And again it is ſaid, <hi>the King cannot Impriſon, Fine or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh any man except he be firſt cited into ſome Court, where not the King but the uſual Judges give Sentence,</hi> pag. 168. and before, we are told, <hi>not the</hi> King, <hi>but the Authority of</hi> Parliament <hi>doth ſet up and take away all Courts,</hi> pag. 167.</p>
                     <p>Lo here we have Mr. <hi>Milton</hi>'s perfect Definition of a King: He is one to whom the People gave <hi>Power to ſee that nothing be done againſt Law, and that he keep our Laws, and not impoſe his own.</hi> Whereas all other men have the Faculty of Seeing by Nature, the King only hath it by the Gift of the People, other Power he hath none; he may ſee the Judges keep the Laws if they will; he cannot compel them, for he may not Impriſon, Fine, nor puniſh any man; the Courts of Juſtice may, and they are ſet up and put down by the Parliament: yet in this very Definition of a King, we may ſpy an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power in the King; for he may wink if he will: and no other Power doth this Deſcription of a King give, but only a Power to ſee: whereas it is ſaid <hi>Ariſtotle doth mention an abſolute Kingdom, for no other Cauſe, but to ſhew how abſurd, unjuſt and moſt tyrannical it is.</hi> There is no ſuch thing ſaid by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> but the contrary, where he ſaith, that a <hi>King according to Law makes no ſort of Government</hi>; and after he had reckoned up five ſorts of Kings, he
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:93433:113"/>
concludes, that there were in a manner but two ſorts, the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> King, and the Abſolute King; whereof the firſt was but as General in an Army, and therefore no King at all, and then fixes and reſts upon the <hi>Abſolute King, who ruleth according to his own Will.</hi>

                     <p>A Father may dye for the Murther of his Son, where there is a Superiour Father to them both, or the Right of ſuch a Supreme Father; but where there are only Father and Sons, no Sons can queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Father for the death of their Brother: the reaſon why a King cannot be puniſhed, is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is excepted from Puniſhment, or doth not deſerve it, but becauſe there is no Superiour to judge him, but God only, to whom he is reſerved.</p>

                  <p>If there hath been a time when all things were common, and all men equal, and that it be otherwiſe now; we muſt needs conclude that the Law by which all things were common, and men equal, was contrary to the Law by which now things are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and men ſubject.</p>
                  <p>If we will allow <hi>Adam</hi> to have been Lord of the World and of his Children, there will need no ſuch Diſtinctions of the Law of Nature and of Nations: For the Truth will be, that whatſoever the Heathens comprehended under theſe two Laws, is compriſed in the Moral Law.</p>

                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:93433:119"/>That the Law of Nature is one and the ſame with the Moral, may appear by a Definition gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>Grotius. The Law of Nature</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the Dictate of Reaſon, ſhewing that in every Action by the agreeing or diſagreeing of it with natural Reaſon, there is a moral Honeſty or Diſhoneſty, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that ſuch an Action is commanded or forbidden by God the Author of Nature.</hi> I cannot tell how <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> would otherwiſe have defined the Moral Law.

                  <p>The Term of <hi>Jus Naturae</hi> is not originally to be found in Scripture, for though <hi>T.

As for that which they call the Law of <hi>Nations,</hi> it is not a Law diſtinct, much leſs op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> but it is a ſmall Branch or Parcel of that great Law; for it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Law of Nature, or the moral Law between Nations. The ſame Commandment that forbids one Private man to rob another, or one Corporation to hurt another Corporation, obliges alſo one King not to rob another King, and one Commonwealth not to ſpoil another: the ſame Law that enjoyns Charity to all men, even to Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:93433:120"/>
binds Princes and States to ſhew Charity to one another, as well as private Perſons.</p>
                  <p>And as the <hi>Common, or Civil Laws</hi> of each Kingdom which are made againſt Treaſon, Theft, Murder, Adultery, or the like, are all and every one of them grounded upon ſome particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the moral Law; ſo all the Laws of Nations muſt be ſubordinate and reducible to the moral Law.</p>
                  <p>The Law of Nature, or the moral Law is like the main Ocean, which though it be one entire Body, yet ſeveral Parts of it have diſtinct Names, according to the diverſity of the Coaſts on which they border. So it comes to paſs that the Law of Nations, which is but a part of the Law of Nature, may be ſub-divided almoſt <hi>in infinitum,</hi> according to the Variety of the Perſons, or Matters about which it is converſant.</p>
                  <p>The Law of Nature or the divine Law is general, and doth only comprehend ſome Principles of Morality notoriouſly known of themſelves, or at the moſt is extended to thoſe things which by neceſſary and evident Inference are conſequent to thoſe Principles. Beſides theſe, many other things are neceſſary to the well governing of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: and therefore it was neceſſary that by Humane Reaſon ſomething more in particular ſhould be determined concerning thoſe things which could not be defined by Natural Reaſon alone; hence it is that Humane Laws be neceſſary, as Comments upon the Text of the Moral Law: and of this Judgment is <hi>Aquinas,</hi> who teacheth, that <hi>neceſſitas legis humanae manat ex eo, quod Lex

Ludo. Molin. de Just.</hi> Thus much may ſuffice to ſhew the Diſtractions in and between the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Common Laws</hi> about the Law of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Nations.</hi> In the next place we are to conſider how <hi>Grotius</hi> diſtinguiſheth theſe Laws.</p>
                  <p>To maintain the Community of things to be Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, <hi>Grotius</hi> hath framed new Diviſions of the Law of Nature. Firſt, in his Preface to his Books <hi>De Jure Belli &amp; Pacis,</hi> he produceth a Definition of the Law of Nature, in ſuch doubtful, obſcure and reſerved Terms, as if he were diffident of his Undertaking: Next in his firſt Book and firſt Chapter he gives us another Diſtribution, which differs from his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in his Preface.</p>
                  <p>In his Preface his Principle is, that the <hi>Appetite of Society, that is to ſay, of Community, is an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proper to man.</hi> Here he preſently corrects him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with an Exception, that <hi>ſome other Creatures are found to deſire Society</hi>; and withal he anſwers the Objections thus, that <hi>this Deſire of Society in brute Beasts, comes from ſome external Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> What he means by <hi>Principium intelligens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecum,</hi> I underſtand not, nor doth he explain, nor is it material, nor is the Argument he uſeth
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:93433:121"/>
to any purpoſe; for, admitting all he ſaith to be true, yet his Principle fails; for the Queſtion is not, from what Principle this Deſire of Society proceeds in Beaſts, but whether there be ſuch a Deſire or no. Beſides, here he takes the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of Society and Community to be all one, whereas many live in Society, which live not in Community.</p>
                  <p>Next he teacheth, that <hi>the keeping of Society (cuſtodia Societatis) which in a rude manner</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we have now expreſſed, is the fountain of that Law which is properly ſo called.</hi> I conceive by the Law properly ſo called, he intends the Law of Nature, though he expreſs not ſo much: And to this appetite of <hi>Sociable Community</hi> he refers <hi>Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni Abſtinentia</hi>; but herein it may be he forgets himſelf, for where there is <hi>Community</hi> there is neither <hi>meum</hi> nor <hi>tuum,</hi> nor yet <hi>alienum</hi>; and if there be no <hi>alienum,</hi> there can be no <hi>alieni abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentia.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe he ſaith, that by <hi>the Law of Nature</hi> men muſt <hi>ſtand to bargains, Juris naturae ſit ſtare pactis.</hi> But if all things were common by Nature, how could there be any bargain?</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>Grotius</hi> tells us, that <hi>from this ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law there hath flowed another larger,</hi> which conſiſts (ſaith he) <hi>in Diſcerning what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights us or hurts us, and in judging how things ſhould be wiſely diſtributed to each one.</hi> This latter he calls the <hi>looſer Law of Nature</hi>; the former <hi>Jus Sociale, the Law of Nature, ſtrictly, or proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken. And theſe two Laws of Nature ſhould have place</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>though men ſhould deny there were a
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:93433:121"/>
a God. But to them that believe there is a God, there is another Original of Law, beſide the Natural, coming from the free Will of God, to the which our own <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding tells us we muſt be ſubject.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus have I gathered the Subſtance of what is moſt material concerning the Law of Nature, in his Preface.</p>

                  <p>In the Definition of <hi>Jus Naturale</hi> he omits thoſe Subtleties of <hi>Jus Naturae propriè dictum,</hi> and <hi>quod laxius ita dicitur,</hi> which we find in his Preface, and gives ſuch a plain Definition, as may fitly agree to the Moral Law. By this it ſeems the Law of Nature and the Moral Law are one and the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="206" facs="tcp:93433:122"/>Whereas he affirmeth, That <hi>the Actions about which the Law of Nature is converſant, are lawful or unlawful of themſelves, and therefore are neceſſarily commanded or forbidden by God: by which mark this Law of Nature doth not only differ from humane Law, but from the Divine voluntary Law, which doth not command or forbid thoſe things, which of themſelves, and by their own nature are lawful or unlawful, but makes them unlawful by forbidding them, and due by commanding them:</hi> In this he ſeems to make the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> to differ from <hi>Gods Voluntary Law</hi>; whereas, in God, <hi>Neceſſary</hi> and <hi>Voluntary</hi> are all one. <hi>Salmaſius de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſuris,</hi> in the twentieth Chapter, condemns this Opinion of <hi>Grotius</hi>; though he name him not, yet he means him, if I miſtake not.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, I obſerve his ſaying, That ſome things are by the Law of Nature, not <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priè,</hi> but <hi>reductivè</hi>; and that the <hi>Law of Nature deals not only with thoſe things which are beſide the Will of Man, but alſo with many things which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the act of Man's Will: ſo Dominion, ſuch as is now in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, mans Will brought in; but now that it is brought in, it is againſt the Law of Nature, to take that from thee againſt thy will, which is in thy Dominion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet for all this <hi>Grotius</hi> maintains, That the <hi>Law of Nature is ſo immutable, that it cannot be changed by God himſelf.</hi> He means to make it good with a Diſtinction: <hi>Some things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are by the Law of Nature, but not ſimply, but according to the certain ſtate of things; ſo the common uſe of things was natural as long as Dominion was not brought in; and Right for every man to take his own
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:93433:122"/>
by Force, before Laws were made.</hi> Here if <hi>Grotius</hi> would have ſpoken plain, inſtead of <hi>but not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, but according to the certain State of Things,</hi> he would have ſaid, <hi>but not immutably, but for a certain Time.</hi> And then this Diſtinction would have run thus; <hi>Some things are by the Law of Nature, but not immutably, but for a certain time.</hi> This muſt needs be the naked Senſe of his Diſtinction, as appears by his Explication in the Words following, where he ſaith, That <hi>the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Things was natural ſo long as Dominion was not brought in:</hi> Dominion, he ſaith, was brought in by the will of man, whom by this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine <hi>Grotius</hi> makes to be able to change that Law which God himſelf cannot change, as he ſaith. He gives a double ability to man; firſt, to make that no Law of Nature, which God made to be the Law of Nature: And next, to make that a Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which God made not; for now that Dominion is brought in, he maintains, it is againſt the Law of Nature to take that which is in another man's dominion.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, I find no Coherence in theſe Words, <hi>By the Law of Nature it was right for every man to take his own by force, before Laws made,</hi> ſince by the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> no man had any thing of his own; and until Laws were made, there was no Propriety, according to his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jus Humanum voluntarium latius patens,</hi> he makes to be <hi>the Law of Nations, which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by the Will of All, or Many Nations, hath received a power to bind,</hi> he adds, <hi>of Many, becauſe
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:93433:123"/>
there is,</hi> as he grants, <hi>ſcarce any Law to be found common to all Nations, beſides the Law of Nature; which alſo is wont to be called the Law of Nations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing common to all Nations.</hi> Nay, as he confeſſeth often, <hi>That is the Law in one part of the World, which in another part of the World is not the Law of Nations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By theſe Sentences, it ſeems <hi>Grotius</hi> can ſcarce tell what to make to be the Law of Nations, or where to find it.</p>
                  <p>Whereas he makes the Law of Nations to have a binding Power from the Will of men, it muſt be remembred, That it is not ſufficient for men to have a Will to bind, but it is neceſſary alſo to have a Power to bind: Though ſeveral Nations have one and the ſame Law.</p>
                  <p>For inſtance: Let it be granted that Theft is puniſhed by Death in many Countries, yet this doth not make it to be a Law of Nations, becauſe each Nation hath it but as a Natural, or Civil Law of their own Country; and though it have a binding Power from the Will of many Nations, yet becauſe each Nation hath but a Will and Power to bind themſelves, and may without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, conſent, or conſulting of any Neighbour-Nation, alter this Law, if they find Cauſe, it cannot properly be called <hi>the Law of Nations.</hi> That which is the foundation of the Law of Nations, is, to have it concern <hi>ſuch things as belong to the mutual Society of Nations among themſelves,</hi>

                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note> as <hi>Grotius</hi> confeſſeth; and not of ſuch things as have no further relation than to the particular Benefit of each Kingdom: For, as
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:93433:123"/>
private men muſt neglect their own Profit for the Good of their Country; ſo particular Nations muſt ſometimes remit part of their Benefit, for the Good of many Nations.</p>
                  <p>True it is, that in particular Kingdoms and Commonwealths there be Civil and National Laws, and alſo Cuſtoms that obtain the Force of Laws: But yet ſuch Laws are ordained by ſome ſupreme Power, and the Cuſtoms are examined, judged, and allowed by the ſame ſupreme Power. Where there is no Supreme Power that extends over all or many Nations, but only God himſelf, there can be no Laws made to bind Nations, but ſuch as are made by God himſelf: we cannot find that God made any Laws to bind Nations, but only the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law; as for the Judicial Law, though it were ordained by God, yet it was not the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but of one Nation only, and fitted to that Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>If any think that the Cuſtoms wherein many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do conſent, may be called the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as well as the Cuſtoms of any one Nation may be eſteemed for National Laws: They are to conſider, That it is not the being of a Cuſtom that makes it lawful, for then all Cuſtoms, even evil Cuſtoms, would be lawful; but it is the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the ſupreme Power that gives a legality to the Cuſtom: where there is no Supreme Power over many Nations, their Cuſtoms cannot be made legal.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrine of <hi>Grotius</hi> is, That <hi>God immediately after the Creation did beſtow
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:93433:124"/>
upon Mankind in general a Right over things of inferiour Nature — From whence it came to paſs, that preſently every man might ſnatch what he would for his own <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, and ſpend what he could, and ſuch an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Right was then inſtead of Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for what every one ſo ſnatched, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could not take from him but by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How repugnant this Aſſertion of <hi>Grotius</hi> is to the Truth of Holy Scripture, Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> teacheth us in his <hi>Mare Clauſum,</hi>
                     <note rend="inter">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</note> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That <hi>Adam by Donation from God,</hi> Gen. 1.28. <hi>was made the general Lord of all things, not without ſuch a private Dominion to himſelf, as (without his Grant) did exclude his Children: and by Donation and Aſſignation, or ſome kind of Ceſſion (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was dead, or left any Heir to ſucceed him) his Children had their diſtinct Territories by Right of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Dominion:</hi> Abel <hi>had his Flocks and Paſtures for them</hi>; Cain <hi>had his Fields for Corn, and the Land of</hi> Nod <hi>where he built himſelf a City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Determination of Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to the Hiſtory of the Bible, and to natural Reaſon, doth contradict the Doctrine of <hi>Grotius:</hi> I cannot conceive why Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> ſhould afterwards affirm, That <hi>neither the Law of Nature, nor the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law, do command or forbid either Communion of all things or private Dominion, but permitteth both.</hi>

                     <pb n="211" facs="tcp:93433:124"/>As for the general Community between <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons, which Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> will have to be granted to them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.2. the Text doth not warrant it; for although the Sons are there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned with <hi>Noah</hi> in the Bleſſing, yet it may beſt be underſtood with a Subordination or a Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in Succeſſion, the Bleſſing might truly be fulfilled, if the Sons either under, or after their Father enjoyed a Private Dominion: it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the private Dominion which God gave to <hi>Adam,</hi> and by his Donation, Aſſignation, or Ceſſion to his Children was abrogated, and a Community of all things inſtituted between <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons, at the time of the Flood: <hi>Noah</hi> was left the ſole Heir of the World, why ſhould it be thought that God would diſ-inherit him of his Birth-right, and make him of all the men in the World, the only Tenant in Common with his Children? If the Bleſſing given to <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 1.28. be compared to that given to <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.2. there will be found a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Difference between thoſe two Texts: In the Benediction of <hi>Adam,</hi> we find expreſſed a <hi>ſubduing of the Earth, and a Dominion over the Creatures,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which are expreſſed in the Bleſſing of <hi>Noah,</hi> nor the Earth there once named, it is only ſaid, <hi>The fear of you ſhall be upon the creatures, and into your hands are they delivered</hi>; then immediately it follows, <hi>Every moving thing ſhall be meat for you, as the green herb.</hi> The firſt Bleſſing gave <hi>Adam Dominion</hi> over the Earth and all Creatures, the latter allows <hi>Noah</hi> liberty to uſe the living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for food: here is no alteration or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:93433:125"/>
of his Title to a Propriety of all things, but an Enlargement only of his Commons.</p>
                  <p>But whether, with <hi>Grotius,</hi> Community came in at the Creation, or, with Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> at the Flood, they both agree it did not long continue; <hi>Sed veri non eſt ſimile hujuſmodi communionem diu obtinuiſſe,</hi> is the confeſſion of Mr. <hi>Selden.</hi> It ſeems ſtrange that <hi>Grotius</hi> ſhould maintain, that Community of all things ſhould be by the Law of Nature, of which God is the Author; and yet ſuch Community ſhould not be able to continue: Doth it not dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the Providence of God Almighty, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain a Community which could not continue? Or doth it make the Act of our Fore-fathers, in abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the natural Law of Community, by introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing that of Propriety, to be a ſin of a high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption?</p>
                  <p>The prime Duties of the Second Table are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant about the Right of Propriety: but if Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety be brought in by a Humane Law (as <hi>Grotius</hi> teacheth) then the Moral Law depends upon the Will of man. There could be no Law againſt Adultery or Theft, if Women and all things were common.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> ſaith, That the Law of Nature, or of God, <hi>nec vetuit, nec jubebat, ſed permiſit utrumque, tam nempe rerum communionem quàm privatum Dominium.</hi> And yet for Propriety (which he terms <hi>primaeva re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Dominia)</hi> he teacheth, That <hi>Adam received it from God, à Numine acceperat:</hi> And for Community, he ſaith, <hi>We meet with evident footſteps of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of things in that donation of God, by which</hi> Noah <hi>and his three Sons are made Domini pro indiviſo rerum
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:93433:125"/>
omnium.</hi> Thus he makes the private Dominion of <hi>Adam,</hi> as well as the common Dominion of <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons, to be both by the Will of God. Nor doth he ſhew how <hi>Noah,</hi> or his Sons, or their Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, had any Authority to alter the Law of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity which was given them by God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In diſtributing Territories</hi> (Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> ſaith) <hi>the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as it were, of Mankind (paſſing their promiſe, which ſhould alſo bind their Poſterity) did intervene, ſo that men departed from their common Right of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of thoſe things which were ſo diſtributed to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Lords or Maſters.</hi> This Diſtribution by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Mankind, we muſt take upon Credit; for there is not the leaſt proof offered for it out of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity.</p>
                  <p>How the Conſent of Mankind could bind Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity when all things were common, is a Point not ſo evident: where Children take nothing by Gift or by Deſcent from their Parents, but have an equal and common Intereſt with them, there is no reaſon in ſuch caſes, that the Acts of the Fathers ſhould bind the Sons.</p>
                  <p>I find no cauſe why Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> ſhould call <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity a priſtine Right</hi>; ſince he makes it but to begin in <hi>Noah,</hi> and to end in <hi>Noah</hi>'s Children, or Grand children at the moſt; for he confeſſeth the Earth, <hi>à Noachidis ſeculis aliquot poſt diluvium eſſe diviſam.</hi>

                  <p>That ancient Tradition, which by Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>'s acknowledgment hath obtained Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion every where, ſeems moſt reaſonable, in that he tells us, That <hi>Noah himſelf, as Lord of all, was Author of the Diſtribution of the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:93433:126"/>
World, and of private Dominion, and that by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of an Oracle from God, he did confirm this Diſtribution by his laſt Will and Teſtament, which at his Death he left in the hands of his eldeſt Son</hi> Sem, <hi>and alſo warned all his Sons, that none of them ſhould invade any of their Brothers Dominions, or injure one another, becauſe from thence Diſcord and Civil War would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow.</hi>

                  <p>Upon theſe two Propoſitions of natural Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity and voluntary Propriety, depend divers dangerous and ſeditious Concluſions, which are diſperſed in ſeveral places. In the fourth Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter of the firſt Book, the Title of which Chapter is, <hi>Of the War of Subjects againſt Superiours; Grotius</hi> handleth the Queſtion, <hi>Whether the Law of not reſiſting Superiours, do bind us in moſt grievous and moſt certain danger?</hi> And his Determination is, That <hi>this Law of not reſiſting Superiours, ſeems to depend upon the Will of thoſe men who at firſt joyned themſelves in a Civil Society, from whom the Right of Government doth come to them that govern; if thoſe had been at firſt asked, if their Will were to impoſe this burthen upon all, that they ſhould chuſe rather to dye, than in any caſe by Arms to repel the Force of Superiours; I know not whether they would anſwer, That it was their Will, unleſs perhaps with
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:93433:126"/>
this addition, if Reſiſtance cannot be made but with the great diſturbance of the Common-wealth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of many Innocents.</hi> Here we have his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, that in great and certain danger, men may reſiſt their Governours, if it may be without diſturbance of the Common-wealth: if you would know who ſhould be Judge of the greatneſs and certainty of the Danger, or how we may know it, <hi>Grotius</hi> hath not one word of it, ſo that for ought appears to the contrary, his mind may be, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry private man may be Judge of the Danger, for other Judge he appoints none; it had been a foul Fault in ſo deſperate a piece of Service, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of Superiours, to have concealed the lawful Means, by which we may judge of the Greatneſs or Certainty of publick Danger, before we lift up our hands againſt Authority, conſidering how prone moſt of us are, to cenſure and miſtake thoſe things for great and certain Dangers, which in truth many times are no dangers at all, or at the moſt but very ſmall ones; and ſo flatter our ſelves, that by reſiſting our Superiours, we may do our Country laudable Service, without Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of the Common-wealth, ſince the Effects of Sedition cannot be certainly judged of but by the Events only.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Grotius</hi> proceeds to anſwer an Objection againſt this Doctrine of reſiſting Superiours. <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>any man ſhall ſay, that this rigid Doctrine of dying, rather than reſiſting any Injuries of Superiours, is no humane, but a Divine Law: It is to be noted, that men at firſt, not by any Precept of God, but of their own Accord, led by Experience of the Infirmities of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:93433:127"/>
ſeparated Families againſt Violence, did meet together in Civil Society, from whence Civil Power took begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which therefore St.</hi> Peter <hi>calls an humane Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, although elſewhere it be called a divine Ordinance, becauſe God approveth the wholeſom Inſtitutions of men; God in approving a humane Law is to be thought to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it as humane, and in a humane manner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And again in another place he goeth further, and teacheth us, That <hi>if the Queſtion happen to be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the primitive Will of the People, it will not be amiſs for the People that now are, and which are accounted the ſame with them that were long ago, to expreſs their meaning, in this matter, which is to be followed, unleſs it certainly appear, that the People long ago willed other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</hi> lib. 2. cap. 2.</p>
                  <p>For fuller Explication of his Judgment about re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting Superiors, he concludes thus: <hi>The greater the thing is which is to be preſerved, the greater is the Equity which reacheth forth an Exception againſt the words of the Law: yet I dare not</hi> (ſaith <hi>Grotius) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Difference condemn either ſimple men or a leſſer part of the People, who in the laſt Refuge of Neceſſity, do ſo uſe this Equity, as that in the mean time, they do not forſake the Reſpect of the common Good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another Doctrine of <hi>Grotius</hi> is, That <hi>the Empire which is exerciſed by Kings, doth not ceaſe to be the Empire of the People; that Kings who in a lawful Order ſucceed thoſe who were elected, have the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power by an uſufructuary Right only, and no Propriety.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Furthermore he teacheth, That <hi>the People may chuſe what Form of Government they pleaſe, and their Will is the Rule of Right.</hi> Populus eligere poteſt
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:93433:127"/>
qualem vult gubernationis formam, neque ex prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia formae, ſed ex voluntate jus metiendum eſt. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>Alſo, That <hi>the People chuſing a King may reſerve ſome Acts to themſelves, and may bestow others upon the King, with full Authority, if either an expreſs Partition be appointed, or if the People being yet free, do command their future King, by way of a ſtanding Command, or if any thing be added by which it may be underſtood, that the King may be compelled or elſe puniſhed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In theſe Paſſages of <hi>Grotius</hi> which I have cited, we find evidently theſe Doctrines.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>That Civil Power depends on the Will of the People.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>That private Men or petty Multitudes may take up Arms againſt their Princes.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. <hi>That the lawfulleſt Kings have no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in their Kingdoms, but an uſufructuary Right only: as if the People were the Lords, and Kings but their Tenants.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>4. <hi>That the Law of Not reſiſting Superiors, is a humane Law, depending on the Will of the People at firſt.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>5. <hi>That the Will of the firſt People, if it be not known, may be expounded by the People that now are.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:93433:128"/>No doubt but <hi>Grotius</hi> foreſaw what Uſes the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might make of theſe Doctrines, by concluding, if the chief Power be in the People, that then it is lawful for them to compel and puniſh Kings as oft as they miſuſe their Power: Therefore he tells us, He <hi>rejects the Opinion of them, who every where and without Exception will have the chief Power to be ſo the Peoples, that it is lawful for them to compel and puniſh Kings as oft as they miſuſe their Power</hi>; and <hi>this Opinion</hi> he confeſſeth, <hi>if it be altogether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, hath been and may be the cauſe of many Evils.</hi> This cautelous Rejection qualified with theſe Terms of <hi>every where without Exception,</hi> and <hi>alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> makes but a mixt Negation, partly <hi>negative,</hi> and partly <hi>affirmative</hi> (which our Lawyers call a <hi>negative Repugnant</hi>) which brings forth this modal Propoſition, <hi>That in ſome places with Exception, and in ſome ſort the People may compel and puniſh their Kings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But let us ſee how <hi>Grotius</hi> doth refute the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Opinion, <hi>That People may correct</hi> Kings. He frames his Argument in theſe words: <hi>It is lawful for every man to yield himſelf to be a private Servant to whom he pleaſe. What ſhould hinder, but that alſo it may be lawful for a free People ſo to yield them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to one or more, that the Right of governing them be fully ſet over without retaining any part of the Right? And you muſt not ſay, That this may not be preſumed; for we do not now ſeek, what in a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful caſe may be preſumed, but what by Right may be done.</hi> Thus far is the Argument, in which the moſt that is proved (if we gratifie him, and yield his whole Argument for good) is this, That
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:93433:128"/>
                     <hi>the People may grant away their Power without retaining any part.</hi> But what is this to what the People have done? For though the People may give away their Power without reſervation of any part to themſelves; yet if they have not ſo done, but have reſerved a part, <hi>Grotius</hi> muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that the People may compel and puniſh their Kings, if they tranſgreſs: ſo that by his favour, the point will be, not what by Right may be done, but what in this doubtful caſe hath been done, ſince by his own Rule <hi>it is the Will and Meaning of the firſt People that joyned in Society,</hi> that muſt regulate the Power of their Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours.</p>
                  <p>But on <hi>Grotius</hi> ſide it may be urged, That in all preſumption the People have given away their whole Power to Kings, unleſs they can prove they have reſerved a part; for if they will have any benefit of a Reſervation or Exception, it lies on their part to prove their Exception, and not on the Kings part who are in poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>This Anſwer, though in it ſelf it be moſt juſt and good; yet of all men <hi>Grotius</hi> may not uſe it. For he ſaves the Peoples labour of proving the primitive Reſervation of their Forefathers, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the People that now are competent Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the meaning of thoſe firſt Anceſtors, who may juſtly be preſumed, not to have been either ſo improvident for themſelves, or ſo negligent of all their Poſterity, when by the Law of Nature they were free, and had all things common, at an inſtant without any Condition or Limitation to give away that Liberty and Right of Community,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:93433:129"/>
and to make themſelves and their Children eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubject to the Will of ſuch Governours as might miſuſe them without Controul.</p>
                  <p>On the behalf of the People, it may be further anſwered to <hi>Grotius,</hi> That although our Anceſtors had made an abſolute Grant of their Liberty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Condition expreſſed; yet it muſt be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily implied, that it was upon condition to be well governed, and that the Non-performance of that implied Condition, makes the Grant void; Or, if we will not allow an implicit Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, then it may be ſaid, That the Grant in it ſelf was a void Grant, for being unreaſonable, and a violation of the Law of Nature, without any valuable Conſideration. What ſound Reply <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> can return to ſuch Anſwers, I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, if he keep himſelf to his firſt Principle of natural Community. As <hi>Grotius</hi>'s Argument againſt the People is not ſound, ſo his Anſwer to the Argument that is made for the People, is not ſatisfactory. It is objected, That <hi>he that ordains, is above him that is ordained. Grotius</hi> anſwers, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum duntaxat est in ea conſtitutione cujus effectus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuò pendet à voluntate conſtituentis, non etiam in ea quae ab initio eſt voluntatis, poſtea verò effectum habet neceſſitatis, quomodo mulier virum ſibi conſtituit, cui parere ſemper habet neceſſe.</hi> The Reply may be, That by <hi>Grotius</hi>'s former Doctrine the very Effect of the Conſtitution of Kings by the People, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends perpetually upon the Will of them that Conſtitute, and upon no other Neceſſity: he will not ſay, That it is by any neceſſity of the Law of Nature, or by any poſitive Law of God; he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:93433:129"/>
That <hi>non Dei praecepto, ſed ſponte,</hi> men entred into Civil Society, that it is an Humane Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that God doth only approve it <hi>ut huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> and <hi>humano modo.</hi> He tells us further, That <hi>Populus poteſt eligere qualem vult gubernationis for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam, &amp; ex voluntate jus metiendum eſt</hi>; that the People may give the King <hi>as little Power as they will, and for as little time as they pleaſe, that they may make temporary Kings, as Directors and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors: jus quovis tempore revocabile, id eſt, precarium</hi>; as the <hi>Vandals</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> and the <hi>Goths</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> would depoſe their Kings as oft as they diſpleaſed them, <hi>horum enim actus irriti poſſunt reddi ab his qui poteſtatem revocabiliter dederunt, ac proinde non idem eſt effectus nec jus idem.</hi> Here he doth teach in plain words, the Effect doth depend upon the Will of the People. By this we may judge how improperly he uſeth the inſtance of a Woman, that appoints her ſelf a Husband, whom ſhe muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways neceſſarily obey, ſince the neceſſity of the continuance of the VVife's obedience depends upon the Law of God, which hath made the Bond of Matrimony indiſſolvable. <hi>Grotius</hi> will not ſay the like for the continuance of the Subjects obedience to the Prince, neither will they ſay that VVomen may chuſe Husbands, as he tells us the People may chuſe Kings, by giving their Husbands as little power, and for as little a time as they pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>Next it is objected, That <hi>Tutors who are ſet over Pupils may be removed, if they abuſe their power. Grotius</hi> anſwers, <hi>In Tutore hoc procedit qui ſuperiorem habet, at in Imperiis quia progreſſus non datur in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:93433:130"/>
omnino in aliqua perſona aut coetu conſiſtendum eſt: We must stay in ſome one Perſon, or in a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, whoſe faults (becauſe they have no ſuperiour Judge above them) God hath witneſſed that he will have a particular care of, either to revenge them, if he judge it needful, or to tolerate them, either for Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, or Tryal of the People.</hi> It is true, in King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms we cannot proceed <hi>in infinitum,</hi> yet we may, and muſt go to the higheſt, which by <hi>Grotius</hi> his Rule is the People, becauſe they firſt made Kings, ſo that there is no need to ſtay <hi>in aliqua perſona,</hi> but in <hi>coetu,</hi> in the People, ſo that by his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine Kings may be puniſhed by the People, but the faults of the People muſt be left to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.</p>
                  <p>I have briefly preſented here the deſperate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences which attend upon the Doctrine of <hi>the natural freedom and community of all things</hi>; theſe and many more Abſurdities are eaſily remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if on the contrary we maintain the <hi>natural and private Dominion of Adam,</hi> to be the fountain of all Government and Propriety: And if we mark it well, we ſhall find that <hi>Grotius</hi> doth in part grant as much; The ground why thoſe that now live do obey their Governours, is the Will of their Forefathers, who at the firſt ordained Princes, and, in obedience to that Will, the Children con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in ſubjection; this is according to the mind of <hi>Grotius:</hi> ſo that the Queſtion is not, <hi>Whether Kings have a fatherly Power over their Subjects, but how Kings came firſt by it. Grotius</hi> will have it, that our Forefathers being all free, made an Aſſignment of their Power to Kings; the other Opinion denies
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:93433:130"/>
any ſuch general freedom of our Forefathers, but derives the Power of Kings from the Original Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This natural Dominion of <hi>Adam</hi> may be proved out of <hi>Grotius</hi> himſelf, who teacheth, That <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratione jus acquiritur Parentibus in Liberos,</hi> and that <hi>naturally no other can be found, but the Parents to whom the Government ſhould belong, and the Right of Ruling and Compelling them doth belong to Parents.</hi> And in another place he hath theſe words, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the fifth Commandment, <hi>Parentum nomine, qui naturales ſunt Magiſtratus, etiam alios Rectores par est intelligi, quorum authoritas Societatem huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam continet:</hi> and if Parents be natural Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, Children muſt needs be born natural Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                  <p>But although <hi>Grotius</hi> acknowledge Parents to be natural Magiſtrates, yet he will have it, that Children, when they come to full age, and are ſeparated from their Parents, are free from natural Subjection. For this he offers proof out of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> and out of Scripture. Firſt, for <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>; we muſt note, he doth not teach, that every ſeparation of Children of full age, is an Obtaining of liberty, as if that men when they come to years, might vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily ſeparate themſelves, and caſt off their natural Obedience; but <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaks only of a paſſive Separation; for he doth not ſay, that Children are ſubject to Parents <hi>until they do ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, but,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>until they be ſeparated,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in the Verb of the Paſſive Voice. That is, until by Law they be ſeparated: for the Law (which is nothing elſe but the Will of him that hath
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:93433:131"/>
the Power of the Supreme Father) doth in many caſes, for the publick Benefit of Society, free Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from ſubjection to the ſubordinate Parent, ſo that the natural Subjection by ſuch Emancipation of Children, is not extinguiſhed, but only aſſumed and regulated by the Parent paramount.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Grotius</hi> cites <hi>Numb.</hi> 30. to prove that <hi>the power of the Fathers over the Sons and Daughters, to diſſolve their Vows, was not perpetual, but during the time only whilſt the Children were part of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Family.</hi> But if we turn to the Chapter, we may find that <hi>Grotius</hi> either deceives himſelf or us; for there is not one word in that Chapter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Vows of Sons, but of Daughters only, being in their Father's Family; and the being of the Daughter in the Father's Houſe, meaneth only the Daughter's being a Virgin, and not married, which may be gathered by the Argument of the whole Chapter, which taketh particular order for the Vows of VVomen of all eſtates. Firſt, for Virgins, in the third Verſe. Secondly, for VVives in general, in the ſixth Verſe. Thirdly, for VVi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and VVomen divorced, in the ninth Verſe. There is no Law for Virgins out of their Father's Houſes; we may not think they would have been omitted, if they had been free from their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; we find no freedom in the Text for VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, till after Marriage: And if they were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, though they were in their Father's Houſes, yet the Fathers had no power of their Vows, but their Husbands.</p>
                  <p>If, by the Law of Nature, departure from the Father's Houſe had emancipated Children, why
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:93433:131"/>
doth the Civil Law, contrary to the Law of Nature, give power and remedy to Fathers for to recover by Action of Law their Children that depart, or are taken away from them without their conſent? Without the conſent of Parents the Civil Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows no emancipation.</p>
                  <p>Concerning Subjection of Children to Parents, <hi>Grotius</hi> diſtinguiſheth three ſeveral times.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is the time of <hi>Imperfect Judgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond is the time of <hi>Perfect Judgment:</hi> but <hi>whilſt the Son remains part of the Father's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third is, <hi>the time after he hath departed out of his Father's Family.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt time he ſaith. <hi>All the actions of Children are under the dominion of the Parents.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>During the ſecond time, <hi>when they are of the age of mature Judgment, they are under their Father's command in thoſe actions only, which are of moment for their Parents Family. In other actions the Children have a power or moral faculty of doing, but they are bound in thoſe alſo to ſtudy always to pleaſe their Parents. But ſince this Duty is not by force of any moral faculty, as thoſe former are, but only of Piety, Obſervance, and Duty of repaying Thanks; it doth not make any thing void which is done againſt it, as neither a gift of any thing is void, being made by any Owner whatſoever, againſt the rules of Parſimony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In both theſe times, the Right of Ruling and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling is</hi> (as <hi>Grotius</hi> acknowledgeth) <hi>comprehended ſo far forth as Children are to be compelled to their Duty, or amended; although the power of a Parent doth ſo follow the perſon of a Father, that it cannot be
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:93433:132"/>
pulled away, and transferred upon another, yet the Father may naturally pawn, or alſo ſell his Son, if there be need.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the third time he ſaith, <hi>The Son is in all things Free, and of his own Authority: always that Duty remaining of Piety and Obſervance, the cauſe of which is perpetual.</hi> In this triple diſtinction, though <hi>Grotius</hi> allow Children in ſome caſes during the ſecond, and in all caſes during the third time to be free, and of their own Power, by a moral Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty: yet, in that he confeſſeth, <hi>in all caſes Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are bound to ſtudy always to pleaſe their Parents out of Piety and Duty, the cauſe of which,</hi> as he ſaith, <hi>is perpetual:</hi> I cannot conceive, how in any caſe Children can naturally have any Power or moral Faculty of doing what they pleaſe without their Parents leave, ſince they are always bound to ſtudy to pleaſe their Parents. And though by the Laws of ſome Nations, Children, when they attain to years of Diſcretion, have Power and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in many actions; yet this Liberty is granted them by Poſitive and Humane Laws only, which are made by the Supreme Fatherly Power of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who Regulate, Limit, or Aſſume the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of inferiour Fathers, for the publick Benefit of the Commonwealth: ſo that naturally the Power of Parents over their Children never ceaſeth by any Separation, but only by the permiſſion of the tranſcendent Fatherly Power of the Supreme Prince, Children may be diſpenſed with, or privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in ſome caſes, from obedience to ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Parents.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="227" facs="tcp:93433:132"/>Touching the Point of diſſolving the Vows of Children, <hi>Grotius</hi> in his laſt Edition of his Book hath corrected his firſt: for in the firſt he teacheth, That <hi>the power of the Father was greater over the Daughter dwelling with him, than over the Son; for her Vow he might make void, but not his:</hi> But inſtead of theſe words, in his laſt Edition, he ſaith, That <hi>the power over the Son or Daughter to diſſolve Vows, was not perpetual, but did endure as long as the Children were a part of their Fathers Family.</hi> About the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Text out of which he draws this Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I have already ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>Three ways <hi>Grotius</hi> propoundeth, whereby <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power</hi> may be had.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Dictators, ſaith he, <hi>had Supreme Power by a Temporary Right; as well thoſe Kings who are firſt Elected, as thoſe that in a lawful Right ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to Kings elected, have Supreme Power by an uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fructuary Right: ſome Kings that have got Supreme Power by a juſt War, or into whoſe Power ſome People, for avoiding a greater Evil, have ſo yielded themſelves, as that they have excepted nothing, have a full Right of Propriety.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we find but two means acknowledged by <hi>Grotius,</hi> whereby <hi>a King may obtain a full Right of Propriety in a Kingdom: That is, either by a juſt War, or by Donation of the People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How a War can be juſt without a precedent Title in the Conquerour, <hi>Grotius</hi> doth not ſhew; and if the Title only make the War juſt, then no
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:93433:133"/>
other Right can be obtained by War, than what the Title bringeth; for a juſt War doth only put the Conquerour in poſſeſſion of his old Right, but not create a new. The like which <hi>Grotius</hi> ſaith of Succeſſion, may be ſaid of War. <hi>Succeſſion</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is no Title of a Kingdom, which gives a Form to the Kingdom, but a Continuation of the old; for the Right which began by the Election of the Family, is continued by Succeſſion; wherefore, ſo much as the firſt Election gave, ſo much the Succeſſion brings.</hi> So to a Conquerour that hath a Title, War doth not give, but put him in poſſeſſion of a Right: and except the Conquerour had a full Right of Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at firſt, his Conqueſt cannot give it him: for if originally he and his Anceſtors had but an uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fructuary Right, and were outed of the poſſeſſion of the Kingdom by an Uſurper: here, though the Re-conqueſt be a moſt juſt War, yet ſhall not the Conquerour in this caſe gain any full Right of Propriety, but muſt be remitted to his uſufru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary Right only: for what Juſtice can it be, that the Injuſtice of a third Perſon, an Uſurper, ſhould prejudice the People, to the deveſting of them of that Right of Propriety, which was reſerved in their firſt Donation to their Elected King, to whom they gave but an uſufructuary Right, as <hi>Grotius</hi> conceiveth? Wherefore it ſeems impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that there can be a juſt War, whereby a full Right of Propriety may be gained, according to <hi>Grotius</hi>'s Principles. For if a King come in by Conqueſt, he muſt either conquer them that have a Governour, or thoſe People that have none: if they have no Governour, then they are a free
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:93433:133"/>
People, and ſo the War will be unjuſt to conquer thoſe that are free, eſpecially if the Freedom of the People be by the primary Law of Nature, as <hi>Grotius</hi> teacheth: But if the People conquered have a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, that Governour hath either a Title or not: If he hath a Title, it is an unjuſt War that takes the Kingdom from him: If he hath no Title, but only the Poſſeſſion of a Kingdom, yet it is unjuſt for any other man, that wants a Title alſo, to conquer him that is but in poſſeſſion: for it is a juſt Rule, That where <hi>the Caſes are alike, he that is in Poſſeſſion is in the better condition; In pari cauſa poſſidentis melior conditio.</hi> Lib. 2. c. 23. And this by the Law of Nature, even in the Judgment of <hi>Grotius.</hi> But if it be admitted, that he that attempts to conquer hath a Title, and he that is in poſſeſſion hath none: here the Conqueſt is but in nature of a poſſeſſory Action, to put the Conquerour in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of a primer Right, and not to raiſe a new Title; for War begins where the Law fails: <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi Judicia deficiunt incipit Bellum.</hi> Lib. 2. cap. 1. And thus, upon the matter, I cannot find in <hi>Grotius</hi>'s Book <hi>De Jure Belli,</hi> how that any Caſe can be put wherein <hi>by a juſt War a man may become a King,</hi> pleno Jure Proprietatis.</p>
                  <p>All Government and Supreme Power is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon publick Subjection, which is thus defined by <hi>Grotius. Publica Subjectio eſt, quâ ſe Populus homini alicui, aut pluribus hominibus, aut etiam po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulo alteri in ditionem dat.</hi> Lib. 2. cap. 5. If Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be the Gift of the People, how can Supreme Power, <hi>pleno Jure,</hi> in full Right, be got by a juſt War?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="230" facs="tcp:93433:134"/>As to the other means whereby Kings may get Supreme Power in full Right of Propriety, <hi>Grotius</hi> will have it to be, <hi>when ſome People, for avoiding a greater Evil, do ſo yield themſelves into anothers Power, as that they do except nothing.</hi> It would be conſidered how, without War, any People can be brought into ſuch danger of life, as that becauſe they can find no other ways to defend themſelves, or becauſe they are ſo preſſed with poverty, as they cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have means to ſuſtain themſelves, they are forced to renounce all Right of Governing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and deliver it to a King.</p>
                  <p>But if ſuch a Caſe cannot happen, but by a War only, which reduceth a People to ſuch terms of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, as compels them to an abſolute Abrenun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of all Sovereignty: then War, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that neceſſity, is the prime means of extorting ſuch Soveraignty, and not the free Gift of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who cannot otherwiſe chuſe but give away that Power which they cannot keep.</p>
                  <p>Thus, upon the reckoning, the two ways pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by <hi>Grotius,</hi> are but one way; and that one way, in concluſion, is no way whereby Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power may be had in full Right of Propriety. His two ways are, a <hi>Juſt War,</hi> or a <hi>Donation of the People</hi>; a juſt War cannot be without a Title, no Title without the Donation of the People, no Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation without ſuch a Neceſſity as nothing can bring upon the Donors but a War. So that howſoever <hi>Grotius</hi> in words acknowledges that Kings may have a full Right of Propriety, yet by conſequence he denies it, by ſuch circular Suppoſitions, as by coincidence deſtroy each other, and in effect he
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:93433:134"/>
leaves all People a Right to plead in Bar againſt the Right of Propriety of any Prince, either <hi>per minas,</hi> or <hi>per dures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many times, ſaith <hi>Grotius,</hi> it happens, that War is grounded upon <hi>Expletive Juſtice, Juſtitiam Exple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricem,</hi> which is, <hi>when a man cannot obtain what he ought, he takes that which is as much in value, which in moral Eſtimation is the ſame.</hi> For in War, when the ſame Province cannot be recovered, to the which a man hath a Title, he recovers another of the like value. This recovery cannot give a full Right of Propriety: becauſe the Juſtice of ſuch a War reacheth no farther than to a compenſation for a former Right to another thing, and therefore can give no new Right.</p>
                  <p>I am bound to take notice of a Caſe put by <hi>Grotius,</hi> amongſt thoſe Cauſes which he thinks ſhould move the People to renounce all their Right of Governing, and give it to another. <hi>It may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo happen</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that a Father of a Family poſſeſſing large Territories, will not receive any man to dwell within his Land upon any other condition.</hi> And in another place, he ſaith, That <hi>all Kings are not made by the People, which may be ſufficiently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the Example of a Father of a Family receiving Strangers under the Law of Obedience.</hi> In both theſe paſſages we have a cloſe and curt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, That <hi>a Father of a Family may be an abſolute King over Strangers, without Choice of the People</hi>; now I would know whether ſuch Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of Families have not the ſame abſolute Power over their own Children, without the Peoples Choice, which he allows them over Strangers:
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:93433:135"/>
if they have, I cannot but call them Abſolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietary Kings, though <hi>Grotius</hi> be not willing to give them that Title in plain terms: for indeed to allow ſuch Kings, were to condemn his own Principle, That <hi>Dominion came in by the Will of the People</hi>; and ſo conſequently to overthrow his <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſufructuary Kings,</hi> of whom I am next to ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Grotius</hi> ſaith, That <hi>the Law of Obeying, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting Princes, depends upon the Will of them who firſt met in Civil Society, from whom Power doth flow to Kings.</hi> And, That <hi>men of their own accord came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into Civil Society, from whence ſprings Civil Power, and the People may chuſe what Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they pleaſe.</hi> Upon theſe Suppoſitions, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, That Kings, elected by the People, have but an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſufructuary Right</hi>; that is, a Right to take the profit or fruit of the Kingdom, but not a Right of Propriety or Power to alienate it. But why doth he call it an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſufructuary Right?</hi> It ſeems to me a term too mean or baſe to expreſs the Right of any King, and is derogatory to the Dignity of Supreme Majeſty. The word <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſufructuary</hi> is uſed by the Lawyers, to ſignifie him that hath the Uſe, Profit, or Fruit of ſome Corporal thing, that may be uſed without the Property; for of <hi>fungi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things (res fungibles,</hi> the <hi>Civilians</hi> call them) that are ſpent or conſumed in the Uſe, as Corn, Wine, Oyl, Money, there cannot be an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſufructuary Right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is to make a Kingdom all one with a Farm, as if it had no other Uſe but to be let out to him that can make moſt of it: whereas, in truth, it is
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:93433:135"/>
the part and Duty of a King to govern, and he hath a Right ſo to do, and to that end Supreme Power is given unto him; the taking of the profit, or making uſe of the Patrimony of the Crown, is but as a means only to enable him to perform that work of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, <hi>Grotius</hi> will not only have an elected King, but alſo his lawful Succeſſors, to have but an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſufructuary Right,</hi> ſo that though a King hath a Crown to him and to his Heirs, yet he will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him no Propriety, becauſe he hath no power to alienate it; for he ſuppoſeth the primary VVill of the People to have been to beſtow Supreme Power to go in Succeſſion, and not to be alienable; but for this he hath no better proof than a naked preſumption: <hi>In Regnis quae Populi voluntate delatâ ſunt, concedo non eſſe praeſumendum eam fuiſſe Populi voluntatem, aut alienatio Imperii ſui Regi permitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But though he will not allow Kings a Right of Propriety in their Kingdoms, yet a Right of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety there muſt be in ſome body, and in whom but in the People? For he ſaith, <hi>The Empire which is exerciſed by Kings, doth not ceaſe to be the Empire of the People.</hi> His meaning is, the Uſe is the King's, but the Property is the Peoples.</p>
                  <p>But if the Power to alienate the Kingdom be in him that hath the Property, this may prove a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Doctrine to the People: but yet to allow a Right of Succeſſion in Kings, and ſtill to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a Right of Property in the People, may make ſome contradiction: for the Succeſſion muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hinder the Right of Alienation which is in the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:93433:136"/>
People, or the Alienation muſt deſtroy that Right of Succeſſion, which, by <hi>Grotius</hi>'s confeſſion, may attend upon elected Kings.</p>
                  <p>Though <hi>Grotius</hi> confeſs, that Supreme Power be <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num quiddam, and in it ſelf indiviſible,</hi> ye he bſaith, <hi>Sometimes it may be divided either by parts po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential, or ſubjunctive.</hi> I take his meaning to be, that the Government or the Governed may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided: an Example he gives of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, which was divided into the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West:</hi> but whereas he ſaith, <hi>Fieri potest,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It may be, the People chuſing a King, may reſerve ſome Actions to themſelves, and in others they may give full power to the King.</hi> The Example he brings out of <hi>Plato</hi> of the <hi>Heraclides</hi> doth not prove it, and it is to dream of ſuch a Form of Government as never yet had name, nor was ever found in any ſetled Kingdom, nor cannot poſſibly be without ſtrange Confuſion.</p>
                  <p>If it were a thing ſo voluntary, and at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of men, when they were free, to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under Subjection, why may they not as vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily leave Subjection when they pleaſe, and be free again? If they had a liberty to change their Natural Freedom into a voluntary Subjection, there is ſtronger reaſon that they may change their voluntary Subjection into natural Freedom, ſince it is as lawful for men to alter their Wills as their Judgments.</p>
                  <p>Certainly it was a rare felicity, that all the men in the World at one inſtant of time ſhould agree together in one mind, to change the Natural Community of all things into private Dominion:
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:93433:136"/>
for without ſuch an unanimous Conſent, it was not poſſible for Community to be altered: for if but one man in the World had diſſented, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration had been unjuſt, becauſe that Man by the Law of Nature had a Right to the common Uſe of all things in the World; ſo that to have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a propriety of any one thing to any other, had been to have robbed him of his Right to the common Uſe of all things. And of this Judgment the Jeſuit <hi>Lud. Molina</hi> ſeems to be in his Book <hi>De Juſtitia,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>Si aliquis de cohabitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If one of the Neighbours will not give his Conſent to it, the Commonwealth ſhould have no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over him, becauſe then every other man hath no Right or Authority over him, and therefore can they not give Authority to the Commonwealth over him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If our firſt Parents, or ſome other of our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers did voluntarily bring in Propriety of Goods, and Subjection to Governours, and it were in their power either to bring them in or not, or having brought them in, to alter their minds, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore them to their firſt condition of Community and Liberty; what reaſon can there be alledged that men that now live ſhould not have the ſame power? So that if any one man in the World, be he never ſo mean or baſe, will but alter his Will, and ſay, he will reſume his Natural Right to Community, and be reſtored unto his Natural Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and conſequently take what he pleaſe, and do what he liſt; who can ſay that ſuch a man doth more than by Right he may? And then it will be lawful for every man, when he pleaſe,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:93433:137"/>
to diſſolve all Government, and deſtroy all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.</p>
                  <p>VVhereas <hi>Grotius</hi> ſaith, <hi>That by the Law of Nature all things were at firſt Common</hi>; and yet teacheth, That <hi>after Propriety was brought in, it was againſt the Law of Nature to uſe Community</hi>; he doth thereby not only make the Law of Nature changeable, which he ſaith God cannot do, but he alſo makes the Law of Nature contrary to it ſelf.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Obſervations</hi> reach only to the first Part of
<pb facs="tcp:93433:138"/>
the Treatiſe, concerning <hi>Monarchy in general,</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it can poſſibly be <hi>Limited</hi> or <hi>Mixed</hi>? If this be not made good, it is but vain labour to trouble the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> with the diſpute about the nature, kinds, and cauſes of that which is not, nor cannot at all be; or to handle the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> about this <hi>particular Monarchy,</hi> for which the prime and chief Arguments are of no greater <hi>Antiquity</hi> than ſome <hi>Conceſſions</hi> ſince theſe preſent Troubles.</p>
                  <p>The ancient Doctrine of <hi>Government</hi> in theſe later days hath been ſtrangely refined by the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> and wonderfully improved ſince the <hi>Reformation,</hi> eſpecially in point of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> by an Opinion, That the People have Originally a power to create <hi>ſeveral ſorts</hi> of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and to <hi>limit</hi> and <hi>compound</hi> them at their pleaſure.

                  <p>The Novelty of this Point challengeth a modeſt <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate;</hi> the rather, for that the <hi>Treatiſe</hi> acknowledgeth, that not only <hi>Monarchy,</hi> but alſo <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> and <hi>Democracy,</hi> may be either <hi>Simple,</hi> or <hi>Mixed</hi> of two or all three together, though it do not determine whether they can be <hi>Abſolute</hi> or <hi>Limited.</hi>

                  <head>THE PREFACE</head>
                  <p>WE do but flatter our ſelves, if we hope ever to be governed without an Arbitrary Power. No: we miſtake, the Queſtion is not, Whether there ſhall be an Arbitrary Power; but the only point is, Who ſhall have that Arbitrary Power, whether one man or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? There never was, nor ever can be any People governed without a Power of making Laws, and every Power of making Laws must be Arbitrary: For to make a Law according to Law, is <hi>Contradictio in adjecto.</hi> It is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally confeſſed, That in a Democracy the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme or Arbitrary Power of making Laws is in a Multitude; and ſo in an Ariſtocracy the like Legiſlative or Arbitrary Power is in a few, or in the Nobility. And therefore by a neceſſary Conſequence, in a Monarchy the ſame Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power muſt be in one; according to the Rule of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>Government is
<pb facs="tcp:93433:139"/>
in One, or in a Few, or in Many.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ancient Doctrine of Government, in theſe latter days, hath been ſtrangely refined by the Romaniſts, and wonderfully improved ſince the Reformation, eſpecially in point of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, by an Opinion, <hi>That the People have Originally a Power to create ſeveral ſorts of Monarchy, to limit and compound them with other Forms of Government, at their pleaſure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for this natural Power of the People, they find neither Scripture, Reaſon, or Practice to juſtifie it: For though ſeveral Kingdoms have ſeveral and diſtinct Laws one from another; yet that doth not make ſeveral ſorts of Monarchy: Nor doth the difference of obtaining the Supreme Power, whether by Conqueſt, Election, Succeſſion, or by any other way, make different ſorts of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. It is the difference only of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the Laws, and not of the Laws them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that alters the Form of Government; that is, whether one man, or more than one, make the Laws.</p>
                  <p>Since the growth of this new Doctrine, <hi>Of the Limitation and Mixture of Monarchy,</hi> it is moſt apparent, that <hi>Monarchy</hi> hath been crucified (as it were) between two Thieves, the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>People;</hi> for what <hi>Principles</hi> the <hi>Papiſts</hi> make uſe of for the Power of the <hi>Pope</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:93433:139"/>
above Kings, the very ſame, by blotting out the word <hi>Pope,</hi> and putting in the word <hi>People,</hi> the <hi>Plebiſts</hi> take up to uſe againſt their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns.</p>
                  <p>If we would truly know what <hi>Popery</hi> is, we ſhall find by the Laws and Statutes of the Realm, that the main, and indeed the only Point of <hi>Popery, is the alienating and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of Subjects from their Obedience to their Prince, to raiſe Sedition and Rebellion:</hi> If <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Popularity</hi> agree in this point, the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> that have ſhaken off the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> have made no great bargain of it, if in place of one Lord abroad, they get many Lords at home within their own Kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but reverence that Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which was allowed and made uſe of for God's own People, and for all other Nations. It were impiety, to think that God, who was careful to appoint Judicial Laws for his choſen People, would not furniſh them with the best Form of Government: or to imagine, that the Rules given in divers places in the Goſpel, by our bleſſed Saviour and his Apoſtles, for Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Kings, ſhould now, like Almanacks out of date, be of no uſe to us; becauſe it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, <hi>We have a Form of Government now,</hi> not once thought of in thoſe days. It is
<pb facs="tcp:93433:140"/>

                  <head>THE ANARCHY Of a Limited or Mixed MONARCHY.</head>
                  <p>THere is ſcarce the meaneſt man of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, but can now in theſe days tell us, That the Government <hi>of the Kingdom of</hi> England <hi>is a</hi> LIMITED <hi>and</hi> MIXED <hi>Monarchy:</hi> And it is no marvel, ſince all the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes and Arguments of theſe diſtracted Times both from the Pulpit and Preſs do tend and end in this Concluſion.</p>
                  <p>The Author of the Treatiſe of Monarchy hath copiouſly handled the nature and manner of <hi>Limited</hi> and <hi>Mixed</hi> Monarchy, and is the firſt and only man (that I know) hath undertaken the task of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing it; others only mention it, as taking it for granted.</p>

                  <p>I have with ſome diligence looked over this Treatiſe, but cannot approve of theſe diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which he propounds; I ſubmit the reaſons of my diſlike to others judgments. I am ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what confident that his Doctrine of <hi>Limited and Mixed Monarchy</hi> is an opinion but of yeſterday, and of no antiquity, a me<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> innovation in Policy, not ſo old as <hi>New England,</hi> though calculated pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly for that Meridian. For in his firſt part of the Treatiſe which concerns Monarchy in general, there is not one proof, text, or example in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that he hath produced to juſtifie his conceit of <hi>Limited</hi> and <hi>Mixed</hi> Monarchy. Neither doth he afford us ſo much as one paſſage or reaſon out of <hi>Ariſtole,</hi> whoſe Books of <hi>Politicks,</hi> and whoſe natural reaſons are of greateſt authority and credit with all rational men, next to the ſacred Scripture: Nay, I hope I may affirm, and be able to prove, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> doth confute both <hi>limited</hi> and <hi>mixed</hi> Monarchy,<note rend="inter">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 6.</note> howſoever Doctor <hi>Ferne</hi> think theſe new opinions to be raiſed upon <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotles</hi> Principles. As for other Politicians or Hiſtorians, either divine or humane, ancient or modern, our Author brings not one to confirm his opinions; nor doth he, nor can he ſhew that ever any Nation or People were governed by a <hi>limited</hi> or <hi>mixed</hi> Monarchy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Machiavel</hi> is the firſt in Chriſtendom that I can find that writ of a <hi>Mixed Government,</hi> but not one ſyllable of a <hi>Mixed Monarchy:</hi> he, in his diſcourſes or diſputations upon the Decades of <hi>Livy,</hi> falls ſo
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:93433:141"/>
enamored with the <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth, that he thought he could never ſufficiently grace that popular Government, unleſs he ſaid, there was ſomething of Monarchy in it: yet he was never ſo impudent as to ſay, it was a <hi>mixed</hi> Monarchy. And what <hi>Machiavel</hi> hath ſaid for <hi>Rome,</hi> the like hath <hi>Contarene</hi> for <hi>Venice.</hi> But <hi>Bodin</hi> hath laid open the errours of both theſe, as alſo of <hi>Polybius,</hi> and ſome few others that held the like opinions. As for the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> if it hath found out a Form of Government (as the Treatiſe layeth it down) of ſuch perfection as never any people could; it is both a glory to the Nation, and alſo to this Author, who hath firſt decipher'd it.</p>
                  <p>I now make my approach to the Book it ſelf: The Title is, <hi>A Treatiſe of Monarchy.</hi> The firſt part of it is, <hi>Of Monarchy in general:</hi> Where firſt, I charge the Author, that he hath not given us any definition or deſcription of Monarchy in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral: for by the rules of method he ſhould have firſt defined, and then divided: for if there be ſeveral ſorts of Monarchy, then in ſomething they muſt agree, which makes them to be Monarchies; and in ſomething they muſt diſagree and differ, which makes them to be ſeveral ſorts of Monarchies. In the firſt place he ſhould have ſhewed us in what they all agreed, which muſt have been a definition of Monarchy in general, which is the foundation of the Treatiſe; and except that be agreed upon, we ſhall argue upon we know not what. I preſs not this main omiſſion of our Author out of any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of wrangling; but becauſe I am confident that had he pitched upon any definition of Monarchy in
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:93433:142"/>
general, his own definition would have confuted his whole Treatiſe. Beſides, I find him pleaſed to give us a handſom definition of <hi>Abſolute Monarchy,</hi> from whence I may infer, that he knew no other definition that would have fitted all his other ſorts of Monarchy; it concerned him to have produced it, leſt it might be thought there could be no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy but Abſolute.</p>
                  <p>What our Author hath omitted, I ſhall attempt to ſupply, and leave to the ſcanning. And it ſhall be a real as well as nominal definition of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. <hi>A Monarchy is the Government of one alone.</hi> For the better credit of this definition, though it be able to maintain it ſelf, yet I ſhall deduce it from the Principles of our Author of the Treatiſe of Monarchy.</p>
                  <p>We all know that this word <hi>Monarch</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of two Greek words, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:93433:142"/>
both ſupreme, and yet one chief: the like diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction he hath before, where he ſaith, <hi>The power of Magiſtracy, in reſpect of its degrees,</hi>

                     <hi>is Nomothetical or Architectonical</hi>; and <hi>Guber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native or Executive:</hi> by theſe words of <hi>Legiſlative, Nomothetical,</hi> and <hi>Architectonical</hi> Power, in plain Engliſh, he underſtands <hi>a power of making Laws</hi>; and by <hi>Gubernative</hi> and <hi>Executive,</hi> a <hi>power of putting thoſe Laws in execution, by judging and puniſhing offenders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reſult we have from hence is, That by the Authors acknowledgment, every Monarch muſt have the ſupreme Power, and that ſupreme Power is, a power to make Laws: and howſoever the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor makes the Gubernative and Executive power a part of the ſupreme Power; yet he confeſſeth <hi>the Legiſlative to be chief, or the higheſt degree of power,</hi> for he doth acknowledge degrees of ſupreme Power; nay, he afterwards teacheth us, That <hi>the Legiſlative power is the height of power,</hi>

                  <p>Now let us examine the Authors <hi>Limited Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch</hi> by theſe his own rules; he tells us, That <hi>in a moderated, limited, stinted,</hi>

And if by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of ſuch Law only he muſt govern, where is the Legiſlative power, which is the chief of ſupreme Power?

                  </p>
                  <p>Now let us ſee if his mixed Monarchy be framed according to theſe his own Principles.

                        <hi>P.</hi> 5.</note> 
                     <hi>for it is one ſimple thing, or indiviſible beam of Divine perfection:</hi> but he can make this indiviſible beam to be diviſible into three ſhares. I have done with the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>ſolus, alone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have dwelt the longer upon this definition of Monarchy, becauſe the apprehending of it out of the Authors own grounds quite overthrows both his <hi>Monarch limited by Law,</hi> and <hi>his Monarch mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the States.</hi> For to Govern, is to give a Law to others, and not to have a Law given to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern and limit him that governs: And to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern alone, is not to have ſharers or Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons mixed with the Governour. Thus the two words of which Monarchy is compounded, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the two ſorts of Monarchy which he pleads for, and by conſequence his whole Treatiſe: for theſe two ſorts of <hi>limited</hi> and <hi>mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>

                     <note rend="inter">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 2.</note>Our Author firſt confeſſeth, <hi>It is Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Ordinance there ſhould be Government,</hi> and he proves it by <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16. where God ordained <hi>Adam to rule over his wife, and her deſires were to be ſubject to his</hi>; and as hers, ſo all theirs that ſhould come of her. Here we have the original grant of Government, and the fountain of all power placed in the <hi>Father</hi> of all Mankind; accordingly we find the <hi>Law</hi> for obedience to Government given in the terms of <hi>honour thy Father</hi>: not only the conſtitution of Power in general, but the limitation of it to one kind (that is, to Monarchy, or the Government of one alone) and the determination of it to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual perſon and line of <hi>Adam,</hi> are all three Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God. Neither <hi>Eve</hi> nor her Children could either limit <hi>Adams</hi> power, or joyn others with him in the Government; and what was given unto <hi>Adam,</hi> was given in his perſon to his poſterity. This paternal Power continued Monarchical to the Flood, and after the Flood to the confuſion of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel:</hi> when Kingdoms were firſt erected, planted, or ſcattered over the face of the World, we find <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.11. it was done by Colonies of whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, over which the prime Fathers had ſupreme power, and were Kings, who were all the Sons or Grand-children of <hi>Noah,</hi> from whom they derived a fatherly and regal Power over their Families. Now if this ſupreme Power was ſetled and founded by God himſelf in the Fatherhood, how is it poſſible for the people to have any right or title to alter and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:93433:144"/>
diſpoſe of it otherwiſe? What Commiſſion can they ſhew that gives them power either of <hi>Limitation</hi> or <hi>Mixture?</hi> It was God's Ordinance, that Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy ſhould be unlimited in <hi>Adam,</hi> and as large as all the acts of his will: and as in him, ſo in all others that have ſupreme Power, as appears by the judgment and ſpeech of the people to <hi>Joſhuah</hi> when he was ſupreme Governour, theſe are their words to him, <hi>All that thou commandeſt us we will do; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandeſt him, he ſhall be put to death:</hi> We may not ſay, that theſe were evil Councellours or flattering Courtiers of <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> or that he himſelf was a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for having ſuch arbitrary power. Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and all thoſe who affirm, that <hi>power is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to perſons by publick conſent,</hi> are forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that it is the fatherly power that firſt enables a people to make ſuch conveyance; ſo that admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting (as they hold) that our Anceſtors did at firſt convey power, yet the reaſon why we now living do ſubmit to ſuch power, is, for that our Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers every one for himſelf, his family, and poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, had a power of reſigning up themſelves and us to a ſupreme Power. As the Scripture teacheth us, That <hi>ſupreme Power was originally in the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood without any limitation,</hi> ſo likewiſe Reaſon doth evince it, that if God ordained that Supremacy ſhould be, that then Supremacy muſt of neceſſity be unlimited: for the power that limits muſt be above that power which is limited; if it be limited, it cannot be ſupreme: ſo that if our Author will grant ſupreme Power to be the Ordinance of God, the ſupreme Power will prove it ſelf to be unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:93433:145"/>
by the ſame Ordinance, becauſe a ſupreme limited Power is a contradiction.</p>
                  <p>The Monarchical Power of <hi>Adam</hi> the Father of all fleſh, being by a general binding Ordinance ſetled by God in him and his poſterity by right of fatherhood, the form of Monarchy muſt be preferred above other forms, except the like Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance for other forms can be ſhewed: neither <hi>may men according to their relations to the form they live under, to their affections and judgments in divers reſpects, prefer or compare any other form with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</hi> The point that moſt perplexeth our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and many others, is, that if Monarchy be allowed to be the Ordinance of God, <hi>an abſurdity would follow, that we ſhould uncharitably condemn all the Communities which have not that form, for violation of Gods Ordinance, and pronounce thoſe other Powers unlawful.</hi> If thoſe who live under a Monarchy can juſtifie the form they live under to be Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, they are not bound to forbear their own juſtification, becauſe others cannot do the like for the form they live under; let others look to the defence of their own Government: if it cannot be proved or ſhewed that any other form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had ever any lawful beginning, but was brought in or erected by Rebellion, muſt therefore the lawful and juſt obedience to Monarchy be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to be the Ordinance of God?</p>
                  <p>To proceed with our Author; in the 3<hi>d. page</hi> he ſaith, <hi>The Higher Power is Gods Ordinance: That it reſideth in One or more, in ſuch or ſuch a way, is from humane deſignment; God by no word binds any people to this or that form, till they by their own act bind themſelves.</hi> Becauſe the power and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:93433:145"/>
of the People in Government is the burden of the whole Book, and our Author expects it ſhould be admitted as a magiſterial poſtulation, without any other proof than a naked ſuppoſition; and ſince others alſo maintain that <hi>originally Power was, or now is in the People,</hi> and that <hi>the firſt Kings were choſen by the People:</hi> they may not be offended, if they be asked in what ſence they underſtand the word [<hi>People</hi>] be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this, as many other words, hath different ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, being ſometimes taken in a larger, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while in a ſtricter ſence. Literally, and in the largeſt ſence, the word <hi>People</hi> ſignifies the <hi>whole mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of mankind</hi>; but <hi>figuratively</hi> and <hi>ſynecdochical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> it notes many times the <hi>major part</hi> of a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, or ſometimes the <hi>better,</hi> or the <hi>richer,</hi> or the <hi>wiſer,</hi> or ſome other part; and oftentimes a very ſmall part of the People, if there be no other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent oppoſite party, hath the name of the People <hi>by preſumption.</hi>

                  <p>If they underſtand that the entire multitude or whole People have originally by nature Power to chuſe a King, they muſt remember, that by their own principles and rules, by nature all mankind in the World makes but one People, who they ſuppoſe to be born alike to an equal freedom from Subjection; and where ſuch freedom is, there all things muſt of neceſſity be common: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without a joynt conſent of the whole People of the World, no one thing can be made proper to any one man, but it will be an injury, and an uſurpation upon the Common right of all others. From whence it follows, that natural <hi>freedom</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once granted, there cannot be any one man choſen a King without the univerſal conſent of all
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:93433:146"/>
the People of the world at one inſtant, <hi>nemine contradicente.</hi> Nay, if it be true that <hi>nature</hi> hath made all men free; though all mankind ſhould concur in one vote, yet it cannot ſeem reaſonable, that they ſhould have power to alter the law of nature; for if no man have power to take away his own life without the guilt of being a murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of himſelf, how can any people confer ſuch a power as they have not themſelves upon any one man, without being acceſſories to their own deaths, and every particular man become guilty of being <hi>felo de ſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If this general ſignification of the word <hi>People</hi> be diſavowed, and men will ſuppoſe that the <hi>People</hi> of particular Regions or Countries have power and freedom to chuſe unto themſelves Kings; then let them but obſerve the conſequence: Since na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath not diſtinguiſhed the habitable World into Kingdoms, nor determined what part of a <hi>People</hi> ſhall belong to one Kingdom, and what to another, it follows, that the original freedom of mankind being ſuppoſed, every man is at liberty to be of what Kingdom he pleaſe, and ſo every petty company hath a Right to make a Kingdom by it ſelf; and not only every City, but every Village, and every Family, nay and every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man, a liberty to chuſe himſelf to be his own King if he pleaſe; and he were a madman that being by nature free, would chuſe any man but himſelf to be his own Governour. Thus to avoid the having but of one King of the whole world, we ſhall run into a liberty of having as many Kings as there be men in the world, which upon the matter, is to have no King at all, but to leave
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:93433:146"/>
all men to their natural liberty, which is the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief the Pleaders for <hi>natural liberty</hi> do pretend they would moſt avoid.</p>
                  <p>But if neither the whole people of the world, nor the whole people of any part of the world be meant, but only the <hi>major part,</hi> or ſome other part of a part of the world; yet ſtill the objection will be the ſtronger. For beſides that nature hath made no partition of the world, or of the people into diſtinct Kingdoms, and that without an univerſal conſent at one and the ſame inſtant no partition can be made: yet if it were lawful for particular parts of the world by conſent to chuſe their Kings, nevertheleſs their elections would bind none to ſubjection but only ſuch as conſented; for the <hi>major part</hi> never binds, but where men at firſt either agree to be ſo bound, or where a higher power ſo commands: Now there being no higher power than nature, but God himſelf; where neither nature nor God appoints the <hi>major part</hi> to bind, there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is not binding to any but only to themſelves who conſent.</p>
                  <p>Yet, for the preſent to gratifie them ſo far as to admit that either by nature, or by a general conſent of all mankind, the world at firſt was divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to particular Kingdoms, and the <hi>major part</hi> of the people of each Kingdom aſſembled, allowed to chuſe their King: yet it cannot truly be ſaid that ever the <hi>whole people,</hi> or the <hi>major part,</hi> or indeed any conſiderable part of the whole people of any Nation ever aſſembled to any ſuch purpoſe. For except by ſome ſecret miraculous inſtinct they ſhould all meet at one time, and place, what one man, or company of men leſs than the whole
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:93433:147"/>
people hath power to appoint either time or place of elections, where all be alike <hi>free by nature?</hi> and without a lawful ſummons, it is moſt unjuſt to bind thoſe that be abſent. The whole People cannot ſummon it ſelf; one man is ſick, another is lame, a third is aged, and a fourth is under age of diſcretion: all theſe at ſome time or other, or at ſome place or other, might be able to meet, if they might chuſe their own time and place, as men naturally free ſhould.</p>
                  <p>In Aſſemblies that are by humane politique con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, the ſuperior power that ordains ſuch aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, can regulate and confine them, both for time, place, perſons, and other circumſtances: but where there is an equality by nature, there can be no ſuperior power; there every Infant at the hour it is born in, hath a like intereſt with the greateſt and wiſeſt man in the World. Mankind is like the ſea, ever ebbing or flowing, every minute one is born, another dies; thoſe that are the People this minute, are not the People the next minute, in every inſtant and point of time there is a variation: no one time can be indifferent for all mankind to aſſemble; it cannot but be miſchievous always at the leaſt to all Infants, and others under age of diſcretion; not to ſpeak of Women, eſpecially Virgins, who by birth have as much <hi>natural freedom</hi> as any other, and therefore ought not to loſe their liberty without their own conſent.</p>
                  <p>But in part to ſalve this, it will be ſaid that Infants and Children may be concluded by the votes of their Parents. This remedy may cure ſome part of the miſchief, but it deſtroys the whole cauſe, and at laſt ſtumbles upon the true
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:93433:147"/>
original of Government. For if it be allowed, that the acts of Parents bind the Children, then farewel the Doctrine of the <hi>natural freedom of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</hi>; where Subjection of Children to Parents is natural, there can be no natural freedom. If any reply, that not all Children ſhall be bound by their Parents conſent, but only thoſe that are under age: It muſt be conſidered, that in nature there is no <hi>nonage</hi>; if a man be not born free, ſhe doth not aſſign him any other time when he ſhall attain his freedom: or if ſhe did, then Children attaining that age, ſhould be diſcharged of their Parents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. So that in concluſion, if it be imagined that the People were ever but once free from Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection by nature, it will prove a meer impoſſibility ever lawfully to introduce any kind of government whatſoever, without apparent wrong to a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of People.</p>
                  <p>It is further obſervable, that ordinarily Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants are far a greater number than Parents and Maſters; and for the major part of theſe to be able to vote and appoint what Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Governours their Fathers and Maſters ſhall be ſubject unto, is moſt unnatural, and in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to give the Children the government over their Parents.</p>
                  <p>To all this it may be oppoſed, What need diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute how a People can chuſe a King, ſince there be multitude of examples that Kings have been, and are now adays choſen by their People? The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, 1. The queſtion is not of the <hi>fact,</hi> but of the <hi>right,</hi> whether it have been done by a <hi>natural,</hi> or by an <hi>uſurped</hi> right. 2. Many Kings are, and have been choſen by ſome ſmall part of a
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:93433:148"/>
people; but by <hi>the whole,</hi> or <hi>major part</hi> of a Kingdom not any at all. Moſt have been elected by the Nobility, Great men, and Princes of the blood, as in <hi>Poland, Denmark,</hi> and in <hi>Sweden</hi>; not by any <hi>collective</hi> or <hi>repreſentative</hi> body of any Nation: ſometimes a factious or ſeditious City, or a mutinous Army hath ſet up a King, but none of all thoſe could ever prove they had <hi>Right</hi> or juſt title either by <hi>Nature,</hi> or any otherwiſe, for ſuch elections. We may reſolve upon theſe two propoſitions: 1. <hi>That the people have no power or right of themſelves to chuſe Kings.</hi> 2. <hi>If they had any ſuch right, it is not poſſible for them any way lawfully to exerciſe it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You will ſay, <hi>There muſt neceſſarily be a right in ſome body to elect, in caſe a King die without an Heir.</hi> I anſwer, <hi>No King can die without an Heir, as long as there is any one man living in the world.</hi> It may be the Heir may be unknown to the people; but that is no fault in nature, but the negligence or ignorance of thoſe whom it concerns. But if a King could die without an Heir, yet the Kingly power in that caſe ſhall not eſcheat to the whole people, but to the ſupream Heads and Fathers of Families; not as they are the <hi>people,</hi> but <hi>quatenus</hi> they are Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of people, over whom they have a ſupream power devolved unto them after the death of their ſoveraign Anceſtor: and if any can have a right to chuſe a King, it muſt be theſe Fathers, by confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their diſtinct fatherly powers upon one man alone. Chief Fathers in Scripture are accounted as all the people, as <hi>all the Children of Iſrael,</hi> as <hi>all the Congregation,</hi> as the Text plainly expounds it ſelf, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 1.2. where <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks to <hi>All
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:93433:148"/>
Iſrael,</hi> that is, <hi>to the Captains, the Judges, and to every Governour, the</hi> CHIEF OF THE FATHERS: and ſo the <hi>Elders of Iſrael</hi> are expounded to be <hi>the chief of the Fathers of the Children of Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.1. and the 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 5.2.</p>
                  <p>If it be objected, That Kings are not now (as they were at the firſt planting or peopling of the world) the Fathers of their People or Kingdoms, and that the fatherhood hath loſt the right of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning; An anſwer is, That all Kings that now are, or ever were, are, or were either Fathers of their People, or the Heirs of ſuch Fathers, or Uſurpers of the right of ſuch Fathers. It is a truth undeniable, that there cannot be any multitude of men whatſoever, either great, or ſmall, though gathered together from the ſeveral corners and remoteſt regions of the world, but that in the ſame multitude, conſidered by it ſelf, there is one man amongſt them that in nature hath a right to be the King of all the reſt, as being the next Heir to <hi>Adam,</hi> and all the other ſubject unto him: every man by nature is a King, or a Subject: the obedience which all Subjects yield to Kings, is but the paying of that duty which is due to the ſupream fatherhood: Many times by the act either of an Uſurper himſelf, or of thoſe that ſet him up, the true Heir of a Crown is diſpoſſeſſed, God uſing the miniſtry of the wickedeſt men for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving and ſetting up of Kings: in ſuch caſes the Subjects obedience to the fatherly power muſt go along and wait upon God's providence, who only hath right to give and take away King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and thereby to adopt Subjects into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of another fatherly power: according to
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:93433:149"/>
that of <hi>Ariſt. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>However the <hi>natural freedom of the People</hi> be cried us as the ſole means to determine the kind of Government and the Governours: yet in the cloſe, all the favourers of this opinion are conſtrained to grant that the obedience which is due to the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Power is the true only cauſe of the Subjection which we that are now living give to Kings, ſince none of us gave conſent to Government, but only our Fore-fathers act and conſent hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded us.</p>
                  <p>Whereas many confeſs that Government only in the <hi>abstract</hi> is the ordinance of God, they are not able to prove any ſuch ordinance in the Scripture, but only in the fatherly power, and therefore we find the Commandment that enjoyns obedience to Superiours, given in the terms of <hi>Honour thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> ſo that not only the <hi>Power or right of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> but the <hi>form of the power of governing,</hi> and <hi>the perſon having that power,</hi> are all the ordinance of God: the firſt Father had not only ſimply pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but power Monarchical, as he was a Father, immediately from God. For by the appointment of God, as ſoon as <hi>Adam</hi> was created he was Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of the World, though he had no Subjects; for though there could not be actual Government until there were Subjects, yet by the right of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it was due to <hi>Adam</hi> to be Governour of his poſterity: though not in <hi>Act,</hi> yet at leaſt in <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit. Adam</hi> was a King from his Creation: And in the ſtate of innocency he had been Governour of his Children; for the <hi>integrity</hi> or <hi>excellency</hi> of
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:93433:149"/>
the Subjects doth not take away the <hi>order</hi> or <hi>eminency</hi> of the Governour. <hi>Eve</hi> was ſubject to <hi>Adam</hi> before he ſinned; the Angels, who are of a pure nature, are ſubject to God: which confutes their ſaying who in diſgrace of civil Government or power ſay it was brought in by ſin: Government as to <hi>coactive power</hi> was after ſin, becauſe coaction ſuppoſeth ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, which was not in the ſtate of innocency: But as for <hi>directive power,</hi> the condition of humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture requires it, ſince civil Society cannot be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without power of Government: for although as long as men continued in the ſtate of innocency they might not need the direction of <hi>Adam</hi> in thoſe things which were <hi>neceſſarily</hi> and <hi>morally</hi> to be done; yet things <hi>indifferent,</hi> that depended meerly on their free will, might be directed by the power of <hi>Adam</hi>'s command.</p>
                  <p>If we conſider the firſt plantations of the world which were after the building of <hi>Babel</hi> when the confuſion of tongues was, we may find the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the Earth into diſtinct Kingdoms and Countries, by ſeveral families, whereof the Sons or Grand-children of <hi>Noah</hi> were the Kings or Governours by a fatherly right; and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of this power and right in the Fathers, God was pleaſed upon ſeveral Families to beſtow a Language on each by it ſelf, the better to unite it into a Nation or Kingdom; as appears by the words of the Text, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. <hi>Theſe are the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the Sons of</hi> Noah, <hi>after their generations in their Nations, and by theſe were the Nations divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Earth after the floud: Every one after</hi> HIS TONGUE, AFTER THEIR FAMILIES <hi>in their Nations.</hi>

                  <p>The Commons in Parliament are not the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative body of the whole Kingdom: they do not repreſent the King, who is the head and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal member of the Kingdom; nor do they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the Lords, who are the nobler and higher part of the body of the Realm, and are perſonally preſent in Parliament, and therefore need no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation.

All which are not one quarter, nay, not a tenth part of the Commons of the Kingdom; for in every Pariſh, for one Free-holder there may be found ten that are no Freeholders: and anciently before Rents were improved, there were nothing near ſo many Free-holders of 40 <hi>s.</hi> by the year as now are to be found.</p>
                  <p>The ſcope and Concluſion of this diſcourſe and Argument is, that the people taken in what notion or ſenſe ſoever, either <hi>diffuſively, collectively,</hi> or <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatively,</hi> have not, nor cannot exerciſe any right or power of their own by nature, either in chuſing or in regulating Kings.

                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning <hi>abſolute Monarchy,</hi> he grants, that <hi>ſuch were the ancient Eastern Monarchies, and that of the Turk and Perſian at this day.</hi> Herein he ſaith very true.

                  <p>Next it follows, that <hi>Abſolute Monarchy is, when a people are abſolutely reſigned up, or reſign up themſelves to be governed by the will of One man.

I do the rather mention theſe paſſages of our Author, becauſe very many in theſe days do not ſtick to maintain, that an arbitrary or Abſolute Monarch not limited by Law, is all one with a Tyrant; and to be governed by one man's will, is to be made a ſlave. It is a queſtion whether our Author be not of that mind, when he ſaith, <hi>abſolute ſubjection is ſervitude:</hi> and thereupon a late friend to limited Monarchy affirms in a diſcourſe upon the queſtion in debate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and Parliament,<note rend="inter">

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:93433:151"/>
certainly the man doth not know either what a Tyrant is, or what a Slave is: indeed the words are frequent enough in every mans mouth, and our old Engliſh Tranſlation of the Bible uſeth ſometimes the word <hi>Tyrant</hi>; but the Authors of our new Tranſlation have been ſo careful, as not once to uſe the word, but only for the proper name of a man, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.9. becauſe they find no Hebrew word in the Scripture to ſignifie a <hi>Tyrant</hi> or a <hi>Slave.</hi> Neither <hi>Ariſtotle, Bodin,</hi> nor Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> (who were all men of deep judgment) can agree in a definition or deſcription of Tyranny, though they have all three laboured in the point. And I make ſome queſtion whether any man can poſſibly deſcribe what a Tyrant is, and then tell me any one man that ever was in the World that was a Tyrant according to that deſcription.</p>

                     <item>3. <hi>Where he not only ſets a rule, but promiſeth in many caſes not to alter it; but this promiſe or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement is an after-condeſcent or act of grace, not diſſolving the abſolute Oath of Subjection which went before it.</hi>

the other two, though he ſay <hi>they be abſolute,</hi> yet in regard they ſet themſelves limits or Laws to govern by, if it pleaſe our Author to term them <hi>limited Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs,</hi> I will not oppoſe him; yet I muſt tell him, that his third degree of abſolute Monarchy is ſuch a kind, as I believe, never hath been, nor ever can be in the world. For a Monarch to promiſe and engage in many caſes not to <hi>alter a Law,</hi> it is moſt neceſſary that thoſe many caſes ſhould be particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed at the bargain-making. Now he that underſtands the nature and condition of all <hi>humane Laws,</hi> knows that particular caſes are infinite, and not comprehenſible within any rules or Laws: and if many caſes ſhould be comprehended, and many omitted, yet even thoſe that were comprehended would admit of variety of interpretations and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations; therefore our Author doth not, nor can tell us of any ſuch reſerved caſes promiſed by any Monarch.</p>
                  <p>Again, where he ſaith, <hi>An after-condeſcent or Act of grace doth not diſſolve the abſolute Oath of ſubjection which went before it</hi>; though in this he ſpeak true, yet ſtill he ſeems to inſinuate, that <hi>an Oath only binds to ſubjection,</hi> which Oath, as he would have us believe, was at firſt <hi>arbitrary:</hi> whereas Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are bound to obey Monarchs though they never <hi>take oath</hi> of <hi>ſubjection,</hi> as well as children are bound to obey their Parents, though they never ſwear to do it.</p>
                  <p>Next, his diſtinction between <hi>the rule of power,</hi>
                     <note rend="inter">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 7. <hi>P.</hi> 1.</note> 
                     <hi>and the exerciſe of it,</hi> is vain; for <hi>to rule,</hi> is <hi>to exerciſe</hi> power: for himſelf ſaith, that <hi>Government is</hi> poteſtatis exercitium, <hi>the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of a moral power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:93433:152"/>Laſtly, whereas our Author ſaith, <hi>a Monarch cannot break his promiſe without ſin</hi>; let me add, that if the ſafety of the people, <hi>ſalus populi,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a breach of the Monarchs promiſe, then the ſin, if there be any, is rather in the <hi>making,</hi> than <hi>breaking of the promiſe</hi>; the <hi>ſafety of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> is an exception implied in every Monarchical promiſe.</p>
                  <p>But it ſeems theſe three degrees of Monarchy do not ſatisfie our Author; he is not content to have a Monarch, have a Law or rule to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern by,<note rend="inter">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 12.</note> but he muſt have <hi>this limitation or Law to be</hi> ab externo, <hi>from ſome body elſe, and not from the determination of the Monarchs own will</hi>; and therefore he ſaith, <hi>By original conſtitution the Society publick confers on one man a power by limited contract, reſigning themſelves to be governed by ſuch a Law:</hi> alſo before he told us,<note rend="inter">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 13.</note> 
                     <hi>the ſole means of Soveraignty is the conſent and fundamental contract; which conſent puts them in their power, which can be no more nor other than is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to them by ſuch contract of ſubjection.</hi> If the ſole means of a limited Monarchy be the conſent and fundamental contract of a Nation, how is it that he ſaith, <hi>A Monarch may be limited by after-condeſcent?</hi> is an after-condeſcent <hi>all one</hi> with a fundamental contract, with original and radical conſtitution? why yea: he tells us <hi>it is a ſecondary original conſtitution</hi>; a ſecondary original, that is, <hi>a ſecond firſt:</hi> And if that condeſcent be an act of grace, doth not this condeſcent to a limitation come from the free determination of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs will? If he either <hi>formally, or virtually</hi> (as our Author ſuppoſeth) <hi>deſert his abſolute
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:93433:153"/>
or arbitrary power which he hath by conqueſt, or other right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if it be from the free will of the Monarch, why doth he ſay the limitation muſt be <hi>ab externo?</hi>
                     <note rend="inter">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 8.</note> He told us before, that <hi>Subjection cannot be diſſolved or leſſen'd by an Act of grace coming afterwards:</hi> but he hath better bethought himſelf, and now he will have <hi>Acts of grace to be of two kinds, and the latter kind may amount</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>to a reſignation of abſolute Monarchy.</hi> But can any man believe that a Monarch who by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt or other right hath an abſolute arbitrary power, will voluntarily reſign that abſoluteneſs, and accept ſo much power only as the People ſhall pleaſe to give him, and ſuch Laws to govern by as they ſhall make choice of? can he ſhew that ever any Monarch was ſo gracious or kind-hearted as to lay down his lawful power freely at his Subjects feet? Is it not ſufficient grace if ſuch an abſolute Monarch be content to ſet down a Law to himſelf by which he will ordinarily govern, but he muſt needs relinquiſh his old independent commiſſion, and take a new one from his Subjects, clog'd with limitations?</p>
                  <p>Finally, I obſerve, that howſoever our Author ſpeak big of the radical, fundamental, and original power of the People as the root of all Soveraignty: yet in a better mood he will take up, and be contented with a Monarchy limited by an after-condeſcent and act of grace from the Monarch himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have briefly touched his grounds of <hi>Limited Monarchy</hi>; if now we ſhall ask, what proof or examples he hath to juſtifie his Doctrine,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:93433:153"/>
he is as mute as a fiſh: only <hi>Pythagoras</hi> hath ſaid it, and we muſt believe him; for though our Author would have Monarchy to be limited, yet he could be content his opinion ſhould be abſolute, and not limited to any rule or example.</p>
                  <p>The main Charge I have againſt our Author now remains to be diſcuſſed; and it is this, That inſtead of a Treatiſe of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> he hath brought forth a Treatiſe of <hi>Anarchy,</hi> and that by his own confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhall be made good.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he holds, <hi>A limited Monarch tranſcends his bounds, if he commands beyond the Law; and the Subject legally is not bound to ſubjection in ſuch caſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if you ask the Author who ſhall be Judge, whether the Monarch tranſcend his bounds, and of the exceſſes of the Soveraign Power; His anſwer is,<note rend="inter">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 16.</note> 
                     <hi>There is an impoſſibility of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting a Judge to determine this laſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie— I conceive in a limited legal Monarchy there can be no ſtated internal Judge of the Monarchs actions,</hi>
                     <note rend="inter">P. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>if there grow a fundamental variance between him and the Community. There can be no Judge legal and conſtituted within that form of Government.</hi> In theſe anſwers it appears, there is no Judge to determine the Soveraigns or the Monarchs tranſgreſſing his fundamental li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits: yet our Author is very cautelous, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth only a fundamental variance betwixt the Monarch and the Community; he is aſhamed to put the queſtion home. I demand of him if there be a variance betwixt the Monarch and any of the meaneſt perſons of the Community, who ſhall be the Judge? For inſtance, <hi>The King commands me,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:93433:154"/>
or gives judgment againſt me:</hi> I reply, <hi>His commands are illegal, and his judgment not according to Law:</hi> Who muſt judge? <hi>If the Monarch himſelf judge, then you deſtroy the frame of the State, and make it abſolute,</hi> ſaith our Author; and he gives his reaſon: for, <hi>to confine a Monarch to a Law, and then to make him judge of his own deviaions from that Law, is to abſolve him from all Law.</hi> On the other ſide, <hi>if any, or all the people may judge, then you put the Soveraignty in the whole body, or part of it, and deſtroy the being of Monarchy.</hi> Thus our Author hath caught him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a plain <hi>Dilemma:</hi> If the King be Judge, then he is no limited Monarch; If the People be Judge, then he is no Monarch at all. So farewel <hi>limited Monarchy,</hi> nay farewel <hi>all Government,</hi> if there be no Judge.</p>
                  <p>Would you know what help our Author hath found out for this miſchief? Firſt, he ſaith, That <hi>a Subject is bound to yield to a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,</hi>

                        <hi>P.</hi> 17.</note> Again he ſaith, <hi>If the act in which the exorbitance or tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Monarch is ſuppoſed to be, be of leſſer moment, and not ſtriking at the very being of that Government, it ought to be born by publick pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, rather than to endanger the being of the State.</hi> The like words he uſes in another place,<note rend="inter">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 49.</note> ſaying, <hi>If the will of the Monarch exceed the limits of the Law, it ought to be ſubmitted to, ſo it be not contrary to God's Law, nor bring with it ſuch an evil to our ſelves, or the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:93433:154"/>
publick, that we cannot be acceſſory to it by obeying.</hi> Theſe are but fig-leaves to cover the nakedneſs of our Authors limited Monarch, formed upon weak ſuppoſals in caſes of leſſer moment. For if the Monarch be to govern only according to Law, no tranſgreſſion of his can be of ſo ſmall moment, if he break the bounds of Law, but it is a ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Government it ſelf, and may be made a leading caſe, and ſo bring on a preſcription againſt publick liberty; it ſtrikes at the very being of the Government, and brings with it ſuch an evil, as the party that ſuffers, or the publick can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be acceſſory to: let the caſe be never ſo ſmall, yet if there be illegality in the act, it ſtrikes at the very being of <hi>limited Monarchy,</hi> which is to be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal: unleſs our Author will ſay, as in effect he doth, That his limited Monarch muſt govern according to Law in great and publick matters only, and that in ſmaller matters which concern private men, or poor perſons, he may rule according to his own will.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, our Author tells us,<note rend="inter">P. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>If the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs act of exorbitancy or tranſgreſſion be mortal, and ſuch as ſuffered diſſolves the frame of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and publick liberty, then the illegality is to be ſet open, and redreſment ſought by petition; which if failing, prevention by reſiſtance ought to be: and if it be apparent, and appeal be made to the conſciences of mankind, then the fundamental Laws of that Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy muſt judge and pronounce the ſentence in every mans conſcience, and every man (ſo far as concerns him) muſt follow the evidence of Truth in his own ſoul to oppoſe or not to oppoſe, according as he can in conſcience acquit or condemn the act of the Governour or Monarch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="266" facs="tcp:93433:155"/>Whereas my Author requires, that <hi>the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive nature of illegal commands ſhall be ſet open:</hi> Surely his mind is, That each private man in his particular caſe ſhould make a publick remonſtrance to the World of the illegal act of the Monarch; and then if upon his Petition he cannot be relieved according to his deſire, he ought, or it is his duty to make reſiſtance. Here I would know, who can be the Judge whether the illegality be made apparent? It is a main point, ſince every man is prone to flatter himſelf in his own cauſe, and to think it good, and that the wrong or injuſtice he ſuffers is apparent, when other moderate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different men can diſcover no ſuch thing: and in this caſe the judgment of the common people cannot be gathered or known by any poſſible means; or if it could, it were like to be various and erroneous.</p>
                  <p>Yet our Author will have <hi>an Appeal made to the Conſcience of all Mankind,</hi> and that being made, he concludes, <hi>The Fundamental Laws must judge, and pronounce Sentence in every mans Conſcience.</hi> Whereas he ſaith,<note rend="inter">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 18.</note> 
                     <hi>The Fundamental Laws must judge</hi>; I would very gladly learn of him, or of any other for him, what a Fundamental Law is, or elſe have but any one Law named me that any man can ſay is a Fundamental Law of the Monarchy. I confeſs he tells us, That <hi>the Common Laws are the foundation,</hi>
                     <note rend="inter">P. 38.</note> 
                     <hi>and the Statute Laws are ſuperſtructive</hi>; yet I think he dares not ſay that there is any one branch or part of the Common Law, but that it may be taken away by an Act of Parliament: for many points of the Common Law <hi>(de facto)</hi> have, and <hi>(de jure)</hi>
                     <pb n="267" facs="tcp:93433:155"/>
any point may be taken away. How can that be called Fundamental, which hath and may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and yet the Statute-Laws ſtand firm and ſtable? It is contrary to the nature of Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, for the building to ſtand when the foundation is taken away.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the Common Law is generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be nothing elſe but common uſage or cuſtom, which by length of time only obtains authority: So that it follows in time after Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but cannot go before it, and be the rule to Government, by any original or radical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
                  <p>Alſo the Common Law being unwritten, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and difficult, cannot but be an uncertain rule to govern by; which is againſt the nature of a Rule, which is and ought to be certain.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, by making the Common Law only to be the foundation, <hi>Magna Charta</hi> is excluded from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Fundamental Law, and alſo all other Statutes from being limitations to Monarchy, ſince the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Laws only are to be Judge.</p>
                  <p>Truly the Conſcience of all mankind is a pretty large Tribunal for the Fundamental Laws to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Sentence in. It is very much that Laws which in their own nature are dumb, and always need a Judge to pronounce Sentence, ſhould now be able to ſpeak, and pronounce Sentence them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Such a Sentence ſurely muſt be upon the hearing of one party only; for it is impoſſible for a Monarch to make his defence and anſwer, and produce his Witneſſes, in every mans conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in each mans Cauſe, who will but queſtion the legality of the Monarchs Government. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:93433:156"/>
the ſentence cannot but be unjuſt, where but one mans tale is heard. For all this, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is, <hi>Every man must oppoſe or not oppoſe the Monarch according to his own conſcience.</hi> Thus at the laſt, every man is brought, by this Doctrine of our Authors, to be his own Judge. And I alſo appeal to the conſciences of all mankind, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the end of this be not utter confuſion, and Anarchy.</p>
                  <p>Yet after all this, the Author ſaith, <hi>This power of every mans judging the illegal acts of the Monarch,</hi>
                     <note rend="inter">P. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>argues not a Superiority of thoſe who judge over him who is judged</hi>; and he gives a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found reaſon for it: his words are, <hi>It is not autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative and civil, but moral, reſiding in reaſonable creatures, and lawful for them to execute.</hi> What our Author means by theſe words, (<hi>not authoritative and civil, but moral</hi>) perhaps I underſtand not, though I think I do; yet it ſerves my turn that he ſaith, That <hi>reſiſtance ought to be made, and every man must oppoſe or not oppoſe, according as in conſcience he can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit or condemn the acts of his Governour</hi>; for if it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a man to reſiſt and oppoſe his Governour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion, 'tis authoritative and civil. Whereas he adds, That <hi>moral judgment is reſiding in reaſonable creatures, and lawful for them to execute</hi>; he ſeems to imply, that authoritative and civil Judgment doth not reſide in reaſonable creatures, nor can be lawfully executed. Such a Concluſion fits well with Anarchy; for he that takes away all Government, and leaves every man to his own conſcience, and ſo makes him an independent in State, may well teach that authority reſides not in reaſonable creatures, nor can be lawfully executed.</p>

                  <p>
                     <note rend="inter">P. 26.</note>Firſt, <hi>A Monarch in a mixed Monarchy may be ſaid to be a Monarch</hi> (as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives) <hi>if he be the head and fountain of the power which governs and executes the eſtabliſhed Laws</hi>; that is, a man may be a Monarch, though he do but give power to others to govern and execute the eſtabliſhed Laws: thus he brings his Monarch one ſtep or peg lower ſtill than he was before: at firſt he made us believe his Monarch ſhould have the ſupreme Power, which is the legiſlative; then he falls from that, and tells us, A limited Monarch muſt govern according to Law only; thus he is brought from the legiſlative to the gubernative or executive Power only; nor doth he ſtay here, but is taken a hole lower, for now he muſt not govern, but <hi>he must constitute Officers to govern by Laws</hi>; if chuſing Officers to govern be governing, then our Author will allow his Monarch to be a Governour, not elſe: and therefore he that divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Supreme power</hi> into <hi>Legiſlative</hi> and <hi>Gubernative,</hi> doth now divide it into <hi>Legiſlative,</hi> and <hi>power of conſtituting Officers</hi> for governing by Laws; and <hi>this,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>is left to the Monarch.</hi> Indeed you have left him a fair portion of Power; but are we ſure he may enjoy this? It ſeems our Author is not confident in this neither, and ſome others do deny it him: our Author ſpeaking of the Government of this Kingdom,<note rend="inter">P. 38.</note> ſaith, <hi>The choice of the Officers is intruſted to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Monarch for ought I know:</hi> he is not reſolute in the point; but for ought he knows, and for ought I know, his Monarch is
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:93433:157"/>
but titular, an empty Title, certain of no Power at all.</p>
                  <p>The power of chuſing Officers only, is the baſeſt of all powers. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (as I remember) ſaith, <hi>The common people are fit for nothing but to chuſe Officers, and to take Accompts:</hi> and indeed, in all <hi>popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments</hi> the multitude perform this work: and this work in a King puts him below all his Subjects, and makes him the only Subject in a Kingdom, or the only man that cannot Govern: there is not the pooreſt man of the multitude but is capable of ſome Office or other, and by that means may ſome time or other perhaps govern according to the Laws; only the King can be no Officer, but to chuſe Officers; his Subjects may all govern, but he may not.</p>
                  <p>Next, I cannot ſee how in true ſenſe our Author can ſay, <hi>his Monarch is the head and fountain of Power,</hi> ſince his Doctrine is, That <hi>in a limited Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, the publick Society by original Conſtitution con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer on one man power:</hi> is not then the publick So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety the head and fountain of Power, and not the King?</p>

He (without any complement) is their Subject; for they, as Officers, may govern and command ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law: but he may not, for he muſt judge by his Judges in Courts of Juſtice only: that is, he may not judge or govern at all.</p>

                  <p>Beſides, how can he ſhew that in his mixed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy the Monarchs power is the greateſt? The greateſt ſhare that our Author allows him in the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative power, is a Negative voice, and the like is allowed to the Nobility and Commons: And truly, a Negative voice is but a baſe term to expreſs a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative power; a Negative voice is but a privative power, or indeed, no power at all to do any thing, only a power to hinder an Act from being done.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore I conclude, not any of his four,<note rend="inter">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 26.</note> nor all of them put into one perſon, make the State Monarchical.</p>
                  <p>This mixed Monarchy, juſt like the limited, ends in confuſion and deſtruction of all Government: you ſhall hear the Authors confeſſion, <hi>That one inconvenience muſt neceſſarily be in all mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Governments,</hi>

                     <hi>which I ſhewed to be in limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Governments; there can be no conſtituted legal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative Judge of the Fundamental Controverſies ariſing between the three Eſtates: If ſuch do riſe, it is
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:93433:158"/>
the fatal diſeaſe of thoſe Governments, for which no ſalve can be applied. It is a caſe beyond the poſſible proviſion of ſuch a Government; of this queſtion there is no legal Judge. The accuſing ſide muſt make it evident to every mans Conſcience.— The Appeal muſt be to the Community, as if there were no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and as by evidence Conſciences are convinced, they are bound to give their aſſiſtance.</hi> The wit of man cannot ſay more for <hi>Anarchy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus have I picked out the flowers out of his Doctrine about limited Monarchy, and preſented them with ſome brief Annotations; it were a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious work to collect all the learned contradictions, and ambiguous expreſſions that occur in every page of his Platonick Monarchy; the Book hath ſo much of fancy, that it is a better piece of Poetry than Policy.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe many may think, that the main Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>limited</hi> and <hi>mixed</hi> Monarchy may in it ſelf be moſt authentical, and grounded upon ſtrong and evident reaſon, although our Author perhaps have failed in ſome of his expreſſions, and be liable to exceptions: Therefore I will be bold to inquire, whether <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> could find either reaſon or exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a <hi>limited</hi> or <hi>mixed</hi> Monarchy; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe I find our Author altogether inſiſts upon a rational way of juſtifying his opinion. No man I think will deny, but that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently curious in ſearching out the ſeveral forms of Commonwealths and Kingdoms; yet I do not find, that he ever ſo much as dreamed of either a <hi>limited</hi> or <hi>mixed</hi> Monarchy. Several other ſorts of Monarchies he reckons up: in the Third Book of his Politicks, he ſpends three whole Chapters
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:93433:159"/>
together, upon the ſeveral kinds of Monarchy.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in his fourteenth Chapter he mentions four kinds of Monarchy.</p>

                     <hi>The</hi> Barbarick <hi>King</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle) had a Power very near to Tyranny; yet they were lawful and Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, becauſe the</hi> Barbarians <hi>are of a more ſervile nature than the</hi> Grecians, <hi>and the</hi> Aſiaticks <hi>than the</hi> Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans; <hi>they do willingly, without repining, live under a Maſterly Government; yet their Government is ſtable and ſafe, becauſe they are Paternal and lawful King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and their Guards are Royal and not Tyrannical: for Kings are guarded by their own Subjects, and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants are guarded by Strangers.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> Aeſymnetical <hi>King</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle) in old time in</hi> Greece, <hi>was an Elective Tyrant, and differed only from the</hi> Barbarian <hi>Kings, in that he was Elective, and not Paternal: theſe ſorts of Kings, becauſe they were Tyrannical, were Maſterly; but becauſe they were over ſuch as voluntarily Elected them, they were Regal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Heroick were thoſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle) which flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the Heroical times, to whom the People did willingly obey; and they were Paternal and lawful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe Kings did deſerve well of the multitude, either
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:93433:159"/>
by teaching them Arts, or by Warring for them, or by gathering them together when they were diſperſed, or by dividing Lands amongſt them: theſe Kings had ſupreme Power in War, in Sacrifices, in Judicature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe four ſorts of Monarchy hath <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thus diſtinguiſhed, and after ſums them up together, and concludes his Chapter as if he had forgot himſelf, and reckons up a fifth kind of Monarchy; which is, ſaith he, <hi>When one alone hath Supreme power of all the rest: for as there is a domeſtical Kingdom of one Houſe, ſo the Kingdom of a City, or of one or many Nations, is a Family.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are all the ſorts of Monarchy that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath found out, and he hath ſtrained hard to make them ſo many: firſt, for his <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> King, himſelf confeſſeth that he was but a kind of Military Commander in War, and ſo in effect no more a King than all Generals of Armies: And yet this No-king of his was not limited by any Law, nor mixed with any Companions of his Government: when he was in the Wars out of the Confines of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemon,</hi> he was, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſtiles him, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, of full and abſolute Command, no Law, no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion to govern his Army but his own will.</p>
                  <p>Next, for <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s <hi>Aeſymnetical</hi> King, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, he was out of date in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s time; for he ſaith, he was <hi>amongſt the ancient Greeks <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. Ariſtotle</hi> might well have ſpared the naming him (if he had not wanted other ſorts) for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his own Nation: for he that but now told us the <hi>Barbarians</hi> were of a more ſervile nature than the <hi>Grecians,</hi> comes here, and tells us, That theſe old <hi>Greek</hi> Kings were Elective Tyrants. The <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> did but ſuffer Tyrants in ſhew, but the old
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:93433:160"/>
                     <hi>Grecians</hi> choſe Tyrants indeed; which then muſt we think were the greater ſlaves, the <hi>Greeks</hi> or the <hi>Barbarians?</hi> Now if theſe ſorts of Kings were Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, we cannot ſuppoſe they were limited either by Law, or joyned with Companions: Indeed <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> ſaith, ſome of theſe Tyrants were limited to certain times and actions, for they had not all their Power for term of life, nor could meddle but in certain buſineſſes; yet during the time they were Tyrants, and in the actions whereto they were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, they had abſolute Power to do what they liſt according to their own will, or elſe they could not have been ſaid to be Tyrants.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s <hi>Heroick</hi> King, he gives the like note upon him, that he did upon the <hi>Aeſymnet,</hi> that he was in old time <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick times. The thing that made theſe Heroical Kingdoms differ from other ſorts of Kingdoms, was only the means by which the firſt Kings obtained their Kingdoms, and not the manner of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for in that they were as abſolute as other Kings were, without either limitation by Law, or mixture of Companions.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, as for <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s <hi>Barbarick</hi> ſort of Kings, ſince he reckoned all the World <hi>Barbarians,</hi> except the <hi>Grecians,</hi> his <hi>Barbarick</hi> King muſt extend to all other ſorts of Kings in the World, beſides thoſe of <hi>Greece,</hi> and ſo may go under <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s fifth ſort of Kings, which in general comprehends all other ſorts, and is no ſpecial form of Monarchy.</p>
                  <p>Thus upon a true account it is evident, that the five ſeveral ſorts of Kings mentioned by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> are at the moſt but different and accidental means of the firſt obtaining or holding of Monarchies,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:93433:160"/>
and not real or eſſential differences of the manner of Government, which was always abſolute, without either limitation or mixture.</p>
                  <p>I may be thought perhaps to miſtake, or wrong <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in queſtioning his diverſities of Kings; but it ſeems <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf was partly of the ſame mind; for in the very next Chapter, when he had better conſidered of the point, he confeſſed, That <hi>to ſpeak the truth, there were almoſt but two ſorts of Monarchies worth the conſidering, that is, his firſt or</hi> Laconick <hi>ſort, and his fifth or laſt ſort, where one alone hath ſupreme Power over all the reſt:</hi> thus he hath brought his five ſorts to two. Now for the firſt of theſe two, his <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> King, he hath confeſſed before, that <hi>he was no more than a Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſimo</hi> of an Army, and ſo upon the matter no King at all: and then there remains only his laſt ſort of Kings, <hi>where one alone hath the ſupreme Power.</hi> And this in ſubſtance is the final reſolution of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf: for in his ſixteenth Chapter, where he delivers his laſt thoughts touching the kinds of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, he firſt diſchargeth his <hi>Laconick</hi> King from being any ſort of Monarchy, and then gives us two exact rules about Monarchy; and both theſe are point blank againſt limited and mixed Monarchy; therefore I ſhall propoſe them to be conſidered of, as concluding all Monarchy to be abſolute and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The one Rule is,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Arist. Pol.</hi> l. 3. c. 16.</note> That <hi>he that is ſaid to be a King according to Law, is no ſort of Government or Kingdom at all:</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond Rule is, That <hi>a true King is he that ruled all according to his own will,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="278" facs="tcp:93433:161"/>This latter frees a Monarch from the mixture of partners or ſharers in Government, as the former rule doth from limitation by Laws.</p>
                  <p>Thus in brief I have traced <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and broken paſſages, touching diverſities of Kings; where he firſt finds but four ſorts, and then he ſtumbles upon a fifth; and in the next Chapter contents himſelf only with two ſorts of Kings, but in the Chapter following concludes with one, which is the true perfect Monarch, who rules all by his own will: in all this we find nothing for a regulated or mixed Monarchy, but againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, whereas the Author of the Treatiſe of Monarchy affirms it as a prime Principle, <hi>That all Monarchies</hi> (except that of the <hi>Jews) depend upon humane deſignment, when the conſent of a Society of men, and a fundamental Contract of a Nation, by original or radical Conſtitution confers Power:</hi> he muſt know, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſearching into the Original of Government, ſhews himſelf in this point a better Divine than our Author; and as if he had ſtudied the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> teacheth, That Monarchies fetch their Pedigree from the Right of Fathers, and not from the Gift or Contract of People; his words may thus be Engliſhed. <hi>At the first, Cities were governed by Kings, and ſo even to this day are Nations alſo: for ſuch as were under Kingly Government did come together; for every Houſe is governed by a King, who is the eldeſt; and ſo alſo Colonies are governed for kindred ſake.</hi> And immediately before, he tells us, <hi>That the firſt Society made of many Houſes is a Village, which naturally ſeems to be a Colony of a Houſe, which ſome call Foſter-brethren, or Children, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="279" facs="tcp:93433:161"/>So in concluſion we have gained <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in three main and eſſential points.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>A King according to Law makes no kind of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>A King muſt rule according to his own will.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. <hi>The Original of Kings, is from the right of Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</hi>

                  </list>
                  <p>What <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s judgment was two thouſand years ſince, is agreeable to the Doctrine of the great modern Politician <hi>Bodin:</hi> Hear him touching limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Monarchy: <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto Majeſty or Soveraignty</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>belongeth an abſolute power, not ſubject to any Law—Chief power given unto a Prince with condition, is not properly Soveraignty, or power abſolute, except ſuch conditions annexed to the Soveraignty, be directly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended within the Laws of God and Nature.— Albeit by the ſufferance of the King of</hi> England, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies between the King and his People are ſometimes determined by the high Court of Parliament, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the Lord Chief Juſtice of</hi> England; <hi>yet all the Eſtates remain in full ſubjection to the King, who is no ways bound to follow their advice, neither to conſent to their requeſts.—It is certain, that the Laws, Priviledges, and Grants of Princes, have no force but during their life, if they be not ratified by the expreſs conſent, or by ſufferance of the Prince following, especially Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.— Much leſs ſhould a Prince be bound unto the Laws he maketh himſelf; for a man may well receive a Law from another man, but impoſſible it is in nature for to give a Law unto himſelf, no more than it is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a mans ſelf in a matter depending of his own will.</hi> The Law ſaith, <hi>Nulla obligatio conſiſtere poteſt, quae à voluntate promittentis statum capit. The Soveraign Prince may derogate unto the Laws that he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:93433:162"/>
and ſworn to keep, if the equity thereof be ceaſed; and that of himſelf, without the conſent of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.—The Majeſty of a true Soveraign Prince is to be known, when the Eſtates of all the People aſſembled, in all humility preſent their requeſts and ſupplications to their Prince, without having power in any thing, to command, determine, or give voice, but that that which it pleaſeth the King to like or diſlike, to command or bid, is holden for Law: wherein they which have written of the duty of Magiſtrates have deceived themſelves, in maintaining that the power of the People is greater than the Prince; a thing which cauſeth oft true Subjects to revolt from their obedience to their Prince, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth matter of great troubles in Commonwealths; of which their opinion there is neither reaſon nor ground: for if the King be ſubject unto the aſſemblies and Decrees of the people, he ſhould neither be King nor Soveraign, and the Commonwealth neither Realm nor Monarchy, but a meer Ariſtocracy.—So we ſee the principal point of Soveraign Majeſty, and abſolute power, to conſiſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in giving Laws unto the Subjects in general without their conſent.</hi> Bodin de Rep. l. 1. c. 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To confound the state of Monarchy with the Popular or Ariſtocratical eſtate, is a thing impoſſible, and in effect incompatible, and ſuch as cannot be imagined: for Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty being of it ſelf indiviſible, how can it at one and the ſame time be divided betwixt one Prince, the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and the people in common? The firſt mark of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Majeſty, is to be of power to give Laws, and to command over them unto the Subjects; and who ſhould thoſe Subjects be that ſhould yield their obedience to the Law, if they ſhould have alſo power to make the Laws? who ſhould he be that could give the Law? being himſelf conſtrained to receive it of them, unto whom himſelf gave
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:93433:162"/>
it? ſo that of neceſſity we muſt conclude, That as no one in particular hath the power to make the Law in ſuch a State, that then the State muſt needs be a State popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.—Never any Commonwealth hath been made of an Ariſtocracy and popular Eſtate, much leſs of the three Eſtates of a Commonweal.—Such ſtates wherein the rights of Soveraignty are divided, are not rightly to be called Commonweals, but rather the corruption of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweals, as</hi> Herodotus <hi>has moſt briefly but truly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.—Commonweals which change their ſtate, the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign right &amp; power of them being divided, find no reſt from Civil wars and broils, till they again recover ſome one of the three Forms, and the Soveraignty be wholly in one of the ſtates or other. Where the rights of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty are divided betwixt the Prince &amp; his Subjects, in that confuſion of ſtate there is ſtill endleſs ſtirs and quarrels for the ſuperiority, until that ſome one, ſome few, or all together, have got the Soveraignty.</hi> Id. lib. 2. c. 1.</p>
                  <p>This Judgment of <hi>Bodin</hi>'s touching Limited and Mixed Monarchy, is not according to the mind of our Author, nor yet of the Obſervator, who uſeth the ſtrength of his Wit to overthrow Abſolute and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Government in this Kingdom; and yet in the main body of his diſcourſe, lets fall ſuch Truths from his Pen, as give a deadly wound to the Cauſe he pleads for, if they be indifferently weighed and conſidered. I will not pick a line or two here and there to wreſt againſt him, but will preſent a whole Page of his Book, or more together, that ſo we may have an entire proſpect upon the Obſervators mind: <hi>Without Society</hi> (ſaith the Obſervator) <hi>men could not live; without Laws men could not be ſociable; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Authority ſomewhere to judge according to Law, Law
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:93433:163"/>
were vain: It was ſoon therefore provided, that Laws according to the dictate of Reaſon, ſhould be ratified by common conſent; when it afterward appeared, that man was yet ſubject to unnatural deſtruction, by the Tyranny of entruſted Magiſtrates, a miſchief almoſt as fatal as to be without all Magiſtracy. How to provide a wholeſome remedy therefore, was not ſo eaſie to be invented: it was not difficult to invent Laws for the limiting of Supream Governours; but to invent how thoſe Laws ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, or by whom interpreted, was almoſt impoſſible,</hi> Nam quis cuſtodiet ipſos Cuſtodes? <hi>to place a Superiour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a Supream, was held unnatural; yet what a lifeleſs thing would Law be without any Judge to determine and force it? If it be agreed upon, that limits ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to Princes and Judges to decree according to thoſe limits, yet another inconvenience will preſently affront us: for we cannot reſtrain Princes too far, but we ſhall diſable them from ſome good: long it was ere the world could extricate it ſelf out of all theſe extremities, or find out an orderly means whereby to avoid the danger of unbounded Prerogative on this hand, and of exceſſive li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty on the other; and ſcarce has long experience yet fully ſatisfied the minds of all men in it. In the Infancy of the world, when man was not ſo artificial and obdurate in cruelty and oppreſſion as now, and Policy most rude, moſt Nations did chooſe rather to ſubject themſelves to the meer diſcretion of their Lords, than rely upon any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits; and ſo be ruled by Arbitrary Edicts, than written Statutes. But ſince Tyranny being more exquiſite, and Policy more perfect, eſpecially where learning and Religion flouriſh, few Nations will endure the thraldome which uſually accompanies unbounded and unconditionate Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty; Yet</hi> long it was <hi>ere the bounds and conditions of Supream Lords was ſo wiſely determined, or quietly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:93433:163"/>
as now they are: for at firſt, when as</hi> Ephori, Tribuni, Curatores, &amp;c. <hi>were erected to poiſe againſt the ſcale of Soveraignty, much blood was ſhed about them, and States were put into new broils by them, and in ſome places the remedy proved worſe than the diſeaſe. In all great diſtreſſes, the body of the people were ever conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to riſe, and by force of the major party to put an end to all inteſtine ſtrifes, and make a redreſs of all publick grievances: But many times calamities grew to a ſtrange height, before ſo cumberſome a body could be raiſed; and when it was raiſed, the motions of it were ſo distracted and irregular, that after much ſpoil and effuſion of blood, ſometimes only one Tyranny was exchanged for another, till ſome was invented to regulate the motions of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples moliminous body. I think Arbitrary rule was moſt ſafe for the World: but</hi> Now, <hi>ſince moſt Countries have found an art and peaceable order for publick Aſſemblies, whereby the people may aſſume its own power to do it ſelf right, without diſturbance to it ſelf or injury to Princes; he is very unjuſt that will oppoſe this art or order. That Princes may not be</hi> Now <hi>beyond all limits and Laws, nor yet be tyed upon thoſe limits by any private parties; the whole Community, in its underived Majeſty, ſhall convene to do juſtice; and that the Convention may not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intelligence, certain times, and places, and forms, ſhall be appointed for its reglement; and that the vaſtneſs of its own bulk may not breed confuſion, by vertue of election and repreſentation, a few ſhall act for many, the wiſe, ſhall conſent for the ſimple, the vertue of all ſhall redound to ſome, and the prudence of ſome ſhall redound to all; and ſurely as this admirably-compoſed Court, which is now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Parliament, is more regularly and orderly formed, than when it was called mickle Synod of</hi> Wittena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemot, <hi>or when this real body of the People did throng
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:93433:164"/>
together at it: ſo it is</hi> not yet <hi>perhaps without ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, which by art &amp; policy might receive farther amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ſome diviſions have ſprung up of late between both Houſes, and ſome between the King and both Houſes, by reaſon of incertainty of Juriſdiction; and ſome Lawyers doubt how far the Parliament is able to create new forms and preſidents, and has a Juriſdiction over it ſelf; all theſe doubts would be ſolemnly ſolved: but in the firſt place, the true priviledges of Parliament belonging not only to the being and efficacy of it, but to the honour and complement of it, would be clearly declared: for the very naming of priviledges of Parliament, as if they were chimera's to the ignorant ſort, and utterly unknown unto the Learned, hath been entertained with ſcorn ſince the beginning of this Parliament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this large paſſage taken out of the Obſervator which concerns the original of all Government, two notable Propoſitions may be principally obſerved.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, our Obſervator confeſſeth <hi>arbitrary or abſolute government to be the firſt, and the ſafeſt government for the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, he acknowledgeth that <hi>the Juriſdiction is uncertain, and the priviledges not clearly declared of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Monarchy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe two evident truths delivered by him, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours mainly to diſguiſe. He ſeems to inſinuate that <hi>Arbitrary Government was but in the infancy of the World,</hi> for ſo he terms it; but if we enquire of him, how long he will have this infancy of the World to laſt, he grants it continued above three thouſand years, which is an unreaſonable time for the World to continue under-age: for the firſt oppoſers he doth find of Arbitrary power, were the <hi>Ephori, Tribuni, Curatores, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Ephori</hi> were above three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:93433:164"/>
years after the Creation, and the <hi>Tribuni</hi> were later; as for his <hi>Curatores,</hi> I know not whom he means, except the <hi>Maſter of the Court of Wards,</hi> I cannot Engliſh the word <hi>Curator</hi> better. I do not believe that he can ſhew that any <hi>Curatores</hi> or <hi>&amp; cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tera</hi>'s which he mentions were ſo ancient as the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phori.</hi> As for the <hi>Tribuni,</hi> he miſtakes much if he thinks they were erected to limit and bound Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; for the State of <hi>Rome</hi> was at the leaſt <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical</hi> (as they call it) <hi>if not popular,</hi> when <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the People were firſt hatched. And for the <hi>Ephori,</hi> their power did not limit or regulate Monarchy, but quite take it away; for a <hi>Lacedemonian King in the judgment of</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>was no King indeed, but in name only, as Generaliſſimo of an Army</hi>; and the beſt Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians reckon the <hi>Spartan</hi> Commonwealth to have been <hi>Ariſtocratical,</hi> and not <hi>Monarchical</hi>; and if a limited Monarchy cannot be found in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> I doubt our <hi>Obſervator</hi> will hardly find it any where elſe in the whole World; and in ſubſtance he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth as much, when he ſaith, Now <hi>moſt Countries have found out an art and peaceable order for publick aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies</hi>; as if it were a thing but new done, and not before; for ſo the word <hi>Now</hi> doth import.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Obſervator</hi> in confeſſing <hi>the Juriſdiction to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, and the priviledges undetermined of that Court that ſhould bound and limit Monarchy,</hi> doth in effect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge there is no ſuch Court at all: for every Court conſiſts of <hi>Juriſdictions</hi> &amp; <hi>Priviledges</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is theſe two that create a Court, and are the eſſentials of it: <hi>If the admirably compoſed Court of Parliament have ſome defects which may receive amendment,</hi> as he ſaith, <hi>and if thoſe defects be ſuch as cauſe diviſions both between the Houſes, and between the King and both Houſes, and theſe
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:93433:165"/>
diviſions be about</hi> ſo main a matter as <hi>Juriſdictions and Priviledges, and power to create new Priviledges,</hi> all which are the Fundamentals of every Court, (for until they be agreed upon, the act of every Court may not only be uncertain, but invalid, and cauſe of tumults and ſedition:) And <hi>if all theſe doubts and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions have need to be ſolemnly ſolved,</hi> as our <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> confeſſeth: Then he hath no reaſon at all to ſay, that <hi>Now the conditions of Supream Lords are wiſely determined and quietly conſerved,</hi> or that Now <hi>most Countries have found out an art, and peaceable order for publick affairs, whereby the People may reſume its own power to do it ſelf right without injury unto Princes:</hi> for how can the <hi>underived Majeſty of the people by aſſuming its own power,</hi> tell how to do <hi>her ſelf right,</hi> or how <hi>to avoid doing injury to the Prince, if her Juriſdiction be uncertain, and Priviledges undetermined?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He tells us Now <hi>most Countries have found an art, and peaceable order for publick Aſſemblies: and to the intent that Princes may not be</hi> Now <hi>beyond all limits and Laws, the whole community in its underived Majeſty ſhall convene to do Juſtice.</hi> But he doth not name ſo much as one Country or Kingdom that hath found out this art, where the whole Community in its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derived Majeſty did ever convene to do Juſtice. I challenge him, or any other for him, to name but one Kingdom that hath either <hi>Now</hi> or heretofore found out this art or peaceable order. We do hear a great rumor in this age, of moderated and limited Kings; <hi>Poland, Sweden,</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> are talked of for ſuch; and in theſe Kingdoms, or no where, is ſuch a moderated Government, as our <hi>Obſervator</hi> means, to be found. A little enquiry would be made into the manner of the Government of theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms:
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:93433:165"/>
for theſe Northern People, as <hi>Bodin</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, <hi>breath after liberty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt for <hi>Poland, Boterus</hi> ſaith, that <hi>the Government of it is elective altogether, and repreſenteth rather an Ariſtocracie than a Kingdom: the Nobility, who have great Authority in the Diets, chuſing the King, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting his Authority, making his Soveraignty but a ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh Royalty: theſe diminutions of Regality began first by default of King</hi> Lewis, <hi>and</hi> Jagello, <hi>who to gain the ſucceſſion in the Kingdom contrary to the Laws, one for his Daughter, and the other for his Son, departed with many of his Royalties and Prerogatives, to buy the voices of the Nobility.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> Author of the Book called <hi>the Eſtates of the World,</hi> doth inform us that the <hi>Princes Authority was more free, not being ſubject to any Laws, and having abſolute power, not only of their eſtates, but alſo of Life and Death. Since Chriſtian Religion was received, it began to be moderated, firſt by holy admonitions of the Biſhops and Clergy, and then by ſervices of the Nobility in War: Religious Princes gave many Honours, and many liberties to the Clergy and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and quit much of their Rights, the which their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors have continued. The ſuperiour dignity is reduced to two degrees, that is, the</hi> Palatinate <hi>and the</hi> Chaſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leine, <hi>for that Kings in former times did by little and little call theſe men to publick conſultations, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that they had Abſolute power to do all things of themſelves, to command, diſpoſe, recompence, and puniſh, of their own motions: ſince they have ordained that theſe Dignities ſhould make the body of a Senate, the King doth not challenge much right and power over his Nobility, nor over their estates, neither hath he any over the Clergy. And though the Kings Authority depends on the Nobility for his election, yet in many things it is Abſolute after he
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:93433:166"/>
is choſen: He appoints the Diets at what time and place he pleaſeth; he chooſeth Lay-Councellers, and nominates the Biſhops, and whom he will have to be his Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil: He is abſolute diſpoſer of the Revenues of the Crown: He is abſolute eſtabliſher of the Decrees of the Diets: It is in his power to advance and reward whom he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. He is Lord immediate of his Subjects, but not of his Nobility: He is Soveraign Judge of his Nobility in criminal cauſes. The power of the Nobility daily increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, for that in reſpect of the Kings election, they neither have Law, rule, nor form to do it, neither by writing nor tradition. As the King governs his Subjects which are immediately his, with abſolute Authority; ſo the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility diſpoſe immediately of their vaſſals, over whom every one hath more than a Regal power, ſo as they intreat them like ſlaves. There be certain men in</hi> Poland <hi>who are called</hi> EARTHLY MESSENGERS <hi>or</hi> Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio's, <hi>they are as it were Agents of Juriſdictions or Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Nobility: theſe have a certain Authority, and, as</hi> Boterus <hi>ſaith, in the time of their Diets theſe men aſſemble in a place near to the Senate-Houſe, where they chuſe two Marſhals, by whom (but with a Tribune-like authority) they ſignifie unto the Council what their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts are. Not long ſince, their Authority and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion grew ſo mightily, that they now carry themſelves as Heads and Governours, rather than officers and miniſters of the publick decrees of the State: One of the Council refuſed his Senators place, to become one of theſe Officers. Every Palatine, the King requiring it, calls together all the Nobility of his Palatinate; where having propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto them the matters whereon they are to treat, and their will being known, they chuſe four or ſix out of the company of the</hi> EARTHLY MESSENGERS; theſe Deputies meet and make one body, which they call the order of Knights.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="289" facs="tcp:93433:166"/>This being of late years the manner and order of the government of <hi>Poland,</hi> it is not poſſible for the <hi>Obſervator</hi> to find among them that the <hi>whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity in its underived Majeſty doth ever convene to do Juſtice:</hi> nor any election or repreſentation of the Community, or that the People aſſume its own power to do it ſelf right. The EARTHLY MESSENGERS, though they may be thought to repreſent the Commons, and of late take much upon them, yet they are elected and choſen by the Nobility, as their agents and officers. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity are either vaſſals to the King, or to the Nobility, and enjoy as little freedom or liberty as any Nation. But it may be ſaid perhaps, that though the Community do not limit the King, yet the Nobility do, and ſo he is a limited Monarch. The Anſwer is, that in truth, though the Nobility at the chuſing of their King do limit his power, and do give him an Oath; yet afterwards they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a deſire to pleaſe him, and to ſecond his will; and this they are forced to do, to avoid diſcord: for by reaſon of their great power, they are ſubject to great diſſentions, not only among themſelves, but between them and the order of Knights, which are the <hi>Earthly Meſſengers:</hi> yea, the Provinces are at diſcord one with another: and as for Religion, the diverſity of Sects in <hi>Poland</hi> breed perpetual jars and hatred among the People, there being as many Sects as in <hi>Amſterdam</hi> it ſelf, or any popular government can deſire. The danger of ſedition is the cauſe, that though the Crown depends on the election of the Nobility; yet they have never rejected the Kings ſucceſſour, or transferred the Realm to any other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, but once, when depoſing <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> for his
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:93433:167"/>
idleneſs (whom yet afterward they reſtored) they elected <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> But if the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity do agree to hold their King to his conditions, which is, not to conclude any thing but by the advice of his Council of Nobles, nor to chooſe any Wife without their leaves, then it muſt be ſaid to be a Commonweal, not a Royalty; and the King but only the mouth of the Kingdom, or as Queen <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina</hi> complained, that <hi>Her Husband was but the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a Soveraign.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next, if it be conſidered how the Nobility of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> came to this great power; it was not by any <hi>original contract,</hi> or <hi>popular convention:</hi> for it is ſaid <hi>they have neither Law, Rule, nor Form written or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written, for the election of their King,</hi> they may thank the Biſhops and Clergy: for by their holy admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and advice, good and Religious Princes, to ſhew their piety, were firſt brought to <hi>give much of their Rights and Priviledges to their Subjects, devout Kings were meerly cheated of ſome of their Royalties.</hi> What power ſoever general Aſſemblies of the Eſtates claim or exerciſe over and above the bare naked act of Counſelling, they were firſt beholding to the Popiſh Clergy for it: it is they firſt brought Parliaments into requeſt and power: I cannot find in any Kingdom, but only where Popery hath been, that Parliaments have been of reputation: and in the greateſt times of Superſtition they are firſt mentioned.</p>
                  <p>As for the Kingdom of <hi>Denmark,</hi> I read that the Senators, who are all choſen out of the Nobility, and ſeldom exceed the number of 28, with the chief of the Realm, do chuſe their King. They have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in a manner ſet the Kings eldeſt Son upon the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:93433:167"/>
Royal Throne. The Nobility of <hi>Denmark</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Coronation of <hi>Frederick</hi> 1559, till he ſware not to put any Noble-man to death until he were judged of the Senate; and that all Noble-men ſhould have power of Life and Death over their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects without appeal; and the King to give no Office without conſent of the Council. There is a Chancellour of the Realm, before whom they do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal from all the Provinces and Iſlands, and from him to the King himſelf. I hear of nothing in this Kingdom that tends to Popularity; no Aſſembly of the Commons, no elections, or repreſentation of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sweden</hi> is governed by a King <hi>heretofore elective,</hi> but now made hereditary in <hi>Guſtavus</hi> time: it is divided into Provinces: an appeal lieth from the Vicount of every territory to a Soveraign Judge called a <hi>Lamen</hi>; from the <hi>Lamens,</hi> to the Kings Council; and from this Council, to the King himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Now let the <hi>Obſervator</hi> bethink himſelf, whether all, or any of theſe three Countries have found out any art at all whereby the <hi>People or community may aſſume its own Power:</hi> if neither of theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms have, moſt Countries have not, nay none have. The People or Community in theſe three Realms are as abſolute Vaſſals as any in the World; the regulating power, if any be, is in the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: Nor is it ſuch in the Nobility as it makes ſhew for. The Election of Kings is rather a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, than any real power: for they dare hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chuſe any but the Heir, or one of the blood Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al: if they ſhould chuſe one among the Nobility, it would prove very factious; if a ſtranger, odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, neither ſafe. For the Government, though
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:93433:168"/>
the Kings be ſworn to raign according to the Laws, and are not to do any thing without the conſent of their Council in publick affairs: yet in regard they have power both to advance and reward whom they pleaſe, the Nobility and Senators do comply with their Kings. And <hi>Boterus</hi> concludes of the Kings of <hi>Poland,</hi> who ſeem to be moſt moderated, that <hi>ſuch as is their valour, dexterity, and wiſdom, ſuch is their Power, Authority, and Government.</hi> Alſo <hi>Bodin</hi> ſaith, that <hi>theſe three Kingdoms are States changeable and uncertain, as the Nobility is ſtronger than the Prince, or the Prince than the Nobility</hi>; and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ſo far from liberty, that he ſaith, <hi>Divers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Lords exact not only Cuſtoms, but Tributes alſo; which are confirmed and grow ſtronger, both by long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of time, and uſe of Judgments.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="294" facs="tcp:93433:170"/>The Laws, Ordinances, Letters-Patents, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and Grants of Princes, have no force but du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Life; if they be not ratified by the expreſs Conſent, or at leaſt by Sufferance of the Prince fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, who had knowledge thereof.</p>
                  <p>If the Soveraign Prince be exempted from the Laws of his Predeceſſors, much leſs ſhall he be bound unto the Laws he maketh Himſelf; for a man may well receive a Law from Another man, but impoſſible it is in Nature for to give a Law unto Himſelf, no more than it is to Command a man's ſelf in a matter depending of his Own Will: <hi>There can be no Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which taketh State from the meer Will of him that promiſeth the ſame</hi>; which is a neceſſary Reaſon to prove evidently, that a King cannot bind his Own Hands, albeit that he would: We ſee alſo in the end of all Laws theſe words, <hi>Becauſe it hath ſo Pleaſed us</hi>; to give us to underſtand, that the Laws of a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Prince, although they be grounded upon Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet depend upon nothing but his meer and frank good Will. But as for the Laws of God, all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and People are unto them ſubject; neither is it in their power to impugne them, if they will not be guilty of High Treaſon againſt God; under the greatneſs of whom, all <hi>Monarchs</hi> of the world ought to bow their Heads, in all fear and reverence.</p>
                  <p>A Queſtion may be, <hi>Whether a Prince be ſubject to the Laws of his Countrey that he hath ſworn to keep, or not?</hi> If a Soveraign Prince promiſe by Oath to his Subjects to keep the Laws, he is bound to keep them; not for that a Prince is bound to keep his Laws by himſelf or by his Predeceſſors, but by the juſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions and Promiſes which he hath made himſelf;
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:93433:170"/>
be it by Oath, or without any Oath at all, as ſhould a private man be: and for the ſame cauſes that a Private man may be relieved from his unjuſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Promiſe, as for that it was ſo grievous, or for that he was by deceit or fraud Circumvented, or induced thereunto by Errour, or Force, or juſt Fear, or by ſome great Hurt; even for the ſame cauſes the Prince may be reſtored in that which tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the diminiſhing of his Majeſty: And ſo our <hi>Maxime</hi> reſteth, <hi>That the Prince is not ſubject to His Laws, nor to the Laws of his Predeceſſors, but well to his Own juſt and reaſonable Conventions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Soveraign Prince may derogate from the Laws that he hath promiſed and ſworn to keep, if the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof ceaſe, and that of himſelf, without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of his Subjects; which his Subjects cannot do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Themſelves, if they be not by the Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>
                  <p>The Foreign Princes well-adviſed, will never take Oath to keep the Laws of their Predeceſſors; for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they are not Sovereigns.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding all Oaths, the Prince may Dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the Laws, or Fruſtrate or Diſannul the ſame, the Reaſon and Equity of them ceaſing.</p>
                  <p>There is not any Bond for the Soveraign Prince to keep the Laws, more than ſo far as Right and Juſtice requireth.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it to be found, that the Antient Kings of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> took any Oaths, no not they which were Anointed by <hi>Samuel, Elias,</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p>As for General and Particular, which concern the Right of men in Private, they have not uſed to be otherwiſe Changed, but after General Aſſemblies of

the Three Eſtates in <hi>France</hi>; not for that it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the Kings to reſt on their Advice, or that he may not do the Contrary to that they demand, if na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reaſon and Juſtice do ſo require. And in that the Greatneſs and Majeſty of a true Soveraign Prince is to be known, when the Eſtates of all the People aſſembled together in all Humility preſent their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts and Supplications to their Prince, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any Power in any thing to Command, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, or to give Voice; but that that which it pleaſeth the King to Like or Diſlike, to Command or Forbid, is holden for Law. Wherein they which have written of the Duty of Magiſtrates, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived themſelves, in maintaining that the Power of the People is greater than the Prince; a thing which oft-times cauſeth the true Subjects to revolt from the Obedience which they owe unto their Soveraign Prince, and miniſtreth matter of great Troubles in Commonwealths; of which their Opinion, there is neither reaſon nor ground.</p>
                  <p>If the King ſhould be Subject unto the Aſſemblies and Decrees of the People, he ſhould neither be King nor Soveraign, and the Commonwealth neither Realm nor Monarchy; but a meer <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> of many Lords in Power equal, where the Greater part commandeth the leſs; and whereon the Laws are not to be publiſhed in the Name of him that Ruleth, but in the Name and Authority of the Eſtates; as in an <hi>Ariſtocratical</hi> Seignory, where he that is Chief hath no Power, but oweth Obeiſance to the Seignory; unto whom yet they every one of them feign them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to owe their Faith and Obedience: which are all things ſo abſurd, as hard it is to ſee which is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt from Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="297" facs="tcp:93433:171"/>When <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth, the <hi>French</hi> King, then but Fourteen years old, held a Parliament at <hi>Tours,</hi> although the Power of the Parliament was never Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nor After ſo great, as in thoſe Times; yet <hi>Relli</hi> then the Speaker for the People, turning himſelf to the King, thus beginneth: <hi>Moſt High, moſt Mighty, and moſt Chriſtian King, our Natural and Onely Lord; we poor, humble, and obedient Subjects,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which are come hither by your Command, in all Humility, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and Subjection, preſent our ſelves before you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And have given me in charge from all this Noble Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly to declare unto You, the good Will and hearty deſire they have, with a moſt fervent Reſolution to Serve, Obey, and Aid You in all your Affairs, Commandments, and Pleaſures.</hi> All this Speech is nothing elſe but a Declaration of their good Will towards the King, and of their humble Obedience and Loyalty.</p>
                  <p>The like Speech was uſed in the Parliament at <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi> to <hi>Charles</hi> the 9th, when he was ſcarce Eleven Years old.</p>
                  <p>Neither are the Parliaments in <hi>Spain</hi> otherwiſe holden, but that even a greater Obedience of all the People is given to the King; as is to be ſeen in the Acts of the Parliament at <hi>Toledo</hi> by King <hi>Philip,</hi> 1552. when he yet was ſcarce Twenty Five Years old. The Anſwers alſo of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> unto the Requeſts and humble Supplications of his People, are given in theſe words: <hi>We will,</hi> or elſe, <hi>We Decree or Ordain</hi>; yea, the Subſidies that the Subjects pay unto the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> they call <hi>Service.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Parliaments of <hi>England,</hi> which have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly been holden every Third Year, the Eſtates ſeem to have a great Liberty, (as the Northern People
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:93433:172"/>
almoſt all breathe thereafter) yet ſo it is, that in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect they proceed not, but by way of Supplications and Requeſts to the King. As in the Parliament holden in <hi>Octob.</hi> 1566. when the Eſtates by a common Conſent had reſolved (as they gave the Queen to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand) not to Treat of any thing, until She had firſt Appointed who ſhould Succeed Her in the Crown; She gave them no other Anſwer, but <hi>That they were not to make her Grave before ſhe were Dead.</hi> All whoſe Reſolutions were to no purpoſe without Her good liking, neither did She in that any thing that they requeſted.</p>
                  <p>Albeit by the Sufferance of the King of <hi>England,</hi> Controverſies between the King and his People are ſometimes determined by the High Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet all the Eſtates remain in full ſubjection to the King, who is no way bound to follow their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, neither to conſent to their Requeſts.</p>
                  <p>The Eſtates of <hi>England</hi> are never otherwiſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, no more than they are in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> than by Parliament-Writs and expreſs Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, proceeding from the King; which ſheweth very well, that the Eſtates have no Power of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Determine, Command, or Decree any thing; ſeeing they cannot ſo much as Aſſemble themſelves, neither being Aſſembled, Depart without expreſs Commandment from the King.</p>
                  <p>Yet this may ſeem one ſpecial thing, that the Laws made by the King of <hi>England,</hi> at the Requeſt of the Eſtates, cannot be again repealed, but by calling a Parliament; though we ſee <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth to have always uſed his Soveraign Power, and with his only word to have diſannulled the Decrees of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="299" facs="tcp:93433:172"/>We conclude the Majeſty of a Prince to be nothing altered or diminiſhed by the Calling together, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Eſtates: But to the contrary, His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty thereby to be much the Greater and the more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, ſeeing all His People to acknowledge Him for their Soveraign.</p>
                  <p>We ſee the principal Point of Soveraign Majeſty and Abſolute Power to conſiſt principally in giving Laws unto the Subjects without their Conſent. It behoveth, that the Soveraign Prince ſhould have the Laws in his Power, to Change and Amend them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as Occaſion ſhall require.</p>
                  <p>In a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> every one in particular muſt ſwear to the Obſervation of the Laws, and their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to One Soveraign <hi>Monarch</hi>; who, next unto God, (of whom he holds his Scepter and Power) is bound to No Man: For an Oath carrieth always with it Reverence unto whom, and in whoſe Name it is made, as ſtill given to a Superiour; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Vaſſal gives ſuch Oath unto his Lord, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives None from Him again, though they be mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Bound, the One of them to the Other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Trajan</hi> ſwore to keep the Laws, although he under the name of a Soveraign Prince was exempted; but never any of the Emperours before him ſo ſware: Therefore <hi>Pliny</hi> the Younger, in a <hi>Panegyrical Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> ſpeaking of the Oath of <hi>Trajan,</hi> gives out, <hi>A great Novelty,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and never before heard of, He ſweareth, by whom we ſwear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of theſe two things the one muſt come to paſs, to wit, the Prince that ſwears to keep the Laws of his Country, muſt either not have the Soveraignty, or elſe become a Perjur'd Man, if he ſhould Abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:93433:173"/>
but one Law contrary to his Oath; whereas it is not only Profitable that a Prince ſhould ſometimes Abrogate ſome ſuch Laws, but alſo Neceſſary for him to Alter or Correct them, as the infinite Variety of Places, Times and Perſons ſhall require: Or if we ſhall ſay, the Prince to be ſtill a Soveraign, and yet nevertheleſs with ſuch conditions, that he can make no Law without the Advice of his Councel or People; He muſt alſo be Diſpenſed with by his Subjects, for the Oath which he hath made for the Obſervation of the Laws; and the Subjects again which are obliged to the Laws, have alſo need to be Diſpenſed withal by their Prince, for fear they ſhould be Perjur'd: So ſhall it come to paſs, that the Majeſty of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweal enclining now to this ſide, now to that ſide; ſometimes the Prince, ſometimes the People bearing ſway, ſhall have no Certainty to reſt upon; which are notable Abſurdities, and altogether incompatible with the Majeſty of Abſolute Soveraignty, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary both to Law and Reaſon. And yet we ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men, that think they ſee more in the matter than others, will maintain it to be moſt Neceſſary, that Princes ſhould be bound by Oath, to keep the Laws and Cuſtoms of their Countreys: In which doing, they weaken and overthrow all the Rights of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Majeſty, which ought to be moſt Sacred and Holy, and confound the Soveraignty of One Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign <hi>Monarch,</hi> with an <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> or <hi>Democracy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Publication, or Approbation of Laws, in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the Eſtates or Parliament, is with us of great importance for the keeping of the Laws; not that the Prince cannot of himſelf make a Law, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Conſent of the Eſtates or People (for even
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:93433:173"/>
all his Declarations of War, Treaties of Peace, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luations of the Coin, Charters to enable Towns to ſend Burgeſſes to Parliament, and his Writ of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to both Houſes to Aſſemble, are Laws, though made without the Conſent of the Eſtates or People;) but it is a Courteous part to do it by the good liking of the Senate.</p>
                  <p>What if a Prince by Law forbid to Kill or Steal, is he not Bound to obey his own Laws? I ſay, that this Law is not His, but the Law of God, whereunto all Princes are more ſtraitly bound than their Subjects; God taketh a ſtricter account of Princes than others, as <hi>Solomon</hi> a King hath ſaid; whereto agreeth <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Aurelius,</hi> ſaying, <hi>The Magiſtrates are Judges over private men, Princes judge the Magiſtrates, and God the Princes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not only a Law of Nature, but alſo oftentimes repeated among the Laws of God, that we ſhould be Obedient unto the Laws of ſuch Princes, as it hath pleaſed God to ſet to Rule and Reign over us; if their Laws be not directly Repugnant unto the Laws of God, whereunto all Princes are as well bound as their Subjects: For as the Vaſſal oweth his Oath of Fidelity unto his Lord, towards and againſt all men, except his Soveraign Prince: So the Subject oweth his Obedience to his Soveraign Prince, towards and againſt all, the Majeſty of God excepted, who is the Abſolute Soveraign of All the Princes in the World.</p>
                  <p>To confound the ſtate of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> with the <hi>Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> or <hi>Ariſtocratical</hi> eſtate, is a thing impoſſible, and in effect incompatible, and ſuch as cannot be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: For Soveraignty being of it ſelf Indiviſible, How can it at one and the ſame time be Divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:93433:174"/>
One Prince, the Nobility, and the People in common? The firſt Mark of Soveraign Majeſty is, to be of Power to give Laws, and to Command over them unto the Subjects: And who ſhould thoſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects be that ſhould yield their Obedience to the Law, if they ſhould have alſo Power to make the Laws? Who ſhould He be that could Give the Law, being he himſelf conſtrain'd to Receive it of them, unto whom he himſelf Gave it? So that of neceſſity we muſt conclude, that as no One in particular hath the Power to make the Law in ſuch a State, that there the State muſt needs be Popular.</p>
                  <p>Never any Commonwealth hath been made of an <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> and Popular Eſtate, much leſs of all the Three Eſtates of a Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>Such States, wherein the Right of Soveraignty is Divided are not rightly to be called Commonweals, but rather the Corruption of Commonweals; as <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus</hi> hath moſt briefly but truly written.</p>
                  <p>Commonweals which change their State, the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Right and Power of them being Divided, find no reſt from Civil Wars.</p>
                  <p>If the Prince be an Abſolute Soveraign, as are the true <hi>Monarchs</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> of <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Turkey, Muſcovy, Tartary, Perſia, Aethiopia, India,</hi> and almoſt of all the Kingdoms of <hi>Africk</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi>; where the Kings themſelves have the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, without all doubt or queſtion, not Divided with their Subjects: In this caſe it is not lawful for any One of the Subjects in particular, or all of them in general, to attempt any thing, either by way of Fact or of Juſtice, againſt the Honour, Life, or Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Soveraign, albeit he had committed all the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:93433:174"/>
Wickedneſs, Impiety, and Cruelty that could be ſpoke. For as to proceed againſt Him by way of Juſtice, the Subject hath not ſuch Juriſdiction over his Soveraign Prince, of whom dependeth all Power to Command, and who may not only Revoke all the Power of his Magiſtrates, but even in whoſe Preſence the Power of all Magiſtrates, Corporations, Eſtates and Communities ceaſe.</p>
                  <p>Now if it be not lawful for the Subject by the way of Juſtice to proceed againſt a King, How ſhould it then be lawful to proceed againſt him by way of Fact or Force? For queſtion is not here what men are able to do by Strength and Force, but what they ought of Right to do; as not whether the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject have Power and Strength, but whether they have lawful Power to Condemn their Soveraign Prince.</p>
                  <p>The Subject is not only guilty of Treaſon in the higheſt Degree, who hath Slain his Soveraign Prince, but even he alſo which hath Attempted the ſame, who hath given Counſel or Conſent thereto; yea, if he have Concealed the ſame, or but ſo much as Thought it: Which Fact the Laws have in ſuch Deteſtation, as that when a man guilty of any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence or Crime, dyeth before he be condemned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he is deemed to have died in whole and perfect Eſtate, except he have conſpired againſt the Life and Dignity of his Soveraign Prince. This only thing they have thought to be ſuch, as that for which he may worthily ſeem to have been now already judged and Condemned; yea, even before he was thereof Accuſed. And albeit the Laws inflict no Puniſhment upon the Evil Thoughts of men, but on thoſe only
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:93433:175"/>
which by Word or Deed break out into ſome Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; yet if any man ſhall ſo much as conceit a Thought for the Violating of the Perſon of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Prince, although he have Attempted nothing, they have yet Judged this ſame Thought worthy of Death, notwithſtanding what Repentance ſoever he have had thereof.</p>
                  <p>Leſt any men ſhould think [Kings or Princes] themſelves to have been the Authors of theſe Laws, ſo the more ſtraitly to provide for their own Safety and Honour; let us ſee the Laws and Examples of Holy <hi>Scripture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nabuchodonoſor</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> with Fire and Sword deſtroyed all the Country of <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> took it, rob'd and razed it down to the ground, burnt the <hi>Temple,</hi> and defiled the <hi>Sanctuary of God,</hi> ſlew the King, with the greateſt part of the people, carrying away the reſt into Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity into <hi>Babylon,</hi> cauſed the Image of himſelf made in Gold to be ſet up in Publick place, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all men to Adore and Worſhip the ſame, upon pain of being Burnt alive, and cauſed them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed ſo to do, to be caſt into a burning <hi>Furnace.</hi> And yet for all that, the holy Prophets [<hi>Baruch</hi> 1. <hi>Jeremy</hi> 29.] directing their Letters unto their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the <hi>Jews,</hi> then in Captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> will them to pray unto God for the good and happy Life of <hi>Nabuchodonoſor</hi> and his Children, and that they might ſo long Rule and Reign over them, as the Heavens ſhould endure: Yea even God himſelf doubted not to call <hi>Nabuchodonoſor</hi> his Servant, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That he would make him the moſt Mighty Prince of the world</hi>; and yet was there never a more dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:93433:175"/>
Tyrant than he: who not contented to be Himſelf Worſhipped, but cauſed his Image alſo to be Adored, and that upon pain of being burnt quick.</p>
                  <p>We have another rare Example of <hi>Saul,</hi> who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with an evil Spirit, cauſed the Prieſts of the <hi>Lord</hi> to be without juſt Cauſe ſlain, for that one of them had received <hi>David</hi> flying from him; and did what in his power was to kill, or cauſe to be kill'd, the ſame <hi>David,</hi> a moſt innocent Prince, by whom he had got ſo many Victories; at which time he fell twice himſelf into <hi>David</hi>'s Hands: who blamed of his Souldiers for that he would not ſuffer his ſo mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Enemy, then in his power, to be Slain, being in aſſured Hope to have enjoyed the Kingdom after his Death; he deteſted their Counſel, ſaying, <hi>God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that I ſhould ſuffer the Perſon of a King, the Lords Anointed, to be violated.</hi> Yea, he himſelf defended the ſame King perſecuting of him, whenas he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Souldiers of his Guard, overcome by Wine and Sleep, to be wakened.</p>
                  <p>And at ſuch time as <hi>Saul</hi> was ſlain, and that a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, thinking to do <hi>David</hi> a pleaſure, preſented him with <hi>Saul</hi>'s Head; <hi>David</hi> cauſed the ſame Souldier to be Slain, which had brought him the Head, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Go thou Wicked, How durſt thou lay thy impure Hands upon the Lords Anointed? Thou ſhalt ſurely Die therefore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And afterwards, without all Diſſimulation, mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Himſelf for the dead King. All which is worth good conſideration: for <hi>David</hi> was by <hi>Saul</hi> proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted to Death, and yet wanted not Power to have revenged Himſelf, being become Stronger than the
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:93433:176"/>
King; beſides, he was the Choſen of God, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed by <hi>Samuel</hi> to be King, and had Married the King's Daughter: And yet for all that, he abhorred to take upon him the Title of a King, and much more to Attempt any thing againſt the Life or Honour of <hi>Saul,</hi> or to Rebel againſt him; but choſe rather to Baniſh himſelf out of the Realm, than in any ſort to ſeek the Kings Deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>We doubt not but <hi>David,</hi> a King and a Prophet, led by the Spirit of God, had always before his Eyes the Law of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.28. <hi>Thou ſhalt not speak Evil of thy Prince, nor detract the Magiſtrate</hi>; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any thing more common in Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, than the forbidding not only to Kill or At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the Life or Honour of a Prince, but even for the very Magiſtrates, although, ſaith the Scripture, <hi>They be Wicked and Naught.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> before they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into Arms againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> if it were Lawful for them ſo to do, or not; who frankly told them, That it was not Lawful, whatſoever Tyranny or Impiety were pretended: yet was he not therein by them Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; ſo thereof enſued a Deadly and moſt Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table War, the End whereof was moſt Miſerable; drawing with it, the Ruine of many great and noble Houſes of <hi>Germany,</hi> with exceeding ſlaughter of the Subjects.</p>
                  <p>The Prince, whom you may juſtly call the Father of the Country, ought to be to every man Dearer and more Reverend than any Father, as one Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Sent unto us by God. The Subject is never to be ſuffered to Attempt any thing againſt the
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:93433:176"/>
Prince, how Naughty and Cruel ſoever he be: law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful it is, not to obey him in things contrary to the Laws of God, to Flie and Hide our ſelves from him; but yet to ſuffer Stripes, yea, and Death alſo, rather than to Attempt any thing againſt his Life and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. O how many Tyrants ſhould there be, if it ſhould be lawful for Subjects to kill Tyrants? How many good and innocent Princes ſhould as Tyrants periſh by the Conſpiracy of their Subjects againſt them? He that ſhould of his Subjects but exact Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies, ſhould be then, as the Vulgar People eſteem him, a Tyrant: He that ſhould Rule and Command contrary to the good Liking of the People, ſhould be a Tyrant: He that ſhould keep ſtrong Guards and Garriſons for the ſafety of his Perſon, ſhould be a Tyrant: He that ſhould put to death Traitors and Conſpirators againſt his State, ſhould be alſo counted a Tyrant. How ſhould good Princes be aſſured of their Lives, if under colour of Tyranny they might be Slain by their Subjects, by whom they ought to be Defended?</p>
                  <p>In a well-ordered State, the Soveraign Power muſt remain in One onely, without Communicating any part thereof unto the State, (for in that caſe it ſhould be a Popular Government, and no <hi>Monarchy.)</hi> Wiſe <hi>Politicians, Philoſophers, Divines,</hi> and <hi>Hiſtoriographers,</hi> have highly commended a <hi>Monarchy</hi> above all other Commonweals. It is not to pleaſe the Prince, that they hold this Opinion; but for the Safety and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the Subjects. And contrariwiſe, when as they ſhall Limit and Reſtrain the Soveraign Power of a <hi>Monarch,</hi> to Subject him to the General Eſtates, or to the Council; the Soveraignty hath no firm Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:93433:177"/>
but they frame a Popular Confuſion, or a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable <hi>Anarchy,</hi> which is the Plague of all Eſtates and Commonweals: The which muſt be duly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, not giving credit to their goodly Diſcourſes, which perſwade Subjects, that it is neceſſary to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <hi>Monarchs,</hi> and to give their Prince a Law; for that is not only the Ruine of the <hi>Monarch,</hi> but alſo of the Subjects. It is yet more ſtrange, that many hold Opinion, that the Prince is ſubject to his Laws, that is to ſay, ſubject to his Will, whereon the Laws which he hath made, depend; a thing impoſſible in Nature. And under this Colour, and ill-digeſted Opinion, they make a mixture and confuſion of Civil Laws, with the Laws of Nature and of God.</p>
                  <p>A pure Abſolute <hi>Monarchy</hi> is the fureſt Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal, and without Compariſon, the Beſt of all. Wherein many are abuſed, who maintain that an <hi>Optimacy</hi> is the beſt kind of Government; for that many Commanders have more Judgment, Wiſdom, and Counſel, than One alone. For there is a great difference betwixt Councel and Commandment.</p>
                  <p>The Councel of Many wiſe men may be better than of One; But to Reſolve, Determine, and to Command, One will always perform it better than Many: He which hath adviſedly digeſted All their Opinions, will ſoon Reſolve without Contention; the which Many cannot eaſily perform: It is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to have a Soveraign Prince, which may have Power to Reſolve and Determine of the Opinions of his Council.</p>

                  <p>Such as ſhall not be pleaſed with this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate, are left to their liberty to conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:93433:178"/>
all thoſe Proofs and Preſumptions numbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up by Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> for the Conviction of a Witch, be not all condemned, or confeſſed by himſelf to be unſufficient or uncertain.</p>
                  <p>He brings no leſs than eighteen Signs or Proofs, whereby a <hi>Witch</hi> may be diſcovered, which are too many to be all true: his ſeven firſt he himſelf confeſſeth to be inſufficient for Conviction of a <hi>Witch;</hi> His eight next Proofs (which he ſaith men in place have uſed) he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth to be falſe or inſufficient. Thus of his eighteen Proofs, which made a great ſhow, fifteen of them are cast off by himſelf; there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains then his ſixteenth, which is the Confeſſion of a <hi>Witch;</hi> yet preſently he is forced to yield, That a bare Confeſſion is not a ſufficient proof, and ſo he cometh to his ſeventeenth proof, which is, two credible Witneſſes; and he here grants, That the League between the Devil and the <hi>Witch</hi> is cloſely made, and the Practices of <hi>Witches</hi> be very ſecret, that hardly a man can be brought, which upon his own knowledge can averr ſuch things. Therefore at last, when all other proofs fail, he is forced to fly to his eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth proof, and tells us, that yet there is a way to come to the knowledge of a <hi>Witch,</hi> which is, that <hi>Satan</hi> uſeth all means to diſcover a <hi>Witch;</hi> which how it can be well done, except the Devil be bound over to give in Evidence
<pb facs="tcp:93433:178"/>
againſt the <hi>Witch,</hi> cannot be underſtood.</p>
                  <p>And as Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> weakens and diſcredits all his own Proofs, ſo he doth the like for all thoſe of King <hi>James,</hi> who, as I remember, hath but Three Arguments for the diſcovery of a <hi>Witch.</hi> First, the ſecret Mark of a <hi>Witch,</hi> of which Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſaith, it hath no power by Gods Ordinance. Secondly, The diſcovery by a fellow-<hi>Witch;</hi> this Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> by no means will allow to be a good proof. Thirdly, The ſwimming of a <hi>Witch,</hi> who is to be flung croſs-ways into the water, that is, as <hi>Wierus</hi> interprets it, when the Thumb of the right Hand is bound to the great Toe of the left Foot, and the Thumb of the left Hand to the great Toe of the right Foot. Against this Tryal by water, together with a diſability in a <hi>Witch</hi> to ſhed Tears, (which King <hi>James</hi> mentions) <hi>Delrio</hi> and Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> both argue; for it ſeems they both writ after King <hi>James,</hi> who put forth his Book of Daemonologie in his youth, being in <hi>Scotland,</hi> about his age of thirty years.</p>
                  <p>It concerns the People of this Nation to be more diligently inſtructed in the Doctrine of Witchcraft, than thoſe of Foreign Countries, becauſe here they are tyed to a ſtricter or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter Rule in giving their Sentence than others are: for all of them muſt agree in their Verdict,
<pb facs="tcp:93433:179"/>
which in a caſe of extreme difficulty is very dangerous; and it is a ſad thing for men to be reduced to that extremity, that they must ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard their Conſciences or their Lives.</p>

                     <hi>The Witch Condemned by our Statute-Law is, 1 <hi>Jacob. Cap.</hi> 12.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One that ſhall uſe, practiſe, or exerciſe any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation or Conjuration of any evil or wicked Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or conſult, covenant with, entertain or employ, féed or reward any evil or wicked Spirit, to or for any intent or purpoſe; or take up any dead man, woman, or child, out of his, her, or their grave, or any other place, where the dead body reſteth; or the skin, bone, or other part of any dead per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to be employed or uſed in any manner of Witchcraft, Sorcery, Charm or Enchantment;

                  <div type="section">
                     <head>In this Statute theſe Points are obſervable.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. That this Statute was firſt framed in 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and only the Penalties here a little altered, and the laſt clauſe concerning provoking of Perſons to love, and deſtroying of Cattle and Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is ſo changed, that I cannot well make ſenſe of it, except it be rectified according to the words of the former Statute which ſtands repealed.</p>

                        <pb n="315" facs="tcp:93433:180"/>2. Although the Statute runs altogether in the disjunctive <hi>Or,</hi> and ſo makes every ſingle crime capital, yet the Judges uſually by a favourable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, take the disjunctive <hi>Or,</hi> for the copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative <hi>And</hi>; and therefore ordinarily they condemn none for Witches, unleſs they be charged with the Murdering of ſome perſons.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This Statute preſuppoſeth that every one knows what a Conjurer, a Witch, an Inchanter, a Charmer, and Sorcerer is, as being to be learned beſt of Divines; and therefore it hath not deſcribed or diſtinguiſhed between them: and yet the Law is very juſt in requiring <hi>a due and lawful Conviction.</hi>

                     <head>The Definition of Witchcraft.</head>
                     <p>FOR the better diſcovery of the qualities of theſe crimes, I ſhall ſpend ſome diſcourſe upon the Definition of thoſe Arts by Divines: for both thoſe of the Reformed Churches, as well as thoſe of the Roman, in a manner, agree in their definition of the ſin of Witchcraft. I ſhall inſtance in two late Writers, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>William Perkins</hi> in his Diſcourſe of Witchcraft, and in <hi>Martin Delrio,</hi> a Jeſuit of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> in his Book of <hi>Magical Diſquiſitions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our Engliſh word <hi>Witch,</hi> is derived from the Dutch word <hi>Wiechelen,</hi> or <hi>Wijchelen,</hi> which doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſignifie <hi>whinying</hi> or <hi>neighing</hi> like a Horſe, and doth alſo ſignifie to foretel or propheſie; and <hi>Wei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheler</hi> ſignifies a <hi>Soothſayer</hi>; for that the <hi>Germans,</hi> from whom our Anceſtors the <hi>Saxons</hi> deſcended, uſually and principally did, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> tells us, <hi>divine and foretel things to come, by the whinying and neighing of their Horſes. Hinnitu &amp; fremitu</hi> are his words.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="316" facs="tcp:93433:181"/>For the Definition Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſaith, <hi>Witchcraft is an Art ſerving for the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Wonders,</hi>
                        <note rend="inter">Cap. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>by the aſſiſtance of the Devil, ſo far as God ſhall permit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Delrio</hi> defineth it to be an <hi>Art, which by the power of a Contract entred into with the Devil,</hi>
                        <note rend="inter">Lib. 1. Cap. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>ſome Wonders are wrought which paſs the common underſtanding of men. Ars quâ vi pacti cum Daemonibus initi mira quaedam communem hominum captum ſuperantia efficiuntur.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In theſe two Definitions, ſome Points are worth the noting.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They both agree in the main Foundation, which is a Contract with the Devil, and therefore Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> thought it moſt neceſſary, that this main Point ſhould be proved; to which purpoſe he promiſeth to define a Witch, by <hi>opening the nature of Witchcraft,</hi>
                        <note rend="inter">Cap. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>as it is delivered in the Old and New Teſtament</hi>; and yet after he confeſſeth a <hi>manifeſt Covenant is not ſo fully ſet down in Scripture:</hi>
                        <note rend="inter">Cap. 2.</note> And out of the <hi>New Testament</hi> he offers no proof at all, though he promiſed it; nevertheleſs, he reſolves us that <hi>a Covenant is a moſt evident and certain truth, that may not be called in queſtion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For proof of a Covenant, he produceth only one Text out of the Old Teſtament; neither doth he ſay, that the Text proveth a Contract with the Devil, but only that it <hi>intimateth</hi> ſo much: Thus at the firſt he falls from a proof to an intimation only. The Text is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58. <hi>v.</hi> 5. of which his words are theſe:<note rend="inter">Cap. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Howſoever the common Tranſlation runneth in other terms, yet the words are properly to be read thus: Which hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:93433:181"/>
not the voice of the mutterer joyning Societies cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly—the main foundation of the Charm, Societies or Confederacies cunningly made, not between man and man, but, as the words import, between the Enchanter and the Devil,</hi> Deut. 18.11.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Though there be neither mention of Spirit or Devil in this Pſalm, yet Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> would have us believe that there can be no <hi>conjoyning or conſociating</hi> but with the Devil: but Mr. <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> as great a <hi>Rabbi</hi> as Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> finds other Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of this Text; and though he mentions fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the Devil, yet he puts it in the third and laſt place, as the neweſt and lateſt Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for he teacheth us, That <hi>the Enchanter had his title both in</hi> Pſal. 58. <hi>and in</hi> Deut. 18. <hi>either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he aſſociates Serpents, making them tame and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar that they hurt not, or becauſe ſuch perſons uſe to bind and tye bonds, or things about the body, to heal or hurt by Sorcery.</hi> Alſo he teacheth us, That a <hi>Charmer</hi> doth joyn or <hi>speak words of a strange language, and without ſenſe, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Delrio</hi> it ſeems puts no confidence in this Text of Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> for he doth not cite it to prove a Contract; yet he hath alſo one Text of his own to that purpoſe, it is <hi>Eſay</hi> 28.15. where it is ſaid,<note rend="inter">Lib. 2. Qu. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>We have made a Covenant with Death, and with Hell we are at an agreement; Percuſſimus foedus cum morte, &amp; cum inferno fecimus pactum.</hi> And <hi>Delrio</hi> tells us, That <hi>Tho. Aquinas</hi> did apply this Text to Witches, <hi>magis ſatis probabili interpretatione.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> If this Text be conſidered, it proves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all: for it doth not charge the proud and drunken <hi>Ephraimites,</hi> of whom it is ſpoken that
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:93433:182"/>
they had made an agreement with Hell, but it is only a falſe brag of their own, to juſtifie their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs by a lye: for it is not poſſible to make a Covenant with Death, which in it ſelf is nothing but a meer not being; and whereas it is called an agreement with Hell, it may be tranſlated as well, if not better in this place, an <hi>agreement with the Grave</hi>; and ſo the Interlineary Bible hath it; and <hi>Tremelius</hi> and <hi>Junius</hi> render it, <hi>Pepigimus foedus cum morte, &amp; cum ſepulchro egimus cautum</hi>; which they term a <hi>Thraſonical Hyperbole:</hi> and <hi>Deodatus</hi> his <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Bible</hi> hath, <hi>Habbiamo fatto lega col ſepolcro</hi>; ſo likewiſe the <hi>Spaniſh Bible</hi> tranſlates it, <hi>Concierto tenemos hecho con la muerte, è con la ſepultura hazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos acuerdo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It may be wondered, that neither Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> nor the Jeſuit have any other or better Texts to prove this Contract between the Witch and the Devil. But the truth is, it is very little that either of them ſay of this great point, but paſs it over perfunctorily. Perhaps it may be thought that King <hi>James</hi> hath ſaid, or brought more and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proofs in this point; but I do not find that he doth meddle with it at all, but takes it for granted, that if there be Witches, there muſt needs be a Covenant, and ſo leaves it without further proof.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond note is, That the agreement between the Witch and the Devil, they call a Covenant, and yet neither of the parties are any way bound to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their part; and the Devil, without doubt, notwithſtanding all his craft, hath far the worſt part of the bargain. The bargain runs thus in Mr. <hi>Perkins:</hi>
                        <note rend="inter">Cap. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>The Witch as a ſlave binds
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:93433:182"/>
himſelf by Vow to believe in the Devil, and to give him either Body, or Soul, or both, under his hand-writing, or ſome part of his Blood. The Devil promiſeth to be ready at his vaſſals command to appear in the likeneſs of any Creature, to conſult, and to aid him for the procuring of Pleaſure, Honour, Wealth, or Preferment; to go for him, to carry him any whither, and to do any command.</hi> Whereby we ſee the Devil is not to have benefit of his bargain till the death of the Witch; in the mean time he is to appear always at the Witches command, to go for him, to carry him any whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to do any command: which argues the Devil to be the Witches ſlave, and not the Witch the Devils.</p>
                     <p>Though it be true which <hi>Delrio</hi> affirmeth, <hi>That the Devil is at liberty to perform or break his compact, for that no man can compel him to keep his promiſe</hi>; yet on the other ſide, it is as poſſible for the Witch to fruſtrate the Devils Contract, if he or ſhe have ſo much grace as to repent; the which there may be good cauſe to do, if the Devil be found not to perform his promiſe. Beſides, a Witch may many times require that to be done by the Devil, which God permits not the Devil to do; thus againſt his will the Devil may loſe his credit, and give occaſion of repentance, though he endeavour to the utmoſt of his power to bring to paſs whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he hath promiſed; and ſo fail of the benefit of his bargain, though he have the Hand-writing, or ſome part of the blood of the Witch for his ſecurity, or the ſolemnity before Witneſſes, as <hi>Delrio</hi> imagineth.</p>
                     <p>I am certain they will not ſay, that Witchcraft is like the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:93433:183"/>
for Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> confeſſeth the contrary, and <hi>Delrio</hi> denies it not;<note rend="inter">
                           <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Sect.</hi> 18.</note> for he allows the <hi>Sacrament of the Eucharist</hi> to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to a condemned VVitch, with this limitation, that there may be about four hours ſpace between the Communion and the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, in which time it may be probably thought, that the <hi>Sacramental Species</hi> (as they call it) may be conſumed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Delrio</hi> in his ſecond Book, and fourth Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, gives this Rule, which he ſaith <hi>is common to all Contracts with the Devil, That firſt they muſt deny the Faith, and Christianiſm, and Obedience to God, and reject the Patronage of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>and revile her.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> affirms, that <hi>Witches renounce God and their Baptiſm.</hi> But if this be common to all Contracts with the Devil, it will follow, that none can be VVitches but ſuch as have firſt been Chriſtians, nay and <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> if <hi>Delrio</hi> ſay true; for who elſe can renounce the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage of the Virgin <hi>Mary?</hi> And what ſhall be ſaid then of all thoſe Idolatrous Nations of <hi>Lapland, Finland,</hi> and of divers parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> and many other Heatheniſh Nations, which our Travellers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to be full of VVitches? And indeed, what need or benefit can the Devil gain by contracting with thoſe Idolaters, who are ſurer his own, than any Covenant can make them?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. VVhereas it is ſaid, That <hi>Witchcraft is an Art working Wonders,</hi> it muſt be underſtood, that the Art muſt be the VVitches Art, and not the Devils, otherwiſe it is no Witchcraft, but Devils-craft. It is confeſſed on all hands, That the Witch doth not work the wonder, but the Devil only.
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:93433:183"/>
It is a rare Art for a Witch by her Art to be able to do nothing her ſelf, but to command ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to practiſe the Art. In other Arts, Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>That the Arts Master is able by himſelf to practiſe his Art, and to do things belonging thereunto,</hi>
                        <note rend="inter">Cap. 1. Sect. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>without the help of another; but in this it is otherwiſe— the power of effecting strange works doth not flow from the skill of the Witch, but is derived wholly from Satan.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe he ſaith,<note rend="inter">Cap. 4. Sect. 1.</note> That <hi>the means of working wonders are Charms uſed as a Watch-word to the Devil to cauſe him to work wonders:</hi> ſo that the Devil is the Worker of the wonder, and the Witch but the Counſellour, Perſwader, or Commander of it, and only acceſſory before the Fact, and the Devil only principal. Now the difficulty will be, how the <hi>acceſſory</hi> can be <hi>duly and lawfully convicted and attainted</hi> according as our Statute requires, unleſs the Devil, who is the Principal, be firſt convicted, or at leaſt outlawed; which cannot be, becauſe the Devil can never be lawfully ſummoned according to the Rules of our Common Law. For further proof that the Devil is the Principal in all ſuch wonders, I ſhall ſhew it by the teſtimony of King <hi>James,</hi> in a Caſe of Murder, which is the moſt capital Crime our Laws look upon. Firſt, he tells us, That <hi>the Devil teaches Witches how to make Pictures of Wax and Clay, that by the roaſting thereof, the perſons that they bear the Name of, may be continually melted, or dried away by continual ſickneſs—not that any of theſe means which he teacheth them (except poiſons, which are compoſed of things natural) can of themſelves help
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:93433:184"/>
any thing to theſe turns they are imployed in.</hi> Secondly,<note rend="inter">Lib. 2. Cap. 5.</note> King <hi>James</hi> affirms, That <hi>Witches can bewitch, and take the life of men or women by roaſting of the Pictures, which is very poſſible to their Maſter to perform: for although that inſtrument of Wax have no vertue in the turn do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet may he not very well, by that ſame meaſure that his conjured Slave melts that Wax at the fire, may he not, I ſay, at theſe ſame times, ſubtilly as a Spirit, ſo weaken and ſcatter the ſpirits of life of the Patient, as may make him on the one part for faintneſs to ſweat out the humours of his body; and on the other part, for the not concurring of theſe ſpirits which cauſe his digeſtion, ſo debilitate his ſtomach, that his humour radical continually ſweating out on the one part, and no new good Suck being put in the place thereof for lack of digeſtion on the other, he at last ſhall vaniſh away even as his Picture will do at the Fire?</hi> Here we ſee the Picture of Wax, roaſted by the Witch, hath no virtue in the Murdering, but the Devil only. It is neceſſary in the firſt place that it be duly proved, that the party murdered be murdered by the Devil: for it is a ſhame to bely the Devil; and it is not poſſible to be proved, if it be <hi>ſubtilly done as a Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. Our Definers of Witchcraft diſpute much, whether the Devil can work a Miracle: they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve he can do a <hi>Wonder,</hi> but not a <hi>Miracle; Mirum,</hi> but not <hi>Miraculum. A Miracle,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Perkins, is that which is above or againſt Nature ſimply; a Wonder is that which proceeds not from the ordinary courſe of Nature. Delrio</hi> will have a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to be <hi>praeter,</hi> or <hi>ſupra naturae creatae vires:</hi> both ſeem to agree in this, That he had need be an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:93433:184"/>
or profound Philoſopher, that can diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between a Wonder and a Miracle; it would poſe <hi>Aristotle</hi> himſelf, to tell us every thing that can be done by the power of Nature, and what things cannot; for there be daily many things found out, and daily more may be, which our Forefathers never knew to be poſſible in Nature. Thoſe that were converted by the Miracles of our Saviour, never ſtayed to inquire of their Philoſophers what the power of Nature was; it was ſufficient to them, when they ſaw things done, the like whereof they had neither ſeen nor heard of, to believe them to be Miracles.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. It is commonly believed and affirmed by Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> That the cauſe which moves the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to bargain with a Witch, is a deſire to obtain thereby the Soul and Body of the Witch. But I cannot ſee how this can agree with another Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of his, where he ſaith: <hi>The Precepts of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft are not delivered indifferently to every man, but to his own ſubjects the wicked; and not to them all, but to special and tryed ones, whom he most betruſteth with his ſecrets, as being the fitteſt to ſerve his turn, both in reſpect of their willingneſs to learn and practiſe, as alſo for their ability to become Inſtruments of the miſchief he intendeth to others.</hi> All this argues the end of the Devils rules of Witchcraft is not to gain <hi>Novices</hi> for new Subjects, but to make uſe of old ones to ſerve his turn.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The laſt clauſe of Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> Definition is, That <hi>Witchcraft doth work wonders ſo far as God ſhall permit.</hi> I ſhould here deſire to have known whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> had thought that God doth permit farther power to the Devil upon his contracting
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:93433:185"/>
with the Witch, than he had before the Contract: for if the Devil had the ſame permiſſion before the Contract, then he doth no more miſchief upon the Contract, then he would have gladly done before, ſeeing, as Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Devils malice towards all men is of ſo high a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi>

                        <hi>that he cannot endure they ſhould enjoy the World, or the benefits of this life (if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) ſo much as one hour.</hi> But yet afterwards I find Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> is more favourable to the Devil, where he writes, <hi>That if the Devil were not stirred up and provoked by the Witch, he would never do ſo much hurt as he doth.</hi>

                        <note rend="inter">Cap. 7. Sect. 1.</note>A <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Perkins, may not take upon him to examine whom and how he willeth of any Crime, nor to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon ſlight cauſes, or to ſhew his Authority, or upon ſiniſter reſpects, or to revenge his malice, or to bring parties into danger and ſuſpicion; but he muſt proceed upon ſpecial preſumptions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He calls thoſe <hi>preſumptions, which do at leaſt probably and conjecturally note one to be a Witch,</hi>
                        <note rend="inter">Cap. 7. Sect. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>and are certain ſigns whereby the Witch may be diſcovered.</hi> I cannot but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſhould ſay, That preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do at leaſt probably and conjecturally note, and are certain ſigns to diſcover a Witch; when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, That <hi>though preſumptions give occaſion to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, yet they are no ſufficient cauſes of conviction: and though preſumptions be never ſo ſtrong, yet they are not proofs ſufficient for Conviction, but only for Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</hi>
                        <pb n="325" facs="tcp:93433:185"/>
Therefore no credit is to be given to thoſe preſumptions he reckons up. 1. For common ſame, <hi>it falls out many times,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that the innocent may be ſuſpected, and ſome of the better ſort notoriouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed.</hi> 2. <hi>The teſtimony of a fellow Witch,</hi> he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, <hi>doth not probably note one to be a Witch.</hi> The like may be ſaid of his third and fourth preſumption, <hi>if after curſing, or quarrelling, or threatning, there follow preſent miſchief.</hi> And the fifth preſumption is more frivolous, which is, <hi>if the party be the Son or Daughter, or Servant, or Friend, near Neighbour, or old Companion of a Witch.</hi> The ſixth preſumption Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> dares not, or is loth to own, but ſaith, <hi>Some add, if the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſuſpected have the Devils Mark; and yet he reſolves, if ſuch a Mark be deſcried, whereof no evident reaſon in nature can be given, the Magiſtrate may cauſe ſuch to be examined, or take the matter into his own hands, that the truth may appear</hi>; but he doth not teach how the truth may be made to appear. The laſt preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he names, is, <hi>if the party examined be unconſtant, or contrary to himſelf</hi>; here he confeſſeth, <hi>a good man may be fearful in a good cauſe, ſometimes by nature, ſometimes in regard of the preſence of the Judge, or the greatneſs of the Audience; ſome may be ſuddenly taken, and others want that liberty of ſpeech which other men have.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Touching Examination, Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> names two kinds of proceedings, either by <hi>ſimple Queſtion,</hi> or <hi>by Torture: Torture, when beſides the enquiry by words, the Magiſtrate uſeth the Rack, or ſome other violent means to urge Confeſſion</hi>; this he ſaith, <hi>may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſed, howbeit not in every caſe, but only upon ſtrong and great preſumptions, and when the party is obſtinate.</hi> Here it may be noted, that it is not
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:93433:186"/>
lawful for any perſon, but the Judge only, to allow Torture: ſuſpicious Neighbours may not, of their own heads, uſe either Threats, Terrors, or Tortures. I know not any one of thoſe preſumptions before-cited, to be ſufficient to warrant a Magiſtrate to uſe Torture; or whether when the party conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denies the Fact, it muſt be counted obſtinacy. In caſe of Treaſon ſometimes, when the main Fact hath been either confeſſed, or by ſome infallible proofs manifeſted, the Magiſtrate, for a farther diſcovery of ſome circumſtance of the Time, the Place, and the Perſons, or the like, have made uſe of the Rack: and yet that kind of torture had not been of ancient uſage in this Kingdom; for if my memory fail not, I have read, that the Rack hath been called <hi>the Duke of</hi> Exeters <hi>Daughter, and was firſt uſed about</hi> Hen. 6. <hi>days.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From preſumptions, Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> proceeds to proofs of a Witch; and here he hath a neat di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of proofs, <hi>leſs ſufficient,</hi> or <hi>more ſufficient</hi>; by leſs ſufficient he meaneth inſufficient, but gives them this mild and ſtrange phraſe of leſs ſufficient, that it may not diſpleaſe ſuch friends as (I conceive) allow thoſe leſs ſufficient proofs for ſufficient, though he reckons them for no better than Witchcraft. Thoſe unſufficient ſufficient proofs are weaker and worſe than his preſumptions, which he confeſſeth are no proofs at all; yet we muſt reckon them up. His firſt leſs ſufficient proof is, <hi>The antient trial by taking red hot Irons, or putting the hand in hot ſcalding water</hi>; this, he ſaith, <hi>hath been condemned for Diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and wicked, as in truth it is: for an innocent man may thereby be condemned, and a rank Witch ſcape un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed.</hi> A ſecond inſufficient proof is, <hi>Scratching
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:93433:186"/>
of the ſuſpected party, and the preſent recovery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</hi> A third is, <hi>the burning the thing bewitched, as a Hog, an Ox, or other Creature, it is imagined a forcible means to cauſe the Witch to diſcover her ſelf.</hi> A fourth, <hi>is the burning the Thatch of the ſuspected parties Houſe.</hi> The fifth leſs ſufficient proof is, <hi>the binding of the party hand and foot, and casting croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways into the water; if ſhe ſinks, ſhe is counted inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; if ſhe float on the water and ſink not, ſhe is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a Witch, convicted, and puniſhed.</hi> The <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> uſed this Tryal by cold water; and it was imagined, that the Devil being moſt light, as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating more of Air than of Water, would hold them up above the Water, either by putting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under the Witch, and lifting her up, as it were with his back, or by uniting himſelf, and poſſeſſing her whole body.</p>
                     <p>All theſe leſs ſufficient proofs, ſaith Mr. <hi>Perkins, are ſo far from being ſufficient, that ſome of them, if not all, are after a ſort practices of Witchcraft, having no power by Gods Ordinance.</hi> Hereby he condemns point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blank King <hi>James</hi>'s judgment, as favouring of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, in allowing of the Tryal of a VVitch by ſwimming as a principal proof. And as I take it, he condemns himſelf alſo, except he can find any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, that the having of an incurable and inſenſible mark or ſore, ſhall be a preſumption, or certain ſign of a Witch.</p>
                     <p>A ſixth leſs ſufficient proof, is the <hi>Teſtimony of a Wizard, Witch, or cunning man, who is gone or ſent unto, and informs that he can ſhew in a glaſs the Face of the Witch.</hi> This accuſation of a Witch by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Witch, Mr. <hi>Perkins denies to be ſufficient; and he puts this caſe: If the Devil appear to a Grand Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:93433:187"/>
in the likeneſs of ſome known man, and offer to take his Oath that the perſon in queſtion is a Witch, ſhould the Enqueſt receive his Oath or accuſation to condemn the party? He anſwers, Surely no; and yet that is as much as the Teſtimony of another Witch, who only by the help of the Devil revealeth the Witch: if this ſhould be taken for a ſufficient proof, the Devil would not leave one good man alive in the world.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This diſcrediting of the Teſtimony of a Witch, takes away the other (for he hath but two) of King <hi>James</hi>'s main proofs for the diſcovery of a Witch, for he ſaith, <hi>who but Witches can be provers, and ſo witneſſes of the doings of Witches?</hi> and to the ſame purpoſe Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> himſelf confeſſeth, that the <hi>Precepts of Witchcraft are not delivered, but to the Devils own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the wicked.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A ſeventh leſs ſufficient proof is, <hi>when a man in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Court affirms, ſuch a one fell out with me, and curſed me, threatning I ſhould ſmart for it in my perſon or goods; upon theſe threats, ſuch Evils and Loſſes preſently befel me; this is no ſure ground for Conviction,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, for it pleaſeth God many times to lay his Hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mens perſons and goods, without the procurement of Witches</hi>; and yet ſaith Mr. <hi>Perkins, Experience ſhews, that ignorant People will make ſtrong proofs of ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions, whereupon ſometimes Jurors do give their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict againſt parties innocent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The laſt leſs ſufficient proof is, <hi>if a man being ſick, upon ſuſpicion will take it on his death, that ſuch a one hath bewitched him, it is of no moment,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Perkins; it is but the ſuſpicion of one man for himſelf, and is of no more force than another mans word againſt him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>All theſe proofs,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Perkins, which men in place have ordinarily uſed, be either falſe or inſufficient ſigns.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="329" facs="tcp:93433:187"/>At the laſt Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> comes to his <hi>more ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent proofs,</hi> which are in all but two. The confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Witch, or the proof of two witneſſes. Againſt the confeſſion of a Witch, Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, <hi>it is objected, that one may confeſs againſt himſelf an untruth,</hi>
                        <note rend="inter">Chap. 7. Sect. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>being urged by force or threatning, or by deſire upon ſome grief to be out of the World; or at leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in trouble, and perſwaded it is the best courſe to ſave their Lives and obtain their Liberty, they may upon ſimplicity be induced to confeſs that they never did, even againſt themſelves.</hi> The Truth of this Allegation Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> doth not deny, but grants it, in that his Anſwer is, <hi>That he doth not ſay a bare Confeſſion is ſufficient, but a Confeſſion after due Examination ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon pregnant preſumptions.</hi> But if a bare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion be not a ſufficient proof, a pregnant pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption can never make it ſuch; or if it could, then it would not be a ſufficient proof. For the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weakning of the Confeſſion of a ſuſpected Witch, we may remember what Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> hath formerly anſwered, when it was alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>upon a melancholy humour,</hi>
                        <note rend="inter">Chap. 7. Sect. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny confeſs of themſelves things falſe and impoſſible, That they are carried through the Air in a moment, that they paſs through key-holes and clefts of Doors; that they be ſometimes turn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Cats, Hares, and other Creatures, and ſuch like; all which are meer fables, and things impoſſible.</hi> Here Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> anſwers, that <hi>when Witches begin to make a League, they are ſober and ſound in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; but after they be once in the League, their reaſon &amp; underſtanding may be depraved, memory weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and all the powers of their Soul blemiſhed; they
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:93433:188"/>
are deluded, and ſo intoxicated, that they will run into a thouſand of phantaſtical imaginations, holding themſelves to be transformed into the ſhapes of other Creatures, to be tranſported in the Air, to do many ſtrange things which in truth they do not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> will confeſs, that the Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and confeſſion of a ſuſpected Witch, is always af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch time as her Covenant is made; when ſhe is by his Confeſſion deluded, and not fit to give teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt her ſelf.</p>
                     <p>His ſecond <hi>more ſufficient proof</hi> (he ſaith, <hi>if the party will not confeſs, as commonly it falleth out) is two witneſſes avouching upon their own knowledge, either that the party accuſed hath made League with the Devil, or hath done ſome known practices of Witchcraft, or hath invocated the Devil, or deſired his help.</hi> But if every man that hath invocated the Devil, or deſired his help, muſt have formerly made a League with him, then whole Nations are every man of them Witches; which I think none will ſay.</p>
                     <p>As for the League, and proof of Witchcraft, Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>Some may ſay, If theſe be the only strong proofs for the Conviction of a Witch, it will be then impoſſible to put any one to Death; becauſe the League with Satan is cloſely made, and the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Witchcraft are alſo very ſecret, and hardly can a man be brought, which upon his own knowledge can aver ſuch things.</hi> To this Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> anſwer is a confeſſion: that <hi>howſoever the ground and practice be ſecret, and be to many unknown, yet there is a way to come to the knowledge thereof.—Satan endeavoureth the diſcovery, and uſeth all means to diſcloſe Witches.</hi> This means he ſpeaks of ſhould be in the power of the Judge, or elſe it is no help for the diſcovery of
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:93433:188"/>
a Witch, but only when the Devil pleaſeth, I do not find he proves that it is uſual with Satan to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour any ſuch Diſcovery; neither do I ſee how it is practicable by the Devil: for either he muſt do it by his own relation or report; which as it cannot be proved he ever did, ſo it is vain, and to no purpoſe if he do it; for Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> hath diſcredited the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Devil, as invalid, and of no force for conviction: or elſe the Devil muſt diſcover it by ſome ſecond means; and if there had been any ſuch ſecond means uſual, Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> would have taught us what they are, and not have left us only to his two more ſufficient proofs, which he confeſſeth are not infallible.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>James</hi> tells us,<note rend="inter">Lib. 2. Cap. 2.</note> that the <hi>Devils firſt diſcovering of himſelf for the gaining of a Witch, is either upon their walking ſolitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Fields, or elſe lying pauſing in their bed, but always without the company of any other; and at the making of Circles and Conjurations, none of that craft will permit any others to behold</hi>; when the Devil and his Subjects are thus cloſe and ſecret in their actions, it cannot be imagined that he will uſe all means to diſcover his moſt ſpecial and truſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Subjects: and though Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> tells us, that <hi>by nature of the Precontract,</hi>
                        <note rend="inter">Cap. 7. Sect. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is cock-ſure of his inſtruments</hi>; yet within a few lines he changeth his note, and ſaith, <hi>Though he have good hope of them, yet he is not certain of their continuance, becauſe ſome by the mercy of God have been reclaimed and freed from his Covenant.</hi> Beſides, he confeſſeth, <hi>the Devil ſuffereth ſome to live long undiſcloſed, that they may exerciſe the greater meaſure of his malice in the world.</hi> It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:93433:189"/>
that if the two true proofs of Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> which are the Witches Confeſſion, or ſufficient witneſſes, fail, <hi>we have not warrant,</hi> as he ſaith, <hi>in the word, to put ſuch an one to Death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I conclude this point in the words of Mr. <hi>Perkins; I adviſe all Jurors, that as they be diligent in the zeal of Gods glory, ſo they would be careful what they do, and not to condemn any party ſuſpected upon bare preſumptions, without ſound and ſufficient proofs, that they be not guilty through their own raſhneſs, of ſhedding inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood.</hi>

                     <p>IN <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. The Witch is named with divers other ſorts of ſuch as uſed the like unlawful Arts; as the Diviner, the Obſerver of times, an Inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a Charmer, a Conſulter with a Familiar Spirit, a Wiſard, or a Necromancer. The Text addeth, <hi>All that do theſe things are an abomination to the Lord, and becauſe of theſe abominations, the Lord thy God doth drive them</hi> [the Nations] <hi>out from before thee.</hi> If we deſire to know what thoſe abominations of the Nations were, we are told in general in the 14. Verſe of the ſame Chapter: <hi>Theſe Nations hearkened unto obſervers of times, and unto Diviners.</hi> There is no other crime in this Chapter laid to the charge of all, or any of theſe practiſers of ſuch unlawful Arts, but of <hi>lying Prophecies</hi>; and therefore the Text ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>The Lord thy God will raiſe up unto thee a Prophet from the midſt of thee, of thy Brethren, like unto me, unto him ſhall ye hearken, and not to the Diviners, Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſards, Charmers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Setting aſide the caſe of <hi>Job</hi> (wherein God gave a ſpecial and Extraordinary Commiſſion) I do not find in Scripture that the Devil, or Witch, or any other, had power ordinarily permitted them, either to kill or hurt any man, or to meddle with the Goods of any: for though, for the trial of the hearts of men, God doth permit the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Ordinarily to tempt them; yet he hath no
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:93433:190"/>
Commiſſion to deſtroy the Lives or Goods of men; it is little leſs than blaſphemy to ſay any ſuch thing of the admirable providence of God, whereby he preſerves all his Creatures.</p>
                     <p>It was crime ſufficient for all thoſe practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of unlawful Arts, to delude the People with falſe and lying Prophecies, thereby to make them forget to depend upon God, and <hi>to have their Souls turn after ſuch as have Familiar Spirits, and after Wiſards, to go a whoring after them,</hi> as the Lord ſaith, <hi>Levit.</hi> 20.6. This ſpiritual whoredom is flat Idolatry, in the common phraſe of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and thoſe that be enticers to it, thereby endeavour to deſtroy the Souls of the People, and are by many degrees more worthy of Death, than thoſe that only deſtroy the Bodies or Goods of men.</p>
                     <p>If there were a Law that every one ſhould be put to Death, or puniſhed, that ſhould adviſedly endeavour to perſwade men that they are skilful in thoſe forbidden Arts, or in foretelling of things to come, or that they have contracted with the Devil, and can thereby murther or deſtroy mens Goods; I ſhould never deny ſuch a Law to be moſt conſonant and agreeing with the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But becauſe I may be thought by ſome a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of theſe forbidden Arts, through want of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the Scripture about the quality of them; I have made choice of a man who is no Friend to Witches, and whoſe Learning in this
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:93433:190"/>

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>An obſerver of times,</hi> or Soothſayer, an Obſerver of the Clouds, a Planetary, or an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of the flying of Fowls, an Augur. As the Diviners were carried much by inward and Spiritual Motions, ſo theſe by outward Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Creatures. The Hebrews ſay, they were ſuch as did ſet times, for the doing of things, ſaying, Such a day is good, and ſuch a day is naught.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>An Obſerver of Fortunes,</hi> one that curiouſly ſearcheth ſigns of good or evil luck, which are Learned by Experience: the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is, to find out by Experience; Whereupon the word here uſed is one that too curiouſly obſerveth, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſeth things that do fall out, as lucky or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:93433:191"/>
The Hebrews deſcribe it thus, as if one ſhould ſay, Becauſe the morſel of Bread is fallen out of my mouth, or my Staff out of my hand, I will not go to ſuch a place: becauſe a Fox paſſed by on my right hand, I will not go out of my Houſe this day. Our new Tranſlation renders this word an Inchanter.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>A Witch,</hi> a Sorcerer, ſuch as bewitch the Senſes or minds of Men, by changing the forms of things to another hew. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word for a Witch properly ſignifies a Jugler, and is derived from a word which ſignifies <hi>changing or turning</hi>; and <hi>Moſes</hi> teacheth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7. that Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es wrought by Enchantments, that is, <hi>by ſecret Sleights, Juglings, Cloſe conveyance, or of Gliſtering like the flame of Fire, or a Sword, wherewith Mens Eyes were dazled.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>A Charmer,</hi> or one that conjureth conjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; the <hi>Hebrew</hi> ſignifies <hi>conjoyning or conſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>—The Charmer is ſaid to be he, that ſpeaketh words of a ſtrange Language, and without ſenſe; that if one ſay ſo or ſo unto a Serpent, it cannot hurt him; he that whiſpereth over a wound, or that readeth over an Infant that it may not be frighted, or layeth the Bible upon a Child that it may ſleep.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>A Wiſard</hi> or cunning Man, in Hebrew named of his knowledge or cunning—The <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> deſcribe him thus, That he put in his mouth a bone of a Bird, and burned incenſe, and did other things until he fell down with ſhame, and
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:93433:191"/>
ſpake with his mouth things that were to come to paſs.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>A Necromancer,</hi> one that ſeeketh unto the Dead: of him they ſay, he made himſelf hungry, and went and lodged among the Graves, that the dead might come unto him in a Dream, and make known unto him that which he asked of him; and others there were that clad themſelves with Cloaths for that purpoſe, and ſpake certain words, and burned Incenſe, and ſlept by themſelves; that ſuch a dead perſon might come and talk with them in a Dream.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Laſtly, <hi>The Conſulter with Familiar Spirits,</hi> in Hebrew, a <hi>Conſulter with Ob,</hi> applied here to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, who poſſeſſed with an evil Spirit, ſpake with a hollow voice as out of a bottle.—The <hi>Hebrews</hi> explain it thus, That he which had a Familiar Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſtood and burned Incenſe, and held a rod of Mirtle-tree in his hand, and waved it, and ſpake certain words in ſecret, until he that enquired did hear one ſpeak unto him, and anſwer him touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he enquired, with words from under the Earth, with a very low voice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Likewiſe, one took a dead mans Skull and burnt Incenſe thereto, and inchanted thereby till he heard a very low voice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Text in our Engliſh Tranſlation being expounded a Familiar Spirit, and ſeconded by the Hiſtory of the Woman of <hi>Endor,</hi> may ſeem a ſtrong evidence that the Devil covenanted with Witches: but if all be granted that can be deſired, that this Familiar Spirit ſignifies a Devil, yet it comes not home to prove the main point; for it is no proof
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:93433:192"/>
that the Familiar Spirit enter'd upon Covenant, or had or could give power to others to kill the perſons, or deſtroy the Goods of others. King <hi>James</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>the Devil can make ſome to be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, and ſo become very Daemoniaques; and that ſhe who had the Spirit of</hi> Python <hi>in</hi> Acts 16. <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhe conqueſted ſuch gain to her Master; that Spirit was not of her own raiſing or commanding, as ſhe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to appoint, but ſpake by her Tongue as well privately as publickly.</hi> We do not find the <hi>Pythoneſſe</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned or reproved, but the unclean Spirit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt to come out of her. The Child which was</hi> too young to make a Covenant with the Devil, was <hi>poſſeſſed with a dumb and deaf Spirit, and the Devil charged to come out, and enter no more into him,</hi> Mark 9. <hi>A Daughter of Abraham</hi> (that is, of the Faith of <hi>Abraham) was troubled with a Spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and bowed together that ſhe could not lift her ſelf up,</hi> Luke 13.10, 16.</p>
                     <p>It is obſervable, that in <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. where all the unlawful Arts are reckoned up, and moſt fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, the crime of them is charged upon the practiſers of thoſe Arts; but the crime of having a Familiar Spirit is not there condemned, but the conſulter of a Familiar Spirit; ſo in <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.31. the prohibition is, <hi>Regard not them that have Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Spirits</hi>; and ſo in <hi>Levit.</hi> 20.6. <hi>The Soul that turneth after ſuch as have Familiar Spirits</hi>; ſo that it was not the having, but the conſulting, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
                     <p>If we draw nearer to the words of the Text, it
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:93433:192"/>
will be found, that theſe words, <hi>a conſulter with a Familiar Spirit,</hi> are no other than a <hi>Conſulter with Ob</hi>; where the queſtion will be what <hi>Ob</hi> ſignifieth. Expoſitors agree, that originally <hi>Ob</hi> ſignifieth a Bottle, and they ſay is applyed here to one poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with an evil Spirit, and ſpeaketh with a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low voice as out of a Bottle: but for this I find no proof they bring out of Scripture, that ſaith, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth that <hi>Ob</hi> ſignifieth one poſſeſſed with a Familiar Spirit in the Belly; the only proof is, that the Greek Interpreters of the Bible Tranſlate it <hi>Engaſtromuthi,</hi> which is, ſpeaking in the Belly; and the word anciently, and long before the time of the Septuagint Tranſlators, was properly uſed for one that had the cunning or ſlight to ſhut his mouth, and ſeem to ſpeak with his Belly; which that it can be done without the help of a Familiar Spirit, Experience of this Age ſheweth in an Iriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. We do not find it ſaid, that the Woman of <hi>Endor</hi> did foretel any thing to <hi>Saul,</hi> by the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low voice of a Familiar Spirit in her Belly; neither did <hi>Saul</hi> require, nor the Woman promiſe ſo to anſwer him; but he required, <hi>Bring me him up whom I ſhall name unto thee, and ſhe undertook to do it</hi>; which argues a deſire in <hi>Saul</hi> to conſult with the dead, which is called <hi>Necromancy,</hi> or <hi>conſulting with the Dead.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it hath been ſaid, ſhe raiſed the Devil in <hi>Samuel</hi>'s likeneſs, yet there is no ſuch thing ſaid in the Text; when the Woman went about her work, the firſt thing noted is, that <hi>when ſhe ſaw</hi> Samuel, <hi>ſhe cryed out with a loud voice:</hi> An Argument ſhe was frighted with ſeeing ſomething ſhe did not expect
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:93433:193"/>
to ſee: it is not ſaid, that when ſhe knew <hi>Saul,</hi> but when ſhe ſaw <hi>Samuel, ſhe cried out with a loud voice</hi>; when ſhe knew <hi>Saul,</hi> ſhe had no reaſon to be afraid, but rather comforted, for that ſhe had his Oath for her ſecurity.</p>
                     <p>It may well be, that if either ſhe had a Familiar Spirit, or the Art of hollow ſpeaking, her inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was to deceive <hi>Saul,</hi> and by her ſecret voice to have made him believe, that <hi>Samuel</hi> in another room had anſwered him; for it appears that <hi>Saul</hi> was not in the place where ſhe made a ſhew of raiſing <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel:</hi> for when ſhe cried out with a loud voice, <hi>Saul</hi> comforted her, and bid her not be afraid, and asked her <hi>what ſhe ſaw? and what form is he of?</hi> which queſtions need not have been, if <hi>Saul</hi> had been in the Chamber with the Witch. King <hi>James</hi> confeſſeth, that <hi>Saul was in another Chamber at the conjuration</hi>; and it is likely the Woman had told <hi>Saul</hi> ſhe had ſeen ſome fearful ſight, which made him ask her what ſhe ſaw? and her anſwer was, <hi>ſhe ſaw gods aſcending out of the Earth</hi>; and it may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that Angels waited upon <hi>Samuel,</hi> who was raiſed by God, and not any Puppets or Devils that ſhe conjured up; otherwiſe, the words may be Tranſlated as <hi>Deodat</hi> in the Margent of his <hi>Italian</hi> Bible hath it, <hi>She ſaw a Man of Majeſty or Divine Authority aſcend, un' huomo di Majeſta è d' Authorita Divina,</hi> which well anſwers the queſtion, of what form is he of? which is in the ſingular, not in the plural number.</p>
                     <p>We find it ſaid in <hi>Eſay</hi> 29.4. <hi>Thou ſhalt be brought down, and ſhalt speak out of the ground,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:93433:193"/>
and thy speech ſhall be low out of the dust, and thy voice ſhall be as one that hath a Familiar Spirit out of the ground, and thy ſpeech ſhall whiſper out of the Earth</hi>; which argues, the voice of <hi>Ob</hi> was out of the Earth, rather than out of the Belly; and ſo the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Expoſition, which I cited before, affirms. Some Learned have been of Opinion, That a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reaſon may be given, why in ſome places cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Exhalations out of the Earth may give to ſome a prophetical Spirit. Add hereunto, That ſome of the Heathen Oracles were ſaid to ſpeak out of the Earth: and among thoſe five ſorts of <hi>Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy,</hi> mentioned by Doctor <hi>Reynolds,</hi> in his 76. Lecture of his cenſure of the <hi>Apocryphals,</hi> not any of them is ſaid to have any Spirit in their Belly. The Romaniſts, who are all great affirmers of the Power of Witches, agree, That the Soul of <hi>Samuel</hi> was ſent by God to the Woman of <hi>Endor:</hi> to this not only <hi>Delrio,</hi> but <hi>Bellarmine</hi> before him agrees. That true <hi>Samuel</hi> did appear as ſent by God, as he ſent <hi>Elias</hi> to <hi>Ochoſias King of Iſrael, who being ſick ſent to conſult with Beelzebub the God of Echron,</hi> may appear, for that <hi>Samuel</hi> is ſo true and certain in his Prediction to <hi>Saul</hi>; which no Witch, no Devil could ever have told: for though the Wiſdom and Experience of the Devil do enable him to conjecture probably of many Events, yet poſitively to ſay, <hi>To morrow thou and thy Sons ſhall dye,</hi> is more than naturally the Devil could know.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> confeſſeth the Devil could not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel the exact time of <hi>Saul</hi>'s death; and therefore he anſwers, That God revealed to the Devil as
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:93433:194"/>
his Inſtrument <hi>Saul</hi>'s overthrow, by which means, and no other, the Devil was enabled to foretel the death of <hi>Saul.</hi> Here Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> proves not that Satan was appointed by God to work <hi>Saul</hi>'s over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, or that it was made known to him when it ſhould be done.</p>
                     <p>As the reſt of the Speech of <hi>Samuel</hi> is true, ſo theſe words of his, <hi>Why haſt thou diſquieted me to bring me up?</hi> may be alſo true; which cannot be, if it be ſpoken by the Devil; or why ſhould the Devil tell truths in all other things elſe, and lye only in this, I know no reaſon. Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> preſſeth theſe words againſt the appearing of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> thus: <hi>If Samuel had ſaid them, he had lied; but Samuel could not lie, for Samuel could not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted, nor raiſed by Saul.</hi> It is true, God only raiſed <hi>Samuel effectually,</hi> but <hi>occaſionally Saul</hi> might raiſe him. But, ſaith Doctor <hi>Reynolds, Though</hi> Saul <hi>was the occaſion, yet</hi> Samuel <hi>could not truly ſay that</hi> Saul <hi>had diſquieted him; for bleſſed are they that dye in the Lord, ſaith the Spirit, becauſe they reſt from their labours; and</hi> Samuel <hi>was no more to be diſquieted (if he were ſent by God) than</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Elias <hi>were when they appeared to ſhew the Glory of Chriſt,</hi> Mat. 17. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It did not diſpleaſe <hi>Samuel</hi> to be employed in the Office of an Angel, but he obeyed God glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; yet ſince the occaſion of his appearing diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God, it might for that cauſe diſpleaſe alſo <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel.</hi> Beſides, we need not underſtand the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting of <hi>Samuel</hi>'s mind, but of his body, by not ſuffering it to reſt in peace after death, according to the common and uſual condition of Mankind: this ſenſe the Original will well bear. Again, it
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:93433:194"/>
cannot be believed that the Devil would ever have preached ſo Divine and excellent a Sermon to <hi>Saul,</hi> which was able to have converted, and brought him to Repentance; this was not the way for the Devil to bring either <hi>Saul</hi> or the Woman to renounce God. Laſtly, the Text doth not ſay that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man raiſed <hi>Samuel</hi>; yet it calls him <hi>Samuel,</hi> and ſaith that <hi>Saul perceived or underſtood that it was Samuel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> and many others eſteem <hi>Balaam</hi> to have been a Witch or Conjurer, but I find no ſuch thing in the Text; when he was required to curſe the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> his anſwer was, <hi>I will bring you word as the Lord ſhall speak unto me,</hi> Numb. 22.8. and God came unto <hi>Balaam</hi> in <hi>v.</hi> 9. and in <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>Balaam</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Lord refuſeth to give me leave</hi>; and when <hi>Balak</hi> ſent a ſecond time, his anſwer was, <hi>If Balak would give me his houſe full of ſilver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God, to do leſs or more.</hi> In <hi>v.</hi> 20. God cometh to <hi>Balaam,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>If the men come to call thee, go; but yet the words which I ſhall ſay unto thee, that ſhalt thou do.</hi> And when <hi>Balaam</hi> came before <hi>Balak,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 38. <hi>Lo I am come unto thee, have I now any power at all to ſay any thing? The word which God putteth into my mouth, that ſhall I ſpeak:</hi> and in the 23. Chap. v. 18. <hi>Balaam</hi> ſaith, <hi>How ſhall I curſe whom God hath not curſed?</hi> And in <hi>v.</hi> 12. he ſaith, <hi>Muſt I not take heed to ſpeak that which the Lord hath put into my mouth?</hi> Theſe places laid together, prove <hi>Balaam</hi> to have been a true Prophet of the Lord; and he propheſied no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contrary to the Lords command, therefore St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls him a Prophet.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="344" facs="tcp:93433:195"/>Nevertheleſs it is true, that <hi>Balaam</hi> ſinned no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly, though not by being a Witch or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer, or a falſe Prophet; his faults were, that when God had told him he ſhould not go to <hi>Balak,</hi> yet in his covetous heart he deſired to go, being tempted with the rewards of Divination, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of promotion; ſo that upon a ſecond Meſſage from <hi>Balak</hi> he ſtayed the Meſſengers, to ſee if God would ſuffer him to go; wherefore the Lord in his anger ſent <hi>Balaam.</hi> Alſo when God had told <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> that he would bleſs <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet <hi>Balaam</hi> did ſtrive to tempt God, and by ſeveral Altars and Sacrifices to change the mind of God. Again, when <hi>Balaam</hi> ſaw God immutable in bleſſing <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he taught <hi>Balak to lay a stumbling-block before the Sons of Iſrael, to eat things ſacrificed to Idols, and to commit Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Rev.</hi> 2.14. Whereas it is ſaid, That <hi>Balaam went not up as at other times to ſeek for Enchantments, Numb.</hi> 24.2. the Original is, <hi>to meet Divinations,</hi> that is, he did not go ſeek the Lord by Sacrifices, as he did <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.3, 15.</p>
                     <p>An exact difference between all thoſe Arts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in <hi>Deut.</hi> no man I think can give; that in ſome they did agree, and in others differed, ſeems probable. That they were all lying and falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, though in ſeveral ways, I think none can deny. That they differed in their degrees of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments is poſſible: there are but three ſorts that can be proved were to be put to death, <hi>viz.</hi> the Witch, the Familiar Spirit, the Wiſard. As for the Witch, there hath been ſome doubt made of it. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors that were skill'd in the Laws
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:93433:195"/>
of <hi>Moſes,</hi> obſerve, that whereſoever one was to dye by their Law, the Law always did run in an <hi>affirmative Precept</hi>; as, the man ſhall be ſtoned, ſhall dye, ſhall be put to death, or the like; but in this Text, and no where elſe in Scripture, the ſentence is only a <hi>Prohibition negative, Thou ſhalt not ſuffer a Witch to live,</hi> and not, Thou ſhalt put her to death, or ſtone her, or the like. Hence ſome have been of opinion, that not to ſuffer a Witch to live, was meant not to relieve or maintain her by running after her, and rewarding her. The <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſeem to have two ſorts of Witches, ſome that did hurt, others that did hold the eyes, that is, by jugling and ſlights deceived mens ſenſes. The firſt, they ſay, was to be ſtoned; the other, which according to the proper notation of the word was the true Witch, was only to be beaten.</p>
                     <p>The Septuagint have tranſlated a Witch an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary, a Druggiſter, one that compounds poiſons; and ſo the Latin word for a Witch is <hi>Venefica,</hi> a maker of poiſons: if any ſuch there ever were, or be, that by the help of the Devil do poiſon, ſuch a one is to be put to death, though there be no Covenant with the Devil, becauſe ſhe is an Actor and Principal her ſelf, not by any wonder wrought by the Devil, but by the natural or occult property of the Poyſon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For the time of Christ,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Perkins, though there be no particular mention made of any ſuch Witch, yet thence it followeth not that there were none, for all things that then happened are not recorded; and I would fain know of the chief Patrons of them, whether thoſe
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:93433:196"/>
perſons poſſeſſed with the Devil, and troubled with ſtrange Diſeaſes, whom Chriſt healed, were not bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſome ſuch people as our Witches are? If they ſay no, let them if they can prove the contrary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here it may be thought that Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> puts his Adverſaries to a great pinch; but it doth not prove ſo: for the Queſtion being only whether thoſe that were poſſeſſed in our Saviour's Time were bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: The Oppoſers of Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſay they were not bewitched; but if he or any other ſay they were, the Proof will reſt wholly on him or them to make good their <hi>Affirmative</hi>; it cannot in reaſon be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that his Adverſaries ſhould prove the <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>; it is againſt the Rules of Diſputation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it.</p>

So affable was his Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his Diſcourſe ſo ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, his Judgment ſo exact in moſt parts of Learning; and his Affections to the Church ſo exemplary in him, that I never enjoyed a greater Felicity in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of any Man living, than I did in his: In which Reſpects I may affirm both with Safety and Modeſty, that we did not only take <hi>ſweet Counſel together; but walked in the Houſe of God as Friends:</hi> I muſt needs ſay,

I was prepared for that great Blow, by the Loſs of my Preferment in the Church of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> which gave me the Opportunity of ſo dear and beloved a Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; ſo that I loſt him partly before he died, which made the Miſery the more ſupportable, when I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of him for altogether. But I was never more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Infelicity, than I am at this preſent, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to that Satisfaction, which I am ſure he could have given the Gentleman whom I am to deal with:

                           <hi>(1)</hi> THE Tenent of the Natural Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Mankind, New, Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and Dangerous. <hi>(2)</hi> The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion ſtated out of <hi>Bellarmine</hi>: Some Contradictions of his noted. <hi>(3)</hi> Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine's Argument anſwered out of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> himſelf. <hi>(4)</hi> The Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> before the Flood. <hi>(5)</hi> The diſperſion of Nations over the World after the Confuſion of <hi>Babel,</hi> was by entire Families, over which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were Kings. <hi>(6)</hi> and from them all Kings deſcended. <hi>(7)</hi> All Kings are either Fathers of their People, <hi>(8)</hi> Or Heirs of ſuch Fathers, or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers of the Right of ſuch Fathers. <hi>(9)</hi> Of the Eſcheating of Kingdoms. <hi>(10)</hi> Of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal

and Paternal Power, and their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>SInce the time that School-Divinity began to flouriſh, there hath been a common Opinion maintained, as well by Divines, as by divers other learned Men, which affirms,
<q>Mankind is naturally endowed and born with Freedom from all Subjection, and at liberty to choſe what Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it pleaſe: And that the Power which any one Man hath over others, was at firſt beſtowed according to the diſcretion of the Multitude.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Tenent was firſt hatched in the Schools, and hath been foſtered by all ſucceeding Papiſts for good Divinity. The Divines alſo of the Reformed Churches have entertained it, and the Common People every where tenderly embrace it, as being moſt plauſible to Fleſh and blood, for that it prodigally deſtributes a Portion of Liberty to the meaneſt of the Multitude, who magnifie Liberty, as if the height of Humane Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity were only to be found in it, never
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93433:204"/>
remembring That the deſire of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was the firſt Cauſe of the Fall of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But howſoever this Vulgar Opinion hath of late obtained a great Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet it is not to be found in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers and Doctors of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church: It contradicts the Doctrine and Hiſtory of the Holy Scriptures, the conſtant Practice of all Ancient Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, and the very Principles of the Law of Nature. It is hard to ſay whether it be more erroneous in Divinity, or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous in Policy.</p>
                     <p>Yet upon the ground of this Doctrine both <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> and ſome other zealous favourers of the <hi>Geneva</hi> Diſcipline, have built a perillous Concluſion, which is, <hi>That the People or Multitude have Power to puniſh, or deprive the Prince, if he tranſgreſs the Laws of the Kingdom</hi>; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>Parſons</hi> and <hi>Buchanan:</hi> the firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>Dolman,</hi> in the Third Chapter of his Firſt Book labours to prove, that Kings have been lawfully chaſtiſed by their Commonwealths: The latter in his Book <hi>De jure Regni apud
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93433:205"/>
Scotos,</hi> maintains A Liberty of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to depoſe their Prince. Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> both look aſquint this way.</p>
                     <p>This deſperate Aſſertion whereby Kings are made ſubject to the <hi>Cenſures</hi> and <hi>Deprivations of their Subjects,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows (as the Authors of it conceive) as a neceſſary Conſequence of that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Poſition of the ſuppoſed <hi>Natural Equality and Freedom of Mankind, and Liberty to chooſe what form of Government it pleaſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And though Sir <hi>John Heywood, Adam Blackwood, John Barclay,</hi> and ſome others have Learnedly Confuted both <hi>Bucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi> and <hi>Parſons,</hi> and bravely vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Right of Kings in moſt Points, yet all of them, when they come to the Argument drawn from the <hi>Natural Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Equality of Mankind,</hi> do with one conſent admit it for a Truth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable, not ſo much as once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying or oppoſing it; whereas if they did but Confute this firſt erroneous Principle, the whole Fabrick of this vaſt Engine of <hi>Popular Sedition</hi> would drop down of it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:93433:205"/>The Rebellious Conſequence which follows this prime Article of the <hi>Natural Freedom of Mankind</hi> may be my Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Warrant for a modeſt Examination of the original Truth of it; much hath been ſaid, and by many, for the <hi>Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>; Equity requires that an Ear be reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a little for the <hi>Negative.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this DISCOURSE I ſhall give my ſelf theſe Cautions:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, I have nothing to do to meddle with Myſteries of State, ſuch <hi>Arcana Imperii,</hi> or Cabinet Counſels, the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar may not pry into. An implicite Faith is given to the meaneſt Artificer in his own Craft, how much more is it then due to a Prince in the profound Secrets of Government, the Cauſes and Ends of the greateſt politique Actions and Motions of State dazle the Eyes, and exceed the Capacities of all men, ſave only thoſe that are hourly verſed in the managing Publique Affairs: yet ſince the Rule for each men to know in what to obey his Prince, cannot be learnt without a relative Knowledge of thoſe Points wherein a Sovereign may
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93433:206"/>
Command, it is neceſſary when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and Pleaſures of Superiors come abroad and call for an Obedience, that every man himſelf know how to regulate his Actions or his ſufferings; for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Quality of the Thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, an Active or Paſſive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is to be yielded; and this is not to limit the Princes Power; but the extent of the Subjects Obedience, by giving to <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things that are <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar's,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I am not to queſtion, or quarrel at the Rights or Liberties of this or any other Nation, my task is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to enquire from whom theſe firſt came, not to diſpute what, or how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny theſe are; but whether they were derived from the Laws of <hi>Natural Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> or from the <hi>Grace and bounty of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> My deſire and Hope is, that the people of <hi>England</hi> may and do enjoy as ample Priviledges as any Nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven; the greateſt Liberty in the World (if it be duly conſidered) is for a people to live under a <hi>Monarch.</hi> It is the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of this Kingdom, all other ſhews or pretexts of Liberty, are
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93433:206"/>
but ſeveral degrees of <hi>Slavery,</hi> and a <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> only to deſtroy <hi>Liberty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If ſuch as Maintain the Natural Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Mankind, take Offence at the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I take to Examine it, they muſt take heed that they do not deny by Retail, that Liberty which they affirm by Whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale: For, if the <hi>Theſis</hi> be true, the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis</hi> will follow, that all men may Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine their own Charters, Deeds, or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences by which they claim and hold the Inheritance or Free-hold of their <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I muſt not detract from the Worth of all thoſe Learned Men, who are of a contrary Opinion in the Point of <hi>Natural Liberty</hi>: The profoundeſt Scholar that ever was known hath not been able to ſearch out every Truth that is diſcoverable; neither <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in Philoſophy, nor <hi>Hooker</hi> in Divinity. They are but men, yet I reverence their Judgments in moſt Points, and confeſs my ſelf beholding to their Errors too in this; ſomething that I found amiſs in their Opinions, guided me in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of that Truth which (I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93433:207"/>
my ſelf) they miſſed. A Dwarf ſometimes may ſee that which a Giant looks over; for whileſt one Truth is curiouſly ſearched after, another muſt neceſſarily be neglected. Late Writers have taken up too much upon Truſt from the ſubtile School-Men, who to be ſure to thruſt down the King below the Pope, thought it the ſafeſt courſe to advance the People above the King, that ſo the Papal Power might take place of the Regal. Thus many an Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Subject hath been fooled into this Faith, that a man may become a <hi>Martyr</hi> for his <hi>Countrey,</hi> by being a <hi>Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> to his <hi>Prince</hi>; whereas the New-coyned diſtinction of Subjects into Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alliſts and Patriots, is moſt unnatural, ſince the relation between King and People is ſo great, that their well-being is ſo Reciprocal.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2) To make evident the Grounds of this Queſtion, about the <hi>Natural Liberty of Mankind,</hi> I will lay down ſome paſſages of Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that may beſt unfold the State of this Controverſie. <hi>Secular or Civil Power</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is inſtituted by Men; It is in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93433:207"/>
the People, unleſs they beſtow it on a Prince. This Power is immediately in the whole Multitude, as in the Subject of it; for this Power is in the Divine Law, but the Divine Law hath given this Power to no particular Man— If the Poſitive Law be taken away, there is left no Reaſon, why amongſt a Multitude (who are Equal) one rather than another ſhould bear Rule over the reſt?— Power is given by the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to one man, or to more by the ſame Law of Nature; for the Commonwealth cannot exerciſe this Power, therefore it is bound to beſtow it upon ſome One Man, or ſome Few— It depends upon the Conſent of the Multitude to ordain over themſelves a King, or Conſul, or other Magiſtrates; and if there be a lawful Cauſe, the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude may change the Kingdom into an</hi> Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocracy <hi>or</hi> Democracy. Thus far <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>; in which paſſages are compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſtrength of all that ever I have read, or heard produced for the <hi>Natural Liberty of the Subject.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Before I examine or refute theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, I muſt a little make ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations upon his Words.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:93433:208"/>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> He ſaith, that by the law of God, <hi>Power</hi> is immediately in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; hereby he makes God to be the immediate Author of a <hi>Democratical Eſtate</hi>; for a <hi>Democraſy</hi> is nothing elſe but the Power of the Multitude. If this be true, not only <hi>Ariſtocracies,</hi> but all <hi>Monarchies</hi> are altogether unlawful, as being ordained (as he thinks) by Men, whenas God himſelf hath choſen a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> He holds, that although a <hi>Democracy</hi> be the Ordinance of God, yet the people have no power to uſe the Power which God hath given them, but only power to give away their Power; whereby it followeth, that there can be no <hi>Democratical Government,</hi> becauſe he ſaith, the people muſt give their Power to One Man, or to ſome Few; which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth either a <hi>Regal</hi> or <hi>Ariſtocratical Eſtate</hi>; which the Multitude is tyed to do, even by the ſame Law of <hi>Nature</hi> which Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally gave them the <hi>Power</hi>: And why then doth he ſay, the <hi>Multitude</hi> may change the <hi>Kingdom</hi> into a <hi>Democracy</hi>?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="11" facs="tcp:93433:208"/>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He concludes, that if there be a lawful Cauſe, the <hi>Multitude</hi> may change the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> Here I would fain know who ſhall judg of this lawful Cauſe? If the <hi>Multitude</hi> (for I ſee no Body elſe can) then this is a peſtilent and dangerous Concluſion.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3) I come now to examine that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument which is uſed by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and is the One and only <hi>Argument</hi> I can find produced by my Author for the proof of the <hi>Natural Liberty of the People.</hi> It is thus framed: <hi>That God hath given or ordained Power, is evident by Scripture; But God hath given it to no particular Perſon, becauſe by nature all Men are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual; therefore he hath given Power to the People or Multitude.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To Anſwer this Reaſon, drawn from the Equality of Mankind by Nature, I will firſt uſe the help of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whoſe very words are theſe: <hi>If many men had been together created out of the Earth, they all ought to have been Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces over their Poſterity.</hi> In theſe words we have an Evident Confeſſion, that Creation made man Prince of his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93433:209"/>
And indeed not only <hi>Adam,</hi> but the ſucceding <hi>Patriarchs</hi> had, by Right of Father-hood, Royal Authority over their Children. Nor dares <hi>Bellarmine</hi> deny this alſo. That the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> (ſaith he) were endowed with Kingly Power, their Deeds do teſtify; for as <hi>Adam</hi> was Lord of his Children, ſo his Children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, had a Command and Power over their own Children; but ſtill with ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to the Firſt Parent, who is Lord-Paramout over his Childrens Children to all Generations, as being the <hi>Grand-Father</hi> of his People.</p>
                     <p n="4">(4) I ſee not then how the Children of <hi>Adam,</hi> or of any man elſe can be free from ſubjection to their <hi>Parents:</hi> And this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of Children being the Fountain of all <hi>Regal Authority,</hi> by the Ordination of God himſelf; It follows, that Civil Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, not only in general is by Divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but even the Aſſignment of it Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fically to the eldeſt Parents, which quite takes away that New and Common diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which refers only Power Univerſal and Abſolute to God; but Power Reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive in regard of the Special Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to the Choice of the people.</p>

them by their Father; for of them was the whole World over-ſpread, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Benediction given to him and his Sons, <hi>Be fruitful and multiply, and repleniſh the Earth.</hi> Moſt of the Civileſt Nations of the Earth labour to fetch their Original from ſome One of the Sons or Nephews of <hi>Noah,</hi> which were ſcatterd abroad after the Confuſion of <hi>Babel:</hi> In this Diſperſion we muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly find the Eſtabliſhment of <hi>Regal Power</hi> throughout the Kingdoms of the World.</p>
                     <p>It is a common Opinion, that at the Confuſion of Tongues there were 72 diſtinct Nations erected, all which were not Confuſed Multitudes, without Heads or Governors, and at Liberty to choſe what Governors or Government they pleaſed; but they were diſtinct Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, which had Fathers for Rulers over them; whereby it appears that even in the Confuſion God was careful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Fatherly Authority, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributing the diverſity of Languages ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diverſity of Families; for ſo plainly it appears by the Text: Firſt, after the Enumeration of the Sons
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93433:210"/>
of <hi>Japhet,</hi> the Concluſion is, <hi>By theſe were the Iſles of the Gentiles divided in their Lands, every one after his Tongue, after their Families, in their Nations</hi>; ſo it is ſaid: <hi>Theſe are the Sons of</hi> Ham <hi>after their Families, after their Tongues, in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, and in their Nations.</hi> The like we read, <hi>Theſe are the Sons of</hi> Shem <hi>after their Families, after their Tongues, in their Lands, after their Nations.

                     </p>
                     <p>In this Diviſion of the World, ſome are of Opinion that <hi>Noah</hi> uſed Lots for the diſtribution of it; others affirm he ſayled about the <hi>Mediterranean Sea</hi> in Ten years, and as he went about, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to each Son his part, and ſo made the Diviſion of the then known World into <hi>Aſia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> (according to the number of his Sons) the Limits of which Three Parts are all found in that Midland Sea.</p>
                     <p n="6">(6) But howſoever the manner of this Diviſion be uncertain, yet it is moſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93433:211"/>
certain the Diviſion it ſelf was by Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies from <hi>Noah</hi> and his Children, over which the Parents were Heads and Princes.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt theſe was <hi>Nimrod,</hi> who no doubt (as Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> affirms) was by good Right, Lord or King over his Family; yet againſt Right did he enlarge his Empire, by ſeizing violently on the Rights of other Lords of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: And in this ſenſe he may be ſaid to be the Author and firſt Founder of <hi>Monarchy.</hi> And all thoſe that do attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute unto him the Original Regal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, do hold he got it by Tyrany or Uſurpation, and not by any due Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the People or Multitude, or by any Faction with them.</p>
                     <p>As this <hi>Patriarchal Power</hi> continued in <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> even until the <hi>Egyptian Bondage</hi>; ſo we find it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Sons of <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau.</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>Theſe are the Sons of</hi> Iſmael, <hi>and theſe are their Names by their Caſtles and Towns, Twelve Princes of their Tribes and Families.

their Families and their Places by their Nations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">(7) Some perhaps may think that theſe Princes and Dukes of Families were but ſome petty Lords under ſome greater Kings, becauſe the number of them are ſo many, that their particular Territories could be but ſmall, and not worthy the Title of Kingdoms; but they muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that at firſt, Kings had no ſuch large Dominions as they have now adays; we find in the time of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 300 years after the Flood, that in a little corner of <hi>Aſia,</hi> 9 Kings at once met in Battail, moſt of which were but Kings of Cities apiece, with the adjacent Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, as of <hi>Sodom, Gomorrha, Shinar, &amp;c.</hi> In the ſame Chapter is mention of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedeck</hi> King of <hi>Salem,</hi> which was but the City of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And in the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of the Kings of <hi>Edom,</hi> the Names of each King's City is recorded, as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mark to diſtinguiſh their Dominions. In the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was but a ſmall circuit, <hi>Joſhua</hi> deſtroyed thirty one Kings; and about the ſame time,<note place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 20.16.</note> 
                        <hi>Adoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeck</hi> had 70 Kings whoſe hands and toes he had cut off, and made them feed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Table. A few years after this, 32
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93433:212"/>
Kings came to <hi>Benhadad</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi> and about 70 Kings of <hi>Greece</hi> went to the Wars of <hi>Troy. Caeſar</hi> found more Kings in <hi>France,</hi> than there be now Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces there, and at his ſailing over into this Iſland, he found four Kings in our County of <hi>Kent.</hi> Theſe heaps of Kings in each Nation are an Argument their Territories were but ſmall, and ſtrongly confirms our Aſſertion, that Erection of Kingdoms came at firſt only by Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Families.</p>
                     <p>By manifeſt Footſteps we may trace this Paternal Government unto the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> coming into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where the Exerciſe of Supream Partriarchal Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction was intermitted, becauſe they were in ſubjection to a ſtronger Prince. After the Return of theſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of Bondage, God out of a ſpecial Care of them, choſe <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively to govern as Princes in the place and ſtead of the Supream Fathers: and after them likewiſe for a time, he raiſed up <hi>Judges,</hi> to defend his People in time of Peril. But when God gave the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Kings, he reeſtabliſhed the Antient and Prime Right of Lineal Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to Paternal Government. And
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93433:212"/>
whenſoever he made choice of any ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Perſon to be King, he intended that the Iſſue alſo ſhould have benefit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as being comprehended ſufficiently in the Perſon of the Father, although the Father only was named in the Graunt.</p>
                     <p n="8">(8.) It may ſeem abſurd to maintain, that Kings now are the Fathers of their People, ſince Experience ſhews the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. It is true, all Kings be not the Natural Parents of their Subjects, yet they all either are, or are to be reputed the next Heirs to thoſe firſt Progenitors, who were at firſt the Natural Parents of the whole People, and in their Right ſucceed to the Exerciſe of <hi>Supreme Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction</hi>; and ſuch Heirs are not only Lords of their own Children, but alſo of their Brethren, and all others that were ſubject to their Fathers: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we find, that God told <hi>Cain</hi> of his Brother <hi>Abel, His Deſires ſhall be ſubject unto thee, and thou ſhalt rule over him.</hi> Accordingly, when <hi>Jacob</hi> bought his Brother's Birth-right, <hi>Iſaac</hi> bleſſed him thus, <hi>Be Lord over thy Brethren, and let the Sons of thy Mother bow before thee.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="9">(9.) It may be demanded what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of the Right of <hi>Fatherhood,</hi> in Caſe the Crown does eſcheat for want of an Heir? Whether doth it not then Divolve to the People? The Anſwer is, It is but the Negligence or Ignorance of the People to loſe the Knowledge of the true Heir: For an Heir there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways is. If <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf were ſtill living, and now ready to die, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that there is One Man, and but One in the World who is next Heir,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93433:213"/>
although the Knowledge who ſhould be that One Man be quite loſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This Ignorance of the People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admitted, it doth not by any means follow; that for want of Heirs the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power is devolved to the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and that they have Power to Rule, and Choſe what Rulers they pleaſe. No, the Kingly Power eſcheats in ſuch caſes to the Princes and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Heads of Families: for every Kingdom is reſolved into thoſe parts whereof at firſt it was made. By the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting of great Families or petty King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, we find the greater <hi>Monarchies</hi> were at the firſt erected; and into ſuch again, as into their firſt Matter many times they return again. And becauſe the dependencie of ancient Families is oft obſcure or worn out of Knowledge; therefore the wiſdom of All or Moſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have thought fit to adopt many times thoſe for Heads of Families, and Princes of Provinces, whoſe Merits, Abilities, or Fortunes, have enobled them, or made them fit and capable of ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Favours. All ſuch prime Heads and Fathers have power to conſent in the

uniting or conferring of their Fatherly Right of Sovereign Authority on whom they pleaſe: And he that is ſo Elected, claims not his Power as a <hi>Donative</hi> from the People; but as being ſubſtituted properly by God, from whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives his <hi>Royal Charter</hi> of an <hi>

                     <p>If it pleaſe God, for the Correction of the Prince, or puniſhment of the People, to ſuffer Princes to be removed, and others to be placed in their rooms, either by the Factions of the Nobility, or Rebellion of the People; in all ſuch caſes, the Judgment of God, who hath Power to give and to take away King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, is moſt juſt: Yet the Miniſtry of Men who Execute Gods Judgments without Commiſſion, is ſinful and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.

                     <p>To confirm this Natural Right of <hi>Regal</hi> Power, we find in the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> That the Law which enjoyns Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Kings, is delivered in the terms of <hi>Honour thy Father,</hi> as if all power were originally in the Father. If Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Parents be immediately due by a <hi>Natural Law,</hi> and Subjection to Princes, but by the Mediation of an <hi>Humane Ordinance</hi>; what reaſon is there that the Laws of <hi>Nature</hi> ſhould give place to the Laws of Men? as we ſee the power of the Father over his Child,

                     <p>If we compare the Natural Rights of a Father with thoſe of a King, we find them all one, without any difference at all but only in the Latitude or Extent of them: as the Father over one Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo the King as Father over many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies extends his care to preſerve, feed, cloth, inſtruct and defend the whole Commonwealth. His War, his Peace, his Courts of Juſtice, and all his Acts of Sovereignty tend only to preſerve and diſtribute to every ſubordinate and inferiour Father, and to their Children, their Rights and Privileges; ſo that all the Duties of a King are ſummed up in an Univerſal Fatherly Care of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>

I know for this Poſition <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> quarrels with his Maſter, but moſt unjuſtly; for therein he contradicts his own Principles for they both agree to fetch the Orignial of Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the prime Government.

finding out of this <hi>Lineal Subjection,</hi> deduced from the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Firſt Parents,</hi> according to that Rule of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom, God made all Mankind of One Man, that he might teach the World to be Governed by a King, and not by a Multitude.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Ignorance of the Creation, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned ſeveral Errors amongſt the <hi>Heathen</hi> Philoſophers. <hi>Polybius,</hi> though otherwiſe a moſt profound Philoſopher, and Judicious Hiſtorian, yet here he ſtumbles; for in ſearching out the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Civil Societies, he conceited, <hi>That Multitudes of Men after a Deluge, a Famine, or a Peſtilence, met together like Herds of Cattel without any Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, until the ſtrongeſt Bodies and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Minds got the Maſtery of their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows</hi>; even as it is (ſaith he) among <hi>Bulls, Bears and Cocks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf, forgetting his firſt Doctrine, tells us, the firſt <hi>Heroical Kings</hi> were choſen by the People for their deſerving well of the Multitude; either by teaching them ſome New Arts, or by Warring for them, or by Gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93433:218"/>
them together, or by Dividing Land amongſt them; alſo <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had another Fancy, that thoſe Men who prove wiſe of Mind, were by Nature intended to be Lords, and Govern; and thoſe which were Strong of Body were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to obey, and to be Servants. But this is a dangerous and uncertain Rule, and not without ſome Folly; for if a Man prove both <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Strong,</hi> what will <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> have done with him? as he was <hi>Wiſe,</hi> he could be no Servant, and as he had <hi>Strength,</hi> he could not be a Maſter; beſides, to ſpeak like a Philoſopher, <hi>Nature</hi> intends all things to be perfect both in Wit and Strength. The Folly or Imbecillity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from ſome Errour in Generation or Education; for Nature aims at <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> in all her Works.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Suarez</hi> the Juſuite riſeth up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Royal Authority of <hi>Adam,</hi> in defence of the Freedom and Liberty of the people; and thus argues. By Right of Creation (ſaith he) <hi>Adam</hi> had only <hi>Oeconomical</hi> power, but not <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi>; he had a power over his Wife, and a Fatherly power over his Sons,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93433:219"/>
whilſt they were not made Free: he might alſo in proceſs of Time have Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and a Compleat Family; and in that Family he might have compleat <hi>Oeconomical Power.</hi> But after that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies began to be multiplied, and Men to be ſeparated, and become the Heads of ſeveral Families; they had the ſame power over their Families. But <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Power</hi> did not begin, until Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies began to be gathered together into one perfect Community; wherefore as the Community did not begin by the Creation of <hi>Adam,</hi> nor by his will alone, but of all them which did agree in this Community: So we cannot ſay that <hi>Adam Naturally</hi> had Political Primacy in that Community; for that cannot be gathered by any Natural Principles, becauſe by the Force of the Law of Nature alone, it is not due unto any Progenitor, to be alſo King of his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. And if this be not gathered out of the Principles of Nature, we cannot ſay, God by a ſpecial Gift or Providence gave him this Power; For there is no Revelation of this, nor Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Scripture. Hitherto <hi>Suarez.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:93433:219"/>Whereas he makes <hi>Adam</hi> to have a Fatherly power over his Sons, and yet ſhuts up this power within one Family, he ſeems either to imagine, that all <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s Children lived within one Houſe, and under one Roof with their Father; or elſe, as ſoon as any of his Children lived out of his Houſe, they ceaſed to be Subject, and did thereby become Free. For my part, I cannot believe that <hi>Adam</hi> (although he were ſole Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of the World) had any ſuch ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Palace, as might contain any ſuch Conſiderable part of his Children. It is likelier, that ſome mean Cottage or Tent did ſerve him to keep his Court in. It were hard he ſhould loſe part of his Authority, becauſe his Children lay not within the Walls of his Houſe. But if <hi>Suarez</hi> will allow all <hi>Adam</hi>'s Children to be of his Family, howſoever they were ſeparate in Dwellings; if their Habitations were either Contiguous, or at ſuch Diſtance, as might eaſily receive his Fatherly Commands. And that all that were under his Commands, were of his Family, although they had many Children or Servants married, having themſelves alſo Children. Then I ſee
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93433:220"/>
no reaſon, but that we may call <hi>Adam</hi>'s Family a Commonwealth, except we will wrangle about Words: For <hi>Adam</hi> living 930 years, and ſeeing 7 or 8 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents from himſelf, he might live to command of his Children and their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity a Multitude far bigger, than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Commonwealths and Kingdoms.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3.) I know the <hi>Politicians</hi> and <hi>Civil Lawyers</hi> do not agree well about the Definition of a Family, and <hi>Bodin</hi> doth ſeem in one place to confine it to a Houſe; yet in his Definition, he doth enlarge his meaning to all <hi>Perſons</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Obedience</hi> of One and the ſame Head of the Family; and he approves better of the propriety of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Word for a Family, which is derived from a Word that ſignifies a Head, a Prince, or Lord, than the <hi>Greek</hi> Word for a Family, which is derived from <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which ſignifies a Houſe. Nor doth <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> confine a Family to One Houſe; but eſteems it to be made of thoſe that daily converſe together: whereas before him, <hi>Charondas</hi> called a Family <hi>Homoſypioi,</hi> thoſe that feed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether out of one common <hi>Pannier.</hi> And
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93433:220"/>
                        <hi>Epimenides</hi> the <hi>Cretian,</hi> terms a Family <hi>Homocapnoi,</hi> thoſe that ſit by a Common Fire, or Smoak. But let <hi>Suarez</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what he pleaſe by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; if he will but confeſs, as he needs muſt, that <hi>Adam</hi> and the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> had Abſolute power of Life and Death, of Peace and War, and the like, within their Houſes or Families; he muſt give us leave at leaſt, to call them Kings of their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or Families; and if they be ſo by the Law of Nature, what Liberty will be left to their Children to diſpoſe of?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> gives the Lie to <hi>Plato,</hi> and thoſe that ſay <hi>Political</hi> and <hi>Oeconomical</hi> Societies are all one, and do not differ <hi>Specie,</hi> but only <hi>Multitudine &amp; Pauci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate</hi>; as if there were no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a Great Houſe and a Little City. All the Argument I find he brings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them is this.</p>
                     <p>The Community of Man and Wife,<note place="margin">Ariſt. Pol. Lib. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>2.</hi>
                        </note>
differs from the Community of Maſter and Servant, becauſe they have ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ends. The Intention of Nature by Conjunction of Male and Female, is Generation; but the Scope of Maſter and Servant, is Preſervation: ſo that a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93433:221"/>
Wife and a Servant are by Nature di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed, becauſe Nature does not work like the <hi>Cutlers of Delphos,</hi> for ſhe makes but one thing for one Uſe. If we allow this Argument to be ſound, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doth follow but only this, That Conjugal and Deſpotical Communities do differ. But it is no conſequence, That therefore, <hi>Oeconomical</hi> and <hi>Political</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties do the like: for though it prove a Family to conſiſt of two diſtinct Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, yet it follows not, that a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and a Commonwealth are diſtinct; becauſe, as well in the Commonweal, as in the Families, both theſe Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities are found.</p>
                     <p>And as this Argument comes not home to our Point, ſo it is not able to prove that Title which it ſhews for; for if it ſhould be granted (which yet is falſe) that <hi>Generation</hi> and <hi>Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> differ about the <hi>Individuum,</hi> yet they agree in the General, and ſerve both for the Conſervation of Mankind; Even as ſeveral Servants differ in the particular Ends or Offices; as one to Brew, and another to Bake; yet they agree in the general Preſervation of the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93433:221"/>
Family. Beſides, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> confeſſes, that amongſt the <hi>Barbarians</hi> (as he calls all them that are not <hi>Grecians</hi>) a Wife and a Servant are the ſame, becauſe by Nature, no <hi>Barbarian</hi> is fit to Govern; It is fit the <hi>Grecians</hi> ſhould rule over the <hi>Barbarians</hi>; for by Nature a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant and a <hi>Barbarian</hi> is all one: their Family conſiſts only of an Ox for a Man-Servant, and a Wife for a Maid; ſo they are fit only to rule their Wives and their Beaſts. Laſtly, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (if it had pleaſed him) might have remembred, That Nature doth not always make one Thing but for one Uſe: he knows, the Tongue ſerves both to Speak, and to Taſte.</p>
                     <p n="4">(4.) But to leave <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Suarez</hi>; he ſaith that <hi>Adam</hi> had Fatherly Power over his Sons, whilſt they were not made Free. Here I could wiſh that the Jeſuite had taught us, how and when Sons become Free: I know no means by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It is the Favour I think of the Parents only, who when their Children are of Age and Diſcretion to eaſe their Parents of part of their Fatherly Care,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93433:222"/>
are then content to remit ſome part of their Fatherly authority; therefore the Cuſtom of ſome Countreys doth in ſome Caſes Enfranchiſe the Children of ſufe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Parents, but many Nations have no ſuch Cuſtome, but on the contrary have ſtrict Laws for the Obedience of Children: the Judicial Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> giveth full power to the Father to ſtone his diſobedient Son, ſo it be done in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a Magiſtrate: And yet it did not belong to the Magiſtrate to enquire and examine the juſtneſs of the Cauſe; But it was ſo decreed, leſt the Father ſhould in his Anger, ſuddenly, or ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kill his Son.</p>
                     <p>Alſo by the Laws of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and of the People of the Upper <hi>Aſia,</hi> and of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> and by the Laws of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> the Parents have power of Life and Death over their Children.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romans,</hi> even in their moſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Eſtate, had this Law in force, and this Power of Parents was ratified and amplified by the Laws of the Twelve Tables, to the enabling of Parents to ſell their Children two or three times
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93433:222"/>
over. By the help of the Fatherly Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Rome</hi> long flouriſhed, and oftentimes was freed from great Dangers. The Fathers have drawn out of the very <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies</hi> their own Sons; when being <hi>Tribunes</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they have publiſhed Laws ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Sedition.</p>
                     <p>Memorable is the Example of <hi>Caſſius,</hi> who threw his Son headlong out of the Conſiſtory, publiſhing the Law <hi>Agraria,</hi> for the Diviſion of Lands, in the behoof of the People; and afterwards, by his own private Judgment put him to Death, by throwing him down from the <hi>Tarpei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Rock; the Magiſtrates and People ſtanding thereat amazed, and not daring to reſiſt his Fatherly Authority, although they would with all their Hearts, have had that Law for the Diviſion of Land: by which it appears, it was lawful for the Father to diſpoſe of the Life of his Child, contrary to the Will of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates or People. The <hi>Romans</hi> alſo had a Law, that what the Children got, was not their own, but their Fathers; although <hi>Solon</hi> made a Law, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted the Son from Nouriſhing of his Father, if his Father had taught him
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93433:223"/>
no Trade, whereby to get his Living.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Suarez</hi> proceeds, and tells us, That in Proceſs of Time, <hi>Adam</hi> had compleat <hi>Oeconomical</hi> Power. I know not what this compleat <hi>Oeconomical</hi> Power is, nor how, or what it doth really and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially differ from Political: If <hi>Adam</hi> did, or might exerciſe the ſame Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which a King doth now in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, then the Kinds of Power are not diſtinct; and though they may receive an Accidental Difference by the Amplitude, or Extent of the Bounds of the One beyond the Other; yet ſince the like Difference is alſo found in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical</hi> Eſtates, It follows that <hi>Oeconomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> and <hi>Political</hi> Power, differ no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, than a Little Commonweal differs from a Great One. Next, ſaith <hi>Suarez, Community did not begin at the Creation of</hi> Adam. It is true, becauſe he had no body to Communicate with; yet Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity did preſently follow his Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that by his Will alone: for it was in his power only (who was Lord of All) to appoint what his Sons ſhould have in <hi>Proper,</hi> and what in <hi>Common</hi>; ſo that <hi>Propriety</hi> and <hi>Community</hi> of Goods did follow Originally from him;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93433:223"/>
and it is the Duty of a Father, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide as well for the Common Good of his Children, as the Particular.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>Suarez</hi> Concludes, That by the Law of Nature alone, it is not due unto any Progenitor, to be alſo <hi>King</hi> of his <hi>Poſterity.</hi> This Aſſertion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed point-blank by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who expreſly affirmeth, That the firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ought to have been Princes of their Poſterity. And until <hi>Suarez</hi> bring ſome Reaſon for what he ſaith, I ſhall truſt more to <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s Proofs, than to his Denials.</p>
                     <p n="5">(5.) But let us Condeſcend a while to the Opinion of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Suarez,</hi> and all thoſe, who place Supreme pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the Whole People; and ask them if their meaning be, That there is but one and the ſame power in all the people of the World; ſo that no power can be granted, except all the Men upon the Earth meet and agree, to chooſe a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour.</p>
                     <p>An Anſwer is here given by <hi>Suarez,</hi> That it is ſcarce poſſible, nor yet expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93433:224"/>
that All Men in the World ſhould be gathered together into One Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: It is likelier, that either never, or for a very ſhort time, that this power was in this manner, in the whole Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Men collected; but a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Creation, men began to be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into ſeveral Commonwealths; and this diſtinct power was in each of them.</p>
                     <p>This Anſwer of <hi>Scarce poſſible,</hi> nor yet <hi>Expedient</hi>: —It is likelier begets a new doubt, how this diſtinct power comes to each particular Community, when God gave it to the whole Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude only, and not to any particular Aſſembly of Men. Can they ſhew, or prove, that ever the whole Multitude met, and divided this power which God gave them in Groſs, by breaking into parcels, and by appointing a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct power to each ſeveral Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth? Without ſuch a Compact I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee (according to their own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples) how there can be any Election of a Magiſtrate by any Commonwealth, but by a meer Uſurpation upon the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the whole World. If any think
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93433:224"/>
that particular Multitudes at their own Diſcretion, had power to divide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into ſeveral Commonwealths; thoſe that think ſo, have neither Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon nor Proof for ſo thinking: and thereby a Gap is opened for every pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Factious Multitude, to raiſe a New Commonwealth, and to make more Commonweals than there be Families in the World. But let this alſo be yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, That in each particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, there is a Diſtinct Power in the Multitude. Was a General Meeting of a Whole Kingdom ever known for the Election of a Prince? Is there any Example of it ever found in the Whole World? To conceit ſuch a thing, is to imagine little leſs than an Impoſſibility. And ſo by Conſequence, no one Form of Government, or King, was ever eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed according to this ſuppoſed Law of Nature.</p>
                     <p n="6">(6.) It may be anſwered by ſome, That if either the Greateſt part of a Kingdom, or if a ſmaller part only by Themſelves, and all the Reſt by <hi>Proxy</hi>; or if the part not concurring in Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, do after, by a <hi>Tacit</hi> Aſſent ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93433:225"/>
the Act of Others, That in all theſe Caſes, it may be ſaid to be the Work of the whole Multitude.</p>
                     <p>As to the Acts of the Major part of a Multitude, it is true, that by Politick Humane Conſtitutions, it is oft ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Voices of the moſt ſhall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-rule the Reſt; and ſuch Ordinances bind, becauſe, where. Men are Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by an humane Power; that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that doth Aſſemble them, can alſo Limit and Direct the manner of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of that Power, and by ſuch <hi>Derivative</hi> Power, made known by Law or Cuſtom, either the greater part, or two Thirds, or Three parts of Five, or the like, have power to overſway the Liberty of their Oppoſites. But in Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies that take their Authority from the Law of Nature, it cannot be ſo: for what Freedom or Liberty is due to any Man by the Law of Nature, no Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Power can alter, limit or diminiſh; no One Man, nor a Multitude, can give away the Natural Right of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Law of Nature is unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and howſoever One Man may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Another in the Uſe or Exerciſe of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93433:225"/>
his Natural Right, yet thereby No Man loſeth the Right of it ſelf; for the Right and the Uſe of the Right may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed, as Right and Poſſeſſion are oft diſtinct. Therefore, unleſs it can be proved by the Law of Nature, that the <hi>Major,</hi> or ſome other part, have Power to over rule the Reſt of the Multitude; It muſt follow, that the Acts of <hi>Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes</hi> not Entire, are not Binding to All, but only to ſuch as Conſent unto them.</p>
                     <p n="7">(7.) As to the point of <hi>Proxy</hi>; it cannot be ſhewed or proved, That all thoſe that have been Abſent from Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Elections, did ever give their Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to ſome of their Fellows. I ask but one Example out of the Hiſtory of the whole World, Let the Commonweal be but named, wherever the Multitude, or ſo much as the Greateſt part of it conſented, either by Voice or by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curation, to the Election of a Prince. The Ambition ſometimes of One Man, ſometimes of Many, or the Faction of a City or Citizens, or the Mutiny of an Army, hath ſet up or put down Princes; but they have never tarried for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Order by proceeding of the whole <hi>Multitude.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="46" facs="tcp:93433:226"/>Laſtly, if the ſilent Acceptation of a Governour by part of the People, be an Argument of their Concurring in the Election of him; by the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Tacit Aſſent of the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth may be maintained: From whence it follows, that every Prince that comes to a Crown, either by <hi>Succeſſion, Conqueſt,</hi> or <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation,</hi> may be ſaid to be Elected by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; which Inference is too ridiculous; for in ſuch Caſes, the People are ſo far from the Liberty of <hi>Specification,</hi> that they want even that of <hi>Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">(8.) But it is in vain to argue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Liberty of the People in the Election of Kings, as long as men are perſwaded, that Examples of it are to be found in Scripture. It is fit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to diſcover the Grounds of this Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: It is plain by an Evident Text, that it is one thing to chooſe a King, and another thing to ſet up a King over the People; this latter power the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had, but not the former. This diſtinction is found moſt evident in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.15. where the Law of God

ſaith, <hi>Him ſhalt thou ſet King over thee, whom the Lord ſhall chooſe</hi>; ſo God muſt <hi>Eligere,</hi> and the People only do <hi>Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuere.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> in his Eight Book of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Policy,</hi> clearly expounds this Diſtinction; the words are worthy the citing: <hi>Heaps of Scripture</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are alledged, concerning the Solemn Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or Inauguration of</hi> Saul, David, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon <hi>and others, by Nobles, Ancients, and the people of the Commonwealth of</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael; as if theſe Solemnities were a kind of Deed, whereby the Right of Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is given; which ſtrange, untrue, and unnatural conceits, are ſet abroad by Seed-men of Rebellion, only to animate unquiet Spirits, and to feed them with poſſibilities of Aſpiring unto the Thrones, if they can win the Hearts of the People; whatſoever Hereditary Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle any other before them may have. I ſay theſe unjuſt and inſolent Poſitions, I would not mention, were it not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make the Countenance of Truth more Orient. For unleſs we will openly proclaim Defiance unto all Law, Equity and Reaſon, we muſt (for there is no other Remedy) acknowledg, that in Kingdoms Hereditary, Birth-right
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93433:227"/>
giveth Right unto Sovereign Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Death of the Predeceſſor, putteth the Succeſſor by Blood in Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin. Thoſe publick Solemnities before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, do either ſerve for an open Teſtification of the Inheritor's Right, or belong to the Form of inducing of him into poſſeſſion of that thing he hath Right unto. This is Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Power to ſet a King over themſelves. No doubt but if the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had had power to chooſe their King, they would never have made choice of <hi>Joas,</hi> a Child but of ſeven years old, nor of <hi>Manaſſes</hi> a Boy of Twelve; ſince (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith) <hi>Wo to the Land whoſe King is a Child:</hi> Nor is it probable they would have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected <hi>Joſias,</hi> but a very Child, and a Son to ſo wicked and Idolatrous a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as that his own Servants mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered him; and yet all the people ſet up this young <hi>Joſias,</hi> and ſlew the Conſpirators of the Death of <hi>Ammon</hi> his Father; which Juſtice of the People, God rewarded, by making this <hi>Joſias</hi> the moſt Religious King, that ever that Nation enjoyed.</p>

                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:93433:227"/>(9.) Becauſe it is affirmed, that the People have Power to chooſe, as well what Form of Government, as what Governours they pleaſe; of which mind is <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> in thoſe Places we cited at firſt. Therefore it is neceſſary to Examine the Strength of what is ſaid in Defence of popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Common-weals, againſt this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Form of Kingdoms, which I maintain'd. Here I muſt firſt put the Cardinal in mind of what he affirms in cold Blood, in other Places; where he ſaith, <hi>God when he made all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind of one Man, did ſeem openly to ſignifie, that he rather approved the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of one Man, than of many.</hi> Again, God ſhewed his Opinion, when he endued not only Men, but all Creatures with a Natural Propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to <hi>Monarchy</hi>; neither can it be doubted, but a Natural Propenſity is to be referred to God, who is Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Nature. And again; in a Third Place, What Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment God confirmed by his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, may be gathered by that Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal, which he inſtituted amongſt the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93433:228"/>
                        <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which was not <hi>Ariſtocratical,</hi> (as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith) but plainly <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chichal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">(10.) Now if God, (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith) hath taught us by Natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, ſignified to us by the Creation, and confirmed by his own Example, the Excellency of Monarchy, why ſhould <hi>Bellarmine</hi> or We doubt, but that it is Natural? Do we not find, that in every Family, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of One Alone is moſt Natural? God did always Govern his own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by Monarchy only. The <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, Dukes, Judges,</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> were all Monarchs. There is not in all the Scripture, Mention or Approbation of any other Form of Government. At the time when Scripture ſaith, <hi>There was no King in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>but that every Man did that which was Right in his Own Eyes</hi>; Even then, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were under the Kingly Government of the Fathers of particular Families: For in the <hi>Conſultation,</hi> after the <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamitical</hi> War, for providing Wives for the <hi>Benjamites,</hi> we find, the Elders of the Congregation bare only Sway.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93433:228"/>
                        <hi>Judges</hi> 21.16. To them alſo were Complaints to be made, as appears by Verſe 22. And though mention be made of all the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> all the <hi>Congregation,</hi> and all the <hi>People</hi>; yet by the Term of <hi>All,</hi> the Scripture means only all the Fathers, and not all the whole Multitude, as the Text. plainly expounds it ſelf in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1.2. where <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks unto all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to the <hi>Captains,</hi> the <hi>Judges,</hi> and to every Governour, the Chief of the Fathers; ſo the Elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are expounded to be the Chief of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.12. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.2.</p>
                     <p>At that time alſo, when the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> begg'd a King of <hi>Samuel,</hi> they were Governed by Kingly Power. God out of a ſpecial Love and Care to the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> did chooſe to be their King himſelf, and did govern them at that time by his <hi>Viceroy Samuel,</hi> and his Sons; and therefore God tells <hi>Samuel, They have not rejected Thee, but Me, that I ſhould not Reign over them.</hi> It ſeems they did not like a King by Deputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93433:229"/>
but deſired one by Succeſſion, like all the Nations. All Nations belike had Kings then, and thoſe by Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, not by Election: for we do not find the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> prayed, that they themſelves might chooſe their Own King; they dream of no ſuch Liberty, and yet they were the Elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> gathered together. If other Nations had Elected their own Kings, no doubt but they would have been as deſirous to have imitated Other Nations as well in the <hi>Electing,</hi> as in the Having of a King.</p>

                        <hi>Aristotle,</hi> in his Book of <hi>Politicks,</hi> when he comes to compare the ſeveral Kinds of Government, he is very reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in diſcourſing what Form he thinks Beſt: he diſputes ſubtilely to and fro of many Points, and Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly of many Errours, but concludes nothing himſelf. In all thoſe Books, I find little Commendation of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. It was his Hap to live in thoſe Times when the <hi>Graecians</hi> abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſeveral Common-wealths, who had then Learning enough to make
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93433:229"/>
them ſeditious. Yet in his <hi>Ethicks,</hi> he hath ſo much good Manners, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs in right down words, <hi>That Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy is the best Form of Government, and a Popular Eſtate the worſt.</hi> And though he be not ſo free in his <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> yet the Neceſſity of Truth hath here and there extorted from him, that which amounts no leſs to the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Monarchy; he confeſſeth it to be Firſt, the Natural, and the Divineſt Form of Government; and that the Gods themſelves did live under a Monarchy. What can a Heathen ſay more?</p>
                     <p>Indeed, the World for a long time knew no other ſort of Government, but only Monarchy. The Beſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the Greateſt Strength, the Moſt Stability, and eaſieſt Government, are to be found all in Monarchy, and in no other Form of Government. The New Platforms of Commonweals were firſt hatched in a Corner of the World, amongſt a few Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> which have been imitated by very few other places. Thoſe very Cities
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93433:230"/>
were firſt, for many Years, governed by Kings, untill <hi>Wantonneſs, Ambition,</hi> or <hi>Faction</hi> of the People, made them attempt new kinds of Regiment; all which Mutations proved moſt Bloody and Miſerable to the Authors of them; happy in nothing, but that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued but a ſmall time.</p>
                     <p n="11">(11.) A little to manifeſt the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of Popular Government, let us but examine the moſt Flouriſhing Democracy that the World hath ever known; I mean that of <hi>Rome.</hi> Firſt, for the <hi>Durability</hi>; at the moſt, it laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but 480 Years (for ſo long it was from the Expulſion of <hi>Tarquin,</hi> to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caeſar.</hi>) Whereas both the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Monarchy laſted, without Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, at the leaſt twelve hundred Years, and the Empire of the <hi>East</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued 1495 Years.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For the Order of it, during theſe 480 Years, there was not any One ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Form of Government in <hi>Rome:</hi> for after they had once loſt the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Power of Kings, they could not
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93433:230"/>
find upon what Form of Government to reſt: their Fickleneſs is an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that they found things amiſs in every Change. At the Firſt they choſe two <hi>Annual Conſuls</hi> inſtead of Kings. Secondly, thoſe did not pleaſe them long, but they muſt have <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes</hi> of the People to defend their Liberty. Thirdly, they leave <hi>Tribunes</hi> and <hi>Conſuls,</hi> and chooſe them <hi>Ten Men</hi> to make them Laws. Fourthly, they call for <hi>Conſuls</hi> and <hi>Tribunes</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ſometimes they chooſe <hi>Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> which were Temporary Kings, and ſometimes <hi>Military Tribunes,</hi> who had <hi>Conſular</hi> Power. All theſe ſhiftings cauſed ſuch notable Alteration in the Government, as it paſſeth Hiſtorians to find out any Perfect Form of Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſo much Confuſion: One while the Senate made Laws, another while the People. The Diſſentions which were daily between the Nobles and the Commons, bred thoſe memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Seditions about <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury,</hi> about <hi>Marriages,</hi> and about <hi>Magiſtracy.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the <hi>Graecian,</hi> the <hi>Apulian,</hi> and the <hi>Druſian</hi> Seditions, filled the Market-Places,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93433:231"/>
the Temples, and the Capitol it ſelf, with Blood of the Citizens; the <hi>Social</hi> War was plainly Civil; the Wars of the Slaves, and the other of the Fencers; the Civil Wars of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> and <hi>Sylla,</hi> of <hi>Cataline,</hi> of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> the <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus, Lepidus</hi> and <hi>Antonius</hi>: All theſe ſhed an Ocean of Blood within <hi>Italy</hi> and the Streets of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, for their Government, let it be allowed, that for ſome part of this time it was <hi>Popular,</hi> yet it was Popular as to the City of <hi>Rome</hi> only, and not as to the Dominions, or whole Empire of <hi>Rome</hi>; for no <hi>Democratie</hi> can extend further than to One City. It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to Govern a Kingdom, much leſs many Kingdoms by the whole People, or by the Greateſt Part of them.</p>
                     <p n="12">(12.) But you will ſay, yet the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire grew all up under this kind of Popular Government, and the City became Miſtreſs of the World. It is not ſo; for <hi>Rome</hi> began her Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire under <hi>Kings,</hi> and did perfect it
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93433:231"/>
under Emperours; it did only encreaſe under that Popularity: Her greateſt Exaltation was under <hi>Trajan,</hi> as her longeſt Peace had been under <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus.</hi> Even at thoſe times, when the <hi>Roman</hi> Victories abroad did amaze the World, then the Tragical Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Citizens at home, deſerved Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration from their vanquiſhed E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. What though in that Age of her Popularity, ſhe bred many admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Captains and Commanders (each of which was able to lead an Army, though many of them were but ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited by the People?) yet all of them were not able to ſupport her in times of Danger; but ſhe was forced in her greateſt Troubles to create a <hi>Dictator</hi> (who was a King for a time) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by giving this Honourable Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> that the laſt Refuge in Perils of States, is to fly to <hi>Regal Authority.</hi> And though <hi>Romes</hi> Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Eſtate for a while was miraculou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly upheld in Glory by a greater Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence than her own; yet in a ſhort time, after manifold Alterations, ſhe was ruined by her Own Hands. <hi>Suis &amp;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93433:232"/>
ipſa Roma viribus ruit</hi>: For the Arms ſhe had prepared to conquer other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were turned upon her Self, and Civil Contentions at laſt ſetled the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment again into a Monarchy.</p>
                     <p n="13">(13.) The Vulgar Opinion is, that the firſt Cauſe why the <hi>Democratical</hi> Government was brought in, was to curb the Tyranny of Monarchies. But the Falſhood of this doth beſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the firſt Flouriſhing Popular Eſtate of <hi>Athens,</hi> which was founded, not becauſe of the Vices of their laſt King, but that his Vertuous Deſerts were ſuch as the People thought no Man Worthy enough to ſucceed him; a pretty wanton Quarrel to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy! For when their King <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drus</hi> underſtood by the Oracle, that his Country could not be ſaved, unleſs the King were ſlain in the Battel: He in Diſguiſe entered his Enemies Camp, and provoked a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldier to make him a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for his own Kingdom, and with his Death ended the Royal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for after him was never any
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93433:232"/>
more Kings of <hi>Athens.</hi> As <hi>Athens</hi> thus for Love of her <hi>Codrus,</hi> changed the Government, ſo <hi>Rome</hi> on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, out of Hatred to her <hi>Tarquin,</hi> did the like. And though theſe two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Commonweals did for contrary Cauſes aboliſh Monarchy, yet they both agreed in this, that neither of them thought it fit to change their State into a <hi>Democracy:</hi> but the one choſe <hi>Archontes,</hi> and the other <hi>Conſuls</hi> to be their Governours; both which did moſt reſemble Kings, and continued, untill the People, by leſſening the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of theſe their Magiſtrates, did by degrees and ſtealth bring in their Popular Government. And I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, never any Democratical State ſhewed it ſelf at firſt fairly to the World by any Elective Entrance, but they all ſecretly crept in by the Back-door of Sedition and Faction.</p>
                     <p n="14">(14.) If we will liſten to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe who ſhould beſt know the Nature of Popular Government, we ſhall find no reaſon for good men to deſire or chooſe it. <hi>Xenophon,</hi> that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:93433:233"/>
brave Scholar and Souldier diſallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Athenian</hi> Common-weal, for that they followed that Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment wherein the Wicked are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in greateſt Credit, and Vertuous men kept under. They expelled <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtides</hi> the Juſt; <hi>Themistocles</hi> died in Baniſhment; <hi>Meltiades</hi> in Priſon; <hi>Phocion,</hi> the moſt virtuous and juſt man of his Age, though he had been choſen forty five times to be their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, yet he was put to Death with all his Friends, Kindred and Servants, by the Fury of the People, without Sentence, Accuſation, or any Cauſe at All. Nor were the People of <hi>Rome</hi> much more favourable to their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies; they baniſhed <hi>Rutilius, Metellus, Coriolanus,</hi> the Two <hi>Scipio</hi>'s and <hi>Tully:</hi> the worſt men ſped beſt; for as <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon</hi> ſaith of <hi>Athens,</hi> ſo <hi>Rome</hi> was a Sanctuary for all Turbulent, Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented and Seditious Spirits. The Impunity of Wicked men was ſuch, that upon pain of Death, it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden all Magiſtrates to Condemn to Death, or Baniſh any Citizen, or to deprive him of his Liberty, or ſo
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93433:233"/>
much as to whip him for what Offence ſoever he had committed, either againſt the Gods or Men.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> ſold Juſtice as they did other Merchandiſe; which made <hi>Plato</hi> call a Popular Eſtate a Fair, where every thing is to be ſold. The Officers when they entered upon their Charge, would brag, they went to a <hi>Golden Harveſt.</hi> The Corruption of <hi>Rome</hi> was ſuch, that <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> durſt carry Buſhels of Silver into the Aſſemblies, to purchaſe the Voices of the People. Many Citizens under their Grave Gowns, came Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into their Publick Meetings, as if they went to War. Often contrary Factions fell to Blows, ſometimes with Stones, and ſometimes with Swords; the Blood hath been ſuckt up in the Market Places with Spunges; the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Tiber</hi> hath been filled with the Dead Bodies of the Citizens, and the common Privies ſtuffed full with them.</p>
                     <p>If any man think theſe Diſorders in Popular States were but Caſual, or ſuch as might happen under any kind of Government, he muſt know,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93433:234"/>
that ſuch Miſchiefs are unavoidable, and of neceſſity do follow all <hi>Democratical</hi> Regiments; and the Reaſon is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, becauſe the Nature of all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is, to deſire Liberty without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, which cannot be but where the Wicked bear Rule; and if the People ſhould be ſo indiſcreet, as to advance Vertuous Men, they loſe their Power: for that, Good Men would favour none but the Good, which are always the fewer in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and the Wicked and Vicious (which is ſtill the Greateſt Part of the People) ſhould be excluded from all Preferment, and in the end, by little and little, Wiſe Men ſhould ſeize upon the State, and take it from the People.</p>
                     <p>I know not how to give a better Character of the People, than can be gathered from ſuch Authors as lived amongſt or near the Popular States; <hi>Thucydides, Xenophon, Livy, Tacitus, Cicero,</hi> and <hi>Salust,</hi> have ſet them out in their Colours. I will borrow ſome of their Sentences.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="63" facs="tcp:93433:234"/>
                        <q>There is nothing more uncertain than the People; their Opinions are as variable and ſudden as Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts; there is neither Truth nor Judgment in them; they are not led by Wiſdom to judg of any thing, but by Violence and Raſhneſs; nor put they any Difference between things True and Falſe. After the manner of Cattel, they follow the Herd that goes before; they have a Cuſtom always to favour the Worſt and Weakeſt; they are moſt prone to Suſpitions, and uſe to Condemn men for Guilty upon any falſe Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion; they are apt to believe all News, eſpecially if it be ſorrowful; and like Fame, they make it more in the Believing; when there is no Author, they fear thoſe Evils which themſelves have feigned; they are moſt deſirous of New Stirrs and Changes, and are Enemies to Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et and Reſt; Whatſoever is Giddy or Head-ſtrong, they account Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and Couragious; but whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is Modeſt or Provident, ſeems ſluggiſh; each Man hath a Care of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93433:235"/>
his Particular, and thinks baſely of the Common Good; they look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Approaching Miſchiefs as they do upon Thunder, only every Man wiſheth it may not touch his own Perſon; it is the Nature of them, they muſt Serve baſely, or Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer proudly; for they know no Mean.</q>
Thus do they paint to the Life this Beaſt with many Heads. Let me give you the Cypher of their Form of Government; As it is begot by Sedition, ſo it is nouriſhed by Arms: It can never ſtand without Wars, either with an Enemy abroad, or with Friends at Home. The only Means to preſerve it, is, to have ſome powerful Enemies near, who may ſerve inſtead of a King to Govern it, that ſo, though they have not a King amongſt them, yet they may have as good as a King Over them: For the Common Danger of an Enemy keeps them in better Unity, than the Laws they make themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="15">
                        <pb n="65" facs="tcp:93433:235"/>(15.) Many have exerciſed their Wits in parallelling the Inconveniencies of Regal and Popular Government; but if we will truſt Experience before Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations Philoſophical, it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but this one Miſchief of Sedition which neceſſarily waits upon all Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, weighs down all the Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that can be found in Monarchy, tho they were never ſo many. It is ſaid, Skin for Skin, yea, all that a Man hath will he give for his Life; and a Man will give his Riches for the ranſome of his Life. The way then to examine what proportion the miſchiefs of Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Tyranny have one to another, is to enquire in what kind of Government moſt Subjects have loſt their Lives: Let <hi>Rome,</hi> which is magnified for her Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, and villified for the Tyrannical Monſters the Emperours, furniſh us with Examples. Conſider whether the Cruelty of all the Tyrannical Emperours that ever ruled in this City, did ever ſpill a quarter of the Blood that was pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out in the laſt hundred Years of her glorious Commonwealth. The Murthers by <hi>Tyberius, Domitian,</hi> and <hi>Commodus,</hi> put all together, cannot match that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93433:236"/>
Tragedy which was acted in that one Sedition between <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sylla,</hi> nay, even by <hi>Sylla</hi>'s part alone (not to mention the Acts of <hi>Marius</hi>) were four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ten Senators put to Death, fifteen Conſuls, two thouſand and ſix hundred Gentlemen, and a hundred thouſand others.</p>
                     <p>This was the Heighth of the <hi>Roman</hi> Liberty; Any Man might be killed that would. A Favour not fit to be granted under a Royal Government. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of thoſe Licentious Times are briefly touched by <hi>Plutarch</hi> in theſe Words. <hi>Sylla</hi> (ſaith he) fell to ſhedding of Blood, and filled all <hi>Rome</hi> with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and unſpeakable Murthers—This was not only done in <hi>Rome,</hi> but in all the Cities of <hi>Italy</hi> throughout, there was no Temple of any God whatſoever, no Altar in any Bodies Houſe, no Liberty of Hoſpital, no Fathers Houſe, which was not embrued with Blood, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Murthers, the Huſbands were ſlain in the Wives Arms, and the Children in the Mothers Laps; and yet they that were ſlain for private Malice, were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in reſpect of thoſe that were
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93433:236"/>
Murthered only for their Goods— He openly ſold their Goods by the Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſitting ſo proudly in his Chair of State, that it grieved the People more to ſee their Goods packt up by them to whom he gave, or diſpoſed them, than to ſee them taken away. Sometimes he would give a whole Country, or the whole Revenues of certain Cities, unto Women for their Beauties, or to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Jeſters, Minſtrels, or wicked Slaves made free. And to ſome he would give other Mens Wives by force, and make them be Married againſt their Wills. Now let <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Suetonius</hi> be ſearched, and ſee if all their cruel Emperours can match this Popular Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany, in ſuch an Univerſal Slaughter of Citizens, or Civil Butchery. God only was able to match him, and over-match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, by fitting him with a moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Death, juſt anſwerable to his Life; for as he had been the Death of many thouſands of his Country-men, ſo as many thouſands of his own Kindred in the Fleſh were the Death of him, for he died of an Impoſtume, which corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Fleſh in ſuch ſort, that it turned all to Lice; he had many about him to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93433:237"/>
ſhift him continually Night and Day; yet the Lice they wiped from him were nothing to them that multiplied upon him, there was neither Apparel, Linnen, Baths, Waſhings, nor Meat it ſelf, but was preſently filled with Swarms of this vile Vermine. I cite not this to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate the Bloody Acts of any Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Princes, nor will I plead in Defence of their Cruelties; only in the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, I maintain the Miſchiefs to a State to be leſs Univerſal under a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant King; for the Cruelty of ſuch Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants extends ordinarily no further than to ſome particular Men that offend him, and not to the whole Kingdom: It is truly ſaid by his late Majeſty King <hi>James,</hi> A King can never be ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly Vicious, but he will generally fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour Juſtice, and maintain ſome Order; except in the Particulars wherein his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Luſt carries him away. Even cruel <hi>Domitian, Dionyſius</hi> the Tyrant, and many others, are commended by Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians for great Obſervers of Juſtice: A natural Reaſon is to be rendered for it; It is the Multitude of People, and the abundance of their Riches, which are the only Strength and Glory of every
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93433:237"/>
Prince: The Bodies of his Subjects do him Service in War, and their Goods ſupply his preſent Wants, therefore, if not out of Affection to his People, yet out of Natural Love to Himſelf, every Tyrant deſires to preſerve the Lives, and protect the Goods of his Subjects, which cannot be done but by Juſtice, and if it be not done, the Prince's Loſs is the greateſt; on the contrary, in a Popular State, evey man knows the Publick good doth not depend wholly on his Care, but the Common-wealth may well enough be governed by others though he tend only his Private Benefit, he never takes the Publick to be his Own Buſineſs; thus, as in a Family, where one Office is to be done by many Servants, one looks upon another, and every own leaves the Buſineſs for his Fellow, until it is quite neglected by all; nor are they much to be blamed for their Negligence, ſince it is an even Wager, their Ignorance is as great: For Magiſtrates among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, being for the moſt part Annual, do always lay down their Office before they underſtand it; ſo that a Prince of a Duller Underſtanding, by Uſe and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93433:238"/>
Experience muſt needs excell them; again, there is no Tyrant ſo barbarouſly Wicked, but his own reaſon and ſenſe will tell him, that though he be a God, yet he muſt dye like a Man; and that there is not the Meaneſt of his Subjects but may find a means to revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the Injuſtice that is offered him: hence it is that great Tyrants live con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in baſe fears, as did <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Elder; <hi>Tiberius, Caligula,</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> are noted by <hi>Suetonius</hi> to have been frighted with Panick fears. But it is not ſo where wrong is done to any Particular Perſon by a Multitude, he knows not who hurt him, or who to complain of, or to whom to addreſs himſelf for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. Any man may boldly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his Malice and Cruelty in all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Aſſemblies. There is no Tyranny to be compared to the Tyranny of a Multitude.</p>
                     <p n="16">(16.) What though the Government of the People be a thing not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, much leſs defended, yet many men pleaſe themſelves with an Opinion, that though the People may not Govern; yet they may partake and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93433:238"/>
joyn with a King in the Government, and ſo make a State mixed of Popular and Regal Power, which they take to be the beſt tempered and equalleſt Form of Government. But the Vanity of this Fancy is too evident, it is a meer Impoſſibility or Contradiction, for if a King but once admit the People to be his Companions, he leaves to be a King, and the State becomes a Democracy; at leaſt, he is but a Titular and no Real King, that hath not the Sovereignty to Himſelf; for the having of this alone, and nothing but this makes a King to be a King. As for that Shew of Popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which is found in ſuch Kingdoms as have General Aſſemblies for Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation about making Publick Laws: It muſt be remembred that ſuch Meetings do not ſhare or divide the Sovereignty with the Prince: but do only deliberate and adviſe their Supreme Head, who ſtill reſerves the Abſolute Power in himſelf; for if in ſuch Aſſemblies, the King, the Nobility, and People have equal Shares in the Sovereignty, then the King hath but one Voice, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility likewiſe one, and the People one, and then any two of theſe Voices ſhould
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93433:239"/>
have Power to over-rule the third; thus the Nobility and Commons to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſhould have Power to make a Law to bind the King, which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet ſeen in any Kingdom, but if it could, the State muſt needs be Popular and not Regal.</p>
                     <p n="17">(17.) If it be Unnatural for the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to chuſe their Governours, or to Govern, or to partake in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what can be thought of that dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Concluſion which is made by too many, that the Multitude may Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, or Depoſe their Prince, if need be? Surely the Unnaturalneſs, and Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of this Poſition cannot ſufficiently be expreſſed: For admit that a King make a Contract or Paction with his People, either Originally in his Anceſtors, or perſonally at his Coronation (for both theſe Pactions ſome dream of, but cannot offer any proof for either) yet by no Law of any Nation can a Contract be thought broken, except that firſt a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tryal be had by the Ordinary Judge of the Breakers thereof, or elſe every Man may be both Party and Judge in his own caſe, which is abſur'd once to be
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93433:239"/>
thought, for then it will lye in the hands of the headleſs Multitude when they pleaſe to caſt off the Yoke of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment (that God hath laid upon them) to judge and puniſh him, by whom they ſhould be judged and puniſhed themſelves. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> can tell us, what Judges the Multitude are in their own caſe, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, The Judgment of the Multitude in Diſpoſing of the Sovereignty may be ſeen in the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory, where we may find many good Emperours Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by the People, and many bad Elected by them: <hi>Nero, Heliogabalus, Otho, Vitellius,</hi> and ſuch other Monſters of Nature, were the Minions of the Multitude, and ſet up by them, <hi>Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nax, Alexander, Severus, Gordianus, Gallus, Emilianus, Quintilius, Aurelia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Tacitus, Probus,</hi> and <hi>Numerianus</hi>; all of them good Emperours in the Judgment of all Hiſtorians, yet Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by the Multitude.</p>
                     <p n="18">(18.) Whereas many out of an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Fear pretend the Power of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be neceſſary for the repreſſing of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93433:240"/>
the Inſolencies of Tyrants; wherein they propound a Remedy far worſe than the Diſeaſe, neither is the Diſeaſe indeed ſo frequent as they would have us think. Let us be judged by the Hiſtory even of our own Nation: We have enjoyed a Succeſſion of Kings from the Conqueſt now for above 600 years (a time far longer than ever yet any Popular State could continue) we reckon to the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of twenty ſix of theſe Princes ſince the <hi>Norman</hi> Race, and yet not one of theſe is taxed by our Hiſtorians for Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Government. It is true, two of theſe Kings have been Depoſed by the People, and barbarouſly Murthered, but neither of them for Tyranny: For as a learned Hiſtorian of our Age ſaith, <hi>Edward</hi> the Second and <hi>Richard</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond were not inſupportable either in their Nature or Rule, and yet the People, more upon Wantonneſs than for any want, did take an unbridled Courſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our Hiſtorians is reported to be of a Good and Vertuous Nature, and not Unlearned: they impute his defects ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Fortune than either to Council or Carriage of his Affairs, the Depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93433:240"/>
of him was a violent Fury, led by a Wife both Cruel and unchaſt, and can with no better Countenance of Right be juſtified, than may his lamentable both Indignities and Death it ſelf. Likewiſe the Depoſition of King <hi>Richard</hi> II, was a tempeſtuous Rage, neither Led or Reſtrained by any Rules of Reaſon or of State — Examine his Actions without a diſtempered Judgment, and you will not Condemn him to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding either Inſufficient or Evil; weigh the Imputations that were objected againſt him, and you ſhall find nothing either of any Truth or of great moment; <hi>Hollingshed</hi> writeth, That he was moſt Unthankfully uſed by his Subjects; for although, through the frailty of his Youth, he demeaned himſelf more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely than was agreeable to the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty of his Eſtate, yet in no Kings Days were the Commons in greater Wealth, the Nobility more honoured, and the Clergy leſs wronged; who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, in the Evil-guided Strength of their will, took head againſt him, to their own headlong deſtruction after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; partly during the Reign of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> his next Succeſſor, whoſe greateſt
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93433:241"/>
Atchievements were againſt his own People, in Executing thoſe who Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired with him againſt King <hi>Richard</hi>: But more eſpecially in ſucceeding times, when, upon occaſion of this Diſorder, more <hi>Engliſh</hi> Blood was ſpent, than was in all the Foreign Wars together which have been ſince the Conqueſt.</p>
                     <p>Twice hath this Kingdom been miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably waſted with Civil War, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them occaſioned by the Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of any Prince. The Cauſe of the Barons Wars is by good Hiſtorians at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the ſtubbornneſs of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, as the Bloody variance of the Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and the late Rebellion, ſprung from the Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs of the People. Theſe three Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Wars have diſhonoured our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongſt Strangers, ſo that in the Cenſures of Kingdoms, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> is ſaid to be the King of Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his Subjects willing Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; the King of <hi>France</hi> King of Aſſes, becauſe of their infinite Taxes and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions; but the King of <hi>England</hi> is ſaid to be the King of <hi>Devils,</hi> becauſe of his Subjects often Inſurrections againſt, and Depoſitions of their Princes.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">(1.) HItherto I have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſhew the Natural Inſtitution of Regal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and to free it from Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to an Arbitrary Election of the People: It is neceſſary alſo to enquire whether Humane Laws have a Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over Princes; becauſe thoſe that maintain the Acquiſition of Royal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction from the People, do ſubject the Exerciſe of it to Poſitive Laws. But in this alſo they err; for as Kingly Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is by the Law of God, ſo it hath no inferiour Law to limit it.</p>
                     <p>The Father of a Family governs by no other Law than by his own Will; not by the Laws and Wills of his Sons or Servants. There is no Nation that allows Children any Action or Remedy
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93433:242"/>
for being unjuſtly Governed; and yet for all this, every Father is bound by the Law of Nature to do his beſt for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of his Family; but much more is a King always tyed by the ſame Law of Nature to keep this general Ground, That the ſafety of the Kingdom be his Chief Law: He muſt remember, That the Profit of every Man in particular, and of all together in general, is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways one and the ſame; and that the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick is to be preferred before the Private; And that the force of Laws muſt not be ſo great as natural Equity it ſelf, which cannot fully be compriſed in any Laws whatſoever, but is to be left to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Atchievement of thoſe who know how to manage the Affairs of State, and wiſely to Ballance the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Profit with the Counterpoize of the Publick, according to the infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Times, Places, Perſons; a Proof unanſwerable, for the ſuperiority of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces above Laws, is this, That there were Kings long before there were any Laws: For a long time the Word of a King was the only Law; and if Practice (as ſaith Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi>) declare the Greatneſs of Authority, even the beſt
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93433:243"/>
Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> were not tied to any Law; but they did whatſoever they pleaſed in the greateſt Matters.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) The Unlimited Juriſdiction of Kings is ſo amply deſcribed by <hi>Samuel,</hi> that it hath given Occaſion to ſome to imagine, that it was, but either a Plot or Trick of <hi>Samuel</hi> to keep the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment himſelf and Family, by frighting the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> with the Miſchiefs in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, or elſe a prophetical Deſcription only of the future ill Government of <hi>Saul</hi>: But the Vanity of theſe Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures are judiciouſly diſcovered in that Majeſtical Diſcourſe of the true Law of free Monarchy; wherein it is evidently ſhewed, that the Scope of <hi>Samuel</hi> was to teach the People a dutiful Obedience to their King, even in thoſe things which themſelves did eſteem Miſchievous and Inconvenient: for by telling them what a King would do, he indeed inſtructs them what a Subject muſt ſuffer; yet not ſo that it is Right for Kings to do Injury, but it is Right for them to go Unpuniſhed by the People if they do it: So that in this Point it is all one, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Samuel</hi> deſcribe a King, or a Tyrant,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93433:243"/>
for Patient Obedience is due to both; no Remedy in the Text againſt Tyrants, but in crying and praying unto God in that Day. But howſoever in a Rigorous Conſtruction <hi>Samuel</hi>'s deſcription be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to a Tyrant; yet the Words by a Benigne Interpretation may agree with the manners of a Juſt King; and the Scope and Coherence of the Text doth beſt imply the more Moderate, or Qualified Senſe of the Words; for as Sir <hi>W. Raleigh</hi> confeſſes, all thoſe Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences and Miſeries which are reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Samuel</hi> as belonging to Kingly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, were not Intollerable, but ſuch as have been born, and are ſtill born, by free Conſent of Subjects to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Princes; Nay at this day, and in this Land, many Tenants by their Tenures and Services are tyed to the ſame Subjection, even to Subordinate and Inferiour Lords: To ſerve the King in his Wars, and to till his Ground, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreeable to the Nature of Subjects, but much deſired by them; according to their ſeveral Births, and Conditions: The like may be ſaid for the Offices of Women-Servants, Confectioners, Cooks, and Bakers, for we cannot think that the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93433:244"/>
King would uſe their Labours without giving them Wages, ſince the Text it ſelf mentions a Liberal Reward of his Servants.</p>
                     <p>As for the taking of the Tenth of their Seed, of their Vines, and of their Sheep, it might be a Neceſſary Proviſion for their Kings Houſehold, and ſo belong to the Right of Tribute: For whereas is mentioned the taking of the Tenth; it cannot agree well to a Tyrant, who obſerves no Proportion in fleecing his People.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, The taking of their Fields, Vineyards, and Olive-trees, if it be by Force or Fraud, or without juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, to the Dammage of Private Perſons only, it is not to be defended; but if it be upon the publick Charge and General Conſent, it might be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as neceſſary at the firſt Erection of a Kingdom; For thoſe who will have a King, are bound to allow him Royal maintenance, by providing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues for the CROWN, Since it is both for the Honour, Profit, and Safety too of the People, to have their King
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93433:244"/>
Glorious, Powerful, and abounding in Riches, beſides, we all know the Lands and Goods of many Subjects may be oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Legally taken by the King, either by Forfeitures, Eſcheat, Attainder, Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawry, Confiſcation, or the like. Thus we ſee <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Character of a King may literally well bear a mild Senſe, for greater probability there is that <hi>Samuel</hi> ſo meant, and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſo underſtood it; to which this may be added, that <hi>Samuel</hi> tells the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> this will be the manner of the King that ſhall Reign over you: And Ye ſhall cry becauſe of your King which Ye ſhall have choſen you; that is to ſay: Thus ſhall be the common Cuſtom or Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Proceeding of <hi>Saul</hi> your King; Or, as the Vulgar Latine renders it, this ſhall be the Right or Law of your King: not Meaning, as ſome expound it, the Caſual Event, or Act of ſome <hi>individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um vagum,</hi> or indefinite King, that might happen one day to Tyrannize over them. So that <hi>Saul,</hi> and the conſtant Practice of <hi>Saul,</hi> doth beſt agree with the Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Senſe of the Text. Now that <hi>Saul</hi> was no Tyrant, we may note that the People <hi>asked a King, as All Nations had.</hi>
                        <pb n="84" facs="tcp:93433:245"/>
God anſwers, and bids <hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>hear the Voice of the People, in all things which they ſpake,</hi> and <hi>appoint them a King.</hi> They did not ask a Tyrant, and to give them a Tyrant, when they asked a King, had not been to hear their Voice in all things, But rather when they asked an Egge, to have given them a Scorpion: Unleſs we will ſay, that all Nations had Tyrants. Beſides, we do not find in all Scripture that <hi>Saul</hi> was Puniſhed, or ſo much as Blamed, for committing any of thoſe Acts which <hi>Samuel</hi> deſcribes: and if <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi>'s drift had been only to terrifie the People, he would not have forgotten to foretell <hi>Saul</hi>'s bloody Cruelty, in Murthering 85 innocent Prieſts, and ſmiting with the Edge of the Sword the City of <hi>Nob,</hi> both Man, Woman, and Child. Again, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> never ſhrank at theſe Conditions propoſed by <hi>Samuel,</hi> but accepted of them, as ſuch as all other Nations were bound unto. For their Concluſion is, <hi>Nay, but we will have a King over <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, that We alſo may be like all the Nations, and that Our King may Judge us, and go out before us to fight our Battels.</hi> Meaning he ſhould earn his Privileges, by doing the work for
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93433:245"/>
them, by Judging them, and Fighting for them. Laſtly, Whereas the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Peoples crying unto the Lord, argues they ſhould be under ſome Tyrannical Oppreſſion; we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the Peoples Complaints and Cries are not always an Argument of their living under a Tyrant. No Man can ſay King <hi>Solomon</hi> was a Tyrant, yet all the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd that <hi>Solomon</hi> made their Yoke grievous, and therefore their Prayer to <hi>Rehoboam</hi> is, <hi>Make thou the grievous Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of thy Father</hi> Solomon, <hi>and his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will ſerve thee.</hi> To conclude, it is true, <hi>Saul</hi> loſt his Kingdom, but not for being too Cruel or Tyrannical to his Subjects, but by being too Merciful to his Enemies; his ſparing <hi>Agag</hi> when he ſhould have ſlain him, was the Cauſe why the Kingdom was torn from him.</p>
                     <p n="3">(3.) If any deſire the direction of the New Teſtament, he may find our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our limiting and diſtinguiſhing Royal Power, <hi>By giving to</hi> Caeſar <hi>thoſe things that were</hi> Caeſar<hi>'s, and to God thoſe things

Our Saviour hath well apportioned our Money for <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and our ſelves for God, for otherwiſe, what ſhall God's ſhare be, if all be <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>'s. The Fathers mention no Reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any Power to the Laws of the Land, or to the People. S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> in his Apology for <hi>David,</hi> expreſly ſaith, He was a King, and therefore bound to no Laws, becauſe Kings are free from the Bonds of any Fault.

                     <p>When the <hi>Jews</hi> asked our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, whether they ſhould pay Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, he did not firſt demand what the Law of the Land was, or whether there was any Statute <hi>againſt it,</hi> nor enquired whether the Tribute were given by Conſent of the People, nor adviſed them to ſtay their Payment till

they ſhould grant it; he did no more but look upon the Superſcription, and concluded, <hi>This Image you ſay is</hi> Caeſar's, <hi>therefore give it to</hi> Caeſar. Nor muſt it here be ſaid, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> taught this Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon only to the conquered <hi>Jews,</hi> for in this he gave Direction for all Nations, who are bound as much in Obedience to their Lawful Kings, as to any <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour</hi> or <hi>

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93433:247"/>
ſay that the Carpenters Rule builds an Houſe, and not the Carpenter; for the Law is but the Rule or Inſtrument of the Ruler. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> concludes, <hi>for this Cauſe pay you Tribute alſo, for they are God's Miniſters attending conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually upon this very thing.

                        </gap>, Render or Reſtore Tribute, as a due. Alſo St. <hi>Peter</hi> doth moſt clearly expound this Place of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>Submit your ſelves to every Ordinance of Man, for the Lord's ſake, whether it be to the King as Supreme, or unto Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, as unto them that are ſent by him.</hi> Here the very ſelf ſame Word (Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, or <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>) which St. <hi>Paul</hi> coupleth with Power, St. <hi>Peter</hi> conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the King, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, thereby to manifeſt that King and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er are both one. Alſo St. <hi>Peter</hi> expounds his own Words of Humane Ordinance, to be the King, who is the <hi>Lex Loquens,</hi> a ſpeaking Law; he cannot mean that Kings themſelves are an humane Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, ſince <hi>St. Paul</hi> calls the Supreme Power, The Ordinance of God; and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93433:248"/>
the Wiſdom of God ſaith, <hi>By me Kings Reign</hi>: But his meaning muſt be, that the Laws of Kings are humane Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. Next, the <hi>Governours that are ſent by him</hi>; that is by the King, not by God, as ſome corruptly would wreſt the Text, to juſtifie Popular Governours as authorized by God; whereas in Grammatical Conſtruction [Him] the Relative muſt be referred to the next Antecedent, which is King; beſides, the Antitheſis between Supreme and Sent, proves plainly that the Governours were ſent by Kings; for if the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours were ſent by God, and the King be an Humane Ordinance, then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that the Governours were Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, and not the King; Or if it be ſaid, that both King and Governours are ſent by God, then they are both equal, and ſo neither of them Supreme. Therefore <hi>St. Peter</hi>'s Meaning is in ſhort, Obey the Laws of the King, or of his Miniſters. By which it is evident, that neither <hi>St. Peter,</hi> nor <hi>St. Paul,</hi> intended other Form of Government than only Monarchical, much leſs any Subjection of Princes to humane Laws.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="91" facs="tcp:93433:248"/>That familiar Diſtinction of the School-men, whereby they ſubject Kings to the Directive, but not to the Coactive Power of Laws, is a Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that Kings are not bound by the poſitive Laws of any Nation, ſince the compulſory Power of Laws is that which properly makes Laws to be Laws by binding Men by Rewards or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to Obedience; whereas the Direction of the Law is but like the Advice and Direction which the Kings Council gives the King, which no Man ſays is a Law to the King.</p>
                     <p n="4">(4.) There want not thoſe who Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the firſt Invention of Laws was to bridle and moderate the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great Power of Kings; but the truth is, the Original of Laws was for the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Multitude in order: Popular Eſtates could not ſubſiſt at all without Laws, whereas Kingdoms were Govern'd many Ages without them. The People of <hi>Athens,</hi> aſſoon as they gave over Kings, were forced to give Power to <hi>Draco</hi> firſt, then to <hi>Solon,</hi> to make them
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93433:249"/>
Laws, not to bridle Kings, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and tho many of their Laws were very ſevere and bloody, yet for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence they bare to their Law-makers, they willingly ſubmitted to them. Nor did the People give any Limited Power to <hi>Solon,</hi> but an Abſolute Juriſdiction, at his Pleaſure to Abrogate and Confirm what he thought fit, the People never challenging any ſuch Power to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: ſo the People of <hi>Rome</hi> gave to the <hi>Ten Men,</hi> who were to chuſe and correct their Laws for the <hi>Twelve Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> an Abſolute Power, without any Appeal to the People.</p>
                     <p n="5">(5.) The reaſon why Laws have been alſo made by Kings, was this; when Kings were either buſied with Wars, or diſtracted with publick Cares, ſo that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very private Man could not have Acceſs to their Perſons, to learn their Wills and Pleaſure; then of neceſſity were Laws invented, that ſo every particular Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject might find his <hi>Prince's Pleaſure</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyphered to him in the Tables of his Laws, that ſo there might be no need to reſort unto the King; but either for the Interpretation or Mitigation of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93433:249"/>
or Rigorous Laws, or elſe in new Caſes, for a Supplement where the Law was Defective. By this means both King and People were in many things eaſed: Firſt, The King by giving Laws doth free himſelf of great and intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Troubles, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did himſelf by chuſing <hi>Elders.</hi> Secondly, The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have the Law as a Familiar Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher and Interpreter of the King's Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which being publiſhed throughout the Kingdom, doth repreſent the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Majeſty of the King: Alſo the Judges and Magiſtrates, (whoſe help in giving Judgment in many Cauſes Kings have need to uſe) are reſtrained by the Common Rules of the Law from uſing their own Liberty to the Injury of others, ſince they are to judge according to the Laws, and not follow their own Opinions.</p>
                     <p n="6">(6.) Now albeit Kings, who make the Laws, be (as King <hi>James</hi> teacheth us) above the Laws; yet will they Rule their Subjects by the Law; and a King, governing in a ſetled Kingdom, leaves to be a King, and degenerates into a Tyrant, ſo ſoon as he ſeems to Rule according to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93433:250"/>
his Laws; yet where he ſees the Laws Rigorous or Doubtful, he may miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and interpret. General Laws made in Parliament, may, upon known Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to the King, by his Authority be Mitigated or Suſpended, upon Cauſes only known to him. And although a King do frame all his Actions to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws, yet he is not bound thereto, but at his good Will, and for good Example: Or ſo far forth as the General Law of the Safety of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weal doth naturally bind him; for in ſuch ſort only Poſitive Laws may be ſaid to bind the King, not by being Poſitive, but as they are naturally the Beſt or Only Means for the Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Common-Wealth. By this means are all Kings, even Tyrants and Conquerours, bound to preſerve the Lands, Goods, Liberties, and Lives of all their Subjects, not by any Munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pial Law of the Land, ſo much as the Natural Law of a Father, which binds them to ratifie the Acts of their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Fathers and Predeceſſors, in things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Publick Good of their Subjects.</p>
                     <p n="7">
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:93433:250"/>(7.) Others there be that affirm, that although Laws of themſelves do not bind Kings, yet the Oaths of Kings at their Coronations tye them to keep all the Laws of their Kingdoms. How far this is true, let us but examine the Oath of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> at their Coronation; the words whereof are theſe, <hi>Art thou pleaſed to cauſe to be adminiſtred in all thy Judgments indifferent and upright Juſtice, and to uſe Diſcretion with Mercy and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? Art thou pleaſed that our upright Laws and Cuſtoms be obſerved, and doſt thou promiſe that thoſe ſhall be protected and maintained by thee?</hi> Theſe two are the Articles of the King's Oath, which concern the Laity or Subjects in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; to which the King anſwers affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matively. Being firſt demanded by the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury, Pleaſeth it you to confirm and obſerve the Laws and Cuſtoms of Ancient Times, granted from God, by juſt and devout Kings, unto the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Nation, by Oath unto the ſaid Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Eſpecially the Laws, Liberties, and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms granted unto the Clergy and Laity by the famous King</hi> Edward. We may obſerve, in theſe Words of the Articles
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93433:251"/>
of the Oath, that the King is required to obſerve not all the Laws, but only the Upright, and that with Diſcretion and Mercy. The Word Upright can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mean all Laws, becauſe in the Oath of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, I find Evil and Unjuſt Laws mentioned, which the King ſwears to aboliſh; and in the <hi>Old Abridgment</hi> of <hi>Statutes,</hi> ſet forth in <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Eighth's days, the King is to ſwear wholly to put out Evil Laws; which he cannot do, if he be bound to all Laws. Now what Laws are Upright and what Evil, who ſhall Judge but the King, ſince he ſwears to adminiſter Upright Juſtice with Diſcretion and Mercy (or as <hi>Bracton</hi> hath it) <hi>aequitatem praecipiat, &amp; miſericordiam.</hi> So that in effect, the King doth ſwear to keep no Laws, but ſuch as in <hi>His Judgment</hi> are Upright, and thoſe not literally always, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Equity of his Conſcience, joyn'd with Mercy, which is properly the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Chancellour rather than of a Judge; and if a King did ſtrictly ſwear to obſerve all the Laws, he could not without Perjury give his Conſent to the Repealing or Abrogating of any Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute by Act of Parliament, which
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93433:251"/>
would be very miſchievable to the State.</p>
                     <p>But let it be ſuppoſed for Truth, that Kings do ſwear to obſerve all the Laws of their Kingdom, yet no man can think it reaſon that Kings ſhould be more bound by their Voluntary Oaths than Common Perſons are by theirs. Now if a private perſon make a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, either with Oath or without Oath, he is no further bound than the Equity and Juſtice of the Contract ties him; for a Man may have Relief againſt an unreaſonable and unjuſt Promiſe, if either Deceit, or Error, or Force, or Fear induced him thereunto: Or if it be hurtful or grievous in the performance. Since the Laws in many Caſes give the King a Prerogative above common Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, I ſee no Reaſon why he ſhould be denied the Priviledg which the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of his Subjects doth enjoy.</p>
                     <p>Here is a fit place to examine a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion which ſome have moved, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a Sin for a Subject to diſobey the King, if he Command any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Laws? For ſatisfaction in this
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93433:252"/>
point, we muſt reſolve that not only in Humane Laws, but even in Divine, a thing may be commanded contrary to Law, and yet Obedience to ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is neceſſary. The ſanctifying of the Sabbath is a Divine Law; yet if a Maſter command his Servant not to go to Church upon a Sabbath-Day, the beſt Divines teach us, That the Servant muſt obey this Command, though it may be Sinful and Unlawfull in the Maſter; becauſe the Servant hath no Authority or Liberty to examine and judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Maſter ſin or no in ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding: For there may be a juſt Cauſe for a Maſter to keep his Servant from Church, as appears <hi>Luke</hi> 14.5. yet it is not fit to tie the Maſter to acquaint his Servant with his ſecret Counſels, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Neceſſity: And in ſuch Caſes, the Servant's not going to Church, becomes the Sin of the Maſter, and not of the Servant. The like may be ſaid of the King's commanding a Man to ſerve him in the Wars, he may not examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the War be Juſt or Unjuſt, but muſt Obey, ſince he hath no Commiſſion to Judge of the Titles of Kingdoms, or Cauſes of War; nor hath any Subject
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93433:252"/>
Power to Condemn his King for breach of his own Laws.</p>
                     <p n="8">(8.) Many will be ready to ſay, It is a Slaviſh and Dangerous Condition to be ſubject to the Will of any One Man, who is not ſubject to the Laws. But ſuch Men conſider not, 1. That the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of a King is to be above all Laws, for the good only of them that are under the Laws, and to defend the Peoples Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, as His Majeſty graciouſly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in His <hi>Speech</hi> after His laſt Anſwer to the Petition of <hi>Right:</hi> Howſoever ſome are afraid of the Name of <hi>Prerogative,</hi> yet they may aſſure themſelves the Caſe of Subjects would be deſperately miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable without it. The Court of <hi>Chancery</hi> it ſelf is but a Branch of the King's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, to Relieve men againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable rigour of the Law, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it is no better than a Tyrant, ſince <hi>Summum Jus,</hi> is <hi>Summa Injuria.</hi> General Pardons, at the Coronation and in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are but the Bounty of the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative. 2. There can be no Laws with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Supreme Power to command or make them. In all <hi>Ariſtocraties</hi> the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are above the Laws, and in all <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craties</hi>
                        <pb n="100" facs="tcp:93433:253"/>
the People. By the like Reaſon, in a Monarchy the King muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be above the Laws; there can be no Soveraign Majeſty in him that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them; that which giveth the very Being to a King, is the Power to give Laws; without this Power he is but an Equivocal King. It skills not which way Kings come by their Power, whether by <hi>Election, Donation, Succeſſion,</hi> or by any other means; for it is ſtill the manner of the Government by Supreme Power that makes them properly Kings, and not the means of obtaining their Crowns. Neither doth the Diverſity of Laws, nor contrary Cuſtoms, whereby each Kingdom differs from another, make the Forms of Common-Weal different, unleſs the Power of making Laws be in ſeveral Subjects.</p>
                     <p>For the Confirmation of this point, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, That a perfect Kingdom is that wherein the King rules all things according to his Own Will, for he that is called a King according to the Law, makes no kind of Kingdom at all. This it ſeems alſo the <hi>Romans</hi> well underſtood to be moſt neceſſary in a Monarchy; for
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93433:253"/>
though they were a People moſt greedy of Liberty, yet the Senate did free <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> from all Neceſſity of Laws, that he might be free of his own Authority, and of abſolute Power over himſelf and over the Laws, to do what he pleaſed, and leave undone what he liſt, and this Decree was made while <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was yet abſent. Accordingly we find, that <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian</hi> the great Lawyer delivers it for a Rule of the Civil Law; <hi>Princeps, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus ſolutus eſt,</hi> The Prince is not bound by the Laws.</p>
                     <p n="9">(9.) If the Nature of Laws be advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly weighed, the Neceſſity of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being above them may more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt it ſelf; we all know that a Law in General is the command of a Superior Power. Laws are divided (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> divides the Word of God) into written and unwritten, not for that it is not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at all, but becauſe it was not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the firſt Deviſers or Makers of it. The Common Law (as the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor <hi>Egerton</hi> teacheth us) is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cuſtom of the Realm. Now concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cuſtoms, this muſt be conſidered, that for every Cuſtom there was a time when it was no Cuſtom; and the firſt
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93433:254"/>
Preſident we now have, had no Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent when it began; when every Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom began, there was ſomething elſe than Cuſtom that made it lawful, or elſe the beginning of all Cuſtoms were unlawful. Cuſtoms at firſt became Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful only by ſome Superiour, which did either Command or Conſent unto their beginning. And the firſt Power which we find (as it is confeſſed by all men) is the Kingly Power, which was both in this and in all other Nations of the World, long before any Laws, or any other kind of Government was thought of; from whence we muſt neceſſarily infer, that the Common Law it ſelf, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cuſtoms of this Land, were Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the Laws and Commands of Kings at firſt unwritten.</p>
                     <p>Nor muſt we think the Common Cuſtoms (which are the Principles of the Common Law, and are but few) to be ſuch, or ſo many, as are able to give ſpecial Rules to determine every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Cauſe. Diverſity of Caſes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and impoſſible to be regulated by any Law; and therefore we find, even in the Divine Laws which are delivered
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93433:254"/>
by <hi>Moſes,</hi> there be only certain Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Laws, which did not determine, but only direct the High-prieſt or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, whoſe Judgment in ſpecial Caſes did determine, what the General Law intended. It is ſo with the Common Law, for when there is no perfect Rule, Judges do reſort to thoſe Principles, or Common-Law Axiomes, whereupon former Judgments, in Caſes ſomewhat like, have been delivered by former Judges, who all receive Authority from the King, in his Right and Name to give Sentence according to the Rules and Preſidents of Antient Times: And where Preſidents have failed, the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es have reſorted to the General Law of Reaſon, and accordingly given Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without any Common Law to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them. Nay, many times, where there have been Preſidents to direct, they, upon better Reaſon only, have changed the Law, both in Cauſes Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Civil, and have not inſiſted ſo much on the Examples of former Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, as examined and corrected their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; thence it is that ſome Laws are now obſolete and out of uſe, and the Practice quite contrary to what it was in
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93433:255"/>
Former Times, as the Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour <hi>Egerton</hi> proves, by ſeveral Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                     <p>Nor is this ſpoken to derogate from the Common Law, for the Caſe ſtandeth ſo with the Laws of all Nations, although ſome of them have their Laws and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples written and eſtabliſhed: for wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to this, we have <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in his <hi>Ethiques,</hi> and in ſeveral places in his <hi>Politiques</hi>; I will cite ſome of them: <hi>Every Law,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is in the General, but of ſome things there can be no General Law — when therefore the Law ſpeaks in General, and ſomething falls out after beſides the General Rule: Then it is fit that what the Law maker hath omitted, or where he hath erred by ſpeaking general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it ſhould be corrected or ſupplied, as if the Law-maker himſelf were preſent to Ordain it. The Governour, whether he be one Man, or more, ought to be Lord over all thoſe things whereof it was impoſſible the Law ſhould exactly ſpeak, becauſe it is not eaſie to comprehend all things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der General Rules—whatſoever the Law cannot determine, it leaves to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours to give Judgment therein, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93433:255"/>
them to rectify whatſoever upon Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al thy find to be better than the Written Laws.</hi>

                     <p>Beſids, all Laws are of themſelves dumb, and ſome or other muſt be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Application of them to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, by examining all Circumſtances, to pronounce when they are broken, or by whom. This work of right Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Laws is not a thing eaſie or obvious for ordinary capacities; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires profound Abilities of Nature, for the beating out of the Truth, witneſs the Diverſity, and ſometimes the contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Opinions of the learned Judges, in ſome difficult Points.</p>
                     <p n="10">(10) Since this is the common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Laws, it is alſo moſt reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the Law-maker ſhould be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Application or Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Laws; and for this cauſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently the Kings of this Land have ſitten perſonally in Courts of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and are ſtill repreſentatively pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in all Courts; the Judges are but ſubſtituted, and called the King's Juſtices, and their Power ceaſeth when the King is in place. To this purpoſe <hi>Bracton,</hi> that learned Chief Juſtice, in the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93433:256"/>
Reign of Henry the Third, ſaith in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs terms; In doubtful and obſcure points the Interpretation and Will of our Lord the King is to be expected; ſince it is his part to interpret, who made the Law; for, as he ſaith in another place, <hi>Rex, &amp; non Alius debet Judicare, ſi So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus ad id ſufficere poſſit, &amp;c. The King, and no body elſe, ought to give Judgment, if he were able, ſince by virtue of his Oath he is bound to it; therefore the King ought to exerciſe Power as the Vicar or Miniſter of God: But if our Lord the King be not able to determine every Cauſe, to eaſe part of his Pains, by diſtributing the Burthen to more Perſons, he ought to chuſe Wiſe-Men fearing God, &amp;c. and make Juſtices of them.</hi> Much to the ſame purpoſe are the words of <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Book of <hi>Laws,</hi> written by his appointment by <hi>John Briton,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hereford: We will,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that Our own Juriſdiction be above all the Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of our Realm, ſo as in all manner of Felonies, Treſpaſſes, Contracts,</hi> and <hi>in all other Actions perſonal or real, We have Power to yield ſuch Judgements as do appertain without other Proceſs, whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we know the Right Truth as Judges.</hi>
                        <pb n="107" facs="tcp:93433:256"/>
Neither may this be taken to be meant of an imaginary Preſence of the King's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in His Courts, becauſe he doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after in the ſame place ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſet forth by themſelves the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of his Ordinary Courts; but muſt neceſſarily be underſtood of a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction remaining in the King's Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Perſon. And that this then was no New-made Law, or firſt brought in by the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſts, appears by a <hi>Saxon</hi> Law made by King <hi>Edgar,</hi> in theſe words, as I find them in Mr. <hi>Lambert. Nemo in lite Regem appellato, niſi quidem domi Juſtitiam conſequi, aut impetrare non poterit, ſin ſummo jure domi urgeatur, ad Regem, ut is Onus aliqua ex parte Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet, provocato. Let no man in Suit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the King, unleſs he may not get Right at home; but if the Right be too heavy for him, then let him go to the King to have it eaſed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As the Judicial Power of Kings was exerciſed before the Conqueſt, ſo in thoſe ſetled times after the Conqueſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Parliaments were much in uſe, there was a High-Court following the King, which was the place of Soveraign Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93433:257"/>
both for matter of Law and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as may appear by a Parliament in <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt's time, taking Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>That the Chancellour and the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Bench ſhould follow the King, to the end that he might have always at hand Able Men for his Direction in Suits that came before Him.</hi> And this was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the time that the Court of Common-Pleas was made ſtationary, which is an Evidence that the King reſerved a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Power, by which he did ſupply the Want, or correct the Rigour of the Common Law; becauſe the <hi>Poſitive Law,</hi> being grounded upon that which happens for the moſt part, cannot fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee every particular which Time and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience brings forth.</p>
                     <p n="12">(12.) Therefore though the Common Law be generally Good and Juſt, yet in ſome ſpecial Caſe it may need Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by reaſon of ſome conſiderable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance falling out, which at the time of the Law-making was not thought of. Alſo ſundry things do fall out, both in War and Peace, that require extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary help, and cannot wait for the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Care of Common Law, the which is
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:93433:257"/>
not performed, but altogether after one ſort, and that not without delay of help and expence of time; ſo that although all Cauſes are, and ought to be referred to the Ordinary Proceſs of common Law, yet rare matters from time to time do grow up meet, for juſt Reaſons, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the aid of the abſolute Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Prince; and the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> hath been underſtood of the Inſtitution then made of the ordinary Juriſdiction in <hi>Common Cauſes,</hi> and not for reſtraint of the Abſolute Authority, ſerving only in a few rare and ſingular Caſes: for though the Subjects were put to great dammage by <hi>Falſe Accuſations</hi> and <hi>Malicious Suggeſtions</hi> made to the King and His Council, eſpecially during the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, whilſt he was abſent in the Wars in <hi>France,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as in His Reign divers Statutes were made, That provided none ſhould be put to anſwer before the King and His Council without due Proceſs; yet it is apparent the neceſſity of ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings was ſo great, that both before <hi>Edward</hi> the Third's days, and in his time, and after his Death, ſeveral Statutes were made, to help and order the Proceedings
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93433:258"/>
of the King and his Council. As the Parliament in 28. <hi>Edw,</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, <hi>That the Chancellour and Juſtices of the King's Bench ſhould follow the King; that ſo he might have near unto him ſome that be learned in the Laws, which be able to order all ſuch matters as ſhall come unto the Court, at all times when need ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</hi> By the Statute of 37. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 18. <hi>Taliation</hi> was ordained, in caſe the <hi>Suggeſtion to the King proved untrue.</hi> Then 38. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 9. takes away <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,</hi> and appoints Impriſonment till the King and Party grieved be ſatisfied.

                     <p>At a Parliament at <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> 2. <hi>Ric.</hi> 2. when the Commons made Petition, <hi>That none might be forced by Writ out of</hi> Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, <hi>or by Privy Seal, to appear before the King and His Council, to anſwer touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Free-hold.</hi> The King's anſwer was, <hi>He thought it not reaſonable that He ſhould

be conſtrained to ſend for his Leiges upon Cauſes reaſonable: And albeit He did not purpoſe that ſuch as were ſent for ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi> [Finalment] <hi>peremptorily touching their Free-hold, but ſhould be remanded for tryal thereof, as Law required: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided always,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that at the Suit of the Party, where the King and His Council ſhall be credibly informed, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of Maintenance, Oppreſſion, or other Outrages, the Common Law cannot have duly her Courſe, in ſuch caſe the Counſel for the Party.</hi>

                     <p>Alſo in the 13<hi>th</hi> Year of his Reign when the Commons did pray, that upon pain of Forfeiture, the <hi>Chancellour</hi> or <hi>Council</hi> of the King, ſhould not after the end of the <hi>Parliament</hi> make any Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance againſt the Common Law; the King anſwered, <hi>Let it be uſed as it hath been uſed before this time, ſo as the Rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the King be ſaved, for the King will ſave His Regalities as His Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors have done.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, in the 4<hi>th</hi> year of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, when the <hi>Commons</hi> complained againſt <hi>Subpaena's,</hi> &amp; other Writs, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:93433:259"/>
upon falſe Suggeſtions; the King an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>That he would give in Charge to His Officers, that they ſhould abſtain more than before time they had, to ſend for His Subjects in that manner.

                     </p>
                     <p>Likewiſe when for the ſame Cauſe Complaint was made by the Commons, <hi>Anno</hi> 3. <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. the King's Anſwer was, <hi>Le Roy s'adviſera, The King will be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed</hi>; which amounts to a Denial for the preſent, by a Phraſe peculiar for the King's denying to paſs any Bill that hath paſſed the Lords and Commons.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Complaints of the Commons, and the Anſwers of the King, diſcover, That ſuch moderation ſhould be uſed, that the courſe of the common Law be ordinarily maintained, leſt Subjects be convented before the King and his Council without juſt cauſe, that the Proceedings of the Council-Table be not upon every ſlight Suggeſtion, nor
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:93433:259"/>
to determine finally concerning Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of Inheritance.

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:93433:261"/>
it; for Evidence whereof, we may in ſome points conſider the nature of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, becauſe in them only all Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes are made.</p>
                     <p n="12">(12.) Though the Name of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> ſaith) be of no great Antiquity, but brought in out of <hi>France,</hi> yet our Anceſtors, the <hi>Engliſh Saxons,</hi> had a Meeting, which they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The Aſſembly of the Wiſe</hi>; termed in <hi>Latine, Conventum Magnatum,</hi> or, <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentia Regis, Procerum<expan>

                     <p>Great are the Advantages which both the King and People may receive by a well-ordered Parliament; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more expreſſeth the Majeſty and Supream Power of a King, than ſuch an Aſſembly, wherein all his People ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:93433:261"/>
him for Soveraign Lord, and make all their Addreſſes to him by hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Petition and Supplication; and by their Conſent and Approbation do ſtrengthen all the Laws, which the King, at their Requeſt and by their Advice and Miniſtry, ſhall ordain. Thus they facilitate the Government of the King, by making the Laws unqueſtionable, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Subordinate Magiſtrates, or refractory Multitude. The benefit which accrews to the Subject by Parliaments, is, That by their Prayers and Petitions Kings are drawn many times to redreſs their juſt Grievances, and are overcome by their Importunity to grant many things which otherwiſe they would not yield unto; for the Voice of a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is eaſilier heard. Many Vexations of the People are without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the King; who in Parliament ſeeth and heareth his People himſelf; whereas at other times he commonly uſeth the Eyes and Ears of other Men.</p>
                     <p>Againſt the Antiquity of Parliaments we need not diſpute, ſince the more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient they be, the more they make for the Honour of Monarchy; yet there be
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93433:262"/>
certain Circumſtances touching the Forms of Parliaments, which are fit to be conſidered.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, We are to remember, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til about the time of the Conqueſt, there could be no Parliaments aſſembled of the General States of the whole Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe till thoſe days we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not learn it was entirely united into one Kingdom; but it was either divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeveral Kingdoms, or governed by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Laws. When <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> landed, he found 4 Kings in <hi>Kent</hi>; and the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Names of <hi>Dammonii, Durotriges, Belgae, Attrebatii, Trinobantes, Iceni, Silures,</hi> and the reſt, are plentiful Teſtimonies of the ſeveral Kingdoms of <hi>Britains,</hi> when the <hi>Romans</hi> left us. The <hi>Saxons</hi> divided us into 7 Kingdoms: when theſe <hi>Saxons</hi> were united all into a Monarchy, they had always the <hi>Danes</hi> their Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or their Maſters in the Empire, till <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confeſſors</hi> Days, ſince whoſe time the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued United, as now it doth: But for a thouſand Years before we cannot find it was entirely ſettled, during the time of any one King's Reign. As under the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93433:262"/>
                        <hi>Mercian</hi> Law: The <hi>Weſt Saxons</hi> were confined to the <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws; <hi>Eſſex, Norfolk, Suffolk,</hi> and ſome other Places, were vexed with <hi>Daniſh</hi> Laws; The <hi>Northumbrians</hi> alſo had their Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part. And until <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confeſſor</hi>'s Reign, who was next but one before the Conqueror, the Laws of the Kingdom were ſo ſeveral and uncertain, that he was forced to cull a few of the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different and beſt of them, which were from him called St. <hi>Edward</hi>'s Laws: Yet ſome ſay that <hi>Edgar</hi> made thoſe Laws, and that the <hi>Confeſſor</hi> did but reſtore and mend them. <hi>Alfred</hi> alſo gathered out of <hi>Mulmutius</hi> Laws, ſuch as he tranſlated into the <hi>Saxon</hi> Tongue. Thus during the time of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> the Laws were ſo variable, that there is little or no likelihood to find any conſtant Form of Parliaments of the whole Kingdom.</p>
                     <p n="13">(13) A ſecond Point conſiderable is, Whether in ſuch Parliaments, as was in the <hi>Saxon</hi>'s times, the Nobility and Clergy only were of thoſe Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, or whether the Commons were alſo called? Some are of Opinion, that though none of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws do
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:93433:263"/>
mention the Commons, yet it may be gathered by the word <hi>Wiſemen,</hi> the Commons are intended to be of thoſe Aſſemblies, and they bring (as they conceive) probable arguments to prove it, from the Antiquity of ſome Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs that do yet ſend Burgeſſes, and from the Proſcription of thoſe in <hi>Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Demeſne,</hi> not to ſend Burgeſſes to Parliament. If it be true, that the <hi>Weſt-Saxons</hi> had a Cuſtom to aſſemble Burgeſſes out of ſome of their Towns, yet it may be doubted, whether other Kingdoms had the ſame uſage; but ſure it is, that during the Heptarchy, the People could not Elect any Knights of the Shire, becauſe <hi>England</hi> was not then divided into Shires.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, there be of our Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians who do affirm, that <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt cauſed the Commons firſt to be Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by Knights and Burgeſſes of their own Appointment, for before his Time only certain of the Nobility and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of the Realm were called to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation about the moſt Important Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of State. If this Aſſertion be true, it ſeems a meer matter of Grace of this
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93433:263"/>
King, and proves not any Natural Right of the People, Originally to be admitted to chuſe their Knights and Burgeſſes of Parliament; though it had been more for the Honour of Parliaments, if a King, whoſe Title to the Crown had been better, had been Author of the Form of it; becauſe he made uſe of it for his unjuſt Ends. For thereby he ſecured himſelf againſt his Competitor and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Brother, by taking the Oaths of the Nobility in Parliament: and getting the Crown to be ſetled upon his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And as the King made uſe of the People, ſo they, by Colour of Parliament, ſerved their own turns; for after the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment of Parliaments by ſtrong hand, and by the Sword, they drew from him the <hi>Great Charter,</hi> which he grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the rather to flatter the Nobility and People, as Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> in his <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi> of <hi>Parliaments</hi> doth affirm, in theſe words: <hi>The great Charter was not Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally granted Legally and Freely; for</hi> Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>the Firſt did but <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurp the Kingdom, and therefore, the better to aſſure himſelf againſt</hi> Robert <hi>his Elder Brother, he flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Nobility and People with their Charters; yea, King</hi> John, <hi>that Confirmed
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93433:264"/>
them, had the like reſpect, for</hi> Arthur <hi>Duke of</hi> Britain <hi>was the undoubted Heir of the Crown, upon whom King</hi> John <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurped,</hi> and <hi>ſo to conclude, theſe</hi> Charters <hi>had their Original from Kings</hi> de facto, <hi>but not</hi> de jure— <hi>the Great Charter had firſt an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Birth by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation,</hi> and <hi>was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly foſtered and ſhewed to the World by Rebellion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="15">(15.) A third conſideration muſt be, that in the former Parliaments, inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and continued ſince King <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt's time, is not to be found the Uſage of any natural Liberty of the People; for all thoſe Liberties that are claimed in Parliament are the Liberties of Grace from the King, and not the Liberties of Nature to the People; for if the Liberty were natural, it would give Power to the Multitude to aſſemble themſelves <hi>When</hi> and <hi>Where</hi> they pleaſe, to beſtow Soveraignty, and by Pactions to limit and direct the Exerciſe of it. Whereas, the Liberties of Favour and Grace, which are claimed in Parliaments, are reſtrained both for Time, Place Perſons, and other Circumſtances, to the Sole Pleaſure of the King. The People can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93433:264"/>
aſſemble themſelves, but the King, by his Writs, calls them to what place he pleaſes; and then again ſcatters them with his Breath at an inſtant, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Cauſe ſhewed than his Will. Neither is the whole ſummoned, but only ſo many as the King's Writs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point. The prudent King <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, ſummoned always thoſe Barons of ancient Families, that were moſt wiſe to his Parliament, but omitted their Sons after their Death, if they were not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to their Parents in Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Nor have the whole People Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Election of Knights of the Shire or Burgeſſes, but only Freehold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Counties, and Freemen in the Cities and Burroughs; yet in the City of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> all the Houſe-holders, though they be neither Freemen nor Free-holders, have Voices in their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Burgeſſes. Alſo during the time of Parliament, thoſe Privileges of the Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> of freedom of Speech, power to puniſh their own Members, to examine the Proceedings and Demeanour of Courts of Juſtice and Officers, to have acceſs to the King's Perſon, and the like, are not due by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>any
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93433:265"/>
Natural Right, but are derived from the Bounty or Indulgence of the King, as appears by a ſolemn Recognition of the Houſe: for at the opening of the Parliament, when the Speaker is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the King, he, in the behalf and name of the whole Houſe of Commons, humbly craves of His Majeſty, That He would be pleaſed to grant them their <hi>Accuſtomed Liberties</hi> of freedom of Speech, of acceſs to his Perſon, and the reſt. Theſe Privileges are granted with a Condition implyed, That they keep themſelves within the Bounds and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of Loyalty and Obedience; for elſe why do the Houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict Puniſhment themſelves upon their own Members for tranſgreſſing in ſome of theſe points; and the King, as Head, hath many times puniſhed the Members for the like Offences. The Power which the King giveth, in all his Courts, to his Judges or others to puniſh, doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Him from doing the like, by way of <hi>Prevention, Concurrence,</hi> or <hi>Evocation,</hi> even in the ſame point which he hath given in charge by a delegated Power; for they who give Authority by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, do always retain more than
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93433:265"/>
they grant: Neither of the two Houſes claim an <hi>Infallibility</hi> of not <hi>Erring,</hi> no more than a General Council can. It is not impoſſible but that the greateſt may be in Fault, or at leaſt intereſted or engaged in the <hi>Delinquency</hi> of one <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Member.</hi> In ſuch Caſes it is moſt proper for the Head to correct, and not to expect the <hi>Conſent</hi> of the <hi>Members,</hi> or for the Parties peccant to be their own Judges. Nor is it needful to confine the King, in ſuch Caſes, within the Circle of any one Court of Juſtice, who is Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Judg in all Courts. And in rare and new Caſes, rare and new Remedies muſt be ſought out; for it is a <hi>Rule</hi> of the <hi>Common Law, In novo Caſu, novum Remedium eſt apponendum:</hi> and the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſt.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 24. giveth <hi>Power,</hi> even to the <hi>Clarks</hi> of the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,</hi> to make <hi>New Forms</hi> of <hi>Writs</hi> in <hi>New Caſes,</hi> leſt any Man that came to the <hi>King's Court of Chancery</hi> for help, ſhould be ſent away without <hi>Remedy:</hi> A <hi>Preſident</hi> cannot be found in <hi>every Caſe</hi>; and of things that happen ſeldom, and are not common, there cannot be a <hi>Common Cuſtom.</hi> Though <hi>Crimes Exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant</hi> do poſe the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:93433:266"/>
a <hi>Preſident</hi> for a <hi>Condigne Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> yet they muſt not therefore paſs unpuniſhed.</p>
                     <p>I have not heard that the People, by whoſe Voices the Knights and Burgeſſes are choſen, did ever call to an account thoſe whom they had Elected; they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give them Inſtructions or Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons what to ſay, or what to do in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, therefore they cannot puniſh them when they come home for doing amiſs: If the People had any ſuch Power over their Burgeſſes, then we might call it, The Natural Liberty of the People, with a miſchief. But they are ſo far from puniſhing, that they may be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves for intermedling with Parliamentary Buſineſs; they muſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chuſe, and truſt thoſe whom they chuſe to do what they liſt; and that is as much liberty as many of us deſerve, for our irregular Elections of Burgeſſes.</p>
                     <p n="15">(15) A fourth point to be conſider'd, is, That in Parliament all Statutes or Laws are made properly by the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, at the Rogation of the People, as His Majeſty King <hi>James,</hi> of happy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93433:266"/>
affirms in his true Law of free Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; and as <hi>Hooker</hi> teacheth us, <hi>That Laws do not take their conſtraining force from the Quality of ſuch as deviſe them, but from the Power that doth give them the Strength of Laws: Le Roy le Veult,</hi> the King will have it ſo, is the Interpretive Phraſe pronounced at the King's paſſing of every Act of Parliament: And it was the ancient Cuſtom for a long time, till the days of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, that the Kings, when any Bill was brought unto them that had paſſed both Houſes, to take and pick out what they liked not, and ſo much as they choſe, was enacted for a Law: but the Cuſtom of the later Kings hath been ſo gracious, as to allow always of the entire Bill as it hath paſſed both Houſes.</p>
                     <p n="16">(16.) The <hi>Parliament</hi> is the King's Court, for ſo all the oldeſt Statutes call it, the King in <hi>His Parliament:</hi> But neither of the two Houſes are that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Court, nor yet both of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; they are only Members, and a part of the Body, whereof the King is the Head and Ruler. The King's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning of this Body of the <hi>Parliament</hi>
                        <pb n="128" facs="tcp:93433:267"/>
we may find moſt ſignificantly proved both by the Statutes themſelves, as alſo by ſuch <hi>Preſidents</hi> as expreſly ſhew us, how the King, ſometimes by himſelf, ſometimes by his Council, and other-times by his Judges, hath over-ruled and directed the Judgments of the Houſes of <hi>Parliament:</hi> for the King, we find that <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the <hi>Charter</hi> of <hi>Forreſts,</hi> and many other Statutes about thoſe times, had only the Form of the Kings Letters-Patents, or Grants under the Great Seal, teſtifying thoſe <hi>Great Liberties</hi> to be the ſole Act and Bounty of the King: The words of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> begin thus; <hi>Henry, by the Grace of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>To all our Arch-Biſhops,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and Our Faithful Subjects Greeting: Know ye, that We, of Our meer free-Will, have granted to all Free-men theſe Liberties.</hi> In the ſame ſtyle goeth the <hi>Charter</hi> of <hi>Forreſts,</hi> and other Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes. <hi>Statutum Hiberniae,</hi> made at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> 9. <hi>Februarii</hi> 14. <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. is but a Letter of the King to <hi>Gerrard,</hi> Son of <hi>Maurice,</hi> Juſtice of <hi>Ireland.</hi> The Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute <hi>de anno Biſſextili</hi> begins thus, <hi>The King to His Juſtices of the Bench, Greet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Explanationes Statuti Gloceſtriae,</hi>

It ſeems Origanally the difference was not great between a <hi>Proclamation</hi> and a <hi>Statute</hi>; this latter the King made by <hi>Common Council</hi> of the Kingdom. In the former he had but the advice only of his great Council of the <hi>Peers,</hi> or of his Privy Council only. For that the King had a great Council, beſides his Parliament, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by a Record of 5. <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. about
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:93433:268"/>
an Exchange between the <hi>King</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Northumberland:</hi> Whereby the <hi>King</hi> promiſeth to deliver to the <hi>Earl</hi> Lands to the value, by the Advice of Parliament, or otherwiſe by the Advice of his Grand Council, and other Eſtates of the Realm, which the KING will aſſemble, in caſe the Parliament do not meet.</p>
                     <p>We may find what Judgment in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times Parliaments have had of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, by the Statute of 31. of <hi>Hen. cap.</hi> 8. in theſe words: <hi>Foraſmuch as the King, by the Advice of his Council, hath ſet forth Proclamations, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Perſons have contemned; not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what a King by his Royal Power may do: Conſidering that ſudden Cauſes and Occaſions fortune many times, which do require ſpeedy Remedies, and that by abiding for a Parliament, in the mean time might happen great Prejudice to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue to the Realm: And weighing alſo, that his Majeſty, which by the Kingly and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Power given him by God, may do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things in ſuch Caſes, ſhould not be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to extend the Liberties, and Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of his Regal Power and Dignity, by
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93433:269"/>
willfulneſs of froward Subjcts: It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought fit, that the King with the Advice of his Honourable Council ſhould ſet forth Proclamations for the good of the People, and defence of his Royal Dignity, as neceſſity ſhall require.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Opinion of a Houſe of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was confirmed afterwards by a ſecond Parliament, and the Statute made <hi>Proclamations</hi> of as great Validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as if they had been made in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> This Law continued until the Government of the State came to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Protector, during the Minority of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, and in his firſt Year it was Repealed.</p>
                     <p>I find alſo, that a <hi>Parliament</hi> in the 11th Year of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, did ſo great Reverence to the Actions, or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the King, that by Statute they provided a Remedy or Means to levy a <hi>Benevolence</hi> granted to the King, although by a Statute made not long before all Benevolences were Damned and Annulled for ever.</p>

In the laſt place, we may conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how much hath been attributed to the Opinions of the <hi>Kings Judges</hi> by Parliaments, and ſo find, that the <hi>King's Council</hi> hath guided and ruled the <hi>Judges,</hi> and the <hi>Judges</hi> guided the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Parliament</hi> of 28 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. The Commons made Suit, <hi>That</hi> William de la Poole, <hi>D. of</hi> Suffolk, <hi>ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Priſon, for many Treaſons and other Crimes. The Lords of the Higher Houſe were doubtful what Anſwer to give, the Opinion of the Judges was demanded. Their Opinion was, that he ought not to be committed, for that the Commons did not charge him with any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Offence, but with General Reports and Slanders.</hi> This Opinion was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
                     <p>In another Parliament, 31. <hi>Hen.</hi> 6.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:93433:273"/>
Opinion of the <hi>Judges,</hi> whether he might be delivered out of Priſon by Privilege of Parliament? upon the Judges An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it was concluded, <hi>That the Speaker ſhould ſtill remain in Priſon, according to the Law, notwithſtanding the Privilege of Parliament, and that he was the Speaker.</hi> Which Reſolution was declared to the Commons by <hi>Moyle,</hi> the King's Serjeant at Law; and the Commons were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the King's Name, by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> (in the abſence of the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> then Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour) to chuſe another Speaker.</p>
