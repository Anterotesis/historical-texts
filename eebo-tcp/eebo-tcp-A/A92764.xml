            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe directions follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which teach how to make a wiſe and godly choyce of a meet yoak-fellow in marriage, were put into my hands by a neere friend of the Author, to conſider whether they were fit to be made publick, and to give my judgment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>I was very much taken with the ſoundneſſe, plainneſſe, cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, fulnes, &amp; good compoſure of them, and doe judge that they may be of excellent uſe to put
<pb facs="tcp:150270:10"/>
ſingle perſons into Gods way, the only right way of entring into the honorable eſtate of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, a matter of greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence concerning Mans weal or woe in this life, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it is well or ill done.</p>
            <p>The compoſer of theſe choyce Rules or Directions, was a moſt ingenious and holy young man, of good learning &amp; rare parts, he ſtudied before hand, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed theſe Rules, which he had gathered out of the Oracles of God; and he had God going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him: for he gave him a wife according to his deſire, with whom he lived but a ſhort time, it pleaſing the Lord (in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to him to take him away from the evil to come.</p>

               <hi>The memory of the juſt</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 10.</note> 
               <hi>is bleſſed:</hi> Some erect mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
<pb facs="tcp:150270:10"/>
in Marble, that their name may be kept in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall remembrance: And it was the manner in ſome places, that in their mourning for their dead friends, they held forth and <hi>ſhewed</hi> ſome of their<note place="margin">Act. 9. 39.</note> moſt excellent works which they wrought while they lived.</p>
            <p>I think a better monument cannot bee raiſed, nor better means can be uſed to preſerve this mans name, moſt pretious, ſweet, and ever living, and moſt profitable to poſterity, then by making this his work publick to the Churches of God.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſuch as will alike ſerve to direct a ſingle woman in her acceptance, and choyce of an husband, &amp; to teach parents how to make choyce of husbands and wives for their children,
<pb facs="tcp:150270:11"/>
as well as to direct a man to make a good choyce of a wife.</p>
            <p>I commend unto all the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of this our brother for their imitation, that every one ſtudy and endevour to know and to do the works and duties of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and conditions wherin God hath ſet them, that they may walk with God, and pleaſe him therein.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the ſecondary evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of being in ſtate of grace, and accepted with God, I know none more clear and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain then this, that a Believer in Chriſt Jeſus doe adde unto his faith a conſcionable care to pleaſe God in the well doing the work of his particular calling and relation.</p>
            <p>I cannot think that a man hath any more power of godlines,
<pb facs="tcp:150270:11"/>
then as he ſhall reſpectively en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour to manifeſt it in the particular calling &amp; condition of life wherein God hath placed him, as well as in his generall.</p>
            <p>For an upright man, as he will (as <hi>David</hi> did) keep himſelf from <hi>his iniquity,</hi> that is, the<note place="margin">Pſal. 18. 23.</note> iniquity which through his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall corruption he was moſt prone unto, &amp; to which through the particular condition of his life, he was moſt tempted and in greateſt danger, ſo his ſpeciall care will be to doe the duty of his own place, to do that work which God in ſpeciall hath given him<note place="margin">Joh. 17. 4.</note> to doe.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle, in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, after he had delivered the doctrine of faith, he ſubjoyneth the doctrine of good works. Firſt, more generally, as the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb facs="tcp:150270:12"/>
and evidences of a lively faith, and then he deſcendeth to particular duties of men and women, according to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ranks and relations, as of <hi>Wives</hi> to their <hi>Husbands,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 22.</note> &amp; <hi>Husbands</hi> to their <hi>Wives,</hi> of <hi>Children</hi> to <hi>Parents,</hi> and<note place="margin">Col. 3. 18.</note> of <hi>Parents</hi> to their <hi>Children,</hi> of <hi>Servants</hi> to their <hi>Maſters,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 2. 17.</note> and of <hi>Maſters</hi> to their <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> as the effects and eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of true ſanctity.</p>
            <p>Where a generall good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is not endevoured, there faith is not alive, but <hi>dead,</hi> and if a man think he<note place="margin">Jam. 2. 17.</note> hath faith, and hath not works, he deceiveth himſelfe: ſo if he think he hath works, becauſe he doth many of the works of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and righteouſneſſe, which his generall calling to Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
<pb facs="tcp:150270:12"/>
leadeth him unto, but yet doth not the work, which God particularly hath given him to doe, he alſo deceiveth himſelfe, &amp; he may fear that the holines and righteouſnes which he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to have, is not ſound.</p>
            <p>Whoſoever ſhall bee deſirous to make uſe of theſe Directions, to make a good entrance into marriage, will, I thinke, be as deſirous to know how to live, as becommeth Chriſtians when they are maried. Wherefore for their help I have added unto the end of theſe directions, ſome others touching Husbands and wives, their loving and living together, ſo as they may pleaſe God, and may live comfortably and happily in the married condition.</p>
            <p>Both theſe directions I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend

to all that deſire infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation herein, and alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you, and theſe to be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to you, by God, the inſtituter of the ordinance of marriage, to whom be aſcribed, as moſt due is, all honour and glory now and for ever.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Very end hath its proper way and means appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to it. All ways will not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually alike lead to the ſame end; there is a contrary way that will never bring thee to it. There is a croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and indirect way, that may perhaps, but with much trouble and labour; but then there is a ſtreight and direct way, and this is that way, which will both with eaſe and pleaſure, bring
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:150270:14"/>
thee to thy deſired end. This is the way which all men grope after, but few can find it.</p>
            <p>Now if to marry, and to marry in the Lord, a wife and a good wife, one with whom thou mayſt begin thy dayes with joy, continue them in quiet, and end them with comfort, if this be the end of thy thoughts, then ſurely the moſt direct and ſtreight way to obtain it, will be to ſeek her of God. Not a few are the inducements to move us to this courſe.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe hee is beſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to guide and direct you to the finding of her; ſhe is a flower that growes not in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very garden, an hearb that is not in every field, ſhe is not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:150270:14"/>
to be found in every houſe; you may ſeek long enough ere you find, and finding be deceived, unleſſe God direct you.</p>
            <p>2. She cannot be had from any other but from him, he it is, who is the great Patron, in whoſe family are all the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, wiſe, vertuous, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons that are to be deſired; and if thou wouldeſt have one of theſe, apply thy ſelf to obtain his favour, ſo ſhalt thou find a good wife, <hi>Pro.</hi> 18. 22. In other fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies<note place="margin">Pro. 18. 22.</note> no doubt thou mayſt find a rich wife, a beautifull wife, but a prudent wife is<note place="margin">Pro. 19. 14.</note> from the Lord, <hi>Pro.</hi> 19. 14.</p>
            <p>3. It is the eaſieſt way to find her. Mercies (though great) yet when they cannot
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:150270:15"/>
but with great difficulty be obtained, it either diſhear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens us in the purſuit of them, or els abates the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the enjoyment of them; but with how much content and delight is the heart filled when it appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth a great mercy, tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling into his lap? Wouldſt thou obtain a good wife, (which of temporall mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies is the greateſt) lo, this is the moſt compendious way: ſit thou ſtill, doe but ſeek and wait, and at length thou ſhalt as it were behold God bringing her in his hand, and offering her to thee: we ſee <hi>Adam</hi> ſlept while God brought <hi>Eve</hi> unto him,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 21</note> 
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 21.</p>
            <p>4. Never any found, that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:150270:15"/>
did not thus ſeek; many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed have wandred &amp; roved over this wide world, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in every place, caſting their eyes in every corner, through Citie &amp; Country, Town and Village, but after the moſt diligent ſcrutinie, what have they at length found? Peradventure riches. Alas! that's vaniſhing. It may be, honour, that's a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; perchance beauty, that's vanity, at the beſt; or civility, &amp; that is but guilded impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; yea, ſhould they at length ſtumble on a good wife, yet if not thus ſought, they ſhall either not long enjoy her, or elſe not ſo comfortably, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of many bitter ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients which God will caſt into it, which otherwiſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:150270:16"/>
might have been a ſweet por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>5. Otherwiſe in ſtead of finding a bleſſing, thou mayſt find a curſe; what greater bleſſing then to enjoy a meet help, one who may rejoyce thy heart in this thy pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, one who may accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany thee, and cheer thee up in the way, when thou art treading many a weary ſtep to the land of reſt? But on the contrary, what heavier curſe canſt thou groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to what ſoarer vexation canſt thou be yoak't to, then to an unequall yoak-fellow? It is that which wil imbitter all thy comforts, bereave thee of all thy delights, rob thee of all thy contentments, yea make thy life weariſome,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:150270:16"/>
and death uncomfortable.</p>
            <p>6. Hence it is, that they who otherwiſe ſeek, inherit ſo much anxiety and trouble in their ſeeking, who in ſtead of imploring Gods aid and aſſiſtance, imploy their owne wits in contriving how to accompliſh their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires: and if their ends faile, and their expectations are croſſed, how are they diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed with the thought of it, their ſpirits being dull and ſtupid, their minds altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſt in that which they deſire to find, conſume and weare out all their comfort and content in the purſuit of that which now they become uncapable to attain: being bereaved of themſelves, their comforts, and peradventure
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:150270:17"/>
their wits all at once: ſo at length make themſelvs fitter for <hi>Bedlam</hi> then the mariage bed; when as on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, thoſe who ſet themſelves to ſeek her of God, enjoy much pleaſure and quiet in ſeeking, contentment in fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and comfort in the poſſeſſing.</p>
            <p>7. Hereby ſhalt thou yeeld unto him due obeiſance, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging him to be thy ſupream governour, going to him as children to the Parent, for guidance and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in all their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires; a thing well-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto him. But if on the contrary, we will ruſh into ſuch weighty buſineſſes, and venture our ſelves upon things of ſo great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:150270:17"/>
without acquainting him with it, or ſeeking to him for it, or imploring his aid and aſſiſtance for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing of it: what is it but to pluck our neckes from his yoak, caſting off all obedience and ſubjection to him, as if wee had no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on him; and therefore would ſlight all direction from him?</p>
            <p>8. Then laſtly how ever it fal out, thou mayſt find com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in it: Bee ſhe vertuous or vicious; if vertuous, then comfort will flow in, on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſide; great comfort wil redound to thee, that God was graciouſly pleaſed to bend his eare unto thee, and give thee ſo favourable a pledge of his loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:150270:18"/>
Every time thou caſts thine eye upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> rejoicing caſt up thine eyes to God, and ſay, Lo, this is the wife that thou haſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me, and bleſſe him in that thou haſt ſo goodly an heritage. If vitious, yet if thou haſt the inward teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of thy conſcience, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thee witneſſe, that thou didſt ſincerely commit thy way unto the Lord, and roll thy ſelfe upon him for dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in it: Lo here thou mayſt aſſuredly take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that all ſhall be for thy good: he who brought thee to this condition, ſhall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port thee in it; he wil either lighten the weight of thy burden, or ſtrengthen the weakneſſe of thy ſhoulders.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:150270:18"/>
But now if this web of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hath been of thine owne weaving, if by thine own neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence thou haſt been much wanting in thy duty to God, and by indirect meanes haſt haled this croſſe upon thee, and God not caſt it on thee, then lay thy hand upon thy mouth, patiently ſubmit, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is fitter for thee then comfort.</p>
            <p>Now, who wil not but eaſily be convinced, that no courſe is like this, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement of a good wife? It were well if our hearts could as eaſily be brought to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the practice of it, as our minds brought to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the truth of it.</p>
            <p>But here it may be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, how or in what manner
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:150270:19"/>
muſt God be ſought, and dealt withall, by thoſe who deſire this bleſſing?</p>
            <p>The only way as for this, ſo for all other mercies, is prayer; a means, under which may well be written, <hi>Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſt:</hi> for ſeldome any who diligently applied themſelvs to this way, ever failed of their end; therefore let it be your ſtudy in the beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner you are able, to direct your ſupplications to him to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>1. That he would give you wiſdome and underſtanding in your choyce (for only the wiſe in choice ſeale to their joyes) that when any one is preſented to your view, that your heart might not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken either with their beauty
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:150270:19"/>
or riches, or naturall endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo as to be careleſſe and negligent in ſeeking and ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching after that, which is the main: That grace in her heart may be the only orient pearle that ſhines ſo bright in your eyes. Had we indeed nothing but a corporal ſubſtance, then beauty, riches, honour, and the like, might be chiefly deſired &amp; moſt ſought after, as things moſt agreeable and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto ſenſe: but we are endowed with a moſt noble ſoule, too high born to feed on ſuch husks; all theſe will afford no more reliſh, then the white of an egge. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore other dainties muſt be provided, other qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons muſt be ſought for, which may be more ſutable to this
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:150270:20"/>
noble faculty: And what can that be but grace? that alone is the dainties with which the ſoule thrives: ſhall therefore the chiefeſt of our deſires, and the greateſt of our ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours be laid out for that which will nouriſh the body, but poyſon the ſoule; which will feed the ſlave, but ſtarve the child? God forbid: yet thus many doe, and thus ſhall we do if God withdraw from us his wiſedome, and deliver us up to our owne folly.</p>
            <p>2. Again, beg of God, that he would never knit thy affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to any whoſe affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he hath not knit to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; that thy love might ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſincere to them, whoſe love is not ſincere to God. And becauſe we many times
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:150270:20"/>
ſee that there may be a rotten karkaſſe under a faire Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and deadly poyſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſmooth skin, that there may be gall and bitterneſſe in their hearts, whoſe mouthes drop as the hony, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny comb: that there may be loathſome hypocriſie under the faire ſhewes of ſincerity: And becauſe God alone ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the heart, and trieth the reines, we can judge only by outward appearance: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſire of him, that he would ſearch and try them; and ſee if there be any way of iniquity found in them, and diſcover it to you, that ſo your affections might not be as ſome mens eyes, led aſtray with falſe fire.</p>
            <p>3. Now if upon diſcovery
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:150270:21"/>
it evidently appeares, that as yet the truth of grace is not wrought in her heart: then earneſtly beg of God, that he would withdraw thy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and take away the edge of them: for it is to be queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, whether thy heart be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely gracious, if thy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons can be ſincere to them which are graceleſs. Fling not the reins of thy love upon the neck of thy affections, but beg of God that he who ſubdueth all things to himſelfe, would ſubdue thy affections, &amp; bring them into ſubjection to his will, that they might be like the Captains ſervant, to goe and come at his pleaſure.</p>
            <p>4. But now if thou haſt ſo far ingaged thy ſelf, that it is neither able nor lawfull for
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:150270:21"/>
thee to withdraw thy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and yet canſt not evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive that there is truth of grace in her heart, then double thy requeſts before God, pray, and pray ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, that he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on her his diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercies, that he would implant the ſeeds of ſaving grace in her heart, and make them to appeare in her life; give not over night or day; give not ſleep to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thy eye lids, till thou haſt obtained this for her; what fellowſhip hath light with darkneſs, or Chriſt with Belial? yea enlarge thy requeſts unto God, that he would firſt unite her unto Chriſt, before he joynes her unto thee: that he would firſt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:150270:22"/>
marry her unto his Son, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he marries her unto thee; that he would make her one with him, before he make her one with thee; that he would make you members of one head, before he make you one body; that yee might be both one ſpirit, before ye are one fleſh; that he would firſt joyn your hearts, and then joyne your hands.</p>
            <p>5. Now if by diligent ſearch it doth manifeſtly appeare, that God hath done more then ordinarily for her ſoule, that there are the impreſſions of a new creature ſtampt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, and that the pangs of the new birth are over, then the chiefe, but yet not all thy work is done: thou mayſt not preſently ſit down and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:150270:22"/>
conclude, <hi>This is a wife for me and I will be an husband for her.</hi> No, there is yet a further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry to be made: for as thou mayſt not make choice of any who is not godly, ſo neither mayſt thou chuſe of every one that is; ſhe may be good, yet not good for thee, ſhe may be a fit wife, yet not fit for thee. Further therefore inlarge thy requeſts, that <hi>God</hi> would provide for thee not only a good wife, but a meet wife, meet in every reſpect.</p>
            <p>1. In regard of age, a green head will not ſuit with gray haires, neither do we uſually graft young plants upon old ſtocks: to ſee youth joyn'd to age, is a thing no leſſe ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to others, then incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous in it ſelf; ſuch matches
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:150270:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
never pleaſe any but the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; yea and them but for a while.</p>
            <p>2. A meetneſſe not only in regard of age, but parentage would be convenient: let birds of a feather flock toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>pares cum paribus.</hi> The Eagle will not joyn herſelfe with a Sparrow, neither is it fit for an Aſſe to aſſociate with a Lion, they ſeldome joyne without confuſion, which is commonly the event of ſuch unequall matches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing begun with the diſcord of parents, and end for the moſt part in the diſſention of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>3. Seek a meetneſſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of eſtate in ſome equall proportion*; though meanes ought not chiefly to be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:150270:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſought, ſo neither altogether to be neglected.</p>
            <p>1. Marry not one that hath nought, leſt ſhe be ſet at nought by thee, or by thy friends. <hi>Rachel</hi> was not ſo much deſpiſed for her barren womb, as many now are for their barren purſe.</p>
            <p>2. Againe, ſeeke not one whoſe eſtate doth far ſurpaſſe<note place="margin">Jer. 45. 5.</note> thine, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 45. 5. *Indeed if God by his providence caſt ſuch an one upon thee, thou mayſt embrace it; but it is one thing to ſeek it, and another thing to have it caſt upon thee. But this is the Haven which moſt men deſire, and here lieth the rock on which many men are ſplit. Some are ſo deſirous of riches, that no competent portion will ſerve
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:150270:24"/>
their turne, but having many large proffers, yet remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied, and ſo while they covet all, at length perhaps loſe all; ſo that there is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in ſeeking, what is there then in finding a wife richly laden? Surely that ſaying is true: <hi>Non videmus idmanticae quod in tergo eſt,</hi> we ſee not that part of the wallet that is behind, we view the fore-part of her wallet laden w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> wealth, and there we fix our eyes, without either care or deſire to looke further: But had we wiſedome to caſt our eyes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that part, which is behind, we ſhould behold it fil'd with ſorrow and trouble in full meaſure, thruſt downe, heapt up; yea, if not running over. How many inconveniences
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:150270:24"/>
attend ſuch marriages, they beſt know who feele the weight of them, and groan under the burden of them; yet ſome there are, whi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and daily experience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us of; as firſt, thou doſt incur the danger of loſing all thy right of reſpect that's due unto thee, who in ſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verencing thee, will diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect thee, in ſtead of making thee her head, will ſet thee at her feet: and becauſe in riches ſhe weighes moſt, therefore ſhe will look in authority to ſway moſt: ſhe whoſe deſire ſhould be to thee, now thine muſt be to her; and becauſe ſhe hath brought thee thy eſtate, therefore will ſhe take upon her, without control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to conſume thy eſtate.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:150270:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And if by words or actions thou any way ſhew thy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, thou ſhalt ſoon find it, to the loſſe of thy peace, and the increaſe of thy daily trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and vexation: yea, to an higher pitch will this flame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, if there be not grace to qualifie it.</p>
            <p>3. There ſhould be a reſpect had to her conſtitution, and diſpoſition; two paſſionate natures will not well agree: much like the meeting of two mill-ſtones, when there is no corn between, it enda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers the firing of the whole Mill: litle peace and great trouble is the portion of that family where ſuch meet. Neither will two melancholy bodies ſute well; when any croſſe or trouble befalls them, how will they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:150270:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be able to bear one anothers burden, or comfort one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when as melancholy, the nouriſher of grief, is as much predominant in the one as in the other?</p>
            <p>By this then it may plainly appeare, that it is a buſineſſe of great importance; wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is not more neceſſarie and beneficial, neither is raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe more obnoxious in any thing then in this: *For being once done, it cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. Why is it, that every corner almoſt ecchoes with theſe or the like complaints? One will ſay, I would I had never ſeen thy face; another will ſay, I never enjoyed mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day ſince I knew thee; a third, I would I were unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried again. Some bewailing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:150270:26"/>
their condition with teares, others railing with oathes, and a third raging with cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: All which is nothing elſe but the fruit of an indiſcreet and unadviſed brain, which leapt before they lookt, and ſo run headlong upon their own ruine.</p>
            <p>But now if by thy diligent prayers God hath been ſo gracious to thee, as to bring to thy view, and to thy prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, one endowed with all thoſe qualifications before mentioned, and ſo every way fit for thee, yet before thou ſetleſt thy ſelfe to wooe her, wooe both thy friends and her friends, labour to obtaine their free wil and conſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; you know the proverb, <hi>Stoln goods will not proſper,</hi> if
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:150270:26"/>
thou takeſt her, without her friends conſent, ſhee's no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then ſtoln, for thou vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently takeſt from them, that which they doe not willingly give thee: and how canſt thou expect a bleſſing ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company this thieviſh match? Again, if thou giveſt thy ſelf to her, without thy friends conſent, thou robbeſt them of their priviledge, and becom'ſt thine own carver, a thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the rules of reaſon, and Gods word. Againſt the rules of reaſon: for what more reaſonable then for a man to diſpoſe of his owne, and what more his own then his children? They are the parents right, they brought them into the world, they came out of their own loyns,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:150270:27"/>
and were bred up at their own breaſts; they have ſuffered much, and done much for them: How many ſick ſits, and weak faintings were they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to in their conception? How many terrible pangs and painfull dolours did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company their production? With what diligent care and fervent pains, and frequent coſt were they at for their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation? How many a wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful night, and weariſome reſt, and tedious thoughts, and dolefull teares, and earneſt prayers, have they poured out for them? Let not him be worthy the name of a child, who having received thus much from their parents, will not with all poſſible ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on acknowledge it. And what
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:150270:27"/>
better teſtimony of thy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement canſt thou give, then in this, to ſubmit thy ſelfe to him, who (under God) hath been the cauſe of thy being, and ſo earneſtly ſeeks after thy well-being? It is a part of the parents duty ſeaſonably and carefully to provide in this kind for their children. Thus did <hi>Abraham</hi> for his ſon <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 24. 2. 3.<note place="margin">Gen. 24. 2. 3.</note> And <hi>Iſaac</hi> for his ſon <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 28. 12. And <hi>Hagar</hi> for<note place="margin">Gen. 28. 12. Gen. 21. 21.</note> her ſonne <hi>Iſmael, Gen.</hi> 21. 21. And as the ſons, ſo the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were at the parents diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, therefore ſaith <hi>Caleb, I will give thee Achſah my daughter to wife, Joſh.</hi> 15. 17.<note place="margin">Joſ. 15. 17. 1 Sam. 18. 27.</note> And <hi>Saul</hi> gave <hi>David Michol</hi> his daughter to wife, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 27. yea <hi>Naomi</hi> was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:150270:28"/>
to provide for <hi>Ruth,</hi> her daughter in law, <hi>Ruth</hi> 1. 2.<note place="margin">Ruth. 1. 2.</note> And is it not then the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens duty to ſubmit to their parents providing? Yea ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for ſo did <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 28.<note place="margin">Gen. 28. 6, 7.</note> 6, 7. Nay, it is obſervable, that the parents conſent amongſt the heathen, is a thing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in marriage, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34. 4.<note place="margin">Gen. 34 4.</note> Therefore ſaid <hi>Shechem</hi> to his father <hi>Hamar, Get me this maid to wife,</hi> implying that unleſſe his Father would get her, he could not take her. And what doe they but heap up woe to themſelves, and ſorrow and griefe upon the gray haires of their aged pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who do otherwiſe? <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. 34, 35. Therefore ſeeing<note place="margin">Gen. 26. 34, 35.</note> it is the Parents duty to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, and thine to ſubmit, beg
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:150270:28"/>
of God that he would direct the hearts of thy parents to pitch upon one who may be every way qualified and meet for thee, as before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that their hearts may not be ſo carried away with ſome particular object, at which they look moſt, and like beſt, be it beauty or honour, or friends, or riches, or the like: (for with theſe many are ſo taken, that if they ſee theſe attend her, be there elſe never ſo much unfitneſs and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity, yet they are reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, none but ſhe ſhall have their conſent,) but that their affections might be taken moſt with that which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves it beſt: and then deſire that thy affections may be pliable to his, that he would
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:150270:29"/>
bring them into a ſubmiſſive frame; and not like ſome whoſe affections having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken an head, run themſelves upon this deſperate reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that what ever become of it, they are reſolved, fall back or fall edge, like or diſlike, none ſhall ſtop them, none ſhall hinder them; certainly where ſuch unbridled reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions meet in either, it plainly argues that <hi>God</hi> was ſought of neither; neither of the parent for the child, nor of the child for himſelfe. But ſurely this is the fruit of prayer, and here is the finger of God, when the thoughts, intentions, and affections of both ſweetly and harmoniouſly meet, and conjoyne in one. The buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up of this match will be
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:150270:29"/>
like the building up of the Temple, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. 7. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was heard neither the voyce of the Hammer or the axe: ſo here all things ſhall come forward ſo proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly and ſo eaſily, that there ſhall not need an hammer to drive them, and all obſtacles ſhall be ſo diſſolved, that there ſhall be no need of an Axe to hew them aſunder.</p>
            <p>Now having ſucceſſively wooed thy parents, then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to obtain the good will of the party; but firſt be ſure ſhe be one to whom thy affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions can be entirely knit. Let no riches entice thee, nor beauty allure thee, nor friends perſwade thee, no nor grace move thee to make any thy wife, where thou doſt not find
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:150270:30"/>
thine affections equally drawing thee to it: for where entire love begins not the match, there jarring diſcords for the moſt part will end it. Firſt, be ſure that thy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are on her; and then la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to get her affections un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee: This mutuall love is the foundation on which this marriage ſtructure muſt be built, and the pillars which muſt continually ſupport it. Indeed it is the very kernell of the buſineſſe; he who will attempt it without this, muſt expect that it cannot ſtand firm, but will ere long ſhatter about his eares.</p>
            <p>And as thy care muſt be to get her good will, ſo how thou getteſt it: for herein many bewray abundance of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:150270:30"/>
weakneſſe, and a bundle of folly.</p>
            <p>1. Some will declare their kindred, from what a noble ſtock they are derived, how nobly deſcended, what royall blood runs in their veines: Thus they ſeek by honour to win their wives.</p>
            <p>2. Others will unlock their Treaſuries, lay open their riches, ſpread before them their revenues, declare unto them the length and breadth of their poſſeſſions, with large proffers and promiſes, that the quinteſſence of them all ſhall be extracted for their uſe and ſervice. Thus riches ſhall be a net to entrap their affections.</p>
            <p>3. Some will acquaint them what large priviledges they
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:150270:31"/>
ſhall obtain, what liberty they ſhall enjoy, what ever is in the houſe, or in the field, or in the purſe, ſhall be at their diſpoſing, that without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollment they ſhall come and goe, walk and ride at their own pleaſure. Theſe pretend liberty, but intend to bind them ſure to themſelvs.</p>
            <p>4. Others there be who will ſpend their time and ſtudies in frequenting the Muſes, that ſo by their aid they may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome curious Poems, &amp; Anagrams, deckt with many quaint expreſſions, and faw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning flatteries, thinking by theſe to raviſh the affections of their ſilly ſweet-hearts.</p>
            <p>5. Some againe will ſeek to win their affections not with words, but actions, they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:150270:31"/>
will heap on them, many rare preſents, and preſent them with many gifts, and give them many tokens, nay how will they ſtrain their purſes, and ſtretch their wits, as it were on the tenters, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive what gifts will be moſt acceptable, and what preſents may be the beſt load-ſtone to draw their affections?</p>
            <p>6. Others there be, who will <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pply themſelves by baſe flatterings and enticings ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with many fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh geſtures, fond &amp; unſeemly carriages, the fruits of a weak brain, and a light behaviour, as if they had to deale with a ſimple child, and not a wiſe maiden.</p>
            <p>7. And if this will not take effect, ſome there be who
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:150270:32"/>
will ſet their helliſh thoughts awork, how to accompliſh, ſo as to have their luſtfull will upon her, thinking that then all will be ſure, as if they had to deale with a proſtitute quean, and not a chaſt Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.</p>
            <p>There are many other wayes and methods, which to the wiſeſt are unknown. The way of a young man with a maid, is one of thoſe foure hidden things, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 19.<note place="margin">Prov. 30. 19.</note> But it is to be feared, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the many wayes that ſo many perſons tread, there are but few that hit upon the right: Surely I ſhould think this courſe beſt: it is moſt ſure and leſſe chargeable, a way wherein abundance of comfort and contentment
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:150270:32"/>
may be brought in, and not any the leaſt expended or laid out: ſeeking in another me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, many ſpend abundance of reſt and contentment, and at length miſſe of their aime, but in this way they ſhall gain abundance of peace and comfort, and ſeldome or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail of their end.</p>
            <p>Goe to God, and earneſtly intreat him, that as he hath afforded thee his aſſiſtance hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, in guiding and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting thee to pitch thy thoughts only on one who is religiouſly and vertuouſly diſpoſed, one who is every way qualified and fitted for thee; and as he hath been gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious unto thee, ſo as to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford thee the free will and conſent of parents, and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:150270:33"/>
all difficulties and rubbs that might lie in the way; that ſo now there is a ſmooth and plain paſſage open for thee to her, and her to thee: deſire him, that as he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, that ſo he would finiſh the work: that he would guide thee and direct thee to pitch upon ſuch a courſe, to obtain her affections, as may be moſt proſperous in it ſelf, and beſt pleaſing to him: Tell him thou knoweſt, that neither thine own nor her affections, are at each others own, but at his diſpoſing; he is able to turne them and wind them as he pleaſeth: therefore i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>treat him to knit and unite your affections one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in an unſep<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rable bond that might never be broken;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:150270:33"/>
in a knot ſo firm, that nothing but death may diſſolve it: and not like ſome, who after their affections have been ſetled, and the match even almoſt concluded, I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by their parents, for ſome triviall buſineſſe, or mony matter; or by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties themſelves for ſome ſmall jarre or prejudice, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained perhaps onely through the aſperſion of ſome, malevolent to their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happineſſe, they have raſhly broke off all, which for the preſent, though they have ſwallowed downe, yet perhaps never throughly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, and ſo it hath bred in them a diſtempered head, a diſquieted mind, and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented heart.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:150270:34"/>Again, tell him, thou doſt not attempt by any indirect wayes of thine owne, or by any unlawfull enterpriſes of others to inſinuate thy ſelfe into her affections, or to draw her affections unto thee, but thou leaveſt it to him: And, as many do, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times make choyce of ſome ſpeciall friend to imploy in this buſineſſe of wooing for them; ſo thou doſt make choyce of him, as thy moſt eſpeciall friend, into whoſe hands thou doſt wholly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thy ſelfe, intruſting him with the whole buſineſſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring him to doe all thy works for thee.</p>
            <p>Now if he ſhould ſeem to put thee off, as not willing to undertake for thee, thou
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:150270:34"/>
mayſt tell him, it is contrary to his practice of old, he was wont to invite his ſervants and children, that when they had any great buſineſſe to do, they ſhould come and caſt the burden of it on him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.<note place="margin">Pſal. 55. 22.</note> 22. Tell him he is immutable, he is God and changeth not, therefore he cannot ſhake thee off. Tell him thou doſt truſt him with it, and preſſe him with his promiſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath ſaid, He will never faile any that put their truſt<note place="margin">Deut. 31. 6.

Tell him thou wilt ſtay his leaſure, and wait upon him, knowing that he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth, maketh not haſt; tell him thou knoweſt that none
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:150270:35"/>
can ſo eaſily unite your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions as he can; if he do but ſpeake the word, it ſhall be done; and if he doe but once unite them, they are united to the purpoſe, nothing ſhall be able to looſe them; neither ſickneſſe nor poverty, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, or perſecution, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, or what ever it be that may ſeparate their bodies, nothing ſhall ſeparate their affections; yea further deſire him, that he would in ſuch a way, and in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner draw your affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſo as you may ſee, it is his hand alone that knits them: ſo ſhalt thou be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to faſten them on her, as on one which he hath provided for you: yea, let him know, that as there are
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:150270:35"/>
many prayers put up unto him, ſo there are many pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers wait upon him; and if hee will ſucceſſively accompliſh the deſires of his people, he ſhall moſt willingly inhabit the praiſes of his people. Surely, whoever doth apply himſelfe in theſe wayes, hee ſhall find them very proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; God doth uſually crowne them with ſucceſſe, thou ſhalt find more then an ordinary providence going along with thee, and doing for thee; yea, it may be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond thy expectation, thou ſhalt ſee and feel ſuch a ſweet conjunction of heart and af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fection, the very contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it will exceedingly pleaſe and delight thee.</p>
            <p>When you or your friend
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:150270:36"/>
for you, do make the motion to her friend or friends, under whoſe power ſhe is, or if (ſhe being in her own power) it be made to her ſelfe, you muſt then deal truly, doe not dare by any means, to circumvent them to gain your deſire, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſeeming to be more religious, or better then you indeed are, or by making your condition, or eſtate, ſeeme better then it is, conceale no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from them, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whereof after marriage, may cauſe griefe unto them; or may give them cauſe to ſay, that you dealt falſly and deceitfully with them.</p>
            <p>9. When you make &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute your ſute to her, be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, free, ingenuous, and diſcreet, with all kindneſſe,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:150270:36"/>
yet doe not pretend more love then indeed you beare unto her.</p>
            <p>10. Now if at laſt God hath anſwered thy praiers, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled thy deſires, and hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee a vertuous wife, hath given thee her friends and thy friends conſent, and hath moſt firmely united your affections in a ſweet and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable bond of love, ſo that now the match is ſtruck, and thou enjoyeſt thy hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; then forget not thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſerious reſolutions, and intentions: Didſt thou not reſolve when thou waſt in the multitude of thy thoughts, entangled in thy affections, ſurpriſed with feares, and doubtfull of thy hopes, that if God would be pleaſed to

quiet thy thoughts, ſettle thy affections, baniſh thy feares, and make ſure thy hopes, that then thou wouldſt with all thankfull acknowledgement, return to him the glory of it. Remember therefore what hath gone out of thy mouth; and as he hath turned thy pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition into fruition; ſo doe thou turn thy reſolution into action, and preſently fall a bleſſing of him.</p>
            <p>1. Bleſs him that ever hee put it into thy heart to fall upon this courſe of ſeeking of him; when as others in all their thoughts, and amidſt the variety of their wayes and contrivances, this is the leaſt, yea, not any of them: To ſeek God in ſuch a matter as this, they think it a thing as
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:150270:37"/>
ridiculous, ſo unproſperous; now that thou ſhouldſt make choyce of this way above all others, which by experience thou haſt found to be the beſt and ſureſt, here is cauſe of bleſſing.</p>
            <p>2. Again, bleſs him, that he hath given thee any wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in chooſing, that hee hath reſtrained thee from hurrying thy affections head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, as many do, without wit or diſcretion, upon any which their rude fancie, and roving eye is caſt upon, giving the reines to their unbridled af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, to run unadviſedly upon any, where they ſee no other excellency, but only that which is in wealth, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, beauty, parts, or the like: as for grace, they deſire it not
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:150270:38"/>
at all; or if they do, only as the over-waight to ſo many pounds of Gold; yea, ſome are ſo beſotted, that where none of theſe are, yet there ſhall their affections be; how then haſt thou cauſe to bleſs God, that he hath given thee ſuch ſpirituall wiſedome, wherewithall to over-maſter thy affections, ſo as they are carryed out only there, where there are better motives to draw them? as for <hi>Beauty, Riches,</hi> and the like, theſe thou deſireſt only as Adjuncts, as the ſhell: <hi>Grace,</hi> that is the ſubſtance, that is the kernell, for which thou takeſt ſo much pains to get, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gotten, takeſt ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in enjoying.</p>
            <p>3. Bleſs him, not only for
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:150270:38"/>
applying thy minde to ſeek a vertuous and gracious mate; but that he hath crowned thy ſeeking with finding, that thou haſt found a <hi>Roſe</hi> among the <hi>Thiſtles</hi> and a <hi>Lilly</hi> among the <hi>Thornes;</hi> that among ſo many thouſands, he hath, as it were, cull'd out one, whoſe gracious and godly diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is every way anſwerable to thy deſire; and whoſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is every way ſutable to thy nature; he hath not dealt ſo with every one, many have ſought, but not found, and few have had their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations anſwered in their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:150270:42"/>1. Do not pleaſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your ſelf, with a miſ-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the married eſtate, promiſing to your ſelf to reap and injoy that good, and (as many will call it) that happineſs, which is not to be found in it.</p>
            <p>2. There is an inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in marriage, as in all other earthly (though lawfull and good) things, to give full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and to ſatisfie your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires: you muſt bring content with you unto it, or you ſhall never find content in it. You muſt firſt be ſo good a ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in Chriſts School, as to have <hi>learned in every eſtate to</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 11.</note> 
               <hi>be content.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Take heed that heat of love do not make you ſo blinde, that you ſee not things
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:150270:42"/>
as they are, nor yet look after, or ſee any thing but what may concern the ſatisfying of your preſent deſires.</p>
            <p>4. How many are there, that when they are in love, ſee nothing but fair, and good, in their <hi>Beloved?</hi> then they can ſee no faults, ſcarce any infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, who, after marriage, when their luſt is a little over, or unſatisfied, or not finding the content they expected, are too quick-ſighted to ſee and finde faults, when there is none, or ſuch only, as wiſe men ſhould have foreſeen, and can eaſily bear &amp; paſs by.</p>
            <p>5. They are alſo ſo wholly taken up with expectation of the preſent delights and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent they ſhall have by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, that they do not at all
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:150270:43"/>
forethink of the many duties, which, when they are married, they muſt doe; nor yet of the cares they muſt take; nor of the evils they are to ſuffer.</p>
            <p>7. All theſe you muſt think of, and prepare for, before that you marry.</p>
            <p>8. God hath in his Word told you, what you muſt doe when you are married, moſt of the particulars I ſhall ſhew you in the enſuing Diſcourſe.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:150270:43"/>10. When ſin entred into the world, it made the whole<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 20</note> Creation <hi>ſubject to vanitie;</hi> it did empty the creature of that ſufficiency which before it had, whereby ſatisfaction and content might have been found in it for all thoſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes for which God had made it.

            <p>11. I write not this to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage any, who have a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to marry; For marriage is an honorable ordinance of God, for excellent ends; as to<note place="margin">Mal. 2. 15.</note>

            <p>12. Such may be a ſingle man or womans conſtitution of body, and condition for their outward eſtate, that the good and comfort of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age may countervaile and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the troubles of it. In ſuch caſes it is beſt to marry; whereas otherwiſe it would be beſt to abſtaine.</p>
            <p>13. The leaſt ſin is worſe and more to be ſhunned, then the greateſt earthly trouble. Touching marrying, or not

marrying, choice is to be made, according as men may <hi>beſt pleaſe God</hi> in either eſtate, and be moſt free from ſin, or (as their condition may be in compariſon) moſt free from <hi>worldly cares and diſtractions.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 32. 35.</note> In ſome caſes, ſome few di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions in the unmarried eſtate, may exceed the many troubles in the married.</p>
            <p>14. Where a wiſe and good choice is made, there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed many benefits and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to be found in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried eſtate; For in many caſes <hi>Two are better then one,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 4. 9, 10, 11, 12.</note> when thoſe two are one in their ſtudies and affections, to doe one another good. Loving and faithful husbands and wives, will one help ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in keeping off, and (if this
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:150270:45"/>
cannot be) in bearing one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers burdens, and will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply each others wants in very many things, both corporall and ſpirituall, and will be ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall helpers of each others joy.</p>
            <p>15. In the married eſtate may be expected the greateſt earthly comforts attainable in this life; yea, much ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all comfort, if the yoak-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes doe truely feare God, and are truely religious and loving one to another, ſo that they apply themſelves to be helpfull, and to doe good, and give all lawfull content unto each other, in all the good offices they owe as huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife, and as heires together of the ſame grace of life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:150270:45"/>16. It ſhall be your wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to be provident and wary how you enter into this eſtate; and that you foreknow, and doe throughly forethink and prepare for abilitie to do the duties, and to beare the troubles which that eſtate wil neceſſarily put you upon, as I hinted before.</p>
            <p>17 I would therefore have unmarried perſons take heed that they deceive not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in expecting more good in the married eſtate, then it hath in it to afford them, leſt (when they are diſappointed of what they expected, nay, when contrary to expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they find much to be done, yea, much evill to be ſuffered which they neither looked, nor prepared for) their lives
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:150270:46"/>
be made comfortable; and as to ſome it doth prove ſo irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and intolerable, that they ſinfully (and too late) repent of that their marriage which they ſo inconſiderably did enter into.</p>
            <p>1. When two meet perſons have acc<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rding to the former directions proceeded, and have gained conſent of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and conſent of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo that they are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to marry one another: it is good that they be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and made ſure one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, by betrothing, before that they be ſolemnly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</p>
            <p>2. This hath been the uſe of Gods people in all ages,<note place="margin">Deut. 20. 7. Deut. 22. 32.</note> both before and ſince the coming of our Saviour: His

               <hi>Mary,</hi> was <hi>betrothed</hi> to <hi>Joſeph.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. This act of betrothing of two meet perſons allowed to marry, is by mutuall pligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their troths, and giving themſelves one to another, to enjoy each other, when they ſhall be ſolemnly married.</p>
            <p>4. This act doth ſo aſſure them one to another, that they cannot (though both ſhould conſent) go back and deſiſt from marriage; yet it doth not give them right of marriage ſociety and due be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence one from another, which is not given untill mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: <hi>Mary</hi> the mother of<note place="margin">Mat. 1. 20.</note> our Saviour, was <hi>Joſeph</hi> her husbands <hi>Wife,</hi> by vertue of the betrothing, but ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a Virgin. <hi>Joſeph</hi> had

no <hi>knowledge of her,</hi> becauſe<note place="margin">Mat. 1. 18. 25.</note> they were not marryed.</p>
            <p>5. This betrothing is of great good uſe; For after that they are betrothed, the mindes of thoſe two are ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, all fears and doubts of breaking off, are removed. They may then not only give leave to their affections, but may heighten and inlarge them, one towards another. Now, they may, and ought to conſider before-hand of their coming together, and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king proviſion for it. And this ſtaying ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the contract and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, will ſhew, that it is not luſt which makes them run headlong into this eſtate, as it is with too many, more like brute Beaſts then reaſonable

The wife, ſhee out of duty, the husband, he out of wiſdome ſhould begin firſt, which when it is done by the one, let not the other dare, but lovingly and readily to entertain it.
