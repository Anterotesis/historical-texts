            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>At the table (after the Dutch faſhion) they ſit long, and drinke hard, and being cloyed with Glaſſes of Sugar and Rheniſh, whoſe poyſon goes downe ſmoothly, they fall againe to their Lauoltaes: and in ths manner doe they for three or foure dayes together, renew good cheere, their carowſing, and their daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.</p>

               <p>At this impiety the fire of Gods indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being kindled, he made the earth to cleaue, and to ſwallow thoſe that deuoured the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of it: her wombe opened like an inſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Graue, and in the ſame were they (All) buryed aliue.</p>

               <p>The Vine (vntimely cut) weepes away her ſtrength at the wound, but no miſery that cuts vs (earely or late) can make vs weepe for our ſinnes.

               <p>To ſet downe our ſinnes, is as infinite a taſke as to paint our thoughts: it is a chaine reaching downe as low beneath vs, as the glories of heauen are aboue vs. To ſet downe our ſinnes at full, we had need to ſtudy a new Arithmeticke: to be as long-liude as the Hart when we ſit to doe it: to turne the Sea into Incke when we write the Figures: to binde vp a Booke with as many Leaues as are rent by Autumne: and to haue the Sands of the Ocean for Compters, yet all theſe helpes are not able to caſt vp the Summe. For we are ſtill at difference with God, yet is he loath to fall out with vs: we owe him Millions, yet pay him not a Mite: He loues vs as the Apple of his Eye, yet we caſt his loue at our feete: he ſings ſweet Notes of mercy in our Eares, and they make vs preſume: he then ſhakes his Iron Mace of Juſtice at vs, and then wee deſpaire. So that his patience and our wickedneſſe, our prouocation and his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hartedneſſe, are no more tunable together then Lute-ſtrings of a Wolfe and a Lambe, which neuer agree in Muſicke.</p>

If a debter owe vs money, we looke to haue all, we ſpare not him, we vexe him, we plucke out his throate for our owne: Why ſhould not God (then) handle vs ſo? Yet he reckons ſeldome, and forgiues much: when he ſees vs waſting the Talents he truſts vs with, and too too lauiſhly conſuming them, then, then, we muſt be ſure to pay for all.</p>
               <p>Euery man hath by himſelfe an accompt to make vp: euery Nation runnes in Arera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, yea, the World it ſelfe is behinde hand with his Lord and Maker. The Audit day is ſet downe in his euerlaſting Reportary, (knowne to man that it muſt come, but knowne to the King of Heauen onely when it ſhall come:) for when eyther we (by our ſelues) perſonally, or any Nation particularly, or the world in generally is to be ſummoned to make his reſt euen, lyes hid in a Booke which none can vnclaſpe. All of vs therefore had neede to be in readines becauſe the hower is vncertaine when he will call.</p>
               <p>How vnſpeakable then is the Mercy of our Sauiour? how indemenſiue is his bounty? that our offences being as innumerable as the torments of hell, and our leaſt deſeruing them

               <p>O my deare Country of <hi>Germany,</hi> this is not the firſt warning that thou haſt had from Heauen to amend thy wickedneſſe.

Leaſt therefore that this thy preſent calamity be but vnto thee as a fearefull dreame, and leaſt thou ſhouldſt write this freſh and bleeding miſery in water, when it is moſt fit to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen in leaues of Adamant, or rather printed in the palmes of thy hands to be euer in thine

Amongſt many therefore of the rods, with which thou haſt beene beaten, I will onely ſhew thee three, and theſe are they.</p>
               <p>In the yeare 1346.

               <p>And againe in the yeare 1356. on the day of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> another Earth-quake did not onely ſhake and ſearch the foundations of all <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> but (for many times one after another) toſſed the foreſaid Citie of <hi>Baſill,</hi> caſting downe her Towers, Churches, Palaces, and Wals, and murdring in their ruines, aboue one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

perſons, and with the fall of ſtones and timber, ſtriking infinite numbers lame. Yet the rage of it was not ſatiſfied thus: for by the ſhaking in pieces of houſes that had fires in them, a lamentable deſtruction fell vpon the whole Citie: inſomuch (the flames being exceeding great, and not able any wayes to be quenched) men, women, and children ſtood afarre off, wringing their hands, to ſee their riches, their dowries, and patrimonies ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp in flames, which burned day and night, and in their greedy and mercileſſe fury conſumed (beſides the Citie of <hi>Baſill</hi>) theſe places alſo: <hi>viz.

               <p>The ſame Authour ſets downe likewiſe, the ſad remembrance of a miſery which fell in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1545. vpon <hi>Mechlyn</hi> in <hi>Brabant,</hi> where God thundred firſt ſo terribly on the buildings and the ſinnes of the people, that <hi>Mechlyn</hi> ſhooke and trembled to her very foundations.

<pb facs="tcp:3262:14"/>
miſery being likewiſe remoued from them, as bad or worſe ſucceeded: for the Clouds ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their reuenging boſomes, threw downe ſuch fearefull Lightning, that men expected when the whole frame of Heauen would haue melted. And (to increaſe that terror) the flaſhes brake into a Tower that was ſtored with eight hundred Barrels of Gun-powder, which taking fire, blew vp a great part of the Tower in a moment: Stones, Timber, and mens quarters flying vp into the Ayre, and many whole carkaſes found dead the next morning. No Church ſtood vndefaced, no houſe vnruined, no man but vndone by it.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time three men ſitting at Cards were ſtrucke dead, whilſt the woman that went into the Cellar to fetch them drinke eſcaped aliue: yet diſmayed no doubt, but not ſo much terrified as he was, who in the heate of thoſe diuine puniſhments, fled and hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in a caue by the ſpace of three dayes: from whence being driuen out by Famine (for no force elſe could haue made him aduenture to the light) he with faint voyce, and trembling ioynts aſked aloud, <hi>If the world ſtood ſtill or not.</hi> Thus <hi>Munſter.</hi>
