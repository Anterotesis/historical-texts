            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SEriouſly to Conſider my great Zeal and Love that I have always had for his late Majeſty and Kingdoms, and my Fervent Conſtancy to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to your Majeſty, as it may appear by many Faſtings that I cannot number, tho ſome particular ones I can, as Fourteen Days and Nights, and Thirteen Days and Nights, and three times Twelve Days and Nights, and Nine Days and Nights, and went to <hi>Windſor</hi> on Foot; and Seven Days and Nights, and Five Days and a Half; and as for Four, Three, and Two Days and Nights I cannot number them: And all my Faſtings, the Almighty bears me Record, they were ſincerely perform'd without the Reliſh or Taſte of any thing in this World: And moreover I have had many Children, and have Nurs'd them all my ſelf, and I have had Three and Four Children Young and no Maid, and none to help me neither in Sickneſs or Health, and yet I have found Opportunity to come to <hi>White-hall</hi>; and God knows the care and pains I have taken for theſe Twenty Years, and yet for all this through the great Love I bear to your Sacred Majeſty and Kingdoms, becauſe I know you are a Gracious Prince, and I long for your eternal and preſent Happineſs and your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms too: Therefore I preſume a Propoſal that may Convince your Majeſty, and Settle your Kingdoms, and fill all your Subjects full of Joy, if your Majeſty would be graciouſly pleaſed to yield to my Propoſal; for your Majeſty knows that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſays, She is the True Church, and therefore ſhe hath the power of Miracles, and I ſay ſhe is not the True Church, and hath not the Power of Miracles, but what ſhe hath done has been by a falſe Power to delude Kings and Princes, and deceive others, which I can plainly demonſtrate it, if your Majeſty ſo pleaſes to favour me, as to grant me my Propoſal which I ſhall propoſe, which undoubtedly will manifeſt the True Church, and your Majeſty knows it was the Glory of <hi>Solomon</hi> to give Judgment between the Two Harlots in reſtoring the Living Child to its own Mother; this was ſuch a piece of Juſtice, that all Men admir'd the Wiſdom of God in <hi>Solomon,</hi> and if it was ſo much Glory and Wiſdom in <hi>Solomon</hi> in giving Judgment between Two Harlots; how much more Glorious will it be for your Majeſty to be as an Angel to give Judgment between theſe Two Churches? for the one ſays I am the True Church, and the other ſays, I am the True Church, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſays to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> She is no True Church but She is a Heretick and Damn*d, and ſo is all that Protects her, and therefore ſhe ſaith, All is mine, and I will have them dead or alive; for you ſay, I may be Sav'd, and I tell you, That you are Damn*d: 'tis true, you ſay ſo, but I am never the more Damn'd for your ſaying ſo, and you not ſurer of your Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for my not Judging of you, but I ſhew my Chriſtian Charity towards you, in not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of you, and I dare do no other, becauſe Chriſt hath forbid me; for it is my whole delight to ſubmit to his Will; therefore I am the Mother, and the Children are mine. I muſt needs confeſs that you are more pleaſanter and delightfuller than I am, for you know not what a Mothers care is, but delights your ſelf in all the pleaſant Things of this World, and Corrupts my Children, by incouraging them to do all thoſe Things that their Nature moſt inclines to; but I being a True Mother, I can give no Grains of Allowance contrary to the Word of God; for it is all my Care that they ſhould always walk obediently to that Rule, and that they may not only be Happy in this World, but eternally Happy in the World to come; therefore I will Apply my ſelf to the King of Heaven, that he would Vouchſafe to deliver my Children from thy Corruptions; and moreover I will make Applications to the King on Earth, and I queſtion not, but I ſhall have True Juſtice done me, and when God has reſtor'd me my Children from thy Deluſions, for their Honour I'll die, that they may live, that all may know that I am a True Mother. Therefore I moſt humbly beſeech your Majeſty to end this Controverſie, and I humbly beg the Favour that I may undertake for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and my Propoſal is this, <hi>That I would be ſbut into a Room with any</hi> Roman Catholick <hi>that is ſincere, and that there ſhould be but one Key to the Lock, and your Majeſty to keep the Key, and I will be ſearch'd, that I carry not any thing with me, and go in Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and remain ſo either Seven Days and Nights, or Nine Days and Nights, or as many as your Majeſty ſhall think fit, and I look that whoever undertakes it with me, ſhould do the ſame ſincerely, for I hate Deceit; but if it be a Man, I beſeech your Majeſty to let ſome Body be with me Day and Night, to prevent Scandal; and who can doubt but Nature is ſtrong in them, and they will have Aſſiſtance by the 'Prayers of their Fathers, who can Work Miracles, but all muſt know, that Nature is weak in me by my often Faſting, for I am Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now, and bath been ever ſince Friday, except Sunday Night, and now' till Tueſday Night; and therefore what I do muſt be by a ſtrong Faith, and the Aſſiſtance of the Almighty. Oh that it would but pleaſe God that this may be proved, for it will juſtifie all my Faſtings; to be true and right, and this will Convince the World that I have obtained Favour of the Almighty, for it is for his Glory, that his Anointed may be a King of Righteouſneſs, Truth and Juſtice, and Peace may flouriſh in your days. and after a Long and Proſperous Reign your Majeſty may be Crown'd with an Immortal Crown of Glory, which the Lord grant, is the Prayer of</hi>
