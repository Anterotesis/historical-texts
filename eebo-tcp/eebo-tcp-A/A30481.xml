         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F it be a Civility to return a speedy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to a demand or a message, I will
not fail to pay that respect to the late
Author of <hi>Exceptions against the Theory
of the Earth.</hi> I know, short follies, and
short quarrels, are the best: and to offer satisfaction
at the first opportunity, is the fairest way to put an
end to controversies. Besides, such personal alterca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as these, are but <hi>res periturae,</hi> which do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
much time or study; but, like Repartees, are best
made off hand, and never thought on more. I only
desire that friendliness, that some allowance may be
made as to unaccuracy of style: which is always al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
in hasty dispatches.</p>
            <p>I shall make no excursions from the Subject, nor
use any other method than to follow the learned <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor</hi>
from Chapter to Chapter, and observe his steps
and motions, so far as they are contrary to the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory.
But if he divert out of his way, for his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
or other reasons best known to himself, I may
take notice of it perhaps, but shall not follow him any
further than my business leads me; having no design
to abridge his liberty, but to defend my own Writings
where they are attackt. Give me leave therefore, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any other preface or ceremony, to fall to our work.</p>

               <p>THIS Chapter is only an Introduction, and
treats of other things, without any particular
opposition to the Theory. And therefore I shall only
give you the Conclusion of it, in the Author's own
words:<note place="margin">Pag. 44.</note> 
                  <hi>So much for the first Chapter; which may be
reckoned as an Introduction to the following Discourse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which
if any shall look upon as a Collection of Notes somewhat
confusedly put together, rather than a formal, well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
Treatise, they will entertain the best or truest Idea
of it.</hi> A severe Censure: But every man best under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands

               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <p>HERE he begins to enter upon particular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions:
and his first head is against the <hi>Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Earth,</hi> as explain'd by the Theory. To this
he gives but one exception in this chapter:<note place="margin">Pag. 45.</note> Namely,
that <hi>It would have taken up too much time. The World
being made in six days.</hi> Whereas many separations of
the Chaos and of the Elements, were to be made, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Theory, which could not be dispatch'd
in so short a time. To this Exception the general An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
may be this; either you take the Hypothesis of
an ordinary Providence, or of an extraordinary, as
to the time allowed for the Formation of the Earth;
If you proceed according to an ordinary Providence,
the formation of the Earth would require much more
time than Six days. But if according to an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
you may suppose it made in six minutes, if
you please. 'Twas plain work, and a simple process,
according to the Theory; consisting only of such and
such separations, and a Concretion: And either of
these might be accelerated, and dispatch'd in a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
or shorter time, as Providence thought fit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:50178:3"/>However this Objection does not come well from
the hands of this Author, who makes all the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of the Earth, (the most operose part of it, as
one would think) to be rais'd in a small parcel of a
day, by the heat and action of the Sun. As we shall
find in the 10<hi>th.</hi> Chapter, hereafter. He seems to
proceed by natural Causes, for such are the heat and
action of the Sun: and if so, he will find himself as
much straiten'd for time, as the Theorist can be:
But if he say, the work of Nature and of the Sun was
accelerated by an extraordinary power, he must allow
us to say the same thing of the Separations of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os,
and the first Concretion of the Earth. For he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
reasonably debar us that liberty which he takes
himself, unless we have debarr'd and excluded our
selves. Now 'tis plain the Theorist never excluded
an extraordinary Providence in the formation and
construction of the Earth; as appears and is openly
exprest in many parts of the Theory.<note place="margin">Eng. <hi>Theor. p.</hi> 65.</note> See, if you
please, the conclusion of the <hi>fifth Chapter,</hi> which treats
about the formation of the Earth. The last paragraph
is this: <hi>Give me leave onely, before we proceed any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to annex here a short Advertisement, concerning the
Causes of this wonderful Structure of the first Earth: 'Tis
true, we have propos'd the Natural Causes of it, and I do
not know wherein our Explication is false or defective;
but in things of this kind we may easily be too credulous.
And this Structure is so marvellous, that it ought rather
to be consider'd as a particular effect of the Divine Art,
than as the work of Nature. The whole Globe of the water
vaulted over, and the exteriour Earth hanging above the
Deep, sustain'd by nothing but its own measures and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Construction: A building without foundation or
Corner-stone. This seems to be a piece of Divine Geometry
or Architecture; and to this, I think, is to be refer'd that
magnificent Challenge which God Almighty made to</hi> Job;
Where was thou when I laid the foundations of the
Earth? Declare, &amp;c. Moses <hi>also, when he had describ'd the
Chaos, saith,</hi> The Spirit of God mov'd upon, <hi>or sat brooding
upon</hi> the face of the waters; <hi>without all doubt to produce
some effects there. And St.</hi> Peter, <hi>when he speaks of the form
of the Ante-diluvian Earth, how it stood in reference to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50178:4"/>
waters, adds,</hi> By the word of God, <hi>or by the wisdom of God</hi>
it was made so. <hi>And this same wisdom of God, in the</hi>
Proverbs, <hi>as we observed before, takes notice of this very
piece of work in the formation of the Earth:</hi> When he
set an Orb over the face of the Deep, I was there.
<hi>Wherefore to the great Architect, who made the boundless
Vniverse out of nothing, and form'd the Earth out of a
Chaos, let the praise of the whole work, and particularly
of this Master-piece, for ever with all honour be given</hi> In
like manner,<note place="margin">Eng. <hi>Theor. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> 106. 107.</note> there is a larger account of Providence,
both Ordinary and Extraordinary, as to the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Natural World, in the last Paragraph of
the 8<hi>th.</hi> Chapter; and like reflections are made in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places when occasion is offer'd.</p>
               <p>We have not therefore any where excluded the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
and benefit of superiour causes, where the
case requires it. Especially when 'tis only to modify
the effect, as to time and dispatch. And in that case
none will have more need of it than himself, as we
shall find in the examination of his Tenth Chapter,
about the Origine of Mountains.</p>
               <p>The rest of this Second Chapter is spent in three
Excursions. One in justifying the Cartesian way of
forming Light and the Sun, as agreeable to <hi>Moses.</hi>
The Second about the <hi>Iewish Cabala,</hi> and <hi>Cabalistical
interpretations.</hi> And the Third about <hi>Mystical num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi>
But the Theory not being concern'd in these
things, I leave them to the Author and his Readers,
to enjoy the pleasure and profit of them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the Third Chapter.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <p>IN This Chapter a Second Exception against the
formation of the Earth, as propos'd in the Theory,
is alledg'd: And 'tis this, The fluctuation of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os,
or of that first watery Globe, would hinder, he
says, any Concretion of Earth upon its surface. Not
that there were Winds or Storms then, to agitate
those waters. Neither would the motion of the
Earth, or the rotation of that Globe, disturb them,
as he allows there.<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 74. lin. 18, 19.</note> But the disturbance would have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50178:4"/>
rise from Tides, or the ebbings and flowings of that
great Ocean: which, he says, must have been then, as
well as now. And the reason he gives is this, Because
the Flux and Reflux of the Sea depend upon the Moon:
And the Moon was then present, as he says, in our
Heavens, or in our Vortex: and therefore would have
the same effect then, upon that Body of waters which
lay under it, that it hath now upon the Sea.</p>
               <p>That the Moon was in the Heavens, and in our
Neighbourhood, when the Earth was form'd, he
proves from the Six-days Creation: and spends two
or three pages in wit and scolding upon this subject.<note place="margin">p. 77, 78. 79.</note>
But, with his leave, when all is done, his argument will
be of no force, unless he can prove that <hi>the Fourth
Day's Creation was before the Third.</hi> I confess, I have
heard of a wager that was lost upon a like case, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
whether <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th.</hi> was before <hi>Henry</hi> the 7<hi>th?</hi>
But that was done by complot in the Company, to
whom it was referr'd to decide the Question. We have
no plot here, but appeal fairly to that Judge the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter
hath chosen, namely to Scripture, which tells
us, that the Moon was made the 4<hi>th.</hi> Day and the
Earth was form'd the 3<hi>d.</hi> Therefore unless the 4<hi>th.</hi>
Day was before the 3<hi>d.</hi> the Moon could not hinder
the formation of the Earth.</p>
               <p>But, I hope, say you, this is a misrepresentation. The
Animadverter sure would not put the matter upon
this issue. Yes, he does. For when he had oppos'd
to our Formation of the Earth, the Fluctuation of
the Waters: caus'd, as he phrases it, by the <hi>bulkie
presence</hi> of the Moon, He concludes with these words,
(p. 77. Paragr. 3.) <hi>But in reference to this matter, there
is a Doubt made by the Theorist, which must be consider'd
and removed. Otherwise most of what hath been said,
touching the instability and fluctuation of these Waters,
will be vain and groundless. The Doubt is, Whether the
Moon were then in our neighbourhood.</hi> You see that
matter is put upon this issue, Whether the Moon was
in the Neighbourhood of the Earth, at the time of its
formation. We say she was not, and prove it by this
plain argument: If she was not in Being at that time,
she was not in our Neighbourhood: But unless the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50178:5"/>
4<hi>th.</hi> day was before the 3<hi>d.</hi> she was not in Being. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But after all, If the Moon had been present then,
and there had been Tides, or any other fluctuation
towards the Poles, we have no reason to believe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the experiences we have now, that that
would have hinder'd the formation of the Earth, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the surface of the Chaos. For why should they
have hinder'd that more, than they do the formation
of Ice upon the Surface of the Sea? We know, in cold
Regions, the Seas are frozen, notwithstanding their
Tides. And in the mouths of Rivers, where there is
both the current and stream of the River on one
hand, and the counter-current of the Tides on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
these together cannot hinder the Concretion that
is made on the Surface of the Water. And our water
is a substance more thin, and easily broken, than that
tenacious film was, that cover'd the Chaos. WHERE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORE,
upon all suppositions, we have reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that no fluctuations of the Chaos could hinder
the formation of the First Earth.</p>
               <p>Lastly, The Observator opposes the reasons that are
given by the Theorist, <hi>why the presence of the Moon</hi> was
less needful in the first World. Namely, <hi>because there
were no long Winter-nights: nor the great Pool of the Sea
to move or govern.</hi> As to the Second reason, 'tis onely
Hypothetical: and if the Hypothesis be true, <hi>That</hi>
there was no open Sea at that time, (which must be
else-where examin'd) the consequence is certainly true.
But as to the first reason, He will not allow the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
tho' the Hypothesis be admitted. For he
says,<note place="margin">p. 79.</note> 
                  <hi>As there were no long Winter-nights then, so there
were no short Summer ones neither. So that set but the
one against the other, and the presence of the Moon may
seem to have been as needful then, in regard of the length
of nights, as she is now.</hi> This looks like a witty obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
but it does not reach the point. Is there as
much need of the Moon in <hi>Spain,</hi> as in <hi>Lapland,</hi> or
the Northern Countries? There is as much Night in
one place as another, within the compass of a Year:
but the great inconvenience is, when the Night falls
upon the hours of Travel, or the hours of work and
business. For if it fall onely upon hours of sleep, or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50178:5"/>
of rest and retirement: as it does certainly more in
<hi>Spain,</hi> and in those Climates that approach nearer to
and Equinox, the Moon is there less necessary in that
respect. We can sleep without Moon-shine, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Light; but we cannot travel, or do business abroad,
without hazard and great inconvenience, if there be
no light. So that the reason of the Theorist holds
good <hi>viz.</hi> That there would be more necessity of
Moon shine in long Winter-Nights, than in a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Equinox.</p>
               <p>We proceed now to the rest of this Chapter, which
is made up of some secondary Charges against this
part of the Theory, concerning the Chaos and the
Formation of the first Earth. As first, that it is <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 80, 81<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 83.</note>
Secondly, <hi>Vnphilosophical:</hi> and Thirdly, <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptural,</hi>
which we shall answer in order. He seems
to offer at three or four instances of <hi>precariousness,</hi> as
to the ingredients of the Chaos, their proportions, and
separations. But his quarrel is chiefly with the oily
particles. These he will scarce allow at all: nor that
they could separate themselves, in due time, to receive
the Terrestrial: at least in due proportions.</p>
               <p>First, He would have no oily particles in the Chaos.
But why so, I pray? what proof or just exception is
there against them? Why may there not be original
Oily particles, as well as original Salt particles? Such
as your great master <hi>D. Cartes</hi> supposes.<note place="margin">Prin. ph. l. 4. §. 84. Meteor. c. 1. §. 8.</note> He who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders
that vast quantity of Oleagineous matter that
is disperst every where: in Vegetables, in Animals, and
in many sorts of Earths: And that this must have
been from the beginning, or as soon as the Earth
had any furniture: will see reason to believe that such
particles must be thought Original and Primeval. Not
forg'd below the Abyss, and extracted from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
regions of the Earth. For that would require
a process of many ages; whereas these being the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Fertility, it is reasonable to suppose that a
New World abounds with them more than an Old
one. Lastly, if we suppose Oily particles to be tenuious
and branchy, as your Philosopher does, too gross to
be Air, and too light for Water: Why should we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that in that vast mass and variety of particles,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50178:6"/>
whereof the Chaos consisted, there should not be any
of this figure, as well as of others? Or, what reason
is there to suppose, that there are none of that figure,
but what are brought from the inferiour Regions of
the Earth? For, of all others, these seem to be the
most unlikely, if not incapable, of being extracted
from thence. And if there be only a gradual diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
in magnitude and mobility, betwixt the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Air and of Oil,<note place="margin">Prin. phil. l. 4. §. 76.</note> as that Philosopher seems to
suppose, why must we exclude these degrees, and yet
admit the higher and lower?</p>
               <p>The second thing which he charges with <hi>precarious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
is the separation of this Oily matter, in due time,
so as to make a mixture and concretion with the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial
particles that fell from above. This objection
was both made and answered by the Theorist:<note place="margin">Eng. Theor. p. 58, 59.</note> which
the Observator might have vouchsaf'd to have taken
notice of: and either confuted the answer, or spar'd
himself the pains of repeating the objection.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>precariousness</hi> is concerning the quantity
and proportion of these particles: and the fourth,
concerning the quantity and proportion of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The Excepter, it seems, would have had the
Theorist to have gag'd these liquors, and told him the
just measure and proportion of each. But in what
Theory or Hypothesis is that done? Has his great Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher,
in his Hypothesis of <hi>Three Elements,</hi> (which
the Excepter makes use of, <hi>p.</hi> 52.) Or in his several Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
of the unform'd Earth, in the 4<hi>th Book of his
Principles,</hi> defin'd the quantity and dimensions of each?
Or in the Mineral particles and juices, which he draws
from the lower Regions, does he determine the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of them? And yet these, by their excess or defect,
might be of great inconvenience to the World. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do I censure him for these things, as <hi>precarious.</hi>
For when the nature of a thing admits a latitude, the
original quantity of it is left to be determin'd by the
effects: and the Hypothesis stands good, if neither
any thing antecedent, nor any present <hi>phoenomena</hi> can
be alledged against it.</p>
               <p>But if these examples from his great Philosopher,
be not sufficient, I will give him one from an Author
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50178:6"/>
beyond all exception: and that is from himself. Does
the Animadverter in his new Hypothesis concerning
the Deluge, <hi>ch.</hi> 15. give us the just proportions of his
Rock-water, and the just proportions of his Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water,
that concurred to make the Deluge? I find
no calculations there, but general expressions, that
the one was far greater than the other: and that may
be easily presumed concerning the oily substance and
the watery in the Chaos.<note place="margin">p. 80, 81.</note> What scruples therefore
he raises in reference to the Chaos, against the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist,
for not having demonstrated the proportions of
the liquors of the Abyss, fall upon his own Hypoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,
for the same or greater reasons. And you know
what the old verse says, <hi>Turpe est Doctori, cum culpa
redarguit ipsum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But however,<note place="margin">p. 81.</note> He will have such exceptions to stand
good against the Theorist, tho' they are not good against
other persons. Because the Theorist
stands upon<note n="*" place="margin">Ego quidem in eâ sum sententiâ. si
in harum rerum de quibus agitur, cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitionem,
aut aliarum quarumcunque,
quae momenti sunt, visum fuerit Deo
aut Naturae ut pateret hominibus ratio

in one place of his Book, has this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<hi>Ego quidem, &amp;c.</hi> These words,
I think, are very little exceptionable,
if they be taken with the Context.
For this Evidence and certainty
which the Theorist speaks of, is
brought in there in opposition to
such uncertain arguments as are taken from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of <hi>Fables</hi> and <hi>Symbols:</hi> or from <hi>Etymolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies</hi>
and <hi>Grammatical Criticisms,</hi> which are expresly
mention'd in the preceding discourse. And yet this
sentence, because it might be taken in too great an
extent, is left out in the 2<hi>d</hi> Edition of the Theory, and
therefore none had reason to insist upon it. But I see
the Excepter puts himself into a state of War, and
thinks there is no foul play against an Enemy.</p>
               <p>So much for his charge of <hi>precariousness.</hi> We now
come to the 2<hi>d,</hi> which is call'd <hi>unphilosophicalness.</hi> And
why is the Theorist, in this case, unphilosophical? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
says the Excepter, He supposes Terrestrial par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
to be disperst through the whole Sphere of the
Chaos, as high as the Moon. And why not, pray,
if it be a meer Chaos? where, antecedently to separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50178:7"/>
all things are mixt and blended without distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of gravity or levity. Otherwise it is not a meer
Chaos. And when separations begin to be made, and
distinction of parts and regions, so far it is ceasing to
be a meer Chaos. But then, says the Observator, why
did not the Moon come down, as well as these Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial
particles? I answer by another question, Why
does not the Moon come down now? Seeing she is
still in our Vortex, and at the same distance; and so
the same reason which keeps her up now, kept her up
then. Which reason he will not be at a loss to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
if he understand the principles of his great
Philosopher.</p>
               <p>We come now to the last charge, That the Theory,
in this part of it, is <hi>Antiscriptural.</hi> And why so? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it supposes the Chaos <hi>dark,</hi> whereas the Scripture
says there was Light the first day. Well, but does the
Scripture say that the Chaos was thoroughly illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
the first day?<note place="margin">Pag. 52.</note> the Excepter, as I remember, makes
the primigenial Light to have been the Rudiment of
a Sun:<note place="margin">lin. 17.</note> and calls it there a <hi>faint light,</hi> and a <hi>feeble
light;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">lin. 27.</note> and in this place, <hi>a faint glimmering.</hi> If then
the Sun, in all its strength and glory, cannot some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
dispel a mist out of the Air, what could this
<hi>faint, feeble glimmering</hi> do, towards the dissipation of
such a gross caliginous opacity, as that was? This
Light might be sufficient to make some distinction of
Day and Night in the Skies; and we do not find any
other mark of its strength in Scripture, nor any other
use made of it.</p>
               <p>So we have done with this Chapter. Give me leave
only, without offence, to observe the style of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter
in reference to Scripture and the Theory. He
is apt to call every thing <hi>antiscriptural,</hi> that suits not
his Sence. Neither is that enough, but he must also
call it a <hi>bold affront</hi> to Scripture.<note place="margin">p. 78.</note> He confesses, he hath
made a <hi>little bold</hi> with Scripture himself,<note place="margin">p. 299. <hi>pen.</hi>
                  </note> in his new
Hypothesis. How much that <hi>little</hi> will prove, we
shall see hereaster. But however as to that hard word,
<hi>affront,</hi> a discreet man, as he is not apt to give as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front,
so neither is he forward to call every cross word
an affront. Both those humours are extremes, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50178:7"/>
breed quarrels. Suppose a Man should say boldly,
God Almighty <hi>hath no right hand.</hi> Oh, might the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverter
cry, <hi>That's a bold affront to Scripture:</hi> For,
I can shew you many and plain Texts of Scripture,
both in the Old Testament, and in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
where express mention is made of God's <hi>Right
Hand.</hi> And will you offer to oppose <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy</hi>
to express words of Scripture, often repeated,
and in both Testaments? <hi>O Tempora, O Mores.</hi> So far
as my observation reaches, weak reasons commonly
produce strong passions. When a Man hath clear
reasons, they satisfie and quiet the mind, and he is not
much concern'd whether others receive his notions, or
no. But when we have a strong aversion to an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
from other Motives and Considerations: and
find our reasons doubtful or insufficient, then, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the course of humane nature, the passions rise
for a further assistance: and what is wanting in point
of argument, is made up by invectives and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.</p>

from it.</hi> To form an habitable Earth from a Chaos
given, and to show all the great Periods and general
Changes of that Earth, throughout the whole course
of its duration, or while it remain'd an Earth, was the
adequate design of the Theorist. And was this design
so short or shallow, that it could not satisfy the great
Soul of the Excepter? but it must be a <hi>flaw</hi> in the
Hypothesis,<note place="margin">p<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 88.</note> that it did go higher than the Chaos. We

Unless it was design'd to show the learning of the

               <p>FRom the manner of the Earth's formation,<note place="margin">p. 106.</note> the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter
now proceeds to the <hi>Form</hi> of it, if complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And his first Exception is, That it would want
<hi>Waters</hi> or Rivers to water it. He says there would
either be no Rivers at all: or none, at least, in due
time.</p>
               <p>The Theorist hath replenisht that Earth with Rivers,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50178:8"/>
flowing from the extreme parts of it towards the
middle, in continual streams: and watering, as a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
all the intermediate climates. And this constant
supply of water was made from the Heavens, by an
uninterrupted stream of Vapours: which had their
course through the Air, from the middle parts of the
Earth towards the extreme; and falling in Rains, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
again upon the surface of the Earth, from the
extreme parts to the middle. For that Earth being
of an Oval, or something oblong figure, there would
be a declivity all a-long, or descent, from the Polar
parts towards the Equinoctial, which gave course and
motion to these waters. And the vapors above ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
failing in their course, the Rivers would never fail
below; but a perpetual Circulation would be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd,
betwixt the waters of the Heavens and of the
Earth.</p>
               <p>This is a short account of the state of the Waters in
the Primeval Earth. Which you may see represented
and explain'd more at large, in the 2<hi>d. Book of the
Theory, Chap.</hi> 5. And this, I believe, is an Idea more
easily conceived, than any we could form concerning
the Waters and Rivers of the present Earth, if we
had not experience of them. Suppose a Stranger
that had never seen this Terraqueous Globe, where
we live at present, but was told the general Form of
it: How the Sea lies, how the Land, and what was
the constitution of the Heavens: If this Stranger was
askt his opinion, whether such an Earth was habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table:
and particularly, whether they could have wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
commodiously in such an Earth, and how the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
Countries would be supplied? I am apt to think,
he would find it more difficult (upon an Idea onely,
without experience) to provide Waters for such an
Earth, as ours is at present, than for such an one as
the Primeval Earth was. 'Tis true, He would easily
find Rains, possible and natural: but with no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
or regularity; and these he might imagine
would onely make transient torrents, not any fixt and
permanent Rivers. But as for Fountains deriv'd from
the Sea, and breaking out in higher grounds, I am
apt to believe, all his Philosophy would not be able
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50178:9"/>
to make a clear discovery of them. But things that
are familiar to us by experience, we think easie in
speculation, or never enquire into the causes of them.
Whereas, other things that never fall under our expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
tho' more simple and intelligible in themselves,
we reject often as Paradoxes or Romances. Let this
be applied to the present case, and we proceed to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
the Exceptions.</p>
               <p>Let us take that Exception first, as most material,
that pretends there would have been no Rivers at all
in the Primeval Earth,<note place="margin">p. 114.</note> if it was of such a Form as
the Theorist has describ'd. And for this He gives one
grand Reason, <hi>Because</hi> the Regions towards the Poles,
where the Rains are suppos'd to fall, and the Rivers
to rise, would have been all frozen and congeal'd:
and consequently no fit Sources of water for the rest
of the Earth. Why we should think those Regions
would be frozen, and the Rains that fell in them, he
gives two Reasons, the Distance, and the Obliquity of
the Sun. As also the experience we have now, of the
coldness and frozenness of those parts of the Earth.
But as to the Distance of the Sun, He confesses that is
not the thing <hi>that does onely or chiefly</hi> make a Climate
cold.<note place="margin">p. 118.</note> He might have added, <hi>particularly in that Earth,
where the Sun was never at a greater distance than the
Equator.</hi> Then as to the Obliquity of the Sun, neither
was that so great, nor so considerable, in the first
Earth, as in the present. Because the Body of that
lay in a direct position to the Sun, whereas the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Earth lies in an Oblique. And tho' the Polar
circles or circumpolar parts of that Earth, did not
lie so perpendicular to the Sun as the Equinoctial,
and consequently were cooler, yet there was no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of their being frozen or congeal'd. It was more
the moisture and excessive Rains of those parts that
made them uninhabitable, than the extreme coldness
of the Climate, of it self. And if the Excepter had
well consider'd the differences betwixt the present and
primitive Earth: as to obliquity of position, and, that
which follows from it, the length of Nights: He
would have found no reason to have charg'd that
Earth with <hi>nipping and freezing cold;</hi> where there was
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50178:9"/>
not, I believe, one morsel of Ice from one pole to
another. But that will better appear, if we consider
the causes of Cold.</p>
               <p>There are three general causes of Cold: the distance
of the Sun, his Obliquity, and his total Absence; I
mean in the Nights. As to distance, that alone must
be of little effect, seeing there are many Planets, (which
must not be lookt upon as meer lumps of Ice) at a
far greater distance from the Sun than ours. And as
to Obliquity, you see it was much less considerable in
the respective parts of the Primitive Earth, than of the
present. Wherefore these are to be consider'd but as
secondary causes of Cold, in respect of the third, the
total absence of the Sun in the night time. And where
this happens to be long and tedious, there you must
expect excess of Cold. Now in the primitive Earth
there was no such thing, as long winter nights, but
every where, a perpetual Equinox, or a perpetual Day.
And consequently, there was no room or cause of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
cold in any part of it. But on the contrary,
the case is very different in the present Earth. For in
our Climate, we have not the presence of the Sun,
in the depth of Winter, half as long as he is absent.
And towards the Poles they have nights that last se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
weeks or months together. And then 'tis, that the
Cold rages, binds up the ground, freezes the Ocean,
and makes those parts, more or less, uninhabitable. But
where no such causes are, you need not fear any such
effects.</p>
               <p>Thus much to shew that there might be Rains,
Waters, and Rivers, in the primigenial Earth, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the extreme parts of it, without any danger of
freezing. But however, says the other part of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
<hi>These Rivers would not be made in due time.</hi>
That's wholly according to the process you take; It
you take a meer natural process, the Rivers could not
flow throughout the Earth, all on a sudden: but you
may accelerate that process, as much as you please,
by a Divine Hand. As to this particular indeed of
the Rivers, one would think there should be no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
for their sudden flowing through the Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
because mankind could not be suddenly propagated
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50178:10"/>
throughout the Earth. And if they did but lead the
way, and prepare the ground, in every countrey, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mankind arrived there, that seems to be all that
would be necessary upon their account. Neither can
it be imagin'd, but that the Rivers would flow faster
than mankind could follow; for 'tis probable, in the
first hundred years, men did not reach an hundred
miles from home, or from their first habitations: and
we cannot suppose the defluxion of Water, upon any
declivity, to be half so slow. As to the chanels of these
Rivers, the manner of their progress, and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
Those things are set down fully enough
in the 5<hi>th Chapter</hi> of the 2<hi>d Book</hi> of the <hi>English Theory,</hi>
and it would be needless to repeat them here.</p>
               <p>But the Anti-theorist says, this slow production and
propagation of Rivers is contrary to Scripture: Both
because of the Rivers of Paradise, and also because
Fishes were made the Sixth day. As to that of the
Fishes, He must first prove that those were River<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fishes;<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 22. &amp; 22.</note>
for the Scripture makes them Sea-fish, and
instances in great Whales. But he says, (<hi>p.</hi> 113, 114.)
it will <hi>appear in the sequel of his Discourse,</hi> that the
Abyss could be no receptacle of fishes. To that sequel
of his Discourse therefore we must refer the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this particular. Then as to Paradise, that was
but one single spot of ground,<note place="margin">ch. 13.</note> according to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Hypothesis: which he seems to adhere to; and
Rivers might be there as soon as he pleases, seeing its
seat is not yet determin'd. But as for the Lands which
they are said to traverse or encompass, that might be
the work of time, when their chanels and courses
were extended and setled. As they would be doubtless
long before the time that <hi>Moses</hi> writ that description.
But as to the <hi>Rivers of Paradise,</hi> it would be a long
story to handle that dispute here. And 'tis fit the
Authors should first agree amongst themselves, before
we determine the original of its River, or Rivers.</p>

               <p>WE come now to the Deluge:<note place="margin">p. 121.</note> where the great
Exception is this, That according to the
Theory, the Deluge would have come to pass, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mankind had been degenerate or no.</p>
               <p>We know mankind did degenerate, and 'tis a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
thing to argue upon false suppositions: and to
tell what would have come to pass, in case such a
thing had not come to pass. Suppose <hi>Adam</hi> had not
sin'd,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 4. 1 Pet. 1. 20. Apoc. 13. 8.</note> what would have become of the <hi>Messiah</hi> and
the Dispensation of the Gospel? which yet is said to
have been determin'd more early than the Deluge.
Let the Anti-theorist answer himself this question, and
he may answer his own.</p>
               <p>But to take a gentler instance, Suppose <hi>Adam</hi> had
not eaten the forbidden fruit: How could He and all
his Posterity have liv'd in Paradise? A few generations
would have fill'd that place, and should the rest have
been turn'd out into the wide World, without any
sin or fault of theirs? You suppose the Ante-diluvian
Heavens and Earth to have been the same with the
present, and consequently subject to the same acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
and inconveniences. The action of the Sun
would have been the same then, as now, according
to your Hypothesis: The same excesses of heat and
cold, in the several regions and climates: The same
Vapours and Exhalations extracted out of the Earth:
The same impurities and corruptions in the air: and,
in consequence of these, the same external disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to Epidemical distempers. Besides, there would
be the same storms and tempests at Sea, the same
Earth-quakes and other desolations at Land. So that
<hi>had all the Sons and Daughters of men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 122.</note> to use the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter's
elegant style, <hi>been as pure and bright, as they
could possibly have dropt out of the mint of Creation, They
should still</hi> have been subject to all these inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and calamities. If mankind had continued spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and undegenerate till the Deluge, or for sixteen
hundred years, they might as well have continued so
for sixteen hundred more. And in a far less time,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50178:11"/>
according to their fruitfulness and multiplication, the
whole face of the Earth would have been thick co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with inhabitants: every Continent and every
Island, every Mountain and every Desert, and all the
climates from Pole to Pole. But could naked inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
have liv'd happy in the frozen Zones! where
Bears and Foxes can scarce subsist. In the midst of
Snows and Ice, thick foggs, and more than Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
darkness, for some months together. Would all
this have been a <hi>Paradise,</hi> or a Paradisiacal state, to
these Virtuous Creatures? I think it would be more
adviseable for the Excepter, not to enter into such
disputes, grounded only upon suppositions. God's
prescience is infallible, as his counsels are immutable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Excepter further suggests,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 121.</note> 
                  <hi>that the Theory
does not allow a judicial and extraordinary Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

mankind. Which, I must needs say, is an untrue

by Divine Providence, and from

upon a sinful world, that this

in the conclusion of that discourse

(Theor. p. 105.)</hi> In the mean time I do not know any
more to be added in this part, unless it be to conclude
with an advertisement to prevent any mistake or miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
as if this Theory, by explaining the Deluge in
a natural way, or by natural causes, did detract from the
power of God, by which that GREAT IVDGMENT
WAS BROVGHT VPON THE WORLD, IN A

<hi>And in the three following Paragraphs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Theor. p. 106, 107, 108.</note> 
                  <hi>which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude

               </p>
               <p>But it is a weakness however to think, that, when a
train is laid in Nature, and Methods concerted, for
the execution of a Divine Judgment, therefore it is
not <hi>Providential.</hi> God is the Author and Governor
of the Natural World, as well as of the Moral: and
He sees through the futuritions of both, and hath
so dispos'd the one, as to serve him in his just Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

to the honour of his Wisdom, so it is no way to the

suggests concerning Atheists, and their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd
cavils at such an explication of the Deluge, is a
thing only said at random and without grounds. On
the contrary, so to represent the sence of Scripture,
in natural things, as to make it unintelligible, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with Science and Philosophick truth, is one

               <head>CHAP. VII.</head>
               <p>THIS Chapter is about the places of Scripture,
alledg'd in confirmation of the Theory. And
chiefly concerning that remarkable Discourse in St.
<hi>Peter, 2 Epist.</hi> 3. which treats of the difference of the
Antediluvian World and the present World. That
Discourse is so fully explain'd in the <hi>Review of the
Theory,</hi> that I think it is plac'd beyond all exception.
And the Animadverter here makes his exception only
against the first words,<note place="margin">Ver. 5</note> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
which we thus render, <hi>For this they willingly are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi>
of. But he generally renders it, <hi>wilfully ignorant
of:</hi> and lays a great stress upon that word <hi>wilfully.</hi>
But if he quarrel with the <hi>English</hi> Translation, in this
particular, he must also fault the <hi>Vulgate,</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> and
all others that I have yet met withal. And it had
been very proper for him, in this case, to have given
us some Instances or proofs, out of Scripture or <hi>Greek</hi>
Authors, where this Phrase signifies a <hi>wilful and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50178:12"/>
ignorance.</hi> He says it must have been a wilful
ignorance, otherwise it was not blameable: whereas
St. <hi>Peter</hi> gives it a sharp reproof. I answer, There
are many kinds and degrees of blameable ignorance,
a contented ignorance, an ignorance from prejudices,
from non-attendance, and want of due examination.
These are all blameable in some degree, and all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
some reproof; but it was not their ignorance
that St. <hi>Peter</hi> chiefly reproves, but their deriding and
<hi>scoffing</hi> at the Doctrine of the coming of our Saviour,
and the Conflagration of the World. And therefore
He calls them <hi>Scoffers, walking after their own lusts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Excepter seems at length inclinable to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the foremention'd words,<note place="margin">p. 137.</note> thus, <hi>They are willingly
mindless or forgetful.</hi> And I believe the translation
would be proper enough. And what gentler reproof
can one give, than to say, you are <hi>willing to forget</hi> such
an Argument or such a Consideration. Which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
little more than non-attention, or an inclination
of the will towards the contrary opinion. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell what evidence or what Traditions they might
have then concerning the Deluge, but we know they
had the History of it by <hi>Moses,</hi> and all the marks in
Nature, that we have now, of such a Dissolution.
And They, that pretended to Philosophize upon the
works of Nature and the immutability of them, might
very well deserve that modest rebuke, That they were
<hi>willing to forget</hi> the first Heavens and first Earth, and
the destruction of them at the Deluge, when they
talkt of an immutable state of Nature.</p>
               <p>Neither is there any thing in all this, contrary to
what the Theorist had said,<note place="margin">Theor. c. 1.</note> concerning the Ancient
Philosophers, That none of them ever invented or
demonstrated from the causes, the true state of the
first Earth. This must be granted; But it is one
thing to demonstrate from the Causes, or by way of
Theory, and another thing to know at large: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by Scripture, Tradition, or collection from effects.
The mutability and changes of the World, which
these Pseudo Christians would not allow of, was a
knowable thing, taking all the means which they
might and ought to have attended to: At least, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50178:12"/>
they should have proceeded so far as to reject
the Christian doctrine concerning the future changes
of the World, with scorn and derision. Which is
the very thing the Apostle so much censur'd them
for.</p>
               <p>So much for what is said by the Excepter concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
this place of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> To all the rest he gives
an easie answer, (in the Contents of this Chapter) <hi>viz.</hi>
That they are <hi>Figurative, and so not argumentative.</hi>
The places of Scripture upon which the Theory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
are stated distinctly and in order, in the RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIEW:
and, to avoid repetitions, we must sometimes
refer to that:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Review,</hi> p. 29, &amp;c.</note> particularly, as to two remarkable pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 24. 2. and <hi>Psal.</hi> 136. 6. concerning the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
and Extension of the Earth upon the Seas.</hi> Which
the Excepter quickly dispatches by the help of a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi>
and a <hi>Figure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next He proceeds to, is, <hi>Psal. 33. 7. He gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the waters of the Sea, as in a Bagg: He layeth up the
Abysses in store-houses.</hi> But, he says, it should be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
as <hi>on a heap:</hi> which is the <hi>English</hi> Translation.
Whether the Authorities produc'd, in this case, by the
Theorist<note n="*" place="margin">Eng. Theor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 86.</note>, or by the Excepter, are more considerable,
I leave the Reader to judge. But however, he cites
another place, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 13. where the same word is
us'd and apply'd to the Red-Sea, which could not be
enclos'd as in a bag. Take whether Translation you
please for this second place; it is no prejudice to the
Theory, if you render it <hi>on an heap:</hi> for it was a
thing done by Miracle. But the other place speaks of
the ordinary posture and constitution of the waters,
which is not <hi>on a heap,</hi> but in a level or spherical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vexity
with the rest of the Earth. This reason the
Animadverter was not pleas'd to take notice of,<note place="margin">p. 86.</note> tho'
it be intimated in that same place of the Theory which
he quotes. But that which I might complain of most,
is his unfair citation of the next Paragraph of the
Theory,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Excep.</hi> p. 140.</note> which he applies peculiarly to this Text of
<hi>Psal.</hi> 33. 7. whereas it belongs to all the Texts alledg'd
out of the <hi>Psalms,</hi> and is a modest reflection upon the
explication of them. As the Reader may plainly see,
if he please to look the Theory, and compare it with
his citation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:50178:13"/>The next place he attacks, is, <hi>Iob 26. 7. He stretches
the North over the Tohu,</hi> or, as we render it, <hi>over the
empty places: and hangeth the Earth upon nothing.</hi> Here
he says,<note place="margin">p. 141.</note> 
                  <hi>Iob</hi> did either accommodate himself to the
vulgar, or else was a perfect <hi>Platonist.</hi> Methinks <hi>Plato</hi>
should rather be a <hi>Iobist,</hi> if you will have them to
imitate one another. Then he makes an Objection,
and answers it himself: Concluding however, that
<hi>Iob</hi> could not but mean this of the present Earth,
because in the next Verse he mentions <hi>Clouds.</hi> But
how does it appear, that every thing that <hi>Iob</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in that Chapter, refers to the same time.</p>
               <p>The next place, is, <hi>Iob 38. 4, 5, 6. Where wast thou
when I laid the foundations of the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. These elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
expostulations of the Almighty, he applies all to
the present Form of the Earth: where he says, there
are the <hi>Embossings of Mountains, the Enamelling of lesser
Seas, the open-work of the vast Ocean, and the Fret-work of
Rocks,</hi> &amp;c. These make a great noise, but they might
all be apply'd to the ruines of an old Bridge, fallen
into the water. Then he makes a large harangue in
commendation of Mountains and of the present Form
of the Earth: Which, if you please, you may compare
with the 10<hi>th. Chap.</hi> of the <hi>Latin Theory,</hi> and then make
your judgment upon both.</p>
               <p>But it is not enough for the Excepter to admire the
beauty of Mountains,<note place="margin">p. 146.</note> but he will make the Theorist
to do so too, because he hath exprest himself much
pleas'd with the sight of them. Can we be pleas'd
with nothing in an object, but the beauty of it? does
not the Theorist say there, in the very words cited by
the Excepter, <hi>Saepe loci ipsius insolentia &amp; spectaculorum
novitas delectat magis quam venustas in rebus notis &amp;
communibus.</hi> We are pleas'd in looking upon the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines
of a <hi>Roman</hi> Amphitheater, or a Triumphal Arch,
tho' time have defac'd its beauty. A man may be
pleas'd in looking upon a Monster, will you conclude
therefore that he takes it for a beauty? There are
many things in objects besides beauty, that may
please: but he that hath not sence and judgment e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to see the difference of those cases, and whence
the pleasure arises, it would be very tedious to beat it
into him by multitude of words.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:50178:13"/>After his commendation of Mountains, he falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the commendation of Rain: making those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
that enjoy it, to be better water'd than by Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
and consequently the present Earth better than
that Paradisiacal Earth describ'd by the Theorist.
And in this he says, he follows the rule of Scripture,
for these are his words.<note place="margin">p. 148.</note> 
                  <hi>And that these rule whereby
we measure the usefulness of this Earth, and shew it to
be more excellent than that of the Theory; are the most
true and proper rules: is manifest from God's making
use of the same, in a case not unlike: For he comparing
Egypt and Palestine, prefers the later before the former;
because in Egypt the Seed sown was</hi> watered with the
foot, as a Garden of herbs; <hi>but Palestine was</hi> a Land
of Hills and Valleys, and drank water of the rain of
Heaven, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. 10, 11.</p>
               <p>Let this rest a while. In the mean time let us take
notice how unluckily it falls out for the Observator,
that a Country, that had no rain, should be compared
in Scripture, or joyn'd in priviledge, with Paradise
it self, and the Garden of God. For so is this very
<hi>Aegypt, Gen.</hi> 13. 10. tho' it had no rain, but was wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
by Rivers. The words of Scripture are these.
<hi>And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,
that it was well watered every where, (before the
Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrha) even as the Garden
of the Lord, like the land of Aegypt.</hi> The Plain of
<hi>Iordan</hi> you see is commended for its fruitfulness and
being well watered: and as the height of its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
it is compar'd with <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and with the
<hi>Paradise of God.</hi> Now in <hi>Aegypt</hi> we know there was
little or no rain: and we read of none in Paradise:
but they were both water'd by Rivers. Therefore
the greatest commendation of a Land, for pleasure
and fertility, according to Scripture, is its being well
water'd with Rivers: which makes it like a paradise.
Surely then you cannot blame the Theorist, having
this authority besides all other reasons, for making
the <hi>Paradisiacal Earth</hi> to have been thus water'd.</p>
               <p>Now let the Excepter consider how he will inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
and apply his place in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> and make it
consistent with this in <hi>Genesis.</hi> Till I see a better Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50178:14"/>
I like this very well, tho' quite contrary
to his: Namely, <hi>That</hi> they were not to expect
such a Land as <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that was a Plain naturally fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
as being well water'd; But the Land they were
to possess, depended upon the benediction of Heaven:
And therefore they might expect more or less fertility,
according as they kept God's Commandments. And
so much for those two texts of Scripture.</p>
               <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">p. 149.</note> The Excepter in the conclusion of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
about that place in <hi>Iob,</hi> makes a reflection
upon the impropriety of those expressions in <hi>Iob,</hi>
about <hi>Foundations</hi> and <hi>Corner-stones,</hi> if they be apply'd
to the first Earth describ'd by the Theorist. But this
seems to me an Elegancy in that discourse, which he
makes a fault: whether it be understood as an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion
only to our manner of building, by deep
Foundations, and strong Corner-stones: Or an Iro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
interrogation, as it seems to me; implying, that
there was no Foundation, (strictly so call'd) nor
Corner-stone, in that great Work, tho' we cannot
build a cottage or little bridge without such prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
               <p>He proceeds then to the following verses in that
38<hi>th</hi> chap. <hi>Who shut up the Sea with doors, when it
broke forth as if it had issued out of a Womb?</hi> This the
Theorist understands of the <hi>Disruption</hi> of the <hi>Abyss</hi> at
the Deluge, when the Sea broke forth out of the womb
of the Earth: or out of that subterraneous cavity,
where it was enclosed as in a womb. 'Tis plainly
imply'd in the words of the Text, That the Sea was
shut up in some <hi>Womb,</hi> before it broke forth. I desire
therefore to know in what <hi>Womb</hi> that was. You will
find Interpreters much at a loss to give a fair answer
to that question: What was that inclos'd state of
the Sea? and what place, or part of Nature, was that
Receptacle where it lay? But the Excepter hath found
out a new answer. He says it was that <hi>Womb</hi> of non-entity.
These are his words, <hi>It just then</hi> (as its crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
gushed out of the womb of nothing, into existence.
This is a subtle and far-fetcht notion. Methinks the
<hi>Womb of nothing,</hi> is much what the same as <hi>no Womb.</hi>
And so this is no answer. But however let us consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50178:14"/>
how far it would suit this case, if it was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
If you understand the <hi>Womb of Non-entity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 2.</note> the
Sea broke out of that womb the first day, and had
no bars or doors set to it, but flow'd over all the
Earth without check or controul. Therefore that
could not be the time or state here spoken of. And
to refer that restraint, or those bars and doors, to
another time, which are spoken of here in the same
verse, would be very inexcusable in the Excepter:
Seeing he will not allow the Theorist to suppose those
things that are spoken of in different verses,<note place="margin">p. 150.</note> to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of different times. To conclude, this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysical
notion of the <hi>Womb of nothing,</hi> is altogether
impertinent, at least in this case: For the Text is
plainly speaking of things Local and Corporeal, and
this prison of the Sea must be understood as such.</p>
               <p>He proceeds now to the last place alledg'd, <hi>Prov. 8.
27, 28. When he prepared the Heavens, I was there:
when he set a Compass upon the face of the deep.</hi> The
word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which we render <hi>compass,</hi> he says, signifies
no more than the rotundity or spherical figure of the
Abyss. And so the fence will run thus, <hi>When God set
a rotundity,</hi> or <hi>spherical figure, upon the face of the
Abyss.</hi> But whereas the word may as well signifie a
<hi>Sphere</hi> or <hi>Orb,</hi> the Theorist thinks it more reasonable
that it should be so translated: and so the sentence
would run thus, <hi>When God set an Orb upon the face of
the Deep.</hi> And this discourse of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s, referring to
the beginning of the World, he thinks it rational to
understand it of the <hi>first habitable Earth:</hi> which was
really an <hi>Orb set over the face of the Deep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One cannot swear for the signification of a word
in every particular place, where it occurs: but when
there are two fences whereof it is capable, and the
one is much more important than the other, it is a
fair presumption to take it in the more important
sence; especially in such a place, and upon such an
occasion, where the great works of the Divine Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Power are celebrated: as they are here
by <hi>Solomon.</hi> And it cannot be deny'd, that our fence
of the words is more important than the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For of what consequence is it to say, <hi>God made the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50178:15"/>
Body of the Abyss round.</hi> Every one knows that Fluids
of their own accord run into that figure. So as that
would be a small remark upon a great occasion.</p>
               <p>The construction of this Orb we speak of, minds
me of an injustice which the Excepter hath done the
Theory, in the precedent part of this Chapter, by a
false accusation. For he says, The Theory makes the
construction of the first Earth to have been <hi>meerly
Mechanical.</hi> At least his words seem to signifie as
much,<note place="margin">p. 143.</note> which are these. <hi>And so its Formation,</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the first Earth, <hi>had been meerly Mechanical, as
the Theory makes it.</hi> That the construction was not
meerly Mechanical, in the opinion of the Theorist,
you may see, <hi>Eng. Theor. p.</hi> 65. which, because we
have cited it before, we will not here repeat. The
Theorist might also complain that the Excepter cites
the first Edition of the Theory for such things as are
left out in the second: which yet was printed a twelve-month
before his Animadversions. And therefore
in fairness he ought always to have consulted the
last Edition and last sence of the Author, before he
had censured him or his work. But this unfair me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
it seems, pleas'd his humour better: as you may
see in this Chapter,<note place="margin">p. 81. p. 100. last part. p. 154. p. 227, 228. p. 244. p. 279, 280. p. 288.</note> (<hi>p.</hi> 154.) and in several other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
where passages are cited and insisted upon, that
are no where to be found in the second Edition. Not
to mention his defective citations; omitting that part
that qualifies the sentence, as <hi>p.</hi> 99. last citation, and
else-where. I make this note that the Reader may
judge, how well this answers that <hi>sincerity,</hi> with which
he profest he would examine this work. <hi>Only as a
friend and servant to Truth. And therefore with such
Candour, Meekness and Modesty, as becomes one who as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes
and glories in so fair a Character, p.</hi> 43.</p>
               <p>The rest of this Chapter is a general Censure of
citations out of Scripture, that are only Tropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
or Figurative Scheams of Speech. These must
be made so indeed, if our sence of them be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd.
But what necessity is there of a figurative in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of all these Texts? The rule we go by,
and I think all good Interpreters, is this, That we are
not to leave the literal sence, unless there be a necessity
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50178:15"/>
from the subject matter. And there is no such neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
in this case, upon our Hypothesis: for it suits
with the literal sence. And 'tis to beg the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
to say the literal sence is not to be admitted,
because it complies too much with the Theory. But
as for that Text of his own, which he instances in, the
<hi>Pillars of the Earth tremble,</hi> that cannot be understood
(by the same Rule) of Pillars <hi>literally;</hi> because there
are no such Pillars of the Earth, upon any Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis.</p>

            <div n="8" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. VIII.</head>
               <p>THIS Chapter is concerning that grand property
of the Antediluvian Earth, a <hi>perpetual Equinox,</hi>
or a Right position to the Sun. This perpetual Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox
the Excepter will by no means admit. But I'me
afraid he mistakes the notion: for as he explains it in
the two first Sections of this Chapter, he seems to have
a false Idea of the whole matter. He thinks, I perceive,
that when the Earth chang'd its situation, it was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
from the Equator into the Ecliptick: and that
before that change, in the Antediluvian state, it mov'd
directly under the Equator. For these are his words,
<hi>So that in her Annual motion about the Sun,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 158.</note> namely, the
Earth before that change, <hi>she was carried directly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Equinoctial: without any manner of obliquity in
her site, or declination towards either of the Tropicks, in
her course; And therefore could never cut the Equinoctial,
by passing (as now she is presum'd to do) from one Tropick
to the other.</hi> By which words, you see, he imagines
that the Earth mov'd perpetually under the Equator,
when it had a perpetual Equinox. And when it came
out of that state, into this wherein it is now, it did
not only change its position, and the posture of its
Axis, but was also really translated from one part of
the Heavens into Another: namely, from under the
Equator to the Ecliptick, and so took another road
in its annual course about the Sun. This is a great
mistake: And I cannot blame him, if he was so averse
to admit this change, seeing it lay so cross in his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.
For what Pullies or Leavers should we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50178:16"/>
to remove the Earth out of the Equator into the
Ecliptick? <hi>Archimedes</hi> pretended, if he had ground to
plant his Engines upon, that he would move the Earth
out of its place; but that it was done before, I never
knew,<note place="margin">Lat. Theor. li. 2. c. 4.</note> nor heard of: And if the Excepter had consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
what is said in the Theory upon that occasion,
he might easily have prevented his mistake. But we
shall meet with the same Errour again in another
place; Let us consider now what Arguments he uses
against this change.</p>
               <p>He says,<note place="margin">p. 159.</note> 
                  <hi>If there had been such a change,</hi> either Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
or Mankind would have preserv'd the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of it. How far the memory of it hath been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,
we shall see hereafter. In the mean time, we
will give him instances of other things to reflect upon,
that are lost out of memory, unless he be the happy
Man that shall retrieve them. The <hi>Age of the World</hi>
hath not been preserv'd, either by the memory of
Man, or by the care of Providence. And was not
that both a thing of importance, and of easie preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?
<hi>Noah</hi> could not but know the Age of the
World, for he was contemporary with five or six Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations,
that were contemporary with <hi>Adam.</hi> And
knowing the Age of the World himself, he could not
easily forbear, one would think, to tell it to his Sons
and Posterity. But to this day, we do not know what
the true Age of the World is. There are three Bibles,
if I may so say, or three <hi>Pentateuchs,</hi> the <hi>Hebrew, Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan,</hi>
and <hi>Greek:</hi> which do all differ very consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
in their accounts, concerning the Age of the
World: and the most Learned men are not yet able
to determine with certainty, which of the three ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
is most authentick. Then, what think you of
the place of <hi>Paradise?</hi> How well is the memory or
knowledge of that preserv'd? Could <hi>Noah</hi> be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of it: and was it not a fit subject to discourse of,
and entertain his Sons and Nephews, and by them to
communicate it to Posterity? Yet we seek it still in
vain. The <hi>Iews</hi> were as much at a loss as we are:
and the Christian Fathers,<note place="margin">p. 263, 264, 265.</note> you think, were out in their
opinions, both about the place and conditions of it:
neither do you venture to determine them your self:
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50178:16"/>
so that Paradise is lost in a manner out of the world.
What wonder then if this single property of it be lost?
If the Excepter had well consider'd what the Theorist
has said concerning the Providential conduct of
knowledge in the World,<note place="margin">Eng. Theor. <hi>p.</hi> 286, 287.</note> this doubt or objection
might have been spar'd.</p>
               <p>After a long excursion, little to the purpose, but to
show his reading:<note place="margin">p. 166.</note> He tells us next, that Scripture does
not favour this notion of a perpetual Equinox before
the Flood: And cites <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 22. which the Theorist
had cited as a place that did suggest to us that vicis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situde
of Seasons that was establisht after the Flood.
The words indeed are not so determinate in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but that they may be understood, either of the
restauration of a former order in the Seasons of the
Year, or of the establishment of a new one. And in
whether sence they are to be taken, is to be determin'd
by collateral Reasons and Considerations. Such the
Theorist had set down, to make it probable, that they
ought to be understood as a Declaration of such an
Order for the Seasons of the Year, as was brought in
at that time, and was to continue to the end of the
World. The Excepter hath not thought fit to take
notice of, or refute, those Reasons, and therefore they
stand good, as formerly. Besides, the Excepter must
remember that this Text stands betwixt two remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Phaenomena, the Longevity of the Antediluvians
in the old World, and the appearance of the Rainbow
in the New. Both which were marks of a different
state of nature in the two Worlds.</p>
               <p>He further excepts against that perpetual Equinox
before the Flood,<note place="margin">p. 168.</note> for another Scripture-reason: <hi>Viz.</hi>
Because the Earth was curst before that time, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
he says, had not a perpetual Equinox. But
if that curse was supernatural, it might have its effect
in any position of the Earth. For God can make a
Land barren, if he think fit, in spite of the course of
Nature. And so he also must suppose it to have been
in this case. For, upon all suppositions, whether of a
perpetual Equinox, or no, the Earth is granted to have
been very fruitful at first: and so would have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
if that curse had not interven'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:50178:17"/>Lastly,<note place="margin">p. 169.</note> He makes that an argument, that the Air
was cold and intemperate in Paradise, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
no constant Equinox, <hi>because</hi> Adam <hi>and</hi> Eve <hi>made
themselves Aprons to cover their nakedness.</hi> So, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses,
Interpreters generally understand that it was to
<hi>cover their nakedness.</hi> But he will not allow that to
be the true sence, but says those Fig-leaves were to
keep them warm. And the other Interpretation of
<hi>covering their nakedness,</hi> he will not admit, for three
reasons. First because the Scripture, as he pretends,
does not declare it so. See, pray, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 7. Secondly,
<hi>What shame,</hi> says he, <hi>need there have been betwixt Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
and Wife?</hi> Thirdly, <hi>If it was modesty; when they
were innocent, they should have been more modest.</hi> Some
arguments answer themselves, and I do not think these
deserve a confutation.<note place="margin">p. 170.</note> But, he says, however God
made them <hi>Coats of Skins</hi> afterwards, and that was to
be a <hi>defence against cold.</hi> He must tell us in what Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
he supposes Paradise to have stood: and which
way, and how far, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were banisht from it.
When those things are determin'd, we shall know what
to judge of his argument, and of <hi>Coats of Skins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After <hi>Lastly,</hi> I expected no more: but he hath two
or three reasons after the <hi>Last.</hi> As first, he says, upon
our Hypothesis,<note place="margin">p. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>1.</note> one Hemisphere of the Globe must
have been unpeopled: because the Torrid Zone was
unpassable. And was not the Ocean as unpassable,
upon your Hypothesis? How got they into <hi>America?</hi>
and not only into <hi>America,</hi> but into all the Islands of
the Earth, that are remote from Continents. Will
you not allow us one Miracle, for your many? I'me
sure the Theorist never excluded the Ministery of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels?
and They could as easily carry them thorough
the Torrid Zone, as over the Ocean. But Secondly,
he says, There could be no Rains, to make the Flood,
if there was a perpetual Equinox. Were not those
rains that made the Flood, extraordinary, and out of
the course of Nature? you would give one angry
words that should deny it. Besides, the <hi>Flood-gates</hi> of
<hi>Heaven</hi> were open'd when the <hi>Great Deep</hi> was broken
up,<note place="margin">Eng. Theor. <hi>p.</hi> 99.</note> (<hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 11.) and no wonder the Disruption of the
Earth should cause some extraordinary Commotions
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50178:17"/>
in the air: and either compress the vapours, or stop
their usual course towards the Poles, and draw them
down in streams upon several parts of the Earth.
But the Excepter says, this could not be, because the
Theorist makes the rains fall before the disruption of
the Abyss. But he does not suppose the <hi>Cataracts of
Heaven</hi> to have been open'd before, which made the
grand rains. And how unfairly that passage of the
Theory is represented, we shall see hereafter in the
14<hi>th.</hi> Chapter.</p>
               <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">p. 176.</note> He concludes all with this remark: That
all sorts of Authors have disputed, in what season of
the Year the Deluge came, and in what season of the
Year the World began: therefore they thought there
were then different seasons of the Year. These di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes,
he confesses, did <hi>manifestly proceed from inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency,</hi>
or something worse: Because there could
not be any one season throughout all the Earth at
once. He might have added, unless upon the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the Theory, which makes an universal
Equinox at that time. And why may not that have
given occasion to the general belief, <hi>that the world
begun in the Spring?</hi> and when the true reason of the
Tradition was lost, they fell into those impertinent
questions, <hi>In what season of the Year the World began.</hi>
But however we do not depend upon the belief, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Ancients or the Moderns, as to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality:
for we know they had other notions of these
things than what the Theory proposes; otherwise it
would have been a needless work. But notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the general error, that Providence did preserve
some Traditions and Testimonies concerning that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Truth, we shall see in the next following discourse.</p>
               <p>So much for Scripture and Reasons. He now
comes to examine Authorities: Namely such Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
as are alledg'd by the Theorist, to shew that
there was a Tradition amongst the Ancients, of a
<hi>change that had been, as to the position of the Earth:</hi>
and consequently, as to the form and seasons of the
Year. The first Testimony that he excepts against is
that of <hi>Diogenes</hi> and <hi>Anaxagoras;</hi> who witness plainly,<note place="margin">p. 177.</note>
That there had been an <hi>Inclination</hi> of the Earth, or a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50178:18"/>
change of posture, since it was form'd and inhabited.
But the Excepter says they have not assign'd a true <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
cause,</hi> nor such as agrees with the Theory. The
second Testimony is that of <hi>Empedocles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 178.</note> which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
against, because he hath not given a good <hi>Efficient
Cause</hi> of that change.<note place="margin">p. 179.</note> The third witness is <hi>Leucippus:</hi>
against whom he makes the same exception, that he
does not assign the Causes a-right.<note place="margin">p. 180.</note> The fourth witness
is <hi>Democritus:</hi> whom he quarrels upon the same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
But is this a fair hearing of Witnesses? Or are
these just and legal grounds of rejecting their testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
as to matter of Fact, because they are unskilful in
giving the causes and reasons of that matter of Fact?
That is not requir'd in witneses: and they are often
impertinent when they attempt to do it. The Theorist
does not cite these Authors to learn of them the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
either Efficient or Final, of that <hi>Inclination,</hi> or
change of posture in the Earth, but only matter of
Fact. To let you see, that, according to their testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
there was a Tradition in that time, which
they took for true, concerning a change made in
the posture of the Earth. And this is all we require
from them. If you pretend to invalidate their testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
because they do not Philosophize well about
that change: That's as if you should deny that there
was such a War as the <hi>Peloponnesian</hi> war, because
the Historian hath not assigned the true causes and
reasons of it. Or as if a man should give you the
history of a Comet, that appear'd in such a year, was
of such a form, and took such a course in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens;
and you should deny there was any such Comet,
because the same Author had not given a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the generation of that Comet, nor of the
Causes of its form and motion. The exceptions made
against the testimonies of these Philosophers, seem to
me to be no less injudicious.</p>
               <p>After these Testimonies,<note place="margin">p. 181.</note> He makes three or four
remarks or reflections upon them. But they all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
either the time of this Change, or the Causes of it.
Neither of which the Theorist either engag'd or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to prove from these Witnesses.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:50178:18"/>There is still one Testimony behind,<note place="margin">p. 182.</note> which the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter
hath separated from the rest, that he might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
it singly. Tis another passage from <hi>Anaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,</hi>
which both notes this <hi>Inclination,</hi> and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of the Heavens and Earth before that Inclination.
But here the Excepter quarrels, first, with the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: because <hi>Ambrosius</hi> the Monk, would have it
to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> but without the Authority of any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript:
and, as <hi>Casaubon</hi> says, <hi>male.</hi> Then, he says, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobrandinus</hi>
translates it <hi>turbulentè,</hi> but gives no reason
for that translation, in his notes. Therefore he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
rest in this, but in the third place, he gives ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sence to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And if that will not please
you, he has still a fourth answer in reserve. I do not
like when a man shifts answers so often, 'tis a sign he
has no great confidence in any one. But let us have
his fourth answer, 'Tis this, That <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> was a
kind of heterodox Philosopher, and what he says is
not much to be heeded. These are the words of the
Excepter.<note place="margin">p. 184.</note> 
                  <hi>If this will not satisfie, I have one thing more
to offer. Grant that</hi> Anaxagoras <hi>should mean that very
Declination, which the Theory would have him, yet this
truly would contribute little towards the proof of the thing.
For he was a man as like to be Heterodox, as like to
broach and maintain false and groundless opinions, as any
of the learned Ancients.</hi> Had he made this exception
against this witness at first, it might have sav'd both
himself and us a great deal of pains. For we do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
if you can prove a witness to be <hi>persona infamis,</hi>
or <hi>non compos mentis,</hi> 'tis sufficient to invalidate his
Testimony.</p>
               <p>But this is a rude and groundless censure; Shall
that famous <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> that was call'd <hi>MENS,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
not be thought so much as <hi>mentis compos?</hi> nor
have credit enough for an honest witness? I am apt
to think, from those sentences, and those remains we
have left of him, that there was not a more consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
man amongst the Ancients, for nobleness of mind
and natural knowledg. I could bring the testimonies
of many ancient Authors, and of many Christian fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to clear his reputation, and place it above envy.
'Tis generally acknowledg'd, that he first introduc'd
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50178:19"/>
an intellectual principle, in the formation of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse:
to dispose and order confus'd matter. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<hi>Eusebius</hi> gives him this fair character,<note place="margin">Praep. Evan. l. 10. c. ult. p. 504. Col.</note> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>He first rectified the doctrine of
Principles: For he did not only discourse about the matter
or substance of the Vniverse, as other Philosophers: but
also of the cause and principle of its motion.</hi> And the
same Author,<note place="margin">ch. 14. p. 750.</note> in his 14<hi>th</hi> Book, repeats and enlarges
this character.</p>
               <p>I wonder, the Excepter, of all men, should lessen
the name of <hi>Anaxagoras.</hi> For, besides his Orthodoxy
as to the intellectual World: He was one that esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd
the notion of <hi>Vortices,</hi> in the Corporeal. As
you may see in <hi>Clem. Alexandrinus,</hi> and in <hi>Plato's Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Strom. 2. p. 364. Phaed. p. 99.</note>
And tho' the <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>Socrates,</hi> (who never
was a friend to natural Philosophy) both blame him
for it; yet the excepter, who is deservedly pleas'd with
that Systeme of <hi>Vortices,</hi> ought to have shew'd him
some favour and esteem for the sake of this doctrine.
Lastly, as to his moral temper; his contempt of the
World, and his love of contemplation; you have
many instances of it in the short story of his life in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertius.</hi>
And I shall always remember that excellent

               <p>But we are not to imagine, that all the opinions of

to us. Neither can we in reason or justice
believe, that they could be guilty of such absurd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as are sometimes fathered upon them. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter
instances in an extravagant assertion, (as the
story is told to us) ascrib'd to <hi>Anaxagoras:</hi> of a <hi>stone
that fell from the Sun.</hi> This cannot be literally true,
nor literally the opinion of <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> if he believ'd
<hi>Vortices;</hi> therefore methinks so witty a man as the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter,
and so well vers'd in the modern Philosophy,
should rather interpret this of the Incrustation of a
fixt Star, and its descent into the lower World: That
a Star fell from the Ethereal regions, and became an
Opake and Terrestrial Body. Especially seeing <hi>Diogenes,</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:50178:19"/>
as he says, supposes it a Star. Some things were aenig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically
spoken at first: and some things afterwards
so much corrupted, in passing thorough unskilful
hands, that we should be very injurious to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of those great Men, if we should suppose every
thing to have come so crudely from them, as it is now
deliver'd to us. And as to this Philosopher in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular;
As the <hi>Ionick</hi> Physiology, in my opinion, was
the most considerable amongst the Ancients; so there
was none, of that order, more considerable than <hi>Anax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agoras.</hi>
Whom, tho' you should suppose extravagant,
<hi>quoad hoc,</hi> that would not invalidate his testimony in
other things.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole matter, let us now summ up the
Evidence, and see what it will amount to. Here are
five or six Testimonies of considerable Philosophers:
<hi>Anaxagoras, Diogenes, Empedocles, Leucippus</hi> and <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus.</hi>
To which he might have added <hi>Plato,</hi> both in
his <hi>Politicus</hi> and <hi>Phaedo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Li. 2. c. 10. p. 274.</note> if he had pleas'd to have lookt
into the 2<hi>d.</hi> Edition of the <hi>Latin</hi> Theory. These Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
do all make mention of a change that hath
been in the posture of the Earth and the Heavens.
And tho' they differ in assigning causes, or other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
yet they all agree as to matter of Fact:
that there was such a thing, or, at least, a Tradition
of such a thing. And this is all that the Defendant
desir'd or intended to prove from them, as Witnesses
in this cause.</p>
               <p>To these <hi>Philosophers,</hi> he might have added the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
of the <hi>Poets,</hi> who may be admitted as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of a Tradition, though it be further questioned,
whether that Tradition be true or false. These Poets
when they speak of a <hi>Golden Age,</hi> or the <hi>Reign of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi>
tell us of a <hi>perpetual Spring,</hi> or a Year without
change of Seasons. This is expresly said by <hi>Ovid, Ver
erat Aeternum,</hi> &amp;c. And upon the expiration of the
Golden Age, he says,
<q>
                     <l>Iupiter Antiqui contraxit tempora Veris,</l>
                     <l>Perque Hyemes, Aestusque, &amp; inaequales Autumnos,</l>
                     <l>Et breve Ver, spatiis exegit quattuor annum.</l>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:50178:20"/>
                  <hi>Ovid</hi> liv'd in the time of our Saviour. And the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
it seems, was then a foot, and very express too.
<hi>Plato,</hi> who was much more ancient, hath said the same
thing, in his <hi>Politicus,</hi> concerning the <hi>Reign of Saturn.</hi>
And if we may have any regard to <hi>Mythology,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> Theor. Lat. li. 2. c. 10. in fine.</note> and
make <hi>Ianus</hi> the same with <hi>Noah,</hi> which is now an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
generally receiv'd: That power that is given
him by the Ancients, of <hi>changing Times and Seasons,</hi>
cannot be better expounded, than by that great change
of time, and of the Seasons of the Year, that happen'd
in the Days of <hi>Noah.</hi> Neither must we count it a meer
Fable, what is said by the Ancients, concerning the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitability
of the <hi>Torrid Zone:</hi> and yet that never
was, if the Earth was never in any other posture, than
what it is in now.</p>
               <p>Lastly, As the Philosophers and Poets are witnesses
of this Tradition, so many of the Christian Fathers
have given such a Character of <hi>Paradise,</hi> as cannot be
understood upon any other suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
than of a <hi>Perpetual Equinox.</hi>

               <p>We have now done with the examination of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses:
<hi>Philosophers, Poets, Iews,</hi> and <hi>Christians.</hi> From
all these we collect, That there was an opinion, or
Tradition, amongst the Ancients, of a change made in
the state of the Natural World, as to the diversity of
Seasons in the Year: And that this did arise from the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50178:20"/>
change of the posture of the Earth. Whether this
Opinion, or this Tradition, was <hi>de jure,</hi> as well as <hi>de
facto,</hi> is a question of another nature, that did not lie
before us at present. But the thing that was only
in debate in this Chapter, was matter of Fact, which
I think we have sufficiently prov'd.</p>
               <p>In the close of this Chapter, The Excepter makes
two Queries: still by way of objection to the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diluvian
Equinox.<note place="margin">p. 185.</note> The First is this, <hi>Supposing an Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox
in the beginning of the World, would it (in likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood)
have continued to the Flood.</hi> If you grant the
first part, I believe few will scruple the second. For
why should we suppose a change before there appear
any cause for it. He says, the Waters might possibly
have weigh'd more towards one Pole, than towards
another. But why the Waters more than the Air?
The Waters were not more rarified towards one Pole,
that towards another, no more than the Air was:
for which the Excepter had justly blam'd <hi>Leucippus</hi>
before.<note place="margin">p. 180.</note> But however, <hi>says He,</hi> that Earth would be
very unstable, because, in process of time, there would
be an empty space betwixt the Exterior Region of the
Earth, and the Abyss below. But that empty space
would be fill'd with such gross vapors, that it would
be little purer than water: and would stick to the
Earth much closer than its Atmosphere that is carried
about with it. We have no reason to change the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of the Earth, till we see some antecedent change
that may be a cause of it. And we see not any, till
the Earth broke. But then indeed, whether its po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
depended barely upon its <hi>Aequilibrium,</hi> or upon
its <hi>magnetisme,</hi> either, or both of them, when its parts
were thrown into another situation, might be chang'd.
For the parts of a ruine seldom lie in the same libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the Fabrick stood in. And as to the magnetisme
of the Earth, that would change, according as the
Parts, and Regions of the Earth chang'd their si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation.</p>
               <p>The second Query is this. Granting there was such
an Equinox in the first World,<note place="margin">p. 187.</note> 
                  <hi>Would not the natural
day, towards the later end of that World, have been longer,
than in the former periods of the same.</hi> Suppose this was
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50178:21"/>
true, which yet we have no reason to believe, That
the Days were longer towards the flood, than towards
the beginning of the World: why is this contrary to
Scripture?<note place="margin">p. 188.</note> He tells you how, in these words. <hi>That
the days just before the flood were of no unusual length,
is evident in the very story of the Flood; the duration of
which we find computed by Months, consisting of thirty days
a-piece. Whereas had days been grown longer, fewer of
them would have made a Month.</hi> This is a meer Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logisme,
or a meer blunder. For if thirty days were
to go to a Month, whether the days were longer or
shorter, there must be thirty of them; and the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
does not determine the length of the days. If
thirty circumgyrations of the Earth make a Month,
whether these circumgyrations are slow or swift, thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
are still thirty. But I suppose that which he would
have said, and which he had confusedly in his mind,
was this, That the <hi>Month</hi> would have been longer at
the Flood than it was before. <hi>Longer,</hi> I say, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of time, or duration in general, but not as to
number of days. And you could not cut off a slip
of one day, and tack it to the next, through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate
Night, to make an abridgment of the
whole. Therefore this Objection is grounded upon
a mistake, and ill reasoning, which is now sufficiently
detected.</p>

               <p>THIS Chapter is against the <hi>Oval Figure of the
first Earth:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 189.</note> which the Theorist had asserted, and
grounded upon a general motion of the Waters, forc'd
from the Equinoctial Parts towards the Polar. But
before we proceed to his Objections against this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
we must rectifie one Principle. The Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
seems to suppose, that Terrestrial Bodies have a
<hi>nitency inwards or downwards,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 190.</note> 
                  <hi>towards their Central point.</hi>
Whereas the Theorist supposes, that all Bodies moving
round, have, more or less, a nitency from the Center
of their motion: and that 'tis by an external force
that they are prest down, against their first inclination
or nitency.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:50178:21"/>This being premis'd, we proceed to his exceptions:
where his first and grand quarrel is about the use of
a word: whether the motion of the Water from the
middle of the Earth towards the Poles, can be call'd
<hi>defluxus.</hi> Seeing those Polar Parts, in this suppos'd
case, were as high, or higher than the Equinoctial. I
think we do not scruple to say, <hi>undae defluunt ad li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tora:</hi>
tho' the shores be as high, or higher than the
Surface of the Sea. For we often respect, as the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orist
did, the <hi>middle</hi> and the <hi>sides,</hi> in the use of that
word: And so, <hi>defluere è medio ad latera,</hi> is no more
than <hi>prolabi ad latera.</hi> But 'tis not worth the while
to contest about a word. Especially seeing 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
in the 2<hi>d.</hi> Edition of the Theory,<note place="margin">p. 186.</note> by adding
<hi>detrusione:</hi> but it would have spoil'd all this pedantry,
and all his little triumphs, if he had taken notice of
that Explication.</p>
               <p>Wherefore setting aside the <hi>word,</hi> Let us consider
his <hi>reasons</hi> against this motion of the Waters towards
the Poles: which, he says, could not be, because it
would have been an ascent, not a descent. We allow
and suppose that. But may not Waters ascend by
force and detrusion: when it is the easiest way they
can take to free themselves from that force, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe
in their motion? And this is the case we are
speaking to. They were impell'd to ascend, or recide
from the Center, and it was easier for them to ascend
laterally, than to ascend directly: upon an inclin'd
Plain, than upon a perpendicular one. Why then
should we not suppose that they took that course?
Methinks the Observator, who seems to be much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
in the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Philosophy, might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
this detrusion of the Waters towards the Poles
by the resistance of the superambient Air, as well as
their flowing towards and upon the shores, by the
pressure of the Air under the Moon. And if the Moon
continued always in the same place, or over the middle
of the Sea, that posture of the waters would be always
the same: though it be an ascent, both upon the Land
and into the Rivers. And this, methinks, is neither
contradiction, nor absurdity. But an Enemy, that is
little us'd to Victory, makes a great noise upon a small
advantage.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:50178:22"/>He proceeds now to show,<note place="margin">p. 195.</note> that it was improbable
that the Figure of the first Earth should be Oval, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
other considerations. As first, Because of its posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
which would be cross to the stream of the Air,
that turns it round, or carries it about the Sun. As
a Ship, he says, that stands side-ways against a stream,
cannot sail. But if that Ship was to turn round upon
her Axis, as a Mill-wheel, and as the Earth does, what
posture more likely to have such an effect, than to
stand cross to the stream that turns it? And the stream
would take more hold of an Oblong-Body, than of a
round. Then, as to its annual course, which he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that's nothing, but so many Circumvolutions:
for in turning round it is also progressive, as a Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in rowling a Garden. And three-hundred sixty-five
circumgyrations compleat its annual course. So
that this argument turns wholly against him, and does
rather confirm the Oval Figure of the Earth.</p>
               <p>His Second Argument against the Oval Figure of
the First Earth, is the Spherical Figure of the present
Earth. And how does he prove that? First from Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities:
<hi>Anaximander, Pythagoras,</hi> and <hi>Parmenides</hi>
thought so. But how does he prove that their assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Earth to be <hi>round,</hi> was not meant in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to its being <hi>Plain:</hi> as the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> and the
Vulgar would have it? That was the Question <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
promis'd himself to be resolv'd in by <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plat. in Phaed.</note>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Whether the Earth
was flat, or round.</hi> And 'tis likely the dispute was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
understood in that sence. However the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orist
hath alledg'd many more Authorities than these,
in favour of the Oval Figure of the Earth. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<hi>Empedocles</hi> in particular, and those whom <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>
mentions in general, the Philosophy of <hi>Orpheus,</hi>
the <hi>Phoenician, Aegyptian,</hi> and <hi>Persian Philosophers</hi> did
all compare the Earth to an Egg: with respect to its
Oval external form, as well as internal composition.
These you may see fully set down in the <hi>Theory:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lat. Theor li. 2. c. 10.</note> And
it had been fair in the Excepter to have taken some
notice of them, if he would contend in that way of
Authorities. But he has thought fit rather to pass
them over wholly in silence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:50178:22"/>His reasons to prove the figure of the present Earth
to be Spherical and not Oval,<note place="margin">p. 197.</note> are taken, first, from
the Conical figure, of the shadow of the Earth, cast
upon the Moon. But that cannot make a difference,
sensible to us at this distance, whether the Body that
cast the shadow was exactly Spherical or Oval. His
Second reason is <hi>from the place of the waters:</hi> which,
he says, would all retire from the Poles to the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
if the Polar parts were higher. But this has been
answer'd before. The same cause that drive the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
thither, would make them keep there. As we
should have a perpetual Flood, if the Moon was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in our Meridian. And whereas he suggests, that
by this means the Sea should be shallowest under the
Poles: which, he says, is against experience. We tell
him just the contrary, That, according to our Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,
the Sea should be deepest towards the Poles;
which agrees with experience. That the Sea should
be deepest under the Poles,<note place="margin">p. 186.</note> if it was of an Oval form,
he may see plainly by his own Scheme, or by the
Theory Scheme:<note place="margin">Theor. Lat. li. 2. c. 5.</note> So that if his observation be true, of
an extraordinary depth of the Ocean in those parts, it
confirms our suspition, that the Sea continues still O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val.
Lastly,<note place="margin">p. 198.</note> he urges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If this Earth was Oval, Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
towards the Poles would be extremely difficult,
if not impossible, because upon an ascent. But if there
be a continual draught of Waters from the Equator
towards the Poles, this will balance the difficulty, and
be Equivalent to a gentle Tide, that carries Ships
into the mouth of a River, though upon a gradual
ascent.</p>
               <p>Thus much we have said in complacency to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter.
For the Theorist was not oblig'd to say any
thing, in defence of the Oval form of the present Earth,
seeing he had no where asserted it. It not being pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
as to what evidence we have yet, to determine
in what order the Earth fell, and in what posture the
ruines lay after their fall. But however, to speak my
mind freely upon this occasion, I am inclinable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that the Earth is still Oval or Oblong. What
things the Antitheorist hath suggested, will not decide
the controversie: nor, it may be, any natural history,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50178:23"/>
nor any of those observations, that we have already.
The surface of the Sea lies more regular than that of
the Land, and therefore I should think, that obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
made there, would have the best effect. I
should particularly recommend these two: First,
that they would observe towards the Poles, whether
the Sun rise and set, according to the rules of a true
Globe, or of a Body exactly Spherical. Secondly, that
they would observe whether the degrees of latitude
are of equal extent in all the parts of a Meridian; that
is, if the quantity of sea or land that answers to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in the heavens, be of equal extent towards the
Equator as towards the Poles. These two observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
would go the nearest of any, I know, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
whether the figure of the Earth be truly sphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
or oblong.</p>

               <p>THIS Chapter is concerning the <hi>Original of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi>
and that they were befoe the Flood, or
from the beginning. Which the Excepter endeavours
to prove from Scripture: not directly, but because
mention is made of them in the same places where the
beginning of the Earth is mentioned,<note place="margin">p. 201.</note> as <hi>Psal.</hi> 90. 1, 2.
and <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 25. therefore they must be co-eval and
contemporary. We have, I think, noted before, that
things are not always Synchronal that are mention'd
together in Scripture. The Style of Scripture is not
so accurate, as not to speak of things in the same place,
that are to be referr'd to different times. Otherwise
we must suppose the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and of
the <hi>World,</hi> to have been intended for the same time:
seeing our Saviour joyns them in the same discourse,
(<hi>Matt.</hi> 24.) without any distinction of time. Or
with such a distinction, as rather signifies an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
succession (<hi>ver.</hi> 29.) than so great a distance as
we now find to be betwixt the destruction of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
and the end of the World. Greater than that,
betwixt the Beginning and the Flood. So in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
sometimes, in the same discourse, one part is to
be referr'd to the first coming of our Saviour, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50178:23"/>
part to the second:<note place="margin">Isa. 9. 6, 7. Isa. 9. 1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Luk. 1. 31, 32, 33.</note> without making any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of time, but what is to be gathered from the
sence. Neither is there any incongruity in the sence,
or in the tenour of the words, if those expressions in
the Psalmist be referr'd to different times. God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isted
<hi>before the Mountains were brought forth, and the
Earth and the World were made.</hi> This is certainly true,
whether you take it of the same or different times.
And if you take it of different times, 'tis a way of
speaking we often use. As suppose a man should say
concerning the Antiquity of <hi>Troy,</hi> that it existed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> that does not necessarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
that <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi> were built at the same
time; but only that <hi>Troy</hi> was before them both. And
so this of the Psalmist may be very well thus exprest,
by a gradation from a lower Epocha to an higher.
Then as for that place in <hi>Prov. ch.</hi> 8. It would be very
hard to reduce all those things that are mentioned
there, (from <hi>ver.</hi> 22. to the 30.) to the same time of
existence; and there is no necessity from the words
that they should be so understood. The design and
intention of the Holy Ghost is plain in both these
places: In the one to set out the Eternity of God, and
in the other, of the <hi>Logos</hi> in particular. And this is
done by shewing their pre-existence to this Earth, and
to all its greatest and most remarkable parts.</p>
               <p>He mentions also, <hi>Deut.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 202.</note> 33. 15. where the Hills are
call'd <hi>Lasting,</hi> and the Mountains <hi>Ancient.</hi> And <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were before the Flood.</hi> This is a hard conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
The River <hi>Kishon</hi> is call'd the <hi>ancient</hi> River.
<hi>Iudg.</hi> 5. 21. but I do not therefore think it necessary,
that that brook should have been before the Flood.
Things may very well deserve that character of <hi>Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
or <hi>Ancient,</hi> though they be of less antiquity than
the Deluge. If one should say the <hi>lasting Pyramids,</hi>
and <hi>ancient Babylon,</hi> none could blame the expression,
nor yet think that they were therefore from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
of the World.</p>
               <p>After these allegations from Scripture,<note place="margin">p. 205.</note> He descends
to a natural argument, taken from the <hi>mountains in
the Moon.</hi> Which, he says, are much higher than the
mountains upon the Earth: and therefore, seeing her
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50178:24"/>
Body is less, they could not be made by a Dissolution
of that Planet, as these of the Earth are said to have
been. Though we are not bound to answer for the
Mountains in the Moon, yet however 'tis easie to see
that this is no good argument. For, besides that the
Orb there might be more thick, all ruines do not fall
alike. They may fall double, or in ridges and arches, or
in steep piles, some more than others, and so stand at a
greater height. And we have reason to believe that
those in the Moon fell otherwise than those of the
Earth: because we do not see her turn round: nor
can we ever get a sight of her back-side, that we might
better judge of the shapes of her whole Body.</p>
               <p>From this Natural Argument,<note place="margin">p. 206.</note> he proceeds to an
Historical Argument, taken from the <hi>Talmudists</hi> and
<hi>Iosephus.</hi> The <hi>Talmudists</hi> say, that <hi>many Giants sav'd
themselves from the Flood upon Mount Sion.</hi> But this, the
Excepter confesses, is <hi>wholly fabulous.</hi> What need it
then be mention'd as an argument? Then he says, <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus</hi>
reports that <hi>many sav'd themselves from the flood
upon the mountain Baris in Armenia.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 207.</note> But this also, he
says, is <hi>false in the gross,</hi> and a <hi>formal fiction.</hi> Why
then, say I, is it brought in as an argument? Lastly, he
quotes a passage out of <hi>Plato,</hi> who says, when the <hi>gods
shall drown the Earth, the Herdsmen and Shepherds shall
save themselves upon mountains.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ibid.</note> And this the Excepter
calls a <hi>piece of confus'd forgery.</hi> Why then, say I still,
is it alledg'd as an argument against the Theory? But
however, says the Excepter, these things argue that
many thought there were mountains before the Flood.
But did the Theorist ever deny that it was the
vulgar and common opinion? Therefore such alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
as these, may be of some use to shew reading,
but of no effect at all to confute the Theory.</p>
               <p>Yet the Excepter is not content with these stories,
but he must needs add a fourth. Which,<note place="margin">p. 208.</note> he says, is a
<hi>plain intimation that there were mountains in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the World.</hi> Take his own words for the story
and the application of it. <hi>I will only add that Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
story which is told of</hi> Adam; <hi>namely, how that after
his fall, and when he repented of his Sin, he bewailed it
for several hundreds of years upon the mountains of India.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50178:24"/>
Another plain intimation that THERE WERE MOVN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAINS</hi>
in the beginning of the World. This is a
plain intimation indeed, that those that made this
Fable, thought there were mountains then: but is it a
proof that there really was so? as you seem to infer.
Does the Excepter really believe that <hi>Adam</hi> wander'd
an hundred years upon the mountains of <hi>India?</hi> If
the matter of fact be false, the supposition it proceeds
upon may as well be false. And he does not so much
as cite an Author here, for the one or the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We are now come to the main point,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 208, 209, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>a new Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis
concerning the</hi> original of Mountains, <hi>which the
Excepter hath vouchsafed to make for us. And in
short, it is this. When the Waters were drain'd off the
Land, on the</hi> 3d <hi>day, while it was moist and full of
Vapours, the</hi> Sun <hi>by his heat, made the Earth heave
and rise up in many places, which thereupon became
Mountains. But lest we mistake or misrepresent the
Author's sence, we will give it in his own words.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 209.</note> Now
the Earth by this collection of the waters into one place,
being freed from the load and pressure of them, and laid
open to the Sun; the moisture within, by the heat of his
beams, might quickly be tur<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'d into Vapours. And these
Vapours being still increased by the continued rarifying
warmth from above, at length they wanted space wherein to
expand or dilate themselves. And at last not enduring
the confinement they felt, by degrees heaved up the Earth
above; somewhat after the manner that leaven does Dough,
when it is laid by a sire; but much more forcibly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evenly.
And lifting it up thus in numberless places, and
in several quantities, and in various figures; Mountains
were made of all shapes and sizes. <hi>Whose origine and
properties, he says, upon this Hypothesis,</hi> will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious,
or at least intelligible, to thinking and Philosophick
Minds.</p>
               <p>I must confess I am none of those <hi>Thinking and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophick
Minds,</hi> to whom this is either obvious or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible.
For there seem to me, to be a great many
palpable defects or oversights in this new Hypothesis.
Whereof this is one of the grossest, that he supposes
the Sun, by his heat, the 3<hi>d</hi> Day to have raised these
Mountains upon the Earth; whereas the Sun was not
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50178:25"/>
created till the 4<hi>th.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 51. the 4th. day was the first day of the Sun's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence.</note> Day. So that it had this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werful
effect, it seems, one day before it came into
Being.</p>
               <p>But suppose the Sun had then existed: This is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
effect for the Sun to perform, in so short a
time, and with so little force. The greatest part of
that Day was spent in draining the Waters from off
the Land. Which had a long way to go, from some
Inland Countries, to reach the Sea, or their common
receptacle.<note place="margin">p. 209.</note> And, he says, without an extraordinary
power, <hi>perhaps they could not have been drained off the
Earth in one Day.</hi> Let us then allow, at least, half a
Day, for clearing the Ground; so the Sun might begin
his work about Noon: And before Night, he had rais'd
all the Mountains of one Hemisphere. It will require
a strong Philosophick Faith, to believe this could be
all done by the action of the Sun, and in so short a
time. Besides we must consider, that the Sun, by
Noon, had past all the Eastern Countries, yet cover'd
with Water, or not well drain'd: So that after they
were dry'd, he could only look back upon them, with
faint and declining rayes. Yet the Mountains of the
East are as great and considerable as else-where. But
there is still another great difficulty in the case, as to
the Northern and Southern Mountains of the Earth:
for they lie quite out of the road of the Sun: being
far remov'd towards either Pole; where, by reason of
his distance and obliquity, his beams have little force.
How would he heave up the <hi>Riphaean</hi> Mountains, those
vast heaps of Stone and Earth, that lie so far to the
North? You see what observations the Excepter hath
made (<hi>p.</hi> 119, 120.) concerning the cold of those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries:
And it falls out very untowardly for this new
Hypothesis, that the Northern parts of the Earth, as
<hi>Norway, Sweedland, Island, Scythia, Sarmathia,</hi> &amp;c. should
be such Mountainous and Rocky Countries; where
he had before declar'd the Sun had so little force. And
indeed, according to his Scheme, all the great Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of the Earth should have been under the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
or, at least, betwixt the Tropicks.</p>
               <p>But to examine a little the manner and method of
this great Action: and what kind of Bodies these new
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50178:25"/>
Mountains would be. Either the Sun drew up only
the surface and outward skin of the Earth, as Cupping-glasses
raise Blisters. Or his beams penetrated deep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Earth, and heaved up the substance of it, as Moles
cast up mole-hills. If you take the first method, these
superficial Mountains would be nothing but so many
baggs of Wind: and not at all answerable to those
huge masses of Earth and stone, whereof our moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
consist. And if you take the second method,
and suppose them pusht out of the solid Earth, and
thrown up into the air, imagine then how deep these
raies of the Sun must have penetrated in a few hours
time, and what strength they must have had, to agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the vapours to that degree, that they should be
able to do such prodigies as these. Several Mountains,
upon a moderate computation, are a mile high from
the level of the Earth. So that it was necessary that
the beams of the Sun should penetrate, at least, a mile
deep, in so short a time: and there loosen and rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the vapours, and then tear up by the roots vast
loads and extents of ground, and heave them a mile
high into the open air; and all this in less than half
a day. Such things surely are beyond all imagination:
and so extravagant, that one cannot, in conscience,
offer them to the belief of a man. Can we think that
the Sun, who is two or three hours in licking up the
Dew from the grass, in a <hi>May-</hi> morning: should be
able, in as many more hours, to suck the <hi>Alps</hi> and <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reneans</hi>
out of the bowels of the Earth? And not to
spend all his force upon them neither. For he would
have as much work in other Countries. To raise up
<hi>Taurus,</hi> for instance, and <hi>Imaus,</hi> and frozen <hi>Caucasus</hi> in
<hi>Asia.</hi> And the mighty <hi>Atlas</hi> and the <hi>Mountains</hi> of the
<hi>Moon</hi> in <hi>Africk.</hi> Besides the <hi>Andes</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> which,
they say, far exceed all the Mountains of our Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.
One would be apt to think, that this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
never see the face of a Mountainous Country.
For he writes of them, as if he had taken his Idea of
Mountains, and the great ridges of Mountains, upon
the Earth, from the <hi>Devil's Ditch,</hi> and <hi>Hogmagog Hills.</hi>
And he raises them faster than Mushromes, out of the
ground. If the New-born Sun, at his first appearance,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50178:26"/>
could make such great havock, and so great changes,
upon the face of the Earth, what hath he been doing
ever since? we never heard, nor read, of a Mountain,
since the memory of Man, rais'd by the heat of the
Sun. We may therefore enquire in the last place,</p>
               <p>Why have we no Mountains made now by the
same causes? We have no reason to believe, that the
heat or strength of the Sun is lessen'd since that time,
why then does it not produce like effects? But I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
he hath an answer for this. Namely, that the
moisture of the first Earth, when it was new-drain'd
and marshy, contributed much to this effect: which
now its driness hinders. But besides, that the driness
of the Earth should rather give an advantage, by the
collection of Vapours within its Cavities: However
we might expect, according to this reason, that all our
drain'd Fenns and marshy grounds should presently be
rais'd into Mountains. Whereas we see them all to
continue arrand Plains, as they were before. But if
you think these are too little spots of ground to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a strong influence from the Sun, take <hi>Aegypt</hi> for
an instance. That's capacious enough, and it's over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow'd
every Year, and by that means made soft and
moist to your mind, as the new Earth when it rise
from under the Abyss. Why then is not <hi>Aegypt</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into Mountains, after the inundation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement
of <hi>Nile?</hi> I do not see any qualification a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wanting
according to the Excepter's Hypothesis: <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi>
hath a moist Soil and a strong Sun; much stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than the <hi>Alpes</hi> or <hi>Pyreneans</hi> have: and yet it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
one of the plainest Countries upon the Earth.
But there is still a greater instance behind against this
Hypothesis, than any of the former: And that is, of
the whole Earth after the Deluge: when it had been
overflow'd a second time by the Abyss; upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement
of those Waters it would be much what in
the same condition as to moisture, that it was in the
3<hi>d.</hi> Day, when it first became dry Land. Why then
should not the same effect follow again, by the heat
of the Sun: And as many new Mountains be rais'd
upon this second draining of the Earth, as upon the
first? These are plain and obvious Instances, and as
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50178:26"/>
plainly unanswerable. And the whole Hypothesis,
which this Vertuoso hath propos'd concerning the
<hi>Origine</hi> of Mountains, is such an heap of Incredibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and things inconsistent one with another, that
I'me afraid I shall be thought to have spent too much
time in confutation of it.</p>
               <p>In the conclusion of this Chapter,<note place="margin">p. 215.</note> he hath an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to prove that there were Mountains before the
Flood, <hi>because there were Metals:</hi> which are commonly
found about the Roots of Mountains. But the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist,
he says, <hi>to shun this great inconvenience, fairly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
to the abolishing of metals out of the first state of
nature.</hi> Yet he's hard put to it, to prove that the
Theorist hath any where asserted, whatsoever he
thought, that there were no Metals then. The first
Citation he produces, only recites the opinion of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and says,<note place="margin">p. 216.</note> he <hi>thinks they do not want their reasons.</hi>
Of the two other Citations out of the Preface, the
First does not reach home, making no mention of
Metals. And the Second is wholly misconstrued, and
perverted to a sence quite contrary to what the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
intended, or the Context will bear. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Theorist appears doubtful whether there were
Metals, or no, in the First World: and upon this
doubt the Excepter lays this heavy charge. <hi>Thus the
Fidelity of</hi> Moses <hi>is assaulted,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 215. li. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>and another intolerable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
put upon the HOLY GHOST. For, do not both
inform us, that the City</hi> Enoch <hi>was built, and the Ark pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
before the Flood? But how could either be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Iron-tools?</hi> But does either <hi>Moses,</hi> or the Holy Ghost
tell us, that there were Iron-tools, in building that
City, or the Ark? If they do not, we onely affront
the consequence, which the Excepter draws from the
words, and not the Authors of them. By what divine
authority does the Animadverter assert, that there was
Iron, or Iron-tools, in building this City, or that Ark?
I'me sure Scripture does not mention either, upon
those occasions.<note place="margin">Gen. 6. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> And seeing it mentions onely <hi>Gopher
Wood</hi> and <hi>Pitch</hi> for the building of the Ark, 'tis a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
rather, that there were no other Materials
us'd. And as to the City, 'tis true, if he fancy the
City which <hi>Enoch</hi> built, to have been like <hi>Paris,</hi> or
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50178:27"/>
                  <hi>London,</hi> he has reason to imagine, that they had Iron-tools
to make it. But suppose it was a number of
Cottages, made of Branches of Trees, of Osiers and
Bulrushes, (and what needed they
any other House, when the Air was
so temperate) or, if you will,<note n="*" place="margin">Per ludibrium rogant nasuti homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, unde Architectos &amp; Opifices con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duxerit Cain ad urbem extruendam; Nos vicissim ab illis quaerimus, quo au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thore credant Vrbem ex quadratis la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidibus fuisse extructam: &amp; magno artificio, multisque sumptibus, &amp; longi temporis operâ, aedificium hoc consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisse.

Mud-walls, and a Roof of Straw:
with a Fence about it to keep out
Beasts: there would be no such ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of Iron-tools. Consider, pray,
how long the World was without
knowing the use of Iron, in several
parts of it, as in the North, and in <hi>America:</hi> and yet
they had Houses and Cities after their fashion. For
the Northern Countries you may see <hi>Olaus Magnus,
li. 12. c.</hi> 13. For <hi>America, Pet. Martyr, Dec.</hi> 1. But the
Excepter will save you your pains, as to the <hi>Indians,</hi>
for he says himself in another place, that they had no
Instruments of Iron,<note place="margin">p. 250.</note> when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> came amongst
them. And if in those late Ages of the World, they
were still without the use of Iron, or Iron-tools, we
have less reason to believe that the Children of <hi>Cain</hi>
had them four or five thousand years before.</p>
               <p>It is also worthy our Consideration, how many
things must have been done, before they could come
at these Iron-tools. How came the Children of <hi>Cain</hi>
to dig into the Earth, I know not to what depth, to
seek for a thing they had never heard of before?
when it was so difficult to dig into the Earth without
such Tools: more difficult, methinks, than to build an
House without them. But suppose they did this, we
know not how; and, amongst many other Stones, or
Earths, found that which we call Iron-ore: How did
they know the nature and use of it? Or, if they guess'd
at that, how did they know the way and manner of
preparing it? By Fornaces, Wind-forges, and Smelting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Mills.
These would be as hard to make or build,
without Iron-tools, as dwelling Houses. And when
they had got a Lump of Iron, till they knew how to
temper it, they could not make Tools of it still. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<hi>Cain</hi>'s Children had an Inspiration from Heaven, I
do not see how they could discover all these things,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50178:27"/>
in so short a time. And this is only to make good
what the Theorist said, that such an Hypothesis <hi>does
not want its reasons.</hi> And as to <hi>Tubal-cain,</hi> let those
that positively assert that there was no Iron in the
First World, tell us in what sence that place is to be
understood. For, I believe, Iron or Brass is not once
mention'd in all the Theory.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="11" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XI.</head>
               <p>THIS Chapter is to prove that the <hi>Sea was open</hi>
before the Deluge. 'Tis something barren of
Philosophical arguments, but we will begin with such
as it has, which are taken from this Topick, <hi>That the
Fishes could not live in our Abyss:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 224.</note> and that for three
reasons. First, because it was too dark. 2<hi>dly.</hi> too
close, and 3<hi>dly.</hi> too cold. As for coldness, methinks
he might have left that out, unless he suppose that
there are no fish in the frozen Seas, towards the
North and South: which is against all sence and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience:
for cold countreys abound most in fish. And
according to reason, there would be more danger of
too much warmth, in those subterraneous waters, than
of too much cold, in respect of the Fishes.</p>
               <p>Then as to darkness and closeness, this minds me
of the saying of <hi>Maimonides: That no man</hi> ever would
believe, that a child could live so many months, shut
up in its Mothers Belly, if he never had seen the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of it. There's closeness and darkness in the
highest degree: and in Animals, that, as soon as born,
cannot live without respiration. Whereas Fishes, of
all creatures, have the least need of Respiration, if they
have any. And as for <hi>darkness,</hi> how many subterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Lakes have we still, wherein Fishes live? And we
can scarce suppose the Main and fathomless Ocean to
have light to the bottom: at least when it is troubled
or tempestuous. How the Eyes of fish are, or might
be form'd or conform'd, we cannot tell, but we
see they feed and prey on the night time, and take
baits as greedily as on the day. But it is likely they
were less active and agile in that Abyss, than they are
now; Their life was more sluggish then, and their
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50178:28"/>
motions more slow.<note place="margin">Iob 38. 8.</note> As being still in that <hi>womb</hi> of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that was broke up at the Deluge. And as to
Air, they would have enough for their imperfect way
of breathing in that state. But if they have a more
perfect now, which is still a question: They might
have some passages, in their body, open'd, (at the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of the Abyss) when they were born into the
light and free air, which were not open'd before. As
we see in Infants, upon their birth, a new passage is
made into their lungs, and a new circulation of the
bloud, which before took another course.</p>
               <p>So much for pretended reasons and Philosophy.
The rest of this long Chapter is spent either in conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
made from Scripture, or in a prolix discourse
about Rain. As to Scripture, He makes this the first
objection,<note place="margin">p. 219, 220.</note> that, whereas <hi>Adam</hi> had a dominion given
him over the fish of the Sea, it could have no effect,
if they were enclosed in the Abyss. <hi>Adam</hi> had no more
dominion given him over the fish of the Sea, than over
the fowls of the Air: which he could not come at,
or seize at his pleasure, unless he could fly into the
air after them. <hi>Adam</hi> was made Lord of all Animals
upon this Earth, and had a right to use them for his
conveniency, when they came into his power. But I
do not believe that <hi>Adam</hi> was made stronger than a
Lyon, nor could master the Leviathan, or command
him to the shore. He had a right however, and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
to dispose of all creatures for their use and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
whensoever, upon occasion offered, they fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their power.</p>
               <p>Next he says,<note place="margin">p. 225, 226.</note> The Waters were gather'd into one
place, and a Firmament was made to divide the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
from the Waters. Well, allow this, tell us then
what was that Firmament.<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 17.</note> For it is said there, that
God set the Sun, Moon, and Stars, in the Fiamament.
Therefore you can argue nothing from this, unless you
suppose Supercelestial Waters: which, when you have
prov'd, we will give you an account of the Subcele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial,
and of the Subterraneous. And here the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter
cites some things from the Theory, that are not
in the second Edition, and therefore the Theorist is
not concern'd to answer them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:50178:28"/>Lastly, The Excepter comes to his long Harangue
in commendation of the <hi>Clouds</hi> and of <hi>Rain:</hi> which
takes up a great part of this Chapter. In his Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium
he makes this Complement to the Clouds.<note place="margin">p. 234.</note> 
                  <hi>Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they mount up and fly aloft, as if they forgat, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
the meanness of their Origin. Sometimes again they
sink and stoop so low, as if they repented of their former proud
aspirings, and did remorseful humble penance for their
high presumption. And though I may not say they weep to
expiate their arrogance, or kiss the earth with bedewed
cheeks in token of their penitence; yet they often prostrate
in the dust, and sweep the lowest grounds of all, with their
misty foggy trains. One while they,</hi> &amp;c. This Harangue
about the Clouds and Rain, is pursued for fourteen
or fifteen pages, and, with submission to better judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
I take it to be a Countrey-Sermon, about the
<hi>usefulness of Rain.</hi> And, I believe, whosoever reads it,
will, both from its matter and form, be of the same
opinion. I do not speak this in derogation to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
but he would have done better, methinks, to
have printed it in a pamphlet by it self; there being
no occasion for it in this Theory.</p>
               <p>Towards the conclusion of the Chapter,<note place="margin">p. 246.</note> He answers
an objection made by the Theorist against the supposed
Islands and Continents in the First Earth. Namely, <hi>That
it would render the propagation of mankind difficult, into
those broken parts of the World.</hi> And the many imperfect
shifting answers which the Excepter gives, or conjectures
without authority, do but confirm the objection of
the Theorist, or make his words true, <hi>quod Res esset
difficilis explicatu.</hi> Which is all that the Theorist said
upon that Subject.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XII.</head>
               <p>THIS is a short Chapter, and will be soon dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd.
'Tis to prove that the <hi>Rainbow was
before the Flood.</hi> And notwithstanding that, a good
sign that there should never be a Flood again. This
is to me a Paradox, but he confirms it by a greater
Paradox: for he says, God might as well (as to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficancy,
or authenticalness) <hi>have appointed the Sun, as
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50178:29"/>
the Rainbow, for a sign that there never should have been
another Flood.</hi> So that if God had said to <hi>Noah,</hi> I do
assure thee there shall never be a second Deluge, and
for a sign of this, <hi>Behold I set the Sun in the Firmament:</hi>
This would have done as well, he says, as the Rainbow.
That is, in my judgment, it would have done nothing
at all, more than the bare promise. And if it had
done no more than the bare promise, it was superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
Therefore if the Rainbow was no more than
the Sun would have been, it was a superfluous sign.
They to whom these two signs are of equal signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy
and effect, lye without the reach of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,
and I am very willing to indulge them their
own opinions.<note place="margin">p. 257.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But he says, <hi>God sometimes has made things to be signs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that are common and usual. Thus the fruit of a Tree grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Paradise, was made a sign of man's Immortality.</hi> But
how does it appear that this was a common Tree: or
that it was given to <hi>Adam</hi> as a sign that he should be
Immortal?<note place="margin">2 Kings 13. 17.</note> neither of these appear from Scripture.
Secondly, he says, <hi>Shooting with bow and arrows upon the
ground, was made a sign to</hi> Joash <hi>of his prevailing against
the Syrians.</hi> This was only a command to make war
against <hi>Syria,</hi> and a Prophecy of success; both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
in a Symbolical or Hieroglyphical way. The
command was signified by bidding the King shoot
an arrow, which was the sign of War. And the sign
of Victory or of divine assistance, was the Prophets
strengthening the King's hands to draw the Bow. This
is nothing as to a sign given in Nature, or from the
Natural World, in confirmation of a Divine Promise:
which is the thing we are only to consider.</p>
               <p>All the rest of this Chapter is lax discourse without
proof. And as to the significancy of the Rainbow,
upon supposition that it was a New Appearance: And
its insignificancy upon supposition that it was an Old
Appearance,<note place="margin">Eng. Theor. book 2. ch. 5.</note> we have spoken so fully in the Theory it
self, that it would be needless here to make any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

               <head>CHAP. XIII.</head>
               <p>THIS Chapter is concerning <hi>Paradise;</hi> But our
Author fairly baulks all the difficulties in that
Doctrine, and contents himself with a few generals,
which every body knows. The Doctrine of Paradise
consists chiefly of two parts; the site or place of it:
and the state or properties of it. As to the first, If
the Excepter wou'd have confuted the Theory, he
should have set down the Conclusions that are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
by the Theory,<note place="margin">Eng. Theor. book 2. ch. 7.</note> concerning the place of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
which are these; First, The place of Paradise can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be determin'd by Scripture only. Neither the
word <hi>Mekeddem, (Gen.</hi> 2. 8.) nor the four Rivers men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
there, make the place of it defineable. Secondly,
The place of Paradise cannot be determin'd by the
Theory. Seeing then neither Scripture, nor Reason de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the place of Paradise, if we will determine it,
it must be by Antiquity. And if we appeal to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
in this case, we shall find, first, that it was not
in <hi>Mesopotamia.</hi> Secondly, that according to the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of Votes, both amongst the Heathen and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Authors, it was plac'd in the other Hemisphere.
And this is all the Theory says upon that Point. As
you may see <hi>Eng. Theor. Book 2. ch.</hi> 7. and <hi>Lat. Theor.</hi>
2<hi>d. Edit. p. 194. &amp; p.</hi> 214, 215. Wherefore if the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverter
would undertake to confute the Theory
in this Point, he should have confuted those four Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.
But he slips over these, and gives us only
a Paraphrase upon some Verses in the 2<hi>d.</hi> and 3<hi>d.
Chap.</hi> of <hi>Gen.</hi> which says little to this purpose,<note place="margin">p. 265.</note> and
yet more than it proves.</p>
               <p>In the Second place, As to the state and properties
of Paradise, or the Antediluvian world; <hi>The longevity
of the Antediluvians</hi> is the thing he insists upon. But
this he handles so loosely,<note place="margin">p. 273.</note> that in the conclusion of
his discourse, one cannot tell whether he affirms it, or
denies it. This Sceptical humour of the Excepter hath
been taken notice of before, and 'tis continued in this
Chapter, where there is little or nothing positively
determin'd. The Theorist, on the contrary, expresly
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50178:30"/>
affirms the Longevity of the Antediluvians, and gives
these reasons for his assertion. First, because all the
Lives, and all the Generations recorded in Scripture,
before the Flood, from Father to Son, in a Line of
sixteen hundred years, are longeval. Of six, seven,
eight, nine hundred years a-piece. Secondly, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Barbarian,</hi> have attested the same
thing,<note place="margin">See the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of both. <hi>Eng. Theor.</hi> p. 220.</note> and recorded the Tradition. Thirdly, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations
recorded in Scripture after the Flood, as they
exceed the term of succeeding Ages, so they decline
by degrees from the Antediluvian Longevity. Lastly,
<hi>Iacob</hi> complains of the shortness of his life, and few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his days, in comparison of his Forefathers, when
he had liv'd one hundred and thirty years;<note place="margin">Gen. 47. 9.</note> which
had been a groundless complaint, if his Ancestors had
not lived much longer.</p>
               <p>These two last reasons the Excepter has not thought
fit to take notice of. And, in answer to the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
he hath onely the usual subterfuges. As, that
the long lives of the Antediluvian Patriarchs was a
thing extraordinary and providential: confin'd to
their Persons; not of a general extent, nor according
to the course of Nature. But how does this appear?
It must be made out, either by Scripture or Reason.
Scripture makes no distinction, nor exception of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in this case; All, whereof it hath left any account,
as to term of life, are declar'd to have liv'd several
hundreds of years. And why should we not conclude
the same thing concerning the rest? Then as to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
you cannot suppose Longevity, in that World, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
reason or nature, unless you first suppose the
form and constitution of that World to have been the
same with the present: Which is to beg the Question.
Admitting that form and constitution of the first Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
and Earth, which the Theory hath given, Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gevity
will be a natural consequnce of it.<note place="margin">Theor. bo. 2. ch. 3. &amp; 4th.</note> And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
such a course of nature laid before us, as agrees
with the reports of Scripture, and with general Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
why should we quit that, to comply with an
imaginary presumption: that these were miraculously
preserv'd, and all the rest were short-liv'd. I know he
pretends,<note place="margin">p. 2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>7.</note> we may as well conclude all Men were Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50178:30"/>
in those days, because <hi>Moses</hi> says, <hi>There were Giants
upon the Earth in those days,</hi> Gen. 6. 4. as conclude
that all Men were long-liv'd in those days, because
<hi>Moses</hi> mentions some that were so. There had been
some pretence for this, if <hi>Moses</hi> had made a distinction
of two races of Men in the first World: Long-livers
and short-livers; as he hath distinguisht the Giants
from the common Race of Mankind. Or, as he hath
said in one case, <hi>There were Giants on the Earth in those
days.</hi> So if he had said in the other, <hi>there were Long-livers
upon the Earth in those days:</hi> and upon that, had
given us a List of the Long-liv'd Patriarchs: this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
would have made the cases pretty parallel. But,
on the contrary, <hi>Moses</hi> makes no such distinction of
long-living and short-living races, before the Flood;
nor yet notes it as a mark of divine favour, or extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
benediction upon those persons that liv'd so
long. Therefore, not to suppose it general to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
at that time, is a groundless restriction, which is
neither founded upon Scripture nor Reason.</p>
               <p>As to the second Argument for Antediluvian lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gevity,
taken from Tradition and the Testimony of the
Ancients;<note place="margin">p. 276, 277.</note> He objects, that <hi>Iosephus</hi> does not seem to
be firm in that opinion himself. But what then? The
Theorist lays no stress upon <hi>Iosephus</hi>'s single opinion,
but refers to the Testimonies of those Authors, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Greeks,</hi> or such as have given an account of the
<hi>Aegyptian, Chaldean,</hi> and <hi>Phoenician</hi> Antiquities: which
are call'd in by <hi>Iosephus,</hi> as witnesses of this Truth or
Tradition, concerning the long lives of the first Men.
And at last,<note place="margin">p. 278.</note> the Excepter seems content, this Tradition
should be admitted: seeing the <hi>Authors are too many,
and too considerable, to have their Testimonies question'd
or rejected.</hi> But then he will make a further Question,
<hi>Why</hi> there should not also be a Tradition concerning
the <hi>Perpetual Equinox,</hi> or <hi>Perpetual Spring,</hi> upon which
this Longevity depended. But this Question is fully
answer'd, and the Tradition fully made out before, in
the 8<hi>th.</hi> Chapter, which I need not here repeat. In like
manner, all the secondary Questions which he there
mentions, depending upon, and being included in this
first, receive their resolution from it. For when a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50178:31"/>
Equinox is once truly stated, there is no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
concerning the rest.</p>
               <p>After these contests about Traditions, he hath one
or two <hi>Reasons</hi> against this <hi>Antediluvian Longevity.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">79, 280.</note>
First, Because the Earth, by this means, would have
been over-stockt with People before the time of the
Deluge. Secondly, They should all have been of the
same Longevity before the Flood. Neither of these,
methinks, have any strength in them. As to the first,
That Earth was much more capacious than this is,
where the Sea takes away half of its Surface, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
it uninhabitable. And whereas he suggests, as a
recompence,<note place="margin">ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>That Mountains</hi> have more surface and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
than Plains; That's true, but they are also less
habitable, by reason of their barrenness and rugged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Who can believe that there are as many People
in <hi>Wales,</hi> as in other parts of <hi>England,</hi> upon the same
compass of level ground? Or no more in <hi>Holland,</hi> than
upon a like number of Acres upon the <hi>Alpes</hi> or <hi>Pyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neans?</hi>
There would be room enough for twice as many
People as there are in the World, and twice as many
Animals, if there was food enough to nourish them.
But here I have two things to complain of, as foul
play: First, the Excepter cites the Theory partially.
Secondly, he does not mark the place whence he takes
that citation: as if it was on purpose to hide his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality.
The words he cites are these, <hi>If we allow the
first Couple, at the end of one hundred years, or of the first
Century,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eng. Theor. <hi>p.</hi> 23.</note> 
                  <hi>to have left ten pair of Breeders, which is an easie
supposition, there would arise from these in fifteen hundred
years, a greater number than the Earth was capable of:
allowing every pair to multiply in the same decuple pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
the first pair did.</hi> Here the Excepter stops, and
makes this inference, that upon an <hi>easie supposition,</hi> which
the Theorist makes and allows, the Earth would have
been over-stockt in fifteen hundred years. This is an
<hi>easie supposition</hi> for the <hi>first Century,</hi> as the Theorist put
it: But it would be a very uneasie one for the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Centuries; when they came to be at any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
distance from the beginning. And therefore the
Theorist tells you, in that very Page, <hi>The same measure
cannot run equally through all the Ages.</hi> And in his Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50178:31"/>
you see, after the first Century, he hath taken
only a <hi>quadruple proportion for the increase of mankind.</hi>
As judging that a <hi>moderate and reasonable measure betwixt
the Highest and the Lowest.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ibid.</note> This the Excepter might
easily have observed, and as easily avoided this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>application
of the words of the Theorist.</p>
               <p>His second reason against the antediluvian longevity
is slighter that the first.<note place="margin">p. 280.</note> For he pretends that all the
Antediluvians, upon that supposition, should have
been equally long-liv'd. You may as well say, that all
the children of the same parents, and that live in the
same place, should now be equally long-liv'd; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
world being the same to them all. But, besides ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,
their <hi>stamina</hi> and constitutions might then be
of a different strength, as well as now: tho' they were
born of the same Parents, and liv'd in the same Air.
Lastly,<note place="margin">p. 281.</note> he moves a difficulty about the multiplication
of Animals in the first World, that they would have
been too numerous before the Flood. I can say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to that, nor He neither, upon good grounds:
unless we knew what Species's of Animals were then
made, and in what degrees they multiplied. The
Theorist always supposes a Divine Providence to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintend,
proportion, and determine, both the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and food of Animals upon the Earth: suitably to
the constitution and circumstances of every World.
And seeing that Earth was no less under the care and
direction of Providence, than the present, we may
conclude that due measures were taken for adjusting
the numbers and food of Animals in such manner, as
neither to be a burthen to one another, nor to man.</p>

            <div n="14" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XIV.</head>
               <p>THIS Chapter is against the Explication of the
Deluge by the <hi>Dissolution of the Earth.</hi> That dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
as is pretended, being unfit or insufficient to
produce such an effect. And to prove this, the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theorist
gives us five Arguments, whereof the first is
this: <hi>Moses</hi> having left us an accurate description of
Paradise, <hi>according to the proper rules of Topography,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 285.</note> such
a description would have been improper and insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50178:32"/>
to determine the place of Paradise, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
useless, if the Earth had been dissolv'd: and
by that means the bounds of those Countreys, and
the Chanels of those Rivers, broken and chang'd. This
objection, I'me afraid, will fall heavier upon <hi>Moses,</hi> or
upon the Excepter himself, than upon the Theorist.
However one would have expected that the Excepter
should have determin'd here the place of Paradise, in
vertue of that description. So learned and sagacious
a person, having before him an exact draught of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise,
<hi>according to the proper rules of Topography,</hi> could
not fail to lay his finger upon the very spot of ground
where it stood. Yet I do not find that he hath ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
to determine the place of Paradise, either in this
Chapter, or in the precedent. Which gives me a
great suspicion, that he was not satisfied where it stood,
notwithstanding the Mosaical Topography. Now if
it cannot be understood or determin'd by that Topo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy,
one of these two things must be allowed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that the description was insufficient and ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual:
or that there has been some great change in
the Earth, whereby the marks of it are destroy'd;
namely, the bounds of Countries, and the courses
of the Rivers. If he take the second of these answers,
he joyns with the Theorist. If the first, he reflects,
according to his way of arguing, upon the honour
of <hi>Moses,</hi> or confutes himself.</p>
               <p>But here is still a further charge:<note place="margin">p. 286.</note> 
                  <hi>Moses</hi>'s description
of Paradise would have been <hi>False</hi> (which he notes for
<hi>horrid blasphemy)</hi> if the Earth ws broken at the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge.
For then those Rivers, by which <hi>Moses</hi> describes
Paradise, could not have been before the Flood. But
why so, I pray? The Theorist supposes Rivers before
the Flood, in great plenty: and why not like to these?
And if their chanels were very much chang'd by the
Flood, that's no more than what good Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters
suppose. Being unable, upon any other sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
to give an account, why it is so hard (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<hi>Moses</hi>'s description) to determine the place
of Paradise. Now where is the <hi>Blasphemy</hi> of this:
<hi>Horrid Blasphemy against the holy Ghost?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ibid.</note> A rude and
injudicious defence of Scripture, by railing and ill lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50178:32"/>
is the true way to lessen and disparage it. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when we make our own consequences to be of
the same authority with the Word of God: and what<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>soever
is against them, must be charg'd with blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
against the Holy Ghost. Is it not a strange
thing that the Dissolution of the Earth should be made
Blasphemy? when the Prophets and inspir'd Authors
speak so often of the <hi>Disruptions,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See <hi>Review, p.</hi> 35, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>Fractions, Concussions,</hi>
and <hi>Subversions</hi> of the Earth. And that very expression,
that the <hi>Earth is dissolv'd,</hi> is a Scripture-expression.
(<hi>Psal. 75. 3. Isa. 24. 19. Amos.</hi> 9. 5.) which, methinks,
might have been enough to have protected it from
the imputation of blasphemy. But there is nothing
safe against blind zeal, and opinionative ignorance;
which, by how much they find themselves weaker in
reasons, by so much they become more violent in
passions.</p>
               <p>But to return to the objection; upon the whole
matter, he casts the burthen of the charge upon <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
himself, as we noted before. For take whether Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis
you will, that the Earth was, or was not,
broken: the question still returns, if the Mosaical To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pography
was exact and sufficient, why can we not
yet find out the situation of Paradise? 'Tis now above
three thousand years since <hi>Moses</hi> dyed, and men have
been curious and very inquisitive, in all ages, to find
out the place of Paradise: but it is not found out to
this day to any satisfaction. So that, methinks, upon
the whole, the Theory, which supposeth the Earth
very much chang'd, makes the fairest Apology both
for <hi>Moses</hi> and mankind, in this particular. But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to his second Argument.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">p. 288.</note> says the Excepter, <hi>The dissolution of the
Earth could not be the cause of the general Flood, because
it would have utterly destroy'd</hi> Noah's <hi>Ark, and all that
were in it.</hi> I thought the Theorist had effectually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
this objection, by puting the Ark under the
conduct of its Guardian Angels, and of a miraculous
Providence.<note place="margin">Eng. Theor. <hi>p.</hi> 108.</note> These are his words, <hi>I think it had been
impossible for the Ark to have liv'd upon the raging Abyss,
or for</hi> Noah <hi>and his family to have been preserv'd, if there
had not been a miraculous hand of Providence to take care
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50178:33"/>
of them.</hi> Now, either the Excepter did not take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of this passage in the Theory, or he does not allow
that a miraculous hand was sufficient to preserve the
Ark: or thirdly, he made an objection, which he knew
himself, to be impertinent. And, I confess, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable
to think the last is true. For as to the first,
he confesses (p. 354.) that the <hi>Theory represents the
Ark, with its Guardian Angels about it, in the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Flood.</hi> And as to the second, He himself
makes use of a miraculous power to preserve the Ark,
upon his Hypothesis: in answer to the eighth objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
p. 351, 352, &amp;c. Why then may not we make use
of the same power and with the same effect? It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
therefore, that he was conscious to himself that
he made this objection to no purpose.</p>
               <p>But that is not all: He has also us'd foul play in his
citation. For whereas the great danger of the Ark would
be at the first fall of the Earth, or the disruption of
the Abyss; The Theorist, he says, to prevent this, makes
the Ark to be a-float by the Rains, before the Abyss
was broken. But is that all the Theorist says in that
place? does he not assign another way how the Ark
might be a-float? namely, in a River, or in a Dock.
These are the words of the Theory,<note place="margin">p. 98.</note> 
                  <hi>So as the Ark, if
it could not float upon these Rain-waters, at least taking
the advantage of a River, or of a dock or cistern made to
receive them, it might be a-float before the Abyss was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
open.</hi> And these words being in the same place
whence he makes his citation, it must be a wilful dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation
not to take notice of them. But he see they
would have taken off the edge of his objection, and
therefore thought fit not to touch upon them. But
after all, there is no necessity that the Ark should be
a-float, before the Earth broke. Those things were
premis'd in the Theory, only to soften the way to men
that are hard of belief in such extraordinary matters.
For the Angels, (whose ministery we openly own, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these grand occasions) could as easily have held
the Ark, a-float, in the Air, as on the water. And
the Ark, being an Emblem of the Church, God certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
did <hi>give his Angels charge over it; that they should
bear it up in their hands, that it might not be dash'd against
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50178:33"/>
a stone.</hi> And this having been more than once, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
by the Theorist, we must again conclude this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
superfluous and useless.</p>
               <p>The third objection is this.<note place="margin">p. 289</note> If the Earth had been
thus dissolv'd, <hi>The present Earth would have been, in like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood,
of another figure, than what now it bears.</hi> These
are his words, but I suppose he means, that it would
have been of another form, as to Sea and Land. And
the reason he gives is this: Because, says he, it would
have broke first, in the Equator, and consequently that
part falling down first, would have been swallowed up
by the waters, and become all Sea. Whereas we
find, that under the Equator that then was (which he
supposeth the present Ecliptick) <hi>the dry ground is of
most spatious extent and continuity.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ibid.</note> We need not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
his account of Sea and Land, because it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
upon a false supposition. He relapses here into
his former Astronomical error,<note place="margin">See <hi>p.</hi> 27. before.</note> or to his first adds a
second; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Earth, when it chang'd its situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
chang'd its Poles and Circles. This is a great
mistake; the change of position in respect of the
Heavens, did not change the places of its Circles in
respect to its own Globe. As when you change a
Sphere or a Globe out of a <hi>right situation</hi> into an <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi>
the Circles do not change their places, as to that
Sphere or Globe: but have only another position to
the Heavens. The Earth's Ecliptick runs through the
same places it did before: and the Equinoctial regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of that Earth were the same with the Equinoctial
regions of this; only bear another posture to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
and the Sun. These Circles have not chang'd
places with one another, as he imagines: and which is
worse, would father this imagination upon the Theory;
in these words, <hi>under the Ecliptick (which, in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
situation of the Earth, (ACCORDING TO THE
THEORY) was its Equinoctial, and divided the Globe
into two Hemispheres, as the Equator does now) the dry
ground,</hi> &amp;c. He that affirms this, with respect to the
Earth, neither understands the <hi>Theory,</hi> nor the <hi>Doctrine
of the Sphere.</hi> But let's press no further upon a mistake.</p>
               <p>The fourth objection is this:<note place="margin">p. 290.</note> That such a Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of the Earth, would have caus'd great barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50178:34"/>
after the Flood. Partly by turning up some dry
and unfruitful parts of the Earth: and partly by the
soil and filth that would be left upon its surface. As
to the first, I willingly allow, that some of the interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
and barren parts of the Earth might be turn'd up;
as we now see in Mountainous and wild Countries:
but this rather confirms the Theory, than weakens it.
But as to the second, that the filth and soil would
have made the Earth more barren, I cannot allow
that. For good Husbandmen overflow their grounds,
to make their crop more rich. And 'tis generally sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
that the Inundation of <hi>Nile,</hi> and the mud it
leaves behind it, makes <hi>Aegypt</hi> more fruitful. Besides,
this part of the objection lies against the common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of the Deluge, as well as against that which
is given by the Theory. For if you suppose an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Deluge, let it come from what causes you please,
it must overflow all the Earth, and leave mud and slime
and filth upon the surface of it. And consequently
cause barrenness, according to this argumentation.</p>
               <p>He adds another consideration under this head,<note place="margin">p. 292.</note>
namely, that if the Earth had been dissolv'd in this
manner, <hi>All the buildings erected before the Flood, would
have been shaken down, or else overwhelmed. Yet we read
of some that outstood the Flood, and were not demolish'd.
Such were the pillars of</hi> Seth, and <hi>the Cities</hi> Henochia
<hi>and</hi> Joppa. As to <hi>Seth</hi>'s pillars, they are generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
fabulous. And I perceive the excepter will
not vouch for them. For he concludes, (<hi>p.</hi> 295.) <hi>I know
the very being is question'd of</hi> Seth's <hi>pillars,</hi> &amp;c. If he
will not defend them, why should I take the pains to
confute them? I do not love to play with a Man, that
will put nothing to the stake. That will have his
chance to win, but can lose nothing, because he stakes
nothing. Then as to the City <hi>Henochia,</hi> it hath no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
but that of <hi>Annius Viterbiensis,</hi> and his <hi>Berosus.</hi>
A Book generally exploded, as fictitious. Lastly, as to
<hi>Ioppa,</hi> the authority indeed is better, though still un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.
But however, suppose the ruines of one Town
remain'd after the Flood, does this prove that the
Earth was not dissolv'd? I do not doubt, but there
were several tracts of the Earth, much greater than
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50178:34"/>
that Town, that were not broken all to pieces by their
fall. But you and your <hi>English</hi> Historian are mistaken,
if you suppose the Altars and Inscriptions mention'd
by <hi>Mela,</hi> to have been Antediluvian Altars and Inscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions.
Unless you will make the Fable of <hi>Perseus</hi> and
<hi>Andromeda,</hi> and the <hi>Sea-Monster,</hi> to have been an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tediluvian
Fable. Neither hath your Historian been
lucky in translating those words of <hi>Mela, cum religione
plurimâ, with the grounds and principles of their religion,</hi>
which signifie only, <hi>with a religious care or superstition.</hi>
But to leave Fables, and proceed.</p>
               <p>His last Argument against the Dissolution is this.<note place="margin">p. 296.</note>
Had the Dissolution of the Earth been the cause of the
Deluge, <hi>It would have made God's Covenant with</hi> Noah
<hi>a very vain and trifling thing.</hi> So much is true, That
the Deluge, in the course of Nature, will not return
again in the same way. But unless God prevent it, it
both may and will return in another way. That is, if
the World continue long enough, the Mountains will
wear and sink, and the Waters in proportion rise: and
overflow the whole Earth. As is plainly shewn, by a
parallel case, in the <hi>first Book</hi> of the <hi>Theory, ch.</hi> 4. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
God might, when he pleas'd, by an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
power, and for the sins of Men, bring another
Deluge upon the World. And that is the thing which
<hi>Noah</hi> seems to have fear'd, and which God, by his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
secur'd him against. For, as the Excepter hath
said himself, in answering an harder objection, (p. 152.)
<hi>When God assigned to the Waters the place of their abode,
he did not intend to fortifie them in it against his own om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence,
or to devest himself of his Sovereign Prerogative
of calling them forth when he pleased.</hi> This being allow'd,
with what we said before, that Covenant was not vain
or trifling, either in respect of an ordinary or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Providence.</p>
               <p>Thus we have done with all the Exceptions against
the Theory. For the two next Chapters are concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
a new Hypothesis of his own. And the last of
all, excepts not against the truth of the Theory, but
the certainty of it. In reflection upon this whole
matter, give me leave to declare Two things; First,
That I have not knowingly omitted any one Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50178:35"/>
that I thought of moment. Secondly, That I have
not from these Exceptions found reason to change any
part of the Theory, nor to alter my opinion, as to any
particular in it. No doubt there are several Texts of
Scripture, which, understood according to the Letter
in a Vulgar way, stand cross, both to this, and other
natural Theories. And a Child that had read the first
Chapters of <hi>Genesis,</hi> might have observ'd this, as well
as the Excepter: but could not have loaded his charge
with so much bitterness. Some Men, they say, though
of no great Valour, yet will fight excellently well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
a Wall. The Excepter, behind a Text of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
is very fierce and rugged. But in the open
Field of Reason and Philosophy, he's gentle and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable.
<note place="margin">Eng. Theor. book 2. ch. 9. at the end.</note> The Theorist had declar'd his intentions, and
oblig'd himself, to give a full account of <hi>Moses</hi> his
<hi>Cosmopoeia,</hi> or <hi>six-days Creation:</hi> but did not think it
proper to be done in the Vulgar Language, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the whole Theory was compleated. This might
have spar'd much of the Excepter's pains; But till that
account be given, if the Excepter thinks fit to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
his Animadversions, and go thorough the Two
last Books, as he hath done the two first, it will not
be unacceptable to the Theorist. Provided it be done
with sincerity, in reciting the words, and representing
the sence of the Author.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XV.</head>
               <p>IN This Chapter the Anti-theorist lays down a new
Hypothesis for the Explication of the Deluge.<note place="margin">p. 299.</note> And
the War is chang'd, on his side, from Offensive, to
Defensive. 'Tis but fair that he should lie down in
his turn: and if some blows smart a little, he must
not complain, because he begun the Sport. But let's
try his Hypothesis,<note place="margin">p. 297, 300.</note> without any further ceremony.
The first Proposition laid down for the establishing
of it, is this: <hi>That the Flood was but fifteen Cubits high,
above the ordinary level of the Earth.</hi> This is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful
Paradox, and a very unlucky beginning;
For under what notion must this Proposition be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd?
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50178:35"/>
As a <hi>Postulatum,</hi> or as a <hi>Conclusion?</hi> If it be a
Postulatum, it must be clear from its own light, or
acknowledg'd by general consent. It cannot pretend
to be clear from its own light, because it is matter
of Fact, which is not known, but by Testimony. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it generally acknowledg'd: For the general
opinion is, that the Waters cover'd the tops of the
Mountains; Nay, that they were fifteen Cubits higher
than the tops of the Mountains. And this he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
himself, in these words: <hi>We shall find there is a
great mistake in the common Hypothesis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 300.</note> 
                  <hi>touching their
depth:</hi> namely, of the Waters. <hi>For Whereas they have
been supposed to be fifteen Cubits higher than the highest
Mountains: They were indeed but fifteen Cubits high in
all, above the Surface of the Earth.</hi> And this Opinion,
or Doctrine, he calls,<note place="margin">p. 329. <hi>lin. 19. c.</hi> 31. p. 339. <hi>lin.</hi> 18.</note> 
                  <hi>The general standing Hypothesis:
The usual Hypothesis: The usual sence they have put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Sacred Story.</hi> It must not therefore be made a
<hi>Postulatum,</hi> that such an Hypothesis is false, but the
falsity of it must be demonstrated by good Proofs.
Now I do not find that this new Hypothesis, of a
<hi>fifteen-cubit-Deluge,</hi> offers at any more than one single
proof, namely, from <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 20. But before we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the examination of that, give me leave to note
one or two things, wherein the new-Theorist seems to
be inconsistent with himself, or with good sence.</p>
               <p>At his entrance upon this new Hypothesis, he hath
these words, (P. 300.) <hi>Not that I will be bound to defend
what I say, as true and real,</hi> &amp;c. But why then does he
trouble himself, or the World, with an Hypothesis,
which he does not believe to be <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real?</hi> or if
he does believe it to be so, Why will he not defend
it? for we ought to defend truth. But he says more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
(p. 302. lin. 19.) <hi>Our supposition stands supported by
Divine authority: as being founded upon Scripture. Which
tells us, as plainly as it can speak, that the Waters prevailed
but fifteen Cubits upon the Earth.</hi> If his Hypothesis be
founded upon Scripture: and upon Scripture <hi>as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as it can speak.</hi> Why will not he defend it as <hi>true</hi>
and <hi>real?</hi> For to be supported by Scripture, and by
plain Scripture, is as much as we can alledge for the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50178:36"/>
Articles of our Faith: which every one surely is bound
to defend.</p>
               <p>But this is not all the difficulty we meet with. The
whole period which we quoted runs thus. <hi>Not that I
will be bound to defend what I say, as true or real; any
more than to believe (what I cannot well endure to speak)
that the Church of God has ever gone on in an irrational
way of explaining the Deluge. Which yet she must needs
have done, if there be no other rational method of explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, and no other intelligible Causes of it, than what the
Theory has propos'd;</hi> Now for the word <hi>Theory,</hi> put the
word <hi>Excepter,</hi> or <hi>Excepter's Hypothesis,</hi> and see if this
charge, <hi>That the Church of God has ever gone on in an
irrational way of explaining the Deluge,</hi> does not fall as
much upon the Excepter's new Hypothesis, as upon
the Theory. If the Church-Hypothesis was rational,
what need he have invented a new one? why does he
not propose that Hypothesis, and defend it? I'me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
it will be found that he does not only contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
the Church-Hypothesis, but reject it as mistaken
and irrational. For what is the Church-Hypothesis,
but the <hi>Common Hypothesis?</hi> (p. 300. lin. 24.) The <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
standing</hi> Hypothesis: The <hi>usual</hi> Hypothesis: <hi>The u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
sence they put upon the Sacred story.</hi> All these he
rejects and disputes against; as you may see in the
places fore-cited. And also he calls them such <hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 312. ult.</note> as <hi>have been,</hi> and <hi>justly may be disgustful, not only
to nice and squeamish, but to the best and soundest Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophick
judgments.</hi> And, <hi>p.</hi> 319. He says by his Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,
<hi>we are excused from running to those Causes or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
which seem unreasonable to some, and unintelligible
to others, and unsatisfactory to most.</hi> And, to name no
more, he says, <hi>p.</hi> 330. The ordinary supposition, that
the Mountains were cover'd with water in the Deluge,
brings on a <hi>necessity of setting up a new Hypothesis for
explaining the Flood.</hi> Now, whose Methods, Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Supoositions are these, which he reflects upon?
Are they not the commonly receiv'd Methods and
Suppositions? 'Tis plain, most of those which he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
(p. 310, 311, 313, 314, 318.) are not the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist's.
<note place="margin">Eng. Theor. ch. 2. &amp; 3.</note> For the Theorist had rejected before, those very
Methods and Inventions, which the Excepter rejects
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50178:36"/>
now: and so far the justifies the
Theory<note n="*" place="margin">The Excepter rejects, first the <hi>Waters of the Sea.</hi> Then the <hi>Waters in the bowels of the Earth.</hi> Then the <hi>Supercelestial Waters.</hi> Then a <hi>New Creation of Waters.</hi> Then the <hi>mass of Air</hi> chang'd into water. And lastly, a <hi>partial Deluge.</hi> And therefore he puts men fatally, either upon the Theory, or upon his new Hypothesis.</note> These reflections there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must fall upon some other Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis:
And what Hypothesis is
that, if it be not the Church-Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis?
To conclude, I argue thus
in short, to show the Excepter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with himself in this particular. The Church-way
of explaining the Deluge, is either <hi>rational</hi> or <hi>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational.</hi>
If he say it is <hi>rational,</hi> why does he desert it,
and invent a new one? And if he say it is <hi>irrational,</hi>
then that dreadful thing, which, <hi>he cannot well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to speak, That the Church of God has ever gone on
in an irrational way of explaining the Deluge,</hi> falls flat
upon himself.</p>
               <p>Thus much in general, for his Introduction. We
proceed now to examine particularly his new Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis.
Which, as we told you before, consists chiefly
in this, <hi>That the Waters of the Deluge were but fifteen
Cubits higher than the common unmountainous Surface of
the Earth. This,</hi> which seems so odd and extravagant,
he says,<note place="margin">p. 301.</note> is the <hi>Foundation</hi> of his Hypothesis. And, which
is still more surprising, he says this depth, or rather
shallowness, or the Waters of the Deluge, is told us
by Scripture,<note place="margin">p. 302. <hi>lin.</hi> 21.</note> 
                  <hi>as plainly as it can speak.</hi> This must
needs raise our curiosity, to see that place of Scripture,
which has been over-lookt by all the Learned hitherto.
Well, 'tis <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 20. in these words, <hi>Fifteen Cubits up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
did the Waters prevail.</hi> This, me thinks, is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
general: for the Basis of these <hi>fifteen Cubits</hi> is
not exprest, in these words. But why does our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
stop in the middle of a Verse: Why does he not
transcribe the whole Verse: for the last part of it, is
as good Scripture as the first. And that says plainly,
that the <hi>Mountains were cover'd with the Waters.</hi> The
whole Verse runs thus: <hi>Fifteen Cubits upwards did the
Waters prevail; AND THE MOVNTAINS WERE
COVERED.</hi> Now, if the Basis of these fifteen Cubits
was the commons Surface, or plain level of the Earth,
as the new Hypothesis will have it: How could fifteen
Cubits, from that Basis, reach to the tops of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains?
Are the highest Mountains but fifteen Cubits
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50178:37"/>
higher than the common surface of the Earth?<note place="margin">1 Sam. 17. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Goliah</hi>
was six cubits and a span high. So <hi>Pic Tenariff</hi> would
not be thrice as high as <hi>Goliah.</hi> Yet <hi>David</hi> slung a
stone up to his forehead. Take what cubit you please,
Sacred or common, it does not amount to two foot.
So the height of the greatest Mountains, from bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
to top, must not be thirty foot, or ten paces: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this New Hypothesis. Who ever mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
Mountains at this rate? The modern Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians
allow for their height a mile perpendicular,
upon a moderate computation; and that makes 3000
foot. How then could waters that were not 30 foot
high, cover Mountains that were 3000 foot high?
That the highest Mountains of the Earth were cover'd
with the waters, you may see express'd more fully in
the precedent verse. <hi>And the waters prevailed exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
upon the Earth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 7. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>And all the high Hills that were
under the whole Heaven were cover'd.</hi> There can scarce
be words more plain and comprehensive. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter
says, the Scripture tells us, as <hi>plainly as it can
speak,</hi> that the waters were but fifteen cubits high from
the common surface of the Earth. And I say, The
Scripture tells us as <hi>plainly as it can speak,</hi> That, <hi>all the
high Hills under the whole Heaven, were covered with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
And it must be a strange sort of Geometry, that
makes fifteen cubits of water reach to the top of the
highest Hills. Lastly, the same History of <hi>Moses</hi> says,
the tops of the Mountains were discover'd, when the
waters begun to decrease, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 5. Is not that a plain
demonstration that they were cover'd before, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with those waters.</p>
               <p>We may therefore safely conclude two things. First,
that this new Hypothesis, besides all other faults, is
contrary to the general exposition
of the text of <hi>Moses</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">This he acknowledges, p. 325. <hi>(We expound a Text or two of Scripture so as none ever did; and deserting the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon receiv'd sence, put an unusual Gloss upon them,</hi> not to say, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>a private interpretation,)</hi> and p. 359.</note> Secondly,
that it is contrary to the general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cei'd
Doctrine of the Deluge. And
if he has deliver'd a doctrine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to these two methinks, it should be hard for
him to maintain his ground, and not pronounce at
the same time, what he dreads so much to speak, <hi>That
the Church of God has ever gone on in an irrational way
of explaining the Deluge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:50178:37"/>But let's reflect a little upon this Fifteen-cubit De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge;
to see what figure it would make, or what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
it would do upon mankind and upon other
Creatures. If you will not believe <hi>Moses</hi> as to the
overflowing of the Mountains, at least, I hope, you
will believe him as to the universal destruction made
by the Deluge. Hear his words, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 21, 22, 23.
we'l take only the last verse, which is this, <hi>And every
living substance was destroyed, which was upon the face of
the ground. Both man and cattle, and creeping things,
and the fowl of the heavens; and they were destroyed from
the Earth: and</hi> Noah <hi>only remained alive, and they that
were with him in the Ark.</hi> Now I would gladly know
how this could be verifyed in a fifteen-cubit Deluge.
The birds would naturally fly to the tops of Trees,
when the ground was wet. And the Beasts would
retire by degrees to the Mountains and higher parts
of the Earth, as the lower begun to be overflow'd;
and if no waters could reach them there, how were
they all destroy'd, while they had so many Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and places of refuge?</p>
               <p>Or if you suppose some of these Creatures had not
wit enough to save themselves, (though their wit and
instincts lie chiefly in that) at least mankind would not be
so stupid: when men see the waters begin to rise, they
could not fail to retire into Mountains. And tho'
the upper stories of their houses might be sufficient
to save them from fifteen cubits of water; yet if fear
made them think themselves not secure there, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could it drive them, but still into higher places.
And an House seated upon an Eminency, or a Castle
upon a Rock, would be always a safe retreat from this
diminutive Deluge. I speak all this upon the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
of the Excepter, who allows not only Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
and Rocks,<note place="margin">p. 215, 216, 292, &amp;c.</note> but also Castles and Cities before the
Deluge: built of good Timber, and Stone, and Iron,
and such substantial materials. But how in such a
case, and in such a state of things, all mankind (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<hi>Noah</hi> and his Family) should be destroy'd by fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
cubits of water, is a lump of Incredibilities, too
hard and big for me to swallow.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:50178:38"/>But there is still another difficulty, that we have not
mention'd. As those that were upon the Land might
easily save themselves from ruine, so those that were
upon the Sea, in ships, would never come in danger.
For what would it signifie to them, if the Sea was
made a few fathoms deeper, by these new waters?
It would bear their vessels as well as it did before, and
would be no more to them than a Spring-tide. And lastly
how shall we justifie the Divine Wisedom, which gave
such punctual orders, for the building of an Ark, to
save <hi>Noah,</hi> and a set of Creatures, for a new World:
when there were so many more easie and obvious
ways to preserve them, without that trouble?</p>
               <p>These objections, in my opinion, are so plain and
full, that it is not needful to add any more. Nor to
answer such evasions as the new Theorist attempts to
make to some of them. As for instance, to that plain
objection from <hi>Moses</hi>'s words,<note place="margin">p. 330.</note> that <hi>the Mountains were
cover'd with the waters,</hi> he says, first, that it is a <hi>Synec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche,</hi>
where the whole is put for a part. Or Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
'tis an <hi>Hyperbole:</hi> where more is said than under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
Or Thirdly, 'tis a <hi>Poetical History.</hi> Or Lastly,
if none of these will do,<note place="margin">p. 332, 333.</note> by the <hi>Tops</hi> of the Mountains
is to be understood the <hi>bottoms</hi> of the Mountains: and
that cures all. The truth is, he has taken a great deal
of pains in the next Chapter to cure and incurable Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis.
We will give you but one instance more.
'Tis about the <hi>appearance of the tops of the Mountains
at the decrease of the Deluge.</hi> Which argues strongly
that they were cover'd in the Deluge. But take it in
his own words,<note place="margin">p. 337.</note> with the answer, <hi>It is recorded,</hi> Gen. 8. 5.
<hi>that the waters decreased continually until the tenth month,
and on the first day of the month, WERE THE TOPS OF
THE MOVNTAINS SEEN. Now if the mountains had
not been quite under water, and so invisible for the time
they were overwhelmed; how could they be said to become
visible again, or to be seen upon the Floods going off?</hi> This
is a plain and bold objection. And after two an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
to it, which he seems to distrust, his 3<hi>d</hi> and last
is this:<note place="margin">p. 339.</note> 
                  <hi>If these two considerations will not satisfie, we must
carry on the enquiry a little further, and seek for a Third.
And truly some one or other must needs be found out.—
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50178:38"/>
Thirdly, therefore we consider: that the tops of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
may be said to be seen, at the time mentioned, upon
account of their EMERGENCY OVT OF DARKNESS,
NOT OVT OF WATERS.</hi> This is his final Answer.
The tops of the Mountains, at the decrease of the
Deluge, were seen: not that they were covered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with water, says he, but with darkness. Where
finds he this account? 'tis neither in the Text nor in
reason. If it was always so dark, and the tops of the
Mountains and Rocks naked and prominent every
where, how could the Ark avoid them in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
Moreover, If the Deluge was made in that
gentle way that he supposes, I see no reason to imagine,
that there would be darkness, after the forty-days-rain.
For these rains being faln, and all the Vapours
and clouds of the Air, discharg'd, methinks there should
have ensued an extraordinary clearness of the Air: as
we often see after rainy seasons. Well, 'tis true: But
the rains, he supposes, were no sooner faln, but the Sun
retracted them again in Vapours: with that force
and swiftness that it kept the Air in perpetual darkness.
Thus he says afterwards.<note place="margin">p. 341.</note> He's mightily beholden to
the Sun, upon many accounts: and the Sun is no less
beholden to him: for he gives him a miraculous power
to raise Mountains, and draw up Waters. 'Tis well
the Sun did not presently fall to his old work again, of
raising Mountains out of this moist Earth: as the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter
says he did, when the Earth was first drain'd.
That he contented himself now to suck up the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
only,<note place="margin">See ch. 10.</note> and let the Earth alone: We are not a little
beholden to him for this. For he seems to have had
the same power and opportunity, at the decrease of
the Deluge, of making new ravages upon the Earth,
that he had before when it was first drain'd. But let's
<hi>see, how</hi> or <hi>when,</hi> these waters were suck'd up, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
into vapours.</p>
               <p>Upon the expiration of the 40 days rain, whether
was the Air purg'd of Vapours and clear, or no? Yes,
it was purg'd. He says (<hi>p.</hi> 343.) <hi>The Atmosphere was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so exhausted of Vapours, and never so thin: as when the
waters were newly come down.</hi> Then in that clear Air,
the tops of the Mountains might have been seen, if
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50178:39"/>
they lay above water. But <hi>Moses</hi> says, it was in the
<hi>Tenth Month</hi> that they begun to be seen,<note place="margin">Gen. 8. 5.</note> when the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were decreas'd; 'twas therefore the Waters, not
the gross Air, that hindered the sight of them before.
And according to this Method of the Excepter, after
the first Forty days, the Deluge begun to decrease.
For the Sun forth-with set his Engines a work, and
resolv'd the Waters into vapor and exhalations, at
such a rate,<note place="margin">p. 341.</note> that he presently made all the Atmosphere
dark with thick Mists and Clouds: and, in proportion,
lessen'd the Waters of the deluge. But we do not
read in <hi>Moses</hi> of any abatement in the Deluge, till the
end of one hundred and fifty days; (<hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 3.) which
is four Months after this term. The truth is, The
whole notion of <hi>spending the Waters of the Deluge by
Evaporation,</hi> is no better than what the Excepter su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
it would be thought:<note place="margin">p. 343.</note> 
                  <hi>A meer fancy, a whimsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
groundless figment.</hi> For what could the Sun do, in
the Northern and Southern parts of the World, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the exhaling of these Waters? And in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
Climates, why should they not fall again in
Rains, (if he had a power to exhale them) as they do
now? Was not the Earth in the same position, and
the Sun of the same force? Besides, where does he find
this notion in Scripture, that the Waters of the Deluge
were consum'd by Evaporation? <hi>Moses</hi> says, the <hi>Waters
returned from off the Earth, in going and returning:</hi> Gen.
8. 3, 5. that is, after frequent reciprocations, they
setled at length in their Chanels. Where <hi>bounds were
set them, that they might not pass over: that they return
not again to cover the Earth.</hi> Seeing therefore this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hath no foundation, either in Scripture or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
'tis righty enough styl'd, in the Excepter's words,
a <hi>meer fancy,</hi> and <hi>groundless figment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I think we have had enough of these shifts and
evasions.<note place="margin">p. 303.</note> Let us now proceed to the 2<hi>d.</hi> part of his
new Hypothesis, which is this: That the <hi>Abyss</hi> or <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hom-Rabbah,</hi>
which was broken open at the Deluge,
and (together with the Rains) made the Flood, was
nothing but the Holes and Caverns of Rocks and
Mountains: which open'd their mouths at that time,
and pour'd out a great quantity of Water. To sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50178:39"/>
this new notion of <hi>Tehom-Rabbah,</hi> he alledgeth but
one single Text of Scripture: <hi>Psal. 78. 15. He clave the
Rocks in the Wilderness, and gave them drink, as out of the
Great Depths.</hi> That is, copiously and abundantly, as if it
were out of the great Deep. So the next Verse implies,
and so it is generally understood. As you may see both
by Interpreters, and also by the <hi>Septuagint</hi> and <hi>Vulgate</hi>
Translations, and those of the <hi>Chaldee Paraphrase</hi> and
the <hi>Syriack.</hi> But the Excepter, by all means, will have
these holes in the Rocks to be the same with the
<hi>Mosaical Abyss,</hi> or Great Deep, that was broken open
at the Deluge. So the <hi>Great Deep</hi> was not one thing,
or one continued Cavity, as <hi>Moses</hi> represents it, but ten
thousand holes, separate and distant one from another.
Neither must the Great Deep, according to him, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
a <hi>low place,</hi> but an <hi>high place.</hi> For he confesses
these Caverns were higher than the
common level of the Earth.<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 303. But though these Caverns be called Deeps, we must not take them for profound places, that went down into the Earth, below the common Surface of it: on the contrary, they were si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate above it.</note> But
I do not see, how, with any tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
propriety or good sence, that,
which is higher than the Surface of
the Earth, can be call'd the <hi>Great Deep.</hi> An Abyss, in
the Earth, or in the Water, is certainly <hi>downwards,</hi> in
respect of their common Surface. As much as a Pit is
<hi>downwards.</hi> And what is downwards from us, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
suppose to be above us, without confounding all
dimensions, and all names, of things. Calling that low,
which is high: a Mountain a Valley, or a Garret a Cellar.</p>
               <p>Neither is there any thing in this Text, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 15.
that can justly induce us to believe the <hi>Great Abyss</hi> to
be the same thing with Caverns in Rocks. For whether
you suppose it to be noted here as a miraculous thing,
that God should give them Water
<hi>out of a Rock,</hi> or <hi>out of a FLINT</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 114. 7, 8. Tremble thou Earth at the presence of the Lord, at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> Which turned the Rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of Waters. <hi>Num.</hi> 20. 10, 11. And Moses and Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron gathered the Congregation together before the Rock, and he said unto them, Hear now you rebels: must we fetch you water out of this Rock? And <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> lift up his hand, and with his rod he smote the Rock twice: and the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came out abundantly.</note>,
as plentifully, as if it had been out
of the Great Abyss. Or whether you
understand the original of Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
to be noted here: which are
said in Scripture to come from the
Sea, or the great Abyss; neither of
these sences make any thing to the
purpose of the new Hypothesis, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50178:40"/>
yet they are the fairest and easiest sence that can be
put upon the words: and that which agrees best with
other places of Scripture, where the same matter of
fact, or the same History is related. And therefore
there can be no necessity, from the Text, of changing
the general notion and signification of <hi>Deep</hi> or <hi>Abyss.</hi>
Both from that which it hath in common use, and
that which it hath in Scripture-use.</p>
               <p>I say, as in the common use of words, <hi>Deep</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byss</hi>
signifies some low or inferiour place: So the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
use of it in Scripture, is in the same sence. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to signifie the Sea, or some subterraneous place.
<hi>Who shall descend into the Abyss or Deep:</hi> says the Apostle,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 7. Is that as much, as if he had said, Who
shall <hi>ascend</hi> into the holes of the Rocks? And when
<hi>Iacob</hi> speaks of the blessings of the Abyss, or of the
Deep, he calls them the blessings of the <hi>Deep that ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth under:</hi>
Gen. 49. 25. In like manner, <hi>Moses</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
calls it the <hi>Deep that coucheth beneath:</hi> Deut. 33. 13.
And I know no reason why we should not understand
the same <hi>Deep</hi> there, that he mentioned before in the
History of the Deluge. Which therefore was subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous,
as this is. Then as for the other use of the
word, namely, for the Sea, or any part of the Sea,
(whose bottom is always lower than the level of the
Earth) that is the most common use of it in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
And I need not give you Instances, which are
every where obvious.</p>
               <p>One must needs think it strange therefore, that any
Man of judgment should break thorough, both the
common use of a word, and so many plain Texts of
Scripture that shew the signification of it, for the sake
of one Text; which, at most, is but dubious. And
then lay such stress upon that new signification, as to
found a new doctrine upon it. And a doctrine that
is neither supported by reason, nor agrees with the
History of the Deluge. For, as we noted before, at
the decrease of the Deluge, the Waters are said to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
from off the Earth:</hi> Gen. 8. 3. Did they not return
to the places from whence they came? but if those
places were the Caverns in the Rocks, whose mouths
lay higher than the Surface of the Deluge, as he says
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50178:40"/>
they did:<note place="margin">p. 303, 305.</note> I see no possibility of the Waters returning
into them. But the Excepter hath found out a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
invention to evade this argument. He will
have the <hi>returning</hi> of the Waters, to be understood of
their returning into their Principles, (that is, into va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors)
not to their Places. In good time: So the Dove's
<hi>returning,</hi> was her returning into her Principles: that
is, into an Egg, not into the Ark. Subtleties ill-foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
argue two things, wit and want of judgment.
<hi>Moses</hi> speaks as plainly of the local return of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<hi>in going and returning;</hi> as of the local going and
returning of the Raven and Dove. See <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 3, &amp; 5.
compar'd with Verse 7<hi>th.</hi> &amp; 9<hi>th.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, That we may end this Discourse; the whole
notion of these Water-pots in the tops of Mountains,
and of the broaching of them at the Deluge, is a
groundless imagination. What reason have we to
believe, that there were such Vessels then, more than
now: if there was no Fraction of the Earth, at the
Deluge, to destroy them. And he ought to have gag'd
these Casks, (according to his own rule<note n="*" place="margin">ch. 3.</note>) and told us
the number and capacity of them, that we might have
made some judgment of the effect. Besides, if the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
the Abyss at the Deluge, had been the opening
of Rocks, why did not <hi>Moses</hi> express it so: and tell us,
that the <hi>Rocks were cloven, and the waters gushed out,</hi>
and so made the Deluge? This would have been as
intelligible, if it had been true, as to tell us that the
<hi>Tehom-Rabbah</hi> was broken open. But there is not one
word of <hi>Rocks,</hi> or the <hi>cleaving of Rocks,</hi> in the History
of the Flood. Upon all accounts therefore, we must
conclude, that this Virtuoso might have as well su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected,
that his whole Theory of the Deluge, as one
part of it, would be accounted <hi>a meer fancy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 343.</note> and <hi>ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
figment.</hi>

I have taken as much notice of them, as I

thought necessary, in the precedent Chapter: and
therefore leave the Excepter now to deal with them
all together. I omitted one objection (<hi>p.</hi> 311.) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the shutting up of the Abyss, and the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of the Abyss, because it was answer'd before in

               <head>CHAP. XVII.</head>
               <p>THERE is nothing in this Chapter against the
Truth of the Theory, but the Author is blam'd
for believing it to be true. I think he had been more
blame-worthy, if he had troubled the World with a
Theory which he did not believe to be true: and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
so much pains to compose, what he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
no better than a Romance. As to what the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orist
has said in reference to his assurance or belief of
the Theory, which the Excepter calls <hi>positiveness:</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
examination, I cannot find any thing amiss in his
conduct, as to that particular. For, first, he imposes
his sentiments upon no man: He leaves every one
their full liberty of dissenting. <hi>Preface to the Reader,</hi>
at the end. <hi>Lastly, in things purely speculative, as these
are, and no ingredients of our Faith, it is free to differ
from one another, in our opinions and sentiments; And so
I remember</hi> S. Austin <hi>hath observ'd, upon this very
subject of Paradise. Wherefore as we desire to give no
offence our selves, so neither shall we take any at the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of judgment in others. Provided, this liberty be mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
and that we all agree to study PEACE, TRUTH,
and a GOOD LIFE.</hi> And as the Theorist imposes his
Sentiments upon no man, so, as to matter of certainty,
he distinguisheth always betwixt the <hi>substance</hi> of the
Theory, and <hi>particularities.</hi> So, at the latter end of
the <hi>First Book,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eng. Theor. <hi>p.</hi> 150.</note> this profession is made; <hi>I mean this only,</hi>
speaking about certainty, <hi>as to the general parts of the
Theory. For as to particularities, I look upon them only as
problematical: and accordingly I affirm nothing therein,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50178:41"/>
but with a power of revocation, and a liberty to change my
opinion when I shall be better inform'd.</hi> And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he says in another place: <hi>I know how subject we are
to mistakes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eng. Theor. <hi>p.</hi> 96.</note> 
                  <hi>in these great and remote things, when we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
to particularities. But I am willing to expose the
Theory to a full triall, and to shew the way for any to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
it, provided they do it with equity and sincerity.
I have no other design than to contribute my endeavours to
find out truth,</hi> &amp;c. Lastly, To cite no more places,
he says,<note place="margin">Eng. Theor <hi>p.</hi> 288.</note> 
                  <hi>There are many particular explications that are
to be consider'd with more liberty and latitude: and may,
perhaps, upon better thoughts and better observations, be
corrected,</hi> &amp;c. The Theorist having thus stated and
bounded his belief or assurance, and given liberty of
dissenting to all others, according to their particular
judgments or inclinations, I see nothing unfair or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent
in this conduct. How could the Observator
have made it more unexceptionable? Would he have
had the Theorist to have profest Scepticism: and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
that he believ'd his own Theory no more than
a Romance or phantastical Idea? That had been, both
to bely his own conscience, and to mock the World.
I remember I have heard a good Author once wish,
That there were an <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> that whoever
Printed a Book, should, when he took a Licence,
Swear, that he thought the <hi>Contents of his Book to be
true,</hi> as to substance. And I think such a method
would keep off a great many impertinencies. We
ought not to trouble the World with our roving
thoughts, meerly out of an itch of Scripturiency,
when we do not believe our selves what we Write.
I must always profess my assent to the substance of
that Theory: and am the more confirm'd in it, by the
weakness and inefficacy of these Exceptions.</p>
               <p>We need not take notice of the particular citations
he makes use of, to prove this <hi>positiveness</hi> of the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orist.
For they only affirm, what we still own, That
the Theory is more than an <hi>Idea:</hi> or that it is not an
<hi>Imaginary Idea:</hi> or that it is a <hi>reality.</hi> And, together
with its proofs from Scripture: especially from S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi>
hath more than the certainty of a <hi>bare Hypothesis,</hi>
or a <hi>moral certainty.</hi> These are the expressions he cites,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50178:42"/>
and we own all, that, in fair construction, they amount
to. And find no reason, either from the nature of
the thing, or from his objections, to change our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
or make any Apology for too much positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>I wish the Excepter had not more to answer for,
as to his <hi>Partiality:</hi> than the Theorist hath, for his
<hi>positiveness.</hi> And now that we draw to a conclusion,
it will not be amiss to observe, how well the Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hath answered that character, which he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
at the beginning of his work. These are his
words.<note place="margin">p. 43.</note> 
                  <hi>This I will endeavour to do,</hi> namely, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the Theory, <hi>with all sincerity; and that only as a
Friend and Servant to Truth. And therefore with such
Candour, Meekness, and Modesty, as becomes one who as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes
and glories in so fair a Character: And also with
such respect to the Virtuoso who wrote the Theory, as may
testifie to the world, that I esteem his Learning, while I
question his Opinion.</hi> 'Tis of little consequence what
opinion he has of the <hi>Virtuoso,</hi> as he calls him. But
let us see with what <hi>sincerity</hi> and <hi>meekness,</hi> he has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd
his Work. As to his sincerity, we have given
you some proofs of it before (<hi>p.</hi> 26.) both in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
and partial citations: and also, in his never
taking notice of the last Edition of the Theory:
where several citations he has made use of, are not
extant. Now, by his own Rule, he ought to have
had regard to this; for he says, (<hi>p.</hi> 356.) He will
there take notice only of the English Edition, as <hi>coming
out after the other: and so with more deliberation and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
thoughts of things.</hi> By the same reason, say I, he
ought to have taken notice of the last Edition of the
Theory, as being the last product, and the most <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate
and mature thoughts</hi> of the Author. But this,
it seems, was not for his purpose.</p>
               <p>So much for his Sincerity: Now for his <hi>Meekness.</hi>
So impatient he is to fall upon his Adversary, that he
begins his charge in the Preface: and a very fierce
one it is. (<hi>p.</hi> iii.) The <hi>Theorist hath assaulted Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and that in the very foundation of it.</hi> Here I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to have found two or three Articles of the
Creed assaulted or knock'd down by the Theory. But
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50178:42"/>
that is not the case, it seems: he understands some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more general: namely, our contradicting Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
For so he explains himself in the next Page.
<hi>In several things (as will appear by our discourse) it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts
Scripture; and by too positive asserting the truth
of its Theorems, makes that to be false, upon which our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is founded.</hi> Let us remember, that this contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
Scripture, here pretended, is onely in natural
things: and also observe, how far the Excepter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
in such things, hath contradicted Scripture. As
for other reproofs which he gives us, those that are
more gentle, I easily pass over: but some-where he
makes our assertions <hi>too bold an affront to Scripture.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 78.</note>
And in another place represents them, as (either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly,<note place="margin">p. 286.</note>
or consequentially) <hi>Blasphemy against the Holy
Ghost:</hi> which is the unpardonable Sin: <hi>Matt.</hi> 12. 31.</p>
               <p>There is no pleasure in repeating such expressions,
and dreadful sentences. Let us rather observe, if the
Excepter hath not made himself obnoxious to them.
But first, we must state the case truly, that so the
blame may not fall upon the Innocent. The case
therefore is this, <hi>Whether,</hi> to go contrary to the Letter
of Scripture, in things that relate to the natural
World, be <hi>destroying the foundations of Religion: affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Scripture:</hi> and <hi>blaspheming the Holy Ghost.</hi> In the
Case propos'd, <hi>We</hi> take the <hi>Negative,</hi> and stand upon
that Plea. But the Excepter hath taken the <hi>Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:</hi>
and therefore all those heavy charges must fall
upon himself, if he go contrary to the Literal sence
of Scripture, in his Philosophical opinions or asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And that he hath done so, we will give you
some Instances, out of this Treatise of his: <hi>Pag.</hi> 314.
He says, <hi>It is most absurd to think, that the Earth is the
center of the World.</hi> Then the Sun stands still, and the
Earth moves, according to his doctrine. But this is
expresly contrary to Scripture, in many places. The
<hi>Sun rejoices,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ps. 19. 5, 6. Ios. 10. 12, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>as a strong Man, to run his race,</hi> says
<hi>David: His going forth is from the end of the Heaven,
and his circuit unto the ends of it.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Kin. 20. 10, 11. Isa. 38. 8.</note> No such thing, says
the Excepter: The Sun hath no race to run: he is fixt
in his seat, without any progressive motion. He hath
no course from one end of the Heavens to the other.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50178:43"/>
In like manner, <hi>Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon,</hi> says
the Sacred Author: <hi>and the Sun stood still.</hi> No, says
the Excepter, 'twas the Earth stood still, upon that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle:
for the Sun always stood still. And 'tis <hi>absurd,</hi>
yea <hi>most absurd,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 157.</note> to think otherwise. And he blames
<hi>Tycho Brahe</hi> for following Scripture in this particular.
Now is not this, in the language of the Excepter, to
<hi>destroy the foundations of Religion: To affront Scripture:</hi>
and <hi>blaspheme against the Holy Ghost?</hi> But this is not
all. The Excepter says, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 10.) the Sun rais'd up
the Mountains on the 3<hi>d.</hi> Day. And the Sun was not
in being till the 4<hi>th.</hi> Day: according to Scripture:
<hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 14. The Moon also, which according to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
was not created till the 4<hi>th.</hi> Day: he says, would
hinder the formation of the Earth, which was done
the 3<hi>d.</hi> Day.<note place="margin">p. 74.</note> Lastly, In his new Hypothesis, he makes
the Waters of the Deluge, to be but fifteen Cubits
higher than the Plain, or common Surface of the
Earth.<note place="margin">Gen. 7. 19, 20.</note> Which Scripture affirms expresly to have co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
the tops of the highest Hills,<note place="margin">Gen. 8. 5.</note> or Mountains, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Heaven. These two things are manifestly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent.
The Scripture says, they cover'd the tops of
the highest Mountains: And the Excepter says, they
reach but fifteen Cubits, about, or upon the skirts of
them. This, I think, is truly to contradict Scripture:
or, according to his talent of loading things with great
words,<note place="margin">p. 216.</note> 
                  <hi>This is not onely flatly, but loudly contradictory to
the most express word of the Infallible God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These observations, I know, are of small use, unless
perhaps to the Excepter himself. But if you please,
upon this occasion, let us reflect a little upon the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
style of Scripture: and the different authority of
that style, according to the matter that it treats of.
The subject matter of Scripture is either such, as lies
without the cognizance and comprehension of humane
reason, or such as lies within it. If it be the former
of these, 'tis what we call properly and purely <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi>
And there we must adhere to the literal style,
because we have nothing to guide us but that. Such
is the Doctrine of the Trinity, and the Incarnation:
wherein we can have nothing to authorize our devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
from the Letter and words of Scripture. And
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50178:43"/>
therefore the School-Divines, who have spun those
Doctrines into a multitude of Niceties and Subtleties,
had no warrant for what they did, and their conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
are of no authority.</p>
               <p>The second matter or subject of Scripture, is such,
as falls under the view and comprehension of Reason,
more or less: and, in the same proportion, gives us a
liberty to examine the Literal sence: how far it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with reason, and the faculties of our mind. Of
this nature there are several things in the Holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
both Moral, Theological, and Natural, wherein
we recede from the Letter, when it is manifestly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the dictates of reason. I will give some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
in every kind. First, as to Moral things. Our
Saviour says,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 29<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 30.</note> 
                  <hi>If thy right Eye offend thee, pluck it out.
If thy right hand offend thee, cut it off.</hi> There is no Man
that thinks himself oblig'd to the Literal practice of
this doctrine: And yet it is plainly deliver'd, you see,
in these terms, in the Gospel. Nay, which is more,
our Saviour backs and enforces the letter of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
with a <hi>Reason: For it is profitable for thee that one
of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole Body
should be cast into Hell.</hi> As if he had intended that his
Precept should have been really executed according to
the Letter. In like manner, our Saviour says, <hi>If any
man will sue thee at Law, and take away thy Coat, let him
have thy Cloak also.</hi> And yet there is no Christian so
good-natur'd, as to practise this: nor any Casuist so
rigid, as to enjoyn it, according to the Letter. Other
Instances you may see in our Saviour's Sermon upon
the Mount, where we do not scruple to lay aside the
Letter, when it is judg'd contrary to the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or impracticable in humane Society.</p>
               <p>In all other things also, that lie within the sphere
of humane reason, we are allow'd to examine their
<hi>practicability,</hi> or their <hi>credibility.</hi> To instance in some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
Theological: The words of <hi>Consecration</hi> in the
Sacrament. Our Saviour, when he instituted the last
Supper, us'd these words; <hi>This is my Body:</hi> taking the
Bread into his hand. Which words joyn'd with that
action, are very formal and expressive. Yet we do
not scruple to forsake the Literal sence, and take the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50178:44"/>
words in another way. But upon what warrant do
we this? Because the literal sence contains an absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity:
Because it contradicts the light of Nature? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is inconsistent with the Idea of a Body, and
so destroys it self. In like manner, upon the Idea of
the Divine Nature, we dispute Absolute Reprobation,
and an Eternity of Torments, against the letter of
Scripture. And, Lastly, Whether the Resurrection-Body
consists of the same individual parcels and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
whereof the mortal Body consisted, before it
was putrified or dispers'd.<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 3. Apoc. 3. 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20. 12.</note> And whether the <hi>Book
of Life</hi> are to be understood in a literal sence.</p>
               <p>The last Head is of such things as belong to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
World. And to this may be reduc'd innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Instances, where we leave the literal sence, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with Science, or experience. And the truth
is, if we should follow the Vulgar Style and literal sence
of Scripture, we should all be <hi>Anthropomorphites,</hi> as to the
Nature of God: And as to the Nature of his works in the
external Creation, we must renounce Philosophy and
Natural Experience, if the descriptions and accounts
given in Scripture, concerning the <hi>Heavens,</hi> the
<hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>Sea,</hi> and other parts of the World, be
received as accurate and just representations of the
state and properties of those Bodies. Neither is there
any danger lest this should affect or impeach the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Veracity; for Scripture never undertook, nor
was ever designed to teach us Philosophy, or the Arts
and Sciences. And whatsoever the Light of Nature
can reach and comprehend, is improperly the Subject
of Revelation. But some men, out of love to their
own ease, and in defence of their ignorance, are not
only for a Scripture-Divinity, but also for a Scripture-Philosophy.
'Tis a cheap and compendious way, and
saves them the trouble of farther study or examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, you see, it is no fault to recede
from the literal sence of Scripture, but the fault is
when we leave it without a just cause. As it is no
fault for a man to separate from a Church: or for
a Prince to make war against his Neighbour: but to
do the one or the other, without a just cause, is a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50178:44"/>
real fault. We all leave the literal sence in certain
cases, and therefore that alone is no sufficient charge
against any man. But he that makes a separation, if
I may so call it, without good reasons, he is truly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to censure. The great result of all therefore,
is this, to have some common Rule to direct us, when
every one ought to follow, and when to leave, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
Sence. And that Rule which is generally agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by good Interpreters, is this, <hi>Not</hi> to leave the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
Sence, when the subject matter will bear it,
without absurdity or incongruity. This Rule I have
always proposed to my self, and always endeavoured
to keep close to it. But some inconsiderate minds
make every departure from the Letter, let the Matter
or Cause be what it will, to be an affront to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
And there, where we have the greatest liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
I mean in things that relate to the Natural world,
They have no more indulgence or moderation, than
if it was an intrenchment upon the Articles of Faith,
In this particular I cannot excuse the present Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverter;
yet I must needs say, he is a very Saint
in comparison of another Animadverter, who hath
writ upon the same subiect, but neither like a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
nor like a Christian: nor like a Scholar. And
such Writings answer themselves.</p>
