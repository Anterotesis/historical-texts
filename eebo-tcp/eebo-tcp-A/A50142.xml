            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

'Twere well if the blessed leisure which</hi> Deus fecit, <hi>is given by God unto us, were employ'd unto</hi> spiritual Advantages <hi>by us all; and particularly by them that have a kindness for the affairs of</hi> Souldiery. <hi>It would be an incredible benefit to the Church of God, for men to have their houses furnished with</hi> Treatises <hi>which shall teach them how to</hi> Spirituallize <hi>the outward occurrents of their</hi> Occupations, <hi>and set</hi> Pulpits, <hi>and faithful</hi> Preachers <hi>for them in every</hi> Business <hi>that they have to meddle with.

There is in these <hi>Oracles</hi> of God, a delicious Entertainment for the innumerable sorts of Readers to whom <hi>these presents come;</hi> and the Benefit of the <hi>Souldier</hi> particularly is not left unconsulted in them. The blessed <hi>Suitableness</hi> of this <hi>miraculous Book</hi> unto the Affayrs and Concerns of all men, is, to be found (as the Philosopher saith, of the <hi>Soul in the Body)</hi> in <hi>every part</hi> thereof; but the Book of <hi>Psalms</hi> (a <hi>Little Bible,</hi> as <hi>Luther</hi> styl'd it) in pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarwise, is so remarkable on this score, that it was no imprudence in old <hi>Ierom</hi> to bid his Friend make This his <hi>Vade mecum,</hi> his constant Companion, it was no folly in the holy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of <hi>Constantinople</hi> being driven out of that City, to take no part of his Treasures but This, which was unto him <hi>pro et prae Divitiis,</hi> instead of and better than all the <hi>Riches</hi> of the World; the renouned <hi>Basil</hi> therefore very rightly recommended it as <hi>A Divine Treasure,</hi> and the eloquent <hi>Chrysostom</hi> no less appositely reputed it as, a <hi>Panoply for the Christian.</hi> From this <hi>Panoply,</hi> from this well-furnished <hi>Armory,</hi> give me leave to offer something for the Use of this <hi>Armed,</hi> and much honoured Auditory. For this cause the name which the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <hi>in a certain place</hi> (in <hi>Col</hi> 3. 16.) putteth upon these <hi>Psalms</hi> is that of <hi>spiritual Songs;</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:31811:7"/>
partly because the <hi>Spirits</hi> of men are most sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly <hi>suited</hi> therein: every man may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, as <hi>Athanasius</hi> long ago observed, That they speak <hi>de se, in re sua,</hi> to his <hi>own case</hi> directly. Tis to be hoped that the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Souldier</hi> especially will anon herein meet with what shall not be impertinent unto <hi>him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That inspired person, whoever he were, that <hi>marshalled</hi> the Psalms into the <hi>Method</hi> wherein we now enjoy them, seems to have had some respect unto the Affinity of <hi>Subjects</hi> therein handled, in his doing of it.

            <p>The Rapturous <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> of the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Psalmist

begin as soon as was possible; even at the verse now before us. The <hi>gracious Saint</hi> is here uttering of his Wishes that the great GOD may forever be well-spoken of by all the world, and this on a double account. Something God hath <hi>been</hi> to him, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing God had <hi>done</hi> for him.</p>
            <p>Firstly, For Something that God <hi>was</hi> to him. He ascribes to the Lord that Title, <hi>my Strength,</hi> or (Heb. <hi>Tzuri) my Rock.</hi> 
               <q>q. d. The Almighty God has afforded a better <hi>Defence</hi> to me in all dangers than the ragged <hi>Rocks</hi> and Caves and Thickets did unto my poor Countrey men, before I by slaying the <hi>tall Pagan</hi> occasion'd the Routing of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines,</hi> who had driven them thereinto.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Nextly, For something that God <hi>did</hi> for him. He celebrates this Kindness of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>He teaches my hands to war and my fingers to Fight.</hi> i. e. <q>The good God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables me to go through the <hi>Military</hi> Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances which I am put upon. These <hi>Hands</hi> of mine that were once wont to hold the <hi>Shepherds Crook,</hi> and these <hi>Fingers</hi> of mine which were wont to solace me with their soft <hi>Notes</hi> upon my <hi>Harp,</hi> are now expert in

These may be singled out, because there is a <hi>special Use</hi> of these parts in all warly Encounters. There was so parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, first in <hi>Choosing</hi> and then in <hi>Casting</hi> the <hi>Stone</hi> which laid the <hi>Philistean</hi> Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sprawling on the ground. In the <hi>Hands</hi> also <hi>Strength</hi> is seated, and <hi>Skill</hi> is shewed by the <hi>Fingers.</hi> So both of those Qualifications may herein be glanced at. The good Soul next declares the <hi>Subject</hi> which this Teaching was <hi>Occupy'd</hi> about: This was <hi>Warring</hi> and <hi>Fighting.</hi> The former Expression <hi>[Lakrob]</hi> comes from a Root that signifies to <hi>Draw near;</hi> the Latter <hi>[Lammilchama]</hi> comes from a Root that signifies to <hi>Eat up;</hi> because in War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Engagements, persons first <hi>Approach</hi> and then <hi>Devour</hi> one another.</p>
