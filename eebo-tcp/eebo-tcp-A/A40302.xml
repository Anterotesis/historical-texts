            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

minds directed to the ſcope or work of perfect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; ſo that the perfect comprehending of ſound reaſon, and the perſeverance thereof, be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the Knowledge of God, being the True and Perfect Virtue; whereof let no wiſe man be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, although be ſees divers men of divers diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for Wiſdom which ſpringeth of Virtue, cannot abide or acquaint her ſelf with fond <hi>Idiots,</hi> unleſſe that (on the other ſide) the malice of perverſe lither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs prolong her daies, and cauſe the ſame <hi>Idiocy</hi> to ſurvive; wherefore aſſuredly the Crown and Price of Virtue lyeth open unto all men, and the moſt Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God ordereth the judgement of the ſame: I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly (as manifeſtly as poſſible is) will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour my ſelf to teſtifie and confeſs unto you, all the hope which is <hi>in me;</hi> I think verily that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours which before this time have lately been, even for their Tiranny had the Empire taken from them, and my Father onely exerciſing and uſed all meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and lenity in his affairs, calling upon God the Father with great devotion and humility, hath been exalted to the ſame, and all the reſt as men wanting their wits, and in compariſon as ſavige Beaſts, rather did give themſelves to like cruelty, then unto any lenity and gentleneſs towards their Subjects, in which Tiranny every one for his time being noſuled, utterly ſubverted the True and Unfallible Doctrine, and ſo great malice was there kindled in their Breaſts, that when all things were in peaceable tranquality, they made and raiſed moſt cruel and bloody inteſtine or civil Warrs; it is credibly informed us, that in thoſe dayes <hi>Apollo</hi> gave Anſwers, but not by any mans Mouth, but out of a certain Cave and dark place, (ſaying) that he was much diſquietted by thoſe that were the juſt men and livers upon the Earth, ſo that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46478:5"/>
he could or would not for them declare a truth of ſuch things as others demanded, and hereby it came to paſſe that ſuch falſe divinations were given from the golden Tables in <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and in this thing did his Prophetical Prieſt complain of, when he took up again the hair of his head that others had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly caſt down? And that the neglecting of his divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was the cauſe of ſo many evils amongſt men; but let us ſee what was the end hereof; we now boldly and without all fear invocate and worſhip the omnipotent God. When I was a Child I heard that he which then was chief <hi>Emperour</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, yea moſt unhappy man, being ſeduced and brought into errour by his Souldiers, curiouſly enquired who were thoſe juſt men upon the earth that <hi>Apollo</hi> meant, and one of his Prieſts which was near about him, made anſwer that they were the Chriſtians; this anſwer hereupon unto him being as delectable as honey unto the mouth, drew the ſword given unto him to be revenged upon evil doers and malefactors, againſt the Profeſſors of the irreprehenſible Sanctimony and Religion, and ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way he gave forth a Commiſſion (to bloudy homicides as I may well call them) and gave commandment to all the Judges, that they ſhould endeavour themſelves with all the cunning they had, to the deviſing of more grievous and ſharper puniſhment againſt the poor Chriſtians; then, then I ſay, a man might have ſeen how greatly the honeſt profeſſors of that Religion were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted with cruelty, and daily ſuffered no ſmall injuries and contumelies, and that alſo they ſuffered and ſuſtained the ſame with ſuch temperance, as though they had had no injuries done unto them at all, which temperance and patience of theirs was the cauſe why the furious Citizens were the more mad and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging againſt them; what fires, what tortures, what kind of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were there, but they without reſpect either of age or ſex were inforced to feel?</p>
            <p>Then did the earth without doubt her ſelf bewail her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and the round world which containeth all things, being ſprinkled and imbrued with their bloud, made doleful lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for them, and the day it ſelf provoked for to mourn was made amazed for them, but what is this to purpoſe? Now the very barbarous Nations rejoyce for their ſakes, which received and harboured them when they were afraid and fled from us, keeping them as it were in moſt loving and amiable Captivity,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46478:6"/>
and they ſaved not onely their lives, but alſo were a defence for their Religion; and now alſo the <hi>Roman</hi> Nation remembreth, and hath before their eyes this blame and ſpot, which the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that were of that time worthily gave unto them, when they by them were baniſhed (as unfit members of their Common wealth) amongſt the barbarous people; what needeth to make further rehearſal of the mourning lamentation which the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then people themſelves throughout all the world made for the pitiful murder and ſlaughter of them? After that it came to paſſe, that they which were Authors of all theſe miſchiefs died alſo, and were committed for their reward to the moſt filthy and horrible Dungeon of Hell, they being ſo intangled with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine and civil wars, left alive neither name nor kinſman of their own, which thing undoubtedly had not chanced, unleſſe the wicked devinations of <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Oracles had deceived and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched them; To thee therefore now I pray, Oh moſt mighty God, that thou wilt vouchſafe to be merciful, and pardon all the Eaſt parts, and Inhabitants of the ſame, being oppreſſed with calamity, and that by me thy Servant thou wilt of thy goodneſſe help and relieve the ſame; and theſe things raſhly crave I not at thy hands, Oh Lord moſt mighty, and holieſt God of all, for I being perſwaded by the onely Oracles, have both begun and alſo finiſhed wholeſom and profitable things; and further, by the bearing and ſhewing of thine Enſign, have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a mighty and ſtrong Hoſt, and when any neceſſity of the Common-weal (to my charge committed) requireth thereunto (following thoſe ſigns and tokens of thy vertues) I boldly go forth and fight againſt mine Enemies; and for this cauſe have I ſacrificed my-ſoul unto thee, purified and cleanſed both with thy love and fear; Yea truly, thy Name do I ſincerely love, and thy power do I reverence, which by many tokens and wonders hath ſhewed and confirmed thereby my belief and faith; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will I do my endeavour, and bend my ſelf thereunto, that I may re-edifie thy moſt holy Houſe, which thoſe wicked and ungodly <hi>Emperors,</hi> have with ſo great ruine laid waſte; thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do I deſire to bring and eſtabliſh in firm peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, and that for the publick utility of all the Inhabitants of the earth, thoſe which yet erre, and are out of the way, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the benefit of peace and quietneſſe with and amongſt the number of the faithful ſort, for I truſt the reſtitution of the

like ſociety and participation may be a means to bring them alſo that erre into the perfect way of verity; Let no man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be grievous one unto another, but whatever man thinketh beſt, that let him do, for ſuch as are wiſe ought throughly to be perſwaded, that they onely mean to live holily, and as they ſhould do, whom the Spirit of God moveth to take their delight and recreation in reading his holy will; and if others wilfully will go out of the way, cleaving to the Synagogues of falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrîne, they may at their own peril; as for us we have the moſt worthy houſe, or congregation of Gods verity, which he accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own goodneſſe and nature hath given us; and this alſo we wiſh unto them, that with like participation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent, they may feel with us the ſame delectation of mind; for this our Religion is neither new nor newly invented, but is as old as we believe the Creation of the world to be, and which God hath commanded to be celebrated with ſuch worſhip as both ſeemed and pleaſed him; but all living men are Lyars, and are deceived with divers and ſundry deluſions; Thou O God for Chriſt thy Sons ſake, ſuffer not this wickedneſſe again to root, thou haſt ſet up a clear and burning Light, that thereby as many as thou haſt choſen may come unto thee, theſe thy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles approved the ſame, it is thy power that keepeth us in innocency and fidelity, the Sun and the Moon run their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed courſe, neither yet in ranging wiſe wander the Stars to what place of the world they liſt themſelves, the dayes, years, months and times keep their appointed turns, the earth abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth firm and unremovable at thy word, and the wind at the time (by thee directed) ſtormeth and bloweth, the ſtreaming watering flouds ebb in time according as they flow, the raging Sea abideth within her bounds and limits, and for that the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean Sea ſtretcheth out her ſelf in equal length and breadth with the whole earth, this muſt needs be wrought with ſome marvellous workmanſhip of thine own hand, which thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it were at thy will made and diſpoſed, without all doubt ſo great difference and partition between would ere this time have brought utter ruine and deſtruction both to the life of man, as to all that belongeth to man beſide, which for that they have ſuch great and huge conflicts amongſt themſelves, as alſo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Spirits have; We give thee thanks O Lord moſt mighty, God of all Gods, that all mankind hath not been deſtroyed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46478:7"/>
thereby; Surely even as greatly as thy benignity and gentleneſs is manifeſted by divers and ſundry benefits beſtowed upon us, ſo much alſo is the ſame ſet forth and declared in the diſcipline of thy eternal Word to thoſe that be heavenly wiſe, and apply themſelves to the attainment of ſincere and true vertue; but if any ſuch there be that little regard, or have but ſmall reſpect unto the conſideration thereof, let them not blame or lay a fault in others that do the ſame; for that Phyſick whereby health is obtained, is manifeſtly offered unto all men; Now therefore let no man go about to ſubvert that which experience it ſelf doth ſhew (of neceſſity) to be pure and good; Let us therefore altogether uſe the participation of this benefit beſtowed upon us, that is to ſay, the benefit of peace and tranquillity, ſetting apart all controverſie, and let no man hurt or be prejudicial to his fellow for that thing wherein he thinketh himſelf to have done well, if by that which any man knoweth and hath expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of, he thinketh he may profit his neighbour, let him do the ſame, if not let him give over, and remit it till another time, for there is a great diverſity betwixt the willing and the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary embracing of Religion, and that when a man is thereunto informed, &amp; counſeled; of theſe things have I made a more large diſcourſe, than indeed the ſcope &amp; mediocrity requireth, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally becauſe I would not have my faith (touching the verity) to be hid, for that I hear there be ſome which complain the old accuſtomed haunting of their Temples, and that the power of ſuch darkneſſe is cut off and taken away, which thing ſurely I would take in better part, were it not that the violent rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>flagitious</hi> errour were ſo fixed in many mens hearts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they thirſt after the utter ſubverſion of the Common-weal and Empire.</p>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46478:7"/>
We have given commandment to all men to qualifie matters of Religion as they themſelves thought good, and that alſo the Chriſtians ſhould keep the opinions and Faith of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but becauſe that many and ſundry opinions by the ſame our firſt Licence ſpring and increaſe through ſuch liberty gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, We thought good manifeſtly to add thereunto, and make plain ſuch things whereby perchance ſome of them in time to come may from ſuch their obſervance be let or hindred; When therefore by proſperous ſucceſſe, I <hi>Conſtantinus Auguſtus;</hi> and I <hi>Linicius Auguſtus</hi> came to <hi>Mediliolanum,</hi> and there ſat in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil upon ſuch things as ſerved for the utility and profit of the Common-Weal, theſe things amongſt others we thought would be beneficial to all men, yea and before all other things we purpoſed to eſtabliſh thoſe things wherein the true Reverence and Worſhip of God is comprehended, that is, to give unto the Chriſtians free choice to follow what Religion they think good, and whereby the ſame ſincerity and celeſtial grace, which is in every place received, may alſo be embraced and accepted of all our loving Subjects; according therefore unto this our pleaſure upon good adviſement and ſound judgement, we have Decreed, that no man ſo hardy be denied to chuſe and follow the Chriſtian obſervance or Religion, but that this liberty be given to every man, that he may apply his mind to what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion he thinketh meet himſelf, whereby God may perform upon us all his accuſtomed care and goodneſſe; To the intent therefore you might know that this is our pleaſure, We thought it neceſſary this to write unto you, whereby all ſuch errors and opinions being removed, which in our former Letters being ſent unto you in the behalf of the Chriſtians are contained, and which ſeem very undeſcreet and contrary to our clemency may be made fruſtrate and annihilate; Now therefore firmly and freely We will and command, that every man have a free liberty to obſerve the Chriſtian Religion, and that without any grief or moleſtation he may be ſuffered to do the ſame. Theſe things have we thought good to ſignifie unto you by as plain words as we may, that we have given to the Chriſtians, free and abſolute power to keep and uſe their Religion; and for ſo much as this liberty is abſolutely given of us unto them, to uſe and exerciſe their former obſervance, if any be diſpoſed, it is manifeſt that the ſame helpeth much to eſtabliſh the publique
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46478:8"/>
tranquillity of our time, every man to have Licenſe and liberty to uſe and chuſe what kind of worſhipping he liſt himſelf; and this is done of us onely for the intent that we would have no man to be enforced to one Religion more than another; and this thing alſo amongſt others we have provided for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that they may have again the poſſeſſion of ſuch places in which heretofore they have been accuſtomed to make their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies; ſo that if any have bought or purchaſed the ſame ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of us or of any other, the ſame places without either mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or other recompence forthwith and without delay We will to be reſtored again unto the ſaid Chriſtians; And if any man have obtained the ſame by gift from us, and ſhall require any recompence to be made to them in that behalf, then let the Chriſtians repair to the Preſident, being the Judge appointed for that place, that conſideration may be had of thoſe men by our benignity; all which things we Will and Command that you ſee to be given and reſtored freely, and with diligence unto the ſociety of the Chriſtians, all delay ſet apart; And becauſe the Chriſtians themſelves are underſtood to have had not only thoſe places wherein they were accuſtomed to reſort together, but certain other peculiar places alſo, not being private to any one man, but belonging to the right of their Congregation and Society; You ſhall ſee alſo all thoſe to be reſtored unto the Chriſtians, that is to ſay, to every Fellowſhip and Company of them, according to the Decree whereof we have made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all delay ſet apart; Provided that the order we have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the mean time be obſerved, that if any, taking no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, ſhall reſtore the ſame Lands and Poſſeſſions, they ſhall not miſtruſt, but be ſure to be ſaved harmleſſe by us. In all theſe things it ſhall be your part to employ your diligence in the behalf of the foreſaid company of Chriſtians, wherby this our commandment may ſpeedily be accompliſhed, and alſo in this caſe by our clemency the common and publick peace may be preſerved; for undoubtedly by this means, as before we have ſaid, the good will and favour of God towards us (whereof in many caſes we have had good experience) ſhall alwayes conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue with us; And to the intent that this our Conſtitution may be notified to all men, it ſhall be requiſite that the copy of theſe our Letters be ſet up in all places, that men may read and know the ſame, leaſt any ſhould be ignorant thereof.</p>
