            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>O Heavens! and to spite so gentile a Mirth too, as might represent the acceptable diversion of <hi>Newmarket!</hi> By the best Muse now extant, I am apt to believe they would not allow their King neither so much true Comedy as to provoke his smile, (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their License) durst they own so presumptuous a Censure.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Shat.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, and by their wills would onely allow so many Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by Retail, or Trade-Poets, though we Actors have paid dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough for some of the best of their Compositions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Haines.</speaker>
               <p>Let me never utter proper sence on the Stage more, if I know what definition can square with these men of Pudder call'd Wits; or I suppose it at least as hard as to describe all the variety of Butter-flies the world abounds with.</p>

               <speaker>Shat.</speaker>
               <p>I care not if I help thee; and next be it known to all (whose Pates are not over-discompos'd by the extravagant itch of their imaginary Brain-worms) that there are at this day in being, in spite of ingenuity and some good manners, a sort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple call'd Wits and Sub-wits or Criticks, and Sub-criticks; and these again divided into Poets and Sub-poets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Haines.</speaker>
               <p>A series indeed! but to pass the rest, prethee tell me what thou meanest by a Sub-wit, or Sub-poet.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Shat.</speaker>
               <p>Why, both or either of them make but in effect one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Zany to some Grand Wit-monger.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Haines.</speaker>
               <p>And so compleat their office by some allow'd Jest or Raillery, when their conceits are so happy as to come by it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Shat.</speaker>
               <p>What else, man? allowing this difference, that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poet whensoever he writes, he must refer his Papers (with some tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) to their inquisition. After which perhaps, to spite a better Muse, they may give his the applause of a favour'd bad one.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Haines.</speaker>
               <p>And had but this Poet a little collogu'd with this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Cabal, and next suffer'd his Wit to be cut, lin'd, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlin'd at pleasure, we might have perform'd his Play with some security. I could scratch my Pate to think it was omitted.</p>

               <speaker>Shat.</speaker>
               <p>Alas for the Gentleman, he has otherwise satisfi'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and is content we wave his Play, and act another.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Haines.</speaker>
               <p>Well remembred, and that shall be the Comedy, <hi>alias</hi> Farce, that has lately past the test of some notorious Town-wits: Thou know'st we are perfect in it already.</p>

            <l>'Tis thought may last at least this Ages life.</l>
            <l>Or like the long disputes 'twixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Besides their Allies, and the wrong'd <hi>Lorain:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Not all know which with better sence contest,</l>
            <l>Though most the weaker side allow the best.</l>
            <l>And thus they sometimes rail, and sometimes fight,</l>
            <l>Until a juster Power compose their might.</l>
            <l>Such a Confederate we wish for here;</l>
            <l>And though from <hi>Nimmegen</hi> there none appear,</l>
            <l>Yet something to comply you is design'd,</l>
            <l>A Jest you'll say indeed to make you kind.</l>
            <l>But 'tis no matter—or yet stay a while,</l>
            <l>We may have those, to spite your Wit, can smile.</l>
            <l>Perhaps, intreated from <hi>Newmarket</hi> too,</l>
            <l>To Sham you here, as there they others do.</l>
            <l>Nor is it just to blame our Poet's Art,</l>
            <l>If here, without your leave, he gets the Start.</l>

               <p>FEllow Horsemen, let's embrace heartily. Thanks be to Heaven, we have not many hours to spend in this Metropolitan Wilderness of Houses, call'd <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> an open Air fits our flesh and blood, and sports together, much better.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Or to be plain, Brother, any ground of <hi>England</hi> that affords but good galloping after Water. The Stones of Cities are more ill-natur'd to the Constitution and Feet of Horses, than the Souls of the Inhabitants are to one another. Let me never cross good Runner more, if I do any thing but dream of four-mile Plains, shapes of Horses, and their pleasant Courses on them, this tedious night that we have been in <hi>London.</hi>

               <p>There I am with thee heartily. The very ruminating on the last sport we happily beheld at <hi>Salisbury, Winchester,</hi> and some other places, did so fill and quicken my drowsie thoughts with this Match, and t'other Match; nay, in my Conscience, I
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49890:6"/>
took my Whip in my Hand, and sometimes in my dream lashed the Bed-post heartily, as if I had been in hard running; after which, I was so indisposed, I know not how, this very Morning, that when the Tapster's plump Wife came up with my mornings draught, I had scarce the heart to kiss her. But O sweet, sweet, <hi>Newmarket!</hi> had I met with but half the temptation there, I had rode a Heat indeed.</p>

               <p>Well, God a mercy our Good King, who guides himself and them to the happy place of Pleasure call'd <hi>Newmarket.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would say else (in despight of any Browantled Cockney of 'em all) that this City might otherwise prejudice the health of the best Prince that ever Subjects enjoy'd.</p>

               <p>The very Candle-light that he employes in this place, shall be but to light him to make Matches and Betts. His Soul and Being is too much with his Coursers to be deluded otherwise, I warrant him.</p>

            <sp>

               </speaker>
               <p>Then, let it go so, they are Gentlemen; two such Sports I confess may be allow'd one after t'other with conveniency.</p>

               <p>What else, Lads? There are times of Heat and Frost, when Horses cannot exercise, wherein their Masters, as well as we Keepers, may be humour'd otherwise: Good Drink and Girls are never out of season with true Coursers; Is't not so, Boys?</p>

               <p>I may perhaps, and hopefully too: But to come near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er your purpose, I finde the Lady of your Address has some scruples slip from her I know not how: She's beautiful, and that implies a handsome something; or at worst, joyn'd to a more tolerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significacy, the very pleasure that some may take, even of our Sex, so they be held improper and useful together, either to Church or State.</p>

               <p>'Tis true, she hinted something of Money and Prayers, but I would not have you start at her devotion therefore. Perhaps she may be of all, or of no Religion, as is common with some beautiful and parsimonious Ladies: There's an excess, or intricate delight, in some sense allowable to most Complexions.</p>

Believe me, Sir, it shall guide my civil being.

               <p>To be short, with a few good words and more Silver, I have reduc'd that legal sort of Knave to so much Conscience, as not to molest the King's loving Subjects of Men and Women: Or to think that at one, two, or three a Clock in the Morning they may not have their Congressions without his leave, or a shilling for him and his Watch to drink. I have some thought to make my Applications to Justices of the Peace to the same purpose. 'Tis such a crime to nature to think that Mankinde should live and love orderly—</p>

            <l>I bring the Epilogue along with me.</l>
            <l>And I have been, as I presume you'll say,</l>
            <l>As merry as most Ladies in a Play;</l>
            <l>And'tis loves Mirth best suits the Comick way.</l>
            <l>Nor doubt I, Ladies, but 'tis known to you,</l>
            <l>That some <hi>Newmarket-</hi>lads are Lovers too.</l>
            <l>Men that quick pleasures swiftly can imploy,</l>
            <l>Most Women graut their speed, their love enjoy.</l>
            <l>Wit they pretend to, as you Gallants do,</l>
            <l>Who, though call'd Wits, like them lose money too.</l>
            <l>Yet know in Matches no such booty way's,</l>
            <l>As they who here cry up or damn our Play's.</l>
            <l>Then Criticks have a care what you commit,</l>
            <l>Lest here our Jockeys with you wager Wit.</l>
            <l>They know your stingy slights, and how inclin'd,</l>
            <l>And what to Crony Poets is design'd;</l>
            <l>Whilst this our Author does by me afford</l>
            <l>Not so much for his Play as one kinde word.</l>
            <l>Or tells you that his Scenes or Wit are new,</l>
            <l>Which some, that boast much wit, want wit to shew.</l>
            <l>We for a Play such Wits did all approve,</l>
            <l>Got little Money, we playd all for Love.</l>
