         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <p>THe two Princeſſes, <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> compare
their Misfortunes, and compaſſionate and comfort
one another. <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> out of her Love to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
and the Deſire ſhe had to be acquainted
with her future Relations, entreats <hi>Cleopatra</hi> to give
her an account of her Brothers and Siſters. <hi>Cleopatra</hi>
relates the Hiſtory of <hi>Julius Antonius, Antonia</hi> and young
<hi>Ptolomy. Julius Antonius,</hi> riding a hunting one day,
is thrown by his Horſe, and relieved by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Lady, whom he falls paſſionately in love with.
<hi>Lucius Scipio</hi> is in love with <hi>Emilia,</hi> the Daughter of
<hi>Statilius Scaurus.</hi> Being a friend of <hi>Antonius's,</hi> he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
him to ſee his Miſtreſſe, where, by a fatall chance,
he meets with the unknown Lady, who proves to be <hi>Tullia,</hi>
the Daughter of <hi>Cicero.</hi> She abhors <hi>Antonius,</hi> as being
the Son of <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Fulvia,</hi> who had put <hi>Cicero</hi> to an
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97242:4"/>
ignominious and cruel death. <hi>Tullia</hi> is courted by <hi>Cecinna,</hi>
with the approbation of her brother <hi>Quintus Cicero,</hi>
who bringing her one day to the Amphitheatre, to ſee the
combats of certain beaſts, <hi>Antonius</hi> hath another ſight of
her, but is much troubled at her kindneſſe to <hi>Cecinna.</hi>

and takes it up: but bringing it to her, out of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
ſhe would take that expreſſion of his love with
civility, if not with kindneſſe, ſhe, out of the horrid
averſion ſhe had for him, would not receive it: whereupon
he keeps it, proteſting he would never reſtore it to any
hands but her own. <hi>Cecinna,</hi> meeting him afterwards
alone, demands the box of him, which <hi>Antonius</hi> refuſing
to deliver him, it begat a duel, wherein <hi>Cecinna</hi> is killed.

                     <p>THe ſlumber of the two fair Princeſſes could not
be long, not onely becauſe the night was far
ſpent before they fell aſleep, but alſo becauſe
the importunate reſentment of their misfortune
would not permit a reſt of any great conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance.
They had hardly opened their bright
eyes to receive in the light, but they opened them withal to let
out tears: and it could hardly be diſcerned whether came
out of their mouths firſt, or certain broken fighes, or ſome
mournful expreſſions. The dawning muſt needs be full of
affliction, that was to be delivered of a day ſo fatal to theſe
two deſolate Princeſſes: for neither could the great courage of
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> nor the reſignation of <hi>Artemiſa</hi> fortifie them, ſo as
to entertain with conſtancy, the firſt idaea that preſented it ſelf
to their imaginations, of the miſery they were to expect.
<hi>Artemiſa,</hi> having been awake ſome few minutes, and beſtowed
her firſt reflections on the memory of her <hi>Alexander,</hi> turns to
the Princeſſe <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and putting forth her arm to embrace her,
ſhe felt her give a little ſtart, and turning from her to the other
ſide with a certain action, wherein ſhe obſerved no ſmall diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance;
Thinking her ſelf obliged to be as tender of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
of that dear Siſter of hers, as of her own: ſhe haſtily
asked her the reaſon of it; and the fair Daughter of <hi>Anthony,</hi>
uſhering in her anſwer with certain ſighs, Siſter, ſaid ſhe
to her, the affliction I am in does not onely diſturb my reaſon,
but it is as unmerciful to my ſenſes, and my deluded imagination;
having while I ſlept entertained me with the idaea of <hi>Coriolanu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

hath brought into my ears, the ſound of his very voice, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97242:5"/>
cauſed me to hear certain words, which I ſhould be confident
could proceed from no other mouth then his: were I not now
ſatisfied, to my confuſion, that it is onely to my imagination, that
I muſt attribute theſe deplorable effects of my affliction. <hi>Inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable,
and yet unfortunate Princeſs, (ſaies that known voice) I
muſt then be content to looſe you for ever.</hi> Theſe few words are
all I heard, or, to ſay better, thought I heard, but the ſound, I
have ſome time been ſo well acquainted with, hath made ſuch
an impreſſion in my hearing, that, with all the aſſiſtance of my
reaſon, I can hardly be perſwaded, that I have not heard the
very voice of <hi>Coriolanus.</hi> 'Twas with that reflection that I
ſtarted as you felt, and turning to you that I looked wiſh'dly
about me through that remainder of the impreſſion, which my
errour had left in my thoughts.</p>
                     <p>Such was the diſcourſe of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and <hi>Artemiſa</hi> approved
her opinion: but it was not long ere ſhe fell into another ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
which might have added very much to her affliction,
had ſhe faſtened her thoughts on it: for ſhe imagined for ſome
minutes, that <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> killed in the combat wherein ſhe had
left him ingaged; it might haply be that his ſpirit, wandring
about that which he had ſome time dearly loved, had entertained
her with thoſe paſſionate words. This reflection found at firſt
ſome little entertainment in her mind, and might have done abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of miſchief there, had ſhe afforded it any long entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
but that being ſuch in her, as was not capable of ordinary
weakneſſe, that extravagance was ſoon diſpell'd by the light of her
reaſon, and communicated to <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> who gave it more credit
then ſhe had done. For the <hi>Armenian</hi> Princeſſe was eaſily drawn
in, to think the opinion very probable, and ſoon perſwaded, that if
it were true, that <hi>Cleopatra</hi> had heard certain words pronounced
by a voice, like that of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> 'twas, queſtionleſſe, the ſpirit
of that unfortunate Prince, dead in the combat, wherein they had
left him with little aſſurance of his ſafety, that ſpoke them to the
Princeſſe he had ſo dearly loved while he lived, and whom haply he
ſtill loved, even after his death. From the opinion ſhe had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved
of the death of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> ſhe derived all the affliction her
vertue could give her for a Prince, whoſe extraordinary endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
deſerved a better fate, and the friendſhip ſhe had for <hi>Cleopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi>
for a man, who (how angry ſoever ſhe might ſeem to be, and
how highly ſoever ſhe might diſguiſe her ſentiments) was much
dearer to her, than her life. Certain it is, that what ſenſe ſoever
ſhe might have of her own misfortunes, it abated nothing of what
ſhe conceaved for ſo great a loſſe, ſo that to the tears ſhe ſhed for
her own unhappineſſe, ſhe added ſome for the death of <hi>Juba's</hi>
ſon. But when, reflecting on her fortune, ſhe paſſed from one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
to another, and was ſatisfied that ſhe might mind her
own intereſt with thoſe of others, without any breach either of
friendſhip or generoſity, ſhe thought, that, if <hi>Coriolanus</hi> were, for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97242:5"/>
certain, dead, (an accident ſhe neither could nor would conceave,
without an extraordinary affliction) it might occaſion no inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
alteration in <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s condition and her own, and that, it
being not impoſſible, <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s inclinations might change, when
the object of her affections were in the grave, if ſhe could conſider
the love of the King her Brother, with other eyes than ſhe had done
before, and be perſwaded by time and neceſſity to marry him, that
Prince, how exaſperated ſoever he might be againſt <hi>Artemiſa</hi>
sand <hi>Alexander,</hi> would not onely pardon them for <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s ſake,
but would, no doubt, confirm their marriage, and ſuffer them to
enjoy in quiet what they had ſought with ſo much trouble and
danger. To this happineſſe would be added alſo that of having
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> for whom ſhe had a paſſionate affection, her Siſter two
ſeveral wayes: inſomuch, that this reflection flattered her into
a hope that was not unpleaſant. True it is, that ſhe could not
raiſe it to that height, as to reflect on the death of <hi>Coriolanus</hi>
without grief, but rather that ſhe was content to ſeek out ſome
comfort in her misfortunes, without intrenching ſo much as to
the leaſt wiſh, upon what ſhe ought the vertue and friendſhip of
<hi>Cleopatra.</hi> Yet durſt ſhe not communicate this reflection to the
deſolate daughter of <hi>Anthony,</hi> conceiving, not without reaſon,
that ſuch a Diſcourſe would not be delightful to her: but ſhe
felt her reſolution growing ſtronger and ſtronger by that glimpſe
of hope, betrayed in her countenance, more ſetledneſſe and leſſe
ſorrow, then ſhe had done the day, nay indeed, for ſome minutes,
before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This little alteration happened in her thoughts, at the ſame
time that thoſe of</hi> Cleopatra <hi>met with ſuch another; for that fair
Princeſſe, out of motives quite contrary to thoſe of</hi> Artemiſa,
<hi>had juſt then faſtned on reſolutions worthy the</hi> Cleopatra's. <hi>She had
hardly well fixed on them, but, not able to diſguiſe them either by
her countenance or her diſcourſe, ſhe embraced</hi> Artemiſa, <hi>with a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
leſſe ſad than all the precedent; and letting her rend in her
eies part of what paſſed in her ſoule, Siſter, ſaid ſhe to her,</hi> Let
us not weep any longer, but rather hope, from the aſſiſtance of the
Gods and our own Courage, the remedy of our misfortunes; it may
be our unhappineſſe will not be ſo great as we were afraid it may;
and if our hard fates reſerve us for what we fear us moſt inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
we ſhall not want the aſſiſtance of our vertue, either to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
or to entertain it as we ought. For your part, <hi>Siſter,</hi> I hope
it will be no hard matter to pacifie the King your Brother, and I
think it not impoſſible, you and Alexander may come together<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and
for me, I can eaſily contemn whatever may happen to me, when I do
life it ſelfe. Ever ſince the cruell confidence I have had of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> I value it ſo little that I ſhould not be much
troubled to looſe it, when ever it ſhall pleaſe my ill fortune to put <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>
into any ſuch exigency; and if the King your Brother violates the
reſpect due to me, or do any thing that ſhall make my captivity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97242:6"/>
to me, I ſhall free my ſelfe by the ſame courſes the Queen my
mother took to avoid it; and I have that example ſo much before my
eies that I were unworthy the name I bear, ſhould I ſeek for aſſiſtance
any where elſe while I have that of my own courage. This reſolution
once taken, I no longer fear the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and ſince I hope no
more of <hi>Coriolanus</hi> whether dead or unfaithful, I look on whatever may
happen to me in a manner with indifference, and ſhal entertain it haply
with a conſtancy whereof the very example mayadde much to yours.</p>
                     <p>No doubt but <hi>Artemiſa</hi> found ſome comfort in this diſcourſe of
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> not that ſhe approved that hope, which the daughter
of <hi>Anthony</hi> grounded onely on a contempt of life, but was glad to
ſee her in a quieter poſture then ſhe had been in before: and
though ſhe had not the confidence to diſcover to her the reflection
that had found her the entertainment of ſome few minutes, yet
was ſhe of a belief that time might ſo diſpoſe of her as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
ſuch a diſcourſe, and that in the mean time ſhe might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a converſation leſſe afflictive than that wherein they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
paſſed away ſo many cruell houres. Accordingly, no ſooner
were theſe two Princeſſes reſolved to ſubmit to what the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of fortune might caſt upon them, but they ſeemed to be
quite changed from what they were; the current of their teares
was dried up, and by degrees they paſſed to ſome diſcourſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from that of their preſent misfortune. Yet could not <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſa</hi>
give over diſputing in favour of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> and would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
againſt <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> that after the laſt expreſſions he had given
her of his affection, in his forſaking of his kingdom, the trouble
it was to him to wander up and down the earth to find her out,
and the late combat he was engaged in before their eyes, againſt
thoſe that would have raviſhed them, ſhe could not be
perſwaded he was unfaithful to her. <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> who would
gladly have been induced to believe <hi>Coriolanus</hi> innocent, oppoſed
what ſhe ſaid with the reaſons before alleadged, yet ſo as that
through her arguments, might be perceaved part of what <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſa</hi>
repreſented in his favour. But at laſt this diſcourſe of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
of whoſe life there was much uncertainty, adding to her grief,
ſhe would needs change it, and put <hi>Artemiſa</hi> upon ſome other.</p>
                     <p>The love which that Princeſſe had for <hi>Alexander,</hi> made her
deſirous to know, and willing to hearken to any thing that related
to his family, as if ſhe had ſome concernment therein; and that
conſiſting of divers illuſtrious perſons of both ſexes, <hi>Artemiſa,</hi>
who had ſeen onely <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and young <hi>Ptolomey,</hi>
while yet a child, had the curioſity to deſire ſome account of the
Siſters and Brothers of her beloved Prince. She had not the time
to underſtand the particularities of their lives and fortunes, (for
what ſhe had heard from <hi>Alexander,</hi> related to the time while
they were yet very young, and not what had happened to them
ſince his departure from <hi>Rome</hi>) but though ſhe would gladly have
been informed of all, yet had ſhe a more particular inclination for
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97242:6"/>
the Princeſſe <hi>Antonia,</hi> whom <hi>Cleopatra</hi> had mentioned very much
to her advantage in her own Hiſtory, and young, <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> of
whom ſhe had heard ſuch beginnings, as gave many occaſion
to conceave very great hopes of him. <hi>Cleopatra</hi> ſatisfied her as
to all ſhe deſired; but afterwards obſerving her deſign was to
have a more particular knowledge of them, and thinking it cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
not to comply with the affection ſhe expreſſed towards her
houſe: <hi>Siſter,</hi> ſaid ſhe to her, <hi>I perceave you are not ſatisfied with the
account</hi> I <hi>have given you of our houſe, and if we were in ſome other
place, I had already entertained you with the diſcourſe, you would put
me upon, of the fortunes of our neereſt relations: but, Siſter, the likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood

but <hi>Camilla</hi> is able to acquaint you with part of what you deſire,
and would entertain you with adventures, ſuch as muſt needs be
known to the perſons that were about us: but ſhe cannot poſſibly
give you an account of ſome particularities, that haply went no
farther then my knowledge, ſince it was to me more than any one
elſe, that the perſons now to be ſpoken of, communicated their moſt
ſecret ſentiments, and that it was in a manner in my preſence, that
the greateſt part of the things happened. The relation will haply
be ſomewhat long, (though it may not contain any great variety of
adventures, and that in all likelihood I ſhall not be able to leave off
when I would) but ſince I made a ſhift yeſterday to continue that
which I had begun, of the Hiſtory of my own misfortunes, I hope
I ſhall be as able to go through with this, and I ſhall endeavour all
that lies in my power not to omit any thing that may any way ſatisfie
your curioſity. <hi>Whereupon</hi> Cleopatra, <hi>preparing her ſelf for the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,

                        <head>THE
HISTORY
OF
JULIVS ANTONIUS,
ANTONIA and PTOLOMEY.</head>
                        <p>BEfore I give you the account you deſire of the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of <hi>Ptolomey</hi> and <hi>Antonia,</hi> it will not be amiſſe,
Siſter, to make mention of an Elder Brother we have
had, and whom haply we have yet, though I ſaid litle
of him in my own Hiſtory, in regard it is ſo long time
ſince we have either ſeen or heard of him, that we
have acted hitherto as if there were no ſuch perſon in the World.
His beginning diſcovered him not to be unworthy the bloud of
<hi>Anthony,</hi> and all things in him were great enough to reſcue him
from the oblivion of his neereſt relations. But before I acquaint
you with the firſt beginnings of his life, and the ſtrange accident
whereby we loſt him, I ſhall tell you what condition the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<hi>Antony</hi> left his family in when he dyed, though I doubt not
but you have heard ſomething of it from <hi>Alexander.</hi> I am eaſily
perſwaded, Siſter, you are not to learn how that <hi>Anthony</hi> left
ſeaven children by three wives, by <hi>Fulvia,</hi> who was the firſt,
<hi>Antillus,</hi> and <hi>Julius Antonius,</hi> by <hi>Octavia, Caeſar</hi>'s Siſter, the two
Princeſſes, <hi>Agrippina</hi> and <hi>Antonia;</hi> and by Queen <hi>Cleopatra,
Alexander, Ptolomey,</hi> and my ſelf. For the two daughters by
<hi>Octavia,</hi> and for us, the iſſue of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> we all had our educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
together, in the houſe of that Vertuous Princeſſe, with all
the civilities and kindneſſes that could be expected from a moſt
affectionate mother; and as to the two children of <hi>Fulvia,
Antillus</hi> was killed not long after the death of our Father, by
<hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Souldiers, (his fate having proved not unlike that of our
Brother <hi>Caeſarion,</hi> whoſe firſt eruptions, and the great inclinations
he diſcovered, raiſed ſome jealouſie of him in <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> who for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97242:7"/>
that reaſon took away his life) and <hi>Julius Antonius</hi> was provided
for as we were by the indulgent <hi>Octavia,</hi> and not long after poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
of the houſe of <hi>Fulvia,</hi> and all the eſtate belonging there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
with an addition of ſomewhat out of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s. To be
ſhort, his condition was ſuch, that he needed not envy the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
of any <hi>Roman</hi> whatſoever, and though he had not thoſe
Kingdoms at his diſpoſal, which had been at his Fathers, yet did
he keep up our houſe in the greateſt luſtre it ever was in before
the death of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> and before <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus</hi> made
themſelves Maſters of the Empire. He was elder then <hi>Alexander</hi>
and my ſelf by ſeaven or eight years, inſomuch, that within a
ſhort time after our misfortune, and while we were yet brought
up as children by <hi>Octavia,</hi> he was numbred among the young
Princes that pretended to employments and opportunities of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
fame. He was certainly born to all the nobleſt and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
endowments, and though he were not ſo <hi>fair</hi> as <hi>Alexander,</hi> yet
had he a high and majeſtick look, was of a proper ſtature, and
wanted not any of thoſe advantages, either of body or mind,
which could rationally be wiſhed in him. With this, his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were abſolutely noble, he was wholly diſpoſed to the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of vertue, and an earneſt ſuitor to thoſe opportunities
which lead a man to glory. We cannot indeed complain, but
that he expreſſed as great affection towards us, as we could
expect from a Brother, and him a vertuous one: but in
regard we were of ſeveral venter's, lived in ſeveral houſes, nay,
that ours was in ſome ſort divided between him and us, and that
even among the kindred of <hi>Fulvia,</hi> there was no ſmall averſion
for the name of <hi>Cleopatra;</hi> certain it is, that our familiarity was
ſo much the leſſe with him, and that he concerned himſelf leſſe in
our Affairs, then if our family had not been diſunited, which is
the reaſon that you have had ſo little mention made of him in the
firſt beginnings of the life of <hi>Alexander</hi> and mine. Whence yet
I would not have it thought, as I told you, that we can reproach
<hi>Julius Antonius</hi> with any backwardneſſe to do all the civilities and
good offices we could expect from his friendſhip; but that when any
great emergencies interven'd, he was no longer among us; and it is
upon that account that I have been deſtitute of his aſſiſtances in all
thoſe occaſions which the love of <hi>Coriolanus</hi> hath furniſhed me with,
to make uſe of them, &amp; of which I have already made you a relation.</p>
                        <p>You have, I queſtion not, underſtood, from <hi>Alexander,</hi> as alſo
from me, all the particularities of our younger years; but to
give you an account of <hi>Julius Antonius,</hi> I am to tell you, that
after he had attained perfection in all thoſe exerciſes, that are
proper to perſons of his birth, he was no ſooner arrived to an age
fit to bear arms, but he ſought out the wars with much earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and engaging himſelf in the armies of <hi>Dalmatia, Pannonia,</hi>
as alſo that which <hi>Marcus Craſſus</hi> conducted againſt the <hi>Baſternae,</hi>
and having gone through all employments and charges ſuitable to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97242:8"/>
his age, with all the good ſucceſſe imaginable, he acquired a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
fame, and gave the World ground to conceave as glorious
hopes of him as of any other whatſoever. Being, after ſeveral
years ſpent in travel, returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> he ſetled there, and was
honoured by all, nay wanted not from <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf more then
ordinary expreſſions of eſteem and affection. He was at firſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
at the Court among perſons of the higheſt rank, ſo far,
that onely <hi>Marcellus,</hi> and the children of <hi>Livia,</hi> particularly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſeemed, by reaſon of the advantage of their
fortune, to aim at higher pretences. His expence was noble and
magnificent, his diſpoſition inclined to do civilities and to oblige,
and his whole deportment, ſuch as all the World approved, and
were ſatisfied with. Accordingly, he ſoon got him a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of friends, and, thoſe onely excepted, whom the diviſions of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and the diſtractions of the <hi>Triumvirate</hi> had made irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable
enemies to our houſe, there were very few of the Roman
Nobility, who had not a particular eſteem for him, and courted
not his friendſhip. When he went to <hi>Auguſtus's</hi> Palace, he was
attended by a gallant retinue of young Gentlemen. In all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
ſhews, and all Aſſemblies that met either at the Empreſſes, or
at the young Princeſſe <hi>Julia</hi>'s, he alwayes had the general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations,
and it was already the ordinary talk in <hi>Rome,</hi> that, if
Fortune were any thing favourable to him, he would raiſe the
houſe of <hi>Anthony</hi> to the height of luſtre it had been in ſome few
years before. But it was not the pleaſure of the gods, he ſhould
continue long in that condition, and the quiet that he himſelf loſt
after a very ſtrange manner, proved the occaſion of our loſing of
him, to our no ſmall grief. Now, Siſter, ſhall you hear ſomething
which you will haply be aſtoniſhed at, as to the parallel you will
find there is between the fate of <hi>Alexander</hi> and that of <hi>Antonius;</hi>
whence you will haply imagine, that Fortune treating them as
Brothers, would needs have ſome conformity between their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures.</p>
                        <p>Among thoſe exerciſes of the body he was moſt addicted to,
<hi>Antonius</hi> was the greateſt lover of hunting, and uſed it very often.
To that end being gone a dayes journy from <hi>Rome</hi> on the <hi>Tuſculum</hi>
ſide, where the Country is very pleaſant, and very fit for that kind
of divertiſement, he paſſed away certain dayes there, with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of ſatisfaction. The laſt of thoſe he intended, to beſtow
on that exerciſe, being, as he was hunting a Stagge, forced to croſſe
certain woods in the purſuit, he came into a very pleaſant valley,
where putting on his Horſe very negligently down a little deſcent,
and along the ſlippery graſſe, he ſtumbled, but ſo of a ſudden,
that he could not get his feet out of the ſtirrops, nor prevent the
horſe from falling upon him ſo violently, that having knocked his
head againſt the root of a tree, he was not onely ſenſe-leſſe for the
time, but receaved alſo a very conſiderable wound. A further
misfortune was, that none of his fellow-huntſmen being mounted
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97242:8"/>
comparably to him, or having taken other wayes, there was not
any one of his people neer him, to afford him any aſſiſtance in that
condition, ſo that he lay groveling on the ground, ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
looſing bloud; and being much in need of help, when cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
perſons that paſſed by in a Chariot, in a way not far off, drew
neerer, and came out of the Chariot to relieve him. They were
in number three, and they women, without any man with them,
but he that drove the Chariot, and certain ſlaves that followed it.
She of the women that ſeemed to be of the greateſt quality, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaving
my Brother to be in the ſad condition I told you of, was
extreamly troubled for him, and concluding otherwiſe by his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and the ſumptuouſneſſe of his cloaths, (though he had
onely a riding-ſuit on) that he was of no mean condition, ſhe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
very much inclined to do him all the good ſhe could. She firſt
looked on the wound in his head, which ſhe found not to be very
dangerous, yet did ſhe not think it amiſſe to put ſome linnen to it,
which ſhe tore off the cloaths of her maids.</p>
                        <p>While ſhe was thus employed, <hi>Antonius,</hi> whoſe greateſt hurt
proceeded from the ſenſe-leſſeneſſe he had been in, comes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and opening his eyes, ſaw that he was under the hands of thoſe
fair and officious Surgeonneſſes. He was not a little aſtoniſhed at
the adventure, and though he were in ſome doubt of the truth,
nay, remembred that he had ſeen the Chariot as he came into the
Valley, yet could he neither forbear being ſurprized at the firſt, nor
afterwards divert the amazement with the ſight of ſo beautiful a
perſon, as ſhe that ſtood by him, put him into. He caſt his eyes upon
her, yet without ſpeaking, and viewed her all over ſeveral times,
in ſuch a manner, as eaſily betrayed his admiration. He had indeed
ſome reaſon to look on her with a particular attention, for there
was both in her countenance and her perſon, what might very well
faſten the eye, and fetter the imagination. Her ſtature was of the
nobleſt, and her deportment diſcovered a certain grace that was
wholly particular. All the features of her face were regularly
well drawn, her mouth extreamely handſome, her hair of the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſlaxen that could be, and her eyes were animated by ſomething
ſo ſparkling, and with all ſo paſſionate, that, among the greateſt
Beauties the earth affords, there is not haply any one ſo fit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a ſudden effect, and to imprint ſomething of paſſion in a ſoul
capable thereof. In fine, whether ſhe were truly ſuch, or that the
inclinations of <hi>Antonius</hi> repreſented her as ſuch, ſhe ſeemed to him
a very Admirable Perſon, and he looked on her a long time with
a certain aſtoniſhment, without ſo much as being able to open his
mouth to acknowledge the good office ſhe had done him. But at
laſt he abſolutely recovers himſelf as well of his ſurprize, as the
ſenſe-leſſeneſſe occaſioned by his fall; and conceaving himſelf to
be in a very undecent poſture, before a perſon he thought worthy
all poſſible reſpects, he would needs riſe up, but he could not do it
without ſome difficulty, as having his leg a little cruſhed by the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97242:9"/>
horſe that had fallen upon it; inſomuch, that when he was got up,
being not well able to ſtand, he was forced to lean againſt a tree,
where, minding not ſo much the pain he felt, as the noble adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
he had met with, he at laſt broke forth, and looking on that
fair Lady, with an action that already ſpoke ſomething that argued
abundance of paſſion, <hi>I know not,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>fair, or rather,
divine, Lady, what acknowledgments I ought to return your Goodneſs,
for words will be but weak expreſſions thereof, if you do me not an
abſolute favour, by affording me ſome occaſion to return you part of
what I owe you. The aſſiſtance you have receaved from me,</hi> replies
that excellent perſon, with ſuch an accent as diſcovered ſomething
ful of charm, <hi>is no more then what we are obliged to do to all thoſe that
ſtand ſo much in need thereof as you did, and particularly to thoſe,
who, as you, carry about them what diſtinguiſhes them from the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
rate of men. Your preſent condition is not, as far as I can judge,
very good, and therefore if you pleaſe to make uſe of my Chariot, I
will bring you to a place, where you may receave the helps you ſtand in
need of, better then you can here.</hi> Theſe words came from her (as
<hi>Antonius</hi> hath related ſince) with ſo much kindneſſe, inſinuation
and majeſty, that he was infinitely taken with it, and felt at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
the ſudden quickening of a paſſion, which till then could
never get entrance into his ſoul; inſomuch that he began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
her again with a geſture that expreſſed part of what he felt,
and thinking it a diſhonour not to returne ſome anſwer to ſo obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
a Proffer. <hi>I have not been able,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>to reſiſt the
effects of your goodneſſe, nor prevent your hands from taking the pains
they have, becauſe I was in a condition that allowed me not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of your favours; but how precious ſoever I ought to account
them, I ſhall not preſume ſo far upon you as to abuſe them, but be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to preſerve, till death deprive me of it, the glorious remembrance
of thoſe I have receaved, without deſiring any other of you,
which, being troubleſome to you, might too much betray my inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus did he endeavour to put off the civility of the Unknown
Lady, wherewith yet he was at laſt willing to comply, out of the
violent inclination he had to follow her: but juſt upon this comes
in ſome of his people, and ſeeming to be not a little frighted at that
adventure, they came about their Maſter, viewing him all over
with much earneſtneſſe, and holding him up under the arms to help
him to walk. <hi>Antonius</hi> began to feel within him a wound, which
took up his thoughts more then the hurt of his body, and ſo was
deſirous, with the aſſiſtance of his men, to get near that fair Lady,
who was gone ſome few paces form him: but at the ſame time one
of her Maids, having before ſpoken to one of <hi>Antonius</hi> his men,
comes to her, and whiſpers ſomething in her ear. She had no
ſooner heard what ſhe ſaid, but her colour changed. She ſeemed
to be extreamly at a loſſe; inſomuch, that turning her back on the
Prince, after ſhe had called her ſlaves to her, ſhe went to her
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97242:9"/>
Chariot, got into it, commanded it ſhould be made faſt, and to
make all haſt thence. <hi>Antonius,</hi> more ſurprized at this accident
then he had been at the former, it raiſed in him a certain vexation
and aſtoniſhment, ſo that being ſtill between his people, he lift up
his voice, the better to be heard by that fair Lady: <hi>How, Madame,</hi>
ſaid he to her, <hi>do you forſake me ere you afford me the time to return
you my thanks? I forgive them you,</hi> replyed ſhe a little ſmartly, <hi>and
you ſtand no longer in need of my aſſiſtance.</hi> The Prince was not
able to maſter himſelf in the agitations, which ſo unexpected a
ſeparation cauſed in him, inſomuch, that his impatience was ſuch
that he ſpoke then what he would not haply have the confidence
to ſpeak in a long time, had he been in another condition. <hi>Ah
Madame,</hi> cry'd he, <hi>the pain I endure, is much greater than you imagine,
and the wound you have ſeen is very ſlight in compariſon of that which
you have given me. Alaſſe,</hi> continued he, ſeeing her departing, and
following her with his eyes, while ſhe made all the haſt ſhe could
away, <hi>muſt I loſe you ſo ſuddenly, and with ſo much cruelty, without
knowing either the cauſe of your departure, or my unhappineſſe?
What have I done? What have I attempted? Or what have I ſo much
as thought, that ſhould in a moment work a change in thoſe officious
inclinations? Have you perceaved in my heart the creation of your
own eyes there? Or have you diſcovered therein any thing ſo injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to your ſelf, as to arm, in an inſtant, with ſo much disdain, a mind
wherein I had found ſo much goodneſſe, and ſo much humanity?</hi>
Theſe words he ſcattered into the air, while the Chariot drove
on with all ſpeed, till that, not long after getting into a Wood, he
quite loſt the ſight of it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Antonius,</hi> over-preſſed with affliction, ſate him down on the graſs,
whereupon reflecting on his adventure, he found ſo much matter to
grieve at, that it was with much ado that he admitted any the leaſt
mitigation thereof. He was ignorant what motive could induce
a perſon ſo officious, and one that had made proffers to him ſo
full of obligation, after ſhe had aſſiſted him with her own
hands, to exchange ſo much indulgence into ſo much diſain; nay,
he was to ſeek who that fair, good-natured, and ſcornful perſon
was, from whom he had receaved ſo much good, and ſo much
hurt; and what compleated his affliction, was, that he could not
inform himſelf from any of his own people, who ingeniouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
they had not the curioſity to enquire, though one of her
Maids had come to them and learned his name, which it ſeems
they made no difficulty to tell her. <hi>Antonius</hi> blamed them a
hundred times for their ſtupidity, though they alledg'd by way of
excuſe, that the diſturbance which his fall had put them into, ſo
took up their thoughts, that they could reflect on nothing elſe.
Being therefore deſirous to do all that lay in his power to learn out
the name of a perſon, whoſe idaea was but too well engraven in
his heart, he commanded one of his men to get on horſe-back
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97242:10"/>
immediately, and ride after the tracks of the Chariot, and without
fail to find out ſome means or other to know the truth, and to
come and give him an account of it at a houſe of <hi>Servilius</hi>'s, which
he named to him, that lay about two hours riding from that place,
and upon the way to <hi>Rome.</hi> Having given him this order, he,
with the aſſiſtance of thoſe that were about him, got on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
and though it was with ſome difficultity that he ſate,
yet he made a ſhift to ride on eaſily towards <hi>Cervilius</hi>'s
houſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>It were a hard task for me to repreſent to you the different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
that exerciſed his thoughts all the way he rode; but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it is, as he hath himſelf acknowledged ſince, that though he
felt no ſmall pain in his body, yet he never ſo much as minded it;
and that he had ſo deeply graven in his heart the idaea of a perſon,
one while kind and obliging, and another, cruel and diſdainful,
and yet both in her mildneſſe, and in her ſcorn ever fair, and ever
full of charm, that he was not one minute without it.</hi> What a
fantaſtick adventure is this of mine? <hi>ſaid he,</hi> and what arms does
Fortune intend to take up againſt me? Ought I to ſee that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
perſon in a condition, wherein her good offices had begun,
what her fair eyes have compleated? or could my ſoul, prevented by
the obligation, be inſenſible as to beauty? But when I had ſeen her,
when I was obliged to her for her aſſiſtance, when her beauty had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
me with love, muſt I loſe her after ſo ſtrange a manner, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to all probability, contrary to all rational order? and, what I
think yet much more inſupportable, ſee her depart diſdainful, incenſed
and exaſperated, from a place, where ſome few minutes before ſhe had
appeared with ſo much goodneſſe? By what action have I incurred
her diſpleaſure? or what could ſhe diſcover in my perſon, which
ſhould oblige her ſo of a ſudden, to exchange her firſt ſentiments, for
ſuch as were abſolutely oppoſite thereto? Or is it poſſible ſhe may have
truly read in my eyes the love which I already feel for her, or
could ſhe look on that unexpected influence of her beauty, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
worthy her indignation, and this deportment of hers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Having thus for ſome time ſpent his thoughts on that part of his
adventure, and paſſing to the other;</hi> But is it poſſible, <hi>added he,</hi>
I ſhould commend, or be diſſatiſfyed with any one, and not know
whom I either commend, or am diſſatisfied with, and ſhall I be long
ignorant whom I ought to returne my thanks to, for the aſſiſtance I
have receaved, or whom I ought to complain of, for the wound
hath been given me? For in fine, I feel, and that not without ſome
confuſion, that I am really in love. Tis from the bloud of <hi>Mark-Anthony,</hi>
who lived and dyed the moſt amorous of mankind, that I
derive theſe ambrous inclinations, for had I not been born of him,
the charms of that Vnknown Beauty had not produced ſo unexpected
an effect.</p>
                        <p>Amidſt theſe reflections he comes to the houſe of <hi>Servilius,</hi> who
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97242:10"/>
chanced at that time to be there himſelf, and who having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
the accident had happened to him, cauſed him to be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a bed, and to be attended with as much care and affection as
might be. The hurt he had gotten by his fall was not ſo conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
inſomuch, that before he left <hi>Servilius</hi>'s houſe, which was
about two or three dayes after, he had very well recovered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
but that which troubled him moſt, was, that he could not
learn any thing of what he deſired from the perſon he had fent
after the Chariot, who had brought him no other account, then
that having loſt the track of it in the ſand, he had never been able
to recover it again; and that, notwithſtanding all the enquiry he
had made up and down the Villages thereabouts, yet could he not
meet with any tidings of it. So that my Brother, being ſtill as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
as he had been before, after he had deſcribed the place as well
as he could to <hi>Servilius,</hi> and given him all the marks whereby he
might poſſibly know it, could not meet with any ſatisfaction at all,
though <hi>Servilius,</hi> the more to humour him, had ſent for ſeveral
other perſons, and had very diligently enquired of all the Ladies
that might have any habitation near the place where the accident
had happened.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Antonius</hi> having taken a great deal of pains in this buſineſſe to no
purpoſe, returns to <hi>Rome</hi> with as much melancholy, and haply with
as much love as ever man could be capable of. He diſſembled
the cauſe of his affliction, as thinking it not fit to diſcover it, but
to ſome few perſons, that were his very intimate friends, who
were not a little aſtoniſhed at the adventure, and aſſiſted him what
lay in their power, to find out the name of the perſon, whoſe
image he had ſo deeply imprinted in his heart. <hi>Agrippa,</hi> to whom
he had made a relation of this ſtory, and who was his very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
friend, had ſome diſcourſe with him of it, when ever they
met together, and aſſiſted him what he could, (though as ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
as others) in the inquiſition he was ſo much bent upon. His
melancholy was remarkable, and obvious to all the World: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that thoſe who knew him to be naturally of a cheerful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
could not conceave upon what grounds his humour was
ſo changed of a ſudden. It being about ſix or ſeaven years ſince
what I relate to you happened, <hi>Alexander</hi> and I were too young
to be admitted of his Privy Councel, ſo that it is ſince that I came
to the knowledge of theſe particularities.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time <hi>Antonius,</hi> as to point of magnificence, lived
much after the rate he was wont to do. He went dayly to the
Emperour's Court, who had a very great eſteem and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for him; and whereas the generous <hi>Octavia,</hi> his Siſter, with
whom we were; notwithſtanding the ill treatment ſhe might
have receaved from our Father, had nevertheleſſe very great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
for his memory, ſhe was as earneſt for the advancement of
thoſe children that he had had by his other Wives, as ſhe could
have been for that of her own, and that meerly out of the exceſſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97242:11"/>
of vertue that was in her. Thence was it that ſhe had a deſign to
marry <hi>Antonius</hi> to one of the Daughters ſhe had had by <hi>Marcellus</hi>
her former Huſband, and who were brought up with us, without
any diſtinction, as if we had been really Siſters: as conceaving that
ſhe could not better diſpoſe of her Daughters then to beſtow them
on the Sons of her Huſband, or rather, that ſhe could not do any
thing more contributory to the advantage of the Son of <hi>Anthony</hi>
then, by making him her Son in law, to make him <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Nephew,
who was able to raiſe his fortunes to the higheſt pitch of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
It was indeed an admirable expreſſion of the indulgence
of <hi>Octavia,</hi> in regard that by way of addition to the merit of their
perſon, which yet is extraordinary, her Daughters, whether we
conſider their birth or their fortunes, were ſuch as there were no
men in the World, who would not have been proud to ſerve them,
upon the leaſt appearance of any ſuch pretention; nay, it might
haply be affirmed, that <hi>Julia</hi> onely excepted, they were the beſt
Matches in the World.</p>
                        <p>You may well imagine that <hi>Antonius</hi> being acquainted with that
goodneſſe of <hi>Octavia</hi> towards him, entertained it with all manner
of acknowledgement and reſpect; but by reaſon of the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
whereby he was a little diſordered, he receaved it not with
any great joy, but found it no ſmall difficulty to diſguiſe his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as he was obliged to do. His love was not haply raiſed to that
violence which it might have arrived to, by a further knowledge
of the perſon beloved; yet was it ſtrong enough to maintain the
Garriſon of his ſoul againſt the aſſaults and eruptions of another
paſſion, and to ſatisfie him, though not without an extraordinary
affliction, that, of neceſſity, he muſt either prove ungrateful to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Octavia,</hi> and oppoſe the advantages were intended him, or
reſolve to do a thing, which, how advantageous ſoever it were,
could not appear to be ſuch, nay, not indeed ſupportable to his
prepoſſeſſed imagination. But it being withall certain, that he
was a perſon of very great endowments, and a noble education, he
neglected not to do what he thought requiſite, to expreſſe his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements
to <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s Siſter, and forced his inclinations ſo
far, as to do all thoſe devoirs and civilities, which he thought
might be expected from him by the Princeſſe <hi>Marcella,</hi> ſo was
called the elder of the Daughters of <hi>Octavia</hi> by <hi>Marcellus</hi> her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Huſband. Twas indeed with abundance of prudence and
diſcretion, that he overcame the violence he did himſelf in that
particular; but it was withall eaſie to obſerve, that he made it
not his buſineſſe to aſſure himſelf of that good fortune ſo much
as in all appearance he ſhould have done; or rather that he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thoſe that were employed about it, to beſtir themſelves, he do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
little or nothing contributory thereto. Thoſe who made this
obſervation were very much aſtoniſhed at the diſ-activity he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in an affair of ſuch concernment to him, and inſtead of
imagining the true cauſe, were perſwaded that his indifference or
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97242:11"/>
backwardneſſe proceeded from the little inclination he naturally
had to marriage in general, againſt which he had been often
heard to ſpeak, and for which it was known he really had ſome
averſion.</p>
                        <p>But when he had done all he thought himſelf obliged to by
way of ſacriſice to that violence he had done his inclinations, and
had ſome hours freely to diſpoſe of, his diſcourſe ran upon his
misfortune, and his entertainment was of the ſtrange poſture of
his ſpirit, and the odde effects of his adventure. He did indeed
endeavour all he could, to force out of his thoughts the inevitable
Idaea which would have a place there, whether he would or no, and
was ſo prejudicial to his quiet and his eſtabliſhment. Nay I know
he did all that lay in his power, to get it thence, and it may be his
endeavours had, with the aſſiſtance of time and his reaſon, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
effectual, if he had not afterwards met with ſomething, that
inſtead of contributing to his recovery, confirmed him in his
paſſion.</p>
                        <p>Among thoſe friends whom he accounted his moſt intimate and
familiar, <hi>Lucius Scipio,</hi> of the illuſtrious houſe of the famous
<hi>Scipio</hi>'s, whoſe glory hath filled the univerſe, was the chiefeſt. He
was a perſon not unworthy the name he bore, as being one, that
while he was yet very young, the hope generally conceaved of
him, was, that he would not degenerate from his Anceſtors. He
had a violent paſſion for <hi>Emilia,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Statilius Scaurus,</hi>
and, being very free and open to <hi>Antonius,</hi> he had given him a
faithful account of the progreſſe of his love, and had carryed
him along with him to <hi>Emilia.</hi> But this affection of his being
of no long ſtanding; <hi>Antonius</hi>'s acquaintance at that houſe was
not very great, beſides that it was haply the leſſe, by reaſon it had
been contrary to our Fathers party; nay I think he had accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
<hi>Scipio</hi> but once thither. It is ſcituated upon the <hi>Tiber,</hi> and
the Garden, which is one of the faireſt about <hi>Rome,</hi> reaching down
to the River ſide, which is kept off by a Terrace with Pilaſters, very
magnificent, and very commodious for walking. It being the
faireſt ſeaſon of the year, <hi>Emilia</hi> came<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>down thither everynight
to take the freſh-air, and <hi>Scipio,</hi> out of a certain piece of gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
very ordinary in <hi>Rome,</hi> taking a little boat, and driving
along the River to <hi>Scaurus</hi>'s Garden, had often ſeen <hi>Emilia</hi> upon
the Terrace, and, without quitting the boat, had had in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ſeveral converſations with her. And whereas the deſign he
had upon the Lady, was approved by his friends, no body took
any offence at, or cenſured his ſo doing; for ſince the houſe was
alwayes open to him, the converſation of the Garden was not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
him.</p>
                        <p>But meeting one evening with <hi>Antonius</hi> at <hi>Octavia</hi>'s, he invited
him to that divertiſement, and that he did the more freely, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
he did not conceal any thing from him of his amorous adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
The melancholy <hi>Antonius</hi> was content to accompany his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97242:12"/>
friend to that walk, and being gotten into the boat with him, they
went down the River towards <hi>Emilia</hi>'s Garden. <hi>Antonius,</hi> out of
a confidence not inferiour to that of <hi>Scipio</hi> towards him, had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
his mind to him, and had fully acquainted him with that
fatal adventure, whereby he came to fall in love with that Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Beauty, and which had changed his natural cheerfulneſſe
into ſo much cloudyneſſe and melancholy. <hi>Scipio</hi> had taken abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of pains to get him the acquaintance of that Excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
but his endeavours had proved as fruitleſſe as thoſe of other
people. Now this conſideration being the ordinary employment of
<hi>Antonius</hi>'s thoughts, it proved alſo the ſubject of his diſcourſe
with <hi>Scipio</hi> in the boat, and they talked of the conſequences of
that accident, till they came in ſight of the place where <hi>Emilia</hi>
was wont to walk. It being as fair and pleaſant an evening as
could be wiſhed, <hi>Emilia</hi> failed not to be walking upon the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race;
where <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Antonius</hi> had no ſooner diſcovered her,
but they could perceave another Lady walking with her. The
Waves of the Tiber did continually waſh the wall of the Terrace,
ſo that <hi>Scipio</hi> could cauſe the boat to be brought as near it as he
pleaſed, and the Terrace being of no great height, he could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with <hi>Emilia,</hi> and not ſpeak any louder then ordinary, and
diſcern all objects with eaſe, at a certain diſtance, which was not
very great. As they drew neer, <hi>Scipio,</hi> who knew not the Lady
that was with <hi>Emilia,</hi> would have asked <hi>Antonius</hi> whether he had
any acquaintance with her: and <hi>Antonius,</hi> whoſe thoughts were
otherwiſe taken up, and had not ſo much as looked towards her,
thought to have a fuller ſight of her when the boat was come ſo
neer as that he might eaſily diſcern her. But, at the ſame inſtant,
ſhe, not deſirous it ſeems to be known, lets fall her vail over her
face, and deprived them of the ſight of it; yet not ſo ſuddenly,
but that the prepoſſeſſed <hi>Antonius</hi> could perceave ſome few raies of
the ſame Beauty which he had ſo well engraven in his memory.
This confuſed and imperfect glimpſe put him into ſuch a diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,
that he was no further concerned in the firſt interview be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Emilia,</hi> then a ſubmiſſive ſalute to <hi>Emilia</hi> and
her Companion amounted to, on the latter whereof his eyes were
ſo much the more faſtened, out of that ſuſpition that raiſed no
ſmall tempeſt in his heart. At laſt he diſperſed that cloud which
he thought his mind over-ſpread with ſo unſeaſonably, and with
ſo little ground, and engaging himſelf in the converſation that was
between <hi>Emilia</hi> and her Friend, he confirmed her by his diſcourſe,
in the good opinion ſhe had conceaved of him. <hi>Emilia</hi>'s Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
ſeemed not at all concerned in their diſcourſe, though ſhe were
ſtill in place, and it being her deſign not to diſcover her ſelf, ſhe
accordingly was reſolved not to ſpeak at all. But <hi>Scipio</hi> having
a particular curioſity to be acquainted with his Miſtreſſes's Friends
of her own Sex, addreſſing his ſpeech to her: <hi>Since you are a Friend
of</hi> Emilia's, ſaid he to her, <hi>can you have ſo much cruelty as to conceal
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97242:12"/>
your ſelf any longer from thoſe perſons, who, of all the World, have
the greateſt honour that may be for whatever is dear to</hi> Emilia? The
Lady, who thought her ſelf obliged not to be altogether awanting
in point of civility towards a perſon of ſo much worth as <hi>Scipio,</hi>
eſpecially one ſhe knew to be much in the affections of her friend;
or rather out of an imagination, that the accent of her voice
would not be diſcovered by a perſon, with whom ſhe had not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed
above three or four words in her life, would needs put
her ſelf to the hazard of making him ſome anſwer. Seeing him
therefore in a great expectation of it; <hi>Though I am a friend of</hi>
Emilia's, ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>yet am I not any of thoſe you have ſeen
about her before, and, for my face, it is ſo little known in</hi> Rome, <hi>that
you would be never the more ſatisfyed, though you had your full ſight
of it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thoſe few words were all they could get from her, but there
needed no more to diſcover her to my Brother, and the accent of
that voice came ſo full into his memory, that at the firſt ſyllables
ſhe uttered, he knew her again as perfectly as if he had ſpent his
whole life with her, and to the knowledge of her voice, adding
the great trouble ſhe was in to conceal her ſelf, and the little
glimpſe he had had of her face when ſhe covered, he was abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſatisfied ſhe was the ſame perſon, that, in ſo few minutes, had
raiſed ſuch a combuſtion in his ſoul. Whence it came that he
was at ſuch a loſſe at the rencounter, that he continued in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
for ſome minutes, between aſtoniſhment and joy; but at
laſt, not able to maſter his firſt reſentments, which abſolutely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
him to the mercy of his paſſion, and crying out with an
action full of tranſportation; <hi>Ah Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>though,
you are unknown to</hi> Scipio, <hi>you are not to</hi> Antonius, <hi>and the fatal
aſſiſtance you once afforded him, hath left an impreſſion of you too
deeply graven in his heart ever to miſtake you; however you may be
pleaſed to conceal your ſelf from him. Tis you that a grateful incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and a ſoul over-flown with the tendreſt paſſion ſeeks every
where; and it is you alone for whoſe ſake I contemn all the</hi> Roman
<hi>Beauties, nay, whatever the earth affords beſides.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He had ſaid more, his paſſion it ſeems ſuggeſting ſuch words as
he could not forbear uttering, when that cruel Beauty deſirous to
avoid all further diſcourſe with him, whiſpered ſomething to
<hi>Emilia,</hi> and taking her by the arm, drew her along with her, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affording her the leaſure of a few words to excuſe her ſelf to
<hi>Antonius</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> ſo that ſhe was forced to leave them, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
her friend, who pretended to be indiſpoſed. If <hi>Antonius</hi>
was ſurprized at this unexpected meeting with his Unknown
Miſtreſſe, he was no leſſe at her haſty departure; and if the one
had raiſed a certain joy in him, the other cauſed in him an equal
affliction, as being not able, without an exceſſive grief, to imagine
that that very perſon, to whoſe ſervice he had devoted himſelf

eyes as long as he could, and being in the boat he held his arms
acroſſe, the ordinary poſture of a man in a confuſion; or, to ſay
better, at an abſolute loſſe. <hi>O ye gods,</hi> cryed he at laſt, after he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
ſome time in that condition, <hi>what fortune do you intend me,
and with what new kind of misfortune is Heaven reſolved to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
me!</hi> This he ſeconded with a many other exclamations,
which it were hard for me, and withall to no purpoſe, to repeat
to you: but at laſt having fixed on ſome reſolution, he turned to
his friend, who was in a manner as much aſtoniſhed at this adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as himſelf, and looking on him with an action abſolutely paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate;
<hi>Dear Friend,</hi> ſaid he to him, <hi>you are ſenſible of my preſent
condition, and, I doubt not, are much at a loſſe to ſee the ſtrangneſſe
of my fate. I, by an unexpected accident, light upon what I ſeek
I know not where, and what I love, though it be unknown to me, and
yet from this rencounter I derive no other knowledge then that of
my own inevitable misfortune, ſince I cannot but apprehend, to my
confuſion, that I am no leſſe hated then I am my ſelf amorous, and
that this cruel Vnknown Beauty abhors me ſo far, that to avoid me,
ſhe forgets all Courtſhip and ordinary civility: It muſt needs be,
that Nature hath put ſomething that is odious in my perſon, that
ſhould cauſe ſo ſudden and ſo ſtrange an antipathy between us,
ſince I am confident it cannot proceed from any of my
actions.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Hereupon he ſate ſtill for ſome minutes, while</hi> Scipio, <hi>no leſſe
ſurprized then he, could not find any thing to ſay to him upon
that adventure: ſo that reaſſuming the diſcourſe:</hi> If you have
any affection or reſpects for me, <hi>ſaid he to him,</hi> as I ought not to
queſtion but you have, you may do me a good office which I ſhould
gladly return you in ſuch an emergency. My cruell Vnknown
Miſtreſſe is now at <hi>Emilia's,</hi> ſhe may not haply ſtay there an hour;
and if I let ſlip this opportunity of knowing her, I ſhall not haply
recover it while I live again, it being not to be doubted but that,
when ſhe leaves <hi>Emilia,</hi> ſhe will oblige her to conceal from me what
ſhe would have me ignorant of. When <hi>Emilia</hi> left us to follow her,
ſhe forbad us not to come to her houſe, and conſequently without
any fear of diſpleaſing her, you may bring me to that part of the
houſe where ſhe lodges, where you have free admittance, and where
we ſhall find her yet, provided we afford her not the time to be gone:
ſo I ſhall ſee her through your means, I ſhall make acquaintance with
her if I can, and ſhall endeavour to learn the cauſe of this violent
averſion. As you reſpect the gods, Friend, deny me not this aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
which you may not haply have the opportunity to afford me
while you live again, in an exigency wherein my quiet is ſo much
concerned.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="21" facs="tcp:97242:13"/>
He would have added other intreaties, when <hi>Scipio,</hi> who had
abundance of affection for him, not ſuffering him to proceed:
<hi>There is no neceſſity,</hi> ſaid he to him, <hi>to uſe ſo much ſollicitation
to work out a quiet which is as dear to me as my own, let us go to</hi>
Emilia'<hi>s, ſince you deſire it; and let us hope, that, in caſe ſhe take
any diſpleaſure at this action, ſhe may pardon it out of a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of our friendſhip.</hi> Having taken this reſolution, they cauſed
the boat to put off, and being brought as neer as they could
come to the ſtreet, wherein was the great gate of <hi>Scaurus</hi>'s houſe,
they went about, and ſoon got thither. <hi>Scipio</hi> being much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
in the houſe, went ſtraight to that part where <hi>Emilia</hi>
had her lodgings, where thoſe of the houſe were wont to ſee
him almoſt every day; and, as fortune would have it, they were
no ſooner come into her Chamber, but they preſently perceaved
<hi>Emilia</hi> and her Companion; who, ſtanding neer a window, with
their backs turned to it, were fallen, as they inferred from their
geſture, into a very ſerious diſcourſe. <hi>Antonius</hi> immediately
knew the beloved countenance of the cruell one that ſo much
avoided him, and the freſh flames, which at that moment found
a paſſage quite into his heart, heightned the fatall fire that was
already kindled in his ſoul. He went towards her very amazed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
but ſhe immediately perceaving it, to avoid him, as one
would do, that they think moſt abominable, haſtily leaves <hi>Emilia,</hi>
and runs into a cloſet, that lay hard by whereof the door was
open. It happened, that either by accident, or by reaſon of
the fright ſhe was put into, ſhe forgot to ſhut it; ſo that <hi>Antonius,</hi>
whom the ſudden tranſport of his paſſion had deprived of part
of his diſcretion, and ſmothered the reſpect he ought <hi>Emila,</hi>
followed her into the cloſet, and ſeeing her ſate on a chair, runs
to her with ſuch precipitation, that he was at her feet, and held
her faſt by the knees, in a manner before ſhe had had the time
to perceave what he did. This beautiful enemy of <hi>Antonius,</hi>
being neither able to get away from him, nor yet to endure his
preſence, whoſe importunate purſuite very much enflamed her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,
ſpent ſome few minutes in conſidering what reſolution
ſhe ſhould take, diſcovering in her countenance the marks of an
extraordinary agitation. At laſt ſhe thought fit to ſpeak firſt, and
endeavouring to force my Brother from her knees, with an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which though it expreſſed her ſufficiently incenſed againſt
him, yet made her not ſeem the leſſe amiable. <hi>Vpon what account
is it,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>that thou dareſt thus violate the reſpect due
to my ſex and my birth, and by what action is it that I have deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be expoſed to thy unmerciful perſecution? Is it not enough
that thou haſt receaved from me an aſſiſtance which I was not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to afford my enemy? Or wilt thou in requital force me once
more to quit</hi> Rome <hi>to avoid what is to me, of all the earth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
moſt abominable?</hi> Theſe words pronounced with a ſhrill
voice, and after a manner abſolutely imperious, ſtruck <hi>Antonius</hi>
                           <pb n="22" facs="tcp:97242:14"/>
like a Thunder-clap, and put him for a while to ſuch a loſſe of
ſpirits, that he knew not what to ſay. At laſt, rallying all the
courage and reſolution he had about him to ſtand out this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter.
<hi>Adorable enemy,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>whom I do adore, though,
I do not know, and to whom I am odious, yet am to learn the reaſon
why, miſtake not for a perſecution, or any want of reſpect for your
Divine Beauties, thoſe effects that proceed from a cauſe abſolutely
contrary. No, theſe are the expreſſions of my gratitude, and a
paſſion full of veneration and reſpect, which I fatally conceaved for
you, at the very moment I became obliged to you for your aſſiſtance.
Then it was that I became yours, much out of a conſideration of the
aſſiſtance you afforded me, but infinitely more through the violent
impreſſion which your celeſtial beauties made of a ſudden in my
heart, which thereupon abſolutely yielded to be yours without the
leaſt reſiſtance. I have tenderly, nay indeed but too too tenderly for
my own quiet, preſerved the memory of the obligation you put upon
me, and the glorious wound I receaved; and therefore you ought
to be the leſſe offended, if I am at ſome pains to find out the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
both to acknowledge your goodneſſe, and to ſee again thoſe
fair eyes that had hurt me. If my eyes have done you any hurt,</hi>
replies the Unknown Beauty ſomewhat angrily, <hi>they have done me
ſuch an injury as I ſhall never be able to pardon them: and if what
you ſay be true, you will find your ſelf very unfortunate in your
addreſſe to a perſon, who cannot, otherwiſe then by hatred and aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
make any return to your affection. I am indeed eaſily perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi>
replies the amazed Antonius, <hi>that</hi> I <hi>deſerve this cruel averſion
by reaſon of ſome defects in my perſon, ſince</hi> I <hi>am confident</hi> I <hi>could
never have merited it by any action, or thought</hi> I <hi>have ever been
guilty of.</hi> I <hi>ſee then,</hi> replyed ſhe much diſpleaſed with him, <hi>that</hi>
I <hi>am ſtill unknown to you, and, were you not ignorant whom you ſpeak
to,</hi> I <hi>am confident you would not ſpeak to me at all. Certain it is,</hi>
ſaid he to her, <hi>with a very ſubmiſſive geſture, that</hi> I <hi>am to learn
whom</hi> I <hi>ſpeak to, and whom</hi> I <hi>have beſtowed my ſelf on, unleſſe there
be no more requiſite to know you, then to have well obſerved the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
qualities of your admirable perſon: all the endeavours</hi> I <hi>have
uſed to gain a more particular knowledge of you, have proved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual,
ſo that</hi> I <hi>am now at a loſſe what</hi> I <hi>ought to learn, or what</hi>
I <hi>ought to deſire, ſince the knowledge of your perſon is of no leſſe
concernment to me then that of your averſion. You ſhal know both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
replies the Unknown Beauty, <hi>and you will be no longer to ſeek
why</hi> I <hi>ſhun you, when</hi> I <hi>have told you that</hi> I <hi>am Daughter to</hi> Cicero,
<hi>and you remember, that you are Son to</hi> Anthony <hi>and</hi> Fulvia, <hi>his
Executioners.</hi> With theſe words ſhe goes out of the Cloſet into
<hi>Emilia</hi>'s Chamber, and out of that into another, where ſhe locked
up her ſelf for fear of further purſuit.</p>
                        <p>But indeed there was no neceſſity ſhe ſhould take all that pains,
for he, whoſe purſuit ſhe was ſo much afraid of, was at ſuch a loſſe,
and ſo ſurprized at the diſcovery ſhe had made to him of her
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97242:14"/>
ſelf, that he hardly knew where he was. Not that, from his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
that ſhe whom he loved was <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Daughter, he
felt any diminution in his love, nor yet that being his Daughter,
ſhe appeared leſſe amiable; but that all the hopes he might have
conceaved vaniſhed away in an inſtant. And when it came into
his mind, not onely that <hi>Anthony</hi> had cauſed <hi>Cicero</hi> to be put to
death, but alſo that <hi>Fulvia,</hi> his Mother, had cauſed his head and
his hands to be faſtened to the <hi>Roſtra,</hi> where he uſed to make his
Orations, and had committed a thouſand cruel indignities on the
reliques of that great perſon, whoſe memory was ſo precious
among the <hi>Romans,</hi> he had no more to ſay for himſelf, and could
not blame his Daughter for the horrour ſhe had conceaved againſt
the Son of <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Fulvia.</hi> For, though indeed divers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
had loſt their lives, during the proſcriptions of the <hi>Triumvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi>
which yet occaſioned not eternal enmities between families,
yet it is certain that in the death of <hi>Cicero,</hi> there had been ſome
circumſtances ſo cruel, and <hi>Fulvia,</hi> naturally inclined to bloud,
had uſed him with ſo much inhumanity, even after death, that my
Brother, whoſe memory was of a ſudden burthen'd with all thoſe
things, and whoſe inclinations were abſolutely vertuous, could
not think on them without horrour, <hi>Woe is me,</hi> cryed he at laſt,
riſing up from the place where he had continued all this while, and
turning to <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Emilia,</hi> who had been witneſſes of all that
was paſſed, <hi>the Daughter of</hi> Cicero, <hi>hath indeed reaſon to avoid the
Son of</hi> Fulvia; <hi>but the ſon of</hi> Fulvia <hi>hath not his own deſtiny at his
diſpoſal, and cannot forbear loving, whiles he lives, the Daughter of</hi>
Cicero.</p>
                        <p>With theſe words he, at the entreaty of <hi>Emilia,</hi> ſate down, and
lay under ſuch a dark cloud of affliction, that for a good while
he was not fit for any converſation. During that time, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
from <hi>Emilia,</hi> without any deſire of his to be informed, that
<hi>Tullia</hi> was a neer Kinſwoman of hers, and that her Mother <hi>Teren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>
was of the family of the <hi>Scauri,</hi> that the beauty and excellent
endowments of that young Ladie had made no great noiſe in
<hi>Rome,</hi> and that her perſon had not been known there ſo much as
in all probabilitie it ought to have been; by reaſon that while ſhe
was yet verie young, and that during the time the houſe lay under
diſgrace, her Mother had carryed her to a Country-houſe neer
<hi>Tuſculum,</hi> where ſhe had ſpent her life in ſolitude, without ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to <hi>Rome;</hi> and that haply ſhe had not come thither ſo ſoon,
if, upon occaſion of her Mothers death, which happened not long
before, her Brother <hi>Quintus Cicero,</hi> who lived at <hi>Rome</hi> after a
verie noble and high rate, and had been nominated <hi>Proconſul</hi> in
ſome part of <hi>Africk,</hi> had not ſome few daies ſince ſent for her.
<hi>Emilia</hi> further acquainted <hi>Antonius</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> that <hi>Tullia,</hi> beſides
the perfections of her body, had a many admirable endowments,
that ſhe had cultivated an excellent diſpoſition with an excellent
education, and that, during the time of her ſolitude, being addicted
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97242:15"/>
to the ſtudy of the nobler kind of Sciences, ſhe was grown per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
therein; that ſhe diſcovered abundance of courage and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
that ſhe was not ſubject to the weakneſſe of our Sex; and
that ſhe was of a converſation infinitely pleaſant, when ſhe was
among perſons to whom ſhe was pleaſed to communicate
her ſelf.</p>
                        <p>To theſe <hi>Emilia</hi> added a many other things in commendation
of <hi>Tullia,</hi> whereof the effect was, that they made the wound of
the unfortunate <hi>Antonius</hi> wider than it was, and diſarmed him of
all the forces he had to oppoſe a paſſion, wherein he expected
not to find any ſatisfaction. <hi>Scipio</hi> was extreamly troubled at it,
through thoſe ſentiments which friendſhip inſpired him with;
and <hi>Emilia,</hi> who had that eſteem for his vertue, as all others had
that were acquainted with it, had an extraordinary compaſſion
for his misfortune, and would have been very glad to find out any
means to comfort and aſſiſt him. But knowing <hi>Tullia</hi> to be a
perſon conſtant and unchangeable in her reſolution, eſpecially in
thoſe, wherein ſhe thought her honour concerned, and that from
what ſhe already knew, ſhe foreſaw that the paſſionate <hi>Antonius</hi>
would find but little ſatisfaction in his love, ſhe endeavoured to
divert his thoughts from it, with the beſt arguments ſhe could
make againſt it, and forbore not to tell him whatever ſhe imagined
might put him into ſome doubt of the ſucceſſe, and fear of her
friends humour. My Brother heard her with abundance of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and great expreſſion of the reſentment he had of her good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in concerning her ſelf ſo much in his misfortune: but when
all was done, he proteſted to her, that it was impoſſible for him to
make any advantage of her good adviſe, and that that unfortunate
paſſion was grown ſo predominant in his ſoule, that he was out of
all hopes ever to ſee himſelf free from it, what courſe ſoever he
might take. <hi>Scipio</hi> added his remonſtrances to thoſe of <hi>Emilia,</hi>
and knowing, that, beſides the difficulties, which his friend might
well fear in reſpect of <hi>Tullia,</hi> he was in the ready way, by a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
love, to ruine his fortunes which ſeemed abſolutely to court
him in the deſign which <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had to marry him to one of his
Neeces, he repreſented to him whatever his friendſhip could ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
that were moſt rational, and moſt likely to prevail with him
in that emergency: but he took pains to as litle purpoſe as
<hi>Emilia,</hi> and that poor lover, too too violently prepoſſeſſed, made
them both ſuch anſwers, as raiſed in them more compaſſion to ſee
him ſo reſolute, then hope to ſee him of any other mind. <hi>I am
not to learn,</hi> ſaid he to them at laſt, <hi>that in</hi> Tullia'<hi>s averſion</hi> I <hi>have
a terrible enemy to engage with, nay am further ſatisfied that the
hatred ſhe hath for our Family is ſo juſtifiable, that I ſhould find it
a hard matter to find any pretence to condemn her for it. As to the
deſign which</hi> Caeſar <hi>and</hi> Octavia <hi>have upon me, I know it amounts
to thoſe advantages, to which, the poſture of my Fortune conſidered,</hi>
I <hi>could not raiſe my hopes: nor am</hi> I <hi>ignorant, that by my
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97242:15"/>
importunate addreſſes to a perſon that ſhuns me, and will haply ſhun
me while ſhe lives, I run the hazard of turning the Emperours</hi>'s <hi>good
inclinations towards me into juſt reſentments againſt me. But there is
ſomething withal I know much better than I do all this, that is, that
I am not able to hear any reaſon in the wretched condition to which
I am reduced; and that whatever the moſt enforcing arguments
might produce where there is freedom of ſpirit, will have no effect
at all upon a mind fatally and unfortunately prepoſſeſſed. I am ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
perſwaded,</hi> added he a while after, <hi>that this misfortune is
an effect of the wrath of the gods againſt the memory of</hi> Anthony
and <hi>Fulvia, and that they could not revenge that of the unfortunate</hi>
Cicero, <hi>againſt his murtherers, otherwiſe then by ſacrificing their
Son to the Daughter of him whom they ſacrificed to their rage and
ambition.</hi> O Anthony, O Fulvia! concluded he with a ſigh, <hi>I
refuſe not to be the victime that muſt appeaſe the incenſed Deities;
and I cheerfully offer my ſelf up to the fair</hi> Tullia, <hi>to expiate the
bloud you have unjuſtly ſpilt.</hi> Theſe were all the words <hi>Emilia</hi>
and <hi>Scipio</hi> could get of him; and a while after, out of a fear to
diſpleaſe <hi>Emilia,</hi> by depriving her of the converſation of her
friend, he took his leave of her in ſo ſad a manner, that it raiſed
in her an extraordinary compaſſion for him, and went out of the
houſe with <hi>Scipio,</hi> who would not by any means leave him; but
it was in ſuch a poſture, and with a countenance ſo diſturbed, that
it was no eaſie matter to know him.</p>
                        <p>From that day he grew more and more melancholy and affected
ſolitude much more then he had done; and if, while he knew not
who was the object of his paſſion, the deſire to be acquainted
with it, was his perpetuall torment, the knowledge he had of it
troubled him alſo after a ſtrange manner; and the leſſe diſturbed
and moved he was at it, the more he ſeemed to be afflicted and
caſt down. He was ſeldom ſeen at the Emperours, at <hi>Octavias,</hi>
or at the Princeſſe <hi>Julias,</hi> or in any of the nobleſt companies of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and if any of his friends came to him, where he ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
them with abundance of civility, they found him ſo
changed and different from what he was wont to be, that they
had not the patience to ſee him in that condition, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
themſelves in his affliction, though they knew not the
cauſe of it. All his thoughts, all his deſignes, aimed at nothing
ſo much as to find out an opportunity to ſpeak once more to
<hi>Tullia,</hi> out of an imagination, that, if he could but eaſt himſelf at
her feet, and entertain her with the diſcourſe which his mind per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
ran upon, though her ſoul were made of iron, he ſhould
ſoften it. In this imagination he made a hundred paſſionate
ſpeeches, and his love inſpired him with the tendreſt things any
mind could be capable of: but when he had ſufficiently rumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on what he would have ſaid to her; he ſtill was to ſeek for the
opportunity to ſpeak with her.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="26" facs="tcp:97242:16"/>
                           <hi>Tullia</hi> had been in <hi>Rome</hi> but ſome few dayes, and her abode
was at her Brother's, <hi>Quint us Cicero,</hi> who lived after the rate of a
Conſular houſe, ſuitably to the condition his Father had left him
in; but there was no likelihood <hi>Antonius</hi> ſhould ever give her a
viſit at that houſe. The Son of <hi>Cicero</hi> had for the family of
<hi>Anthony</hi> a reſentment which none could blame him for; and
though, by reaſon of <hi>Caefars</hi> authority, the factions of the <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virate</hi>
had been reconciled, and that the families among which
the difference of parties had produced very fatall effects, were
content to be quiet, and forbore openly to endeavour the revenge
of paſt injuries, yet had not that reconciliation, which had put a
Period to the civil wars, ſo far reunited their hearts, as to eſtabliſh
friendſhip, and ſecure the freedom of viſits: nay, though this
had been effected among thoſe whoſe enmities were grounded
on more inconſiderable injuries, yet thoſe between the children of
<hi>Cicero</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Fulvia,</hi> amounted to ſome thing
more bloody, then to admit of any correſpondence between them:
Beſides, young <hi>Cicero</hi> was a perſon of a nature much different from
that of his Father, he was ſtupid, bruitiſh and malicious, and
though he ſmothered his reſentments out of a fear to diſcover
them againſt a houſe of a far greater fortune than his own; yet
is it certain, that, if he could<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have done us a miſchief without
any hazard to himſelf, he would have embraced the opportunity
to do it, and therefore it was impoſſible <hi>Antonius</hi> ſhould attempt
the ſeeing of <hi>Tullia</hi> at her Brothers houſe, without putting his
life into manifeſt danger. Yet was it not this fear that hindred
him, for that of diſpleaſing <hi>Tullia</hi> had a far greater influence upon
his ſpirit, then that of hazarding a life that could not be of much
value to him, conſidered with the misfortune that attended it:
Nay, he would have cheerfully ventured into that houſe, though
his enemie's, without any reflection on the danger that might
enſue, had he obſerved in <hi>Tullia</hi> any ſentiments different from
thoſe of her Brother: but it was his unhappineſſe, that after he
had ſubdued the enemies he contemned, he ſhould meet with one
that was terrible, againſt whom yet he had no arms to defend
himſelf. A hundred times did he caſt himſelf at <hi>Emilia</hi>'s feet,
and made uſe of the intereſt <hi>Scipio</hi> had in her, to obtain of <hi>Tullia</hi>
the permiſſion to ſee her but once more in his life: in anſwer to
which <hi>Em<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>lia,</hi> who had a great eſteem for <hi>Antonius,</hi> as alſo upon
the interceſſion of his friend, did all that lay in her power to
perſwade her Kinſwoman to afford him that ſatisfaction. But
<hi>Tullia</hi> was not onely inexorable as to that requeſt, but fearing
further that in her viſits to <hi>Emilia,</hi> ſhe might meet with <hi>Antonius</hi>
at her houſe either by accident, or out of deſign, ſhe entreated her
not to take it amiſſe if ſhe came not to her any more, till ſhe were
confident that <hi>Antonius</hi> had quitted all inclinations for her;
inſomuch that having earneſtly intreated her pardon for that reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
ſhe perſiſted in it ſo far, that ſhe made no more viſits to her,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97242:16"/>
or, if ſhe ſaw her ſometimes, it was at ſuch hours that ſhe was in no
fear of finding my Brother there.</p>
                        <p>This cruel obſtinacy of hers to avoid <hi>Antonius</hi> had almoſt put
him into deſpair, and yet ſuch was his unhappineſſe, that what
would have recovered any other out of an affection ſo much
ſlighted, made his cure the more deſperate. All the diſcoveries
of <hi>Tullia</hi>'s cruelty ſignified, in his apprehenſion, ſo many expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of her vertue, and the reſpect ſhe had for the memory of her
Father; and ſo bewayling his own misfortune, he thought he
could not juſtly charge her with any thing. He conſtantly viſited
all the places ſhe was wont to frequent: but ſhe, being as carefull
to avoid him, as he was diligent to find her out, forbore going
thither as ſoon as ſhe perceaved that he had diſcovered ſo much:
yet could not all her caution hinder, but that he ſaw her ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in the Temple, but ſhe either let fall her veyle as ſoon as ſhe
perceaved him, or took up ſuch places, and kept ſtill ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
that he could not come to her. But one day above the reſt,
ſhe having not been ſo careful as at other times, and being gone to
the Temple of <hi>Ceres,</hi> with the Maids that ordinarily waited on her,
while ſhe was at her devotion, in a remote corner, and at ſuch a
time as there were hardly any people in the Temple, my Brother,
who had cauſed her to be watched where ever ſhe went, having
had notice of the place where ſhe was, failed not to come thither,
and to ſpeak to her, but with a countenance that ſufficiently diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the fear he was in to diſpleaſe her. <hi>Tullia</hi> had no ſooner
perceaved him coming towards her, but ſhe lets fall her veyle, and
by that action had almoſt put the ſad <hi>Antonius</hi> ſo far out of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
that he hardly had the courage to ſpeak to her. However,
he made a ſhift to recover himſelf, and when he was got neer her,
making a halt as if he ſtayed for ſome body, and having looked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the door of the Temple, he at laſt turned his face to <hi>Tullia,</hi>
whom, though ſhe looked another way, addreſſing his ſpeech to
her; <hi>Is it poſſible, Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>you ſhould hope for any
favour from the gods you adore, when you your ſelf are inexorable
towards thoſe men that adore you? Tullia</hi> was ſilent a while out of
a reſolution not to make <hi>Antonius</hi> any anſwer at all; but at laſt
conceaving that what ſhe ſhould make him would be ſuch, as ſhe
might haply be rid of him for ever after: <hi>It is not for the Son of</hi>
Fulvia, ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>to hope for any favour from the Daughter of</hi>
Cicero; <hi>and if</hi> Cicero'<hi>s Daughter may expect any from</hi> Anthony'<hi>s
Son, it ſhall be no other then that he would never either ſee or think on
her again. You cannot without injuſtice,</hi> replies Antonius, <hi>charge me
with the crime of</hi> Mark-Anthony <hi>and</hi> Fulvia; <hi>nay I am confident
you are ſatisfied of my innocence; I am ſo,</hi> replyed ſhe, <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I have not the leaſt thought of revenge for you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> but, if I am
not miſtaken, I can be charged with no injuſtice, if I abjure all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
with their ſon, who were the implacable murtherers of my
Father. Ah unmerciful woman!</hi> replyed the afflicted Prince, <hi>you
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97242:17"/>
pretend reaſon not to be revenged of a perſon that is innocent, and
in the mean time know very well, that, if you ſhould thruſt a dagger
into my breaſt, there were much leſſe cruelty in your revenge, then
there is in your ſhunning me as you do. I ſhall ſhun you while I live,</hi>
replyed ſhe very angrily, <hi>and, if you get not from me, I ſhall not
onely quit this Temple, but ſhall leave</hi> Rome <hi>and</hi> Italy, <hi>in caſe you do
not forbear perſecuting me.</hi> With theſe words ſhe would have
riſen out of the place where ſhe was, but <hi>Antonius,</hi> thinking he
could not any further preſſe her without incivility, prevented her
departure; and having made her a low reverence, he went from
her, ſo clouded with affliction, that for that whole day he was not
capable of any converſation.</p>
                        <p>Though <hi>Antonius</hi> found it a great difficulty to conceal from
thoſe who were acquainted with his natural cheerfulneſſe, the
change which that unfortunate paſſion had wrought in him, yet
were they ignorant of the cauſe, and for a good ſpace of time
onely <hi>Scipio</hi> knew the myſtery of it. But, at laſt, it came to the
knowledge of diverſe perſons by ſeverall diſcoveries ſufficiently
extraordinary, but particularly by one which, becauſe it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and withall very rare, made no ſmall noiſe in <hi>Rome.</hi> The
Emperour, <hi>Livia, Julia, Octavia,</hi> and all the Illuſtrious Perſons
about <hi>Rome</hi> were one day aſſembled in the Cirque, where they
were to be entertained with the combats of ſavage beaſts, by
<hi>Agrippa,</hi> who had brought them out of <hi>Africk</hi> to that purpoſe, as
you know it is an ordinary thing at <hi>Rome,</hi> as alſo that thoſe who
would have the reputation of being magnificent, do often enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the people with ſuch ſports. Though <hi>Tullia</hi> went very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
into great companies, as well by reaſon of the mourning ſhe
was ſtill in for her Mother, as out of a fear of meeting <hi>Antonius,</hi>
yet this day ſhe thought her ſelf obliged to go, not onely upon the
account of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who was at the charge of the divertiſement,
but alſo becauſe it was her Brothers will ſhe ſhould go, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
he brought her thither with divers other Perſons of their
Family and Alliance. <hi>Antonius,</hi> who was very much in hope ſhe
would be there, and expected, with much impatience, to ſee her,
obſerved, very much to his ſatisfaction, the place where ſhe ſate,
which was near enough to her Brother, and ſome of her Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women:
but found withall to his grief, that <hi>Lucius Cecinna,</hi> a
young man, of an Illuſtrious Houſe, and one that had the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of courting her, having waited upon her thither, ſate down
by her. This ſight made <hi>Antonius</hi> bluſh, and enflamed him with
indignation and jealouſie; yet durſt he not ſeat himſelf near <hi>Tullia,</hi>
out of a fear ſhe would take it unkindly, and a confidence that ſhe
would admit no converſation with him; but he got into a place,
which, being not very far from her, and at one of the Angles of
the Amphitheatre, joyning to that where ſhe was, gave him the
advantage of ſeeing her better than any other part where he
could have placed himſelf. The ſeats of perſons of quality are
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97242:17"/>
in the loweſt Stage, and neereſt the <hi>Area,</hi> which is the place where
the combats are fought, whether they be between <hi>Beaſts</hi> or
<hi>Gladiators:</hi> ſo that thoſe of that rank may lean againſt certain
Pilaſters, whereby the Cirque is compaſſed about, and which is
raiſed up to ſuch a height, as to ſecure them from the fury of the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Tygers, that are the creatures of greateſt agility: the ſeats
behind that, being raiſed, and ſtanding at a greater diſtance, are
for the people, who are ordinarily admitted to theſe ſights, to
their very great delight and entertainment. I went thither my
ſelf that day with the Princeſſe <hi>Julia,</hi> though we were both of us
at that time but in the thirteenth year of our age, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
I can give you a more particular account of this action,
then of ſome others at which I was not preſent.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Antonius</hi> had his eyes continually faſtened on <hi>Tullia's</hi> face, who
never was guilty of ſo much as one look towards him. This amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Prince looked upon that freedom of converſation which was
between her and <hi>Cecinua,</hi> with a very jealous eye, and with no
ſmall diſturbance of mind: and if any one had concerned himſelf
ſo far as to mind his actions, he might eaſily have obſerved in his
countenance the agitations of his ſoul. There had paſt diverſe
combats of ſeveral beaſts, which found the Spectators abundance
of ſport and entertainment, and they were going to open the door
to let in a Tygre and a Bear of a prodigious bulk, to ſet them a
fighting together, when <hi>Antonius,</hi> who had his eyes ſtill fixed on
<hi>Tullia,</hi> ſaw, that amidſt the converſation ſhe had with <hi>Cecinna,</hi> and
certain Ladies that ſate about her, ſhe took out a little box, ſet
with divers rich Diamonds, wherein was her own picture, which
her Mother had cauſed to be taken about a year before, and which
ſhe had given her at her death. She had ſhewn it to thoſe Ladies,
and <hi>Cecinna</hi> had it in his hands a good ſpace: but at laſt going to
reſtore it to <hi>Tullia,</hi> the box, through negligence, ſlipt out of his
hands, and ſhe leaning on the raile, it fell down into the <hi>Area,</hi> juſt
when the two furious beaſts were coming into it with looks ſo full
of terrour, that they put the Spectators into ſome fear. <hi>Tullia,</hi> being
extreamly troubled at the fall of the box, ſhe reſpected ſo much,
into a place, whence in all likelihood there would not be any ſo
deſperate as to fetch it again, gave a great outcry, and by her
countenance and all her actions expreſſed an extraordinary diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
at that accident. The Emperour, and all that were preſent,
ſoon came to underſtand it, but there was no poſſibility to recover
it while the beaſts were within the Cirque. <hi>Cecinna,</hi> who was
partly the occaſion of the falling of the box, endeavoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
<hi>Tullia</hi> to patience, by telling her, that, after the combat of
the beaſts, he would go and find it for her: but ſhe giving too
much way to her indignation upon ſo ſlight an occaſion, anſwered
him very roundly, that had ſhe been a man, ſhe would have ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
her life to fetch her picture. She had no ſooner delivered
theſe words, but young <hi>Antonius,</hi> whom his paſſion had at that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97242:18"/>
time abſolutely deveſted of all reaſon, diſtracted as to all matter
of conſideration, not onely of the hazard whereto he expoſed
himſelf without any neceſſity, but alſo of the noiſe which that
action muſt needs make, contrary to the deſign he had to keep
his love ſecret, turning towards that ſide where <hi>Tullia</hi> was; <hi>Fair</hi>
Tullia, ſaid he, loud enough to be heard by her, <hi>you ſhall find
there is a man who dares hazard his life to do you this inconſider able
ſervice;</hi> and thereupon, leaning upon the raile, he vaulted over
it into the Cirque. I was ever of opinion, that <hi>Antonius,</hi> a perſon
naturally diſcreet, would never have been guilty of an action ſo
extravagant, had he not been tranſported by an over-violent
paſſion. But I imagined withall, as diverſe others did, that to do
<hi>Tullia</hi> that ſervice, whereof the conſequence deſerved not he
ſhould expoſe his life to ſo great a danger, he had been encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
partly by a belief he was of, that he might not haply, while
he lived, meet with ſo noble an occaſion to expreſſe his love to
her, and partly by a deſire he had to let her know the difference
there was between him and <hi>Cecinna,</hi> whom ſhe preferred, and
favoured even in his preſence. However it were, this action
raiſed a many outcryes among the Spectators, even to the Emperour
himſelf, who had a great love and eſteem to my Brother. My Siſter
and I were almoſt out of our ſelves to ſee it, <hi>Octavia</hi> was not a
little troubled at the accident, nay there was hardly any one in
that great Aſſembly, that was not troubled at it, onely <hi>Antonius</hi>
ſeemed to be the perſon that had any confidence, and though he
were a little ſtartled at his alighting, by reaſon of the height of
the place whence he had leapt down, yet immediately recovering
himſelf, he drew his ſword, and went with an undaunted courage
towards that ſide where the box lay ſparkling among the ſand.
He was ſo happy as to take it up without any hindrance, and ſo
indiſcreet as to open it in the ſame place, and to have the patience
to look on the beautiful picture of <hi>Tullia</hi> that was encloſed within
it. Yet was it not with ſo little caution, but he ſtood ſufficiently
on his guard, to defend himſelf if the beaſts came to faſten on
him: but as he went towards the door at which he was to go out,
he made no more haſt than ordinary, and retreated ſo as if he had
not been in the leaſt fear of the two beaſts that were within the
Cirque. The Bear ſtirred not from the place ſhe was in, but the
Tigre came up to my Brother with his ſparkling eyes, and in ſuch
a poſture, as put all that were preſent into a fright. <hi>Antonius</hi>
might have gained the door before the Tygre could have faſtened
on him, if he would have run for it, but ſuch a flight he thought
unworthy his courage; and therefore ſeeing this terrible enemy
coming towards him, he ſtood and expected him, and preſented
the point of his ſword to him with an admirable conſtancy. You
may well imagine, that all thoſe to whom <hi>Antonius</hi>'s life was any
way dear, were not a little troubled at the accident, but it was the
pleaſure of the gods, that when the furious beaſt ſaw the gliſtering
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97242:18"/>
of the ſword, it made a halt, and ſeemed uncertain what reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to take: when the Emperour having called out to thoſe of
his guard that were about him, immediately to kill it, it was ſhot
with above twenty arrows, and fell down dead at <hi>Antonius</hi>'s feet.
He ſeemed to be ſomewhat troubled at the death of the beaſt,
ſaying he was very ſorry he had deprived the Emperour and the
Spectators of part of their entertainment, and when he thought
he might retire without diſhonour, (for the Bear had not ſtirred
from the place) he came to the door which they kept open for
him, and by the ſtairs joyning thereto, came up into the Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatre.
As all that were preſent had a ſecret admiration for what
he had done, ſo did all gladly make way for him, it being percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that it was his intention to reſtore <hi>Tullia</hi> her picture; and
accordingly having without much trouble gotten up to the place
where ſhe was, he comes to her with a ſubmiſſive action, and
preſenting her with the box: <hi>Were I not odious in your ſight,
Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>I would entreat you to entertain the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
ſervice I have done you without averſion: and if I am ſo
unhappy as that I cannot be otherwiſe, I beſeech your acceptance and
acknowledgement of that I would have done you by expoſing my life
which you ſo much deteſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now the enmity which is between the Children of <hi>Cicero,</hi> and
the Houſe of <hi>Anthony,</hi> being known to all the World, no body
took any exceptions at thoſe words of <hi>Antonius;</hi> but there were
many who thought that that action ſhould have obliged <hi>Tullia</hi> to
ſome kindneſſe, or at leaſt to receave that ſervice with a ſeeming
civility. But her deportment was quite otherwiſe, and inſtead
of making any acknowledgement of the ſervice he had done her,
ſhe turned her face another way, and vouchſafed not ſo much as
either to make him any anſwer, or receave out of his hands the
picture he preſented to her. This action, which diſpleaſed all
that were preſent, ſtruck <hi>Antonius</hi> to the very heart; but having
fortified himſelf with an extraordinary courage, and done an
action ſo full of gallantry, that he thought himſelf obliged to
preſſe it home: <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her, not without ſome violence
done himſelf, to ſmother his grief in ſo great an Aſſembly, <hi>I muſt
confeſſe my unhappineſſe ſuch, that I deſerve to be treated as I am,
but do not haply, the precious treaſure you are pleaſed to leave me,
as ſuch as I durſt not have detained, had you thought good to
receave it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe words <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>cartled young <hi>Cicero</hi> a little, who ſate neer his
Siſter, and was as much diſpleaſed at my Brother's action as ſhe,
but withal would have been much troubled to ſee him keep his
Siſter picture. But he whom they had greateſt influence on, was
the amorous <hi>Cecinna,</hi> who being paſſionately in love with <hi>Tullia,</hi>
could not, without much diſturbance within himſelf, ſee her picture
in the hands of a man, whom he looked on as his Rival, and withal
a powerful one: ſo that he would undertake to <hi>Antonius,</hi> to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97242:19"/>
perſwade <hi>Tullia</hi> to receave the picture, and while he deſired it,
<hi>Cicero</hi> reached forth his hand to receave it from him. But <hi>Antonius</hi>
looking on them both with a certain contempt, and with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfull
ſmile; <hi>Tis not thee,</hi> Cicero, ſaid he to them, <hi>and much
leſſe to thee,</hi> Cecinna, <hi>that I intend to reſtore it; And ſince</hi> Tullia
<hi>is content it ſhould remain in my hands, I ſhall keep it no otherwiſe
then I would do my life. If thou wouldſt have had it, added he,
looking on</hi> Cecinna, <hi>thou ſhouldſt have gone for it to the place where
it fell through thy negligence; and if thou art ſo deſirous of it,
thou muſt force it out of a place, whence there will haply be as much
difficulty to get it, as from among Bears and Tygres. However it
be, I hear proteſt before the gods, that I ſhall never part with it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
till</hi> Tullia <hi>deſire it of me her ſelf, and that I will never put
it into other hands then hers.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>With theſe words he left <hi>Tullia,</hi> and, without any more adoe,
immediately quitted the Amphitheatre, out of a fear that <hi>Tullia</hi>
might change her mind, and call for her picture. She was upon
the point to do it, as being deſirous it ſhould not remain in his
hands, nay indeed would not have been well ſatisfied to leave it
with any man, how great an affection ſoever ſhe might have for
him: but thinking there were other wayes to retrive it, ſhe
thought it better to have patience for ſome dayes, then to remit
any thing of her diſdain, and ſtoop ſo low as to deſire it, after
what, had paſſed before ſo many great and Illuſtrious
Perſons.</p>
                        <p>This action raiſed no ſmall noiſe in <hi>Rome,</hi> and found all people
matter of diſcourſe. Several judgements paſſed upon it, there
were a many that attributed it to the true cauſe, others made it
onely a piece of gallantry, and the effect of a violent deſire of
glory, a thing not inconſiſtent with the fiery humour of a young
man: Nay, ſome pitching upon an opinion probable enough
according to the intention of <hi>Antonius,</hi> and the diſcourſe he made
of it, which was, that, having diſcovered <hi>Tullia</hi> in that great
Aſſembly to be the Lady from whom he had receaved ſuch
aſſiſtance when his horſe fell under him, whom till then he had
not known, and had ſought out ſo much, though he knew not
who ſhe was, imagined that he had reſolved to expreſſe by ſome
ſervice, the reſentment he ſtill had for the kindneſſe ſhe had done
him, and that juſt then an opportunity offering it ſelf, he thought
he could not, without baſeneſle, that is, without being accounted
either an ungrateful perſon, or a man of little courage, let it ſlip.
With this diſcourſe did my Brother ſatisfie the Emperour, who
blamed him very much for expoſing his life to ſo great a danger
without any neceſſity; but that account of the buſineſſe being
probable enough, <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> who could not diſapprove thoſe
actions that argued courage, had a greater eſteem for <hi>Antonius</hi>
then he had before. <hi>Octavia,</hi> who was as tender of all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Anthony,</hi> as ſhe was of her own, eſpecially of him ſhe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97242:19"/>
intended to make her Son in Law, entertained this diſcourſe as
the Emperour did, and attributed to gratitude, excellency of
nature, and the courage of <hi>Antonius:</hi> what was meerly a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of his paſſion. And yet what had paſt at the cloſure of
the buſineſſe, concerning <hi>Tullia</hi>'s picture, which he had refuſed to
reſtore either to <hi>Cicero,</hi> or <hi>Cecinna,</hi> with words paſſionate enough,
might cauſe a little ſuſpicion; but it might alſo be attributed to
pure gallantry, which might produce that effect in a perſon
of the age my Brother was then of, and that, after the doing of
ſo noble an action. In fine, every one cenſured it according to
his inclination; and <hi>Antonius,</hi> whatever might be ſaid to him,
could not repent him of it, though he was extreamly troubled at
<hi>Tullia</hi>'s deportment towards him, and that the vexation he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved
thereat, put him ſometimes into a reſolution, to do
what lay in his power, to free himſelfe of that cruell ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
                        <p>Some dayes after, having intreated <hi>Scipio</hi> to bring my Brother
with him to her houſe, he failed not to come; and having told
her that he ſhould think himſelf extreamly happy, if ſhe would be
pleaſed to lay any commands upon him, ſhe told him before
<hi>Scipio,</hi> who was preſent, that ſhe was deſirous to have ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with him upon the entreaty of <hi>Tullia,</hi> who had charged
her to demand her picture of him, and had deſired her to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
all the intereſt ſhe had in him to get it, upon the confidence
ſhe had that my Brother would not deny that ſatisfaction to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
for whom he ſeemed &amp; profeſſed to have a very great eſteem.
<hi>Antonius</hi> entertained this diſcourſe of <hi>Emilia's</hi> with abundance
of reſpect, and when ſhe had given over ſpeaking, <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid
he to her, <hi>it is not without reaſon your friend is perſwaded that you
have an abſolute power over me, and accordingly I did not much
doubt but that ſhe would make this requeſt to you, when ever ſhe ſhould
be content to have her picture again: and I further engage my ſelf,
that I will returne it as ſoon as ſhe ſhall be pleaſed to receave it, and
that I have no intention to keep it againſt her will, though I haply
better deſerve that favour than others, whom ſhe may confer it upon.</hi>
Tullia <hi>is more diſcreet, replies</hi> Emilia, <hi>then to beſtow her picture on
any one: and</hi> I <hi>can aſſure you ſhe hath no ſuch intention, and that
it is onely for her ſelf that ſhe hath entreated me to get it ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> of
your hands. Ah Madam!</hi> replied my Brother, <hi>you know what
I am obliged to by my oath, an oath</hi> I <hi>took in the moſt Illuſtrious
Aſſembly in the World.</hi> I <hi>cannot return the picture till</hi> Tullia
<hi>deſire it, nor put it into any other hands than her own.</hi> I <hi>conceave
my ſelf diſengaged as to the one half of it, and</hi> I <hi>receave the demand
you make of it, as from</hi> Tullia's <hi>own mouth: but for the other part
of my oath, whereby</hi> I <hi>am obliged to reſtore it onely to her self, it
cannot admit any explication. And if you will give me leave to
adde to the juſtice of my cauſe the confidence</hi> I <hi>have in your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and to ſpeak ſincerely to you, as to a perſon whoſe protection</hi> I
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97242:20"/>
                           <hi>caſt my ſelf under,</hi> I <hi>ſhall tell you, that for the favour of one viſit
from</hi> Tullia, <hi>ſhe ſhall receave her picture. Tis the leaſt ſhe can do,
if ſhe have any deſire to have it again: and if ſhe deny me ſo poor
a requeſt, you are to imagine it is her pleaſure</hi> I <hi>ſhould keep it: all</hi> I
<hi>deſire is to put it into her own hands in your preſence, and you ſhall
be privy to our converſation. And, to acquaint you with what is
moſt ſecret to my thoughts, ſince you ſee</hi> I <hi>have but this onely means
left me to procure one viſit more of</hi> Tullia <hi>while</hi> I <hi>live, methinks you
cannot without cruelty take it away from me. Emilia</hi> found a great
deal of reaſon in my Brothers diſcourſe, and <hi>Scipio</hi> adding his
perſwaſions to the others to prevaile with her, they brought her to
this at laſt, that ſhe promiſed to uſe all the intereſt ſhe could
with <hi>Tullia</hi> to oblige her to ſee <hi>Antonius</hi> once more, and to receave
her picture from his own hands, according as he was engaged by
his oath.</p>
                        <p>She made it her buſineſſe that very day, but to no purpoſe, ſo
that <hi>Antonius</hi> underſtood by her, the next, that all the entreaties
ſhe could make to her, could not induce that heard-hearted Beauty
to condeſcend thereto, and that, at laſt, ſhe had with a ſtrange
conſtancy proteſted, that ſhe had rather loſe her picture, by an
accident whence it might not be inferred that ſhe had any deſign
to favour <hi>Antonius,</hi> then reſolve to ſee him, and to ſpeak, with her
will, to a man, whoſe name thoſe of her family could not hear
without horrour. My Brother was extreamly caſt down at this
obſtinacy of <hi>Tullia,</hi> and entertained <hi>Emilia</hi> with diverſe diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
which moved her to much compaſſion for him: but he alſo
continued firm to the reſolution he had made not to deliver the
picture, not that he could do <hi>Tullia</hi> this diſpleaſure without ſome
repugnance, but that, beſides the comfort he receaved from the
ſight of that dear image, he thought he could not with honour
reſtore it, after the proteſtation he had made not to do it before
<hi>Cecinna</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> who pretended to be ſo much concerned in it.
What confirmed him further in this reſolution, was, that, ſome
dayes after, he underſtood that <hi>Cicero,</hi> purpoſely to ſpight him,
had beſtowed his Siſter on <hi>Cecinna;</hi> and it was conceaved that
within a few dayes he was to marry her, and indeed it was certain
that he had promiſed her to him, and though <hi>Tullia</hi> had not till

vertuous, ſhe ſubmitted to her Brother's will, and without any
contradiction entertained the Huſband he was pleaſed ſhe ſhould
have. This news put my Brother into ſuch violent tranſports of
grief, as you may eaſily imagine, if you conſider well what I have
told you concerning thoſe of his Love; nay, it is almoſt a miracle
that he did not diſcover it by ſome action ſuitable to the paſſion
he was hurryed by. At firſt all his thoughts ran upon ſome thing
that was violent and fatal; and when he imagined to himſelf that
his Rival was happier then he, did not onely deprive him of what
he loved, but might haply be the cauſe of all <hi>Tullia</hi>'s rigour
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97242:20"/>
towards him, had prevented him by an affection, that made her
inſenſible of all the expreſſions he made to her of his, and exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated
her againſt him more than any conſideration of the death
of <hi>Cicero,</hi> he could not oppoſe the torrent of his reſentments, nor
think of any thing but the death of his Rival. <hi>How,</hi> ſaid he,
walking in a furious manner, <hi>it was then the love of</hi> Cecinna <hi>that
made</hi> Tullia's <hi>heart impenetrable as to all compaſſion; and it is</hi>
Cecinna <hi>that robs me of this unmerciful Beauty, and, with her, of
all the ſatisfaction and deſire of life<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> I wonder not,</hi> added he, <hi>at
his backwardneſſe to recover her picture, and the confidence he had
ſoon to be poſſeſſed of the perſon, hath made him take it the more
indifferently to ſee her fair image in the hands of an unfortunate
Rival. Tis the knowledge he had of my misfortune made him neglect
what haply both his intereſt and his honour had obliged him to do,
and I am ſatisfied he had courage enough to take the advice of his
reputation in that emergency, if the hope of a greater happineſſe
had not made him leſſe earneſt for what was of leſſe conſequence.</hi>
Whereupon he walked for a good while, without ſpeaking at all,
then breaking forth into his ordinary tranſports, <hi>Think not,</hi> Cecinna,
<hi>ſaid he, that I reſign</hi> Tullia <hi>to thee; as thou haſt done her picture to
me; it ſhall coſt thee the pureſt of thy bloud to diſpute whoſe ſhe
ſhall be, and ſince I have hazarded my life for her picture, it is but
juſt thou ſhouldſt venture ſomething for the perſon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This was the reſolution he took; but when he thought himſelf
fully confirmed in it, he met with ſuch difficulties in that deſign,
which he was not a little ſtartled at. He had reaſon to fear he
might diſpleaſe <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who, upon what had paſſed in his preſence
fearing the conſequence, had forbidden them very ſeverely to
attempt any thing one againſt another. Nay, there was yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more in it, as to what reſentment the Emperour might have
of it; for when he conſidered that he could not quarrel with
<hi>Cecinna</hi> upon the account of any intereſt in <hi>Tullia,</hi> without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
openly, and diſcovering at the ſame time the little regard
he had for the advantageous deſign which the Emperour and
<hi>Octavia</hi> had for him, and that in a conjuncture on which his abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
fortune depended, he knew not what courſe he ſhould take
to overcome that difficulty. And yet this was not conſiderable to
him, in compariſon of the fear he was in of <hi>Tullia's</hi> indignation,
as putting it out of all doubt that he muſt needs force her to the
extremities of enmity towards him, by putting himſelf in a poſture
to take away that mans life whom ſhe accepted for her Huſband.
To be ſhort, this conſideration prevailed ſo far upon him, that he
hardly minded the reſt, and how far ſoever he might be from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the cruel treatments he receaved from that incenced
Beauty, yet was his ſoule guilty of ſuch extraordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
towards her, that he would have lookt death in the
face with leſſe diſturbance, than the occaſion of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="36" facs="tcp:97242:21"/>
Theſe contradictions kept his thoughts in an aequilibrium in
ſo ſtrange a perplexity; ſo that finding it a hard matter to fix on
any thing, he continued ſome dayes without faſtening on any reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.
During that time he delighted altogether in ſolitude,
avoiding the company even of his Friend <hi>Scipio,</hi> and retiring into
the moſt ſolitary places, where he would not admit any of his own
people to be about him. Without the gate called <hi>Porta Capena,</hi>
there is a little Wood neer the fair Gardens of <hi>Metellus,</hi> where the
ſhadyneſſe and ſolitude of the place afford very pleaſant walking,
for ſuch as avoid company. <hi>Antonius</hi> going out of <hi>Metellus</hi>'s
Garden, was directed thither by his own cruel thoughts, or rather
by ſome genius, who would determine his irreſolutions. He
walked there a long time alone, (having left thoſe ſervants that he
brought with him from home, which he could not diſmiſſe, at the
Garden door of <hi>Metellus</hi>) and had endeavoured to find out,
though with no ſucceſſe, what might prevent the happineſſe of
<hi>Cecinna,</hi> without any violation of the reſpect he ought <hi>Tullia,</hi>
or incurring the diſpleaſure, (if it were poſſible) of the generous
<hi>Octavia</hi> and the Emperour, when coming to a croſſe-walk, he ſpies
a man coming all alone towards the place where he was, and
having looked on him very attentively, when he was come ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
neer, he found him to be <hi>Cecinna.</hi> The ſight of him enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Antonius</hi> with indignation and jealouſie; and though he
ſuſpected what deſign brought <hi>Cecinna</hi> towards him, yet did he
miſtruſt his own thoughts of miſtake, and was in ſome fear he
ſhould not have ſo much power over himſelf as to reflect, in that
emergency, upon thoſe conſiderations whereby his hands were as
yet tyed up. In this uncertainty he expected him as ready to
fight, and in ſuch a poſture as put <hi>Cecinna</hi> into ſome diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Now my Brother being a perſon of higher quality in</hi> Rome <hi>than
he was, and his intereſt conſequently, with thoſe that managed
the ſupreme power, much greater, he was more cautious and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect
in what he undertook, then he had haply been with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perſon, whoſe fortunes had been meaner; and accordingly
coming very civilly towards him,</hi> It hath been my buſineſſe for ſome

have given you all you could have expected, anſwered <hi>Antonius,</hi> if I
had had but the leaſt notice of your deſires, and ſince you now have
as much freedom as you could have wiſhed; neglect not this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to acquatnt me with what you think ſit to let me know. I doubt
not, replyed <hi>Cecinna,</hi> but you know that ſufficiently well already, and
if you but remember that <hi>Tullia's</hi> picture is ſtill in your hands, you
are at the ſame time ſatisfied of the great concernment <hi>I</hi> have to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
you to return it to me. <hi>I</hi> have not deſired it of you while <hi>I</hi>
was of opinion it might be gotten out of your hands without my
interpoſition. But now that the intereſt of <hi>Tullia,</hi> and that of her
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97242:21"/>
friends hath proved ineffectual, you will not think it ſtrange, if, as
things now ſtand between us, <hi>I</hi> endeavour to obtain that from you
which you had denyed them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Antonius</hi> looking on him with a ſcornful ſmile, There is indeed
but very little likelihood, <hi>ſaid he to him, I</hi> ſhould grant <hi>Cecinna</hi> what
<hi>I</hi> had denyed <hi>Emilia:</hi> beſides, <hi>I</hi> am of opinion, that if you had been
ſo deſirous of <hi>Tullia's</hi> picture, you would have gone for it to the
place whence <hi>I</hi> took it. Though <hi>I</hi> was much leſſe obliged to do it than
you, it were unjuſt <hi>I</hi> ſhould, with the hazard of my life, procure a
thing you had ſlighted, to beſtow it on you with ſo much eaſe, and
you may haply find your ſelf very much miſtaken, if you imagine
there may be leſſe danger to get it out of my hands, then to recover
it out of the <hi>Area</hi> of the Amphitheatre. Had there been any neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for that action, <hi>replyed Cecinna, I</hi> ſhould have done it as well as
you: And if there had been any juſtice, <hi>interrupted</hi> Antonius <hi>very
roundly,</hi>
to reſtore what <hi>I</hi> had ſo well gotten, <hi>I</hi> had reſtored it to
<hi>Emilia,</hi> and not to you. However it be, <hi>Cecinna,</hi> you ought not to
expect it, as being the laſt of all men for whom <hi>I</hi> ſhould have that
complyance. I thought indeed, replyed <hi>Cecinna,</hi> I ſhould be forced
to thoſe extremities with you, which the Emperour hath forbidden
us: and it is with that deſign that <hi>I</hi> ſought you out, reſolved to
take away either your life, or <hi>Tullia's</hi> picture. This is it <hi>I</hi> expected
from thee, replyed <hi>Antonius</hi> fiercely, and which <hi>I</hi> thought I had ſo
ſufficiently obliged thee to, as to make thee contemn all other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
                        <p>With theſe words they both layd hands on their ſwords, and
drew at the ſame time, there being not any body neer to hinder
them. They exchanged a many blows, with much more fury then cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection.
<hi>Cecinna</hi> fought with abundance of courage, but with
little good fortune; and being over-raſh and inconſiderate, he
receaved two mortal wounds in the body, upon which he fell
down at my Brother's feet, with very little remainder of life.
<hi>Antonius</hi> had no doubt wiſhed the death of <hi>Cecinna,</hi> and had
behaved himſelf in that duel with abundance of indignation and
animoſity againſt him; but being a perſon of a great and noble
ſoul, ſeeing him fall with all the mortal ſignes, his anger vaniſhed,
and compaſſion took place in his heart, into which the paſſions
whereby it was then moved, were not againſt its admittance. He
came to <hi>Cecinna,</hi> to do him all the good he could, and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſtop his bloud, perſwaded him to take courage, by all the
words which might expreſſe the regret and ſorrow he concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at his misfortune.</p>
                        <p>But while he was employed in this compaſſionate office, there
comes, by an accident, you cannot but be aſtoniſhed at, a Chariot,
full of Ladies, to take the pleaſure of a ſolitary walk in the
Wood, to the place where they were: and the Ladies, who intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to take a walk, being got out of the Chariot, came on eaſily
without any jealouſie of what had happened, to the very place
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97242:22"/>
where the unfortunate <hi>Cecinna</hi> was expiring his laſt, in my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
arms. You may well imagine what aſtoniſhment this ſad
ſpectacle raiſed in the Ladies; but it will be hard for you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave
that of my Brother, when with <hi>Emilia</hi> and ſome other
Ladies of his acquaintance, he ſaw the cruel <hi>Tullia,</hi> that very
<hi>Tullia</hi> whom he had ſo well engraven in his ſoul. I leave it to
you to ſupply the difficulty of expreſſion I meet with in this ſtrange
rencounter, ſo hard is it for me to give you an account of the
agitations of theſe two ſouls in ſo unexpected an adventure. If
<hi>Antonius</hi> was ſurprized to ſee that <hi>Tullia</hi> whom he adored, that
<hi>Tullia,</hi> who ſhunned him with all the cruelty imaginable; nay,
the ſame <hi>Tullia,</hi> whoſe Lover, that was to be within a few dayes
her Huſband, he had killed; you may well think that <hi>Tullia,</hi> on
the other ſide, was not leſſe aſtoniſhed to meet with that <hi>Antonius,</hi>
whom ſhe avoided, ſtanding over the expiring <hi>Cecinna,</hi> and ſoiled
with the bloud of a man ſhe was to be married to. She had
not had, tis true, any violent affection for him, yet it is withall
certain ſhe had no diſ-inclination towards him; and ſince ſhe had
been acquainted with the deſign her Brother had to make her his
Wife, ſhe had entertained in her heart all the love ſhe thought
her ſelf obliged to have, for a perſon that was ſhortly to be her
Huſband: ſo that ſhe could not ſee him weltring in his bloud, and
expiring at his enemies feet, without feeling an extraordinary
affliction, and whatever her ſoul was capable of, upon an accident
of that nature. She at firſt ſight gave a great outcry, and was
ready to ſwound in <hi>Emilia's</hi> arms, who made a ſhift to hold her up,
and, a little after, caſting her eyes on both <hi>Antonius</hi> and <hi>Cecinna,</hi>
on the one, with all the demonſtrations of compaſſion, and on the
other with all thoſe of indignation, ſheding tears for <hi>Cecinna,</hi> and
darting forth her wrathful looks on <hi>Antonius,</hi> ſhe continued for
ſome minutes in an uncertainty as to what reſolution ſhe ſhould
take, whether to avoid what ſhe hated, or to ſuccour what ſhe was
obliged to love. And whereas ſhe ſeemed to be rather carried away
by the averſion ſhe had for my Brother, or at leaſt inclined rather
to the motives ſhe conceaved ſhe had to avoid him, then to the
affection ſhe had for <hi>Cecinna,</hi> her firſt reflections ſeemed to engage
her to avoid the face of an enemy, eſpecially he being ſuch a one
as confirmed himſelf to be ſuch, by the action he had then done.
But afterwards, upon ſecond thoughts, ſhe, being a Lady that
choſe rather to be guided by her duty then her paſſions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved
her ſelf obliged to relieve <hi>Cecinna</hi> dying upon her account,
rather then to avoid <hi>Antonius,</hi> comes to him, with her face bathed
in tears, and by certain broken words entreated him to take
heart, and to further all he could the deſign ſhe had for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of his life. The expiring <hi>Cecinna</hi> met with this ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
in his misfortune, that he breathed out his laſt in the arms
of <hi>Tullia,</hi> and muſtering up all the ſtrength he had left him, to turn
his eyes towards her, and to take her by the hand, ſhe reached
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97242:22"/>
forth to him, while one of her Mayds held up his head in her lap;
<hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>I looſe my life by the hands of</hi> Antonius,
<hi>but it was through my own fault and ſeeking; and therefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you to forgive him my death as heart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ly as</hi> I <hi>do my ſelf. The
compaſſion, he takes at my misfortune, deſerves yours; and</hi> I <hi>dye
happy and glorious, ſince I dye at your feet, for your ſake,
and in a condition that forces thoſe fair ſhowers from your
eyes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>With much difficulty was he delivered of theſe words, but
with them he loſt his ſpeech, and, ſome few minutes after, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
out his laſt, leaving in <hi>Tullias</hi> ſoul ſuch violent characters of
paſſion, that ſhe hardly knew where ſhe was, or what ſhe did. My
Brother, to give her way, retired ſome few paces when ſhe came
neer <hi>Cecinna;</hi> and being extreamly moved with pity for his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
the affliction he perceaved it was to <hi>Tullia</hi> heightened his
own ſo much and ſo violently, that he had much ado to keep off
from deſpair. He, at firſt, thought himſelf obliged to avoid the
eyes of that incenſed Beauty; nay, though he was infinitely deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to have a ſight of her, yet muſt he needs imagine, that, as
things then ſtood, he could not without inhumanity importune her
with his. Out of this conſideration had he already retired ſome
few paces; but his paſſion growing too ſtrong for him, would needs
oblige him to ſpeak to her, and to make ſome reparation for the
injury he had done her. This reſolution grew ſo ſtrong upon
him, that he could not reſiſt it, and ſo ſlighting all thoſe reflections
that were incompatible with the violence of his love, he came
ſome paces neerer, he looked on that deſolate Beauty, with all
the agitations that a ſoul that hath loſt all command of it ſelf can
be capable of. He had not hardly had the confidence to open his
mouth, had he not been encouraged by the preſence of <hi>Emilia,</hi>
whom he knew to be favourable to him, and from whom he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
ſome relief. But at laſt, having rallyed all the courage he
had, he ſets one knee on the ground, and looking on Tullia in a
trembling poſture; <hi>I ſhould not preſume to importune you with my
ſight, Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>if</hi> I <hi>thought not my ſelf obliged
to make you ſome ſatisfaction for the injury</hi> I <hi>have done you; and
though</hi> Cecinna <hi>hath in ſome ſort juſtified me, by telling you that
I onely ſtood in a defenſive poſture againſt him, yet the diſpleaſure</hi>
I <hi>have done you is greater then to be paſſed over with ſuch a repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
There was no need of this laſt misfortune to heighten the
averſion you have ever had for the unfortunate perſon that now
adores you; and this ſight of you, which I ſo earneſtly beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
before, ſhould not have been granted me, together with that
of an accident which can raiſe in you nothing but horrour for
this ſo unhappy a wretch. But ſince it is the diſpoſal of Heaven,
it is but juſt that both Heavens anger and yours ſhould be appeaſed:
and ſince</hi> I <hi>am already ſo well acquainted with your heart, as to
believe I ſhall find in you all the reſolution requiſite to revenge
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97242:23"/>
your ſelf, and to do right to the</hi> Manes <hi>of</hi> Cecinna, <hi>here take the
ſword,</hi> (continued he, drawing it, and preſenting her with the hilt)
<hi>take the ſword that hath taken away the life of</hi> Cecinna, <hi>thruſt it
into this breaſt which lyes open to you, and ſpare not, after the injury</hi>
I <hi>have done you, a life, which, even in a condition of innocence hath
ever been odious to you.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>At theſe words <hi>Tullia,</hi> who all the while would not ſo much as
look towards him, but turned her face another way, gave him
ſuch a ſudden and furious look, that haply upon the firſt ſallies of
the violent paſſions ſhe was then abſolutely ſubject to, ſhe might
have granted the deſolate <hi>Antonius</hi> the death he ſo much deſired,
and that accordingly ſhe would have taken the ſword he preſented
to her, and whereof the very ſight very much enflamed her indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
when ſhe perceaved upon it certain drops of <hi>Cecinna's</hi>
blood. But the prudent <hi>Emilia</hi> faſtening immediately upon it,
got it, without much difficulty, from <hi>Antonius;</hi> and this ſhe
did, as well in regard of the uncertainty ſhe was in as to
<hi>Tullia's</hi> intention, as to prevent that deſperate Prince,
from making uſe of it againſt himſelfe, as he might have
done, in the diſtraction his griefe had then put him
into.</p>
                        <p>Tullia <hi>continued for ſome time without ſo much as opening
her mouth, expreſſing the agitations of her ſoule by her looks
and ſilence more effectually than ſhe could haply have done by
her words. But at laſt, not able to maſter the impetuoſity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and looking on the proſtrate</hi> Antonius <hi>with eyes, wherein,
through the tears that fell from them, the fire of her indignation
diſcovered it ſelf but too apparently;</hi> Vnmercifull diſturber of
my quiet, <hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> thou who being the iſſue of my Fathers
Executioners, art reſolved not to degenerate from their cruelty;
Is it poſſible that thy inhumanity cannot be ſatisfied either
with the bloud of <hi>Cicero,</hi> ſpilt by thy Friends, nor with
that of <hi>Cecinna,</hi> which thou haſt ſhed thy ſelf, but thou muſt
perſecute to the death an Vnfortunate Mayd, who hath not
without reaſon avoided thee, and who never yet gave thee the
leaſt offence? Doſt thou hope, ſtained with the bloud of
him that was to be her Husband, that ſhe can regard that
odious paſſion, which hath proved the cauſe of all her
unhappineſſe? Or doſt thou imagine ſhe can look otherwiſe
on thee than a Monſter, and the fouleſt object of deteſtation
and horrour? Go <hi>Barbarian,</hi> go Sonne of <hi>Fulvia,</hi> and diſturb
no longer the Daughter of the Vnfortunate <hi>Cicero,</hi> for whom thy
cruelty hath opened a ſource of tears, which no paſſion could ever
have made her ſhed.</p>
                        <p>As ſhe uttered theſe words, which came from her, attended with
a deluge of tears, ſhe reſted her face on <hi>Emelia's</hi> arme, when
<hi>Scipio,</hi> who was then in queſt of either his Miſtreſſe or his
Friend, came into the place, directed thither haply by the gods,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97242:23"/>
to prevent my Brother's deſpair. He was in few words made
acquainted with all that paſt; and though compaſſion had that
effect which it could not but produce in him, yet he made a ſhift
to ſmother it, the better to ſerve his Friend, and ſo joyned with
<hi>Emilia</hi> to oppoſe thoſe ſentiments of hatred and indignation
which <hi>Tullia</hi> had conceaved againſt my Brother. But, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all their arguments, intreaties and remonſtrances, ſhe
was ſtill as inflexible as ever, and the ſuppliant poſture wherein
<hi>Antonius</hi> had continued all this while, nor the abundance
of tears he ſhed after her example, could not raiſe in her
the leaſt touch of compaſſion, nor any way moderate her exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>When he ſaw that the mediation of</hi> Emilia <hi>and his Friend
proved altogether ineffectual, riſing up from the place where
he was, and looking very dreadfully on</hi> Tullia, I now ſee
<hi>Tullia, ſaid he to her,</hi> that nothing but my death can ſatisfie you,
and I were very much to blame, if, being neer the dead body of
<hi>Cecinna,</hi> I ſhould hope to find that pitty from you, which in the
greateſt innocence of my life, and amidſt the moſt prevalent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of my love I could never obtain: nor indeed was it to your
compaſſion that I addreſſed my ſelf, but I defied the implacable
averſion you have for me to put a period to that life, for
which you have ſo much horrour. I muſt confeſſe, I ſhould have
embraced death more kindly from your hands then my own, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaving
your revenge would be the more abſolute, when you took
it your ſelf. But ſince <hi>Emilia</hi> hath deprived you of that ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
which yet had been but proportionable to the grief
I have innocently cauſed you, I ſhall make it my own buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to ſacrifice to you the remainder of this life, which hath been
ſo unfortunately preſerved, and is ſo cruelly abhorred.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>With theſe words he pretended as if he would goe away
with an action not far from extravagance; but</hi> Scipio, <hi>who,
during his diſcourſe, was gotten neer him, ſtayed him, and</hi>
Tullia, <hi>implacable as ſhe was, yet having abundance of vertue
about her, would not leave in the perſons that heard her, the
ſentiments which her diſtraction might have raiſed in them, ſo
that endeavouring once more to expreſſe her ſelf to</hi> Antonius,
<hi>yet without looking on him:</hi> I come not out of a cruel race, ſuch
as this is, <hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> nor do I deſire any bloudy reparations
for the injury thou haſt done me. <hi>I</hi> neither wiſh thy death nor thy
life, and leave thee Maſter of a Fate wherein I never intend to
be any wayes engaged: but if the horrid outrages which my
family and my ſelf have receaved front thee and thine, may give me
leave to hope any ſatisfaction from thee, I entreat, as thou doſt
reſpect Heaven, or what ever elſe may be dear to thee, that thou never
appear before me again, and that thou free me for ever hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
of a ſight which neither is nor ought to be any way ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to me. This thou canſt not refuſe me, if thou haſt any ſpark
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:97242:24"/>
of vertue left in thee: and if thou grant it me, <hi>I</hi> engage my ſelf
never to deſire either of the gods or men any revenge againſt thee,
and that I ſhall not be guiltie of ſo much as a wiſh that may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
any thing to the diſturbance of thy life. 'Tis but juſt,
Madam, <hi>ſaid</hi> Antonius <hi>to her, who was already reſolved what to
do;</hi> I ſhall give you the ſatisfaction you deſire of me, though it be
more inſufferable then what <hi>I</hi> had offered you my ſelf, and I proteſt to
you, that you ſhall never while you live ſee again that unfortunate
perſon whom you thus condemn to eternal baniſhment. <hi>With which
words he went away along with</hi> Scipio, <hi>who would not by any
means leave him, out of a fear of ſome effect of his deſpair;
and not long after</hi> Emilia, <hi>and the other Ladies, having cauſed the
body of</hi> Cecinna <hi>to be brought away, returned into the City in the
confuſed condition which it is not hard for you to imagine to
your ſelf.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I ſhall not trouble you, Siſter, either with the grief of <hi>Cecinna's</hi>
Friends and <hi>Cicero's,</hi> or with the diſpleaſure of the Emperour at
that action, wherein yet he could not much blame my Brother,
after he had underſtood the circumſtances of it. But I muſt needs
tell you, that <hi>Antonius,</hi> having ſpent the night with <hi>Scipio,</hi> who
would by no means leave him till he were a little recovered,
vaniſhed the next morning, and hath not been ſeen ſince in
any part of the earth that ever we could hear of, though he
hath been ſought out every where. He went away with a very
ſmall retinue, purpoſely to avoid being diſcovered in the places
through which he paſſed, and where he intended to ſpend his life,
onely he left a letter for <hi>Scipio,</hi> wherein he intreated him to
make his excuſes to all thoſe to whom he was obliged to make any,
either out of reſpects of birth, or any other conſiderations, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deſiring him, not to enquire after the place of his retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
proteſting to him that he knew it not himſelf, and that he
was reſolved to wander up and down the World, till he were
quite recovered of <hi>Tullia's</hi> love, and then he promiſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to <hi>Rome,</hi> and not before. <hi>Scipio</hi> and all his Friends ſent
ſome after him for certain dayes, but they returned to <hi>Rome</hi>
very much troubled that they could meet with no tidings
of him. <hi>Tullia</hi> extreamly caſt down, and in a manner diſtracted
at this unhappy adventure left <hi>Rome</hi> ſome few dayes after, and
returned to her ſolitude, where ſhe continued for many years.
And thus, by a paſſion fatally enflamed, Have we loſt a Brother?
a great and excellent perſon. It is ſix or ſeaven years ſince this
loſſe happened, which yet I was ſenſible of, before it could be
thought one of my age could be ſenſible of any ſuch thing, and in
regard that it is ſince that time that all the remarkable accidents of
my life are happened, my Brother could not be any way concerned
in them. And thence it came, that I made no mention of him in
the relation of all the misfortunes which the love of <hi>Coriolanus</hi>
hath engaged me in. I ſhall now proceed to the adventures of the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97242:24"/>
reſt of our Family, which having happened long ſince the other,
I have accordingly freſh in my memory.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Here the fair</hi> Cleopatra <hi>made a ſtop to take her breath a little,
and</hi> Artemiſa, <hi>who had heard her with very much attention,
without ever interrupting her all the time, ſeeing her come to
that place,</hi> Good Heaven, Siſter, <hi>ſaid ſhe to her,</hi> what an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
oligation have you put upon me by this diſcourſe of yours?
and what regret have you raiſed in me for the ſad fortune of that
Brother of yours, who in all probability, would have loſt nothing
of the luſtre of your noble houſe? How angry have I been with that
inflexible <hi>Tullia,</hi> who made ſo little diſtinction between the innocent
and the guilty, and how different have our ſentiments been, though
we have met with equal occaſions to expreſſe them? I could not
abſolutely diſapprove the carriage of <hi>Tullia, replies Cleopatra,</hi>
though it were ſomewhat too violent at the latter end. At ſo bloudy
a ſpectacle as that of the death of <hi>Cecinna,</hi> ſhe could not be leſſe
troubled then ſhe ſeemed to be, and in the beginning, though <hi>Antonius</hi>
were innocent, yet was he Son to thoſe who had put her Father to a
death notorious for the cruelty of its circumſtances. And if there
were no reaſon ſhe ſhould be deſirous to be revenged upon him, ſo was
there not on the other ſide any that ſhould engage her to admit his
converſation, much leſſe the expreſſions of his affection. In your
fortune things are very much different; your friendſhip took its
firſt riſe from your infancy, and from that time you have been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
to endure the preſence of <hi>Alexander,</hi> not as that of their Son
who had put <hi>Artabaſus</hi> to death, but as that of a Prince that ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
you, and for whom ever from that time you had no averſion. <hi>The

TIS ſince the loſſe of our Brother <hi>Julius Antonius,</hi>
as I told you, that ſo many memorable accidents
have happened in our Family, ſuch as no doubt
but he would have concerned himſelf in, as he
ought to have done, had he not been abſent, nay,
it may be, abſolutely loſt. It was much about the
time of his departure that <hi>Coriolanus</hi> made the firſt addreſſes of
his love to me, or it was then at leaſt that I was come to an age,
wherein I ſeriouſly began to take notice of them. I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
acquainted you with all that hath befallen me ſince, even to
the moſt inconſiderable circumſtances, ſo that I am diſpenſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
as to any relation that concerns my ſelf, though what hath
happened to me be of greater conſequence than any thing elſe
that hath befallen our Family. For what relates to <hi>Alexander,</hi> you
have been acquainted with the adventures of his firſt years to his
departure from <hi>Rome;</hi> and for what hath happened to him ſince,
I have learned it from your ſelf, who muſt needs have been the
beſt acquainted of any with his adventures, as having been the
onely occaſion thereof. All then that now lyes on my hands to
do, is, to give you an account of young <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> of the Children
of <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and, of thoſe of <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Octavia,</hi>
of my two Siſters, <hi>Agrippina</hi> and young <hi>Antonia,</hi> whom you have
ſo particular an affection for. For <hi>Ptolomey</hi> he is yet of an age
wherein it cannot be expected he ſhould meet with many adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
though the World hath, from ſeveral particular actions of
his, conceaved very miraculous hopes of him, and for my Siſters,
I ſhall punctually acquaint you with all you deſire to know con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two Princeſſes, born, no doubt, to all the perfections of
nature, have extreamlie improved and heightned them by an
excellent education, for I need ſay no more to you then that they
have been brought up by their Mother <hi>Octavia,</hi> to let you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
what advantages they might derive from that. <hi>Agrippina</hi>
is certainlie a verie rare and exquiſite Beautie, hath a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of underſtanding, and is of an exemplarie vertue; nay, it
will haplie be found that the World is but poorlie ſtored with
perſons whoſe accompliſhments and perfections may come into the
ballance with thoſe of this Princeſſe. Yet is it as certain that
<hi>Antonia</hi> ſurpaſſes her in all things, and though Heaven hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
on her a Beautie of the firſt magnitude among thoſe
terreſtrial conſtellations, whoſe influences the earth adores and is
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97242:26"/>
guided by, yet is this Beauty of her perſon much below that of
her mind, and that of her inclinations. Never was there any one
of her ſex that had a mind fixed with ſo much ſoliditie, refined
by ſo much puritie, and heightned by ſo great a diſengagement
from things that are inconſiderable and beneath her. It diſcovers
ſuch a conſonancy of ſweetneſſe and ſeverity, as amounts to a juſt
moderation, and all her actions are guided by ſo certain a rule,
that they defie whatever the moſt irreconcileable malice durſt
object againſt them. I could tell you much more of her, Siſter,
and yet be in ſome fear I might not ſpeak enough, ſince it is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyable,
that, taking her in all things, there cannot be any thing
more accompliſhed then <hi>Antonia,</hi> and it is generally acknowledged
in <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Octavia,</hi> the honour and ornament of her Time, could
not have furniſhed the World with any thing elſe that were more
worthy her ſelf, or more like her Mother in all her great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
perfections.</p>
                     <p>It is not many years, ſince <hi>Domitius Aenobarbus,</hi> a man Illuſtrious
enough by his extraction, but much more for his great employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and the noble actions he did, addreſſed his affections to
<hi>Agrippina,</hi> and afterwards became an earneſt and conſtant Servant of
hers. And in regard his engagement in this deſign was not without
the approbation of the Emperour, <hi>Octavia,</hi> and, in a word, of all
thoſe perſons whoſe countenance he ſtood in need of, <hi>Agrippina,</hi>
out of pure complyance with <hi>Octavia,</hi> entertained his addreſſes
with the eſteem and acknowledgement ſhe was obliged to, and,
without any repugnance or violence of paſſion, was reſolved to
ſubmit to the diſpoſal of thoſe perſons to whom ſhe ought an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
But, on the contrary, <hi>Antonia,</hi> having a diſ-inclination to
love, and an averſion for whatever had but the leaſt appearance of
gallantry, had ſpent all the years of her life to this very laſt, not
onelie without loving, but even without ſo much as enduring any
diſcourſe, or indeed the leaſt diſcoverie of any ſuch thing, though
her extraordinarie Beautie, and the amiable excellencies of her
perſon had raiſed her no ſmall number of ſervants among thoſe of
greateſt qualitie upon earth.</p>
                     <p>Among the moſt eminent of thoſe that had any thoughts for
her, <hi>Archelaus,</hi> King of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> a young Prince, of great valour,
and abundance of vertue, was one of the firſt that declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a ſervant of hers: and certainly, if an exceſſe of merit height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by ſervices, full of paſſion and reſpect, might have had any
influence on the heart of <hi>Antonia,</hi> it was not improbable they
ſhould faile of their effection it, on the behalf of that Prince. His
allyance with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or rather his dependance on the Empire, to
which his dominions were tributary, (as were thoſe of moſt
Kings upon earth) obliged him to be very much reſident
at <hi>Rome,</hi> where all other Kings as well as he were
forced to make their conſtant addreſſes to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:97242:27"/>
Twas in one of theſe voyages that he became a ſacrifice to the
fair eyes of <hi>Antonia,</hi> and upon that account ſtayed longer in <hi>Rome</hi>
then he had reſolved to do. Whole yeares paſt away ere he durſt
make his caſe known, or any way diſcover himſelf to her, who
was the occaſion of all his ſufferings. And though that during
this time he travelled very much up and down, either within his
own Kingdom, or into thoſe of his next neighbours, whither the
war often drew him, yet was his love his perpetual attendant, and
upon the leaſt occaſion brought him ſtill to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he had
left the fair object of his paſſion. When ever he felt in himſelf
any inclination to diſcover to <hi>Antonia</hi> what he ſuffered for her
ſake, her ſeveritie, and that modeſt fierceneſſe ſhe was ſubject to
put him to immediate ſilence: and whereas upon all other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
he was never known to be awanting as to courage, yet all that
great confidence he was naturally maſter of, proved, as to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
abſolutely unſerviceable, and that out of no other conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
then that he was not ignorant of the inflexible humour of
<hi>Antonia.</hi> But at laſt he ventured to break forth into ſpeech,
after he had uſhered in the diſcourſe by thouſands of actions which
might have ſignified no leſſe then what he ſpoke; but this firſt
overture of his proved ſo little to his ſatisfaction, that for a long
time after he could never reflect on it without a certain regret,
which muſt needs be the greater, in that <hi>Antonia,</hi> who till then
had ſuffered his converſation as ſhe would do that of a Prince,
eminent for his vertue, and high in the eſteem of all the World,
could not endure to hear from his own mouth, the firſt declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a paſſion which ſhe had a natural averſion for, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
it with ſuch a reſentment, as eaſilie put her upon a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to avoid all occaſions of diſcourſe with him. However,
after ſome time ſhe was perſwaded to endure it, but not ſo much
out of any remorſe of her inclinations, as by the mediation of
<hi>Octavia,</hi> who would not have her treat, with diſdain and incivili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
a King of extraordinary merit, as alſo upon the advice of her
Brother <hi>Marcellus,</hi> whom ſhe had very great reſpects for, and who
highly eſteemed <hi>Archelaus.</hi> But after all, the greateſt advantage
he made of this forbearance amounted not to ſo much as to make
his condition any whit the better; and if <hi>Antonia</hi> gave him
ſometimes leave to waite on her, and to fall into diſcourſe with
her, yet could he never either from his addreſſes or converſation
infer the leaſt hope they might ever prove effectual, or derive any
other comfort from them, ſave that of being aſſured, that his
Rivalls, (who no doubt were not a few, and thoſe very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable)
were not treated any thing more favourably than
himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Beſides <hi>Archelaus,</hi> there was a great number of other Princes
at <hi>Rome,</hi> and there daylie came ſome from all parts, as I told you,
to do homage, and make their acknowledgements to the Lord of
the greateſt part of the Univerſe. Among the moſt accompliſhed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:97242:27"/>
were <hi>Mithridates</hi> and <hi>Polemon,</hi> perſons whom their excellent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
made accordingly conſiderable, it being indeed upon
the account of their vertue, (which added a great luſtre and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to their birth) that they had not long before receaved
Crowns from the liberalitie of <hi>Auguſtus; Polemou</hi> that of <hi>Pontus,</hi>
and <hi>Mithridates</hi> that of <hi>Comagenes. Mithridates,</hi> a perſon natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie
confident and daring, and of high and aſpiring thoughts;
captivated by the perfections of <hi>Julia,</hi> and flattered into ſome
hopes through her eaſineſſe, in admitting addreſſes and adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
made no great ſecret for ſome time of the inclinations he
had for her: but at length, ſeized with a fear of diſpleaſing
<hi>Marcellus,</hi> whom all the World very much reſpected as well for
his reputation as his vertue, and to incenſe the Emperour himſelf,
who would not have taken it kindlie that his Daughter ſhould be
cajolled into any other affection then that of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> on whom
he had reſolved to beſtow her, he was forced to ſmother his firſt
inclinations, and after he had continued for ſome conſiderable
time in an uncertainty, without being able to faſten on any choice,
he at laſt ran the ſame fate with a many others, and became an
admirer of the excellencies of <hi>Antonia,</hi> and accordingly put
himſelf into the ſame praedicament with <hi>Archelaus, Polemon,</hi>
on the other ſide, continued Maſter of Liberty for a long time,
but at laſt was forced to ſacrifice it to <hi>Marcella,</hi> Daughter to
<hi>Octavia,</hi> by her former Huſband, and Siſter, both by Father and
Mother, to Prince <hi>Marcellus:</hi> but his engagement into that affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was with very little hope, or rather very little likelyhood of
any good ſucceſſe; not but that his great worth and high birth
were very conſiderable, but, it was the generall belief that the
Emperour had long before deſigned his Neece the Princeſſe
<hi>Marcella</hi> for Wife to the great <hi>Agrippa,</hi> a perſon ſo conſiderable
in point of reputation and intereſt, as not to be pararelled by
<hi>Polemon,</hi> or indeed by any other perſon in the Empire, unleſſe it
were by Prince <hi>Marcellus</hi> himſelf. His younger Siſter by the
ſame marriage, named <hi>Martia,</hi> a Princeſſe of an excellent Beauty,
an admirable wit, and a diſpoſition full of ſweetneſſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance,
had alſo a great number of Suitors; and you are not
to imagine but that Princeſſes of ſuch worth, extractions and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts
were more likely to raiſe deſires than hopes in the hearts of
ſuch perſons as were the moſt eminent.</p>
                     <p>I have purpoſely given you this ſmall account that you may
thence infer what a noble and great Court there muſt needs be
at <hi>Octavia</hi>'s, where we were no leſſe then five Princeſſes, who,
next to <hi>Julia,</hi> might, not without reaſon, pretend to the firſt rank
among all thoſe of the Empire, and that had had the honour to
be brought up by the conduct of a perſon, whoſe vertue
is a thouſand times more conſiderable then all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
ſhe might have derived from either her Birth or her
Fortune.</p>

Beſides thoſe that I have named to you, that were particularly
related to the Imperial Houſe, or were otherwiſe of Royal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,
there was at <hi>Rome</hi> a great number of thoſe Illuſtrious
Families, which are no way inferiour to thoſe of Kings, as alſo of
thoſe Conſular Houſes, whereof the chiefes have ſo often led
Kings in Triumph, and diſpoſed of Kingdoms as if they had been
their own private eſtates. The admirable <hi>Sulpicia,</hi> Daughter to
<hi>Lucius Metellus,</hi> the Beautiful <hi>Hortenſia,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Caius Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulus,
Servilia,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Servilius Hala, Flavia,</hi> of the Noble
Bloud of the <hi>Fabii, Sabina,</hi> of that of the famous <hi>Scipio's,</hi> and
the diſcreet <hi>Virginia,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Catulus,</hi> were, as I may
ſay, in reſpect of us of the ſecond magnitude. In like manner,
among the men, the very ſame Families, and others of that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
had produced no ſmall number of ſuch, as, in all probability
ſhould not degenerate from the glory of their Anceſtors; and as
to matter of magnificence and gallantry, next to <hi>Marcellus,</hi> the
Sons of <hi>Livia,</hi> and the Princes I have already mentioned to you,
young <hi>Craſſus,</hi> Son to thoſe of that name, who died among the
<hi>Parthians,</hi> a perſon already arrived to the fame of divers Noble
Victories, young <hi>Catulus, Albinus, Ciuna, Lentulus, Flavianus</hi> the
Son of <hi>Scaurus, Aemilianus,</hi> of the race of the <hi>Scipio's,</hi> and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelianus</hi>
deſcended of that of the <hi>Cato's,</hi> were the moſt Eminent
and Remarkable in <hi>Rome,</hi> as well for their excellent endowments,
as their Pomp and Magnificence. All theſe perſons, or at leaſt the
greateſt part of them, came every day to the Empreſſe's Court,
or to the Princeſſe <hi>Julia's,</hi> or to us, or to <hi>Scribonia's,</hi> or to <hi>Teren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia's,</hi>
the Wife of <hi>Mecenas,</hi> and it may be well affirmed, that there
never was any thing of oſtentation, and magnificence, comparable
to what was ſeen in the publick ſhews, and divertiſements, that
theſe Illuſtrious Perſons daylie entertained us with, and that with
ſuch prodigality and profuſions, as it were impoſſible to meet
with in any other place, then a City that is Lady of the
Univerſe, and ſurfeted with the ſpoiles of ſo many King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
                     <p>I need not tell you, Siſter, that I have all this while digreſſed
from what I had firſt undertaken, purpoſely to give you a ſlight
deſcription of <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s Court, and that out of a confidence you
would not take it amiſſe to be acquainted with the names of thoſe
perſons that are the moſt conſiderable in the Univerſe. I ſhall
therefore now return to our own Familie, and give you a punctual
account of all that you deſire to know concerning it, omitting, out
of deſign, what happened long ſince, the more to haſten to a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of what hath happened within theſe late years, as well becauſe
it is of greateſt conſequence, as that it is freſheſt in my memory,
and moſt within my knowledge.</p>
                     <p>That you may therefore be the better informed as to what
concerns the affairs of our Familie, you are to know, That <hi>Julius
Antonius,</hi> as I have alreadie told you, had been loſt for ſome five
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97242:28"/>
or ſix years; That I was at <hi>Rome</hi> expoſed to the cruel perſecution
of <hi>Tiberius;</hi> That <hi>Alexander</hi> was, not long before, gone from
<hi>Rome</hi> into the Army in <hi>Pannonia,</hi> whence it was that he came to
you; That <hi>Ptolomey</hi> was brought up in <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Court, all the
World conceaving miraculous hopes of him; That for our two
Siſters, that were born of <hi>Octavia, Agrippina</hi> was courted by
<hi>Domitius Aenobarbus,</hi> and the younger, <hi>Antonia</hi> by <hi>Archelaus,</hi> King
of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> and divers other Illuſtrious Perſons, as well among
the <hi>Romans,</hi> as among thoſe Princes that had their education in
<hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s Court, and that for the two Princeſſes, the Daughters
of <hi>Octavia</hi> and <hi>Marcellus,</hi> and whom we ſtill looked on as our
Siſters; <hi>Marcella</hi> was courted by <hi>Craſſus</hi> and <hi>Polemon,</hi> but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the general opinion, deſigned by the Emperour for the great
<hi>Agrippa;</hi> and the young and fair <hi>Martia,</hi> beſides a many other
Suitors and Adorers, whom her excellent perfections magnetically
drew after her, was moſt earneſtly courted by <hi>Aemilianus,</hi> one of
the houſe of the <hi>Scipio's,</hi> and young <hi>Catulus,</hi> both perſons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
conſiderable as well upon the ſcore of their vertues, as
extraordinary worth and parts. The other Ladies, whom I have
named to you, were alſo courted by the moſt Illuſtrious Perſons
about <hi>Rome,</hi> of <hi>Roman</hi> extraction, inſomuch that <hi>Rome</hi> was, in
point of galantry and magnificence, much beyond what I am able
to repreſent to you. The Emperour, who, as you know, is yet
in the flower of his age, and is naturally very much inclined to
whatever ſounds any thing of gallantry, gave himſelf the example
as to what tended that way, through the engagement and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
he then had, and ſtill hath for <hi>Terentia, Mecoenas</hi>'s Wife, a
Woman of great Beautie, and a vaſt-wit and underſtanding, but
with this diſadvantage as to her reputation, that the frequent
addreſſes and familiarity of the Emperour did her ſome injurie,
as being one, that, having been Wife to a man whoſe vertue the
whole Empire had a particular honour and veneration for, ſhould
have carryed her ſelf with that reſervedneſſe as might have been
proof againſt thoſe reports, which but too too often blaſt the moſt
circumſpect behaviours.</p>
                     <p>This excellent woman did the Emperour one day take occaſion
to entertain with a Comedy, Muſick, and walking, in the fair and
famous Gardens of <hi>Lucullus,</hi> and all the perſons I have named to
you, with divers others, whom I have not mentioned, were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the noble meeting. The firſt divertiſement they were
entertained with, while they expected the other, (which were not
to be had, but by torch-light) was that of Walking, ſo that the
Company being gotten into thoſe pleaſant walks, they took their
turns about, and ſaw all the rarities of the Garden, which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are admirable, and not below the report that is ſpread over the
World of it, and the charge, which the moſt ſumptuous of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
had been at about it. The Empreſſe, whoſe thoughts have
ever been more taken up with what related to her ambition
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:97242:29"/>
and State-Affairs, then with any thing elſe, pretending to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the Emperour's inclinations, and ſeeming not the leaſt
troubled thereat, would needs make one of that Aſſembly; and
while they walked, was led by <hi>Agrippa,</hi> though ſhe had no great
reſpects for him, and looked on the intereſt he had with <hi>Auguſtus,</hi>
with ſome jealouſie. <hi>Mecoenas</hi> waited on the Princeſſe <hi>Octavia,</hi>
and after her the Emperour himſelf led <hi>Terentia;</hi> after them
came <hi>Julia,</hi> led by <hi>Marcellus,</hi> and after her my ſelf, led by <hi>Tiberius.
Domitius</hi> had <hi>Agrippina</hi> by the arm, and King <hi>Archelaus</hi> the fair
<hi>Antonia. Marcella</hi> was conducted by Prince <hi>Polemon, Martia</hi> by
the gallant <hi>Craſſus; Sulpicia,</hi> by <hi>Lentulus, Hortenſia,</hi> by <hi>Flavianus;
Sabina,</hi> by <hi>Cinna, Servilia,</hi> by <hi>Emilianus, Flavia,</hi> by <hi>Albinus,
Virginia</hi> by <hi>Cornelianus,</hi> and the excellent <hi>Cipaſſis,</hi> (who for her
own worth, and the friendſhip which <hi>Julia</hi> had for her, was num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
among the moſt conſiderable) by <hi>Ovid.</hi> Beſides all theſe,
<hi>Druſus, Ptolomy, Mithridates,</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> whom they had brought
with them, and whom all the World reſpected, and was in love
with, for his admirable wit, having not any Ladies to wait on, or
being unwilling to engage themſelves any where againſt their
inclinations, very pleaſantly deſired leave to diſpoſe of themſelves
where they might meet with any hands free; which <hi>Livia</hi> having,
in the name of the whole companie, granted them, <hi>Druſus</hi> came
and took me by the hand, out of a confidence his Brother, who
had me by the other, would not take it amiſſe. <hi>Ptolemey</hi> addreſſed
himſelf to the beautiful <hi>Martia,</hi> who was led by <hi>Craſſus;</hi> the
daring <hi>Mithridates</hi> confidentlie faſtened on <hi>Antonia,</hi> who was led
by <hi>Archelaus;</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> after he had recollected himſelf a little
after a verie pleaſant manner, laid hold of <hi>Cipaſſis,</hi> who was led
by <hi>Ovid,</hi> and reaching him her hand, ſaid verie wittilie, that for
an unfortunate ſtranger, ſhe was not the worſt waited on in the
Companie, having thoſe two men about her.</p>
                     <p>This Noble Aſſembly, the nobleſt haplie that the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
could have afforded, went all together into a ſpacious walk,
covered in a manner with trees of an extraordinarie height, and
abutted, as all the reſt did, upon a large <hi>Baſin</hi> of Water, which is
in the midſt of the Garden, having in it one principal figure which
may be ſeen from all the extremities, and that is a <hi>Neptune,</hi> placed
in the midſt of the water, ſeated in his Chariot, drawn by <hi>Tritons,</hi>
and holding in the right hand his <hi>Trident,</hi> which at the three
points of it, caſt forth water to a greater height then the heigheſt
trees of the Garden. He is compaſſed about by a hundred <hi>Nereids</hi>
of Alablaſter, diſpoſed about the extremities of the Baſin, in a
hundred ſeveral poſtures; and placed at equal diſtances within a
row of Pilaſters of white marble, by which it is encompaſſed.
From this place, by the means of twelve ſpacious walks, which
abutt there, may be ſeen all the extremities of the Garden, and
the end of every walk is remarkable for ſome object that does a
certain pleaſant violence on the ſight, and ſurpaſſes the Spectator
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97242:29"/>
in twelve different manners. That particular walk into which we
were gotten, entertained our eyes onely with the gate of the
Garden, and a proſpect of <hi>Rome;</hi> but all the reſt end either with
perſpectives, made with ſo much art, that they deceave the ſight,
even to the extremity thereof; or with grotts, admirable as well
for the variety of ſhells, and the Nacre whereof they are built, as
for the diverſity of the ſprings and ſigures, whereby they are
adorned, or with Arbours miraculous for their ſtructure, or laſtly
with deſcents of water, ordered with ſuch extraordinary artifice,
as that falling from an exceſſive height upon a many ſeveral ſteps,
it makes a confuſed, but withal, a pleaſant noiſe, and ſo runs into
a number of little channels, which border the Walks in diverſe
places, croſſe them in divers others, ſo that people are forced to
go over them upon Bridges, having on both ſides Pilaſters of
Marble.</p>
                     <p>The twelve principal walks are croſſed up and down by an
infinite number of others, wherein it is not hard for one to loſe
himſelf; but with this advantage, by way of recompence, that
whereſoever chance, or your own, inclination diſpoſes of you, the
objects you are entertained with, are every where very delightful
and very ſurprizing. There are thouſands of rarities in this
Garden, which I do not trouble you with an account of, and for
what I have told, it hath onely been by the way, and ſomewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
my purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>When the whole Company had taken ſeveral turns about the
Baſin, it divided it ſelf into ſeveral parties according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
inclinations of the perſons, <hi>Julia</hi> having made a propoſition
to that purpoſe, and repreſented that walking wanted that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and divertiſement when there were a many together, which
it had when there is more privacy. For my part I was reſolved not
to leave <hi>Octavia,</hi> who began to direct her courſe towards one of
the principal Walks, and my Siſter <hi>Antonia</hi> was as reſolved to
keep me company. It was, I muſt confeſſe, no ſmal ſatisfaction
to me, that <hi>Druſus</hi> came and joyned with <hi>Tiberius,</hi> to lead me, as
well upon the account of the many excellent qualities I obſerved
in his perſon, as alſo that I thought it much better, being between
the Brothers, then alone with <hi>Tiberius;</hi> beſides that I cannot
deny, but that I found ſomething in <hi>Druſus</hi>'s diſcourſe, which in
ſome meaſure took off the teadiouſneſſe I met with in that of his
Brother, and conſequently was ſatisfied as to the good opinion
which all the World had of him. He was in very good terms
with <hi>Marcellus,</hi> as to the difference there had been between them
concerning their loves to <hi>Julia;</hi> inſomuch, that he not onely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore
all viſits to the Princeſſe, but it was viſible in all his actions,
that he had given over all thoughts of her, and ſought nothing
with ſo much earneſtneſſe as the friendſhip of <hi>Marcellus.</hi> Beſides,
though he ſided as much as he could with his Brother, as in point
of honour he was obliged to do, yet did he not preſſe his intereſt
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:97242:30"/>
very much to me, and knowing the averſion I had for his Brothers
addreſſes, and the reſpects I had for thoſe of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> he ſaid
very little to me of his Brother, and ſpoke nothing to the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of his Rival. 'Twas this day that he entertained me
with abundance of things that were infinitely pleaſant, and his
Brother maliciouſly putting him upon ſome diſcourſe concerning
<hi>Julia,</hi> he ſpoke of her with ſo much modeſty and reſervedneſſe,
but withal with ſo much wit, that I had from that time a greater
eſteem for him then I had had before.</p>
                     <p>After us came <hi>Antonia,</hi> led by <hi>Archelaus</hi> and <hi>Mithridates,</hi> but
the Emperour having ſent for <hi>Archelaus,</hi> as having ſome buſineſſe
to communicate to him, <hi>Mithridates</hi> ſtayed alone with <hi>Antonia,</hi>
to his unconceaveable ſatisfaction. This was it he had ſought out
of a long time, and what he could never find before; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
being a perſon infinitely confident, he would needs make
his advantage of it, attributing the ſilence he had for ſome time
obſerved to want of opportunity. And yet all his confidence,
though ſommoned together upon this occaſion, ſtuck not ſo cloſe
to him, but that for ſome minutes he was at a loſſe what to do as
to the deſign he had to diſcover his thoughts, and <hi>Antonia</hi> on the
other ſide was ſo terrible upon any occaſions of that nature, that
ſhe was able to make the moſt aſſured of their ſtrength to tremble.
However he took heart in his reſolution, and falling into diſcourſe
about the departure of <hi>Archelaus; I never made it any queſtion,
Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>but that</hi> Archelaus <hi>entertains whatever
orders come from</hi> Caeſar, <hi>with all the reſpect and complyance that
may be; but for this laſt, I believe it hath been receaved by him, with
a diſturbance equal to the ſatisfaction it hath bred in me.</hi> I <hi>cannot
apprehend,</hi> replies Antonia, <hi>the cauſe of either his diſcontent or your
joy, nor ſee in this accident any occaſion of either the one or the
other. For</hi> Archelaus, replies Mithridates, <hi>you cannot certainly
but know how unkindly he takes it to be abſent from you, ſince you
are not to be now acquainted with the paſſion he hath for you: and
for</hi> Mithridates, <hi>you may well imagine what joy it is to him to have
the honour to waite on you alone, when I have once told you that he is
involved in the ſame chains with</hi> Archelaus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Theſe words of</hi> Mithridates <hi>made</hi> Antonia <hi>bluſh for very indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
though from ſome circumſtances ſhe was ſatisfied as to ſome
part of that truth; but ſhe would needs pretend that ſhe
underſtood not his meaning, and ſo ſeem the leſſe incenſed
againſt him, whereupon re-aſſuming the diſcourſe with an action
full of diſdain,</hi> I know not, <hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> what you mean either
by the <hi>chains</hi> or <hi>paſſions</hi> of <hi>Archelaus,</hi> but am ſatisfied, that were
he conſcious of any thing which I ſhould take amiſſe at his hands,
the reſpects he hath for me are ſo great, that he would keep it from
my knowledge. Ah Madam, <hi>replyed he,</hi> is it poſſible, that you who
pretend ſo much to a real ſincerity, can ſo peremptorily affirm that
the King of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> hath never entertained you with the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:97242:30"/>
affection he hath for you? If ever he did ſpeak to me of it, <hi>replies
the Princeſſe,</hi> it matters not, I gave no credit to what he ſaid, and
that for me to do ſo, was the greateſt advantage he could ever hope
from ſuch diſcourſe; for after all, when he had done what he could
to perſwade me that he had an affection for me, I ſhould poſſibly have
perſwaded him in my turn, that I ſhould be ſubject to a quite contrary
paſſion for perſons, whoſe affections make them forget the reſpect they
ought to obſerve. For matter of reſpect, <hi>replies the Prince of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magenes,</hi>
I muſt acknowledge, it ought to be had for you while life
laſts, and that the leaſt violation thereof deſerves the ſevereſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment;
but for a man to be ſo far from being awanting in point
of reſpect, as that he onely preſumes to diſcover a love, which for the
greateſt part conſiſts in reſpect it ſelf; does he deſerve thoſe light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
and thunder-bolts which you caſt at the guilty? and muſt a
man needs be expoſed to your indignation for telling you, that he
hath an adoration for you, equal to what he hath for the gods, as he
ſhould be to that of another perſon, whom he had done ſome affront
to? The caſe is the very ſame, <hi>replies the Princeſſe very roundly,</hi>
and in my opinion, there ſhould be no diſtinction made between ſuch
adorations and affronts. How Madam, <hi>cries out Mithridates,</hi> it
ſeems you allow no difference between the effects of Love, and thoſe
of Hatred? When thoſe of Love are importunate and troubleſome,
<hi>anſwers Antonia,</hi> I think them more inſupportable then thoſe of
Hatred, and, ſuch is my humour, I ſhould ſooner pardon an affect of
Hatred in my enemies, then an expreſſion of Love in thoſe that call
themſelves my Friends. Ah Madam, <hi>replies the Prince with an
action full of earneſtneſſe,</hi> if it be ſo, I ſhall adviſe the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<hi>Mithridates</hi> not to tell you till at the laſt gaſp, that he dies for
you, and I ſhall beſeech you for the future to read in his eyes what you
forbid him to declare with his tongue.</p>
                     <p>Mithridates <hi>had no ſooner pronounced theſe words, with a
ſubmiſſive look on the ground, but</hi> Antonia <hi>caſting her eyes on
him, with an action full of fierceneſſe;</hi> Mithridates, <hi>ſaid ſhe to
him,</hi> I am now ſatisfied that you take me for ... <hi>at which word
making a ſudden ſtop, haply to correct what the haſtineſſe of her
thoughts had almoſt forced into her mouth.</hi> No, no, <hi>ſaid the
Prince, interrupting her,</hi> no Madam, I do not take you for <hi>Julia,</hi>
for it was of her that you were going to ſpeak, and the gods are my
witneſſes, that though truth it ſelf, and the paſſion I have had for
that Princeſſe, might well oblige me to ſpeak advantageouſly of her,
yet muſt I acknowledge that I find no reſemblance between you. It was
from my intention, <hi>replies Antonia,</hi> to ſay any thing of <hi>Julia,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave
it an honour to be any way like her, and am perſwaded ſhe gives
as little entertainment as I do, to ſuch diſcourſes as that, you have
entertained me with: but whether that be ſo or not, if I have deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
this unhappy adventure for the pains I have taken to make you
ſome anſwer on an unbeſeeming ſubject, meerly to avoid the like for
the future, ſince I cannot take down your confidence, I ſhall deprive
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97242:31"/>
you of the occaſions, and you ſhall talk to me in another ſtile, or never
ſee me again.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mithridates</hi> at theſe words, notwithſtanding his great confidence
was ſomewhat at a loſſe, and knew not what anſwer to make her,
when the incenſed <hi>Antonia</hi> having pronounced them; and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a little faſter to overtake us, <hi>Siſter, Siſter, ſaid ſhe to me, ſtay
for us, and give us leave to be of your company, and participate of
your diſcourſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe words falling from her ſomewhat diſorderedly, were
enough for me to gueſſe at the truth; ſo that when ſhe was come
up to us, I could not forbear looking on her with a certain ſmile, as
if I underſtood by her countenance that ſhe was really angry.
Coming to our ſide, <hi>Druſus,</hi> who was next her, very reſpectfully
preſented her with the hand he had at liberty, and <hi>Antonia</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
with as much civility receaved it, we walked all five abreſt,
after <hi>Octavia</hi> and <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> who were ſome few paces before us,
and often engaged in our diſcourſe. <hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Druſus</hi> talked
in a manner all the time, and though <hi>Mithridates</hi> was a perſon
ſufficiently inclined to diſcourſe and mirth, yet came there not
many words from him all the day after. I could not forbear ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
when ever I looked on <hi>Antonia,</hi> who was extreamly troubled
at it. But what was moſt pleaſant of all, was, when we were got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
out of the ſpacious walk to go into others that were narrower,
which lye next to the little Rivuletts, and wherein there cannot
walk above three abreſt; for <hi>Druſus</hi> being in the middle of the
five, and juſt between my Siſter and me, we were both deſirous to
keep him; <hi>Antonia,</hi> to be exempted from the diſcourſe ſhe was
ſo willing to avoid, and I, becauſe I would not be alone with
<hi>Tiberius,</hi> and accordingly upon theſe ſeveral conſiderations we
both drew <hi>Druſus</hi> with us at the ſame time, and to make him the
more ſure to us, wrung him hard by the hand.</p>
                     <p>That action ſurprized him a little at firſt, as not being wont to be
ſo treated by us, but a while after, being a perſon infinitely ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
he apprehended our meaning, and could not forbear laughing
at it. He was a while in ſuſpence which ſide to take, telling us
that he wiſhed himſelf the fate of <hi>Ariſtocles,</hi> with abundance of
other things, very witty and pleaſant; but at laſt, he decided the
controverſie, ſomewhat to my diſadvantage, for he left me, becauſe
he would be alone with <hi>Antonia,</hi> but telling me withal very wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
that he was a better Brother then for to deprive <hi>Tiberius</hi> any
longer of my diſcourſe, and that he would waite upon <hi>Antonia,</hi>
who had not the ſame engagements to <hi>Mithridates,</hi> as I had to his
Brother. <hi>Mithridates</hi> bluſhed at this diſcourſe, and was forced,
though with much diſcontent, to accept of <hi>Druſus</hi>'s company: but
not long after, being come to a place where ſeveral walks croſſed
one the other, we met <hi>Julia, Agrippina,</hi> and <hi>Marcia,</hi> with <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,
Domitius, Craſſus,</hi> and young <hi>Ptolomey</hi> our Brother, and ſaw
coming on the other ſide, the <hi>Emperour</hi> with <hi>Terentia,</hi> the Empreſs,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:97242:31"/>
                        <hi>Marcella</hi> and divers others, ſo that <hi>Caeſar</hi> having given order that
all the Company ſhould rally, all met together at the end of one
of the walks in a ſpacious vaulted Arbour, open on three ſides,
and having at the three openings, three ſprings caſting up water
higher than the roof of the Arbour. There it was that the
Muſick expected us, and that the moſt excellent voices that <hi>Rome</hi>
could afford, joyned to all the inſtruments requiſite to make a
noble conſort, gave us a very delightful divertiſment. After the
Muſick, which laſted not above an houre, all went a walking again,
and walked till night; but this ſecond time, every one endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to avoid being of their Company whom they could not affect,
ſo that <hi>Mithridates</hi> being deprived of the company of <hi>Antonia,</hi>
who did all ſhe could to ſhun him, ſtayed with <hi>Druſus, Craſſus,</hi> young
<hi>Ptolomey,</hi> and others, who came not neer the Ladies for all that day.</p>
                     <p>When the day began to diſ-lodge, and reſign its place to dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
we were all brought into a ſpacious Bower, ſo covered over
with the boughs of trees whereof it was made that the violent
rayes of the Meridian Sun could hardly find any paſſage into it,
but that night it had ſuch an exceſſe of light, that it might be ſaid
it never knew a greater day, that is, that of a thouſand torches
faſtened to a hundred ſumptuous branches ſparkling with gold and
precious ſtones, which hanging down from the boughs of the
Bower, produced the nobleſt effect in the World, and enlightned
a magnificent Theatre that had been ſet up at one end of it, and
upon which the ſucceſſors of the famous <hi>Roſcius</hi> entertained the
Company for two hours.</p>
                     <p>The Comedy being ended, we went into another Bower, not
far from the former, and enlightned after the ſame manner, where
we were entertained with a magnificent collation; and that alſo
over, the reſt of the night was ſpent in dancing. <hi>Archelaus</hi> danced
with <hi>Antonia,</hi> whom <hi>Mithridates</hi> durſt not come neer all the night.
<hi>Polemon</hi> danced with <hi>Marcella,</hi> and had a long diſcourſe with
her, and our Brother <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> with the fair <hi>Martia;</hi> but after
a manner much different from that of the other. For <hi>Polemon</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an extraordinary paſſion for <hi>Marcella,</hi> who for her part was
not any way moved thereat, and did not much mind the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Polemon</hi>'s affection, and <hi>Ptolomey</hi> naturally averſe from love,
unleſſe it were that of his liberty, was little moved at the beauty
of <hi>Martia,</hi> though ſhe were ſo well furniſhed that way as to make
an impreſſion on ſouls that were moſt inſenſible, and had naturally
no averſion for <hi>Ptolemey,</hi> but lived with him by the directions of
<hi>Octavia,</hi> as if they had been Brother and Siſter. For <hi>Domitius</hi> and
<hi>Agrippina,</hi> their converſation was ful of freedom, and whereas the
pretentions of <hi>Domitius</hi> were generally countenanced and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and <hi>Agrippina</hi> a perſon of a diſpoſition eaſily ſatisfied, her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
accordingly met with few traverſes of fortune, and ſo her mind
had little to ſtruggle withal. <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Julia</hi> were in the
height of familiarity, in regard no man diſputed her with him,
and that he himſelf had made his peace with her, as to the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97242:32"/>
difference they had had together about the love of <hi>Druſus;</hi> and
for my part, I had my hands full of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who made all the
advantage he could of the abſence of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> but the moſt
pleaſant part of the ſtory was a diſpute raiſed by <hi>Cypaſſis,</hi> between
<hi>Ovid</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> who had waited on her all that day, and who,
upon a very nice and tickliſh queſtion, ſaid things worthy the
admiration of all the World. The greateſt part of the night
being thus ſpent, it was thought time to retire, whereupon the
whole Company being diſpoſed into Chariots, every one went to,
what was then moſt deſirable, reſt.</p>
                     <p>I know Siſter I have not done well thus to digreſſe, or at leaſt
there was no neceſſity I ſhould give you ſuch a particular deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that dayes walking and entertainments, and it is not
unlikely you expected to hear of ſome extraordinary accident
ſome way relating to this Hiſtory. But this ſhort relation of the
divertiſements of that day, (whereof I have given as brief an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
as I could) may be thus far advantageous to you, as to make
you better acquainted, as well with the perſons, as the little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues
that then were in the Court of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and I have been
ſo much the larger out of this conſideration, that it was this day
that gave birth to ſome things which have ſince come to paſſe of
very great conſequence. My Siſter <hi>Antonia</hi> and I had layn together
for ſome few dayes before, and were extraordinary kind one to
another, as being engaged in a friendſhip that allowed as little ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
as could poſſibly be. As we were undreſſing our ſelves
that night, I fell into diſcourſe about what had happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
her and <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and though ſhe was extreamly loth
to make me acquainted with it, yet at laſt not able to ſtand out
againſt my perſecutions of her, ſhe gave me a punctual account of
all the diſcourſe ſhe had had with him, as I have related it to you
already, and diſcovered ſo much indignation in the recital thereof,
that notwithſtanding the ſadneſſe which then lay heavy on my
heart, I could not forbear laughing at it, and to torment her with
diſcourſe about it. But the occaſion I laid hold of to do ſo, was
yet more handſome, when, as ſhe put off her cloaths, there fell,
out of one of her ſleeves, a letter that had been hidden there,
and which was no ſooner fallen to the ground, but I took it up,
and having with a great curioſity looked on the ſuperſcription,
I found written in a hand that was unknown to me. (<hi>To the fair</hi>
Antonia.) I had no ſooner eyed that ſuperſcription, but preſenting
it to her, and obliging her to read it, ſhe was extreamly at a loſſe,
and perceaving her amazement to be ſo great as hindred her from
ſpeaking, <hi>Siſter,</hi> ſaid I to her, <hi>you have not dealt freely with me,
ſince that having acquainted me with the particularities of</hi> Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates'<hi>s
affection, you conceal from me that of another more forunate
Servant of yours, from whom you receave letters.</hi> Theſe words
put her into a ſudden bluſh; but having ſoon after recovered her
ſelf, <hi>Siſter,</hi> replyed ſhe very ſoberly, <hi>I ſhall not vindicate my ſelf
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:97242:32"/>
to you, and I think you know me better then to believe that I receave
letters from any one. And yet you ſee,</hi> replyed I, <hi>that this is very
truely directed to you, and that he that writ it, hath been ſo much
afraid it ſhould miſcarry, that he would needs put your name in the
ſuperſcription in very fair Characters. For that,</hi> replies Antonia,
<hi>be it on the account of his diſcretion; but that he hath been ſo
fortunate in his deſign, as that it ſhould be known it was directed to
me, is all the ſatisfaction it will bring him, and aſſure your ſelf, I
am ſatisfied with the bare ſuperſcription, and have no deſire to ſee
any more of it. Not but that I am perſwaded it comes from</hi> Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates
<hi>himſelf, who will needs accompliſh what he ſo confidently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
It being not ſo likely that</hi> Archelaus <hi>ſhould have any hand in it,
ſince he talked with me all the evening, and that I cannot believe
every day ſhould produce perſons guilty of ſuch an exceſſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.
However it may be,</hi> ſaid I to her, <hi>if you are not reſolved
to conceal it from me, you will give me leave to read it. You may
as well let it alone,</hi> replies Antonia, <hi>but it would argue in me a
diſtruſt of my own ſtrength, ſhould I forbid you to do it if you are
ſo reſolved. I therefore opened the letter, and began to read aloud
theſe words.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Since that in your judgement there is no diſtinction to
be made between adorations and affronts, and that you
think the effects of hatred more ſupportable than thoſe of
love.</p>
                     <p>Now, Siſter, <hi>ſaies Antonia, interrupting me,</hi> was I not in the
right, when I told you it came from <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and are they not
his own words in the diſcourſe that paſt between us? So far, <hi>ſaid I
to her,</hi> I agree with you that <hi>Mithridates</hi> is the Authour of it; but
let us ſee what follows, and comfort your ſelf ſo far, as that there is
no new affront offered you in this letter, ſince it acquaints you with
nothing but what you knew before. <hi>Antonia</hi> being of the ſame
opinion, heard me with much more quietneſſe of thought then before,
ſo that I began it again, and found it in theſe words.</p>
                     <p>SInce that in your judgement there is no diſtinction to be made
between adorations and affronts, and that you think the effects of
<hi>Hatred</hi> more ſupportable than thoſe of <hi>Love,</hi> thoſe who are deſtind
to affront you, ſince they are onely ſuch as are born to adore you,
ought either to conceale the offence from you, or keep the offender
out of your knowledge. For my part, faireſt <hi>Antonia,</hi> I am the
greateſt of your <hi>Enemies,</hi> ſince that I am of all mankind the perſon
that hath the greateſt <hi>affection</hi> for you, and I tell you that confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which I ſhould not without trembling, were I not unknown to you.
You have ſeen and known the <hi>perſon,</hi> while yet you were ignorant of
his <hi>paſſion;</hi> but now that the <hi>paſſion</hi> is diſcovered, it is but fit the
<hi>perſon</hi> ſhould be concealed, that onely his <hi>Love</hi> may be expoſed to
your indignation. And ſince it is onely Love that you hate, and not
the perſons that are inclined to love you, if it be poſſible to engage
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97242:33"/>
the averſion you have for it, with ſuch good ſucceſſe as that you may
be entreated to be more favourable to it, thoſe who are guilty of no
other crime, will appear before you in a leſſe odious poſture, when
their crime is pardoned, or at leaſt connived at by your indulgence.
The moſt guilty of all thoſe that commit any offences of this nature
againſt you, ſeeing himſelf reduced by your inflexible maximes, to
a cruel neceſſity of either holding his peace, or concealing himſelf,
ſtands in ſuſpence at the choice he is to make, which though it be, in
appearance, fantaſtick, yet is in its conſequences rational enough,
nay haply generous enough, ſince that he cannot be charged with any
conſideration of his perſon, but onely of his love, and that it is to
induce you to bear with his Love, that he addreſſes himſelf to you,
and not to engage you to any affection towards his <hi>perſon,</hi> which he
conceals from you, and which he ſhall conceal, haply, as long as belives.
Pardon him this innocent ſurprize, which he intends your rigour,
and let onely your Beauty engage againſt him, in a caſe wherein,
to puniſh the raſhneſſe of his attempt, it wants not the aſſiſtance of
your cruelty.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as I had given over reading, I looked on <hi>Antonia,</hi> who
at the ſame time caſt her eyes on my face, with certain diſcoveries
of aſtoniſhment, not inferiour to what I was in my ſelf. In a word,
we were both equally ſurpriſed, and whereas we inferred from
the firſt words of the Letter, that it came from <hi>Mithridates,</hi> we
concluded from the ſequele, not onely the quite contrary, but
were perſwaded withall, that the perſon who had writ it, had
never made any expreſſion of his love to <hi>Antonia,</hi> and that in that
Letter he took occaſion to make the firſt diſcoveries of it. 'Tis
true we were ſomewhat diſtruſtful as to that opinion, when we
reflected on the firſt words, which were the ſame ſhe had ſaid to
<hi>Mithridates,</hi> and could not apprehend how they could come by
chance ſo pat into the imagination of the Unknown Lover; but
for all the reſt, it had ſo little relation or conſiſtency either with
the humour, former proceeding of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> or the terms
wherein he was with <hi>Antonia,</hi> that we were ſatisfied it muſt needs
be ſome other, and that one that either out of curioſity or concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the buſineſſe, might have gotten behind the trees that
were on both ſides the walk, wherein the diſcourſe had paſt,
and liſtening attentively to what was ſaid, had heard ſome part
of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Being agreed in this opinion as the moſt probable, we fell into
diſcourſe upon the adventure; ſo far, that</hi> Antonia <hi>thought there
was ſome thing in it ſo full of ſurpriſe, and ſo extraordinary, that
ſhe could not be angry at it, as ſhe had been before at the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of</hi> Mithridates. <hi>We ſearched among all the men I have
named to you the perſon we could with any likelihood ſuſpect;
but though it was out of all queſtion that it was one of thoſe
that had paſſed the day with us, yet after we had examined them
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:97242:33"/>
all one after another, we could not faſten on any one whom we
could charge with it. Divers of them had come neer</hi> Antonia,
<hi>as well during the Comedy, as while they danced, and at the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
but of all thoſe that ſhe could remember had had any
diſcourſe with her, there was not any whom we knew not to be
otherwiſe engaged as to matter of affection, or to be much awant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in point of ingenuity, to carry on ſuch a piece of gallantry.
When we had diſcovered almoſt to wearineſſe about it;</hi> Who it
may be, it matters not, <hi>ſaies Antonia,</hi> he puts himſelf to a great
deal of trouble to no purpoſe, and if he deprive me of the object of
my indignation, by concealing his perſon from me, he alſo deprives
himſelf, <hi>continued ſhe laughing,</hi> of the acknowledgement I ſhould
return his affection by not diſcovering himſelf. Ah Siſter, <hi>ſaid I
to her,</hi> how well is this man acquainted with you, and how true is it,
that if you were as ready to make acknowledgements, as to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with indignation, he would have taken a courſe quite contrary
to what he hath; but, be he what he will, I do not onely think him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
ingenious, but I believe he may carry on his deſign very ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſefully,
and dare paſſe my word that you have a leſſe averſion for
him then for <hi>Mithridates</hi> and others, who have been ſo confident as
to diſcover their paſſions to you. I acknowledge no leſſe, <hi>replies
Antonia,</hi> and am of your mind, that if I never know him while I
live, I ſhall never while I live know whom I ought to hate. However
it may be, <hi>replyed I,</hi> tis out of all doubt, this man hath Vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and in that underſtanding ſomething that is great, and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
very viſibly that he is a perſon of eminent quality, we ſhall
know him when he ſhall think it fit. ... And, I hope, <hi>added Antonia,
interrupting me,</hi> that, if he be a man of his word, we ſhall never know
him. In troth, <hi>replyed I,</hi> my mind gives me, I ſhould be extreamly
troubled at it, and muſt confeſſe this untroden way of proceeding
hath raiſed in me a more than ordinary curioſity. <hi>We ſhould have
had abundance of other diſcourſe upon this adventure, but it
was ſo late, or rather ſo neer day, that we were loath to ſit up
any longer, ſo that going to bed a little after, we ſoon fell
aſleep.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For ſome dayes enſuing, (though it might well be thought,
that the misfortunes of my own life, being at that time ſuch as
found matter of diſcontent enough, ſhould have left me but little
curioſity) I made it my earneſt buſineſſe to find out whom that
Letter ſhould come from, nay ſeemed to be much more concerned
in the buſineſs than <hi>Antonia</hi> her ſelf, who looked on all theſe things
with the greateſt indifference imaginable. And what much
heightned my inquiſition, was, that me thought the adventure
argued ſomewhat ſo far beyond the ordinary way of proceeding,
that, contrary to my natural inclination, I was extreamly deſirous to
ſee the iſſue of it. But all the little inquiries I made, proved inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual,
for I never could come to the leaſt diſcovery of any thing;
with ſo great circumſpection had that perſon managed all things in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:97242:34"/>
order to the deſign he had to continue ſtill unknown, though he
omitted not any that might demonſtrate the earneſtneſſe of his
paſſion for <hi>Antonia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>Ptolomey</hi> our Brother, (the onely Brother For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
had left us after the loſſe of <hi>Alexander,</hi> who was gone to
find you out in <hi>Armenia,</hi> and of whom we had not the leaſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
in the World) lived in <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s Court, after ſuch a rate as
gave all that knew him occaſion to conceave very great hopes of
him: but as to matter of inclinations, the greateſt he ſeemed to
have, were thoſe of his Liberty, nay, though he daily waited on
the faireſt Ladies about <hi>Rome,</hi> and was extreamly well entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them, yet could it not be inferred from any action of his,
that he had a particular devotion for any. He was a great Lover
of Arms, Horſes, and all Exerciſes of the Body, and had a ſingular
dexterity therein; but, to ſigh or pine for a Beauty, was a thing
inconſiſtent with his humour, as being a perſon naturally inclined
to be free and cheerful, and avoided as much as could be all
diſtraction of thought. The vertuous <hi>Octavia,</hi> who ſtill perſiſted
in the generous deſign ſhe had taken to make the beſt proviſion ſhe
could for the children of <hi>Anthony,</hi> and imagined ſhe could not
do it any way better then by bringing them into the family and
allyance of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> being now out of all hopes to effect her deſires
firſt in the perſon of <hi>Julius Antonius,</hi> and not long ſince in that of
<hi>Alexander,</hi> who was looked on as loſt as well as our Elder Brother,
conceaved it might be brought to ſomething in <hi>Pt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>lomey,</hi> and
wiſhed his inclination directed <hi>to Martia,</hi> a Lady courted by the
greateſt perſons among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and, to ſpeak modeſtly of her,
one that had very excellent parts. <hi>Ptolomey</hi> made no difficulty,
to entertain that Princeſſe with all the civilities ſhe might expect
from him, nay, diſcovered ſomewhat of particular affection for
her, ſuitably to the good intentions of <hi>Octavia:</hi> but indeed his
flames were come to no great height, though <hi>Martia</hi> were a perſon
infinitely lovely, for having a freedom of acceſſe to her every
day, his deportment was accordingly full of cheerfullneſſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference.
It was much otherwiſe with <hi>Martia,</hi> and though ſhe
were of an exemplary vertue and modeſty, yet muſt it withal be
acknowledged, that ſhe is ſubjeſt to much tenderneſſe of mind, and
having been brought up with <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> as with a perſon on whom
her mother had caſt her eies with a deſign to make him her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and lived familiarly with him as with <hi>Marcellus,</hi> that frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
friendſhip, which, with the names of Brother and Siſter, <hi>Octavia</hi>
would needs have continued among us, had made a greater
impreſſion in her mind, then well ſtood with the ſerenity and quiet
thereof, ſo far as that ſhe was no longer able to withſtand the
lovely qualities of that Prince, which out of all doubt had
wrought much more upon her inclinations, than hers had upon
thoſe of <hi>Ptolomey.</hi> I had, not without much diſ-ſatisfaction,
taken notice of it my ſelf, and ſeveral times chid my Brother
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:97242:34"/>
for his backwardneſſe in his acknowledgements of the ſincere
affection of <hi>Martia:</hi> but the young man, of an uncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
humour, would make ſome ſhift to put me off, telling
me that he loved and honoured <hi>Martia,</hi> as he was obliged
to do, and that he ſhould be well content to give her the
greateſt aſſureances ſhe could expect of the devotion he had
for her; but for melancholy, diſturbances of mind, and
reſervedneſſe, he looked on them as the deſtroyers of his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and making good what he ſaid in his actions, he was indeed
very punctual in doing her all manner of civilities, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements,
nay ſo far as to expreſſe a more particular affection
for her, then for any other. Yet was it obſervable withal, that
it was done with a certain diſcovery of much freedom of mind,
which argued in him ſuch a mediocrity of inclinations, as that he
would not, to waite on her, abate any thing of his enjoyments,
nor let ſlip any occaſion that offered it ſelf to be among the Ladies,
whoſe company could afford him ought of diverſion. <hi>Martia,</hi>
who is of a very mild diſpoſition, endured this indifferent manner
of behaviour a long time, without the leaſt diſcovery of any
diſcontent thereat: but at laſt, looking on it as an evident expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his coldneſſe and negligence, ſhe began to be troubled,
inſomuch that the grief ſhe conceaved thereat, wrought ſome alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
both in her humour and countenance. All the World took
notice of her ſadneſſe; but the motive thereof was abſolutely
unknown, and <hi>Martia,</hi> who made it her buſineſſe to conceal it
what ſhe could, had haply ſmothered it to this day, if I had not
caſually made the firſt diſcovery thereof.</p>
                     <p>During the time that her melancholy grew more and more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
upon her, taking occaſion to give her a viſit, and finding
her alone, I entreated her of all love to acquaint me with the
cauſe of her ſadneſſe, which troubled not onely all that knew
her, but my ſelf more particularly, who (as I was for many conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
obliged to do) had a more than ordinary affection for
her. My careſſes were anſwered by <hi>Martia;</hi> after an indifferent
and evaſive manner, yet ſuch as betrayed much grief and reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Very loath ſhe ſeemed to be go give me any ſatisfactory
anſwer, and would ſay no more then that ſhe knew not any cauſe
whence her ſadneſſe ſhould proceed, and that it muſt be derived
from her temperament or ſome indiſpoſition of Body. But I, not
ſatisfied with this anſwer, reproached her with a want of ſincerity,
and was preſſing her to diſcover her mind more freely to a perſon
whom ſhe might truſt with any thing, when <hi>Ptolomey</hi> comes into
the Chamber. His firſt appearance wrought ſuch an alteration
in her, that her colour changed ſeveral times of a ſudden; and
having caſually caſt my eies on her countenance, I could not
but immediately take notice of the alteration which my Brothers
coming in had wrought therein. From this diſcovery I might
well gueſſe at ſome part of the buſineſſe, and was in a manner
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:97242:35"/>
perſwaded that <hi>Ptolomey</hi> had contributed much to the change of
that Princeſſe's diſpoſition.</p>
                     <p>This reflection made me take more particular notice of her
deportment then I had done before, and I obſerved, that while
<hi>Ptolomey</hi> ſtayed with us, ſhe was at ſuch a loſſe, that ſhe found it
ſome difficulty to ſpeak. His viſit was indeed but very ſhort, for
having ſtayed about a quarter of an hour with us, he told us,
we were too ſad for his company, and that he would go to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bina's,</hi>
where <hi>Virginia, Hortenſia, Telavia,</hi> and ſeveral other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
were met, and where he hoped to find more diverſion.
Whereupon going out of the room, he left <hi>Martia</hi> ſo much
troubled, both at his words, and manner of departure, that the
moſt diſ-obſervant perſon in the World might have perceaved
the diſturbance of her thoughts, by the trouble it raiſed in her
countenance. I muſt confeſſe I was my ſelf much ſurprized at
<hi>Ptolomey</hi>'s deportment, and angry with him for it, and having
withal obſerved <hi>Martia</hi>'s affliction thereat, I was ſo much the
more earneſt to look further into the buſineſſe, out of the deſires
I had to ſerve and oblige her, if it lay in my power. To which
effect reiterating the careſſes and intreaties I had made to her
ſome few minutes before, I conjured her by all the friendſhip that
was between us, not to conceale from me any longer what her
heart was ſo much burthened with, aſſuring her that that curioſity
in me proceeded not from any thing but the deſires I had to ſerve
her in that conjuncture, proportionably to the affection I had for
her. But I could not get a word from her, &amp; inſtead of ſome anſwer,
there fell from her eyes ſome few tears which ſhe could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
keep in any longer, and which ſhe would have concealed from
me by turning her head to the other ſide. That diſcovery raiſed
in me all the compaſſion I could conceave at ſuch an accident, and
thereupon putting my cheek to hers, with an action that argued
the tenderneſſe I had for her, <hi>What Siſter,</hi> ſaid I to her, <hi>can you
be ſo cruel as to conceale from me the cauſe of a grief wherein I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
my ſelf ſo much; or have I ſo poorly deſerved your affection,
that you have ſo little confidence of mine? I durſt truſt my life in
your hands,</hi> replies Martia, <hi>nay any thing elſe that I thought more
precious; But why will you engage me into a diſcourſe, whence you
will infer nothing but my foudneſſe and extravagance? Or if you
have any opinion of my prudence, why will you not rather adviſe me
to do all that lies in my power to preſerve it? I am ſo well ſatisfied
as to that particular,</hi> replyed I, <hi>that I ſhall never conceave other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
of you; and that is the reaſon I am ſo importunate with you,
as knowing, that I ſhall not underſtand any thing from you, which
muſt not confirm me in the confidence I have thereof. It argues
the greatneſſe of my obligations to you,</hi> replyed the Princeſſe, <hi>but
be what will the iſſue of it, I cannot have the courage to acquaint
you with my weakneſſe, and I think I ſatisfie the duty of our mutual
friendſhip when I promiſe you to acknowledge it, if you gueſſe the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:97242:35"/>
cauſe thereof. Since you afford me that freedom,</hi> ſaid I to her, <hi>and
conſequently give me ſome ground to believe you will approve that of
my diſcourſe, may I not ask you, whether the young Prince, who
now left the room, be not in ſome meaſure the occaſion of
your melancholy, and whether his being awanting in the ſervice
he owes you may be ſome cauſe of your being diſſatisfied with
him?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Upon theſe words,</hi> Martia, <hi>being not any longer able to ſmother
the confuſion ſhe was in, nor the bluſhes that ſpread through her
countenance, leaned her ſelf againſt my ſhoulder, and wringing
one of my hands between both her own, with the greateſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of paſſion that could be,</hi> Siſter, <hi>ſaid ſhe to me, with much
difficulty,</hi> I am not worthy the ſervices of <hi>Ptolomey;</hi> nay it is not
unlikely he conceaves it ſo, and by his deportment towards me, you
may eaſily judge, that I am not to ſtatter my ſelf with any great
hopes of him. I muſt confeſſe that, having entertained the firſt
addreſſes of his affection, by the commands of thoſe who have the
diſpoſal of my inclinations, and that having poſſibly been too im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely
dutiful to <hi>Octavia,</hi> I cannot quit the hopes I had conceaved
thereof, without ſome affliction; and this is the confuſion, this is
the fondneſſe, which I neither durſt, nor ought to have diſcovered,
but the relyance I have on your friendſhip perſwades me, that you will
not let it go any further, nay, that you will conceale it even from
<hi>Ptolomey</hi> himſelf, who obliges me not to this tenderneſſe for him, while

                        <hi>Theſe words, falling from her with that mildneſſe which is
abſolutely natural in her, gave my heart a more then ordinary

                        </gap>iinitely beyond his
deſerts, if I may meaſure his happineſſe by theſe diſcoveries of your
affection towards him; nay I am confident, that had be but the
knowledge thereof, he would caſt himſelf at your feet, begging your
pardon for all the faults, which through the inconſiderate ſallies of
youth, he may have committed againſt you. He were unworthy all
countenance of fortune, if he entertain not this as the greateſt which
Heaven could favour him with; but I am to aſſure you, as I have had
it thouſands of times from his own mouth, and ſee it in his heart,
that he hath for you the greateſt ſentiments of paſſion and reſpect he
can have, and if that be awanting in the demonſtrations he ought to
give you thereof, it is to be attributed to the impetuoſity of his greener
years, which time will ſo ſettle, as that you will be the onely object
of his devotions for all the reſt of his life. <hi>I</hi> ſhall not acquaint him
with any thing of what you have diſcovered to me, but as from my
ſelf make him ſenſible of his omiſſions of duty, and <hi>I</hi> dare promiſe
you to bring him at your feet, as penitent, and as reformed in matter
of inclination as he ought to be, and your vertue deſerves. <hi>With
theſe words, and what elſe I ſaid to her, I appeaſed</hi> Martia, <hi>and
further repreſenting to her, that</hi> Ptolomey <hi>deſerved not ſo great</hi>
                        <pb n="66" facs="tcp:97242:36"/>
expreſſions of her good will, and that it was but oitting he ſhould
not be acquainted therewith, leaſt it made him too inſolent, I by
degrees ſo laid that mild nature, that I brought her to a reſolution
of not grieving any longer after that manner, and that ſhe would
reaſſume her former freedom and pleaſantneſſe of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, give me leave to acquaint you with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
which the ſame day happened to <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> and prepare
your ſelf to hear a very ſtrange accident. He went to <hi>Sabina's,</hi>
as he told us he would, where a great many Ladies met, and among
others, beſides thoſe he had named to us, <hi>Helvidia, Sulpicia,
Emilia,</hi> (whom I made mention of in the adventures of <hi>Julius
Antonius,</hi> &amp; who was ſome years ſince married to <hi>Scipio</hi>) and with
her that inexorable <hi>Tullia,</hi> who had been the cauſe of the loſſe of
our Elder Brother. After the death of <hi>Caecinna,</hi> and the deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
accident I have already related to you, ſhe retired to <hi>Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum,</hi>
where ſhe continued ſix years, without ever coming once
to <hi>Rome;</hi> during which time <hi>Cicero,</hi> her Brother, had made his
abode in <hi>Africk,</hi> where he was <hi>Proconſul;</hi> but being not long
before returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> he had brought his Siſter with him,
which to effect he had uſed all the authority he had over her,
otherwiſe ſhe had ſtill continued her ſolitude. 'Twas not above
three dayes before that ſhe came to <hi>Rome,</hi> where ſhe was thought as
beautiful as when ſhe left it, though ſhe were then about three or
four and twenty years of age, and had a ſufficient meaſure of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to cauſe ſome alteration in her beauty. Her dreſſe was not after
the exactneſſe of the mode, yet neat, and there was in her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
ſuch a conjunction of ſweetneſſe and majeſty, that <hi>Ptolomey,</hi>
who had never ſeen her before, immediately took notice of her
more than of any of the reſt. At his coming in, the company
was gotten into a long Gallery, where they were looking on the
pieces that were hanged about it, yet ſo as they were divided into
parties, according to the difference of pictures more or leſſe invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them. <hi>Ptolomey</hi> was not expected in this company, and if <hi>Sabina</hi>
had had any notice of his coming, ſhe would not have had <hi>Tullia</hi>
there, though ſhe were of her moſt intimate acquaintances: but
he being of a quality that won him a welcom reception every
where, and that the excellencies of his perſon recommended him
no leſſe then the rank he was of, he was very kindly entertained,
ſo far as that ſome part of the company came about him at his
entrance into the room. Being a perſon of a majeſtick look, a noble
carriage of body, and a deportment infinitely taking, <hi>Tullia</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
obſerved him, not without ſurpriſe, and ſhe viewed him
with ſuch a look as diſcovered, that, notwithſtanding his being
<hi>Anthony</hi>'s Son, he ſeemed ſuch to her, as could not raiſe her aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
Now ſhe being the onely perſon in the company to whom
he was unknown, ſhe aſked one that ſtood next her, what his name
was; which ſhe had no ſooner heard, but there riſe ſuch a tempeſt
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:97242:36"/>
in her countenance, that the alteration happened therein was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by all thoſe that looked on her. She was once in a thought
to leave the company, whereupon coming up to <hi>Emilia,</hi> and whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering
her in the ear with ſome diſturbance, <hi>What,</hi> ſaid ſhe to her,
<hi>can the World afford me no place of refuge againſt the Children of</hi>
Anthony? <hi>Emilia,</hi> who was troubled at the accident, made her
no immediate anſwer; but <hi>Sabina,</hi> as Lady of the Houſe, coming
neer her to make excuſes for what was happened, and to let her
know that ſhe was as much ſurprized at <hi>Ptolomey</hi>'s arrival, as ſhe
was, told her withal, that he was a perſon of ſuch quality, as not
to be forced out of the houſe. Whereupon <hi>Emilia,</hi> having ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
recovered her ſelf, intreated her not to make any diſturbance
in the company, and to remember her ſelf, that the two publick
diſcoveries ſhe had made of her averſion for the children of
<hi>Anthony</hi> had produced effects but too too deplorable; that ſhe
might ſtay in the room, yet not engage her ſelf into any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
converſation with <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> and from that day avoid all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
of meeting with him; that ſhe would undertake, that
<hi>Ptolomey</hi> ſhould not endeavour any acquaintance with her, and
that ſhe knew ſo much of his humour, as raiſed in her a confidence
that he would not be guilty of thoſe importunities towards her,
which his Brother had been. <hi>Sabina</hi> added her intreaties to
thoſe of <hi>Emilia,</hi> and both together prevailed ſo far with
<hi>Tullia,</hi> that they perſwaded her to ſtay with them as long as the
reſt did.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> who, upon the firſt ſight, had taken
notice of <hi>Tullia's</hi> beauty, and had further obſerved ſome part of
the trouble which his preſence had raiſed in her, and ſome thing
of what had paſſed in that part of the Gallery where ſhe had
retired, being in ſome impatience to know the name of that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
perſon, asked it of <hi>Albinus,</hi> who, making no difficulty, to
give him an account of her, filled him with aſtoniſhment. He
retreated ſome few paces, as ſomewhat amazed, and looking on
her more attentively than before; <hi>What,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>is this the ſame
inexorable</hi> Tullia, <hi>that terrible Beauty, by whoſe means we have loſt
our Brother?</hi> At theſe words he ſtopped, running over in his mind
thouſands of things which preſented themſelves confuſedly to his
imagination. The relation had been made of the inſupportable
treatments which our Brother had receaved from her, and the
ſad effects they had produced, raiſed in him ſuch bitter reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
againſt her, as made him abhor her as an over-cruel enemy;
And though he were not ignorant of the reaſon ſhe had to defie
all communication with our houſe, yet was it his judgement, as
well as of a many others, that ſhe was exceſſively violent againſt a
Prince, that had given her ſo great aſſurances of his love, and who,
as to his perſon, was very amiable and much reſpected. He had
often wiſhed a meeting with her, to ſee, as he would ſay himſelf,
what making that terrible perſon was of, and to try, whether his
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:97242:37"/>
ſoul were ſo immalleable, and conſequently not able to reſiſt the
influences of her beauty better then that of <hi>Julius Antonius</hi> did.
But <hi>Tullia</hi> being not returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> and that there was no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of her coming thither, he had quitted all hopes of it,
nay, loſt all remembrance of her. At laſt, having recovered himſelf
out of the firſt aſtoniſhment he had conceaved at the rencounter,
he fortified his heart with more fierceneſſe then ordinary, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning
all his indignation, to avoid a fate like that of his Brothers.
But he ſtood not in any need of that aſſiſtance, for, whether it
proceeded from the prejudice he had againſt her, or from a certain
Antipathy: he was not guilty of the leaſt inclination for her, and
accordingly looking on her with a ſcornful ſmile; <hi>Arme thy ſelf,</hi>
ſaid he to himſelf, <hi>with all the charms of imperious beauty, thou
ſhalt not treat me as thou didſt my Brother.</hi> He was at firſt in a
mind to be gone, as being unwilling that his preſence ſhould cauſe
any diſtraction in a company whereto he had not any invitation;
but not long after perceaving, that all were ſatisfied with his being
there, and that <hi>Sabina</hi> her ſelf was not troubled at it, he reſolved
to ſtay, as thinking it no diſcretion to deprive himſelf of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments,
to do the enemy of our houſe a pleaſure, and being not
much troubled at the ſpight he thought he did her by his
ſtay.</p>
                     <p>Being a perſon infinitely maſter of himſelf, he immediately
reaſſumed his ordinary pleaſantneſſe, and while the converſation
laſted, there fell from him the moſt ingenious things he had ſaid
in his life, and that with ſuch a grace, that all the company admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him. Even <hi>Tullia</hi> her ſelf was as attentive as any, could not
forbear looking on him, and found, to her grief, that her indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was not ſo violent, as ſhe had wiſhed it might have been. They
ſpent the time in ſeveral recreations, they danced, they had a collati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and as <hi>Ptolomey</hi> was the moſt ſportive, the moſt pleaſant, and, out
of all doubt, the handſomeſt perſon in the company, ſo did he
accordingly, in the dancing, and all the other entertainments,
draw the eyes and ears of the preſence after him. He ſung, he
danced with abundance of grace, nay, he would needs that day
make the greateſt oſtentation he could of himſelf, purpoſely to
put his enemy out of countenance, and to let her know that the
children of <hi>Anthony,</hi> were not ſo contemptible as ſhe would by
her example have perſwaded the World. His intention as to ſome
part proved effectual, as to the reſt, it produced effects much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from thoſe which he expected it ſhould. He ſpoke to all
the Ladies that were preſent, ſeveral times, <hi>Tullia</hi> onely excepted,
whom yet he treated not with any incivility, or did any action
that might diſoblige her, as well out of a reſpect for her ſex, as
upon <hi>Sabina's</hi> account, thinking it enough to be at ſome diſtance
from her, as it were to make ſhew of reſpect, and the fear he was
in to diſpleaſe her. He looked on her often, and he obſerved her
eyes were in a manner alwayes faſtened on his countenance. He
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:97242:37"/>
at firſt conceaved her looks to be ſuch as proceeded from indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but afterwards he was ſatisfied there was nothing of hoſtility in
them, and that her eyes darted no more rigour on him, then any
other of the company. That obſervation made him the more
ſelf-conceited<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inſomuch, that having that day reſolved to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
even to a degree of inſolence, whiſpering <hi>Lentulus,</hi> who
ſtood by him, in the ear, yet without turning his eyes towards
<hi>Tullia,</hi> whom he would by no means offend; <hi>Pray give me your
opinion,</hi> ſaid he to him, with a pleaſant kind of preſumption, <hi>do
not you perceave, that that cruel enemy of ours, who treated our elder
Brother with ſuch rigour, honours us with her looks? I have taken
notice of it, as well as your ſelf,</hi> ſaies Lentulus to him, <hi>and you
would think it very ſtrange, if, inſtead of the averſion ſhe hath for
your houſe, ſhe ſhould have a contrary paſſion for you. I ſhould indeed
be extreamly aſtoniſhed at it,</hi> replies Ptolomey, <hi>but if it ſhould be
the pleaſure of the gods that ſuch a thing ſhould come to paſſe, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
to you I ſhould revenge my Brother. How,</hi> added Lentulus,
taking him to the window, that they might not be heard, <hi>you
would behave your ſelf barbarouſly and inflexibly towards a Beauty
that had an affection for you, and would act the part of</hi> Tullia <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her, if ſhe acted towards you that of</hi> Julius Antonius? <hi>I have
not hitherto,</hi> replyed my Brother, <hi>been any wayes in a condition
to exerciſe my cruelty, and when things ſhall come to the paſſe that
you ſpeak of, I ſhall not be guilty of thoſe ſcorns and incivilities
towards</hi> Tullia, <hi>which ſhe was towards my Brother, becauſe it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
I ſhould ever be exempted from that reſpect which I owe her
Sex. But I would have her to know, that that deſtiny, rather then his
own reaſon, which forced my Brother into the extremities of blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and extravagance, hath not the ſame influence on me, and that
there can but little love be expected from me for a perſon guilty of ſo
much averſion for an innocent Prince, and one ſo eminent as</hi> Julius
Antonius <hi>was.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>While <hi>Ptolomey</hi> broke forth into theſe expreſſions, and chafed
himſelf into exaſperation by the ſight of that female enemy of
his, there paſſed things of a quite different nature in the ſoul of
<hi>Tullia;</hi> inſomuch that though that Beauty did all ſhe could to
heighten her deteſtation againſt <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> yet that paſſion, diſarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of its main ſtrength, was ſo far from contributing any thing
thereto, that it ſeemed of no force at all, and whether it were
that ſhe ſaw in the perſon of <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> (ſon to <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and not
to <hi>Fulvia,</hi> who had been <hi>Cicero</hi>'s implacable enemy, and much more
the occaſion of his death than <hi>Anthony</hi>) but one half of its object,
or that ſhe ſubmitted to ſome unknown power, ſhe refuſed to
obey in that emergency, and felt her ſelf diſpoſed of all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had kept up her ſpirit with ſo much conſtancy. In a word, to
ſpeak of her modeſty, <hi>Fulvia</hi> could not hate <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> though
poſſibly ſhe was not free from a deſire to do it, ſhe hearkened to
him, and looked on him as favourably as on others that were
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:97242:38"/>
preſent, ſhe was one of the laſt that withdrew; and when the
Company was diſſolved, ſhe did not expreſſe the leaſt diſſatisfaction
at that meeting, nor betrayed by any action or look, the leaſt aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for the perſon of <hi>Ptolomey.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In the mean time, I, having left</hi> Martia, <hi>retired into my own
Chamber, where I was no ſooner got, but</hi> Antonia <hi>comes in, and
coming to me with a countenance divided between a deſire of
laughing, and some inclination to be angry;</hi> Siſter, <hi>ſaid ſhe to me,</hi>
I have ſomewhat to make you merry withall, and ſince you find ſo
much diverſion in an adventure I take but little pleaſure in, I love
you too well to conceal any circumſtance from you, which may adde
any thing to your ſatisfaction. I have ſpent this whole day at the
Empreſſe's, where were all the moſt eminent about the Court, five or
ſix onely excepted that were at <hi>Sabina's,</hi> and this evening as I came
away, I found a Letter in my hand-kerchief, and cannot imagine
by what means it ſhould come thither without my knowledge; and
ſince I think it out of all queſtion that it comes from the ſame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
perſon you wot of, I thought ſit to bring it away with me, that
you might have the full ſatisfaction of it. <hi>Having with theſe words
put it into my hands, I took it without making her any reply, and
having opened it, found therein theſe words.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <div type="subpart">
                        <head>To the Fair ANTONIA.</head>
                        <p>I Have ſeen you this day, and found you brighter and more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
than the ſtar from which we derive our light, and have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated
of the excellencies of your converſation. You have
ſeen me, you have looked on me favourably, nay, ſuch was your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
you have given me leave to entertain you with as much free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
as any of thoſe that were preſent, nay, what is yet more, there
were ſome not ſo well treated as my ſelf, and whoſe condition I have
been far from envying, as to any thing hath happened this day. Hence
you may ſee, faireſt <hi>Antonia,</hi> what advantages I make of the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I have taken to conceal from you the name of your enemy. Had
you known me to be that criminel that durſt preſume to adore you,
and ſticks not to tell you ſo, I ſhould have been thruſt away with as
much contempt as <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and have been as diſcontented as
<hi>Archelaus,</hi> whoſe fortune hath not been much better. But in regard
you could not either in my countenance or yet in my deſignes perceave
the leaſt diſcovery of what I have in my heart, you have looked on
me, and treated me as an innocent perſon, though I really were the
moſt guilty of all the company. See then, incomparable Princeſſe,
whether <hi>I</hi> am any wayes to be blamed, for putting this trick upon
you, and pardon it me, ſince that, of all thoſe that ever were done, it
is the moſt innocent.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="71" facs="tcp:97242:38"/>
No queſtion Siſter but it is, <hi>ſaid I, having read out the letter,
and delivering it to her;</hi> he deſerves to be pardoned, for there
never was any thing of ſurpriſe or circumvention more excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable
than this. That then it your judgement, <hi>replies Antonia,</hi>
but for my part, <hi>I</hi> am not abſolutely of the ſame, and there is haply
in this artifice much more malice and deſign then you imagine. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
conceave, <hi>replyed I,</hi> what malice you can ſuſpect there may be
in it; I can ſee nothing but abundance of reſpect and care to avoid
the occaſions of diſpleaſing you. But Siſter, <hi>added I,</hi> can you not
ſuſpect any one of all thoſe you have ſeen to day? The number was
ſo great, <hi>replies Antonia,</hi> that I know not on whom particularly to
fix my thoughts, for there were preſent <hi>Agrippa, Mecaenas, Marcellus,
Domitius, Tiberius, Druſus, Craſſus, Aemilianus, Cinna, Cepio,
Pollio, Flavianus, Servilius, Polemon, Archelaus, Mithridates,
Varus;</hi> and, beſides theſe, all of the moſt eminent quality in <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi>'s
Court, ſo that among ſo many, it were impoſſible for me to make
any certain judgement.</p>
                        <p>Our diſcourſe had been longer upon this ſubject, had not <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomey</hi>
come into the room, and put us from what we were then
upon, with what he had to ſay of another accident had happened
to him. For he had no ſooner ſet his foot in the Chamber, but
crying out to me, as it were in a tranſport of joy, <hi>I have ſeen her,
Siſter,</hi> ſaid he to me, <hi>I have ſeen that terrible one, I have ſeen that
inexorable Beauty, and thanks be to the gods, ſhe hath done me no
hurt.</hi> Theſe words, uttered by him with a certain precipitation,
gave me not any light to gueſſe at the adventure had happened
to him, nor was it likely I ſhould have imagined any thing neer it;
but <hi>Antonia</hi> having asked him what it might be, he related to us
how he had met with the cruel <hi>Tullia,</hi> at <hi>Sabina's,</hi> how he had
paſſed away the whole day with her, and in a word, gave us a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
account of that meeting, even to the laſt circumſtances.
I was extreamly troubled at the relation, to ſee that inflexible
beauty, as it were newly reviving, by whoſe means we had loſt
our Brother, and was afraid ſome unfortunate accident would have
been the effect of her returne, which I had no ſooner diſcovered to
<hi>Ptolomey,</hi> but he made thouſands of proteſtations to me, accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with oaths, that there was not any woman in the World which he
ſhould not affect rather than <hi>Tullia,</hi> though he could not deny but
that he thought her very handſome, and was perſwaded ſhe had
abundance of worth in her. I was over-joyd at thoſe aſſurances,
as well becauſe I could not by any means affect <hi>Tullia,</hi> after the
loſſe of a Brother, ſuch as ſhe had forced away from us, as becauſe
I was deſirous that <hi>Ptolomey</hi> ſhould have been at the ſervice of
<hi>Martia,</hi> not onely for the extraordinary perfections of that
Princeſſe, the affection ſhe had for him, and the reſpects I had for
her, but alſo out of a conſideration of the advantages of Fortune
which muſt needs have followed upon that allyance, ſuch as he
had all the reaſon in the World to embrace. From that day I took
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:97242:39"/>
occaſion to diſcover my thoughts more and more to him, and to
repreſent to him what obligations he had to <hi>Martia, Octavia,</hi> and
her ſelf; and, ſeconded by <hi>Antonia,</hi> I made him ſo ſenſible of all
things, that, though he was not much ſubject to make over-ſerious
reflections on things, yet he promiſed us to devote himſelf abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
to <hi>Martia,</hi> for whom he had an infinite eſteem and affection,
and whom he would never give any occaſion to diſtruſt his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy;
inſomuch, that giving her a viſit that very night, he made
thouſands of proteſtations of his fidelity to her, and that with
circumſtances ſo full of ardor and obligation, that ſhew was extreamly
ſatisfied therewith.</p>
                        <p>The very ſame night, the unknown ſervant of <hi>Antonia</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
her with a <hi>Serenade,</hi> conſiſting of certain inſtruments, and
the beſt voices in the World. But, we two lying together, <hi>Antonia</hi>
ſaid it might be as well intended for me as for her, and that among
the voices ſhe knew ſome to be of the Emperours Muſick, whom
none but <hi>Tiberius</hi> could employ; but it was long ſince <hi>Tiberius</hi> and
I had expreſſed our ſelves one to another by <hi>Serenades,</hi> ſo that
<hi>Antonia</hi> was at laſt perſwaded to the contrary, when, after a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
which was ſung in ſeveral parts, the whole Muſick joyned
together to ſing theſe words which we heard diſtinctly, and which
I could not but remember, as having been ſung three or four
times over.</p>
                        <q>
                           <l>T' expreſſe his Love, the Lover is</l>

                        </q>
                        <p>There needed but theſe words to take away all conteſtation
between <hi>Antonia</hi> and my ſelf, inſomuch, that ſince it was out
of her power to remedy it, ſhe reſolved, though not without
much trouble, to endure the perſecution. I could not forbear
laughing at the diſturbance ſhe was in, and no queſtion but I might
have found a great pleaſure in the adventure, had my thoughts
been ſubject to a certain innocent miſchievouſneſſe, wherein per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of our age find themſelves no ſmal diverſion, But, beſides
that I have a natural diſ-inclination to any ſuch thing, the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
of my life have abated very much of my cheerful diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition;
and if it might be thought that I had at that time ſome
favourable intervals upon the news which came to Rome of the
great ſucceſſes of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> who with his ſword opened himſelf
a way to reaſcend the throne of his Anceſtors, I became on the
other ſide more and more ſuſpected at the Court, and it was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
threatned I ſhould be ſecured, as indeed I was, not long after,

There were already five or ſix dayes paſt ſince there was a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
expectation in Rome of a divertiſement which the Emperour
was to have upon the <hi>Tiber</hi> in one of the faireſt nights of the
Summer, to expreſſe the love he bore <hi>Terentia,</hi> as it was reported,
where by the means of certain artificial fires of the invention of
the Greeks there was made, in above a hundred ſeveral figures, a
new day upon the <hi>Tiber,</hi> wherein, becauſe it is not of it ſelf broad
enough for ſuch a kind of divertiſement, the Emperour hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
a new channel to be made below the City, which is ſix times
broader and deeper than the ordinary current: ſo that with that
light multiplyed by that of a thouſand torches, diſpoſed
along the banks on both ſides, there was ſeen a little ſea-ſight,
wherein a great number of ſmall boats, made after the manner of
men of war, and all covered over with artificial fires, croſſing and
engaging one the other, according to the order agreed on before,
entertained the Spectators with one of the moſt delightful ſights
in the World. The pleaſure of the eye was ſeconded by that
which was provided for the ear by the ſound of thouſands of war
inſtruments, which raiſed an echo from the banks of the River
for above a hundred <hi>Stadia</hi> about, and which inſtead of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
noiſe, made an harmonious ſound with much art, which,
ſmiting the ear, inſpired the moſt vigilant with a certain joy, and
raiſed up the ſpirits of the moſt dull. And whereas the boats
that are up and down the <hi>Tiber</hi> are very little, eſpecially in the
ordinary channel, and that there was requiſite a vaſt number of
them to receave thoſe perſons that would participate of the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement,
people were forced to divide themſelves into ſmall
parties, and for the moſt part there went but five or ſix perſons in
every boat. This was it that gave occaſion and birth to a thouſand
deſignes of gallantry, and obliged the young Romans to prepare
boats for the Ladies they were ſervants to, the moſt ſumptuous
could be made for the time. <hi>Tiberius</hi> had provided for me a
very magnificent one, and <hi>Archelaus</hi> another for <hi>Antonia,</hi> with
abundance of intreaties that ſhe would vouchſafe to accept of it;
but we, having no inclination to engage our ſelves into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of ſuch perſons, had reſolved-before hand to take a boat for
<hi>Antonia, Martia,</hi> and ſome others of our own ſex, under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> who had taken that charge upon him, and ſhould
have wayted upon us.</p>
                        <p>But while we were hot upon this reſolution, comes a perſon of
a goodly preſence to ſpeak with <hi>Antonia,</hi> and to acquai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>t her that
the Empreſſe had provided a boat for her, and ſuch of her Friends
as ſhe ſhould be pleaſed to take along with her, and had ſent him to
conduct them to it, and to take care for all things requiſite, during
the time of that nights divertiſement. Thought <hi>Antonia</hi> knew
not that Officer of the Empreſſe's, yet thought ſhe that ſhe could
not with civility refuſe what was proffered, and knowing her to
be naturally imperious, ſhe was the more affraid it might diſpleaſe
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:97242:40"/>
her, if ſhe made any difficulty to accept of it. Whereupon turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards me, as it were, to ask my advice, and perceiving my
comply ance with her intentions, ſhe returned the man an
anſwer, to this effect, That the Empreſſe did her too great an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
but that ſince it was her pleaſure ſo to diſpoſe of her, ſhe
receaved that favour with the ſame reſpects which ſhe ought to
have for all thoſe that proceeded from her goodneſſe; at which
words <hi>Martia</hi> and <hi>Ptolomey</hi> coming into the room, and having
confirmed her in that reſolution, deſired to be of our company,
and we took alſo along <hi>Sulpicia</hi> and <hi>Hortenſia,</hi> who were come to
give us a viſit. All the reſt of the houſe had diſpoſed of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
as they thought fit; <hi>Marcellus</hi> had prepared a boat for <hi>Julia,</hi>
and waited on her; <hi>Domitius</hi> had done the like for <hi>Agrippina,</hi>
and <hi>Agrippa</hi> for <hi>Marcella. Octavia</hi> ſtirred not out of her Chamber,
where I would have gladly kept her company, had ſhe given me
leave to do it. We went along with that Officer down to the
river ſide through the Garden, and at the door the boat waited
for us, which we got into without being able to take notice of the
ſuptuouſneſſe of it, by reaſon of the obſcurity of the place, which
was not yet enlightned. But we were ſcarce got in, ere the torches
were all lighted of an inſant, inſomuch that we were not a little
ſurpriſed as well at the ſuddenneſſe of the light, as the objects
that preſented themſelves to our ſight, which certainly were the
moſt delightful that can be imagined.</p>
                        <p>The boat was in the form of a little Galley compaſſed about by
a row of Pilaſters, which ſeemed to be of gold, but was indeed of
wood guilt; without which hung out a hundred arms guilt as the
row of Pilaſters, which ſuſtained a hundred great torches of virgin wax,
whereby the darkneſſe of the night was removed to the
diſtance of many ſtadia. The oars ſeemed to be of gold propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
to all the reſt, and the Rowers were twelve little Cupids
winged, armed with arrows and quiver, and covered with cloath
of gold in thoſe parts of their bodies where it was not requiſite
they ſhould be naked. At the extremity of the ſtern grew up a
golden tree, of the height of an ordinary maſt, having at the top
the form of a Scuttle, compaſſed about by a row of golden
Pilaſters and twelve arms proportionable to thoſe be low, wherein
were tw, lve torches, and in the midſt of all that ſight was a Heart
hanginge down, which ſeemed to be all on fire, and out of
which, by ſome ſtrange artifice there viſibly iſſued flames aſcending
up towards the ſtars, and made more light than all the torches. In
the diſtances which were between the torches were hung up twelve
Streamers, which were toſt up and down by the flames, and the
ſmoke a thouſand ſeveral wayes, and in which by reaſon of the
greatneſſe of the light, there might be diſtinctly ſeen double
A. A's, with other Characters, expreſſing ſeveral waies the word
<hi>ANTONIA.</hi> The ſame Letters, and the ſame Characters were
diſpoſed up and down all over the boat, as alſo upon the Pilaſters,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:97242:40"/>
the oars and the maſt, and it was ſo lightſome every where, that
the leaſt things could not be more diſtinctly diſcerned than they
were at that time.</p>
                        <p>But if we were ſo much ſurprized by what we were entertained
with, on the outſide of the boat, we could not but be ſo much
the more, when we were brought into the chamber that was
within it, where we had no ſooner ſet foot, but our ſight was
dazled with the luſtre of the gold and other embeliſhments,
wherewith it ſparkled again. Where ever there was any gold
to be beſtowed, it was with the greateſt profuſion imaginable;
and where there was any neceſſity to heighten the richneſs of the
matter, by the perfection of art, all was done with admirable
dexterity, but with this every where obſervable, that the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of <hi>ANTONIA</hi> were ſcattered up and down all places.
The ground work and the ſeeling had the ſame, and the hangings,
the chaires and the cuſhions were of sky-coloured Velvet, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled
with flames of gold in embrodery, as alſo burning Hearts,
Characters of <hi>Antonia,</hi> and the firſt letters of her name. This
little Chamber was admirably enlightned, and perfumed with the
moſt delightfull ſents that <hi>Arabia</hi> could afford: and what was yet a
greater convenience, (which was, that we might without ſtirring
out of the Chamber, participate of that nights divertiſement, and
might be ſeen by all thoſe that were upon the <hi>Tiber</hi>) that part of
it which was covered by the hangings, was onely of glaſſe, ſo that
as ſoon as thoſe, which were made curtain-wiſe for that purpoſe,
were drawn, the river lay open to our ſights of all ſides, the
Chamber it ſelf was viſible to all that were in the other boats, and
the light that was ſcattered by ſo vaſt a number of torches as were
diſpoſed about our Galley, and which enlightned the Chamber fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
upon the glaſſe, as well without as within, made ſuch a fire
on the river, as found light for all the other boats, and ſeized with
aſtoniſhment all thoſe that ſaw it.</p>
                        <p>You are not I believe, Siſter, much in doubt whether we were
much ſurpriſed or not, when we found our ſelves in that little
enchanted veſſel, and you would be ſoon perſwaded that we had
been deceaved, and that it was not to the Empreſſe that we were
obliged for that magnificent lodging. <hi>Antonia</hi> looked on me, not
knowing what to think of thoſe things, and I could eaſily perceave
in her countenance that ſhe was to ſeek as to all reſolution, and
that ſhe was vext to the heart at the trick had been put upon her.
She looked all about for that Officer of <hi>Livia,</hi> but he was vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as ſoon they were gotten into the boat, ſo that there was onely
the <hi>Cupids</hi> that rowed, left for her to wreak her indignation
upon.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time, which way ſoever ſhe looked, ſhe met with
her own Characters and the Letters of her name ſcattered up and
down amongſt the burning hearts, and what ſhe was moſt of all
troubled at, was, that the very ſame Characters were expoſed in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:97242:41"/>
the ſtreamers at the top-maſt, fluttering as it were amidſt the
flames of that burning Heart, and, by reaſon of the great light
whereby they were encompaſſed, were viſible to all that were
upon the River. The vexation it was to her to ſee her ſelf enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with that paſſion which ſhe had ſo much averſion for, had
put her out of all patience, if <hi>Ptolomey, Martia,</hi> and my ſelf had
not laughed her into a good humour, and told her, that if the
ſame thing had happened to us, we had entertained the adventure
with abundance of enjoyment. By this means did we make a ſhift
to diſpel the clouds of her melancholy, and diſturbance, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
at leaſure all thoſe rarities which we could not have diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at firſt ſight.</p>
                        <p>But this was not our employment alone, for this great fire, and
that admirable object which it diſcovered, had hardly appeared
on the waves of <hi>Tiber,</hi> but all the boats left the places they had
taken up, to come neerer to that which they wondred at ſo much
at a diſtance. The Torches, the Heart, the Streamers which were,
from the top of the maſt, remarkable on all ſides, immediately
drew all the World to it; inſomuch that the Emperour himſelf,
ſurpriſed at this ſight as well as others, cauſed his own boat to
approach it, At firſt the report went from one to another that it
was <hi>Antonia's</hi> Galley, ſo that all coming as neer as they could to
<hi>Antonia's</hi> Galley, there could hardly be any thing elſe heard on
the water, but <hi>Antonia's</hi> Galley, and the greateſt part were reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
onely to follow it, not minding much the other divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
for which they were aſſembled. The Emperour, <hi>Livia,
Marcellus, Julia, Agrippa,</hi> and all the moſt conſiderable perſons
having compaſſed it about not without aſtoniſhment, <hi>Auguſtus</hi>
aſked who had beſtowed that magnificent Galley on <hi>Antonia?</hi>
To which the Princeſſe not knowing what to imagine could onely
ſay that ſhe had receaved it from the liberality of the Empreſſe.
<hi>Livia</hi> began to deny that ſhe had made her any ſuch preſent, which
the Emperour hearing, told her ſhe needed not take ſuch pains to
vindicate her ſelf, and that it was apparent from all ſigns and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
that that exceſſe of gallantry &amp; magnificence proceeded
from the invention and prodigality of ſome Lover. But while all
theſe eminent perſons were aſſembled about the Galley, ſix of the
<hi>Cupids,</hi> who were the Rowers, coming into the Chamber, drew the
hangings, and diſcovering through the tranſparent walls thereof
what was within the Chamber, filled all that were preſent with a
new aſtoniſhment, and all the places about with a new light, which
both neer and at a diſtance was the moſt delightful thing that could
be ſeen.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall not trouble you with any further particulars of that nights
entertainment, the deſcription I have already made thereof having
been haply too long, and therefore ſhall onely tell you, that, when
all had ſufficiently admired <hi>Antonia's</hi> Galley, and had ſpent a
long time in talking of it, had almoſt tyred themſelves in gueſſing
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:97242:41"/>
at the Authour of ſo ſumptuous an invention, and had celebrated
this ſight beyond thoſe that were to ſucceed it, they all advanced
towards the place where they were to be entertained with the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight,
and the artificial fires, doing our Galley the honour to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it, as it it had been the Leader of them, the lights of all the
others being as much darkened by ours, as the ſmaller ſtars are by
the raies of that bright torch whence we derive our day. I ſhall
not give you any deſcription of that nights divertiſements, which
it muſt be confeſſed were not unworthy <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s magnificence; but
ſhall onely tell you, that when all was over, and that it was
thought time for all to retire, <hi>Julia</hi> coming into our Galley, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with <hi>Marcellus, Agrippina, Domitius, Marcella,</hi> and <hi>Agrippa,</hi>
(for <hi>Tiberius,</hi> ſeeing that I had refuſed the boat he had prepared
for me, thought fit upon point of reſentment to continue ſtill in
<hi>Caeſar</hi>'s, and accordingly never came neer us) and having ſeated
themſelves about the Chamber upon chairs, the floor or planks
that were under them immediately opened, and we frightned at it,
began to cry out, for fear the boat ſhould ſinck, when there riſes
up from below a table covered with as magnificent a collation as
ever could have been ſerved among the <hi>Romans,</hi> not excepting the
ſumptuous entertainments of <hi>Lucullus;</hi> nay, ſuch it was, that
<hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Marcellus,</hi> who were not wont to wonder at great
things, were aſtoniſhed at the magnificence and the neatneſſe of it.
In a word, what ever came to <hi>Rome</hi> from forreign and remote
Nations that were moſt rare and exquiſite was there, and that
heightned admirably by art, but, what moſt troubled <hi>Antonia,</hi> was,
that what modes or forms ſoever the ſervices were of, or what
figure ſoever they were diſpoſed into, (wherein there had been
more than ordinary care taken) the Characters of <hi>Antonia</hi> were
ſcattered up and down amongſt the burning Hearts, after the ſame
manner as they had been all about the veſſel. This ſtirred up
their curioſity afreſh, to find out who this ſervant of <hi>Antonia</hi>
might be, inſomuch that <hi>Marcellus</hi> having acquainted <hi>Agrippa</hi> with
what he had receaved from us, they ſought and gueſſed a long
time, but after all could not fix on any perſon whom they could
with any probability affirm to be the man. But I ſhall trouble you
with no more as to that, we made an end of our Collation, we
went away with the reſt of the Company, and retired with matter
enough for diſcourſe as to to that adventure, but what was moſt
pleaſant of all, was, that, abating the trouble which <hi>Antonia</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved
thereat, as we undreſſed our ſelves, ſhe found another
Letter in one of her ſleeves, though ſhe thought ſhe had made
ſufficient proviſion againſt any ſuch thing. I was haſty enough to
read it, and found the words of it to be the theſe.</p>

                        <p>YOu ſee then, faireſt Princeſſe, how much I am obliged to arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and how I effect that by <hi>ſtratagem,</hi> which I ſhould never
compaſſe by open hoſtility. You have granted the <hi>Unknown
Lover,</hi> what you had denyed Kings that were <hi>profeſſed</hi> Lovers;
and though he be obliged for this good Fortune to the name of <hi>Livia,</hi>
for which you have had ſo much reſpect, yet is he much more engaged
for it to his own induſtry, and the confidence he had to effect his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.
You will pardon me that I have entertained you in ſo poor a
place, ſince I acknowledge I cannot conceave any noble enough to
receave you, and cannot wiſh you any other then that Heart which
you ſaw burning this day in the publick ſacrifice I have made thereof
to you. In a word, my Fortune, whatever it may be, hath been
envyed this day by all that is great and eminent in the Empire,
whence I derive a certain hope that it will one day be envyed
by all that ſhall think themſelves the moſt fortunate in the
World.</p>
                        <p>I cannot, <hi>ſaid I, having made an end of reading the letter,</hi> but
acknowledge, that this man, what ever he may be, is an extraordinary
Gallant, a great wit, and inexpreſſibly magnificent. I grant you all
that, <hi>replyed Antonia,</hi> but you muſt anknowledge withall, that there
is a certain ſpice of extravagance in his deſign, and that all the
pains he takes will amount to nothing. That I cannot tell you, <hi>reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
I,</hi> nay methinks I already perceave he hath effected ſome part of
his intentions, for in that he hath declared to you at the beginning,
that there is no other reaſon of his recourſe to this artifice, then to
induce you to endure the name of Love, and to reconcile you to that
paſſion, which you avoid as a Monſter, becauſe you are not acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with it, you muſt needs acknowledge that he hath already prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with you, to endure, not onely the diſcourſe, but all the expreſſions
of it, much beyond what you had ſuffered in all your life before, and,
in a word, that you have held a greater correſpondence with love,
ſince you firſt entertained the addreſſes of this one Vnknown Servant
then you did upon thoſe of all the reſt put together. Ah Siſter,
<hi>replies Antonia very roundly,</hi> what inclinations do I derive from
what you ſay to hate him the more, and yet how true is that which
you have obſerved, and I muſt with ſhame acknowledge it to be ſuch!
But if it be poſſible, I will remedy it one way or other. What remedy
can you think of, <hi>ſaid I to her,</hi> while you are kept in this ignorance?
This man is haply of ſuch a nature, that he will not diſcover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
while he lives, and though we may very well from the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendency
of his thoughts and attempts, infer the greatneſſe of his
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:97242:42"/>
birth, yet may it not poſſibly be ſuch, as may furniſh him with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
enough to declare himſelf. Since we are fallen into this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
Siſter, <hi>ſaies Antonia,</hi> I am to acquaint you, that not many
dayes ſince I found, in one of my Gloves, another Letter which I
purpoſely forbore to ſhew you by reaſon of ſome diſcontent that you
were in that day concerning <hi>Tiberius;</hi> but kept it nevertheleſſ, that
it might be communicated to you, for you know that I mind them only
in order to your diverſion. No, <hi>ſaid I to her ſmiling,</hi> tis becauſe you
would have me no further acquainted with your ſecrets; at which
words perceaving ſhe had found the Letter, I took it from her, and

                        <p>This letter furniſhed us with more matter of diſcourſe and
imagination then all the reſt; but at laſt, having done all we
could, we reſolved not to trouble our ſelves any further, and to
expect with patience what might be the conſequences of that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture.
<hi>Ptolomey,</hi> to whom I had given one of the letters, had
made it his buſineſſe to enquire all about, whether there were
any ſuch hand among thoſe perſons of. quality, and never
could meet with any that came neer it, <hi>Marcellus</hi> had done the
like, but to as little purpoſe. All that paſſed before had made no
great noiſe, but the Galley occaſioned abundance of diſcourſe,
inſomuch that for many dayes after, the talk of all Companies
was of the magnificent Galley of <hi>Antonia.</hi> The King of <hi>Cappadocia</hi>
taking occaſion to make a modeſt complaint to her upon her refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
of the boat which he had provided for her, told her ſhe had
very much reaſon to ſlight that, when ſhe expected another that
was ſo magnificent. But <hi>Antonia</hi> ſatisfied him as much as lay in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:97242:43"/>
her power, telling him that it was not for its ſumptuouſneſſe
that ſhe had preferred that Galley before his boat, nor yet out of
any other conſideration, then that it had been proffered her in the
Empreſſe's name, from whom ſhe neither could nor ought to have
refuſed it. <hi>Archelaus,</hi> a Prince of a diſpoſition eaſie to be pleaſed,
was ſatisfied with that anſwer; but could do no leſſe withal then
conceave abundance of jealouſie againſt that Unknown Lover,
whoſe preſents were preferred before his, and reſolved to do all
that lay in his power to diſcover him. <hi>Mithridates</hi> was as earneſt
in the ſame deſign as the other, and though he had been ſlighted
by <hi>Antonia</hi> in ſuch manner, that, notwithſtanding his great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
he durſt hardly open his lips before her, to entertain her
with any thing of his love, after the diſcovery he had once made
to her thereof; yet was not his paſſion quite ſmothered, nor his
jealouſie inferiour to that of <hi>Archelaus.</hi> Being therefore both
unfortunate, and their loves encouraged by little hope, jealouſie
had not produced in them its ordinary effect amongſt Rivals, and
had left in them friendſhip enough to viſit one the other, and to
communicate part of what they thought one to another; ſo that
having mutually acquainted one another with the deſires they
had to diſcover who that Unknown Lover might be, who had
made ſuch ſignal demonſtrations of his gallantry towards
<hi>Antonia,</hi> they reſolved to joyne their endeavours to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and not to leave any thing unattempted to find out the
truth.</p>
                        <p>Many dayes paſt ere any one came wherein they could diſcover
any thing, though they had their ſpies in all places, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
took occaſion to walk themſelves in the night about <hi>Octavia</hi>'s
Palace, out of ſome hopes they might meet with him, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but that he might have ſome haunt thereabouts, eſpecially at
the time that he was wont to entertain her with ſerenades, which
he had done ſeveral times. At laſt, after abundance of fruitleſſe
enquiry, fortune would needs have it, that, one of thoſe nights
wherein they were both together on horſeback, without any other
company then that of certain ſlaves, who were afoot, coming into
the ſtreet into which our Chamber looked, they heard the ſound
of certain inſtruments and voices, making an excellent conſort
almoſt under our window. They made no queſtion but they had
met with what they ſought after, as knowing that <hi>Tiberius</hi> had
given over entertaining me with ſerenades, that ſince the departure
of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> there was not any perſon in <hi>Rome</hi> that had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
any inclinations for me, and that the lodgings of <hi>Agrippina,
Marcella</hi> and <hi>Martia,</hi> were in another part of the Palace at a
good diſtance from that; beſides that they alſo knew that the
Unknown Lover had given divers others before, and that, having
not the liberty to expreſſe himſelf as others did, he took occaſion
to diſcover his intentions by demonſtrations of gallantry of that
nature.</p>

The two amorous Princes, not doubting but that they were in
the right, reſolved not to let ſlip the opportunity they now had
to be informed of what they were ſo deſirous to know, and to
attempt any thing rather then not to effect their deſign. They
cauſed no torches to be brought with them, not onely out of a
deſire to avoid being diſcovered, but indeed that it was but too

                           </gap>, but they perceave a man
on horſeback, who leaving the place where he was as ſoon as they
came in ſight, went to the muſick, and bid them give over and
diſperſe themſelves as ſoon as they could. From this action the
two Princes immediately inferred that it muſt infallibly be the
Unknown Lover; and being abſolutely reſolved to make all the
advantages they could of that accident, they came on further
into the ſtreet, and paſſed under our windowes, where they could
neither hear nor find any body. They made a little halt to liſten,
and, whereas the man they had ſeen on horſeback could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
himſelf as they could that were a foot, and that the horſe
muſt needs make a great noiſe going upon the ſtones, they could
eaſily both hear and ſee him at a certain diſtance before, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
what he could to get away. They on the other ſide as
carefully purſued him, and paſſed through many ſtreets, following
him ſtill by the noiſe, and ſeeing him before them. The Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
perceaving their reſolution to follow him, put on ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
faſter, and made towards the moſt ſolitary ſtreets, ſo to get
out of their ſight: but that ſtood him in no ſtead, for they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him every where, with ſo much obſtinacy, that they gave
him at laſt ſome ground to imagine, that it would be a hard matter
for him to get off. At length, having forced him into a ſtreet, at
the other end whereof he ſaw ſeveral torches and Chariots that
might hinder his further paſſage, he made a ſtand, and, turning
toward thoſe that purſued him, took one ſide of the ſtreet, as it
were to give them the way. But they rid up to him, and <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi>
oppoſing the deſigne he had to make an eſcape, <hi>Do not hope,</hi>
ſaid he to him, <hi>to get hence, or to avoid us, if thou doſt not
diſcover thy ſelf; and therefore tell us who thou art, if thou wouldſt
have the paſſage free to be gone.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Unknown perſon retreated ſome few paces at this action
of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and having reflected a little on what he had to
do, he ſet ſpurs to his horſe, and quick as lighting fell in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the two Princes, who were very near one the other, and
ruſhing on <hi>Mithridates,</hi> who was on his left hand, with all the
violence he could both of himſelf and his horſe, (which was
one of the beſt in the World) and at the ſame time as he paſſed
by, laying hold with his right hand on <hi>Archelaus</hi>'s bridle, he, with
the ſhock of his horſe, overthrew <hi>Mithridates</hi> horſe and man to
the ground, and with that he gave <hi>Archelaus</hi>'s at the ſame time,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:97242:44"/>
made him ſtand upright, in ſuch manner, that the Prince falling
backwards, and holding ſtill faſt by the bridle, overturned the
horſe upon himſelf.</p>
                        <p>Their fall proved ſhrewd enough, and their condition ſuch,
that they found it no ſmall difficulty to get up again, eſpecially
ſeeing that they were not attended by any, and that the ſlaves
they had brought with them, being afoot, had loſt them in the
ſeveral turnings they had made. At laſt, they made a ſhift to
riſe, not a little bruiſed, and, going with ſome difficulty, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
one another with no ſmall confuſion. For, all conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they were not ſo much troubled at the fall they had receaved,
or the hurt occaſioned thereby, as that they had been ſo treated by
a ſingle perſon, and one they had forced to that action by their own
unſatisfied purſuit. They ſtood a while looking one upon the other,
as not being able to find out terms fit to expreſſe what their hearts
were burthened with; but at length, <hi>Mithridates,</hi> as being the
moſt eager and impatient, was the firſt that ſpoke, and expreſſed
the reſentment he had of that adventure in words full of fire,
and viſible demonſtrations of his fury. <hi>Archelaus</hi> endured that
unfortunate encounter with more moderation, and told <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi>
that there was no more happened to them then what they
had deſerved, and that ordinarily there was no other ſatisfaction
to be given to curioſities that were ſo neer a kin to indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</p>
                        <p>At laſt they with much ado got up on horſeback, and returned to
their lodgings, where having gotten into their beds, they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to keep them for ſome dayes. <hi>Mithridates,</hi> for his part, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
troubled at the adventure, was deſirous to conceal it;
but <hi>Archelaus,</hi> being a perſon more inclined to ſincerity and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and whoſe proceedings, in the affection he bore to <hi>Antonia,</hi>
were more clear, made no difficulty to acquaint all thoſe that
came to viſit him with the truth of the buſineſſe, ſo that the very
next day, it was generally known, and was become the ſubject of
all mens talk. We ſoon underſtood it from <hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Ptolomey,</hi>
and the perpetual diſcourſes, which all entertained <hi>Antonia</hi> with
about it, added very much to the diſquiet ſhe was in before. But
what troubled <hi>Mithridates</hi> more then all the reſt, was a Letter that
was brought to <hi>Archelaus,</hi> and which <hi>Archelaus</hi> ſent him, as ſoon
as he had peruſed it himſelf, as having been directed to both,
whereof the words were theſe.</p>

                           <hi>I</hi> Am much troubled at the ſmall misfortune that hath befallen you,
though, out of a deſire of your own ſatisfaction you were your
ſelves the occaſions of it; and ſince I am no enemy of yours,
though I have done ſome hurt, I ſhould have wiſhed your curioſity a
ſlighter puniſhment, had you left it to my choice. You may hence
learn to beware how you hereafter purſue, with ſo much violence, thoſe
that would avoid you, and remember that you are to make a bridge
of gold for a retreating enemy. If you are chargeable with no
crime but <hi>curioſity,</hi> disburthen your ſelves of it, as being a vice
whereof you will find the inconveniences to be far greater than the
advantages; but if you are withal guilty of <hi>jealouſie,</hi> learn, that
<hi>jealouſie</hi> is a ſelf-diſturbing paſſion, whereof the effects are ever
dangerous, and elude the expectation. Beſides it is not much for
your reputation to be jealous of a perſon that's unknown to you; and
did you know me, you would haply find, that I am too much below
you to do you any prejudice. In a word, whatever I may be, aſſure
your ſelves I wiſh you no other hurt then that you may ſee me more

                        <p>This Letter had been delivered to one of <hi>Archelaus</hi>'s Officers,
by a man that as ſoon as he had done, was vaniſhed, and could not
be ſeen after, as having gone his wayes without being obſerved by
any one, ſo that the two Princes were ſtill in the ſame ignorance
they were in before. They were both very much netled at it,
though in a different meaſure, according to their ſeveral diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
and if <hi>Archelaus</hi> was more moderate than <hi>Mithridates,</hi> yet
was he not leſſe moved at the ſatyrical ſtile of his Rival. The
laſt words of the Letter were thoſe that troubled them moſt,
and they thought that fantaſtick circumſtance of their adventure
the moſt indigeſtible of any, that among their Friends that came
dayly to give them their viſits, they were to expect him that had
put them into the condition they were in, and who haply might
prove him, they thought the moſt endeared, and could the leaſt
ſuſpect. This reflection made them look on all that came to ſee
them with a certain diſtruſt, and taking it for granted that their
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:97242:45"/>
Rival was of that number, they ſought him among them without
any diſtinction, and that poſſibly ſometimes where they were the
moſt unlikely to find him. They fell into diſcourſe with all thoſe
that came to them upon that accident, and obſerved their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
while they talked to ſee what inferences they might draw
thence, but all proved ineffectual. For <hi>Archelaus</hi> and <hi>Mithridates</hi>
being perſons that for their rank, their vertue, and the reſpects
which the Emperour had for them, were very conſiderable among
the <hi>Romans,</hi> there were few among the Families that were moſt
Illuſtrious that came not to viſit then, ſo that amidſt ſo great a
number, they made fruitleſſe inquiſitions for that which in a leſſer
they might poſſibly have diſcovered. <hi>Archelaus</hi> hath told me ſince
that he was never at ſuch a loſſe in all his life, and that, fearing
he might ſee the face of his Rival in all thoſe that came neer him,
his thoughts were in ſuch a diſtraction, that for ſome minutes he
could not make any return to their civilities: and for <hi>Mithridates,</hi>
he looked on all as enemies, though his reſentment was directed
to one ſingle indeterminate perſon. A few dayes recovered them

was celebrated every year on the day of <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s birth, on which

not ſo violent as to deprive him of the divertiſements he was
addicted to, among other deſignes of pleaſure, wherein he was
every day engaged, went one day with a many other perſons to
walk in the ſame Garden of <hi>Lucullus</hi>'s, whereof I have given you
ſo large an account already. Having ſlipped away from his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
to enjoy more privately that of young <hi>Lentulus,</hi> whoſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
of all his friends, he found the moſt conſonant to his own,
and deſirous to diſcourſe with him about divers things which they
mutually communicated one to another, they ſought out the moſt
ſolitary walks, as being reſolved not to joyn their company for ſome
time. As they paſſed through one of the moſt remote from all
company, they perceaved, at a good diſtance from them, two wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who ſeemed to them to be of a very goodly preſence, and
though they were alone, yet the ſumptuouſneſſe of their habit,
which they could perceave glittering, eaſily argued them to be
perſons of quality, who ſeeking ſolitude as they did, had left
their attendants in ſome other part of the garden. Theſe women
were coming towards them, but as ſoon as they had eyed them at
ſuch a diſtance as it was impoſſible for them to know one another,
they turned aſide into another walk, and continued their ſolitude.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:97242:45"/>
Theſe two young men, having a more than ordinary curioſity, and
whoſe thoughts were employed in their pleaſures wherever they
were to be had, were ſuddenly poſſeſſed with certain deſirs to know
who thoſe two women might be, and their ſhunning of them
adding to their inquiſitiveneſſe, they reſolved to follow them, and,
if poſſible, to know who they were. To that end they went into
the ſame walk where they were, and had ſoon overtaken them,
if the Ladies, having perceaved them, had not avoided meeting
with them, by turning aſide, and paſſing over one of the Bridges,
to get into ſome of the little Iſles that are made ſuch by the Rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,
and wherein there are in ſeveral places green Arbours, made
of the boughs of trees twiſted together ſo thick, that when the
Sun darts down his moſt perpendicular rayes, they can hardly find
a paſſage through them.</p>
                        <p>Having obſerved the way they intended to take, and ſatisfied of
the deſign they had to avoid all company, they bethought them
that without an exceſſe of indiſcretion, they could not be ſo
troubleſome as to follow them any longer. But they on the other
ſide having reſolved, out of a curioſity natural to young people,
to have a ſight of them, and that the goodlineſſe of their perſons
had very much advanced their deſires of it, took notice of the
way they took, with a deſign to meet them by other turnings,
which they were not unacquainted with, which yet they might
have done without any bodies perceaving what game they were
in chace of. Accordingly, having traced them through divers trees
that lay between both, they at laſt ſaw them go in to one of the
little Iſles, and made no queſtion but they would go and reſt
themſelves in one of the Arbours. They thought it their be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

courſe to give them the time to do ſo, and ſo having taken a good
walk, they made towards the Iſle by other wayes, and paſſed over
another bridge then that by which the women had gone in. They
were no ſooner got in, but coming behind one of the Arbours,
on a certain ſide at which they could not be diſcovered, they
heard the voice of a woman ſinging in the Arbour, and, making
a halt, to give her the greater attention, they found her admirable,
not onely as to the voice, but alſo as to the skill whereby it was
not a little heightened. They at firſt heard her at ſome diſtance,
out of a fear of making any noiſe to interrupt her; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
perceaving that they had much adoe to hear the words, and
confident withal, that if the noiſe did not diſcover them, they
might go quite to the Arbour, without any danger of being ſeen,
by reaſon of the thickneſſe of the branches and leaves which
admitted not any paſſage for the ſight, they went as ſoftly as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
they could, and came to the Arbour time enough to hear theſe
words, which were the laſt that were ſung.</p>

                        <p>Theſe words were no ſooner heard by <hi>Ptolomey</hi> and <hi>Lentulus,</hi>
but they withal perceaved, by the voice, that it was <hi>Emilia</hi> that
ſpoke them, and could not be ignorant, having heard her name
pronounced, that they were addreſſed to <hi>Tullia.</hi> They were both
equally ſurpriſed thereat, and <hi>Lentulus</hi> looking on my Brother

all that he would have ſaid upon ſo unexpected an adventure,

that action, and other geſtures, he conjured him from making any
noiſe, and to hear attentively as well as himſelf, a diſcourſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
if he were not miſtaken, he thought himſelf very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.
<hi>Ptolomey</hi> was willing enough to comply with his deſires,
ſo that, continuing in the ſame puſture they were in before, they
heard <hi>Emilia</hi> reaſſuming the diſcourſe; <hi>Speak, my deareſt</hi> Tullia,
ſaid ſhe, <hi>and ſince I am the onely perſon in the World whom you
think fit to entruſt with a ſecret that is ſo neer your heart, eaſe your
ſpirits as much as you can, by acquainting me with what you
would conceal from all but</hi> Emilia. <hi>We are now where all things
favour our deſigne, ſo far, that the Sun it ſelf, did he ſhine, could
not participate of the ſecret that is between us, and all things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote

my deareſt friend, and open to me that heart, which being hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hard and impenetrable to all love and compaſſion, does now

While <hi>Emilia</hi> was ſpeaking in this manner, <hi>Lentulus</hi> had found
a way, by turning the leaves aſide, to make a little paſſage for his
ſight, and as good fortune would have it, he could through
that little place direct it juſt upon <hi>Tullia's</hi> face. By this happy

looſe and negligent poſture, and all her geſtures ſpoke a certain
remiſſeneſſe, but all that negligence, all that languiſhing did but
heighten her ordinary beauty, inſomuch that there ſeemed to
<hi>Lentulus</hi> to be much more luſtre and divinity in it then he had ever

                        <p>
                           <hi>He further perceived that after ſhe had with ſome difficulty
prevailed with her ſelf to comply with the ſollicitations of</hi> Emilia,
<hi>aſſuming the diſcourſe with an action wherein were eaſily remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
all the expreſſions of ſadneſſe and confuſion:</hi> Why will you
oblige me, <hi>ſaid ſhe to her,</hi> to repeat to you what my eyes, what my
heart, what my mouth have already acquainted you with? Are you
ſo much in love with my grief, as to be delighted with the unhappy
demonſtrations I give you of it? Or would you have me, out of a
reflection upon ſo many acknowledgements as I have made of my unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
weakneſſe and cowardice, to dye for ſhame and confuſion before
you? If it muſt be ſo, my deareſt <hi>Emilia,</hi> I am content, and ſince
you are, and ever ſhall be, while I have a minute to breath, the onely
perſon to whom I ſhall diſcover my misfortune, I am willing my moſt
ſecret imaginations ſhould paſſe out of my heart into yours, and wiſh
you may be moved with pitty for the miſery which my inflexible
deſtiny hath forced me into. I ſay, my deſtiny, <hi>Emilia,</hi> for it is
that onely that I can juſtly charge with all the misfortunes I am
fallen into. Do not imagine it any effect of the celeſtial vengeance
upon me for the rigour I expreſſed towards <hi>Julius Antonius.</hi> Though
I have contributed very much to his abſence, and am charged as the
occaſion of it, yet have I not been troubled with the leaſt remorſe
for any deportment of mine towards him. Being <hi>Cicero's</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I could not upon the firſt addreſſes of his affection to me, be
obliged to entertain any ſuch thing from him; and reflecting on the
death of <hi>Cecinna,</hi> whom, being to be my Husband within three daies,
he killed in my ſight, upon my account, I was certainly diſpenſed
from whatever the expreſſions of his love might require of me in
his favour. And yet, the powers of heaven are my witneſſes that
I never hated him, that I never wiſhed him any ill fortune, that I
have acknowledged his great worth, and that I do at this day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,
notwithſtanding my preſent ſentiments, that he is as great as
to point of merit, and as amiable as to his perſon as <hi>Ptolomey</hi> is
himſelf. So that there is no ground to imagine that the gods ſhould
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97242:47"/>
inflict all this as a puniſhment of my cruelty; but that it proceeds
meerly from my deſtiny which in this emergency acts againſt me, as
it hath done through all the misfortunes that have happened to our
houſe.</p>
                        <p>But, my deareſt <hi>Tullia, replied Emilia,</hi> ſince you would not be flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
in your paſſion, may it not be repreſented to you, that the ſame
reaſons which you alledged againſt the love and merits of <hi>Julius
Antonius,</hi> before he became an impardonable criminal by the death
of <hi>Cecinna,</hi> might with much more ground be urged againſt the
affection which you have conceived for his Brother; ſince that not
being obliged to him for any the leaſt demonſtration of love, you
cannot but look on him as the Son of <hi>Anthony,</hi> which he is, you
know, no leſſe then his Brother? I am, no queſtion, <hi>replyed Tullia,</hi>
obliged by the ſame reaſons to do the one as the other, at leaſt in
ſome part, (for I might tell you, did I ſtand upon my juſtification;
that <hi>Ptolomey</hi> is not by his birth ſuch a criminal to us as his brother
was, ſince that he is Son to Queen <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> who contributed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the death of <hi>Cicero,</hi> and not to <hi>Fulvia,</hi> who alone engaged
<hi>Anthony</hi> in that deſign, and exerciſed her cruelty upon the body of
my Father, even after death, by a many abominable indignities) but
ſuch was my misfortune, that I could not make uſe of them, and I
need not tell you, that in thoſe of this nature, the aſſiſtances of
reaſon are not alwayes infallible. You may further argue, that I
have hardly ſeen <hi>Ptolomey</hi> above once, that he is a Prince younger
than my ſelf by five or ſix years, and a perſon that neither does, nor
haply will love me while he lives. All the anſwer I have to make to
theſe objections, is, That my misfortunes are ſo much the more to be
bemoaned, and that the rather, out of a conſideration that I have
not contributed any thing thereto my ſelf, and have endured this
violence to tyrannize over my heart, without the leaſt complyance
of my will. Pitty me then, if you pleaſe, <hi>Emilia,</hi> and charge me
not with an offence which I ſee no reaſon I ſhould take upon me. Tis
not in the power of either Vertue, or the Study of Philoſophy to make
us uncapable of paſſions, but onely teach us how to ſtruggle with
them; and if they have not been able to make good the little garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of my heart againſt the aſſaults of that which now diſturbs my
quiet, they will ſo weaken it, as that it ſhall not produce therein any
effects that may ſtain my reputation at the preſent, or my memory
hereafter. I have been able to look on the Son of <hi>Anthony,</hi> but it
ſeems under an unhappy conſtellation which made me indeed but too
ſenſible of what I thought amiable in his perſon: I have been able
to preſerve the remembrance of it too dearly for my own quiet; I
cannot think of him without tenderneſſe, I can ſpeak of him with
delight, I can communicate my ſufferings to you, I can ſigh, and as
you ſee, weep and bewayle, this ſad exchange of my condition. But
this, <hi>Emilia,</hi> is all that this deſtructive paſſion can work in my ſoul,
ſo that all the tempeſts it is able to raiſe there, ſhall not eclipſe thoſe
lights of wiſdom, which it is not in the power of any blindneſſe to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:97242:47"/>
extinguiſh. I can pine away, yet conceale from all the World, <hi>Emilia</hi>
onely excepted, the reaſon why I do ſo; and if I muſt endure, even
to death it ſelf, I can eaſily do it, not onely rather than open my
lips, but rather then become guilty of a wiſh that ſhould any way
ſtain my reputation, or caſt a blemiſh on the former part of
my life.</p>
                        <p>But, when all is done, <hi>replies Emilia,</hi> to ſpeak ſincerely, could you
not wiſh that <hi>Ptolomey</hi> loved you, or can you, with all your Wiſdom
and Philoſophy, oppoſe ſuch a wiſh? <hi>To this</hi> Tullia <hi>could not for
ſome minutes make any poſitive anſwer; but having a little after
ſhaken off that ſuſpence, and reaſſuming the diſcourſe with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
bluſh, wherewith</hi> Lentulus <hi>could perceive her face all cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
The deſire of being loved, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> by that which one loves, is
a thing ſo natural in us, that I durſt not tell you, that I did not wiſh
my ſelf loved by <hi>Ptolomey;</hi> but you are withall to aſſure your ſelf,
that this wiſh is ſo innocent as not to injure my vertue: nay I muſt
adde thus much, that though it ſhould prove effectuall, yet would not
my condition be any thing the more fortunate, and that <hi>Ptolomey</hi>
himſelf, though he ſhould love me, ſhould not know while he lived,
that I ever had any affection for him. I ſhould avoid him as an
enemy, though he were dearer to me than my own life, nay though it
ſhould coſt me this very life, <hi>I</hi> ſhould keep, to the laſt gaſp from the
knowledge of all the earth, thoſe ſentiments which have broke forth
to that of all the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But what is then your meaning, <hi>replyed Emilia,</hi> what courſe do
you intend to take, in order to your own quiet? To dye, <hi>anſwered
the Daughter of Cicero,</hi> to dye my deareſt <hi>Emilia,</hi> if occaſion
require, and I am very much unknown to you, if you imagine, that
I think my life ſo conſiderable as not to ſacrifice it to preſerve my
reputation. But I ſhall do what lies in my power to ſtruggle with
this enemy that hath poſſeſſed himſelf of my heart, and if the
ſtrength and aſſiſtances of heaven, which I dayly implore, prove ſuch
as that I may not gain the victory, you ſhall find, <hi>Emilia,</hi> whether
I have not learned to dye, rather then be guilty of faults which might
make you bluſh for my ſake. I have acquainted you with the ſecret of
my heart, becauſe there hath not been any tranſaction there which
you have not known; but did I imagine it ſhould come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of any other perſon in the World beſides your ſelf, I ſhould think
one hour a long time to ſurvive the ſhame I ſhould conceave thereat,
and you ſhould beſtow on my death thoſe tears, which compaſſion obliges
you to ſhed, to accompany thoſe which my unhappineſſe forces
from me.</p>
                        <p>As ſhe made an end of theſe words, ſhe could keep in no longer
thoſe ſhowers of tears which fell down from her eies in abundance,
which yet hindred not, but that <hi>Lentulus,</hi> who looked on her with
attention, or rather with tranſportation, thought her ſo beautiful
in that condition, and was ſo much moved at her diſcourſes, the
grace wherewith ſhe delivered them, and the fortune that obliged
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:97242:48"/>
her thereto, that pitty; which had by degrees taken place in his
heart, was of a ſudden changed into a violent paſſion. For though
he had ſeen <hi>Tullia</hi> ſeveral times before, yet did it not raiſe in him
any inclinations for her, other than what her merit might raiſe in
all that knew her; but now in this little interval, wherein grief
appeared ſo amiable in her countenance, he became her abſolutely
devoted vaſſal, and in love with her after ſuch a manner, that he
had not the leaſt ſtrength to oppoſe it, and was not able to hear
the reaſon which ſhould have diſſwaded him from loving a perſon
whoſe affections were otherwiſe diſpoſed of, and one from whom,
either upon occaſion of that diſcovery, or out of any conſideration
of her own humour, he was in all probability never to expect any
thing. In a word, love here knew no degrees, but as ſoon as he
could be ſaid to love, he might be ſaid to do it violently, inſomuch,
that ſympathizing with her in the affection wherein he ſaw her
involved, he participated thereof ſo far, that, when he turned
toward <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> my Brother perceived his eyes were red and
big with tears. For his part, he had not been at all moved, either
at <hi>Tullia's</hi> words, or the diſcoveries of her affection, whether it
proceeded from the reſentment he had in heart againſt that Lady,
or that naturally he had a ſoul not over-ſuſceptible of love, or that
all the affection it was capable of, was already devoted to <hi>Marcia,</hi>
a Princeſſe of excellent beauty, and one to whom he ought abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of obligations. He was already deſirous to remove from
that place, when <hi>Lentulus,</hi> fearing they might be ſurpriſed, and
perceaving by the diſcourſe of <hi>Tullia,</hi> that it would trouble her
infinitely if ſhe ſhould diſcover that <hi>Ptolomey</hi> had heard her, took
him by the arm and carryed him away. They went thence as ſoftly
as they had come thither, and made ſo little noiſe, that they were
not perceaved or heard. They went out of the little Iſle, and
walked a good while ere they ſpoke one to another. <hi>Ptolomey</hi>
knew not what to ſay of that adventure, ſo much was he ſurprized
at the ſtrangeneſſe of it; and <hi>Lentulus,</hi> whoſe ſoul was wounded
by what he had ſeen, and whoſe ſpirits were in ſome diſorder, by
reaſon of his newly-conceived paſſion, could not think of words
whereby to expreſſe himſelf, and was content onely to look on
<hi>Ptolomey,</hi> in whom he could not perceive the leaſt alteration upon
that accident, and knew not, whether he ſhould, out of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of compaſſion, adviſe him to love <hi>Tullia,</hi> or out of thoſe of
his own love and intereſt, entertain him with the ſentiments he
had for her himſelf. At laſt, having taken ſome few turns; they
were juſt falling into ſome diſcourſe, when coming to the end of
a walk, that abutted upon that wherein they were, they met full
but with the two Ladies, who had left the Arbour in a manner as
ſoon as they had, and without the leaſt fear that they had been
over-heard by any one, had reaſſumed their walk. They were all
very much ſurpriſed at that meeting, and particularly <hi>Tullia,</hi> as
being the leaſt prepared for it, and the moſt concerned in it. Her
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:97242:48"/>
eyes were ſtill red with weeping, which <hi>Lentulus</hi> perceiving, and
conſequently the condition ſhe was in, could not look on her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a certain trouble and diſturbance. They were ſo neer one
another, that it was impoſſible to paſſe by without ſalutes, and
<hi>Lentulus,</hi> ſubmitting to the aſcendent which now began to govern
him, could not follow <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> who after a ſalute full of reſpect
turned aſide. <hi>Emilia,</hi> who took notice of his carriage, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting
at this time ſo much decorum, as minding the friendſhip
ſhe had for <hi>Tullia,</hi> called him, and having obliged him to turn
back; <hi>What now,</hi> Ptolomey, ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>do you ſhun the
Ladies? No Madam, replyed he, but it is not fit that the Son of</hi>
Anthony <hi>ſhould come neer the daughter of</hi> Cicero, <hi>Enmities,</hi> reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Emilia, <hi>ſhould not be eternal, and I ſhall not be friends with</hi> Tullia,
<hi>if ſhe make no diſtinction between the children of</hi> Cleopatra, <hi>and
thoſe of</hi> Fulvia, <hi>who alone wrought all the unhappineſſe of their
houſe. Both the one and the other are equally guilty by their birth,</hi>
replies <hi>Ptolomey, nay though they were innocent enough to deſerve
that</hi> Tullia <hi>ſhould wiſh them no hurt, they cannot be ſo far ſuch as to
hope for any of her converſation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This fierce young man not guilty of that tenderneſſe he was, in
civility, obliged to, would needs, out of an affected malice, repeat
the ſame words to <hi>Tullia,</hi> which ſhe had ſometimes ſaid to his
Brother, as he had heard it related; ſo that after this laſt comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he went away, and would have no further diſcourſe with
<hi>Emilia.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Tullia</hi> had not ſpoken at all, though
<hi>Lentulus</hi> had come to her, but had faſtned her eyes on the ground,
as being in ſome doubt whether ſhe ſhould approve the proceeding
of <hi>Emilia,</hi> whoſe intention ſeemed good to her, but her action
indiſcreet enough. So that her courage, and the affection ſhe had
for my Brother, raiſed no ſmall diſtraction within her; but when
ſhe heard thoſe laſt words, and ſaw him go away with ſo much
diſdain, her face was of a ſudden deprived of all colour, and grief
and vexation preſſed upon her heart in ſuch manner, that after
ſhe had, with ſome precipitation, ſaid to <hi>Emilia,</hi> that ſhe was not
well, and was not able to ſtand, ſhe fell into a ſwound in her arms.
<hi>Lentulus,</hi> whoſe eye was but too much upon her, ran to her; and
though her misfortune touched him to the very heart, yet was it
ſome joy to him to have her in his arms, while <hi>Emilia</hi> ſate down
on the graſſe, and with the aſſiſtance of <hi>Lentulus,</hi> layed <hi>Tullia</hi> by
her, and took her head upon her lap. <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> who had not had
the time to go far thence, turned about at the cry which <hi>Emilia</hi>
gave, and ſeeing, though confuſedly, what they were doing, he
ſuſpected what the buſineſſe might be, though, it is poſſible, he
might not think himſelf abſolutely the cauſe of that accident.
However, though he was not ſubject to much love, yet would he
not be awanting in point of civility, and conſequently as to that
aſſiſtance which he thought due to her ſex; ſo that when, being
come neer, he ſaw her in a ſwound. <hi>Emilia</hi> looſning her garments
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:97242:49"/>
and <hi>Lentulus</hi> in ſuch amazement, that he knew not what to do; he
ran to the next rivulet, and, having taken up ſome water in both
his hands, he brought it, and caſt it on <hi>Tullia's</hi> face. Whereupon
ſhe immediately opened her eyes, and that, time enough to ſee
the action of <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> and to perceave that it was from him that
ſhe received that aſſiſtance. I know not whether the joy or the
confuſion ſhe conceaved thereat were the greater; but being
well furniſhed, both as to courage and reſervedneſſe, ſhe betrayed
not her thoughts of it, and giving my Brother a look ſuitable to
the different paſſions ſhe was then engaged with; <hi>I receave this
kindneſſe from you,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>in requital for what I did your
Brother in the like condition; but it is enough for an enemy, and
you are too too tender of the concernments of your houſe to do me
any more.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>With theſe words ſhe turned gently towards <hi>Emilia,</hi> and ſpoke to
her ſoftly, to entreat them to depart: to which end <hi>Emilia</hi> making
ſignes to them, they went their wayes, but, after ſeveral manners;
<hi>Ptolomey</hi> with ſuch indifference, as if he had not been any way
concerned in the adventure, and <hi>Lentulus</hi> ſo moved, and ſo
diſtracted in his thoughts, that he hardly knew what he did. Being
come ſome paces thence, they met with the women that belonged
to <hi>Emilia</hi> and <hi>Tullia,</hi> whom their Miſtreſſes had left behind,
that they might walk alone, and having acquainted them with
the accident that had happened, they obliged them to go to their
Miſtreſſes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>When they were gotten a good diſtance from that place,</hi>
Ptolomey, <hi>who walked after his ordinary poſture of freedom and
cheerfulneſſe, obſerving the diſturbance</hi> Lentulus <hi>was in, as well
by his ſilence as by the ſeveral expreſſions thereof that were viſible
in his countenance;</hi> Is it poſſible, <hi>ſaid he to him,</hi> that you are ſo
much troubled at this adventure as you ſeem to be? But is it poſſible,
<hi>replies Lentulus,</hi> that you can be ſo little as your face and actions
diſcover you to be? I aſſure you for my part, <hi>ſaies Ptolomey,</hi> that
I am not troubled a jot at it, and that I look on this adventure as if
it had happened to any other body. How, <hi>continued Lentulus,</hi> hath
neither what you have heard from the mouth of <hi>Tullia,</hi> of the love
ſhe hath for you, nor yet what you have ſeen of the effects of your
diſdain on her ſpirit, raiſed no trouble or alteration in you? Not
a jot, <hi>replies Ptolomey,</hi> and beſides the averſion I had for that Lady,
I am not much taken with what is beſtowed on me upon ſuch occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
if it hath not coſt me ſomething before, ſo that I ſhall not make
any advantage of this adventure; and all that I ſhall do for <hi>Tullia</hi>
that ſpeaks any thing of obligation, is, that I ſhall not divulge it,
and that I do upon the account of diſcretion and her ſex. So that
it ſeems, <hi>ſaies Lentulus,</hi> you do not love her, nor feel any inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to do it? I do not only not love her now, anſwers <hi>Ptolomey,</hi>
but I proteſt to you, I never ſhall love her. If it be ſo, <hi>replies Lentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
I am ſome what leſſe unhappy then I thought my ſelf, that I am
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:97242:49"/>
fallen into a paſſion which I ſhould have wraſtled with while I lived,
had it been any way prejudicial to our friendſhip. And ſince you
are the deareſt of my Friends, I ſhall make no difficulty to tell you,
that being along with you into this garden, as free as your ſelf from
any love I had for <hi>Tullia,</hi> I am now fallen infinitely in love with her,
to ſo high a degree, that it is impoſſible your brother could be more.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Theſe words made</hi> Ptolomey <hi>look on</hi> Lentulus <hi>ſomewhat ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedly,
as if he could hardly imagine his diſcourſe to be ſerious:</hi>
How, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> is it poſſible, <hi>Lentulus,</hi> that in ſo ſhort a time, and by
ſo ſtrange an accident, you ſhould fall in love with <hi>Tullia</hi>'s So
deeply, <hi>replies Lentulus,</hi> that all the words I can uſe are not able
to expreſſe it, and I thought <hi>Tullia</hi> ſo beautiful in her grief, and ſo
amiable in her ſinging and diſcourſe; that my ſoul is beſtowed on
her without ever conſulting my will; I ſay beſtowed, and that in
ſuch a manner, that I am not in the leaſt hope ever to retrive it out
of her power. I know I put my ſelf to strange extremities, and
that attempting to ſerve a Lady, prevented by a ſtrong paſſion for
you, and that one that hath ſtudyed conſtancy and reſolution, ſuch as
<hi>Tullia</hi> is, I embarque for a voyage wherein I am ſure to meet with
many ſtorms; but when all is done, it is the pleaſure of my
deſtiny it ſhould be ſo, and it is not in my power to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Lentulus</hi> went on with abundance of diſcourſe to the ſame
effect, which the length of this relation obliges me to forbear
repeating to you, though it put <hi>Ptolomey</hi> into ſuch an aſtoniſhment
at the fantaſtick adventure, that he could hardly imagine it to
be real. He entreated him, ſince he was not reſolved to affect that
Lady, never to ſpeak ill of her, nor let the World know what he
did concerning her paſſion, which haply the little account and
acknowledgement he made thereof, might in time oblige her to
forget. My Brother promiſed never to ſpeak of it while he lived
to any one but to me, from whom he was not able to conceal any
thing, and engaged for me that I ſhould not ſuffer that ſecret to
take any further aire. Accordingly, he failed not to come that
very night, to give me an account of all that happened to him,
conjuring me to ſecrecy, and I could not but be amazed as well
at his relation of the love of <hi>Tullia,</hi> as that of <hi>Lentulus,</hi> whoſe
miſfortune I much bemoaned, becauſe he was a perſon of a moſt
illuſtrious birth, and very recommendable among the Romans for
his many excellent endowments. I had alſo ſome compaſſion for
<hi>Tullia,</hi> though I had no reaſon to love her, and I blamed <hi>Ptolomey</hi>
for the inflexibility of his heart; but having great reſpects for
<hi>Martia,</hi> and looking on that allyance as moſt advantageous for my
Brother and all our houſe, I was very glad not to ſee him engaged
in any other affections that might have diverted him from her.
He on the other ſide viſited her oftner than he had done before,
continuing and adding to the demonſtrations of his affection;
but with this remark, that he did all things with greater indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:97242:50"/>
and freedom of ſpirit then ſhe could have deſired, and in
ſuch manner, that his love hindred him not from minding his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
divertiſements, or diſcovering the averſion he had for mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
However, he provided againſt the day of <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s his
birth, to do for her what all the other young Romans did for the
Ladies they ſerved, and would come into the exerciſes, with the
Livery, &amp; all other demonſtrations of the engagement he lay under
to ſerve her. <hi>Lentulus</hi> did the like for <hi>Tullia,</hi> but he underſtood
that ſhe was not well, and was not likely to be preſent at the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity.
You may ſome other time have an account of what hath
paſt in the loves of <hi>Lentulus</hi> and <hi>Tullia,</hi> poſſibly not unworthy your
attention; but beſides that there is not much come to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
they are not the ſubject of my preſent diſcourſe, and my
relation is ſo long without it, that I doubt not but you will
excuſe me, if I ſay not any thing thereof.</p>
                        <p>At length, the day deſtined for the celebration of the Solemnity,
and the honour of <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s birth being come the whole Court,
all the Nobility, and the people ran to the Sights. I ſhall ſay
nothing to you of the duels fought by the <hi>Gladiators,</hi> and the
fighting of ſavage beaſts, which were the divertiſements of the
people for the morning. The reſt of the day was ſpent in things
of greater magnificence, ſuch as wherein the Roman Nobility
diſcovered their greateſt pomp and gallantry; and yet I ſhall give
you but a ſhort deſcription of it, and that out of a neceſſity that
lyes upon me to make mention thereof in my relation. There was no
place within <hi>Rome</hi> able to contain the vaſt number of people that
were to be preſent at the ſhews, and that of the perſons that were to
celebrate them. The Emperour therefore, had, without the gates
of the City, in a fair Plain upon the Tiber ſide, cauſed a vaſt tract
of ground to be rail'd in, having left two ſides free for the people,
which were bordered with an Amphitheatre of ſeveral ſteps, on
which an infinite number of people might be diſpoſed. He had
cauſed to be raiſed over againſt the entrance certain Scaffolds
covered over with rich tapiſtry, for the Ladies, the Senate, and
ſuch other perſons as were deſtin'd for thoſe places. On the fourth
ſide were diſpoſed part of the Emperours Guard, whoſe employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it was to open the railes at the entrance of the Chariots the
horſes and people that were to come in, and all that ſide was
wholly taken up by ſuch as were requiſite for that office, to avoid
all confuſion and diſturbance. The place was ſpacious enough for
the longeſt races of either horſe or Chariots, and of ſuch an
extent, as it was ſaid, that it was ſufficient for the encamping of
an army.</p>
                        <p>The firſt ſight was to be that of the Chariots, which was follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by horſe-races, and after that was a combat on horſeback, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two parties with edgeleſſe weapons, which the Romans
call <hi>Troy,</hi> and they ſay was invented by <hi>Aſcanius,</hi> the Son of <hi>Aeneas,</hi>
at his arrival into <hi>Italy.</hi> All the Chariots paſſed one after
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:97242:50"/>
another, took divers turns about the place along the railes, and
after they had been ſeen by the Emperour, the Ladies, and the
people, when the ſignal of the races was given, they were all
diſpoſed according to the order they had obſerved in coming in,
at that end of the place which was oppoſite to our Scaffold, in
expectation of the laſt ſignal at which they were to ſet forward.
They had all four horſes a-breaſt, open before, with one onely
place behind, for the Maſter of the Chariot, wherein he ſate
armed all over, having on, a head-piece, the viſour down, with a
Buckler on his left arm, and two Javelins in his right hand; and
the Chariots, the ſlaves that followed them, the cloaths that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the horſes, and all the Equipage wore the Livery of the
Ladies, as far as they were known. Upon theſe occaſions was it
particularly that the young Romans outvy'd one another to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
their inclinations; at leaſt thoſe who had no deſign to keep
them ſecret, and to that end was there a great diſtance between
the Chariots as they paſſed by, that people might the better ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the attendance of every Chariot in particular, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any confuſion.</p>
                        <p>The firſt that appeared was that of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> all glittering with
gold and magnificent workmanſhip; his attendance was noble and
full of pomp, and about his perſon, and in all his Equipage he wore
the Livery of <hi>Julia.</hi> That of <hi>Tiberius</hi> came next, not inferiour in
point of magnificence to that of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> with my characters
and colours. That of <hi>Domitius</hi> followed him, with thoſe demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations
which argued the affection he had for <hi>Agrippina.</hi> After
that came <hi>Archelaus</hi> with the colours of <hi>Antonia.</hi> Next came
young <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> very neat and gallant in his Equipage, wearing
the colours of <hi>Martia.</hi> Prince <hi>Polemon</hi> followed him with
thoſe of <hi>Marcella;</hi> and <hi>Mithridates,</hi> who came after him,
made no difficulty to have alſo thoſe of <hi>Antonia.</hi> The next
was <hi>Craſſus,</hi> with a Livery which none could gueſſe whom
it was for, and whence it was to be inferred, that his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was not to have it known. Then came <hi>Lentulus</hi> with that
of <hi>Tullia,</hi> and then <hi>Albinus, Aemilianus, Cinna, Cepio,</hi> and a
many others of the moſt Illuſtrious <hi>Roman,</hi> to the number of
fifty, it being the Emperour's pleaſure there ſhould be no more
to avoid the confuſion that might have enſued. Though <hi>Agrippa</hi>
was not of an age that made him incapable of theſe exerciſes,
yet would not the Emperour have him engaged therein, but took
him and <hi>Mecaen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>s</hi> for company's ſake, to judge of the races, and
to order the diſtribution of the prizes. And though all the Maſters
of Chariots had the viſours of their headpieces down, and were
in ſuch a poſture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if they had been ready to fight, yet were they
known as they paſſed by, as well by the perſons that were of their
attendance, as by divers other marks, ſo that it was in us to judge of
the magnificence and graceful carriage of them, which we did, and
gave our opinions thereof very freely.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="96" facs="tcp:97242:51"/>
This great number of Chariots, (which certainly was the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt
ſight in the World) had gone round about the place, and it
was thought there would not come any more, when the Liſts being
opened again, the place echoed with the noiſe of twelve Trumpets
which appeared at the entrance, and began to match a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
after the laſt of the Chariots that had paſſed before. They
were mounted on twelve excellent horſes, and their long coats
were of a sky-coloured ſtuff, which was the colour of <hi>Antonia,</hi>
all covered over with enflamed hearts, and the characters of
<hi>Antonia,</hi> in embroidery of gold; but the nobleſt and moſt ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
embroidery that ever had been ſeen at Rome. The flags
which hung at their Trumpets were full of the ſame characters.
After the Trumpets, came one after another twenty horſes, led
every one by two ſlaves, who held them in on both ſides by two
ſcarfes of the colour and embrodery afore mentioned. The horſes
were of the beſt kind of Gennets, and the proudeſt in their paces
that ever were ſeen; they had in their heads, which they lifted up
with a certain pride, great pennaches of the aforeſaid colour, and
their maines and tayles tyed up with ribands of gold and sky colour.
The bits of their bridles were enamell'd with gold, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhed
with precious ſtones, and they were covered with sky coloured
cloaths hanging down to the ground, and enriched with
the ſame embroidery of gold, and the ſame characters of <hi>Antonia.</hi>
The cloaths of the ſlaves were of the ſame ſtuff, and had the ſame
trimming. After theſe came fifty others cloathed after the ſame
manner, without any difference, and went on both ſides the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
which immediately followed the twenty horſes.</p>
                        <p>The Chariot had in it four horſes white as the very ſnow,
done with ribands, and harneſſed as the former. It ſeemed to be
all of gold, mixt with sky-colour at certain diſtances, with
double A. A's, burning hearts, darts, chains, and other em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems
of love and ſervitude. The two ſides had the form of
two Lyons, that ſeemed to have ſumitted to the yoke, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
the ſeat, and ſerved for a leaning place on both ſides. And
behind there was a Cupid made of the height of a man, whereof
the figure was ſomewhat greater than ordinary, which reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
onely on one foot behind, ſtretched himſelf out as it were to
fly, and, having the wings ſpread, covered therewith the perſon
that was in the ſeat, and ſeemed to have been put there purpoſely
againſt the injuries of the weather, and as it were a covering for
the Chariot. The ſculpture of that Cupid was admirable, his
face as handſome as the beſt Gravers could have made it, and his
wings glittering with gold and precious ſtones, which ſhined in
ſeveral places. In one hand he carried a heart upon the top of one
of his arrows, and in the other a little flag of sky-coloured ſilk,
wherein between two chains, and other marks of ſlavery, might be
ſeen theſe verſes written in letters of gold:
<q>
                              <pb n="97" facs="tcp:97242:51"/>
                              <l>I like a <hi>captive</hi> pine and ſigh;</l>
                              <l>Yet place a glory in my woes,</l>
                              <l>I'd rather own this ſlavery</l>
                              <l>Then of the univerſe diſpoſe.</l>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>All the reſt of the Chariot was open, ſo that it was eaſie to ſee
how the perſon was accommodated that was within it. He had on
a cuirats and a head-piece of gold, enamell'd with sky-colour, and
enriched, in ſeveral places with ſtones of a great value. The head-piece
was covered over with a many plumes of blew feathers,
which both backwards and on both ſides hung down to his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
But in the enamel, as well of the head-piece as the cuirats,
might be obſerved every where the characters of <hi>Antonia;</hi> and the
ſleeves and the lower part of his under-garment, which came
down ſomewhat below his knee, being interwomen with gold and
blew ſilk, were full of the ſame characters, with an excellent em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery
of gold, and his buſkins interlaced with gold and blew,
adorned with rich buckles and precious ſtones. Nor was there
any want of them, about the ſword he had by his ſide. He had
in his right hand two Javelins, with the points guilt with gold, and
in the left, a Buckler of the ſame mettal, with the edges enamel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
ſuitably to the reſt of his Armes, and enriched in the middle
with the picture of the fair <hi>Antonia,</hi> done ſo like her, that it was
immediately concluded to be the work of the moſt excellent Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Italie.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I thought it not amiſſe to give you this ſhort deſcription of him,
for that indeed we ſpent more time in looking upon him, then we
had done on all elſe that was to be ſeen, though it muſt needs be
acknowledged there was no want of ſtate or magnificence any
where. But in regard that all the reſt were known, and that there
was no means to diſcover this laſt, either by the perſons of his
attendance, or by any other mark, he drew after him, not onely
the aſtoniſhment and acclamations of the people, but alſo the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity
of all others. And yet though it was impoſſible to know
either his face or name, yet from ſome other circumſtances, that
were publick and remarkable enough, it was generally concluded
that it could be no other then the unknown ſervant of <hi>Antonia,</hi>
who ſome daies before had beſtowed on her the magnificent Galley,
who had overthrown <hi>Archelaus</hi> and <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and of whom,
under the name of the <hi>Vnknown Lover</hi> there were ſuch ſtrange
reports ſpread up and down <hi>Rome</hi> and elſewhere. It immediately
ran from mouth to mouth among the Spectators, and all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
was concerning <hi>Antonia</hi>'s ſervant, inſomuch that <hi>Archelaus</hi>
and <hi>Mithridates</hi> perceaving it, conceaved not a little trouble and
envy thereat, and could not for a certain time recover themſelves
out of that diſturbance of thoughts which that ſight had cauſed in
them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="98" facs="tcp:97242:52"/>
                           <hi>Antonia</hi> and my ſelf were not far from the Emperour, ſo that,
over-hearing all the diſcourſe which fell not onely from <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but
all thoſe that were about him, upon occaſion of this accident, there
ſpread ſuch a redneſſe over <hi>Antonia</hi>'s face, as could not be gotten
off for almoſt all that day. And though I was not thereupon
thrifty of my diſcourſe to her, and earneſtly entreated her to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
her thoughts to me upon that emergency, yet was it
a long time ere ſhe would as much as open her mouth to make me
any anſwer. <hi>Siſter,</hi> ſaid I to her, <hi>was it not ſhrewaly gueſſed of me
ſome daies ſince, that your unknown ſervant was a perſon admirable
as to point of invention and magnificence, and do you not find that
in whatever he undertakes, he eclipſes all that is done by others? In
troth,</hi> I <hi>cannot forbear ſpeaking for him, and to tell you, that</hi> I <hi>have
conceived an extraordinary good opinion of him. Antonia</hi> was in ſome
uncertainty, whether ſhe ſhould diſcover her diſpleaſure at the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
or make her diverſion of it as others did: but what thoughts
ſoever her diſturbance might inſpire her with, yet could ſhe not
but entertain in her ſoul a certain joy at the advantages of a perſon
that loved her, though he did it contrary to her intentions, and the
reputation he acquired, whether ſhe would or no, for his gallantry
and magnificence.</p>
                        <p>But not long after, ſhe had much more reaſon, for in fine, Siſter,
(not to tyre you with a relation of all that paſſed that day, which it
were impoſſible to relate to you fully) I ſhall think it enough to
tell you, that this unknown perſon having provided all things for
that day, with all the care and prudence imaginable, and furniſhed
himſelf with the beſt and fleeteſt horſes that could be had, carryed
away all the prizes, as well for the horſe-races as the Chariots,
leaving behind him at a diſtance all that ran with him, and in that
combat on horſeback called <hi>Troy,</hi> he behaved himſelf with ſo much
addreſſe and vigour, and did all things with ſuch an admirable
grace, that he alone drew after him the general acclamations of the
Spectators. In fine, he was by the Emperour himſelf declared
Conquerour, how partial ſoever he might be for <hi>Marcellus,</hi> and
received the prizes, which he came and laid at the feet of <hi>Antonia,</hi>
bending the knee, and bowing to her with a ſubmiſſion that ſpoke
him her ſlave. <hi>Antonia</hi> bluſhing for ſhame and vexation, though
haply ſhe was not much diſſatisfied at the adventure, did, by the
commandement of <hi>Octavia,</hi> receive them, and immediately after,
the Unknown Lover mounting one of the beſt of his horſes, rid
him before us with ſuch a grace, and ſeemed to us to be of ſuch a
noble preſence, and ſo well to become the bow of the ſaddle, that
we could not forbear admiring him. A while after, he went in
among the reſt, and, taking his time, and making his advantage of
the diſorder and confuſion they were in, he went out of the Liſts,
and got away with as much ſpeed as could be. His Chariot, and
Equipage were gone long before, for he had given order, that as
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:97242:52"/>
ſoon as the Chariot-races were over, all ſhould withdraw, while
the people were taken up with the other exerciſes, wherein he was
to make uſe of no more then the horſe he rode on.</p>
                        <p>By this precaution had he taken a courſe, that thoſe who were
not concerned in his affairs, ſhould not follow the perſons that
were of his attendance in order to diſcover him, as it might have
been the deſign of divers. But as he retired himſelf, how circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
ſoever he might be, he could not eſcape the eyes of the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<hi>Mithridates,</hi> who fully ſatisfied it could be no other than the
ſame Rival that had caſt him to the ground, took a reſolution
to follow him to the worlds end, and never to leave him till he
had diſcovered who he was, or that the other had made him ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for the injurie he had received from him. He went out of the
liſts ſoon after him, and perceiving he made all the ſpeed he could
away, he followed him at a diſtance towards certain houſes, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he ſaw he intended, and are diſtant from the City about fifty
or ſixty ſtadia. <hi>Archelaus,</hi> perceiving that <hi>Mithridatts</hi> was gone,
preſently imagined the occaſion of his departure, and it being no
leſſe his concernment then the others to be acquainted with his
Rival, would needs follow him, and took his courſe that way which
he was told he had taken.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time <hi>Mithridates</hi> was gotten far enough before, and
having obſerved that his unknown Rival turned towards a little
Wood on the left hand, he made after him with all the ſpeed he
could, and reached it in a manner as ſoon as the other. It was with
no ſmall difficulty that he overtook him, nor indeed had he done
it, had his Rival ſuſpected any thing of his deſign; but ere he
perceived any ſuch thing, he was gotten ſo neer him, that all he
could do was to pull down the viſour of his head-piece, which he
had raiſed up to take a little more air, and he did it time enough
to prevent <hi>Mithridates</hi> from knowing him. Having ſo done, he
would have kept on his way, but <hi>Mithridates</hi> made a ſhift to get
before him through the trees, and oppoſing his paſſage; <hi>Hope not,</hi>
ſaid he to him, <hi>to get away this time again, till I have known thee,
and poſſibly till thou haſt made me ſatisfaction for the many injuries
thou haſt done me.</hi> The Unknown Lover, troubled at this ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conter,
was in ſuſpence for ſome minutes what anſwer to make
him; but at laſt, perceiving what extremity he was reduced to,
and thinking that, beſides the care he ſhould take to diſguiſe his
voice, the head-piece would contribute ſo much thereto, as to
make him undiſcernable by the other. <hi>Mithridates,</hi> ſaid he to him,
<hi>thou haſt little reaſon to be ſo obſtinate in purſuing a man that is not
thy enemy, but may become ſuch through thy importunate perſecution
of him. If thou art my friend,</hi> replies Mithridates, <hi>thou ſhouldſt
not conceal thy ſelf from me, and if thou art not,</hi> I <hi>little fear thy
diſpleaſure, after the diſgraces</hi> I <hi>am fallen into by thy means.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As he uttered theſe words, he oppoſed his paſſage more than
before, and held up againſt him the point of a Javeline he had in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:97242:53"/>
his hand. The Unknown Lover would have avoided fighting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diſcovering himſelf, but perceaving it impoſſible to do it;
<hi>Thou wilt haply have occaſion to remember,</hi> ſaid he to him, <hi>what vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
thou doſt force me to, and if thou receave any inconvenience
thereby, thou haſt no body to blame but thy ſelf.</hi> With theſe words
they charged one another at the ſame time, and having broken
their Javelins on their Bucklers upon which they received them,
they drew their ſwords, and many blows were dealt on both ſides.
But my little experience in matter of Combats, permits me not to
give you all the particulars, and therefore ſhall onely tell you, that
the Unknown Lover finding in one paſſe, <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s
horſe in ſomewhat an unſettled poſture, ran his own a-breaſt
upon him, and ſo overturned both him and his maſter to the
ground.</p>
                        <p>The Unknown Lover thought himſelf freed by the fall of
<hi>Mithridates,</hi> and would accordingly have kept on his way, when
there coming before him <hi>Archelaus; Stay,</hi> cried he to him, <hi>having
ſeen</hi> Mithridates <hi>fall, thou haſt done but half thy work, unleſſe thou
conceive me leſſe concerned to know thee then</hi> Mithridates. This
ſecond ſtoppage put the Unknown Lover out of all patience,
though he very much eſteemed the perſon of <hi>Archelaus,</hi> and
ſeeing divers others coming from the City, he conceived
he had but little time to looſe, and accordingly without
any further conſultation, he fell upon <hi>Archelaus,</hi> who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
him with blows as to weight, not much inferiour to thoſe
he dealt himſelf. They fought for a good while on equal termes;
but at laſt, the Unknown Lover perceiving the perſons, he had
ſeen before, coming neerer and neerer, runs to <hi>Archelaus,</hi> and
laying hold of him, he put on his horſe, which was one of the beſt
in the World, to force him out of the ſadle, and ſo free himſelf
by his fall, as he had done before by that of <hi>Mithridates.</hi> And
certainly, he put ſo much ſtrength to it, that he did what he deſired
in ſome part, and drew <hi>Archelaus</hi> out of the ſadle upon the
crupper, whence he ſlipped down to the ground: but <hi>Archelaus,</hi>
having, as he fell, gotten hold of the other by the head-piece,
held him with ſuch force, that he broke the chin-pieces of
it, and taking it with him, his enemies head was naked and
diſarmed. Upon which <hi>Marcellus, Ptolomey, Craſſus,</hi> and divers
others being come into the place, ran to the two Combatants, and
in the ſight of all thoſe perſons, as alſo of <hi>Archelaus</hi> and <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi>
who were gotten up, the face of the unknown Lover was
ſeen, and known to be that of <hi>Druſus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Livia,</hi> and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to <hi>Tiberius.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The aſtoniſhment of the two Princes that had been worſted by
him, of</hi> Marcellus, Ptolomey <hi>and the reſt, was not ordinary, when
they found</hi> Druſus <hi>to be the Unknown Lover of</hi> Antonia, <hi>who
had ſerved her, without diſcovering himſelf, with ſo much gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:97242:53"/>
and good-liking, and if</hi> Archelaus <hi>and</hi> Mithridates <hi>were
troubled that they had met with ſo powerful a Rival; they were
in ſome meaſure comforted as to their diſgrace, becauſe it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the hands of a Prince, whoſe valour was known to all the
World.</hi> Druſus <hi>was in a little trouble and diſorder to ſee himſelf
diſcovered, as thinking he had not come to that point he ſhould
have done ere he had been known; but perceiving the misfortune
to be incapable of any remedy, he generouſly reſolved to endure
it, and turning towards Prence</hi> Marcellus <hi>and</hi> Ptolomey, <hi>who ſtood
neer him:</hi> Moſt Illuſtrious Princes, <hi>ſaid he to them,</hi> I crave your
pardon for the ſurprize and ſtratagems I have uſed towards the
Princeſſe your Siſter, and the offence I have committed againſt you
by ſerving her without your knowledge. Had I thought my ſelf
worthy that glory, I ſhould not have had any recourſe to artifice;
but how mean ſoever I may be as to point of merit, I cannot but hope
from the goodneſſe of Prince <hi>Marcellus,</hi> for whoſe ſake I cheerfully
quitted all the pretentions I had for <hi>Julia,</hi> that he will grant me, out
of an exceſſe of favour, that which I durſt not preſume to deſire of
him, before I had in ſome ſort obliged him to love me, by the ſervices
it was in my thoughts to do him. And from Prince <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> a perſon
I have ever infinitely eſteemed, I do expect, he ſhould not oppoſe me
in the deſign I have abſolutely to ſacrifice my whole life to the ſervice
of the Princeſſe his Siſter.</p>
                        <p>To this effect was the diſcourſe of <hi>Druſus,</hi> which when he had
done, he expected the anſwer of the two Princes with that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
which he might well derive from the friendſhip they had
expreſſed towards him for ſome time before. Tis true, <hi>Druſus</hi>
was a Prince of ſo great merit, that he was infinitely eſteemed by
all that were of his acquaintance; and from the time that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi>
was reconciled with him after the duel they had fought for
<hi>Julia,</hi> having diſcovered his excellent endowments, as well in his
converſation, as the earneſtneſſe he obſerved in <hi>Druſus</hi> to purchaſe
his affection, he had conceaved more reſpects &amp; friendſhip towards
him than any other among the Romans, &amp; preferred no man before
him in his inclinations, but only <hi>Coriolanus.</hi> On the other ſide, <hi>Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>'s
Fortunes were ſo conſiderable by reaſon of the authority of
<hi>Livia,</hi> and the intereſt his own worth had juſtly gained him with
<hi>Caeſar,</hi> that neither <hi>Marcellus,</hi> nor <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> nor any of the other
Friends of <hi>Antonia</hi> could wiſh her a match that were more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous.
They accordingly ſtudied not long for the anſwer they
were to make him, and <hi>Marcellus</hi> ſpeaking for both, out of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
that what he ſaid ſhould be confirmed: <hi>Prince,</hi> ſaid he to
Druſus, <hi>we have ſome reaſon to be diſpleaſed with you; but it is
onely for the little relyance you have had in our friendſhip, and the
eſteem we have for you. But that you ſhall hear more of another time;
and therefore in the interim, ſince you have thought</hi> Antonia <hi>worthy
your affections, I ſhall tell you that I think her happy, and very much
honoured in the inclinations you have for her; that I queſtion not
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:97242:54"/>
but that</hi> Caeſar, Octavia, Alexander, <hi>wherever he may be, and</hi> Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomey
<hi>are of the ſame mind, and that, for my part, if in the deſign
you have upon her, you need the aſſiſtances of a Brother that hath
ſome power with her, I proffer you all you can deſire or expect from
me, as being one that endeavours nothing ſo much as the acquiſition
of your friendſhip, and next to that, the continuance of it while he
lives.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>What <hi>Ptolomey</hi> ſaid to <hi>Druſus,</hi> was to the ſame effect, whereat
this Prince was ſo much ſatisfied, that he could not expreſſe his
joy without a certain confuſion. After he had diſcovered his
reſentments thereof to both, as much as he poſſibly could, he comes
to <hi>Archelaus</hi> and <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and made his excuſes to them, as
to what was paſt, in the moſt obliging manner that could be.
Theſe two Princes felt ſo much grief within, that they could not
think of any conſolation, but not ſo much for the diſgrace of
their falls, as for that their ill fortune had raiſed them ſo dreadful
a Rival, and the words they had heard from <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mey,</hi>
from which, together with the confidence they were in that
<hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Octavia</hi> would declare for <hi>Druſus,</hi> they could not
but infer that the little hope which they had conceived in the
courſe of their affections, would come to nothing. But, however
they were burthened with grief, they received the civilities of
<hi>Druſus</hi> as they ought, and on their ſide craved his pardon for their
indiſcretion, and whatever they attempted againſt him, while they
knew him not.</p>
                        <p>I ſee, Siſter, you are deſirous I ſhould contract this relation, ſince
it is indeed of an exceſſive length, and therefore, I ſhall onely tell
you, without inſiſting too much on particulars, that, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the reſiſtance that <hi>Druſus</hi> made thereto, <hi>Marcellus</hi> and
<hi>Ptolomey</hi> would needs have him, immediately, and in that very
poſture preſented to <hi>Antonia,</hi> and that <hi>Druſus</hi> having oppoſed it
for ſome time out of the fear he was in to diſpleaſe her, at laſt
was prevailed with to come along with them, and followed them
to the City, and ſo to the Emperours Court, where all the moſt
eminent perſons about it were aſſembled, and diſcourſing of the
Unknown Lover of <hi>Antonia.</hi> They were yet ſpeaking of him
when <hi>Marcellus</hi> comes into the room, leading in <hi>Druſus</hi> by the
hand; and it was before this Illuſtrious Aſſembly, that <hi>Marcellus,</hi>
having preſented him to the Emperour, and <hi>Octavia,</hi> brought him
to <hi>Antonia,</hi> and, having diſcovered him to her for the Unknown
Lover, who had given her ſuch gallant-like expreſſions of his love,
and that in ſo extraordinary a manner, entreated her to entertain
him, as a Prince that had devoted himſelf to her ſervice, and
whoſe inclinations for her were an honour to all their houſe. The
whole Aſſembly was nothing but applauſes and acclamations at
the ſight and diſcovery of <hi>Druſus;</hi> and being a perſon generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
all were glad to hear that it was he who had done ſuch noble
things for <hi>Antonia,</hi> and cryed out they were worthy one another,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:97242:54"/>
and that it was a couple the beſt matched of any in the World.
The Emperour conceived an extraordinary joy at it, <hi>Livia</hi> was
well pleaſed with the good choice her ſon had made, and the
Emperour and ſhe together, joyning with <hi>Marcellus,</hi> (having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
the firſt civility to <hi>Octavia</hi>) addreſſed themſelves to <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
intreating her to entertain <hi>Druſus</hi> into her ſervice, and give
him leave, by open hoſtility, to take in that heart which he would
have ſurprized by ſtratagem.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Antonia,</hi> ſome what troubled at the adventure, found it ſome
difficulty to recover her ſelf out of the diſorder ſhe was in; and
though it be certain that it was ſome joy to her to ſee the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Lover changed into <hi>Druſus,</hi> who was the perſon of all
the Romans, into whom ſhe had moſt reaſon to wiſh him changed,
yet was ſhe ſtill vexed at the artifice he had uſed toward her, and
could not of a ſudden overcome the reſentment which was riſen
thereof in her mind. However ſhe had a command over her ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
moderation, and, having raiſed <hi>Druſus,</hi> who was on his knees
before her, ſhe onely told him that there was a conſonancy between
her will and thoſe of the perſons to whom her birth had made her
ſubject; and that, (I mean her moderation) ſhe made uſe of not
only for that day, but was the ſame for a many that followed; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that <hi>Druſus</hi> hath found it true, that all the demonſtrations
of love that may be have no influence on her ſpirit, and amount to
no more than the complyance ſhe had for the diſpoſal of <hi>Octavia.</hi>
He was at laſt received into her ſervice with the joy and acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of all, inſomuch, that <hi>Antonia,</hi> having ſince had a greater ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with his excellent endowments (if ſhe were incapable
of Love) hath at leaſt ſubmitted to the commands laid on her by

his firſt letter, as alſo what courſe he had taken to conceal himſelf
from all the World, as well that day that he beſtowed on her the

ſome few dayes he had pretended affairs of conſequence in the

<hi>Cleopatra</hi> and <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> of the fidelity and infidelity of

him for his cruelties, and having reſolved to be <hi>Coriolanus</hi>'s,

WHile the two Princeſſes were thus engaged in
diſcourſe, <hi>Megacles.</hi> whole eare was equally
divided, between that of having them in ſafe
cuſtody, to obey the commands laid upon him
by his Maſter, and that of affording him the
beſt attendance he could, to ſatisfie in ſome
ſort his own inclinations, which were ever directed to vertue,
omitted nothing of what he thought might be expected from him
in order to either of theſe obligations. And whereas on the one ſide
it was ſome diſſatisfaction to him to be employed to ſecure them,
out of the fear he was in to incenſe a Prince who was not wont
to pardon any thing, ſo on the other, he with no leſſe joy laid hold
on thoſe occaſions which preſented themſelves, to diſcover unto
them the repugnance which he ſtruggled with to diſpleaſe them.
Being therefore obliged not to part from the ſhip, he had ſent
<hi>Ariſtus</hi> betimes in the morning to ſee what news he could learn
of the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and this man being returned, had brought
him word, that the King would infallibly come aboard the veſſel
that very day: and that though he were in ſuch a poſture as topoint
of health, that he could not well undertake ſuch a voyage
without ſome danger, yet had he abſolutely reſolved to venture
it, out of the great deſire he had to ſee <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and the fear he
was in of looſing ſo noble a prize.</p>
                     <p>Megacles, <hi>having received this intelligence for certain, began to
diſpoſe all things in the veſſel in order to his entertainment; and
having underſtood that the Princeſſes were deſirous to be alone,
he, out of the great reſpect he had for them, would not ſo much
as come neer their Chamber, and was content only to give notice
to one of the women that belonged to</hi> Cleopatra, <hi>that he deſired
that notice might be ſent him, when the Princeſſes were pleaſed
that he ſhould waite upon them, and when they would have any
thing brought to dinner. That done, calling to mind the Unknown
Perſon, whom the day before he had reſcued from the devouring
waves, and of whom he had conceaved a marvailous good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he would needs give him a viſit, and being come into the
chamber, where he had left him a bed, he found that he made a
ſhift to get on his cloaths; but that afterwards, being much troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the great quantity of ſalt water he had drunk, he had
been forced to caſt himſelf again on the bed they had aſſigned him,</hi>
Megacles, <hi>as ſoon as he came in, cauſed a little window to be ſee
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:97242:57"/>
open to give a little more light to the chamber, and having by that
advantage of light made freſh obſervations of the good counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and hundſomeneſs of the Unknown, he was now much
more ſurprized at him then the day before, and could not look
on him, but with a certain admiration. The other, who with
much ado knew him again, and reflected on the aſſiſtance he had
received from him, as alſo on the converſation they had had toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the more than ordinary pains and earneſtneſſe he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in the ſaving of his life, entertained him with abundance
of kindneſſe, and gave him ſome occaſion to ſee through the clouds
of his melancholy, that though he had little love for the good
office had been done him, yet had he abundance of acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for his good intentions. Adde to that, that all his behaviour,
all his geſture, nay indeed all things ſeemed to be ſo great, as
if there had been in him a conjunction of ſweetneſſe and modeſty
with a noble and majeſtick aire, that, notwithſtanding all his ill
fortune,</hi> Megacles <hi>felt in, himſelf abundance of inclinations to
reſpect him, as he would do the perſon of</hi> Artax<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s <hi>himſelf. After
he had ſate down by him, that he had felt his pulſe, and had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
of him ſome account of his health, the unknown perſon
aſſuming the diſcourſe with a ſigh, which by its depth ſeemed to
have come from the bottom of his heart;</hi> My health, <hi>ſaid he to
him,</hi> is but in too good a poſture compared to that of my Fortune;
but whatever it may be, you ſee that I do not any way oppoſe the
return of it, and that I have kept the promiſe I had made you not
to attempt any thing againſt my life, while I ſhall be in your power.
And for that very reaſon, <hi>replies Megacles,</hi> you ſhall continue in it
as long as I can poſſibly keep you, and I ſhould find it no ſmall difficulty
to ſuffer you to leave us, if I had the leaſt imagination that you
forſook us, to go and ſeek out death. When I conſider what poſture
my life is reduced to, <hi>replyed the Unknown, I</hi> think death to be the
onely happineſſe I either can or ought to hope, and yet ſince I have had
that of ſeeing you, having made ſome reflections on the things you
told me yeſterday, on the ſtrange manner whereby I was delivered out
of the very jaws of death, contrary to all probability, and other
circumſtances of my misfortunes, I concluded, that I ought not to put
a Period to my own life, before I had done all that lay in my power
to ſerve a perſon on whom I had beſtowed it; ſince that in all
likelihood ſhe ſtands in need of it, and that it is not impoſſible but
that by ſome one of thoſe extraordinary accidents that happen to
me, but ſhe may yet receive it. Out of this conſideration, and
upon the account of this obligation, rather than out of any hope, or
remainder of love that <hi>I</hi> have for my life, had I taken my cloaths,
and would have begged your leave to be gone; but, to deal truely with
you, the body was not able to follow the motions of the ſpirit, and
perceiving that all the ſtrength I could muſter was hardly able
to bear me up, and conſequently far from putting that in execution
which I had intended, I was forced to ly down again, till ſuch time as
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:97242:57"/>
I ſhall have recovered it a little better, as I poſſibly may ere
this day be quite paſſed. The Gods have the praiſe of this good
reſolution, <hi>replyed Megacles,</hi> and I ſhall think my ſelf obliged to
give them thanks while I live for the opportunity they have furniſht
me with to prevent the effects of your deſpaire, ſince that by this
very demurre we have made to it, we may haply have abſolutely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
and diſmiſſed it. Alas, alas, <hi>replyed the afflicted perſon,
with a ſigh,</hi> how little acquaintance have you with my Fortune!
And how far would you be from that opinion, had you but once an
account of my misfortunes! I ſhall know them when you ſhall think
good, <hi>replyed Megacles;</hi> but I ſhall not deſire it of you, till ſuch
time as your own inclination ſhall inſpire you to give it me: for, the
little time I have known you conſiered, I have conceived ſuch a
reſpect for you, as permits me not to deal with you as I happly ſhould
with ordinary perſons. That compaſſionate ſentiment, which you have
for the miſerable, <hi>replyed the Unknown,</hi> you rather derive from
your own vertue, then any thing you might have obſerved in my
perſon, which is onely the mark of Heavens indignation, and a ball
continually toſſed and bandyed by the inconſtancies of Fortune. And
therefore aſſure your ſelf, that the opinion I have conceived, and the
reſentment I have, of this compaſſion you expreſs towards me, ſhould, no
doubt, prevaile with me to make a diſcovery of my ſelf to you rather
than to any other perſon, if I might thereby convince you of the eſteem
I have for you, and were I not obliged to ſecrecy out of other conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
then what concern my ſelf. You may judge of the truth I now
tell you, by the poſture wherein you have ſeen me, and I doubt not but
you are ſatisfied that he who contemns his life, as I have done, hath
nothing to fear, as to himſelf, that might hinder him to diſcover
himſelf. Till ſuch time then that I am at that liberty, I ſhall only
tell you, that whatever incenſed heaven, and the indeprecable deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
may have ever executed that were moſt inſupportable, on a great
number of miſerable perſons, is fallen in ſuch manner on me alone, that
neither the times of our Fathers, nor yet our own could ever afford
ſuch another example. And whereas you have ſeen divers perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
unfortunate through the loſſe of dignities, friends, eſtates, the
affection, nay and the perſons too of all that they could love in this
World; you have in me a draugt of all theſe, but I draught, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times greater than your imagition can repreſent it to you.</p>
                     <p>I have ever bin of opinion, <hi>replyed Megacles,</hi> that your misfortunes
were indeed extraordinary, and your ſoul hath appeared to me ſo great
in the expreſſions I have ſeen thereof, that I immediately inferred it
impaſſible as to ordinary ones. And yet I ſhall preſume to tell you
that in the courſe of the World there have been ſeen revolutions
ſtrange enough to raiſe up and encourage the moſt cruſhed hopes, and
that ſeveral perſons out of the most dreadful abyſſes of misfortunes,
have as it were in an inſtant flown up to the higheſt pitch of happini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and glory. Who could have promiſed <hi>Marius</hi> in the midſt of his
miſeries that glorious change that happened in his condition? and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:97242:58"/>
who could have put him into ſuch a hope, as that out of the fenne where
he had hid himſelf for the ſafety of his life, and out of the dungeon,
wherein he had been expoſed to the mercy of thoſe that were ſent to
murder him, he ſhould, within a few daies after, enter <hi>Rome</hi> in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
and be raiſed up to the ſame height of greatneſſe whence he
had before been caſt down?</p>
                     <p>You find it no ſmal difficulty, <hi>replied the Unknown perſon,</hi> to meet
in all our ages but with this one example, to prove the poſſibility of
mans return from misfortune to loſt felicities; but you may eaſily find
an infinite number to demonſtrate how eaſy it is to fall from thrones
into chains, and from fame and happineſſe into ſhame and miſery. So
many Kings in <hi>Rome,</hi> drawn after Chariots, loaden with chains, and
diſpoſed into priſons, and among the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves, the great
<hi>Pompey,</hi> and the deplorable <hi>Anthony,</hi> furniſh us with examples of it
ſufficiently dreadful. A man may endeavour to ſtruggle with Fortune
by the aſſiſtance of vertue and a great courage, but not expect the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of her favours, when ſhe hath once withdrawn them by her incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy:
for this envious goddeſs is much more inclined, and ſubject to
pull down what ſhe had once built up, then to raiſe up what ſhe had once
brought to ruin. Beſides, there are ſome happineſſes, &amp; ſome misfortunes
in our lives that have no dependance on fortune, and wherein ſhe is very
little concerned: and whereas ſhe hath no power over mens inclinations,
it were in vain for thoſe, whoſe greateſt unhappineſſe ſhould conſiſt
in the loſſe of an affection, which they thought extreamly precious,
to expect the returne of it from Fortune, and it were fruitleſſe for
them, any way to rely on her aſſiſtance. <hi>Sylla,</hi> who ſeemed to have
made an allyance with her, and who might well attribute more to her
indulgence then he could have done to his own vertue, enjoyed the
continuance of her favours to the end with a more then ordinary
conſtancy; and that Greek Captain, whom ſhe in his dreams, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
with Cities beſieged in nets, acknowledged her ever for an
aſſiſtant goddeſſe. But neither of theſe two great examples ever
ſought any other happineſſe, or feared any other misfortunes then
thoſe which are deriveable from her Empire, and ſhe might wel be their
principal divinity, ſince ſhe diſpoſed of all thoſe things that could raiſe
in them either fears or deſires, and conſequently could make them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fortunate or unfortunate: but for my part, who, with all ſhe could
take from me, have loſt what ſhe cannot reſtore me to, alas, to what
god can I addreſſe my ſelf? Or where ſhall I find either aſſiſtance or
compaſſion, when both heaven and earth have conſpired againſt me?</p>
                     <p>Theſe words fell from him with ſuch an expreſſion of ſadneſſe,
and yet he had uttered them with ſuch a grace, and in ſo obliging
a manner, that <hi>Megacles</hi> had not onely all the pitty that could be
for him, but alſo all the admiration. He therefore omitted nothing
of what he could ſay to him, that he thought might give him
any comfort, and having, before he would ſtir out of the place,
cauſed victualls to be brought in, he would not leave him till he
had eaten ſomething. Which done, out of a fear he might be
troubleſome to him, and a conſiderantion that reſt would do him
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:97242:58"/>
much good, he left him, and went about thoſe things which his
charge obliged him to look after, and particularly to take order
for the bringing of victualls and other neceſſaries from <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
in order to their voyage, wherein he was to be ſo circumſpect as
that the veſſel might not come thereby into any danger of being
diſcovered. In theſe employments and ſome other which he had
had, the morning and better part of the day was ſpent; ſo that at
laſt perceiving it was very late, and that the Princeſſes had not
called for any thing, he went to their chamber door, and ſent to
entreat them that they would be pleaſed ſomething might be
brought them to dinner. It was much about the time that the
fair <hi>Cleopatra</hi> had made an end of her long relation; inſomuch,
that upon the ſollicitation of <hi>Megacles</hi> and their Women, they
gave way that ſomewhat ſhould be brought them in, and took a
little nouriſhment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>About the end of their repaſt, the Princeſſe</hi> Cleopatra, <hi>who
ſeemed to have ſlumbered her ſelf into a deep recollection, gave
a ſudden ſtart, and was as it were in a great trouble and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance;
but a little after recovering her ſelf, and fetching a ſigh
from the bottom of her heart;</hi> Good God, Siſter, <hi>ſaid ſhe to Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſa,</hi>
how true is that which I told you this morning concerning the
force of our imagination, and how certain is it that the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
which I ſtill have in my ſoul of the unfaithful and unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Son of <hi>Juba,</hi> hath imprinted ſuch ſtrong idea's of him in my
mind, that if his countenance appears not to my eyes, his voice I
am ſure ſmites my ears! Even at that very moment that you might
have obſerved ſome alteration in my countenance, I thought I had
heard him diſtinctly very neer me, and ſeveral times this day, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the time of the diſcourſe I have entertained you with, this ſame
deluded imagination of mine brought that ſound to my ears, and
had allmoſt put me out in my relation. I could not have believed
that for an unfaithful perſon there ſhould have remained ſuch ſtrong
impreſſions in my mind: but alas, how unconſtant ſoever he may have
been, he is haply dead for my ſake, and by the bloud he hath ſhed by
defending us againſt the Barbarians, he hath haply expiated part of
the offence he hath committed againſt.</p>
                     <p>In troth, Siſter, <hi>replyed Artemiſa,</hi> whether he hath loſt his life
in our cauſe and aſſiſtance, or that it hath been the pleaſure of the
gods to preſerve him, as it is not impoſſible but it may be ſo, I cannot,
for my part, imagine he ſhould be unconſtant: and what hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to me in order to his juſtification, hath had ſuch an influence
over my belief, that I am ſtill of the ſame mind, and cannot forbear
telling you, that I think him very innocent. Might it pleaſe the
gods he were ſuch, <hi>replyed the afflicted Princeſſe,</hi> and were it the
pleaſure of the ſame Gods that I had purchaſed the innocence you
attribute to him, with the beſt part of my blood. <hi>But having pauſed
a while,</hi> O vaineſt of wiſhes, <hi>continued ſhe,</hi> the pure effect of the
tenderneſſe of my own heart! What advantage can I derive to my
ſelf from his innocence? If he were deſtined to dye, ſhould it not

be ſome ſatisfaction to me that his infidelity hath happened before
his death, that ſo I might be capable of a comfort which I ſhould
never have hearkened unto, had he dyed conſtant? And if on the
other ſide he be living, when I conſider the wretchedneſſe of my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
and the captivity I now am in, which haply will never ſuffer
me to ſee him again, am I not much leſſe unfortunate in that I have
only my own miſeries to bewayle, then if, it being ſuppoſed he were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
to me, I ſhould be obliged to have a reſentment of his as much
as if they were my own? And yet all this notwithſtanding, <hi>conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſhe with a ſigh, (proceeding eyther from weakneſſe, or that
ſhe had ſome reaſon for it)</hi> I cannot repent me of my wiſh, and I
ſhould be glad, though haply it might coſt me my life, he were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant
to me.</p>
                     <p>I am very much of your mind as to that point, <hi>replied Artemiſa,</hi>
and accordingly make it out of all queſtion, that of all the miſeries
which it is in the power of Fortune to force upon us, there are not any
but are more ſupportable to a heart ſenſible of a tender affection, then
thoſe that proceed from that very affection, as being ſuch as are all
directly levelled againſt the ſame heart that is wounded by them.
There are in our ſoules ſeveral degrees of tenderneſſe, for they are not
equally ſenſible of the happineſſes and unhappineſſes of this nature
as of thoſe that proceed from other cauſes; nay I dare affirm, that
while they have this impreſſion, they have no other conſideration of
theſe later, than that they were aſſiſtances or obſtacles to thoſe which
we look on as purely real and eſſential. Which granted, I can without
any difficulty believe, that amidſt all the misfortunes which the juſt
indignation of heaven may ſend upon us, the unconſtancy and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
of the perſon beloved, is the moſt indigeſtible, and moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
and inſupportable, and, by a certain violence of aſſault, ſtorms
that strength of mind which might poſſibly hold out againſt all other
unhappineſſes. And you muſt on the contrary acknowledg, that amidſt all
the miſeries through which our inexorable deſtinies will needs force
us, the faith and conſtancy of the perſon we love, raiſes up our ſpirits
into ſuch a height of conſolation and enjoyment of our ſelves, that
during ſuch time as we make a ſtrong reflection thereupon, we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
in an apathy as to all the reſt, all our ſenſibility being taken up
by the other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Ah, Siſter, <hi>replies Cleopatra, fixing her eies on</hi> Artemiſa, <hi>with
a languiſhiag, but withall an amiable look,</hi> how true is all you
have ſaid, and conſequently how have you fully convinced me,
that I am the moſt unfortunate perſon in the World, and that
you are not unhappy at all, ſince that being expoſed to all thoſe
misfortunes, which you have mentioned, and particularly to that
which you acknowledge to be moſt inſupportable. I am depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of that dear conſolation which might in ſome ſort alleviate
them, and which the gods have been pleaſed to leave you.</q> 
                        <q>I
muſt indeed confeſſe, <hi>replyed Artemiſa,</hi> that I ſhall never think
my ſelf abſolutely miſerable while my <hi>Alexander</hi> is conſtant to
me: but I hope you are in the ſame degree of happineſſe, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:97242:59"/>
cannot forbear telling you over and over, that I find more reaſon
and probability in the circumſtances that make for <hi>Coriolanus,</hi>
then in thoſe that make againſt him, And you ought to
give me ſo much the more credit, Siſter, for that I ſpeak on the
behalf of truth contrary to my own intereſt, and againſt my
own quiet.</q> 
                        <q>Your intereſt, Siſter, <hi>ſayes Cleopatra to her,</hi> and what
intereſt have you I pray in the fidelity of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> other then
what our friendſhip obliges you to have?</q> 
                        <q>I am ſo much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in it, <hi>replies Artemiſa,</hi> that <hi>Coriolanus</hi> is not much more him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
And this you might eaſily have imagined, though I have
not ſpoken any thing to you thereof, ſince it is apparent
enough, that, if, according to the preſumption you have of the
inconſtancy of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> you ſhould once baniſh him your heart,
the King my Brother, whoſe priſoners we are, and who loves you
well enough as you have had ſufficient try all, might conceive a
little more hope from your neglect and oblivion of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi>
then if you ſtill afforded him a place in your affections. And if
that alteration ſhould once happen, what fortune were compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
to mine, ſince I might hope to be two ſeveral wayes your
Siſter, and to poſſeſſe my <hi>Alexander</hi> without any danger, and
that with my Brothers conſent? And yet you ſee, Siſter, that
this intereſt could not prevaile with me to ſpeak contrary to
what ſeemed to me to be truth, and the innocency of <hi>Coriolanus;</hi>
and all the fortune might happen to me ſhould it be otherwiſe;
could not force me to diſguiſe my thoughts or betray the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I have for you.</q>
                     </p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Your deportment in this buſineſſe, <hi>replies the Daughter of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi>
ſpeaks you a Princeſſe nobly born, full of goodneſſe and
vertue, and I conceive my ſelf obliged to you for this particular
demonſtration of your friendſhip, much more then for all the
others you might have given me. But ſince you have thought fit
to make this overture to me of your ſelf, give me leave, Siſter,
to entreat you, by whatever is deareſt to your thoughts, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere
in that good intention, and I beſeech you, by all the good
inclinations you have for me, never to aggravate the miſeries of
my captivitie by ſuch diſcourſes as haply the King your Brother
will oblige you to entertain me with on his behalf. I ſhall not tell
you, that, by his horrid cruelties as well towards my Brother
as your ſelf, he hath rendred himſelf unworthy, both of the
affection he expects from me, and the aſſiſtance which he hopes
you may afford him. Nor ſhal I adde to that, as I very well might,
how that by the ſame cruelty, whereof I have been acquainted
with the abominable circumſtances, both from the relations of
<hi>Alexander</hi> and your own, he hath raiſed in my heart the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
horrour that may be for him, whence it comes that I look on
him rather as a Tyger than a great King. But I ſhall not ſtick to
tell you plainly, that, though his life were not ſtained with any
baſe or reproachable action, though his manners and diſpoſition
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:97242:60"/>
wanted not that mildneſſe and affability I ſhould require, though
his perſon were more than ordinary amiable, and that to his ſingle
Crown he could adde the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> he ſhould never have
any part in this heart, which I have once beſtowed, and never
can do a ſecond time. <hi>Coriolanus</hi> hath had the firſt ſpoiles of it,
and ſhall carry them with him to the grave; whether he be living
or dead, conſtant or inconſtant, he onely ſhall have that advantage.
And if, by his infidelity, I am diſpenſed from the affection which
I ought to have continued to the very laſt gaſp, had he perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in his; or am, by his death, diſengaged, as to him, of a
friendſhip, which it is needleſſe to obſerve towards the ſhades,
there is nothing can diſengage me from my ſelf, that is, from
what I impoſed upon my ſelf, when I firſt ſubmitted to that inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
affection, and conſequently, nothing can ſet my ſoul at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
in order to a ſecond choice, or into a condition to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
any new impreſſion of love. Tis enough that the great
<hi>Cleopatra</hi> hath once given way to love and been taken with the
great perfections of the moſt amiable among men; but the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
which I might find for my former weakneſſes, would not
haply be accepted for the latter. Expect not therefore from me,
<hi>my deareſt Siſter,</hi> what I could not obtain of my ſelf, for my ſelf,
though I ſhould pretend a greater intereſt it ſhould be ſo,
then that which you repreſent, and imagine that there cannot
be any ſelicity hoped from an affection contracted by ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
waies. To do you what ſervice I can with the King
your Brother, and to oblige him to treat you more civility, I ſhall
conceale part of my reſentments, and the averſion I have for
him; and therefore you ought to be ſatisfied with me, when
you ſhall ſee me do that for you which I ſhould never endure
to do one minute formy ſelf, and conſider the violence I do my
ſelf for your ſake, as no ſlight demonſtration of my Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Artemiſa</hi> gave <hi>Cleopatra</hi> many thanks for the promiſe ſhe had made
her to force her inclinations upon her account, and begged her
pardon for what ſhe had ſaid concerning her own concernments, and,
in requital, made a proteſtation to her, that ſhe would never ſpeak
to her more on the behalf of the King her Brother, and that ſhe
had two great an eſteem for thoſe reſolutions of fidelity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
which ſhe had taken, ever to be guilty of any deſign to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
them.</p>
                     <p>Thus were they engaged in diſcourſe, when of a ſudden they
heard a very great noiſe in the ſhip, and not long after, that it was
upon occaſion of the Kings coming into it. What lectures ſoever
they might have read one to another of conſtancy, they both grew
pale, and were a little ſtartled at this news, and looking one upon
the other without ſpeaking, they were at a loſſe as to all reſolution;
yet ſo as that there might be ſome difference in their thoughts,
and if the ſoul of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> was burthened with a more lively
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:97242:60"/>
grief, that of <hi>Artemiſa</hi> was ſubject to more fear. At laſt, <hi>Cleopatra,</hi>
whoſe courage was greater than that of <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> was the firſt
that broke forth into any reſolution, and looking on <hi>Artemiſa</hi>
with a countenance that ſpoke ſomething of more confidence,
<hi>Siſter,</hi> ſaid ſhe to her, <hi>let us rely on the aſſiſtance of Heaven in our
misfortune, and in the mean time ſummon together all our vertue,
and let us not forget the reſolution we have taken.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Artemiſa</hi> had not the power to make her any anſwer, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
had ſhe time, for immediately thereupon their chamber-door
being opened, the firſt thing they ſaw was the dreadful counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the King of <hi>Armenia.</hi> He was ſomewhat of a pale com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
and lean'd, as he came along, upon one of his men; but
his paleneſſe was diſpelled at the ſight of that object by which he
was enflamed, and he made a ſhift to forget all his weakneſſe to
get near <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> who at his firſt coming in was riſen from the
place where ſhe ſate. <hi>Artaxus</hi> ſaluted her with abundance of
reſpect, and <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> who was glad to continue him in that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and laoth to force him to thoſe extremities, which ſhe
might juſtly fear from a man ſo violent, returned him, though
with a ſad and ſerious countenance, what was due to <hi>his</hi> quality
from a Princeſſe of <hi>hers.</hi> Before he ſpoke to <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> he caſt his
eyes on <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> who trembling for feer, had her eyes fixed on
the ground, not having the confidence to look him in the face.
The fear and confuſion he perceived her to be in, added not a
little to his joy; but however, he thought fit to ſpeak to <hi>Cleopatra,</hi>
before he addreſſed himſelf to the other, and looking on her with
a countenance wherein he endeavoured to moderate ſome part of
his natural fierceneſſe, and to take off ſomewhat of that which
was moſt dreadfull in him; <q>Madam, <hi>ſaid he to her,</hi> my love forces
me to waite on you, though the juſtice of the gods hath made
you mine to be diſpoſed as I pleaſe; even in the late accident
you might have taken notice of ſo much, and you ought to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
your own reſentments of it, out of a conſideration of the
blood I have loſt to preſerve you.</q> 
                        <q>I ſhall never believe, <hi>anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Cleopatra,</hi> that it is to be attributed to the juſtice of the gods,
that a free perſon, and one of my birth, ſhould become your
priſoner, without any war, and contrary to the Laws of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
You might have obſerved no leſſe your ſelf in this very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
wherein it hath coſt you ſo much bloud, and it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
they ſhould approve the unjuſt violence you do me, if
they are, as it is believed, the aſſertors and patrons of Juſtice
and innocence.</q> 
                        <q>What violence, <hi>replies Artaxus,</hi> can he be ſaid
to do you who caſts himſelf at your feet? Or wherein does he
violate the Law of Nations, when he gives you a full right and
abſolute power over both his heart and his crown? Do you
in agine that this injuſtice is of the ſame kind with thoſe which
the gods puniſh, and are you not afraid to incenſe them your
ſelf, by entertaining ſo much averſion and animoſity againſt a
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:97242:61"/>
King that adores you, and is ready to dye at your feet?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having ſaid theſe words, he turned towards <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on her with a little more mildneſſe than ordinary, by reaſon
of the preſence of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> whom he knew to have a horrour
for his cruelties: <q>Well, <hi>Artemiſa, ſaid he to her,</hi> you ſee after
what manner Heaven hath proſpered your deſignes, and how it
hath approved that the Daughter of <hi>Artabaſus</hi> ſhould forſake
her Brother and her King, to run away with the Son of <hi>Anthony.</hi>
                        </q>
                        <q>My Lord, <hi>replies Artemiſa, endeavouring to recover her ſelf a
little,</hi> though my affection was, I muſt confeſſe, very great to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Alexander,</hi> yet was it not ſuch as ſhould have obliged me
to forſake you to follow him, could I have taken any other
courſe to have ſaved his life, which you would have taken from
him, and he ſhould have loſt for my ſake.</q> 
                        <q>This makes nothing
for your juſtification, <hi>replies Artaxus;</hi> but you do not ſtand
much in need of any, having found ſuch a ſanctuary in the
Princeſſe <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> The power ſhe hath over me diſarms the
indignation I have againſt you, and I have no hatred for <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
ſince I adore <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> In a word, your deſtiny is in her
hands, and I ſhall not onely pardon you the offence you
have committed againſt me, but I ſhall furrher conſent to
your marriage with <hi>Alexander,</hi> if <hi>Cleopatra</hi> will be but
mine.</q>
                     </p>
                     <q>
                        <p>It is not impoſſible, <hi>replies</hi> Cleopatra, <hi>not ſtaying for any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
from Artemiſa,</hi> but that we may find other means to get out
of your power; and if they faile us, we will follow thoſe reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
which the gods and our own courage ſhall inſpire us
with. In the mean time, be not flattered with ſo fond a hope,
as that <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould tamely ſuffer you, in his own dominions,
and almoſt in his arms, to carry away a Princeſſe that is one of
his houſe, and under his protection; but on the contrary, aſſure
your ſelf, that by ſuch a contempt of his authority you may
ſtirre up ſuch a fire as may ſet your kindome all into a
flame.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>Caeſar,</hi> I queſtion not, <hi>replies Artaxus,</hi> will remember, that my
Father hath alwayes ſerved him, and dyed in his cauſe, through
the cruelty of your Father, who was his implacable enemy. I
my ſelf, in my younger years, have drawn my ſword of his ſide
againſt <hi>Anthony,</hi> and if the children of his enemies are not more
conſiderable to him then thoſe of his Friends and Allies, he will
not think there is more injuſtice in the carrying away of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi>
then in that of <hi>Artemiſa. </hi>
                        </q> 
                        <q>
                           <hi>Artemiſa</hi> hath not been carryed away,
<hi>replies</hi> Cleopatra, ſhe hath onely fled away from your wrath,
after ſhe had ſaved my Brothers life. It was her obligation to
preſerve it, becauſe it was for her ſake that he had expoſed it to
that ignominious death, which you had intended he ſhould
ſuffer. And ſo after ſhe had thus acquitted her ſelf towards a
Prince who was not unworthy of her, ſhe was content to follow
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:97242:61"/>
him and participate of his fortune in order to the ſafety of her
life, which ſhe could not hope to have ſecure with you after
thoſe examples of cruelty which ſhe had ſo freſh in her me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</q>
                     </p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Well, Madam, <hi>replyed the King of Armenia,</hi> whether <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
carryed away <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> or <hi>Artemiſa</hi> carryed away <hi>Alexander,</hi>
it matters not; this is certain, that I received the affront, in the
very heart of my dominions; and that a Prince of the quality of
<hi>Alexander</hi> had no ground in the World to go and remain incog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nito
in the Court of a King, whom he knew to be his enemy,
whether it were to gain the affections of his Siſter, or out of any
other deſign which he might have had; and that there is not
any Prince in the World, by whom he had not been ill trated
upon ſuch an account. But though this reaſon, and the others I
have already alledged of the intereſts and the ſervices of our
houſe, ſhould amount to nothing with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> I am now to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to another power than his, and ſince I have ſubmitted my
ſelf to yours, I ſtand in greater fear of your indignation than
<hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>This he ſeconded with ſome other diſcourſe, after which, he
deſired leave of her to ſit down, by reaſon of his wounds which
had weakened him very much, and were not a little troubleſome
to him. <hi>Cleopatra</hi> laughed in her ſleeve at this pretended reſpect,
and yet was not a little pleaſed to keep him in that humour, out
of a fear he might break forth into diſorder, and accordingly not
much care what violences he put in execution. Nor indeed was
the deſign of <hi>Artaxus</hi> any other; it being impoſſible that his fierce
and cruel nature ſhould ſpend it ſelf long in fruitleſſe complyances!
But he thought it his beſt courſe to diſſemble, while he was yet
in a condition to fear all things, and out of that conſideration
would not make uſe of his power, till ſuch time as he were come
into his own Kingdom. In the interim, he had reſolved to do all
that lay in his power to humour <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and omitted no humble
ſervices or ſubmiſſions, to make her forget, if poſſible, the averſion
ſhe had conceived againſt him. He would needs have the ſhip to
hoiſe up ſaile at that very inſtant, though his Chirurgeon had made
it appeare to him, that the ſea was prejudicial to his wounds, and
indeed he had on the other ſide ſome reaſon to fear he might be
ſurprized upon that coaſt, by thoſe that were ſent out in queſt of
<hi>Cleopatra.</hi> He conceived, and that not without probability, that
he had not eſcaped ſo long, had it not been for the little likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
there was that thoſe who had carryed away <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> ſhould
ſtay ſo neer <hi>Alexandria.</hi> And indeed it was out of that very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
that thoſe who went in their purſuit, as well by ſea as
by land, had gone the farther from the place where the fact was
done. Beſides the veſſel was ſo hidden by a rock, which in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
covered it, that on the land ſide it could not any way be ſeen;
and to prevent all ſuſpicion from the ſea of its being that veſſel
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:97242:62"/>
wherein were the Princeſſes, order had been taken, that neither
they nor any belonging to them, ſhould at any time appear upon
the deck.</p>
                     <p>With this precaution, and theſe favourable circumſtances, <hi>Artaxus,</hi>
not conceiving himſelf ſecure, would needs have been gone thence
at that inſtant, when a wind, contrary to his deſignes, and conſonant
to the wiſhes of the Princeſſes riſes at the ſame time; but a wind
ſo contrary to the courſe they were to take, that it was thought
impoſſible to get out of the river, while it blew with the ſame vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
it had begun, nay there was ſome fear, that if they went out
of the place where they were, wherever they had caſt anchor,
it could not be ſo private as the other. The King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated
at this, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ailed at the gods and fortune for this misfortune,
but after he had tormented himſelf for ſome time to no purpoſe,
he was forced to give way, and to ſuffer the remainder of the day
and the night following to paſſe away in expectation of a change.
In the mean time he was retired into a little chamber which they
made a ſhift to dreſſe him up in the veſſel, where he thought fit to
take his reſt for ſome time and have his wounds dreſſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The two Princeſſes had ſoon notice of this favourable change
of the wind, by</hi> Camilla, <hi>who had heard it from</hi> Megacles, <hi>and this
wench, who was indeed very much eſteemed by her Miſtreſſe as
well for her vertue, as her many excellent qualities, after ſhe had
told them the news with a countenance full of joy and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe,</hi>
Madam, <hi>ſaid ſhe to her,</hi> let us not deſpaire of Heavens
aſſiſtance, and ſince it begins to declare it ſelf for us, let us believe
that its aſſiſtance will prove abſelute and effectuall, and that it will
never forſake ſuch great and vertuous Princeſſes in ſuch a misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
as you are in. I am very much inclined to hope it, <hi>my dear
wench,</hi> replies the Princeſſe, and we ought to joyne our prayers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to beſeech the gods to direct thoſe to the place where we are, who
in all probability run up and down to our reſcue. There is no doubt
to be made, <hi>added the fair Artemiſa,</hi> but that <hi>Alexander</hi> will ſearch
the World over in our purſuit; but he goes far enough to find us
while we are ſo neer the place where he loſt us; tis ſo much the more
our unhappineſſes, and it will never be believed that thoſe who carryed
us away ſhould make a ſtay at the gates of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> I am of your
mind, <hi>replies Cleopatra,</hi> but theſe reflexions availe us nothing,
and all that lies upon us to do, is, to expect with patience what
it ſhall pleaſe the ſoveraign diſpoſers of our deſtinies to do
with us.</p>
                     <p>While they were diſcourſing thus in their Chamber, <hi>Artaxas</hi>
kept ſilence in his, unleſſe it were when that from his bed he gave
orders for his voyage. <hi>Megacles</hi> gave him an account of that
admirable unknown perſon whom he had relieved, and had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
into his bed, and ſpoke of him in ſuch manner as raiſed in
the King a deſire to ſee him, upon the extraordinary relation
which the other had made concerning him. But in regard that
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:97242:62"/>
                        <hi>Megacles</hi> told him, that he was too weak and too much caſt down
to be brought before him, in a time that he ſhunned the light,
and hated life it ſelf, he reſolved to give him a viſit in the place
where he was, after he had taken an houres reſt on his
bed.</p>
                     <p>Thus was he employed, when he ſees coming in to him, <hi>Ariſtus,</hi>
and with him ſeaven or eight men ſufficiently well armed, with
fierce and ſavage countenances, and, in the head of them, he who
ſeemed to be their chief, and had as little kindneſſe in his looks as
any of them, though he were very pale, and ſeemed to have laien
in lately of ſome great ſickneſſe. The King at firſt ſight could not
call the man to mind, not onely by reaſon of the alteration wrought
in him by his ſickneſſe, as the change which ten or twelve years
had made in his countenance, it being ſo long ſince he had ſeen
him. But <hi>Ariſtus,</hi> aſſuming the diſcourſe, and preſenting him to
the King, <hi>This my Lord,</hi> ſaid he to him, <hi>is the famous</hi> Zenodorus,
<hi>whom you have ſometimes ſeen in your own Count and in your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
before the accidents that have happened to him, had obliged him
to coaſt up and down the ſea, where he hath made himfelf ſo dreadful.
I have met him, and known him again by a very ſtrange chance, and
in regard that I knew your Majeſty hath had a great eſteem for him,
and conceiving that his ſervices and thoſe of the men that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
him, (perſons much better acquainted with theſe ſeas than any
of your ſubjects) might prove advantageous to you in the condition
you are now in, I thought ſit to bring him along with me, out of a
confidence that your Majeſty would take it well at my hands.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>With theſe words <hi>Zenodorus</hi> continuing the diſcourſe, made
himfelf fully known to the King, and <hi>Artaxus,</hi> who had not onely
ſeen him many years before both in his own Court, and alſo in the
King his Fathers, but had alſo a particular eſteem for him, and, at
his coming to the Crown, had aſſiſted him in his marriage with one
of the handſomeſt Ladies in all <hi>Armenia,</hi> called him to mind very
well; and having entertained him with much kindneſſe, he aſſured
him of his joy to ſee him again, and of his aſſiſtances as far as he
were able, upon what account ſoever he might deſire them. <hi>Zeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi>
returned him thanks with much reſpect, and proffered to
ſerve him in his own perſon, and promiſed the ſervices of thoſe
men that accompanied him with all fidelity. <hi>Artaxus,</hi> diſcovering
his weakneſs by the paleneſs of his countenance, and having known
him to be a perſon of a conſiderable rank, cauſed him to ſit down,
and after ſome words expreſſing the reſpects he had for him;
<q>Zenodorus, <hi>ſaid he to him,</hi> if you are aſtoniſhed to ſee me upon
this coaſt, and in the poſture wherein you find me, I am no leſſe
my ſelf to meet you in that condition wherein you appear
to me. About the time of your departure from <hi>Armenia,</hi> while
yet I was but young I heard thouſands of ſtories of you, and have
underſtood ſince, that for theſe eight or ten years you have
ſcowred the ſeas with ſeveral conſiderable ſhips of war, have
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:97242:63"/>
taken many prizes, fought divers memorable fights, and grew
dreadful beyond all the Pirates that found ſo much trouble to the
Great <hi>Pompey.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Tis very true, my Lord, <hi>replyed the Pirate,</hi> that I have done
part of what you ſay, and that I have been feared as well in
the main ſea, as in that where we now are. I was, not many
dayes ſince, the richeſt of all the Pirates, and had gotten toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
riches enough, to forget all reſentment for what had been
taken away from me to beſtow on <hi>Herod;</hi> but Fortune hath
eaſed me of a great part of them. The late tempeſt, which lay
ſo heavy on this ſea, diſperſed ſome part of my ſhips, the reſt
have been taken by the Praetor of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as I have received my
ſelf upon this coaſt, a thruſt through the body, which left little
hopes of life behind it, and yet I have with much ado recovered
it, and by a miraculous aſſiſtance am brought into the condition
wherein you now ſee me.</q> 
                        <q>What you tell me, <hi>replyed the King of
Armenia,</hi> I am not onely aſtoniſhed, but much troubled at, and
if ever we come into <hi>Armenia</hi> again, I will furniſh you with thoſe
ſupplies which you ſhall conceive neceſſary to reſtore your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to the poſture it was in before. But in regard I have heard
a many ſtrange and wonderful things of you, and that without
any order or dependence, I ſhould be very glad to underſtand
from your ſelf the accidents of your life, ſuch as are of greateſt
conſequence as may beſt ſuit with a ſhort diſcourſe, if it may
be done without any inconvenience to you.</q> 
                        <q>I ſhall be no leſſe
ſatisfied, my Lord, <hi>replyed Zenodorus,</hi> to give your Majeſty
that demonſtration of my obedience and reſpects, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the paleneſſe which is ſo viſible in my face, and proceeds
meerly from the great quantity of bloud which I have loſt, I feel
no inconvenience that ſhall hinder me from giving you a relation
of my adventures, which were not haply worth your Majeſty's
attention, were it not for one accident, which, being very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
hath accordingly made no ſmall noiſe in the World.</q>
With theſe words he came ſomewhat neerer the bed, and ſate in
the place where the King had commanded him, and having cauſed
his men to leave the room, <hi>Megacles</hi> received them, and lodged
them with the others that were in the veſſel; ſo that having, by
a little reſt, and ſome minutes of ſilence prepared himſelf for the
diſcourſe he was to make, he began it in theſe terms.</p>

HISTORY
Of the Pirate
ZENODORUS.</head>
                        <p>I Shall not be ſo diſ-ingenious as to deny, that in the life I
have led for theſe eight or ten years, I have been forced
to do many actions full of impiety, injuſtice, and cruelty;
that I have violated all manner of laws, and committed
all manner of crimes: nay, that by the conſtant practiſe of
them, I have contracted ſuch a habit of evil, as I ſhall
haply find it no ſmall difficulty to reform my ſelf of. But I would
withall, if poſſible, gladly perſwade your Majeſty, that a great
part of the miſchievous inclinations which are grown ſo powerful
within me, are rather the conſequences of my croſſe Fortune
than the effects of my own nature, and that, if the misfortunes
that have happened to me ſince my departure from <hi>Armenia</hi> had
not exaſperated my diſpoſition, and corrupted my manners, I
ſhould, as I had been born with great inclinations to vertue, have
continued in the ſame eſteem and reputation that I was in when
your Majeſty was pleaſed to honour me with more than ordinary
favours and kindneſſes. I ſhall contract the diſcourſe of my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
as much as I can, as well becauſe I am unwilling to abuſe
your attention, as that conſidering the condition your Majeſtie is
in, it were very unſeaſonable for me to ſpin out any over-teadious
relation.</p>
                        <p>Your Majeſty hath hertofore underſtood that I was born in the
Frontieres of <hi>Judaea,</hi> where the Fortunes of my Father were ſuch,
that through the affluence thereof he had the means to purchaſe
the eſtate of <hi>Liſanias,</hi> which was a ſmal portion of that Country
endued with ſoveraign power, and without appeal to any other
Monark than the Emperour. <hi>Liſanias</hi> had poſſeſſed it as ſuch for a
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:97242:64"/>
long time; but at laſt, having, for certain weighty conſiderations,
exchanged it for ſome other eſtate which my Father had, and
ſome monies he had gotten together in the ſeveral employments
he had gone through in the wars, my Father became the peaceable
Lord of it, and I by that means came into a rank which rendred
me the more conſiderable among my neighbours. I ſpent the firſt
ſallyes of my youth in the Armies, and through the natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
I ever had to the wars, I gained therein ſome reputation.
I was in that of <hi>Anthony</hi> againſt <hi>the Parthians;</hi> and being meerly
a Souldier of Fortune, and not minding Factions, I followed the
children of <hi>Pompey,</hi> againſt <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> and among other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.
I was at that famous ſea-fight that happened between <hi>Menas</hi>
and <hi>Menecrates.</hi> That war receiving a Period by the ruine of
young <hi>Pompey,</hi> I ſought out new emploiments elſewhere, viſited the
Courts of divers Kings, and at laſt came to yours. You were then but
about 15 or 16 years of age, and it was not long after the taking
of the King your Father. He honoured me very much with his
kindneſſes; but he being ſhortly after taken by <hi>Anthony,</hi> I had, in
thoſe attempts which, young as you then were, you made to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
his liberty, and afterwards to revenge his death, the honour
to follow you, in a very conſiderable employment in your Cavalry;
and I was ſo happy as to have it from your own mouth, that you
were ſatisfied with my ſervices, and accordingly received thoſe
preſents, and acknowledgement from your liberality which I have
had reaſon to celebrate ever ſince.</p>
                        <p>But beſides the inclinations I immediately conceived for a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
and a grateful Prince which engaged my ſtay in your Court
longer than in all the reſt, another thing that detained me there
was the beauty of <hi>Eliſena.</hi> I ſhall not need tell your Majeſty,
who remembers it well, as having ſeen her, that that Lady was one
of the greateſt ornaments of your Court, that by her birth ſhe was
one of the moſt conſiderable, and that in point of beauty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert,
there was none comparable to her. A man cannot well ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
any thing more amiable or more excellent than her face, but
the advantages of her mind were no leſſe admirable, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of her vertue was generally known through the whole
Court of <hi>Armenia.</hi> Thouſands of perſons ſighed for that beauty,
of which number, I had no ſooner ſeen her, but I became one.
My love encreaſed from day to day, till at laſt, that paſſion became
as violent in my ſoul, as ever it had been in any, though the moſt
poſſeſſed by it. I entertained her with all the demonſtrations I
could of it, with reſpect, earneſtneſſe and aſſiduity; but ſhe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be little moved thereat, and diſcovered very little reſentment
for all thoſe expreſſions of love which ſhe received from all the
reſt who made their addreſſes to her. She was endued with a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
which nothing could ſhake, and was ſubject to a modeſt kind
of ſeveriry, which was proof againſt all paſſion. Her inflexibility
at that time drew dayly complaints from my mouth, and ſighs from
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:97242:64"/>
my breaſt; but if I was troubled at the ſmall ſucceſſe of my
own ſufferings, I had ſtill this comfort left me, that the Fortune of
my Rivals was in no better a poſture than my own, and that ſhe
ſeemed not to incline to any choice, other than that which ſhe ſhould
be adviſed to by thoſe to whom ſhe ought her birth.</p>
                        <p>But, to be ſhort, my Lord, (why ſhould I abuſe your patience,
by acquainting you with things that you know?) your Majeſty
was pleaſed to employ your authority on my behalf, you ſpoke
your ſelf for me both to <hi>Eliſena</hi> and her Friends. Inſomuch, that
about the ſame time, news being come that my Father was depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this life, and that I was abſolute Lord of that little eſtate
which he had dyed poſſeſſed of as a ſoveraign Prince, your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
was pleaſed to further my intereſts, made appear the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of my allyance, and, to the confuſion of all my Rivalls,
though they were your own ſubjects, I carryed away the fair <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſena</hi>
and married her. The Nuptials were ſolemnly celebrated in
<hi>Artaxata,</hi> and I had gotten into my poſſeſſion that beauty for
whom I had ſuffered ſo much, and in the poſſeſſion whereof I
found much more ſweetneſſe than I had imagined to my ſelf.
Alaſſe! can I reflect on theſe things without dying, and, though
my mind be grown brawny by reaſon of the accidents I have run
through, and the barbarous employments wherein I have ſpent
my life, Can I reſiſt the reſentment they ſhould produce in me?
I became poſſeſſor of <hi>Eliſena,</hi> and with her of all the excellencies
both of body and mind, that can be wiſhed in one ſingle perſon.
Nay, what is contrarie to what ordinarilie happens, the poſſeſſion
encreaſed my love, and through the more particular knowledge
that I had of my <hi>Eliſena,</hi> I diſcovered a many excellent qualities
which I had not obſerved before in their full luſtre. After I had
made ſome ſtay in <hi>Armenia,</hi> I took leave of your Majeſty, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
and carryed away my deareſt <hi>Eliſena,</hi> that ſhe might take
poſſeſſion with me of that little eſtate which my Father had left
behind him. I was there received as their ſoveraign, and began to
lead the moſt pleaſant and delightful life that could be imagined.
Thus far, my Lord, hath my life been known to you, thus far was
it innocent.</p>
                        <p>Now may your Majeſty be pleaſed to underſtand what hath
happened to me ſince, and to have ſo much goodneſſe for me as to
charge my adverſe Fortune with ſome part of my crimes. In my
little retirement with my <hi>Eliſena,</hi> I knew not what meant the leaſt
diſturbance from abroad, and enjoyed all imaginable felicity at
home. My government, though of no great extent, was ſuch as
I was content with, and though it were envyed by <hi>Herod,</hi> who was
too powerful a neighbour for me, yet with the aſſiſtance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of ſome others, I could make a ſhift to maintain my own,
the love I had for <hi>Eliſena</hi> having had ſuch an influeuce over me,
that I had given over all thoughts of the wars, to which I had
before ſacrificed all my inclinations. My amiable <hi>Eliſena,</hi> though
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:97242:65"/>
ſhe had marryed me purelie out of the compliance ſhe had for the
commands of her Friends, yet had ever after ſo much accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
her affections to her dutie, that ſhe had an extraordinary
love for me, aſſoon as ſhe was cenvinced that ſhe ought to love me.
Accordingly might it in a manner be ſaid that we were inſeparable,
for that at all hours of the day, whether we ſtayed in the chamber,
or went a walking, or a hunting, whither I carryed her ſometimes,
and in all manner of divertiſements, <hi>Zenodorus</hi> was never ſeen
without his <hi>Eliſena.</hi> Heaven it ſelf, I fear me, envyed our felicity:
or, it may be, I was not born for that pleaſant kind of life, and
thoſe who know me at this day, would find it no ſmall difficulty to
imagine, I could ever ſpend my time as I did then.</p>
                        <p>The firſt year of our marriage was not yet run about, when,
among thoſe perſons whereof our little Court conſiſted, I took
notice of a young man latelie come thither, for ſanctuary, as he
ſaid him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>elf, againſt certain enemies that were more powerful than
himſelf, who had forced him to leave thoſe places where he was
born, and who, having been very courteouſly entertained among
us, ſet up his ſtaff there. He was called <hi>Cleontes,</hi> and this I may
truely ſay of him, that of all the men I ever met with, I never ſaw
a handſomer, or a more gentile perſon, in all his actions, nor a more
amiable in all that appeared outwardly of him. Suitably to theſe
good endowments, he immediately inſinuated himſelf into the
affections of all the World, in ſo much, that there was no diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement
appointed between perſons of either ſex, but the amiable
<hi>Cleontes</hi> was invited thereto. All the World courted him, all the
World ſpoke well of him, and all the World were extreamly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to oblige him. He very pleaſantly received thoſe demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of kindneſſe and friendſhip which were rendred him: and
though he ſeemed not to be above eighteen years of age, yet did
he diſcover ſuch prudence and conduct in his behaviour, as is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in perſons of a far greater age. Yet was this particularly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in him, that, ſlighting ordinary perſons, nay indeed many
Ladies, by whom he was not a little courted, he enjoyed himſelf
in no other converſation, but that of <hi>Eliſena,</hi> whom he accordingly
honoured with his conſtant attendance. In ſo much that at laſt
he got a haunt of viſiting her ſo often, that he was in a manner
perpetually in her company. And whereas it was none of the moſt
inconſiderable perfections of <hi>Eliſena,</hi> that ſhe was admirable in
matter of diſcourſe, and that <hi>Cleontes</hi> was infinitely pleaſant in that
kind alſo, they paſſed the beſt part of their time away with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of mutual ſatisfaction. Among all the reſt that perceived it,
I took notice my ſelf of the great kindneſſe and familiarity that
was between them, but at the firſt looked on it without the leaſt
diſturbance, and out of the extraordinary opinion which I had
of the vertue of <hi>Eliſena,</hi> I not onely harboured not the leaſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
of them, notwithſtanding all the complyances, ſervices, and
conſtant addreſſes which <hi>Cleontes</hi> had for her, but alſo took notice,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:97242:65"/>
without the leaſt worm of jealouſie, that <hi>Eliſena</hi> looked very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably
on him, and diſſembled not the pleaſure ſhe took in his
company beyond what ſhe did in that of divers other perſon that
came to ſee her.</p>
                        <p>Several moneths were paſt and gone in this manner, before ever
I conceived the leaſt ſuſpicion of the demonſtrations of friendſhip
that paſt between them; and though I was indeed of opinion that
their familiarity was greater than there ought to have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a perſon of the quality of <hi>Eliſena,</hi> and a man of the age
and beauty of <hi>Cleontes,</hi> yet did I attribute their weakneſſes to
their youth, and the friendſhip which <hi>Eliſena</hi> naturallie had for
perſons of good pleaſant wits. In a word, their manner of beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
made greater impreſſions on other mens minds then it did on
mine, and among the many perſons that conceived an ill opinion
thereat, there happened to be ſome indiſcreet enough to act the
part of the unlucky crow, and to bring me the tidings of my own
unhappineſſe. One above all, a perſon I very much credited,
egged on by an imprudent zeal, came to me on a day, and pump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
not without ſome difficulty, as I could perceive, for words
wherein to dreſſe his expreſſions the more modeſtly; <hi>My Lord,</hi>
ſaid he at laſt, <hi>is it poſſible your voluntary blindneſſe ſhould be ſuch
as muſt reduce your moſt faithful ſervants to a neceſſity of giving
you thoſe diſcoveries of their fidelity which they cannot do without
regret and violence to themſelves? Or are you reſolved not to open
your eyes to ſee what is done againſt you, while it is yet in your
power to remedy things by mild and gentle courſes, and that evils are
not come to their extremities? Obſerve my Lord, after what manner</hi>
Eliſena <hi>and</hi> Cleontes <hi>live together, and ſpare me the confuſion it will
be to me to tell you what follows.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This was the diſcourſe of that indiſcreet perſon, which yet had
this effect upon me, that I could not have been more caſt down,
had I received a mortal wound. However I did what I could to
ſmother the reſentment I conceived at his words, and thought it
enough to tell the men, that we ought not to paſſe our judgement
ſo lightly of a thing that might be innocent; that I was confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of <hi>Eliſena's</hi> vertue, and if, through the pardonable eruptions
of youth, ſhe had been too familiar with, and too liberal of her
company to <hi>Cleontes,</hi> I could not thence ſafely infer it proceeded
out of any unjuſtifiable deſign or intention. This I ſpoke to him
with a countenance wherein yet he might have obſerved ſome
part of the effect of his own diſcourſe, and, having diſmiſſed my
intelligencer, I would be the more at liberty to make reflections
on the knowledg he had given me of my own misfortune. It began
to magnify in ſuch maner to my apprehenſion, that my ſoul for ſome
minutes was as it were in a tempeſt, and my mind over-caſt with
ſuch clouds as darkened all its former light, the better to diſpoſe
it to receive melancholy and fatal impreſſions. All that before had
ſeemed ſo innocent to me, preſented it ſelf now to my thoughts
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:97242:66"/>
under another form, and calling to mind all the occaſions upon
which I had obſerved too great familiarity between <hi>Eliſena</hi> and
<hi>Cleontes,:</hi> I was aſtoniſhed at my own blindneſſe or rather inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,
and upon that came to my memory a hundred circumſtances
which I condemned all as criminal. O ye gods, how did this fatal
diſcovery eat into my heart, to make a place there for the greateſt
grief it could be capable of! And what deplorable effects did that
ſelf-tormenting paſſion immediately produce there? This black
impreſſion wrought a kind of Metamorphoſis in me, inſomuch that
I was become quite another man than what I was ſome daies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Being thus convinced of my want of circumſpection, and
conſequently of any misfortune, I railed at Fortune, I quarrelled
with heaven, and I took any occaſion to diſcover my affliction. <hi>Is
it poſſible,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>that one that is ſo dear to my heart, this great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of vertue and tonjugal love hath ſo ſoon turned bankrupt as to
all vertuous inclinations, and loſt all the affection ſhe had promiſed
me? Or if ſhe never were vertuous, nor had any real affection
for her Husband, is it poſſible ſhe ſhould be ſo well read in the art of
diſſimulation as to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>conceale it from a mans knowledge with ſo much
artifice for ſo long time? How, can that</hi> Eliſena, <hi>to whom I had
abſolutely ſacrificed my heart, that</hi> Eliſena, <hi>for whoſe ſake onely I
love my life, prove unconſtant to me, and it may be, diſhonour me?
O inexpreſſible cruelty of my deſtiny, againſt which it cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
my courage ſhould be able to reſcue me! O Heaven! O Fortune,
what reſolutions would you have me to take? Shall I ever be able to
hate what I have ſo affectionately loved; and from hatred can I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to revenge, againſt an object ſo dear to my heart, and that the
only object of all my affections? But if I do not, I ſhall be inſenſible
of the perſidiouſneſſe of an ungrateful woman; and can I with an
unparalleld baſeneſse endure thoſe extraordinary affronts which muſt
needs blaſt my honour for ever? Hatred, Love, you that divide my
heart between you, let either one or the other give place, and
perſecute not my ſoul with perpetual uncertainties and irreſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Many dayes did I ſpend in theſe reflections and diſcourſes, while
in the mean time my countenance began to change with my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and the alteration that happened, there, was ſo obſervable,
that all the World took notice of it. <hi>Eliſena</hi> was one of the firſt
that obſerved it, and by all demonſtrations and expreſſions of love
took occaſion to diſcover the grief ſhe conceived thereat; but her
carriage towards <hi>Cleontes</hi> was ſtill after the old rate. And whereas
my eies were now<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> much more open than they were before, and
diſcerned all things after another manner then I had done in times
paſt, methought, I could perceive in all her actions, ſo much ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe,
and ſo much love for <hi>Cleontes,</hi> that I made it no more a
queſtion, but that I was as unfortunate as I had imagined my ſelf.
I ſaw the whole day in a manner was little enough for them to ſpend
together; they had ever and anon ſome ſecret or other to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:97242:66"/>
one to another, and when they were at too great a diſtance
to ſpeak one to another, they diſcourſed by their eies, and caſt
looks at one another that were more eloquent than any thing of
converſation, and this to the obſervation of all the World as well
as my ſelf.</p>
                        <p>This alteration ſeemed very ſtrange, inſomuch that all thoſe
that had known <hi>Eliſena</hi> a little before could not without an exceſs
of aſtoniſhment, make any compariſon between theſe ſallies of
lightneſſe and liberty and her former reſervedneſſe and modeſty.
True it is nevertheleſſe, that notwithſtanding all thoſe demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of affection that paſt between her and <hi>Cleontes,</hi> her carriage
towards me was as it had been ever before, and I could never por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
either from her diſcourſe or her countenance, that there was
any abatement or remiſſion in her love towards me, or that ſhe was
leſſe taken with my perſon then at the firſt hour of our marriage.
Her careſſes, and her inſinuations were ſtill the ſame, ſhe ſpoke
with the ſame ſweetneſſe, and acted with the ſame complyance,
ſave that ſhe did it not ſo conſtantly as in times paſt, that ſhe left
me often to go and diſcourſe with <hi>Cleontes,</hi> and beſtowed on his
entertainment the beſt part of thoſe houres which ſhe had before
onely devoted to mine. At laſt, my grief was ſeconded and rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
by my reſentment of thoſe things, and after I had been a
long time ſad and melancholy, I became at length exaſperated,
and ſtudying how to be revenged of <hi>Cleontes,</hi> I began to diſcover
to <hi>Eliſena,</hi> how that her careſſes had not over me that influence
they were wont to have, that I looked on them as the pure effects
of artifice and diſſimulation, and that I felt my ſoul changed from
the love I ſometime had for her, to the paſſion that was moſt
contrary thereto. I gave over looking kindly on her, I
took a bed by my ſelf, and by degrees forbore all diſcourſe
with her.</p>
                        <p>She ſeemed to be as much troubled at this alteration as the moſt
affectionate woman in the World could poſſibly be, and gave me
all the demonſtrations of a grief as violent as any ſoul can be able
to endure. She uſed all the inſinuation that could be, ſhe melted
into tears, and omitted nothing, which ſhe could imagine might
perſwade me that ſhe was really moved. In ſome intervals, I was
extreamly ſenſible of thoſe expreſſions of her affliction, and thoſe
imperious remainders of love that were yet left in my ſoul did
partly produce therein the effect ſhe deſired; but a little after,
through the cruel prejudice that had taken root there, all was
daſhed out again, and I had no more regard to what ſhe did then,
as if it had been meer perſonation and ſycophancy. At laſt, after
a many dayes ſilence, ſhe would needs force me to ſpeak, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
found me all alone in my chamber, whither I was often wont
to retire ſince the change of my humour, ſhe runs to me with her
face bathed in tears, and graſping my both hands, with an action
full of earneſtneſſe and paſſion; <q>Ah, my deareſt Huſband, <hi>ſaid
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:97242:67"/>
ſhe to me,</hi> ſhall I be any longer unhappy, and not know the cauſe
of my unhappineſſe? And will you by ſo many ſeveral expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
make it appear to all the World that I am odious in your
ſight, and not acquaint me by what horrid misfortune I have
loſt your affection? Am I leſſe worthy of it now then I have
been formerly by reaſon of ſome defect which you have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in my perſon; or have I made my ſelf unworthy of it by
any offence I have committed againſt you?</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>To theſe words ſhe added a many others, no leſſe earneſt, and
preſſed upon me ſo far, that I could not forbear making her ſome
anſwer. <q>Madam, <hi>ſaid I to her,</hi> methinks you take abundance of
pains to expreſſe with your tongue that which hath no acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with your heart, and if my quiet had been ſo dear to you as
you would make be believe, you would not have utterly ruined
it by your own cruel inconſtancy. Tis enough for me to be
miſerable, and not that you ſhould aggravate my miſery by
your diſſimulation, and you ought to be ſatisfied with what
I have ſuffered hitherto, and not put my affection to greater
tryalls.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Eliſena</hi> ſeemed to be extreamly troubled at theſe words, as I
could eaſily obſerve in her countenance; but muſtring up all her
ſtrength together to recover her ſelf; <q>My Lord, <hi>ſaid ſhe to me,</hi>
it is not any change in me that diſturbs your quit, or may have
been the occaſion of that which is happened in your ſelf. The
gods are my witneſſes, that I am the ſame woman to you that
ever I was, and that my life is innocent even to the leaſt thoughts.
It is very ſtrange, <hi>replied I,</hi> that the thoughts ſhould be innocent
when the actions are criminal, and that when they appear ſuch
not onely to the eyes of a Huſband, but to thoſe of a thouſand
other perſons.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe words were a little indigeſtible to <hi>Eliſena,</hi> ſo that ſhe
took a little time to ruminate upon them without making me any
anſwer, but with the countenance of a perſon recollecting and
examining her ſelf, to find out wherein ſhe had offended. At laſt,
looking on me with an action which ſpoke ſomething of clearneſſe
and confidence, <q>Can it be poſſible, <hi>ſaid he to me,</hi> that the cauſe of
my unhappineſſe muſt be no other then the demonſtrations
of kindneſſe and friendſhip which have paſt between me and
<hi>Cleontes?</hi> And knowing me ſo well as you ought to know me,
is there any poſſibility that you ſhould perſwade your ſelf, that
in the good entertainment I make him, there can be any thing
criminal or unhandſome?</q> 
                           <q>The demonſtrations of your affection
towards <hi>Cleontes, replyed I,</hi> are ſo publick and ſo remarkable,
that you need not pretend ſo much aſtoniſhment, that, when all
the World had taken notice of them, they ſhould at laſt come to
my knowledge; and you ought to be ſo much the leſſe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
at the effect they have wrought on my diſpoſition, if you
but reflect on the love I have had for you.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="129" facs="tcp:97242:67"/>
This proved another bone for her to pick, ſo that ſhe could
not make any anſwer thereto till that ſhe had been ſilent a good
while, with an action that diſcovered her uncertainty, and loſſe
of reſolution. At length, lifting up her eies, which ſhe had all the
time before faſtened on the ground, and directing them on me with
a countenance much more ſetled and ſerene than before: <q>My
Lord, <hi>ſaid ſhe to me,</hi> when I recollect my ſelf, and call to mind
things that are now paſt, I much acknowledge, that there hath
been ſome want of prudence in my carriage, and if I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
any fault, no queſtion but it hath been out of the exceſſe
of confidence which I have had in your love. I cannot deny but
I have entertained <hi>Cleontes</hi> with very great demonſtrations of a
particular eſteem, nay, I confeſſe that I have ſtill abundance of
reſpects for him, as well upon the account of his own worth, as
for other reaſons which oblige me thereto, and which I ſhall
acquaint you with, when you ſhall give me leave to do it: but
I call all the gods witneſſes of my innocence, and deſire them
to ſend me ſome exemplary death before your face, if ever I
have injured you as much as in the leaſt thought, or ever diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in <hi>Cleontes</hi> any deſign or intention that you might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne.
I freely give you leave to take away my life, if in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
of time you find not my words true, and will accordingly
be ſorry for the injury you have done me. In the interim, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
you to reſtore me to your affection, the loſſe whereof is
much more inſupportable to me then would be that of my life.
And ſince you have not taken it away from me but upon unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
apparences, which rather argue my imprudence than bad
intentions, I ſhall make ſuch proviſion againſt the like for
the future, that you ſhall not have the leaſt occaſion to
ſuſpect me.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>This was the diſcourſe of <hi>Eliſena,</hi> but uttered with ſo much
aſſurance and ſerenity, that I began to be perſwaded ſhe might be
innocent; whereupon that love whereof there were ſtill ſome
remainders in my heart ſpeaking to me on her behalf, with as much
force as her words, diſpelled by little and little ſome part of my
ſuſpicions, and if it could not abſolutely clear them, and make it
a bright day in my mind, it did at leaſt put me into ſuch a poſture,
as that I was willing to hearken to what it ſuggeſted to me for her
advantage, and to expect her juſtification from time, in ſtead of
condemning her from what was paſt. I immediately acquainted
her with all the tranſactions that paſt in my ſoul, promiſing, that
in caſe I ſhould find her as innocent as ſhe would parſwade me ſhe
was, I ſhould love her with the ſame paſſion that I had ever had
for her, and ſhe entertained that promiſe and aſſurance with ſuch
demonſtrations of joy, that I could not at that time ſuſpect her
guilty of any artifice.</p>
                        <p>From that day ſhe began to live after another rate with <hi>Cleontes,</hi>
that is, with much more reſervedneſſe and diſtance than formerly;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:97242:68"/>
ſhe forbore all ſecret meetings, and private diſcourſes with him,
and entertained him no otherwiſe than as civility required, that
ſuch a perſon as <hi>Cleontes</hi> ſhould be. This alteration occaſioned a
change in my humour, and I began to recover the reſt I had a long
time wanted, and was convinced that <hi>Eliſena,</hi> having been a little
extravagant through the imprudent ſallies of youth, had by the
ſtrength of her own vertue and good advice recovered her ſelf.
I alſo, for my part, carryed my ſelf towards her as I had done
formerly, and expreſſed my love to her with the ſame earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
as I had done before my mind became diſordered by jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy.</p>
                        <p>This laſted for ſome months, during which time we lived toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with as much delight as can be imagined: but not long after,
the ſame perſon who had made the firſt diſcovery to me, came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to tell me of certain kind and amorous looks, and other
circumſtances whence he concluded there was a ſecret intelligence
between <hi>Eliſena</hi> and <hi>Cleontes.</hi> Now my diſpoſition being before
prepared for impreſſions of this nature, I entertained them much
more eaſily then at the firſt time, and obſerving my ſelf, that
there was a certain violence in that reſervedneſſe of <hi>Eliſena,</hi> I
fell into my former humour, and that ſo violently, that I was
likely enough to faſten on any deſperate reſolution.</p>
                        <p>When <hi>Eliſena</hi> was ſenſible of the alteration ſhe ſoon took notice
of in my countenance, and would know the reaſon of it, I anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
her with nothing but bloudy reproaches, and the paſſion I
was then poſſeſſed with, furniſhed me with all the words I could
deſire upon ſuch an occaſion. <hi>Eliſena</hi> heard them with much
patience, and at laſt, when I had given over ſpeaking, joyning
iſſue in the diſcourſe with abundance of reſolution, but a reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ful of modeſty, and the demonſtrations of that confidence which
is ever the attendant of innocency: <q>My Lord, <hi>ſaid ſhe to me,</hi> I
thought I had reduced my ſelf to ſuch a behaviour towards
<hi>Cleontes</hi> as you expected, and was of opinion, that I had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
him no otherwiſe then I ought in pure civility to do. But
ſince I have been ſo unhappy, either through my ill fortune, or
my imprudence, there is now no diſpute to be made of it, but
the occaſion muſt be removed, for the correſpondence which is
between <hi>Cleontes</hi> and me, is not of ſuch conſequence, as that we
ſhould thereby purchaſe the danger and inconveniences which
are the effects thereof. I ſhall not therefore tell you that I will
not ſee <hi>Cleontes</hi> any more, or that I will never ſpeak to him
again. No, this is not ſecurity enough for you, while <hi>Cleontes</hi>
ſhall continue in your territories; no, he muſt not tread your
ground; and though it ſpeaks a certain barbarouſneſſe and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
to force away a perſon from the place where he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ſanctuary againſt a malicious fortune, yet is not it conſiderable
in compariſon of the miſchiefes which his abode here hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
or hereafter, may occaſion. I will therefore take it upon
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:97242:68"/>
me to ſend him hence ſo as he ſhall never return again, and
after the term that you ſhall appoint for his departure is
expired, I promiſe you that neither you nor I ſhall ever ſee him
more.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe words of <hi>Eliſena</hi> gave me ſome ſatisfaction, though I
think ſhe diſcovered ſome violence when ſhe made that propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to me, and ſo, reſolved to grant it her. <q>Well Madam, <hi>ſaid I
to her,</hi> if you expect that you and I ſhould live together in any
quiet, there is a neceſſity that <hi>Cleontes</hi> ſhould be ſent away. His
longer abode here may haply involve us into ſome misfortunes
which we ſhall do well to avoid, when it lies in our own power
to do it; and therefore I ſhall intreat you to diſpoſe him to
leave us within eight dayes, that is the longeſt day I can afford
him to provide for his departure, and to find out ſome other
place for his refuge, and that time once expired, I beſeech you
let ſuch order be taken that he may never be ſeen in our domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
again.</q> 
                           <q>I promiſe you to do it, <hi>replies Eliſena,</hi> and I ſhall take
occaſion this very day to acquaint him therewith, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
what I can to have things ſo carryed, as not to raiſe among
our neighbours any ſuſpicion of the true cauſe of his departure.</q>
With thoſe words ſhe went away and left me, but as ſhe took
leave, ſhe expreſſed ſo much affliction in her eies, that it was eaſie
for me to judge, through the conſtancy which ſhe ſo much affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that it was not without a ſenſible regret that ſhe was induced
to diſpenſe with the company of <hi>Cleontes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The next day I ſaw them ſpeaking together, and I perceived they
were very earneſt in their diſcourſe, and, in their geſtures and
looks, diſcovered much ſadneſſe. But conceiving all to be in order
to his departure, I bore with their converſation, at that time, as
alſo what they had in my preſence the day following, during which
time <hi>Cleontes</hi> took leave of his friends, alledging certain reaſons
to them for his ſo ſudden leaving of them. The ſeventh day,
which was juſt that day before his departure, guided by ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
genius, and my own malicious fortune together, I would
needs take a walk in my Garden. And being deſirous of ſolitude,
and at that very time reflecting on the uncertainty I was in as to
what I ſhould believe of <hi>Eliſena,</hi> finding appearances of all ſides,
as well to demonſtrate her affection to me, as to ſatisfie me of her
infidelity, I went aſide from thoſe that followed me, and leaving
them ſome in one of the faireſt knots of the Garden, and others
in the more ſpacious walks, I went into thoſe that were moſt private
and ſolitary, and ſo continued my walk in the moſt remote parts of
the Garden. At the furtheſt end of the Knot, before mentioned, there
is a little handſome Grove, and in divers places of the Grove,
Arbours made of the boughs of trees plaſhed together. Coming
neer that which lies at the greateſt diſtance, I heard the noiſe of
ſome people talking, and going forward ſtill to come yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
neerer, and liſtening with much attention, I could diſcern the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:97242:69"/>
voice of <hi>Eliſena.</hi> The privacy of the place bred a little worm in
my braine, and I immediately ſuſpected there might be ſome
unhandſome action committed; and not willing to let ſlip an
opportunity; ſo favourable for the diſcovery of the truth, I
crept ſoftly between the trees, and coming neer the Arbour with
ſo little noiſe that I was not heard, I put my head cloſe to the
branches whereof it was made, and finding an eaſie paſſage for
my ſight, I preſently perceived all that was done in the Arbour.
O ye gods, what a ſpectacle, with what object were my eies
unhappily ſmitten with! I ſaw, my Lord, ſince I muſt rip up
theſe dolefull paſſages of my life, I ſaw <hi>Cleontes</hi> ſet upon a
little table that ſtood in the midle of the Arbour, holding
<hi>Eliſena</hi> ſtanding between his legges, compaſſing her with his
armes, while he was as amorouſly embraced by thoſe of <hi>Eliſena,</hi>
and at the ſame time both giving and receiving thouſands of
kiſſes from him. Sighs, tears, and bemoaning expreſſions were
the burthen of their careſſes, and reciprocally wiping off one
anothers tears, they reiterated their kiſſes with ſo much love,
that a perſon the leaſt ſubject of any in the World to ſuſpicion,
could never have been perſwaded but that there might be yet a
further familiarity between perſons ſo paſſionate. For my part,
I made not the leaſt queſtion of it, and from that fatall ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
concluding my unhappineſſe undeniable, I gave way to the
rage then gaining ground upon me, and ſtayed not a moment to
conſult upon the reſolution I was to take to revenge my injured
love, and to repair the loſſe of my honour. I ſeldom went any
where without my ſword, and as ill fortune would have it, I had
it it then about me. I drew it, tranſported with fury, and running
to one of the doors of the Arbour with ſo much haſt, that thoſe
two amorous perſons had hardly the time to break off their kiſſing;
<hi>You muſt dye, baſe perfidious wretches,</hi> cryed I, <hi>you muſt dye,</hi> and
putting my fury in execution upon the firſt object that offered it
ſelf, it fell upon the firſt object that offered it ſelf, it fell upon the
unfortunate <hi>Eliſena,</hi> whom running with my ſword in at the
breaſt, there needed not much ſtrength to force it in up to the hilts.
<hi>Cleontes</hi> had the time to get out at one of the doors of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and had got away as ſoon as he ſaw me appear with all the
ſpeed he could make: but the unfortunate <hi>Eliſena,</hi> who ſtood
neereſt to me, receiving the mortal wound, fell down at my feet
in a torrent of bloud; and as ſhe fell, faſtening on my knees, ſhe held
me ſo that I could not get off from her to run after <hi>Cleontes.</hi> In
the mean time <hi>Eliſena</hi> expiring, ſtrove as much as ſhe could to
ſpeak, and with abundance of difficulty made a ſhift to bring forth
theſe words. <q>
                              <hi>Zenodorus,</hi> ſaid ſhe to me, <hi>thou haſt ſpilt innocent
bloud, which will cry out for vengeance againſt thee; but far be it
from me to deſire it of the gods, and I forgive thee my death, which
my own imprudence, and thy want of recollection hath brought me
to: thou wilt find that I have not injured thee, and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:97242:69"/>
thy ſelf that thou haſt taken away my life, and medle not with</hi>
Cleontes, <hi>who is.</hi> ...</q> She would have ſaid ſomewhat elſe,
but ere ſhe could bring it out, both voice and life had taken their
leaves of her.</p>
                        <p>This ſpectacle, you may well imagine was deplorable enough
to move me to ſome pitty, and the love which I had formerly had
for <hi>Eliſena,</hi> whom I ſaw expiring at my feet, beautiful even in her
paleneſſe, and, amidſt the very looks of death, as amiable as ever
ſhe had been in her life, muſt in all likelihood force me to ſome
compaſſion. But rage and fury being grown predominant over
my ſoul, and I looking on the loſſe of my honour as a thing infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
certain, and from the laſt words of <hi>Eliſena,</hi> when ſhe recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
unto me the life of <hi>Cleontes,</hi> and ſeemed ſo indifferent as
to her own, drawing no other concluſion then that of the exceſſive
love ſhe had for him, my fury derives new ſtrength from that
cruel confirmation, and leaving the body of <hi>Eliſena</hi> in the hands of
her Women, who were come in at the noiſe, out of a place where
they waited hard by, I purſued <hi>Cleontes,</hi> with the ſword all
bloudy in my hand, that way that I had ſeen him run away. He
was gotten far enough from me, and I ſhould have found it no
ſmall difficulty to overtake him, if at the ſame time a noiſe had
not been ſpread about the Garden, that <hi>Eliſena</hi> was dead. At
this unhappy news, <hi>Cleontes</hi> ſtayes, not deſirous to ſave his life
after the misfortune which he had been the occaſion of, as I came
into the Knot of the Garden, I ſaw him coming towards me,
tearing his cloaths, pulling his hair, and filling the place with
his lamentations. Inſtead of avoiding my ſword, he would run
upon the point of it, and preſenting his naked breaſt to me, he
therein received the mortal thruſt which ran him through and
through. After he had gone two or three paces backward ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering,
he fell down at the feet of a <hi>Diana</hi> of Alablaſter, which
ſtood at one of the corners of the Knot, and as he fell embraced
it: <hi>Goddeſſe of chaſtity,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>receive this life which</hi> I <hi>offer up
up to thee, and if I ſtain it with my bloud, thou knoweſt it is pure
and innocent.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There was ſomething in theſe words that ſeemed ſo mild, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
ſo mournful, that the better part of my fury was thereby abated;
and while a many perſons were running to the place where I
was, the expiring <hi>Cleontes,</hi> turning his eyes from the ſtatue, and
faſtening them on me: <hi>Barbarous man,</hi> ſaid he to me, <hi>hope not that
the gods will pardon thee the death of the innocent</hi> Eliſena, <hi>though
I forgive thee mine, and ſince I have not life enough left me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
thee of her innocence, acknowledge it upon the ſight of what
I had never ſhewn any man, and which thou of all mankind art the
moſt unworthy to ſee.</hi> With theſe words, contracting together all
the ſtrength he had left, he made a ſhift to open, or to tear that
which covered his ſtomack, and by diſcovering to us a neck and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:97242:70"/>
breaſts, whiter then the Alablaſter which he embraced, eaſily ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
us that he was a <hi>Woman.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Artaxus</hi> interrupting <hi>Zenodorus</hi> at this paſſage; <q>Heavens!
<hi>Zenodorus, ſaid he to him,</hi> what is this that you relate to me,
and what an unfortunate adventure was this of yours? Till
now, though there were things deplorable enough in your rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet had I not been moved to compaſſion at any, and I
thought there was ſo much reaſon in all proceedings, that I
could not bemoane the deſtiny of two perſons whom I concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
worthy the chaſtiſement they received at your hands.
But theſe laſt words of your relation having, changed the whole
ſcene of the adventure, and though there lies no more guilt on
you then there would have done, had it been otherwiſe, yet
I muſt confeſſe your are ſo much the more to be pittyed.</q> You
may very well think it, my Lord, replyed <hi>Zenodorus,</hi> and with
the ſame labour comprehend ſome part of what I was not then
able to expreſſe. At that ſight, that fatal ſight, that fatall and
too ſlow diſcovery, I was in a manner more like a dead carkaſe
then thoſe I had deprived of life; and not able to oppoſe all the
paſſions which then made their ſeveral aſſaults on my ſoul with
as much violence as can be well imagined, nor expreſſe them by
words, I was almoſt grown immoveable and ſenſeleſſe in the arms
of thoſe perſons that were about me. I apprehended my ſelf at
the ſame to be the murtherer of two Women, of two beautiful
and amiable perſons, and two innocent perſons, whereof one had
been my own Wife, whom I had loved as dearly as my own ſoul,
and the other meerly upon the account of compaſſion had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
raiſed in me an affection towards her. This demonſtration of
the innocence and fidelity of <hi>Eliſena,</hi> did at the firſt reflection on
it ſtick a ſword into my heart, much more cruel than that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
I had pierced her breſt, and the ſight of that unfortunate
perſon, now no more <hi>Cleontes,</hi> but one of the handſomeſt Ladies
in the World, wounded my ſoul with the moſt violent affliction
that it was capable of: Certain it is, that ſome other perſon,
endued with a greater tenderneſſe of mind than I, who have ever
been of a fierce and harſh diſpoſition, had not ſurvived ſo deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
an accident, and yet, ſuch as I was, I really felt in my
heart whatever a lively and piercing grief can have in it of
torment.</p>
                        <p>After I had recollected my ſelf for ſome time in the hands of thoſe
perſons who had taken away my ſword from me, as having gathered
from the fury of my looks, that it was not unlikely I might do
my ſelf a miſchief, I drew neerer to that expiring Lady, making
ſigns to others to endeavour to help her, when perceiving my
intention; <q>Stand away, cruel man, <hi>ſaid ſhe to me,</hi> and come not
neer me. Thy aſſiſtance is more hateful to me then the death
thou haſt given me, and ſince the unfortunate <hi>Eliſena,</hi> whoſe
death I have unhappily been the occaſion of, is no longer living,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:97242:70"/>
oppoſe not the laſt demonſtrations of the friend ſhip I had for her,
and ſuffer me to expire without any other regret than that of
having ſacrificed to my misfortune, a perſon ſo vertuous as ſhe
was. O <hi>Eliſena, Eliſena,</hi> ſince my laſt kiſſes proved ſo fatal to
thee, learn among the dead, where I am coming to enjoy thee
again, that I was unwilling to ſurvive thee, and that I run after
thee to continue among the ſhades that friendſhip which was ſo
dear to us hear?</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>As ſhe uttered theſe words, ſhe ſaw paſſing by the body of
<hi>Eliſena,</hi> which they were carrying out of the Garden, and at that
ſight, crying out louder than her weakneſſe could bear, ſhe withal
ſent out her laſt breath in the arms of thoſe that were come about
to relieve her. Among thoſe that came immediately after, a
young Gentlewoman that ſerved her, and who after her example
diſguiſed her ſex by mans cloaths, caſting her ſelf upon the body
as ſoon as ſhe could get neer it, made the aire echo again with her
cryes and her lamentations, and did a many things worthy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,
which I was not in a condition to take notice of, for that
as the ſight of the body of <hi>Eliſena,</hi> which they had very indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly
cauſed to be carryed cloſe by me, I grew abſolutely ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
and diſtracted, and was conveyed away and caſt upon my
bed, where I was carefully looked after, out of a fear I ſhould
have fallen into deſpaire. When I had a little recovered my ſelf,
I ran to the place where they had laid the body of <hi>Eliſena,</hi> and
giving it thouſands of kiſſes with an affection equal to that I had
for her at the beginning of our unfortunate marriage, I did all
that lay in my power to dye neer her, and have a thouſand times
ſince wondred, that my grief alone ſhould not be ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to do that which no doubt I ſhould have done with my
ſword, had I been left at liberty. Her innocency and her vertue
being then but too too well known to me, I became a continual
prey to that remorſe, and thoſe implacable furies which unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully
torment the ſoule; and, looking on my ſelf as a Dragon, or
ſome horrid monſter, I made againſt my ſelf the moſt terrible impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
that a man could make againſt his moſt inveterate enemies.</p>
                        <p>From the body of <hi>Eliſena</hi> I went to that of the unfortunate
companion and partaker of her death, and though I had not
had any affection for her while ſhe lived, yet had the unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of her deſtiny ſuch an influence upon me, and ſhe had
appeared to me ſo amiable, even in the laſt minutes of her
life, and in the laſt words ſhe ſpoke, that my ſoul was poſſeſſed
by ſomething greater then compaſſion, and I was no leſſe liberal
of my tears for her death, then for that of <hi>Eliſena.</hi> When I
was ſo far recovered, as that I could apprehend any thing was ſad
to me, I was very deſirons to know who ſhe was, and the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
that had waited on her, and who after her death had
no reaſon to conceal what ſhe had kept ſecret while ſhe lived,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:97242:71"/>
being brought before me, though ſhe could not look on me
without horrour and deteſtation, and being informed what
my deſires were, gave me this account of her; <q>Since you are
ſo deſirous to know, <hi>ſaid ſhe to me,</hi> who this unfortunate
woman, whom you have put to death, was; I ſhall ſoon
ſatisfie you to your ſorrow, for with that you ſhall know
what enemies you have raiſed your ſelf by your crueltie.
She was born among the <hi>Parthians,</hi> of an extraction that is
equally noble with any of the ſubjects of <hi>Phraates,</hi> and was
allyed on both ſides to the Illuſtrious Family of the <hi>Arſacides.</hi>
Her name was <hi>Arteſia,</hi> and her beauty ſuch, when it appeared
in its meridian luſtre, under cloaths ſuitable to her ſex, that
the World can afford but few comparable to her. She hath
neglected it very much ever ſince, and indeed hath had no
great reaſon to be much in love with it, becauſe it hath
proved the occaſion of all the misfortunes that have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to her. Being brought up about the Queen, as a
Princeſſe that could claime ſome kinred to her, and having
in a ſhort time diſcovered to the whole Court, as well
the beauty of her countenance, as that of her underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſhe was there generally beloved; but indeed much
more than ſhe deſired to be, inſomuch, that the amiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of her perſon having enflamed <hi>Phraates</hi> with an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
towards her, ſhe became accordingly the object of his cruel
perſecution. She endured the torment of it for ſome time
with an admirable vertue, and endeavoured to ſmother the
extravagant inclinations of the King, by all thoſe wayes
which in any other ſoul might have produced that effect.
But her modeſty and reſiſtance adding to the eagerneſſe of
the Kings love, he would at laſt needs come to violence,
and without any conſideration of the nobleneſſe of <hi>Arteſia</hi>'s
bloud, which was no other than a branch of his own, he
laid a deſign how to put his wicked reſolutions in execution
upon her. This vertuous Lady, whoſe Father had been
dead many years before, deſtitute of all protection againſt
her King, and that ſuch a King, as to whom, after he had
put to death his own Father, all crimes ought to be eaſie and
familiar, had no way but to flye, to deliver her vertue from that
tempeſt, and there being no way for her to conceale her ſelf
from ſo great a King, but by diſguiſing her ſex, ſhe put on
mans cloaths, and cauſing me to do the like, took onely
me along with her in her flight, and two ancient men-ſervants
of her Fathers, whoſe fidelity ſhe was confident of. After
ſeveral journies to and fro, wherein ſhe had ſtill inviolably
kept the ſecrets of her adventure, ſhe at laſt came into your
territories. It was not her deſign to make any long ſtay
therein; but ſhe was immediately charmed by the vertue of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:97242:71"/>
                              <hi>
                                 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>liſena,</hi> and in proceſſe of time coming to a perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of her, and conceaving her a perſon with whom ſhe
might ſafely enter into a ſolid friendſhip, and in whom ſhe
might repoſe a great confidence, ſhe diſcovered her ſelf to her,
acquainted her with her Fortune, and revealed to her what ſhe
had ſo carefully concealed from all the World. <hi>Eliſena</hi>
entertained theſe demonſtrations of her affection and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with an admirable goodneſſe, and offered her all the
aſſiſtance that lay in her power. This was meerly the effect
of her generoſity as to a ſtranger; but not long after, the
vertue and excellent endowments of <hi>Arteſia</hi> having wrought
their effect on the ſpirit of <hi>Eliſena,</hi> as thoſe of <hi>Eliſena</hi> had
upon that of <hi>Arteſia,</hi> it became the cement of ſuch a perfect
friendſhip between theſe two amiable perſons, that the preſent
age could hardly have furniſhed us with a nobler example.
The mutual demonſtrations which they gave thereof one to
another, with leſſe circumſpection than perſons, whoſe inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are criminal, are wont to obſerve, raiſed jealouſies and
ſuſpicions in you, inſomuch, that upon the firſt diſcoveries you
made thereof, they conſulted together, and conſidered whether
it were ſafe to diſcover the truth to you, and acquaint you
with the ſex and fortunes of <hi>Arteſia.</hi> But after much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
<hi>Eliſena</hi> her ſelf thought it not either ſafe or ſeaſonable,
and knowing that you ſtood in ſome fear of the power of
<hi>Phraates,</hi> and that your Tetrarchy lying neer his great
Empire, it concerned you very much to hold a good correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with him, did not think it fit that that ſecret ſhould be
communicated to you, as being in ſome fear, that either to
put an obligation upon <hi>Phraates,</hi> or to avoid the occaſion of
making him your enemy, you might diſcover to him that
<hi>Arteſia</hi> was in your power, and haply have ſent her back to
him. The ſincere friendſhip which <hi>Eliſena</hi> had for <hi>Arteſia,</hi>
inſpired her with that fear, which indeed became ſo great
afterwards, that upon your relapſe into jealouſie, and the
ſecond diſcoveries you made thereof, ſhe choſe rather to be
deprived the ſight and company of her friend, then that you
ſhould be acquainted with the ſecret of her life, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
expoſe it to any danger. This ſeparation could not
but occaſion a violent grief on both ſides, inſomuch, that when
you unfortunately took them in the Arbour, they were taking
their laſt leaves one of another, with thoſe demonſtrations of
friendſhip which proved ſo fatal to them. You are but too
well acquainted with what followed, I deſire to be excuſed as
to any further diſcourſe with you, and your leave to returne
to that body which I ſo much loved when living, to render it
my laſt ſervices, and to take ſome courſe for the carrying of it
away out of this cruel country, and, ſince it is now beyond all fear
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:97242:72"/>
of the violences of <hi>Phraates,</hi> diſpoſe it among the monuments of
her Fathers.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Such was the diſcourſe of the deſolate Gentlewoman,
whereby coming to underſtand as well the extraction, as ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of <hi>Arteſia,</hi> I felt the grief and remorſe, which I thought
violent enough before, aſſuming new ſtrength to torment me the
more. I was in a perpetual poſture of ſighing and ſobbing,
which being pent up in the cranies of my breaſt, forced out
their way with the greater violence, bringing forth with them
words ſo pittiful, that it raiſed a certain compaſſion in all thoſe,
who upon the cruel conſequences of my miſtake had conceived a
horrour for me. I continually called upon the name of <hi>Eliſena,</hi>
and with that of <hi>Eliſena,</hi> I oftentimes brought out that of <hi>Arteſia,</hi>
whoſe lamentable adventure I was no leſſe troubled at, then I was
for the loſſe of my wife, whom I had thought ſo amiable, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
ſo dearly loved.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall not tire you, my Lord, with tedious diſcourſes of my
complaints, or with relations of all thoſe things which I did for
ſome dayes, during the extravagance of my affliction, and ſhall
onely tell you, that thoſe who know me at this preſent, and know
what courſe of life I have led for theſe many years together,
would not eaſily believe the ſtrange effects it wrought in me.
The Gentlewoman, who had waited on <hi>Arteſia,</hi> and her two
ancient ſervants, having cauſed the body to be embalmed, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it away into their own Country; and that of my <hi>Eliſena,</hi>
was diſpoſed into a ſumptuous Monument which I cauſed to be
built for her. I viſited it every day, and ſpent whole houres
in waſhing it with my tears, embracing the cold Marble, and doing
a hundred actions which ſufficiently diſcovered my love, melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
and deſpaire. There was not any thing from which I
could derive any comfort; in the day time I avoided the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of men, and in the night, methoughts I ſaw perpetually at
my beds head, the unfortunate images of <hi>Eliſena</hi> and <hi>Arteſia,</hi>
ſhewing me their wounds, and loading me with the moſt bitter
reproaches that might be. During theſe imaginations, I was
many times in a manner diſtracted, inſomuch, that in time,
if I were not grown abſolutely mad, I was at leaſt ſo far gone,
that I had nothing of mildneſſe, nothing of a ſociable hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
left in me. By degrees I became more and more ſavage,
and barbarous, much more than I was naturally inclined to be,
and out of an imagination I had, that all the World ought to
abhorre me, I began to abhorre all the World. Accordingly,
from that time all things fell out contrary to my expectations,
and my crime was ſuch, that Fortune declared her ſelf my enemy
as well as men. The King of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> who was infinitely
troubled at the death of <hi>Arteſia,</hi> immediately reſolved to ruine
me, and <hi>Herod,</hi> who watched all occaſions to poſſeſſe himſelf of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:97242:72"/>
my Tetrarchy, to joyne it to his own dominions, whereof he
conceived it ſhould be ſome part, having no pretence of war
againſt me himſelf, promoted underhand the deſignes of the
<hi>Parthian</hi> King, gave a paſſage through his Country, to the Army
he ſent againſt me, and ſupplyed them with proviſions, out of hopes
of getting my eſtate into his hands.</p>
                        <p>Things fell out, in a manner as they had deſigned they ſhould,
ſo that I, who in the height and favour of fortune, had not
been able to oppoſe the forces which the King of the <hi>Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
ſent againſt me, could hardly, in the misfortune, I was
fallen into, loſt as to friends, courage, and all things, make
any reſiſtance againſt them. The <hi>Parthians</hi> forced me out of
my country, and <hi>Herod</hi> having gotten it into his hands upon ſome
treaty there had paſt between him and <hi>Phraates,</hi> he not long after
went and begged it of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> alledgiug that he had ſome inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
in it, during the time that <hi>Liſanias</hi> was in poſſeſſion thereof.
It was beſtowed on him, and he was put into poſſeſſion thereof
by the Emperour, who ſent <hi>Soſius</hi> to ſettle him quietly in it, and
who accordingly maintained him therein, againſt the pretentions
of the King of the <hi>Parthians.</hi> This was the occaſion of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
wherein <hi>Phraates</hi> was ſo much exaſperated againſt <hi>Herod,</hi>
and which bred the war that hath happened between them ſince,
and which was begun by <hi>Phraates</hi> not long after the carrying away
of <hi>Phaſela,</hi> and old <hi>Hircan.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the mean time I made a ſhift to get away with a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of ſhips, deſtitute of all friends and ſupply, nay indeed loſt as
to all things; for having applyed my ſelf every where for aſſiſtance,
all proved ineffectual, all denyed me. Inſomuch, that, my mind
exaſperated by the conſtant malice of my Fortune, I became loſt as
to all vertue and morality; and thence out of an aſſurance I had
that all the World were enemies to me, I became an enemy to all
the World. While my grief, for the loſſe of <hi>Eliſena</hi> continued
ſtrong upon my ſpirits, I was but little troubled at the loſſe of my
eſtate, and friends; but when time had wrought ſome abatement
of it, I could not, without indignation and rage, look on the
change of my condition, and ſee <hi>Herod</hi> poſſeſſed of all I had,
and ſo powerful through the authority of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
him in it, that there was but little probability of ever get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it out of his hands.</p>
                        <p>This put me upon reſolutions of getting that elſewhere which
had been wreſted out of my hands at home, and having yet a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of ſhips under my command, I began to make a Sea-war; firſt
againſt thoſe only that had taken away my eſtate, and afterwards
againſt all Nations, without any choice or diſtinction of parties.
I had gotten with me my Nephew <hi>Ephialtes,</hi> as valiant and daring
a perſon, as ever followed this courſe of life, who contributed
much to the carrying on of my deſigne; inſomuch that when I
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:97242:73"/>
had, by a great number of rich priſes, got together abundance of
wealth, I bought more ſhips, and ſo reinforced my Fleet, and
lur'd in a many ſouldiers, who found better ſervice and pay in our
war, than they would have done in any lawful one. In fine, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
ſo powerful, that I had ſquadrons of ſhips on all ſeas. Having
made <hi>Ephialtes</hi> my Vice-Admiral in thoſe parts of the ſea which
admitted not of any communication by ſea, we went and met by
land, having Horſes and private retreats for that purpoſe. So that
of a deſolate man, and one that in all probability ſhould have ſpent
his whole life in weeping over a Tomb, I became terrible and
dreadful to all Nations, the terrour of all that had any buſineſſe
with the ſea, and famous for thouſands of Priſes, which had made
me the richeſt of all the Pyrates that ever were. This courſe of
life have I led for theſe ten years very neer, and yet I ſhall not
entertain you with the moſt conſiderable actions I have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in, not onely becauſe it would require a long relation, ſuch
as poſſibly might prove very troubleſome to your Majeſty, but
alſo for that I am confident you have already had ſome account
thereof, and have, not without aſtoniſhment, heard of the ſeveral
changes of my Fortune. I ſhall therefore onely tell you, that
during the ſpace of ten years, that I have followed this trade,
there happened not any thing memorable unto me, in compariſon
of what hath come to paſſe, within theſe few dayes upon theſe
very coaſts, there having in a manner at the ſame time, fallen into
my hands, two of the moſt beautiful preyes that the whole uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
can afford. And this I am confident you cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
when I have told you that in two dayes time, I had in my
power and diſpoſal the fair <hi>Candace</hi> Queen of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> and the
Princeſſe <hi>Eliſa,</hi> the onely daughter and heir of the great King
of the <hi>Parthians.</hi> I took the Queen of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> juſt at the
mouth of the <hi>Nile;</hi> and this ſoul of mine, which ſince the death
of <hi>Eliſena,</hi> had not entertained the leaſt impreſſion of love, nor
ever thought it could have been capable of any, remitted ſome
part of its Forces, upon the firſt view of that Princeſſe, and, by
degrees, became abſolutely ſubject to her Beauties. I was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
both of her name and quality; and yet love made me at firſt
ſlight the proffers ſhe made me of a conſiderable ranſome, and
when afterwards ſhe told me that ſhe was Queen <hi>Candace,</hi> I
would not abſolutely believe what ſhe ſaid, out of an imagination
that ſhe might take that name upon her, purpoſely to keep me
within thoſe terms of reſpect which ſhe perceived I ſhould not
be long able to obſerve. During that uncertainty, I did all that
lay in my power to perſwade her to my will, and having found all
the waies I took ineffectual, I hoped at laſt to effect my own ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
by making uſe of the power I had over her, when that
during the ſpace of one night, which I had allotted her to fix
on ſome reſolution, this Princeſſe, daring above her ſex, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:97242:73"/>
all example, ſet my ſhip on fire, which broke forth in ſeveral
places, and caſt her ſelf into the ſea within ſome few ſtadia of
this river. You may well imagine what an aſtoniſhment I was
in when it came to my knowledge that I had loſt her in that
manner. I made the beſt ſhift I could to repaire the breaches
which the fire had made in my ſhip, that I might the ſooner make
after her into this river, whither I conceived ſhe might get upon
planks, with the aſſiſtance of ſome men, who had caſt themſelves
over-board at the ſame time with her.</p>
                        <p>We were very buſie a mending of our ſhips, when it was the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of Fortune, (to make me ſome requital for the former
loſſe) to ſend me a veſſel, wherein was the Princeſſe of the
<hi>Parthians,</hi> which having with much adoe eſcaped wrack in a
great tempeſt that had been, and being not furniſhed with men to
maintain her, came and caſt her ſelf into our hands. We board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her without any great difficulty, and the firſt thing I was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
with, was the ſhouts of certain ſlaves, whom I found to
have been my ſouldiers, and ſome of thoſe that I had left
<hi>Ephialtus.</hi> They preſently gave me an account of the death
of my Nephew, and pointing to a perſon that ſtood neer the
Princeſſe, they told he had been his murtherer. I caſt my eyes
on the man, and notwithſtanding the admirable things I could
obſerve in him, yet was I reſolved his life ſhould be ſacrificed to
the <hi>Manes</hi> of my Nephew, whom I had ſo dearly loved, and
thereupon cauſed the points of all our ſwords to be turned
upon him. But good gods, how ſtrangely did he behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf!
for paſſing through our armes without any fear, he comes
up to me, takes hold of me by the midle, and caſt himſelf into
the ſea, with me in his arms. I was relieved and taken up again
by my own men, not without ſome difficulty; but when I had
recovered the danger, caſt up the water I had drunk, and put on
other cloaths, the preſence of a Beauty which all the World
might admire, but that ſeemed orewhelmed with an inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
grief, could not make me forget her, who may be ſaid to have
ſet my heart a fire as truely as ſhe had done my ſhip. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
reſolving to follow her living, or find out her dead body
about this river, I came hither, and landed with thirty of my
men, leaving the fair prize I had taken in my Veſſel, under the care
of a Lieutenant whom I truſted her with. I wandred up and down
the river-ſide all that day, and could not make the leaſt diſcovery
of what I ſought, and the next day, after I had ſpent ſome part of
the day in the ſame enquiry, and having divided my men into
ſeveral parties, in order to viſit more places, I came at laſt, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed
onely by two of them, neer a ſpring, where I ſaw two men
engaged in a furious combat. They were both perſons of an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
goodly preſence, their arms rich and magnificent; but
there was nothing comparable to the valour wherewith they
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:97242:74"/>
fought, but the animoſity they expreſſed in the combat. One of
the two had upon his armes, which glittered with gold, the <hi>Roman</hi>
Eagle ſpread in divers places, and thoſe of his adverſary remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for certain Lyons, cauſing me to obſerve his ſtature and
action, I at laſt diſcovered him to be the ſame perſon that had caſt
himſelf over-boord with me in his arms, and whom I had given
over for drowned.</p>
                        <p>I was at a loſſe what I ſhould do upon this occaſion, when,
notwithſtanding the attention whereto it might be thought the
combat obliged him, he caſt his eyes towards me, and immediately
calling me to mind, he retreated a little before his enemy, and
having ſaid ſomething to him, which I could not hear, he left him,
and fell upon me with as little mercy as a bird would on his prey.
I was aſtoniſhed at the violence of his proceeding, but though I
had then no other arms about me but my ſword, yet I ſaw there
was a neceſſity I ſhould put my ſelf into ſome poſture of defence.
When I ſaw falling dead at my feet upon the dealing of but two
blows, my two companions, who had ſet themſelves before me; I
muſt needs confeſſe, that this ſudden execution frightned me a
little, and ſeeing my ſelf without arms, to engage with a man
armed all over, I was afraid to meet with him, and ſo made away
from him as faſt as ever my horſe could carry me. I rid a great
way, flying ſtill before him, and he had very neer overtaken me,
when coming into a pleaſant valley, I met with a perſon on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
very ſumptuouſly and richly, armed, who ſecured me from
him, and in the very ſame place had I ſight of the admirable Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,
whom I ſought after. I was not a little encouraged at this
happy adventure, but being not in a condition to carry her away
without ſome aſſiſtance, I returned to my companions, and having
met with ſome of them, I came back again along with them into
the Valley, and with their help carryed away the fair <hi>Candace,</hi>
on horſe back. Tis true, the greateſt part of my ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
were killed by thoſe valiant men that engaged with us
at our coming into the place, inſomuch that I had but one about
me by that time I got to the river ſide. Here it was that I was
ſatisfyed as to the inconſtancy of Fortune, who had treated me ſo
odly in one and the ſame day; for my ſhips were all gone, and
caſting my eyes toward the ſea, I ſaw them at a good diſtance,
making as much ſaile as they could away. However I reſolved
not to quit my prize, and accordingly carryed her into a Wood
that was hard by, in ſpight of all the reſiſtance ſhe could make.
At laſt having made a ſhift to get from me, while I was upon the
point of recovering her again, I was ſet upon by divers men
on horſeback, and being run through with a ſword, I fell
down to the ground with very little hopes of life. That
ſouldier of mine who had followed me, ſaw me fall at a
good diſtance from the place; and when our enemies were
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:97242:74"/>
gone away with the Princeſſe, he came back to me, meeting in
his way with another party of his companions, which I had ſent
ſome other way, and had not been engaged in the fight we
had had. They were extreamly caſt down to ſee what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
I was in, and perceiving there were ſome remainders
of life in me, they carryed me to a poor Country-mans houſe
not far from that place. This man was ſent into the City for a
Chirurgeon, having before engaged himſelf to keep all things
ſecret, and my men having put them both into hopes of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
rewards for the good they ſhould do me, they have
accordingly done as much for me as I could have deſired them.
I had about me both money and jewels to engage them to
ſidelity and attendance, and I muſt confeſſe, they have done all
things with ſo much good ſucceſſe and ſecrecy, that they have
brought me into the condition you now find me in, without the
leaſt diſcovery of any thing.</p>
                        <p>During the time I remained at that houſe, ſuch of my men
as had gone ſeverall times to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> purpoſely to ſee
what news were ſtirring, brought me word that <hi>Candace</hi> was in
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> that it was the Praetor himſelf that had wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me, and that the very ſame day thoſe whom he had
ſent to ſea had taken my ſhips, killed all the reſt of my men,
together with my treacherous Lieutenant, and recovered the
Beauty I had left with him, who had diſcovered her ſelf to be
<hi>Eliſa,</hi> Princeſſe of the <hi>Parthians.</hi> Till then had I been ignorant
who ſhe was; but had learned <hi>Candaces</hi> name from her own
mouth, as I told you before, though my people told me, that ſhe
was not known in <hi>Alexandria</hi> for any other then a Lady of
great quality, born in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> and one whom it was thought
the Praetor was fallen very deeply in love with. In a word, my
Lord, having loſt my ſhips, my men, and the noble prizes I
had taken, with the aſſiſtance I have happily met with, I am
gotten into the condition wherein you ſee me, and this very
day, as I was thinking of my departure from that houſe, <hi>Ariſtus,</hi>
ſeeking out where there were any proviſions to be ſold, comes in.
We had been heretofore very intimate friends, and, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the alteration, which ſo many years muſt needs have
made in our faces, yet after we had looked a good while
one upon the other, we called one another to mind, we
embraced, and after we had enquired one after another
what accidents or occaſions had brought us into theſe parts,
he told me, that your Majeſty was hereabouts, and made
me believe that my own ſervice, and that of theſe men I
have left me, might be worth your acceptance, and contribute
ſomewhat to the furtherance of your deſignes. Whereupon I
thought my ſelf obliged to follow him, which I did with
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:97242:75"/>
the greater joy, for that it gives me ſome occaſion to ſatisfie
you, that even in the midſt of my misfortunes, notwithſtanding
all the changes I have run through, nothing hath been able
to force out of my memory the reſentment of your goodneſſes,
or the deſire I have, by all the ſervices it lies in my power to do
you, to acknowledge them.</p>

                        <p>THe King of <hi>Armenia</hi> acquaints <hi>Zenodorus</hi> how he had
brought away the Princeſſes <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> tells
him what deſignes he had upon them, and is encouraged
in his enterprize by the <hi>Pirate. Artaxus</hi> is ſet upon by an
<hi>Egyptian</hi> Veſſel, for the deliverance of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and is
like to gain the victory, when an unknown perſon that was
in <hi>Artaxa's</hi> ſhip, awakened by the noiſe, comes in to the
relief of the <hi>Armenian,</hi> and forces the <hi>Egyptian</hi> to retreat.
Having ſecured the victory, he is known by <hi>Cleopatra</hi> to
be <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> whereat ſhe is almoſt diſtracted. Vpon her
reproaches to him for the diſſervice he had done her, he
ſwounds, but ſoon after recovers, pleads his ignorance, and
the innocency of his intentions. To expiate his crime, he
undertakes to deliver her out of the hands of <hi>Artaxus,</hi> who
thereupon ſets his men to kill him, but upon the mediation
of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> he is proffered life and liberty. He refuſing
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:97242:76"/>
both, is again ſet upon, kills <hi>Ariſtus, Zenodorus,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
others, and keeps all in play ſo long, till a ſhip of
<hi>Alexandria</hi> coming in queſt of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> comes to his relief.
The ſhips being ready to cloſe, <hi>Artaxus</hi> threatens to kill the two
Princeſſes, whereupon the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Veſſel, wherein were the
Princes, <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Marcellus,</hi> dares not faſten on the
other. <hi>Artaxus</hi> would have put his barbarous deſign upon
the Princeſſes in execution, but is miraculouſly prevented by
<hi>Coriolanus,</hi> who thruſting him to the other ſide of the ſhip,
ſets himſelf before the Princeſſes. <hi>Marcellus</hi> taking his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
upon that interval, boards the <hi>Armenian. Alexander</hi>
would have killed <hi>Artaxus,</hi> but, upon the mediation of <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſa,</hi>
forbeans; yet he, ſcorning life from an enemy, falls upon
his own ſword. <hi>Coriolanus</hi> is charged with, and, at laſt,
informed what his ancient infidelity to <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra</hi>
was, promiſes to clear himſelf, and is promiſed to be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to <hi>Cleopatra's</hi> affection. <hi>Marcellus, Alexander,</hi> and the
two Princeſſes return to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> whither the body of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxus</hi>
is brought by <hi>Megacles,</hi> who in his way ſet <hi>Coriolanus</hi>
aſhore, to find out ſome means to approve himſelf a faithful lover
and ſervant of <hi>Cleopatra.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <pb n="147" facs="tcp:97242:76"/>
THis was the concluſion of <hi>Zenodorus's</hi> diſcourſe,
and when he had given over ſpeaking, the King
of <hi>Armenia</hi> acknowledged his obligations to him
for the proffers he had made him of his Services,
and by way of requital promiſed him, that, as ſoon
as they were arrived in <hi>Armenia,</hi> he would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
him with all the aſſiſtance he could deſire, either to reſtore
him to his Eſtate again, that he might spend the reſt of his life
in quiet, or put him to ſea in as good a condition as he had been
in ſome daies before. <hi>Zenodorus</hi> told him on the other ſide, that
it was neither prudence nor ſafe for him to make any ſtay in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi>
becauſe of the Friends of <hi>Eliſena,</hi> who could not look
on him without a certain horrour, and therefore he relied more
upon the hopes he had put him into, of his furtherances in that
courſe of life which he was reſolved to follow. <hi>Artaxus,</hi> who
by this unexpected ſupply was twice as ſtrong as he had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in men, not onely well verſed in Sea-affaires, but much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with thoſe coaſts, was not a little glad of the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
and out of a deſign of engaging <hi>Zenodorus</hi> the more to
ſerve him, he thought it not amiſſe to diſcover to him all that
had paſſed, how things then ſtood, and related to him the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
how he had brought away the Princeſſe <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſa,</hi>
and how that his intentions were to carry them to <hi>Armenia</hi>
as ſoon as the wind ſhould ſerve.</p>
                     <p>The Pirate was infinitely pleaſed to ſee a King fallen into that
courſe of life which he had followed for ſo many yeares, and
being almoſt out of himſelf for joy that he had ſuch a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
he encouraged him in his enterpriſe, and promiſed him
ſucceſſe in it, or that he would periſh in his Service. Theſe
two ſoules, neer of the ſame making, were extreamly glad at
this renewing of their acquaintance, but <hi>Megaeles,</hi> a perſon of
a quite different diſpoſition, and one that could not without a
certain regreet endure the violences of his Maſter, looked on
the Pirate with horrour, and had ſhed many teares at the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
adventure of the deplorable <hi>Eliſena.</hi> Having therefore
taken his reſt (which he ſhould otherwiſe have done out of a
conſideration of his indispoſition) during the whole time that
this relation had laſted, <hi>Artaxus,</hi> thinking it long ſince he had
ſeen the Princeſſe <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> roſe up from his bed, and was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to her chamber. But before he was gotten into it calling to
mind that vertuous unknown perſon in whoſe commendation
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:97242:77"/>
                        <hi>Megacles</hi> had ſpoken ſuch great things, and though he were of
a cruell nature, yet upon the account of his courage, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
was very great in him, having a certain eſteem for noble
and generous perſons, he would needs give him a viſit, and ſo
went to the place where he was in his bed. The unknown per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
lifted himſelfe half up at his coming in, for having heard the
word King often spoken of in the veſſel, out of an imagination
that he might be the King himſelf who did him that civility, he
received him with abundance of respect, and with as great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations
of cheerfulneſſe, as might be expected from ſo deep
a melancholy as he then groaned under. The place was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
dark, and the day almoſt spent; but it was not long e're
torches were brought in, by the light whereof the King ſoon
diſcovered the gracefulneſſe of the unknown perſon; which rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in him not onely aſtoniſhment but much respect for him.
The firſt diſcourſe he made to him, was to expreſſe how much he
was ſatisfied with the aſſiſtances he had received from <hi>Megacles,</hi>
repeating ſome part of thoſe proffers which <hi>Megacles</hi> had made
him before: and the unknown perſon on the other ſide, though
he entertained them not as one that had any intention to make
advantage of them, yet acknowledged how great an obligation
he had laid upon him, and did it in ſuch termes and with ſuch a
grace as raiſed no ſmall admiration in the <hi>Armenian.</hi> Having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
by the account <hi>Megacles</hi> had given of him, that he was
a perſon much inclined to Vertue, he thought it not fit to let
him know any thing of his carrying away of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> as concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
he might not approve of it, whence it may be inferred that
Vertue hath this advantage, that even in the perſons of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable,
ſhe raiſes a fear of her ſelf in the moſt happy and moſt
powerfull. He told him that he had to his no ſmall ſatisfaction
underſtood, that ſince his coming into the ſhip, he had loſt ſome
part of that averſion which he had for life, or at leaſt that he
would not prove his own executioner as he had intended the
day before. The unknown perſon made him anſwer, that as to
matter of Life, it was no dearer to him then it had been, when
he had endeavoured to rid himſelf of it; but that having cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to mind a certain obligation that lay upon him, to continue
it till ſuch time as he ſhould be diſengaged from it, he had reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to make one attempt more to meet with ſome opportunity
to do it, and conſequently not die with a regreet of having omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
any part of his duty.</p>
                     <p>That diſcourſe ended, the King aſked him whether he would
goe along with him, in a voyage he intended to make with the
firſt fair wind, or if he had no inclinations to that, whether he
had in ſome other deſigne any occaſion of his aſſiſtance? The
unknown perſon made anſwer, that not able to imagine how he
could do him any ſervice by reaſon of the deſpicable condition
whereto fortune had reduced him, and ſatisfied on the other ſide
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:97242:77"/>
that being unſerviceable he muſt needs be troubleſome, he made
no proffers of his company, but entreated him, that, e're they
ſet ſaile thence, he would order him to be ſet ſomewhere
aſhore.</p>
                     <p>Some further complements paſt between them; but at laſt the
King remembring where he was to goe, and impatient to ſee the
Princeſſe, put a period to the diſcourſe, and having left the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to his reſt, which he ſeemed very much to want, he went
to the chamber where <hi>Cleopatra</hi> was. He came to her with a
countenance wherein through the Love it diſcovered, was viſible
ſome part of the diſcontent he was in; and not able to diſſemble
the occaſion of it: <q>All things, Madam, <hi>ſaid he to her,</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to me, all things oppoſe me, while you are againſt me,
nay, the winds themſelves, which ſeem to depend of another
power than yours, will never turn to do me any ſervice while I
am hatefull in your ſight. You may thence alſo infer, <hi>replied
the Princeſſe,</hi> the injuſtice of your deſignes, ſince that where
there is a want of the aſſiſtance of men, the very Elements
fight againſt you. We muſt not alwaies, replied <hi>Artaxus,</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
the juſtice of the intentions by the eaſineſſe of the obſtacles
which we meet within the execution of them; and if you lay
that down as a generall rule without any exception, you muſt
conſequently reconcile <hi>Fortune</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> who are ſeldome
found to be very great Friends. I am of your mind as to that,
<hi>replies the Princeſſe,</hi> and if Fortune did take part with juſtice,
and afford her aſſiſtances to vertue, 'tis out of all queſtion that
you had been e're this puniſhed for the violence you do me, or
at leaſt I ſhould not be your Captive. Ah, Madam, <hi>ſaies the
King of Armenia,</hi> do not call her my captive, who her ſelf hath
me in chaines, and dispoſes of me with a ſoveraign power! I
pray give me leave onely to diſpoſe of my ſelf, <hi>ſaies Cleopatra,
interrupting him,</hi> ſince that there's no Law in the world that
gives you any power over me. The Lawes of Nations, <hi>replies
Artaxus,</hi> are of much leſſe authority than thoſe of Love, and
it is onely to theſe latter, that men, ſuch as we are, that like
ſo many ſtars of the greateſt magnitude, are of the higheſt
quality, ought to ſubmit themſelves. By this law of Love,
whatever my paſſion puts me upon, is juſtifiable, and all that I
could alleadge, as concerning the affronts and injuries I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from your houſe hath much leſſe of argument in it than
this imperious reaſon.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was with no ſmall trouble that <hi>Cleopatra</hi> endured, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the diſcourſe but even the preſence of the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi>
and notwithſtanding her reſervedneſſe, no queſtion but ſhe had
treated him with a great deale of ſcorn and contempt, had it not
been out of a conſideration of <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> whoſe condition pitied
her no leſſe than her owne, and a conceit withall, that there was
no way to keep <hi>Artaxus</hi> within the bounds of civility and respect,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:97242:78"/>
but by an exceſſe of patience. Supper was brought them in,
and the King to expreſſe his complyance, permitted them to eat
alone, as knowing they would look on it as a favour, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
by ſuch behaviour to diſſemble the reſolution he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to make uſe of his power, when he were gotten off a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
further from a Countrey where he was not over-confident of
the ſafety of his prize. He ſpent ſome part of the night in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
of the ſame nature with the precedent, and when he
thought it time to leave the Princeſſes to their reſt, he withdrew
into his own chamber, and before he lay down, gave order that
a good ſtrong guard ſhould be ſet in the ſhip, to prevent all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes
the Princeſſes might have to get away in the dark. The
two Princeſſes paſſed away this night as they had done the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
ſave that they were in a much greater feare of their ſudden
departure than before, if it were not prevented by ſome unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
aſſiſtance from heaven and the kindneſſe of the winds,
which did them all the favour they could. <hi>Artaxus,</hi> tormented
with his Love and a fear of looſing his beautifull prize, could
ſleep but little. The unknown perſon diſburthened himſelf of
frequent ſighs which were heard by ſome in the veſſel that were
neareſt him; And <hi>Zenodorus</hi> burſting almoſt with grief and
rage for the loſſes he had received, had much adoe to find any
reſt.</p>
                     <p>The day hardly began to appear, when upon the firſt dawning
of it, thoſe who were upon the watch diſcovered a veſſell,
which being gotten ſomewhat neer them while the darkneſſe was
not yet diſſipated, made all the ſaile ſhe could towards them,
as having a very good wind, that indeed in a manner forced them
upon the ſhore. They immediately gave the alarme, and all
being prepared, and in expectation of an engagement with the
other ſhip, all that were able to bear armes, took them, and
came up upon the deck in order to a fight. There were much
more armes in the ſhip than were requiſite for the number of men
that were in her, inſomuch that the Sea-men who minded onely
the conduct of the ſhip, could not as ſhe then lay be any way em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
as being in ſuch a poſture as they were loath to quit by
reaſon of the advantage of the place, which was ſo advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
that the enemy could not aſſault them but by one onely ſide.
<hi>Zenodorus</hi> and <hi>Megacles</hi> having put all into armes, and there being
as I told you but one ſide to make good, they fortified it with
men, and put it into ſuch a poſture of defence, that it was as
defenſible as if they had had a far greater number of men.
This charge did <hi>Zenodorus</hi> and <hi>Megacles</hi> take upon them, becauſe
of the wounds which the King had received not long before,
whereby he was ſtill a little indispoſed, and would fain have had
him kept his bed; but he would by no meanes take their advice,
by reaſon of the great concernment which he had to make his
party good, and accordingly ſtarting out of his bed upon the firſt
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:97242:78"/>
alarme, he called for armes, and came up upon the deck in the
poſture of a man that wanted not either courage or confidence.
<hi>Zenodorus</hi> and <hi>Megacles</hi> walked up and down the ſhip, putting all
things into good order, and <hi>Artaxus</hi> ſhewing himſelf among his
own people in a poſture of fighting perſonally with them, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to encourage them as well by example as by words. He
omitted nothing of all that he thought might any waies animate
them to fight, and promiſeth them extraordinary rewards, if
they behaved themſelves gallantly, and came off with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                     <p>During all this time the other veſſell drew nearer and nearer,
and when it was come within a competent diſtance, <hi>Zenodorus</hi>
diſcovered by the flag, that it was one of thoſe ſhips that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to the Praetor <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and which ordinarily lay in the
port of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> This diſcovery exasperated him not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
as calling to mind the wounds he had received, and the
great loſſes he had ſuffered by the ſame enemies; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he told <hi>Artaxus</hi> that he need not queſtion but he would be
ſet upon, and that infallibly it was one of the Praetors ſhips pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
ſet out by him in the purſuit of thoſe that had carried
away <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> Upon this diſcourſe, which made ſome of the
company tremble, <hi>Artaxus</hi> reiterated the intreaties he had made
to them to defend themſelves to the utmoſt, and they all promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him, though poſſibly with unequall reſolution; that they
would ſtand to him, to the laſt drop of their blood. The two
Princeſſes, who had awakened at the firſt noiſe that was made,
and had, from what they had diſtinctly heard through the ſhip,
eaſily imagined the truth of what had paſſed, got immediately
out of bed, and betaking them to their devotions prayed the
Gods to ſend them thoſe aſſiſtances whereof they then began to
conceive ſome hopes</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the veſſel of <hi>Egypt</hi> being come up to the
<hi>Armenian,</hi> the perſon that commanded it ſhewed himſelf upon
the deck very well armed, and having made ſome ſigne to ſhew
that he was deſirous to ſpeak with thoſe of the other veſſell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they engaged, aſked for him that commanded the Armenian
veſſell. <hi>Artaxus</hi> having ſhewed himſelf to be the man, and aſked
him what his buſineſſe was with him; <hi>My buſineſſe,</hi> ſaid he to
him, <hi>is to find out the Princeſſe</hi> Cleopatra, <hi>and thoſe that have
carried her away, and if you are any of thoſe, you are either to
reſtore the Princeſſe or prepare to fight. Artaxus</hi> would have been
glad to avoid fighting, as not conceiving himſelf ſtrong enough
to deale with his enemies who very much exceeded him in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
and accordingly making him anſwer, though not without
ſhame and ſome repugnance. <hi>Thoſe whom you ſeek</hi> ſaid he to
him, <hi>are not among us, and there is very little likelyhood that any
people having made ſuch a priſe ſhould ſtay ſo neer</hi> Alexandria.
<hi>What you ſay,</hi> replies the other, <hi>may poſſibly be true, but we ſhall
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:97242:79"/>
not take your word, and therefore muſt ſearch your ſhip, which we
are empowered to do by the orders of the Praetor and the authority
of</hi> Caeſar. Artaxus, ex aſperated at this diſcourſe, and perceiving
there was no way to avoid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ighting; <hi>I am not a perſon to acknowledg
any orders,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>nor know I any authority, that ſhould force me
to commit a baſe action, and therefore if it be fightiag that thou
deſireſt, prepare thy ſelf for it without ſeeking any other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe words were ſpoken ſo loud that they were diſtinctly
heard by the Princeſſe <hi>Cleopatra;</hi> and out of a fear that ſhe was
in leaſt <hi>Artaxus</hi> might perſwade thoſe of the other veſſell with
fair words, and divert them from their intended deſigne, ſhe would
needs ſhew her ſelf to them. Finding therefore the chamber
door faſt, ſhe ran to a little window that was on one ſide of the
ſhip, and opening it as haſtily as ſhe could, ſhe ſhewed them her
beautifull countenance, which ſeemed to ſhine a new day upon
the waves, and lifting up her voice ſo as that ſhe might be heard;
<hi>Here,</hi> generous men, cried ſhe, <hi>here is</hi> Cleopatra, <hi>whom you look
after, I expect my Liberty from your aſſiſtance, and I beg it of you
out of the compaſſion which my misfortune may have raiſed in your
Soules.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There needed no more to ſatisfie all parties ſo as to reſolve
upon what was to be done, inſomuch that ſhe was ſcarce delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of theſe words but the Aegyptian veſſell had faſtned her grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling
irons in the other. The fight upon the firſt onſet was very
terrible, and ſo much the more cruell in that they were come to
handy blowes, thoſe that were come to reſcue the Princeſſe,
having it ſeems purpoſely forborn to make uſe of arrowes out of
a fear they might hurt them. There being therefore on both ſides
a many gallant men, and thoſe animated by conſiderable intereſts
and concernments, they all fought with abundance of valour,
inſomuch that within few minutes the waves were dy'd with
the blood of both parties. With the firſt raies of the riſing Sun
were ſeen the ſwords glittering, and the blowes falling at the ſame
time either on the bucklers oppoſed thereto, or on thoſe unar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
places where the ſteel found its paſſage to diſpatch life. And
whereas <hi>Artaxus</hi> and his men were onely upon the defenſive, and
ſtood to their buſineſſe cloſe and covered with their bucklers,
it was very difficult to force them and ſo to board the veſſell. The
firſt that came on of the enemies was caſt over-board, and there
fell more then one by the hands of <hi>Artaxus</hi> himſelf. He was
gallantly ſeconded by <hi>Zenodorus</hi> and <hi>Megacles,</hi> though this latter
fought with ſome regret upon ſo unhandſome a quarrell. But
after ſome diſpute, the number of their enemies being ſtill grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than theirs, and being alſo better armed than they, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by no leſſe valiant men, and that of <hi>Artaxus's</hi> ſide there
were but twenty fighting men, and the reſt onely ordinary Sea-men
whom they forced to fight both againſt their wills and their
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:97242:79"/>
cuſtome, Fortune began to turn to their ſide who fought for the
liberty of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and their Commander having with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull
blow upon the head laid <hi>Zenodorus</hi> groveling on the
ground, and gained the places which he had forced him to quit,
his companions took encouragement by his example, and victory
ſeemed to declare her ſelf for their ſide.</p>
                     <p>Things were come to this paſſe when the unknown perſon,
who reſted himſelf upon his bed in the bottome of the veſſell, and
perceived that through the reſt he had taken he had recovered
his ſtrength, having heard the noiſe, and at length underſtood
the truth of what was done, immediately got on his cloaths.
And though he ſeemed a perſon little concerned in what was done
in this world, yet, his generoſity being not quite extinguiſhed by
his misfortunes, he thought himſelf obliged to aſſiſt thoſe men,
who had done him ſuch civill offices in his deſpair, and who were
ſet upon in a veſſell wherein he was with them. Poſſeſſed by
this imagination, he ſtood not to reſolve on what he was to doe
in that emergency; ſo that finding his ſword lying by him, he took
it, without any other armes, and comes up on the deck; where
meeting with a buckler at his feet, he covered with it his
left arme, and in that poſture went towards thoſe that were a
fighting. Juſt as he came in were <hi>Artaxus</hi> and his men ready to
quit the place, and their enemies preſſing very hard upon them,
began to board the ſhip in ſeverall places. The unknown perſon
ſtood ſtill a little to conſider how the fight ſtood, and perceiving
what an ill condition they were in whom he was to relieve, he
ran and ſet himſelf in the head of them, and by the firſt blowes
he dealt, let them know that in one ſingle perſon, they had met
with an aſſiſtance far greater than they could have expected. The
two ſtouteſt and moſt forward men of the enemies ſide fell dead
at his feet at two blowes, and ruſhing in upon the reſt with ſuch
a force as they were aſtoniſhed at, he diſperſed the moſt daring,
in ſuch manner, that in a few minutes, he brought the victory
into diſpute which had been before concluded for the other
ſide. <hi>Artaxus</hi> and <hi>Megacles</hi> were immediately ſenſible of this
aſſiſtance which had ſo much changed the face of their affaires,
and, perceiving him to be the gallant unknovvn perſon mentioned
before, becauſe he fought vvithout any thing on his face, and
vvithout any armes other than a ſvvord and a buckler, they
vvere over-joyed at the reliefe they had received in him, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
upon him as ſome miraculous perſon.</p>
                     <p>When he had by the firſt blovves that fell from him ſcattered
the moſt confident of the Enemy, calling <hi>Artaxus</hi> and his men to
him, and encouraging them to proſecute the fight both by his
vvords and example; <hi>Take heart,</hi> ſaid he to them, <hi>gallant men,
fight with me for your own ſafety, and do not fear enemies that
dare not ſtand before you.</hi> Theſe vvords vvere ſeconded vvith
ſuch heavy blovves, that there durſt not an enemy appear before
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:97242:80"/>
him; and <hi>Artaxus</hi> and his men having recovered a little
of their courage at this miraculous aſſiſtance, came up
to him, and began to fight again with abundance of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
                     <p>During all this time, the fair <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> who in a ſtrange diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
expected the ſucceſſe of a fight on which her liberty, and all
the happineſſe of her life depended, after ſhe had ſpent a good
ſpace in prayers to the gods for thoſe that fought for her delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
would needs, if poſſibly ſhe could, ſee them fight, out of an
imagination that they might derive no final encouragement from
her preſence. To this end coming to the chamber door, which,
during the time of the diſorder of the fight, was not guarded, ſhe
found a means to open it, and to get up upon the ſtern of the ſhip.
From thence ſhe ſoon diſcovered how things had paſt, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
much to her grief, that thoſe of her party fled before the
dreadful ſword of the unknown perſon, and thoſe others whom
his example had animated, and that that man, without arms, by a
prodigious valour, ſweeping all that came before him, forced the
others into their Veſſel with much more ſpeed then they had made
to get into that of the King of <hi>Armenia; Wo is my lot,</hi> cryed ſhe
at that fight, overwhelmed with grief! <hi>What man is this that the
gods have armed againſt me, and why, if they are juſt, have they not
made him one of thoſe that came to my reſcue, ſince that I might
with more reaſon expect my ſafety from his ſingle ſword, then from
the aſſiſtance of ſo many men, whom he puts to ſlight? Thus,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
ſhe, ſighing and ſpeaking a little lower, <hi>did, not many
dayes ſince, my unfortunate, or unconſtant</hi> Coriolanus <hi>fight for me,
and with the ſame valour would he fight again, had it but pleaſed
the gods to ſend him to me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>While ſhe thus diſcourſed to her ſelf the unknown perſon,
whoſe valour ſhe ſo much admired, and was withal ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
at, either flung his enemies over board into the ſea, or
forced out of the veſſel what ever ſtood in his way; and, being at
laſt come up to the Commander in chief of the contrary party, who
had fought all this time very gallantly, he burthened him with
ſuch heavy blows, that notwithſtanding his extraordinary valour,
not able to bear them, he was forced to retreat towards his own
veſſel, and had gotten his foot into it, when he receives a blow on
the head from the ſame dreadful hand, which made him fall to
the ground among his own men, who reached out their arms to
ſave him from falling into the ſea. The fall of their Commander,
and the death of the beſt part of their companions, put the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to a loſſe of all courage, and having, as ſoon as they could, got
their ſhip clear from the other, they made all poſſible haſt away,
and would meddle no further with either the victory or relief of
<hi>Cleopatra.</hi> Tis inexpreſſible what affliction it was to the Princeſſe,
to ſee all the great hopes ſhe had conceived vaniſh of a ſudden,
and with what reſentments was ſhe not exaſperated againſt that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:97242:80"/>
valiant, though unknown, perſon, whoſe valour had proved ſo
fatàl to her? She looked upon him ſighing, and when, after he
had ſecured the victory, he turned his face towards that part of
the ſhip where ſhe was, which before he had alwayes had upon
his enemies, ſhe caſt her eies upon him full of tears. But, O celeſtial
powers! What a ſtrange aſtoniſhment, what an incredible ſurprize
was ſhe in, when in the countenance of that deſtable ſtranger
to her, who had been the onely hinderance of her liberty, and
had returned her once more into the power of <hi>Artaxus,</hi> ſhe ſaw
that of <hi>Coriolanus?</hi> Here certainly all expreſſion is too weak to
make the leaſt repreſentation of what ſhe felt upon that cruel
diſcovery, and the ſtrangeneſſe of the accident wrought ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
on her, and put her into ſuch a diſtraction, that having not
the command of her conſtancy for ſome ſmall time, ſhe was upon
the point to caſt her ſelf into the ſea at the ſight of that ungrateful
perſon, and ſo to ſacrifice to him a life which he had made ſo
inſupportable to her, by delivering her up to the moſt cruel
enemie ſhe had in the World. She looked on him for a good
while together, out of a fear ſhe might be miſtaken, and found it no
ſmall difficulty to convince her ſelf of that cruel truth. But at
laſt being ſatisfied that her eies did not deceive her, and that it
was but too too certain that ſhe ſaw no other then the true <hi>Corio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus,</hi>
ſhe was out of all patience ſo far, that ſhe diſcovered her
grief by ſuch circumſtances and demonſtrations of it as ſhe was not
able to conceale, and made the ſhip, and the hollowneſſe of the
adjoyning rock to echo again with the noiſe of her lamentations.
<hi>Is it poſſibe, wickedeſt of men,</hi> cryed ſhe, <hi>that thou ſhouldeſt fight
againſt the liberty of</hi> Cleopatra? <hi>This then is the innocence thou
pretendeſt to, and wouldſt have had me to believe; Or art thou not
ſufficiently ſatisfied with thy former treachery, which had armed the
powers of Heaven and earth againſt thee, but thou muſt commit a
ſecond more deteſtable than the other, by being thy ſelf the inſtrument
to deliver her whom thou hadſt ſo ungratefully forſaken into the hands
of the greateſt of her enemies?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>She had no ſooner begun to ſpeak, but <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> (for it was
really <hi>Coriolanus</hi> himſelf) ſmitten with a voice he was ſo well
acquainted with, had caſt his eies upon her with ſome precipitation,
and perceiving it to be the celeſtial countenance of the Princeſſe
whom he adored, he became as immoveable as a ſtatue of Marble;
and having, from the very firſt words ſhe ſaid, diſcovered the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of his unhappineſſe, that conviction of the malevolence of
his deſtiny, wronght ſo much upon him, that immediately a deadly
ſhivering running all over his body, the ſword fell out of his
hand, his eyes cloſed, and his ſtrength leaving him of a ſuden, he
fell down in a ſwound upon the deck. The incenſed <hi>Cleopatra,</hi>
had not loſt her generoſity, and therefore ſeeing him in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
though ſhe was ſomewhat of opinion that that weakneſſe
might come upon him from ſome wound he had received
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:97242:81"/>
in the fight, ſhe gave thoſe notice that were about him to
have a care of him, ſince he had fought ſo well in their
quarrel.</p>
                     <p>Having ſo done, ſhe found a place to ſit down where ſhe was,
and leaning her amiable face on her two fair hands, ſhe burſt out
into a rivulet of tears, and deplored the ſtrange and extraordinary
misfortune that had happened to her, by ſuch complaints, as no
doubt would have moved any ſoul with compaſſion, unleſſe it
were thoſe of <hi>Artaxus</hi> and <hi>Zenodorus. Artemiſa,</hi> who ſate by
her, would have comforted her, but not being able to do it, ſhe
wept with her for company, and was not afraid to diſpleaſe <hi>Artaxus</hi>
by participating in her lamentations. When the fair Daughter of
<hi>Anthony</hi> had with much adoe diſperſed thoſe ſobs which made
ſome reſiſtance againſt the paſſage of her voice, turning upon
<hi>Artemiſa</hi> thoſe fair eyes, which, though drowned as they were in
tears, ſet all on fire in the ſhip, even to the hearts of unmerciful
Pirates; <q>Ah Siſter, <hi>ſaid ſhe to her,</hi> what fortune was ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
to mine, by what means think you am I fallen into the
hands of <hi>Artaxus,</hi> now the ſecond time! That man whoſe inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
you pleaded ſo much, and were ſo confident of; that
man from whom, inconſtant as I had concluded him, I yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
aſſiſtance, nay, that very man whom you ſaw, not many
daies ſince, fighting ſo valiantly in our defence, by the ſame va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
delivers us up himſelf, and that into his hands from whom
he had before reſcued us, the King, your Brothers. Had it not
been for the aſſiſtance of his fatal valour, we had been freed;
and it was he alone that forced away, nay, haply, killed thoſe
that fought for our liberty. After ſuch an adventure as this,
never diſpute with me again the greatneſſe of our misfortunes,
and find me but one example in the World that may be parallel'd
with this. I do not think it ſtrange, that <hi>Artaxus,</hi> an impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
enemy of our houſe, and one that by his former inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
had diſcovered the malice he hath againſt us, ſhould treat
me with violence and injuſtice: but that he who had ſometime
loved me ſo dearly, whom, to my confuſion, I had loved beyond
my own life, who had ſuffered ſo much for my ſake, and upon
my account, and had been the occaſion that made me ſuffer ſo
much my ſelf, and to be ſhort, that that onely perſon who
ſhould have ſacrificed thouſands of lives for my liberty, ſhould
come and expoſe all he had againſt my friends and againſt my
reſcuers, purpoſely to return me into the chains and power of
<hi>Artaxus,</hi> and not into his own! Ah Siſter, this, this is what no
ages ever produced any thing comparable to, and tis ſuch a
ſtrange accident as I am not well able to comprehend, though
my eyes can but too well witneſſe the truth of what I have
ſeen.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>While <hi>Cleopatra</hi> broke forth into theſe lamentations, and that
<hi>Artemiſa,</hi> aſtoniſhed at the ſtrangeneſſe of the adventure, gave
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:97242:81"/>
her the hearing, and wept with her without making any reply,
<hi>Megacles</hi> and diverſe others were gotten about <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to recover him again, ſome others were employed in caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the carkaſſes over-board, and to dreſſe thoſe that were woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
whereof there was no great number. But before they went
to viſite them, having looked all about the body of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi>
they could not find any wound about him: and, yet though they caſt
water in his face, and uſed ſeverall other remedies, all could not
bring him to himſelf again. <hi>Megacles,</hi> who had the greateſt
reſpect of any for him, made it his buſineſſe very earneſtly to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
him, beſides that when they reflected on the aſſiſtance he had
done all that were in the veſſell, all did accordingly conceive
themſelves obliged to relieve him. <hi>Artaxus</hi> knew not how he
ſhould entertain this ſtrange emergency, and though his firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were inclined to gratitude and acknowledgement, for the
great ſervices he had received from that valiant perſon, yet thoſe
which immediately ſucceeded them began to raiſe a terrible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance
within him. From the words of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> which fell
from her in the violence of her grief, contrary to her ordinary
prudence, he concluded that that man muſt needs be his Rivall.
But that grieved him not ſo much as to conſider that it was a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall
very precious in the affection of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and the hiſtory
of the King of <hi>Mauritania's</hi> Love to that Princeſſe being a thing
known all over the world, from the gracefulneſſe, from the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and from all the other demonſtrations and characters of a
great ſoule that were diſcoverable in that valiant man, he was
eaſily perſwaded that it was <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> and conſequently he that
of all the world ſhould be moſt his enemy, and whom he ſhould
accordingly be moſt jealous of in the love he had for <hi>Cleopatra.</hi>
Yet could he not find in his heart to hate him ſo ſuddenly, as well
for the conſiderable ſervice he had received from him, as that
from ſeverall circumſtances it was very probable he was unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in his affection, and that from the reproaches of infidelity
which the Princeſſe made him, he could infer no leſſe than that
that Prince had ſorſaken her. In this confuſion of imaginations
he was at ſuch a loſſe, that he knew not what reſolution to take,
caſting his eies ſometimes on the Prince that was ſtill in a ſwound,
and ſometimes on the afflicted Princeſſe. Beſides, it being not
his opinion alone, that the unknown was the very ſame perſon he
thought him, it went from one to another, that without queſtion
it was the valiant King of <hi>Mauritania.</hi> So that, coming at laſt to
the eares of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> as incenſed as ſhe was againſt him; yet
was ſhe not a little troubled that ſhe had by her diſcourſe diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him; and yet it being to no purpoſe to recall what is once paſt;
<hi>Yon are in the right,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>it is indeed the King of</hi> Mauritania,
<hi>'tis a perfidious man whom for a double infidelity I am obliged to
hate above all mankind beſides; but he is a Prince, how unconſtant
ſoever he may have proved to me, deſerves your aſſiſtance for the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:97242:82"/>
ſervice he hath but too fortunately done you againſt me, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſince you have made ſome advantage of his treachery, you
have as much reaſon to look after him as I have to abhorre
him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this effect was the diſcourſe of this generous Princeſſe; and
though that in all appearance ſhe ſeemed, not without very much
reaſon, to be incenſed againſt the unfortunate ſonne of <hi>Juba,</hi> and
to have made a ſtrong reſolution not to admit him into her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
again, but to avoid him as much as ſhe could, yet could ſhe
not wiſh his death, nor endure the very thought that he ſhould
die for want of aſſiſtance. 'Twas for this reaſon that ſhe aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
his infidelity before <hi>Artaxus,</hi> purpoſely to make him the leſſe
odious in his ſight, and to divert what after ſuch a diſcovery he
might well fear from the exaſperated <hi>Armenian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Prince was not all this while come to himſelf, and while
<hi>Megacles</hi> was very buſie and took a great deale of paines about
him, one of the <hi>Armenians</hi> being come neer him, and viewing
him with a countenance ſwelled with indignation; <hi>inſtead of the
aſſiſtance you afford this man,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>with ſo much care and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe
we ſhould do well to run our ſwords into his breaſt. This is
the very man that killed our companions not many daies ſince, when
we carried away the Princeſſes; and beſides the lineaments of his
face which I eaſily call to mind again: I have found about his bed
the armes of my Brother whom he unmereifully killed in my preſence.</hi>
This was the diſcourſe of the Barbarian, who could not but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the malicious deſign he had againſt the Princes life, when
<hi>Megacles</hi> hearing it, and having authority over him, gave him
ſuch a look as upon which he immediately took occaſion to be
gone, with ſome threatning geſtures, that ſufficiently argued his
reſentment of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>At laſt, upon the application of ſeverall remedies, the King of</hi>
Mauritania <hi>opens his eies, and became ſenſible, and having gotten
up, he ſcattered his ſcaring and extravagant lookes on all thoſe
that were about him, and, finding</hi> Megacles <hi>one of the neereſt him,
and one that made it moſt his buſineſſe to aſſiſt him, he looked on
him a while in ſuch a manner as if he would expreſſe thereby how
ſenſible he was of his compaſſion and good offices, yet were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
at him for them?</hi> Will you ever be, <hi>ſaid he to him,</hi> the
cruelleſt enemy I have, by taking ſo much trouble upon you as you
do for the preſervation of my life, and ſhould you not rather have
ſuffered me to die, ſince you are one of thoſe that carried away
<hi>Cleopatra.</hi> Charge me not, <hi>ſaid Megacles to him, ſpeaking very
low,</hi> with a crime I have not committed, and confound not thoſe
who do things out of a conſideration of the duty they owe their
Maſters, with thoſe that ſerve them in their moſt unjuſt and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
paſſions, Coriolanus <hi>thought it not fit to make him any anſwer
and perceiving he had recovered his ſtrength again, he gets up,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:97242:82"/>
and looking about for</hi> Cleopatra, <hi>he found her ſitting in the ſame
place where ſhe had continued ever ſince they had given over
fighting. This ſecond ſight of her had almoſt put him into the
ſame condition he had been in before, and reflecting on the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervice
he had done her by oppoſing her deliverance and liberty,
the grief he conceived thereat was ſo great, that he found it no
ſmall difficulty to ſupport it. And yet he thought, that, as things
ſtood, his onely courſe was to muſter up all his courage, and to
ſummon all his vertue to his aſſiſtance, and after the ſhort reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a few minutes, thinking himſelf in a better condition, that
he met with</hi> Cleopatra <hi>in that poſture, than that he ſhould have
loſt her for ever, he took the beſt heart he could, and with a ſlow
pace, ſuch as argued the ſmallneſſe of his confidence, he goes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the place where</hi> Cleopatra <hi>was ſtill ſet. She ſaw him coming
towards her, and her indignation againſt</hi> Coriolanus <hi>being greater
upon the recovery of himſelf, than her pity had been before, ſhe
could not endure he ſhould come neer her, and giving a look
ſufficiently diſcovering her diſpleaſure;</hi> Stay there, barbarous
man, <hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> and come not any more neer a woman whom
thy continuall treacheries expoſe to ſo many misfortunes! What canſt
thou hence forward expect from me, and what further miſchiefe
canſt thou imagine yet to do me, after thou haſt beſtowed me on
the King of <hi>Armenia.</hi> That Prince, inhumane as he is, and though
the greateſt enemy of our houſe, hath not betraied me as thou haſt,
and I am much inclined to believe, that he would not give me to
any other, as thou, with ſo much baſeneſſe, doſt: Leave me therefore
quietly to him, ſince that it is on him that thou haſt beſtowed me,
even with the hazard of thy own life, and aggravate not my affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
with thy abominable preſence. This heart which ſo unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
received for thee thoſe impreſſions whereof it ſhould have
been inſenſible for any other, favoured thee and argued on thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe,
ſeeking out ſomething, by way of juſtification for thee,
while thou wert in armes for <hi>Artaxus</hi> againſt <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> Do not
therefore think it much to afford her that comfort which ſhe may
derive from thy eternall abſence, ſince thou haſt for ever deprived
her of all hope of any other, and imagine not, that after I have
cleared my thoughts of the image of an unconſtant man, they can ever
entertain that of <hi>Artaxus,</hi> for whom no doubt but thou art come to
ſpeake.</p>
                     <p>The dejected and almoſt deſperate <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> leaning againſt
one of the Maſts, hearkened to this violent diſcourſe of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi>
having not the courage to make her any anſwer, and the Princeſſe,
attributing his ſilence to the confuſion he might conceive at the
horrour of his crime, was the more enflamed into indignation,
inſomuch that ſhe could not forbear to diſcover it in further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.
<q>Tell me, cruell man, <hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> by what offence
had I ſo far incenſed thee, as to deſerve the unworthy treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
I receive at thy hands, and, if I were no longer worthy
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:97242:83"/>
the affection thou wert pleaſed ſometime to afford me,
and which had wrought all the pleaſure and felicity of my life,
by what action, or by what defect, am I become ſo odious to
thee, as that thou muſt needs ſacrifice my liberty, life, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments
to the moſt inhumane of all mankind; to him, whom
of all men I ſhould look on as the moſt deteſtable? Or if this
proceed not from any hatred, which I know not how I ſhould
have deſerved at thy hands, upon what account of friendſhip
or intereſt, couldſt thou do <hi>Artaxus</hi> a ſervice ſo diſconſonant
to the precedent actions of thy life, and to that vertue which
thou hadſt ſometimes the reputation to practiſe? Wert thou
reſtored to the throne of thy Predeceſſors by the means of any
aſſiſtances from the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> or wert thou ſo deeply
engaged to him that thou couldſt not any way diſengage thy ſelf
but by preſenting him with that which thou haſt ſometime pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before the Empire of the Univerſe?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus did the diſconſolate daughter of <hi>Anthony</hi> diſcourſe,
while the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> and all thoſe that were about him
gave ſo much ear to what ſhe ſaid, that they had not any of them
the power to interrupt her; and the Prince overwhelmed with
grief and confuſion at the apparent juſtice of her reproaches,
ſuffered the torrent of them to waſt it ſelf without offering to
oppoſe it, and would not have preſumed to open his mouth in
his own juſtification, if the Princeſſe had not given over ſpeaking,
to wipe the teares that fell abundantly from her fair eies. The
dejected ſonne of <hi>Juba</hi> took the advantage of that in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ervall to
rejoyne to her diſcourſe, but it was with no ſmall difficulty that
he made a ſhift to ſpeak, ſo much were his expreſſions in a manner

and by misfortunes ſo far exceeding thoſe of the

the crime you lay to my charge, I cannot deny it, and in an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
ſo unfortunate I cannot ſtand upon my innocency. I
have fought for your enemies, againſt you; I have with all
the ſtrength I was maſter of oppoſed your liberty, and I have
been the meanes of your coming into the hands of a man whom
you would have me look on as the King of <hi>Armenia.</hi> After

innocency, and, when their effects have proved ſo deplorable,

But might it be once the pleaſure of heaven, Madam,
that the former treacheries you charge me withall, and for
which I am undone, were ſo much within the reach of my
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:97242:83"/>
knowledge as this laſt which you reproach me with, I ſhould not
be as miſerable as I am, ſince I ſhould haply find ſomewhat to ſay
for my ſelf by way of juſtification in relation to thoſe, as I can
for this laſt.</q>
                     </p>
                     <q>
                        <p>How is that, wickedeſt of men, <hi>ſaid the Princeſſe, interrupting
him,</hi> doſt thou think to find any thing by way of juſtification for
a crime thou haſt committed in my ſight, or wouldſt thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
me that I have not ſeen thee with thy ſword drawn fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for my enemies againſt thoſe that endeavoured my delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance?
Wouldſt thou dazle my own eyes in this, as thou wouldſt
thoſe of all the World in thy former treachery, or is it thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to perſwade me that I am extravagant and out of my wits?
It is indeed but too too true, replyed <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> that you have
ſeen me with my ſword drawn fighting for your enemies, and I
may preſume to affirm, that I haply made their way to a victory,
which without my aſſiſtance it is likely they had not carried.
It is not therefore my deſign to juſtifie the events, but onely my
own intentions, which if conſidered alone, I dare affirm my ſelf
innocent, if there can be any innocency in an offence whereof the
ſucceſſe hath proved ſo fatal to you. You may be pleaſed to
remember, that there are not many daies paſt ſince I fought in
your defence againſt the ſame enemies, whom I have this day
ſerved, and there is but little likelihood I ſhould ſince that time
have contracted any friendſhip with them to prejudice the love
I have for you. For this man, <hi>ſaid he, looking on Artaxus,</hi> whom
you would have me take notice of as King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> he knows
how that it is but ſome few minutes ſince I firſt ſaw him, and
whether I diſcovered the leaſt deſire to be acquainted with him.
And for thoſe others, <hi>ſaid he, pointing to</hi> Megacles <hi>and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,</hi>
you may have haply learnt from them, whether
they had not recovered me out of the waves into which I
had caſt my ſelf from the top of the rock that covers us,
through the deſpair which the loſſe of you had put me into.
They can further tell you what trouble they had to make me
admit of life, and they know, whether it were out of any other
motive than that of gratitude, and a ſenſe of the obligation I
ought them for their aſſiſtances, that I took up arms in their
quarrel when they were ſet upon. Theſe truths cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to you, all thoſe that hear me are now become my
enemies, ſince they are thoſe that did you violence, and yet I
appeal to them whether I affirm any thing which is not true.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>At theſe words he made a little ſtop, looking about him of all
ſides, and perceiving that <hi>Artaxus,</hi> being much at a loſſe to think
of this adventure, expected to ſee what would be the iſſue of it
without ſpeaking one word, and that all thoſe that ſtood about him
were in the ſame poſture and ſuſpence, continued his diſcourſe
to this effect. <q>I know not, <hi>continued he,</hi> whether I wanted any
love towards you, when I caſt my ſelf headlong into the ſea,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:97242:84"/>
out of the regret it was to me that I could not relieve you, when
it hath been known, that in other very conſiderable misfortunes,
to which my life hath been expoſed, I have never been charged
with want of conſtancy to ſupport them, but theſe very enemies
that hear me, know whether, upon their earneſt intreaties, I have
prolonged my life out of any other deſire then that of making
one attempt more for the ſervice of that perſon to whom the life
they prolonged was devoted.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>As ſoon as <hi>Cleopatra</hi> began to find ſome probability in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> ſhe had heard him very attentively, and out of
the deſire ſhe had that he were innocent, ſhe favoured him in her
heart as much as ſhe could; and, looking on <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> ſeemed as it
were to aſk her, whether ſhe was not alſo in ſome ſort convinced
of the innocency of <hi>Coriolanus? Artemiſa</hi> was very much inclined
to that beliefe without any ſollicitation, and it was onely by reaſon
of the preſence of the King her Brother, that ſhe would not ſpeak
openly in his juſtification.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Coriolanus</hi> deriving a little more confidence
from the ſilence of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> as alſo from thoſe diſcoveries which
he perceived in her countenance of the diſpoſition ſhe was in to
be perſwaded of his innocence, reaſſumed the diſcourſe with an
action that argued a greater ſetledneſſe of mind. <q>You ſee then,
Madam, <hi>ſaid he to her,</hi> what I can ſay for my ſelf, to juſtifie my
intentions: but for the effects, ſince they have proved ſo fatal
in relation to your quiet, and that it is impoſſible to recal what is
paſt, the reparation I am to make you, muſt be extraordinary.
And therefore this very hand that hath done the miſchief, muſt
find out the remedy for it, and this ſword, (<hi>continued he, putting
his hand on the hilt of his weapon, which he had taken into his
own hands when he got up</hi>) this very ſword that hath put you
into the power of the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> ought to bring you out
of it, or take away his life, were it to be done, not onely in this
veſſel, but even in the heart of his kingdom. Tis with this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution

                     <p>
                        <hi>Artaxus</hi> had hitherto, with a great deal of patience heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
to all the diſcourſe that had paſt between <hi>Coriolanus</hi> and
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and was content to hear the Princeſſe charge him
with cruelty, and declare that he was odious in her ſight; but
at this laſt diſcourſe of the Prince of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> he thought
his temerity and confidence inſupportable, and accordingly
looked on him with a malicious and ſcornful ſmile; <q>Corio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus,
<hi>ſaid he to him,</hi> I have paſſed by the firſt affronts I
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:97242:84"/>
have received from thy preſumption, out of a conſideration of
the ſervice thou haſt done me, and I have given thee leave to
ſpeak againſt my concernments with too much liberty, becauſe
thou hadſt defended them with abundance of valour; but now
I perceive thy temerity knows no limits, ſo that it will be hard
for me to obſerve thoſe bounds which I had propoſed to my ſelf
upon the firſt reflections I had made on the aſſiſtance I have
received from thee, and the eſteem I have conceived for thy
perſon.</q>

                        <q>
                           <hi>Artaxus, replyed the valiant Mauritanian,</hi> looking on him
very fiercely, there cannot be any ſuch thing as a mutual eſteem
between us, and if my actions have raiſed any ſuch in thee to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me, haply not without reaſon, thine cannot poſſibly have
the ſame effect upon me. Beſides, it cannot be expected we ſhould
be any longer Friends, not only becauſe thou keepeſt <hi>Cleopatra</hi> as
a captive, but alſo becauſe thou loveſt her. For the ſervice
thou haſt received from me, thou art ſoon di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>engaged as well
by the regret and affliction it is to me that I have done it thee, as
by the little intention I ſhould have had to do it, had I known
thee to be him that carryed away <hi>Cleopatra;</hi> and for the good
office which I received from thy people, when they took me out
of the water, I have ſufficiently requited it, by expoſing my
life for their defence. We are therefore upon equal terms as to
point of obligation, we are equal as to that of extraction, and
if we are unequal as to fortune, it is in the power of Heaven,
who protects juſtice againſt oppreſſion and iniquity, to make our
forces and conditions equal, and to put me once more into ſuch
a way as that I may be able to deliver <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> If it be the
pleaſure of fortune that I periſh in the deſign, expect not thou
ever the more that ſhe will be long at thy diſpoſal, nor indeed
canſt thou be ignorant that the whole Empire is at this preſent
in arms againſt thee, and that, when thou haſt brought the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
into <hi>Armenia,</hi> thou wilt be ſoon followed thither by the
moſt dreadfull forces of the Univerſe, who will deſtroy all
that lies before them by fire and ſword, upon ſo juſt a
quarrel.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Armenian</hi> King was ſilent all this while, as if his aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was no leſſe now at the confidence of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> then it had
been not long before at his valour; and thereupon giving him a
look wherein he ſufficiently diſcovered his indignation; <q>Thou
ſpeakeſt to me, <hi>ſaid he to him,</hi> with as little reſpect, as thou
wouldſt haply do, if thou wert in the head of a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
men, but there is, it may be, ſome flaw in thy memory,
and thou haſt quite forgotten that thou art alone, and without
arms in my ſhip, in the midſt of all my men, and that thou art
already obliged to me for the life which thou haſt enjoyed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my courteſie ever ſince that moment, wherein thou gaveſt
me the firſt occaſion of diſpleaſure. From this very indulgence
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:97242:85"/>
                           <hi>Cleopatra</hi> might infer ſo much as might oblige her to quit the
opinion ſhe hath conceived of my cruelty, and there are few
Kings in the World, who having an abſolute power, ſuch as mine
is, would have ſuffered ſo much from any man, and not have
caſt him into the ſea.</q> 
                        <q>I ſhall caſt my ſelf into the ſea of my own
accord, <hi>replyed the Prince of Mauritania,</hi> when the misfortunes
of my life prove ſo inſupportable as to adviſe me to put a
Period thereto; but thou wilt find, that, to caſt me into the
ſea againſt my will, is not an attempt ſo eaſie in the execution as
thou conceiveſt it. And though thou haſt a great number of men
about thee, yet am I confident that the moſt daring among them
will bethink him more than once what he hath to do ere he
attempt it, and though they ſhould forget all reſpect to the
royal character which I bear as well as thy ſelf, they are better
acquainted with the mettal my ſword is made of, then to come
over-confidently too neer the point of it.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Artaxus</hi> had his hand ready on the hilt of his ſword, and by his
own example was going to oblige all his men to fall upon the King
of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> who ſecuring himſelf with a buckler, expected
them with an undaunted courage, when <hi>Zenodorus,</hi> having reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
himſelf of his fall, and the lethargy occaſioned thereby, and
being come up to him, told him that the wind was turned, and
was very good for their departure thence, and that it was their
beſt courſe to weigh anchor, and be gone from a coaſt, where they
muſt expect to be aſſaulted again if they ſtayed there any time.
<hi>Artaxus</hi> overjoyed at that happy change of weather, gave order to
hoiſe up ſaile, and that they ſhould make what haſt they could
out of the river. But now was it that <hi>Coriolanus</hi> made them know
what he was, and turning toward <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> who heard that order
of <hi>Artaxus</hi> as ſhe would have the ſentence of death paſſed againſt
her; <q>I beſeech you, Madam, <hi>ſaid he to her,</hi> be pleaſed to receive
this laſt ſervice from me without any repugnance, and be aſſured
by the death which I am ſoon to ſuffer for your ſake, what correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence
there hath been between me and the King of <hi>Armenia.</hi>
I do not ſuſpect you guilty of any, <hi>replyed the diſconſolate Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,</hi>
and notwithſtanding the unconſtancy you have been guilty
of towards me, I am better ſatisfied as well of the nobleneſſe of
your bloud, as of that of your courage, then to make a hard
judgement of you in things where there is any one circumſtance
that makes any way for your advantage. But how inconſtant
ſoever you may be, <hi>added ſhe,</hi> riſing from the place where, ſhe
ſate, I am far from deſiring your death, and I ſhall never
give way you ſhould receive it in my ſight, if I can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Coriolanus</hi> had not heard thoſe laſt words, and ſeeing too men
ſomewhat neer him, doing ſomething in order to the departure of
the veſſel, he thruſt away the neereſt to him with ſuch force
that he had turned him over-board into the ſea, and with his ſword
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:97242:85"/>
cleft the others head into two pieces. Upon this ſpectacle <hi>Artaxus,</hi>
perceiving it was not ſafe to dally any longer, and repenting he had
not fallen upon him ſooner, cryed out to his men to haſten to cut
off that temerarious perſon; and when he ſaw himſelf fortified
by thoſe that came about him, he advanced along with them with
his ſword drawn towards the Prince of <hi>Mauritania.</hi> But <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra</hi>
came and ſtood before him, and, ſpeaking to him much more
mildly than ever ſhe had done before, <q>Artaxus, <hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi>
if ever in thy life thou wilt do an action which I may take kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at thy hands, attempt not the life of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> and remember
the aſſiſtance thou haſt received from him, without which I had
been out of thy power, and thou thy ſelf haply out of the
World.</q> 
                        <q>What you deſire of me, Madam, <hi>replies the King of
Armenia,</hi> is a thing out of my power to grant, beſides that <hi>Cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olanus</hi>
himſelf, who, unworthily abuſing the reſpect I have for
you, ſticks not to murder my men before my face, is not deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of that life which you ſo much beg for him. And yet I
ſhall not take it away from him, that I may at length begin to do
ſomething that pleaſes you, and though he be my Rival, and
that one ſo much the more to be feared for that he is much in
your favour, yet ſhall I permit him to live, and give him leave
to depart immediately, out of the ſhip, and go his waies whither
it ſhall pleaſe fortune to diſpoſe of him.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>If there be any favour in this, <hi>replies the Mauritanian,</hi> it were
done to thy ſelf and not to me, nor indeed do I make the leaſt
doubt of it, but that thou wouldſt be very glad I were once out of
thy ſhip; but thou art not guilty of ſo much vanity as to imagine
I will go hence without the Princeſſe <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and therefore
reſolve immediately either to reſtore her to liberty, or to give

not but I ſhall even in the midſt of all thy men, put once more
into danger.</q> 
                        <q>Alas! for death, <hi>cries out Artaxus, being grown

                     </p>
                     <p>With this <hi>Rhodomantade,</hi> having not the patience to give any
further ear either to his words, or the cries of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> whom he
cauſed to be taken away by force from between their arms, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to make towards the Prince, who, having got to a place
whence he could not be aſſaulted, but onely before, covering his
left arm with a buckler, and brandi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>g his dreadful ſword with
the right, expected him in ſuch a poſture as ſpoke him a perſon
whom no danger could frighten. <hi>Artaxus</hi> was both valiant and
daring; but beſides that, he was not abſolutely recovered of his
wounds, and felt himſelf a little too weak to engage in a combat,
the great actions he had ſeen him do that day againſt the enemy
that would have reſcued <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> made him look on that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:97242:86"/>
with ſome diſtruſt, and accordingly was not much diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to ſee the ſtouteſt of his men expoſe themſelves before him to
that danger. <hi>Zenodorus,</hi> followed by the reſt of his companions,
and ſome of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> animated by him whoſe Brother the
valiant Prince had killed ſome daies before, was the firſt that
would venture to come on. <hi>Megacles,</hi> not able to divert this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
would not however have any hand in the crime, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his armes acroſſe at the other end of the ſhip, did all that lay
in his power to perſwade to ſtay with him ſuch of the <hi>Armenians</hi>
as had moſt affection for him. <hi>Ariſtus,</hi> who was the firſt that
offered at the King of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> was alſo the firſt that paid for
his confidence; for, having made a blow at the Prince, and he
putting it off with his buckler, he received another from him by
way of exchange, which taking him in the throat, cut off the
paſſage of his reſpiration. For the bloud, iſſuing out of his
wound in thick clots, choaked him within a few minutes, and
after he had ſtaggered ſome paces backwards, ſpreading his arms
aſunder, he fell down and breathed out his laſt at the King of
<hi>Armenia</hi>'s feet. Had <hi>Cleopatra</hi> delighted in revenge, and that a
bloudy revenge, here ſhe might with no ſmall pleaſure have looked
on this victime which the Prince ſacrificed to her, ſince it was this
man that had ſeized her, and carried her in his armes into the
ſhip.</p>
                     <p>This ſudden diſpatching of <hi>Ariſtus</hi> did a little cool the courage
of his companions; but it withall animated them to revenge him;
and the King, who had loved <hi>Ariſtus</hi> very dearly, being extreamly
grieved at his fall, cryed out to his men to take heart, and would
have been in the head of them, had he been in his abſolute
ſtrength, and if ſome of his own, who would not have him to
hazard his life, had not ſtood in his way. But this they did partly
out of a deſire to pleaſe him, and the fear they were in at the ſight
of <hi>Coriolanus</hi>'s dreadful ſword, and partly out of a certain repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
they felt in themſelves to put to death a valiant Prince, who
not long before had ſo generouſly hazarded his life for their ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Thoſe that were the moſt forward to ſecond <hi>Ariſtus,</hi> met
with a deſtiny, not much different from his, and he who was ſo
violent to be revenged for his brothers death, coming on a little
too raſhly, loſt his reſentments, with his life, by a thruſt which
for want of arms found a way into his belly, and which made him
fall down into a rivulet of his own bloud. The deaths of theſe
two men made their companions more circumſpect, and more fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of the length of <hi>Coriolanus</hi>'s ſword. The valiant Prince look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on them with a certain contempt, and frightning them the
more by menacing geſtures; <hi>It is not ſo eaſie a matter,</hi> ſaid he to
them, <hi>as you conceived it, to take away a mans life, who knows how
to defend it, the advantage of number and arms does not alwaies bring
victory with it, and if I dy this day, as it is poſſible I may, by your
hands, if the gods have ſo diſpoſed of me, I hope I ſhall not dy unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="167" facs="tcp:97242:86"/>
Having ſaid theſe words to them, he kept his former poſture,
that is, ſtood cloſe to the ſhips ſide to avoid being ſet upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
and warding off the blowes which were made at him with
his buckler, he looked like lightning on his enemies, and when
any one of them inſtigated either by ſhame or the cries of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxus</hi>
grew more daring then his companions, he neglected not
either time or occaſion to make him repent his forwardneſſe, and
alwaies directed his ſword ſo fortunately and with ſuch force
and execution, that it ever proved either the meſſenger of death
or ſome cruell wound. At laſt <hi>Zenodorus,</hi> to whom this kind of
engagement was more familiar than to any of the reſt, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
to fight with ſo much precaution againſt a ſingle perſon,
and deſirous to let the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> ſee how much he deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the aſſiſtance he had promiſed him, after he had called his
companions about him, and reproached them with their
cowardice and baſeneſſe, comes on before them, and, intending
to direct his ſtroke at the Princes bare head, <hi>Coriolanus</hi> warded
it off with his buckler. But, having many adverſaries to deale
with, and they directing ſeverall blowes at him at the ſame time,
he could not ſo well put off that of the Pirate, but that his ſword
ſliding down along the buckler fell upon his ſhoulder, and gave
him a ſlight wound. <hi>Zenodorus</hi> perceiving the Prince to be in
ſome diſorder, would needs be at him again, and taking his ſword
with both hands, he lifted it up high in the air, with a deſigne
and hope to cleave the Prince his head aſunder; but at the very
ſame time the ſon of <hi>Juba,</hi> exaſperated at the blow he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
gave him a back-blow with ſuch force, that the edge
of the ſword meeting with the Pirate at the wriſts, which were
not covered with any armes, cut them both off, ſo that both
hands and the ſword fell down at the feet of thoſe that were
fighting. The unfortunate <hi>Zenodorus,</hi> ſeeing himſelf in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
condition, was loath to live any longer, whether that
ſtrange misfortune raiſed in him an averſion for life, or that he
was perſuaded that through his cruell wounds it would have run
out with blood. So that having remained ſome little while as it
were in an irreſolution what to do, and ſent forth a dolefull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
towards heaven, he of a ſudden flies at the Prince,
with a deſigne to thruſt him over-board into the ſea. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
he might have effected it, if the Prince perceiving he made
towards him, had not ſtepped aſide with ſo much agility, that
the deſperate Pirate not meeting with any thing to ſtay him,
and thruſting forwards with the whole weight of his body fell
over the veſſell into the Sea, where having no hands to do him
any ſervice in point of ſwimming, or to faſten on any thing if
need were, he was ſoon drowned, looſing his life after a little
ſtrugling, the laſt word that fell from him being the name of <hi>Eliſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
it being a certain juſtice in the Gods that he ſhould expire in
that Element upon which he had committed ſo many crimes, and
was grown ſo dreadfull to all the world.</p>

                        <hi>The misfortune of</hi> Zenodorus <hi>took off much of the ſpirit and
eagerneſſe of his companions, which had been the moſt animated
by his example; but on the other ſide it put</hi> Artaxus <hi>into ſo much
rage and violence, that being not any longer able to forbear ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
out of fear or any other conſideration, he came up to the
moſt forward of his men, reſolved to periſh himſelf or to take
away his enemies life.</hi> What, cowardly villaines, <hi>cryed he to his
own men,</hi> you are afraid and give back for a ſingle perſon, and you
ſuffer the ſtouteſt of your companions to be killed before your faces
and are not able to revenge them? O ſhame beyond expreſſion, the
ſtaine whereof neither all his blood nor all ours is able to waſh off!
O <hi>Zenodorus, added he,</hi> ſince thou haſt in my quarrell loſt a life,
which thou hadſt preſerved among ſo many dangers, and among ſo
many misfortunes, if I cannot make that ſatisfaction to thy Manes
which I ought them, receive at leaſt that victime which I now ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to thee.</p>
                     <p>With theſe words he comes on full of fury, when the moſt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate
of his men caſt themſelves before him, and kept the
Prince ſo much in play, that there was little probability, with
all his valour, he ſhould long defend a life ſet upon by ſo
great a number of enemies, and that with ſo much eagerneſſe and
animoſity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alas! how can we imagine the diſconſolate</hi> Cleopatra <hi>was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
while they were engaged in this unequall combate; and
with what abundance of teares did ſhe bewayle the loſſe of a
Prince whom ſhe ſaw periſhing upon her account, and that a Prince
who, notwithſtanding the pretended infidelity laid to his charge,
was dearer to her than her own life? What endeavours did ſhe
not uſe to divert his enemies from their inhumane enterpriſe? But
when ſhe perceived that all her intreaties and ſollicitations proved
ineffectuall, as to the expectation ſhe conceived from them, what
complaints, and what regrets did ſhe not importune heaven with,
ſince that, in her misfortune, her lamentations and teares were all
ſhe could afford, and indeed all that Fortune had left her? She
embraced the comfortleſſe</hi> Artemiſa, <hi>whoſe teares were mingled
with hers, and preſſing her, with an action that ſpoke the height
of paſſion;</hi> Now Siſter, <hi>ſaid ſhe to her,</hi> now, may you ſee the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of my cruell and unfortunate deſtiny, now may you ſee the
moſt extraordinary effects of heavens indignation, that ever fell
upon any wretch in this world. After the infidelity of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi>
after the loſſe of my liberty, and after the affliction it muſt needs
be to me to ſee my ſelf returned into captivity by no other hand than
his whom I loved ſo much, all the miſery I could further expect, was,
to ſee the ſame Prince whom I loved ſo dearly cruelly deſtroyed in
my ſight, and periſhing in our defence. If it muſt needs be the
pleaſure of the Gods that he ſhould die in my preſence, it had been
ſupportable to me that he had done it while he was yet in his miſtake
and fought for our Enemies, and that to the former infidelity I
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:97242:87"/>
might not reproach him with this laſt, which he hath now ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cleared himſelf of. But the gods thought not fit to leave me that
conſolation in his loſſe, and would needs make his innocence appear
as to this laſt crime, whereof I might otherwiſe have accuſed him, as
if it had been done purpoſely that my grief for his loſſe might be the
more inſupportable.</p>
                     <p>But Siſter, <hi>ſaid</hi> Artemiſa <hi>to her, whenever the importunity of
her teares made any intervall in her diſcourſe,</hi> can you be ſtill of
opinion, that this man whom you ſee fighting with ſo miraculous a
valour for your deliverance; that he, that ſhould caſt himſelfe head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
from the top of a reck into the ſea, meerly becauſe he would
not ſurvive your loſſe and indignation; and that hath refuſed before
us the life which <hi>Artaxus</hi> was content to leave him, purpoſely, that
he might ſacrifice it to your ſervice, can be a treacherous and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
perſon; and will you not quit that opinion upon ſo many ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
demonſtrations of his fidelity and his affection? No doubt,
Siſter, but I ſhould have other thoughts of him, <hi>replies Cleopatra,</hi>
if in the diſcovery he made to me of his treachery he had not been
ſo cruell as to deprive me of all matter of hope, and not leave me any
circumſtance whence I might argue any thing on his behalfe. But, I
beſeech you; let us have no farther diſpute about his innocence, ſince
that if he be found innocent, I ſhall be ſo much the more unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
and that it muſt needs be more inſupportable to me to looſe
him innocent, then to ſee him die in his unconſtancy. <hi>And yet
Siſter, though I ſee my grief muſt needs be the greater, yet can I
not forbear wiſhing him innocent, and therefore whatever he
may be, whether innocent or guilty, whether loved or hated
by me, might it pleaſe the Gods that I could redeem his life
with the ſacrificing of my own, and that thoſe Barbarians
that aſſault him, would turn their ſwords againſt my breaſt
ſo they would ſpare a life which is ſo deare to me as
his.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The conſequence of theſe words was a torrent of teares,
which when it had almoſt ſpent it ſelfe, ſhe lifts up her eies
towards heaven, and reaſſuming her diſcourſe;</hi> O ye juſt
powers of heaven, <hi>cryed ſhe,</hi> are you then reſolved to expoſe
vertue to rage and cruelty, and ſhall heaven be turned into braſſe
onely againſt my addreſſes, when it is open to the Lamentations
and cries of other wretches that call upon the gods?</p>
                     <p>Theſe words were hardly underſtood by <hi>Artemiſa</hi> and <hi>Mega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
who deſirous to have no hand in that unjuſt combat was
come into the room where the Princeſſes were to comfort them
as well as he could, but there was ſuch a horrid noiſe in the ſhip
about one ſingle perſon, that there could not well be a greater,
had there been a fight between divers ſhips. That put <hi>Cleopatra</hi>
in a manner out of all hope of ever ſeeing <hi>Coriolanus</hi> alive long,
when caſting her eye towards the ſea, as ſhe did every minute
almoſt to ſee whether there were any thing coming to their
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:97242:88"/>
aſſiſtance, ſhe diſcovered a ſhip making all the ſaile ſhe could. That
ſight recruited her heart with ſome hope again, eſpecially when
ſhe perceived by degrees with <hi>Artemiſa</hi> and <hi>Megacles,</hi> who alſo
obſerved her courſe, that the ſhip tacked about and came di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
towards theirs, and was not at that time ſo far from it, but
that it might come up time enough to relieve the Prince, if he
would but ſtand it out as long as he could. To that end ſhe thought
fit to communicate that hope to him, and accordingly ſpeaking to
him as loud as ſhe could, by reaſon of the noiſe and diſorder;
<hi>Take heart Coriolanus,</hi> cryed ſhe to him, <hi>the gods have ſent you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
husband your ſtrength ſo as to expect it, and do not caſt
your ſelf away through deſpaire, when it is yet in your power to
hope.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe words of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> wrought on him the effect ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
they ſhould, and by a certain miracle multiplying the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
fractions of courage which were yet left in the Son of
<hi>Juba,</hi> when his ſtrength was upon the point to forſake him, they
obliged him to have a greater care of his life then he had had
before. Five or ſix of his enemies were laid with their bellies
upward at his feet, and made, as it were, a kind of a rampart againſt
the reſt, who, notwithſtanding the cries of <hi>Artaxus,</hi> and their own
great reſolution, were afraid to meddle with him, and thought it
greater prudence to expect till wearineſſe had made him incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of fighting any longer, that they might accordingly kill him
with leſſe danger. <hi>Artaxus</hi> was ſomewhat of the ſame opinion
himſelf, out of a confidence he had that he could not eſcape him,
and finding in himſelf, that his ſtrength, grown much leſſe by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of his wounds, was not proportionable to his fury, as he could
have wiſhed, he was content to remit ſomewhat of his rage, and
to have a little patience with him.</p>
                     <p>But, having at the exclamation of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> caſt his eye about
him on the ſea, and ſeen the ſhip making towards them, which he
could not take for any other than an enemy, the violence of his
grief was inexpreſſible, inſomuch, that retreating ſome few paces
full of confuſion and aſtoniſhment, he was for ſome minutes at
ſuch a loſſe, that he ſtood immovable, and incapable of all reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The firſt imagination that came into his mind, was, that he
could not be in a condition to ſtand an engagement with thoſe that
came againſt him, eſpecially, when the men he had leſt, found it
ſuch a difficulty to take away the life of a ſingle perſon: ſo that
he was in a fear both of looſing <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> without whom he did
not much care for life, and alſo to looſe that very life againſt
which he had armed ſuch powerful enemies. Poſſeſſed with this
fear, he looked all about him, and perceiving he was at no great
diſtance from the ſhore, he had ſome thought to quit the ſhip, and
accordingly to avoid a fight which muſt needs prove diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
to him upon the ſea. But this reflection was no ſooner in
his mind, but he conſidered withall that that flight into the land,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:97242:88"/>
beſides the diſhonour of it, would prove fruitleſſe, and that,
though he ſhould with much ado get aſhore, yet could he not
get <hi>Cleopatra</hi> out of the veſſel till he had diſpatched <hi>Coriolanus</hi>
out of the way. Nay all this granted as poſſible, and that he were
delivered of that obſtacle by the death of the Prince, he conceived
himſelf leſſe ſafe upon the land than he was upon the ſea, it being
in a Country where all things were at the command of his enemies,
and where he was not likely to meet with any retiring place for
himſelf, or any to conceal <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> whom he could not think of
forſaking without death.</p>
                     <p>Theſe difficulties, with a many others, coming immediately
into his imagination, made him ſoon quit the deſign he had at firſt
framed to himſelf, and thereupon he took an abſolute reſolution
to fight it out, and to defend his beautiful prize to the very laſt
gaſp. In this reſolution, looking up to heaven with eyes ſparkling
with indignation, and an action expreſſing the very depth of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair;
<hi>Though gods and men,</hi> cryed he, <hi>and all the elements combine
to ruine me, yet ſhall they not abate a jot of my courage, and if I muſt
periſh, implacable deſtinies! you ſhall find I can do it without either
baſeneſſe or remorſe.</hi> With theſe words, he returns to <hi>Coriolanus,</hi>
as conceiving it abſolutely neceſſary that he ſhould be diſpatched
out of the way before the enemy were come up; and thinking
it now paſt time to dally, and that he was to make all the haſt he
could with him, he comes up to him in ſuch manner, that the
Prince, after he had warded off certain blows which the other had
made at him, ſtruck him over the head with all the ſtrength he
had. The goodneſſe of the head-piece ſaved him from death;
but it was not able to hinder him from being ſtunnied in ſuch wiſe,
that after he had ſtaggered a while, he fell down within ſome few
paces of the Princeſſe <hi>Cleopatra. Megacles</hi> ran immediately to help
him, and <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> out of the excellency of her good nature, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
what ſhe ought her own bloud, came to him, and took
up the viſour of his head-piece, to give him a greater freedom of
breathing, and more aire.</p>
                     <p>While he continued in that condition, <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> running to
thoſe that were ſtil fighting againſt <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> and who poſſibly,
notwithſtanding his miraculous reſiſtance, would have diſpatched
him at laſt, comes up to them without any fear, and liftng up her
voice that ſhe might be the better heard; <hi>Hold your hands,</hi> ſaid ſhe
to them, <hi>and if you expect any favour from thoſe whom you ſee coming
to our aſſiſtance, make no further attempt on the life of a Prince,
on whom your own, will, within theſe few minutes, depend. Tis the
onely way you have left you to ſecure your lives, for you are not to
hope for any mercy, if you be take you not to your own Prince, and by
complyance make your ſelves worthy the pardon which I promiſe you.</hi>
Theſe words proved effectual upon ſome part of thoſe that heard
them, and particularly upon the <hi>Armenians,</hi> who were moſt of
them perſons of conſiderable quality. Theſe were content to do
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:97242:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as the Princeſſe would have them, and, giving over ſighting, went
to ſee how their King did: but the Pirates, in whom the death of
their leader, and the deſpaire of pardon wrought a different effect,
were obſtinate in the deſigne they had conceived to take away
<hi>Coriolanus</hi>'s life, and, though there were but one half of them
left, yet deſpaired not of revenging the death of <hi>Zeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Prince, perceiving himſelf eaſed, not onely of the greateſt
part of this enemies, but alſo of the moſt dangerous and moſt
valiant, valewed not much thoſe that remained; and though he
muſt needs be very much weakned, as well by the continual action
he had been in, as by ſome ſlight wounds he had received, yet
was he now in greater hopes than ever of gaining the victory, and
delivering <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> In the mean time, <hi>Artaxus,</hi> who had onely
been ſtunned with the heavy blow he had received, comes at length
to himſelf, by the aſſiſtance they had given him; but ere he had
ſo far recovered himſelf as to know all that were about him,
and become maſter of his ſtrength, that is, before he was in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to diſcern what paſſed in the ſhip, and to give out orders
about any thing, the other that was coming in to the aſſiſtance of
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and which had already been known to be one of thoſe
of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> was gotten ſo neer, that they could hear them
hollow that were within her, and in a manner diſcern their
faces.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Artaxus</hi> having got up, and taken his ſword again, looked about
him of all ſides, and perceiving that all his hopes were vaniſhed,
he was convinced his final ruine was at no great diſtance. He
ſighed again for very grief and rage, as conceiving himſelf not to
be in a condition either to execute his revenge, or keep <hi>Cleopatra</hi>
in his poſſeſſion, and therefore was at ſuch a loſſe and irreſolution,
that he knew not what ſide to take. While in the interim, the
other ſhip came on ſtill with ſuch ſpeed and ſuch hollowing, that
it was out of all queſtion ſhe was an enemy, and indeed within a
few minutes after <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> perceived, in the head
of thoſe that were coming to their aſſiſtance, Prince <hi>Marcellus</hi> and
Prince <hi>Alexander,</hi> who, that they might be known to the Princeſſes
had raiſed up the viſours of their head-pieces. If <hi>their</hi> joy was
extraordinary, the grief of <hi>Artaxus,</hi> who, upon the firſt ſight knew
<hi>Alexander,</hi> was no leſſe violent. He blaſphemed againſt Heaven,
and railed at his evil fortune, and that hateful ſight filled him no
doubt, upon the firſt apprehenſion thereof, with fatal reſolutions.
<hi>We muſt periſh,</hi> cryed he, <hi>but it is but juſt we bury under our ruines
thoſe that ſhould derive any felicity from our deſtruction. And for
thy part,</hi> Alexander, <hi>ſaid he, loud enough to be heard by him, aſſure
thy ſelf thou ſhall not laugh at the defeat of</hi> Artaxus. With theſe
words he comes up to the two Princeſſes, and looking on them with
eyes red with bloud and fire, he put them into a greater fright
then ever they had known before; <hi>See here,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>theſe are
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:97242:89"/>
either my</hi> ſecurity, <hi>or my</hi> victimes: <hi>what ſhall eſcape my</hi> love, <hi>ſhall
never eſcape my</hi> revenge, <hi>and if it be loſt to me, it ſhall be loſt to
all the World beſides.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As he uttered theſe words, he took <hi>Artemiſa</hi> in the left hand,
and with the right preſenting the point of his inhuman wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
to the fair breaſt of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> he directs his fatal looks on
<hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Marcellus</hi> juſt at the inſtant that they were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all things to faſten the grappling-irons, and addreſſing his
ſpeech to the Son of <q>
                           <hi>Anthony: Alexander, ſaid he to him,</hi> hope
not thou ſhalt have any thing to rejoyce at in the misfortune of
thy enemy, and think not to triumph over me ſo many ſeveral
wayes as thou haſt, through the malice of my fortune, and the
perfidiouſneſſe of <hi>Artemiſa.</hi> It was through the baſeneſſe of
this Princeſſe that ſhe ever came into thy power, and the reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gods have been pleaſed that <hi>Cleopatra</hi> ſhould fall into mine;
but if my Siſter hath been too ſuſceptible of thy love, thine
hath been too ungrateful to entertain the affection I have had
for her. Thou returneſt again conducted by that Fortune which
hath ever been in hoſtility againſt me, with a deſign, and haply
in a condition to force them both out of my hands: but know,
that thy hope hath deluded thee, and all thou art to expect from
this enterprize, is the death of theſe two Princeſſes. Thou
maiſt ſave their lives by directing thy courſe ſome other way, and
leaving me at liberty to purſue mine: but if thou loſeſt a ſingle
minute in conſidering what reſolution thou ſhoulſt take, thou
ſhalt find me aready reſolved to ſheath this ſword in the breaſts
of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and <hi>Artemiſa.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Armenia</hi> had made this diſcourſe without the leaſt
interruption, while <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſeeing him in that cruuel poſture
againſt the Princeſſes, had given order to thoſe that were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to faſten the ſhip, to forbear, and ſtood in a confuſion, and
abſolutely at a loſſe what to think of ſo terrible a ſpectacle. Upon
the firſt ſight of that Barbarian, and his inhuman attempt, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
would have broke out againſt him with all its violence;
but fearing, on the other ſide, by his precipitation, to loſe what
was a thouſand times dearer to him then his own life, his love
tyed up his hands, with conſiderations as ſtrong as the other, and
kept him in an irreſolution full of perplexity. Thence it was,
that he not onely forbore interrupting <hi>Artaxus</hi> while he ſpoke,
but alſo when he had given over, was not able to make him any
reply, and onely looked on him with much confuſion, and as if he
had been in a trance. <hi>Marcellus</hi> was alſo afraid for <hi>Cleopatra,</hi>
whom he loved as dearly as he could a Siſter, but his ſoul being
not, upon this occaſion, capable of ſuch a violence of paſſion as
was that of <hi>Alexander,</hi> he was guilty of a greater freedom of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion,
and conſequently was the leſſe troubled at the horrour
of that object. Hence was it that he took occaſion to ſpeak while
the other was ſilent, and darting on <hi>Artaxus,</hi> a look expreſſing
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:97242:90"/>
the greatneſſe of his indignation; <q>Barbarous wretch, <hi>ſaid he to
him,</hi> if the ſight of thoſe divine beauties cannot ſtay thy hands,
conſider what will become of thy own life in that horrid at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
and doubt not but thou ſhalt looſe it by the moſt exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
torments that humane invention ever found out, if thou exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
thy barbarous reſolution.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Armenian ſmiled at this diſcourſe of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
on him very ſcornefully, <q>Do not imagine, <hi>ſaid he to him,</hi>
that thou canſt frighten me with thy menaces, or that I ſtand in
any fear of death my ſelf, after I have given it to what I love
beyond my ſelfe; but if thou with <hi>Alexander</hi> art deſirous of
the ſafety of theſe Princeſſes, reſolve immediately to do as I
would have you, for fear your reſolutions come too late.</q> Ah!
ſaies <hi>Alexander</hi> to him, aſſuming the diſcourſe at laſt, will thy
cruelties never have any end, and wilt thou treat me with more
inhumanity upon the ſea of <hi>Alexandria</hi> then thou didſt upon
the ſcaffold at <hi>Artaxata?</hi> Thus did he ſpeak to him, as
much out of tenderneſſe as indignation, when the couragious <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opatra,</hi>
out of a jealouſy that that ſoftneſſe might prove preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall
to her liberty, and ſtanding leſs in fear of death then of her
captivity, and the importunate Love of the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi>
brok that ſilence which ſhe had obſerved all the time before, and
looking on <hi>Alexander</hi> with a countenance that argued much more
confidence than his: <q>Brother, <hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> have a greater rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
on the gods then to forſake us upon the vain frights which
<hi>Artaxus</hi> would put us into. He dares not put us to death, but
though we were to expect it, we think it much more ſupportable
then the life he prepares for us.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Artaxus</hi> was in a manner ſatisfied that theſe words of <hi>Cleopatra</hi>
would have that effect on the ſpirit of <hi>Marcellus</hi> and that of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
as ſhe expected they ſhould, and fearing to be ſurprized, he
lifted up his arme as he drew near to <hi>Cleopatra</hi> (who was gotten
ſome paces from him) either to frighten them the more, or poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to execute his bloody reſolution. But, as happy fortune would
have it, at the very ſame inſtant of time, the valiant ſon of <hi>Juba,</hi>
who was fighting at the other end of the ſhip againſt thoſe that
were left of the Pirates, had, notwithſtanding their finding him ſo
much employment, (minding the ſafety of Cleopatra much more
than his own) partly taken notice of what was paſt: Tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at the imminent danger he ſaw her in, and perceiving it was
not now a time for him to be ſo mindfull of his own life, broke
through thoſe enemies that ſtood in his way, and laying on the
ground all that any way oppoſed him, he got up to the King of
<hi>Armenia</hi> with ſo much ſpeed, that, before he was ſenſible of his
coming, he gave him a thruſt with ſuch force that he laid him at
his feet and tumbled him upon the deck to one fide of the veſſell.
<hi>Artaxus</hi> made a ſhift to get upon again, bet e're he could do it,
<hi>Coriolanus</hi> was gotten before <hi>Cleopatra</hi> in a condition to defend
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:97242:90"/>
her, while in the mean time <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Marcellus</hi> in taking
their advantage of this intervall had cauſed their ſhip to cloſe
with the other, and, notwithſtanding the oppoſition of the <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
and the <hi>Pirates,</hi> who joyned with them with abundance of

                     </p>
                     <p>This fight, as it was undertaken upon a barbarous occaſion, ſo
was it managed with more animoſity than ordinary, and upon that
account was it that there was ſome blood ſpilt, which upon another
occaſion had haply, through the clemency of the Chiefs, been
ſpared. The Aegyptian ſouldiers that followed <hi>Alexander</hi> put all
they met with in their way, to the ſword; but that Prince and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi>
ſcorning a victory too eaſily gained, ran to <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and
<hi>Artemiſa,</hi> and if love obliged the ſon of <hi>Antony</hi> to mind in the
firſt place what he moſt loved, Friendſhip had in a manner the
ſame effect upon the ſon of <hi>Octavia. Alexander,</hi> full of fury and
indignation ran towards <hi>Artaxus,</hi> whom rage had put upon the
laſt and moſt violent attempts, and who muſt needs have expected
the execution of a juſt revenge; but <hi>Artemiſa</hi> ſtepped before
him, and ſpeaking to her deareſt <hi>Alexander</hi> with her natural good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
<q>Alexander, <hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> put not to death the King
my Brother, and ſatisfie your ſelfe with the victory and poſſeſſion
of <hi>Artemiſa. Alexander</hi> let fall the point of his ſword at this
diſcourſe, and looking on the Princeſſe with an action full of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and reſpect; <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>had not you laid your

<hi>both the blood of</hi> Artemiſa <hi>and the dignity of a King.</hi>
                        </q> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
turning to <hi>Artaxus,</hi> who, ſwelling with rage and confuſion,
and overpreſſed with grief and wearineſſe, ſate upon the deck,
whence darting his ſcattered lookes of all ſides, his thoughts ran
upon what was moſt barbarous and horrid. <q>King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> ſaid
he to him, thou ſhalt receive from us what thou haſt never gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
any one, and what indeed thou ſhouldſt not expect, if thou
call to mind that cruell ſcaffold upon which my head was once
made a publick ſpectacle. We leave thee thy life, and abſolute
liberty to diſpoſe of thy ſelf as thou pleaſeſt, and deſire no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
advantage than that of delivering <hi>Artemiſa</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra</hi>
out of thy cruell hands. From this difference of carriage, thou
maiſt reflect on what there is between us, and from the ill
ſucceſſe of thy enterpriſes infer what horrour and vengeance
the good and juſt powers of heaven have for thy violences and
cruelties.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this effect was the diſcourſe of <hi>Alexander</hi> when the King of
<hi>Armenia,</hi> looking on him with eies wherein the rage which poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him was viſibly apparent; <q>Be not ſo fond as to imagine,
<hi>ſaid he to him,</hi> that I will accept of a life from the ſon of <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
the Cajoller of <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> and the brother of <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> Thy
very birth made thee my enemy, thy crime armed me againſt
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:97242:91"/>
thee, and thy Siſter, by the little regard ſhe had for my love,
hath deprived me of all the deſire I could have had for life.
Think not then that I will owe it to him who hath occaſioned
me ſo many misfortunes, or ſurvive the hope I now loſe both
of being revenged of thee, and poſſeſſing <hi>Cleopatra.</hi>
                        </q> With
theſe words he riſes with his ſword in his hand from the place
where he was ſet, and rowling his dreadful eyes about him, gave
all notice as it were of the horrid reſolution he had taken. The
two Princeſſes, who were beſt acquainted with his furious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
ran behind their defenders, and the Princes ſet themſelves
before them in a poſture to oppoſe <hi>Artakus,</hi> if he ſhould attempt
any thing. The cruel King having conſidered his weakneſſe, and
the little probability there was he ſhould execute what his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
inſpired him with, hearkened to the temptation of his
evill genius, and after the ſilence of a few minutes; <hi>Implacable
Fortune,</hi> ſaid he at laſt, <hi>thou ſeeſt me ruined, but not vanquiſhed,
and though, by thy unjuſt aſſiſtance, thou haſt made the blood of</hi>
Anthony <hi>to triumph over that of</hi> Artabazus, <hi>yet is it not to thee,
but to my own revenge and love that I now offer this great
ſacrifice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having uttered theſe words, with a furious action he turned the
point of his ſword againſt his breaſt, and directing it to a certain
place where there was nothing of arms to oppoſe its paſſage, he fell
upon it ſo of a ſudden, that no man had the time to prevent him,
and that ſo effectually, as to his deſign, that the murdering ſword
meeting with no reſiſtance, ran him quite through, and, paſſing
through thoſe parts which are moſt neceſſary for the preſervation
of life, deprived him of it in a moment. Though that unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
King had drawn upon himſelf the deteſtation of all thoſe that
were preſent at his death; yet were there ſome among them, who
could not but pitty his misfortune: and though <hi>Alexander</hi> were a
perſon that of all men had the moſt juſt ground to hate him, yet
was he extreamly troubled for him, even to the ſhedding of tears
at that deplorable adventure. <hi>Artemiſa</hi> ran immediately to her
brother with a face over-flown with tears, and bewailed his loſſe
with all the lamentations, which an exceſſe of good nature could
put into a womans mouth. <hi>Cleopatra, Coriolanus,</hi> and <hi>Marcellus</hi>
thought themſelvs concerned in it meerly out of a conſideration of
generoſity, and not long after, they all jointly acknowledged the
juſtice of the gods in that example, and ſubmitted to their will
in the puniſhment of that cruel King. <hi>Artemiſa</hi> was ſtill about the
body of <hi>Artaxus</hi> with <hi>Megacles</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Armenians,</hi>
who had their lives given them upon the mediation of <hi>Cleopatra.
Cleopatra</hi> returned her thanks to <hi>Marcellus</hi> and Prince <hi>Alexander</hi>
for their aſſiſtance, and <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> not able to ſtand for wearineſſe
by reaſon of the continual action he had undergone for ſo long
time, and the weakneſſe he was in, through certain wounds he
had received, was ſate down, and looked on what paſſed as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:97242:91"/>
diſtracted by different reflections, when <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
caſting their eyes on him, knew him. Their aſtoniſhment was
not ſmall at that accident, for <hi>Alexander,</hi> having been acquainted
by <hi>Marcellus</hi> with the pretended infidelity of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> he was
no leſſe ſurprized then <hi>Marcellus,</hi> to find him with <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> Now
<hi>Alexander,</hi> having ever loved the perſon, and reſpected the vertue
of the Son of <hi>Juba,</hi> thought not the ground he had to hate him
ſo great as ſhould oblige him to forget the eſteem he ſometimes
had had for him. But <hi>Marcellus,</hi> whoſe reſentment proceeded from
a more violent paſſion, could not abſolutely moderate himſelf in
that emergency, and looking accordingly on the Princeſſe <hi>Cleopatra</hi>
with a countenance wherein might be ſeen the lively characters of
his aſtoniſhment: <q>What, Siſter, <hi>ſaid he to her,</hi> is the King of
<hi>Mauritania</hi> among you? And is that Prince, who is guilty of
ſo horrid an infidelity both againſt you and me, ſo neer <hi>Cleopatra,</hi>
whom he had ſo ungratefully forſaken? You may credit your
own eyes, <hi>ſayes</hi> Cleopatra <hi>to him,</hi> and know withall, that that
very inconſtant man, whom you find ſo neer me, hath fought all
this day alone againſt <hi>Artaxus</hi> and all his men, hath killed the
greateſt part of thoſe you ſee laid along upon the deck, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw
<hi>Artaxus</hi> in your preſence at the very inſtant, that he was
going to take away my life, and hath done ſo much in my aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
that without it, yours had come too late, and I had been
yet in the hands and power of the King of <hi>Armenia.</hi> I never
queſtioned, replies <hi>Marcellus,</hi> but that <hi>Coriolanus</hi> was the moſt
valiant Prince upon earth; but we may as little doubt, for your
part and mine, but that of all men he is the moſt unfaithful both
to his Miſtreſſe and his friend.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> as it were, awakened by this diſcourſe, out of thoſe
reflections wherein his thoughts were employed before, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on <hi>Marcellus</hi> with a certain diſcovery of his reſentment;
<q>Marcellus, <hi>ſaid he to him,</hi> now do I perceive that thy cruelty
knows no limits, and thou thinkeſt it nothing to cruſh a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
man with ſuch indignities as he could not have expected
from a Prince that had ſometimes been his friend. It is a great
demonſtration of my fidelity, that I ſuffer theſe affronts from thee
with patience, and not many daies ſince, when thou hadſt an
implacable deſign againſt my life, I preſented my breaſt to the
point of thy ſword without the leaſt oppoſition, though it be
not unknown to thee that I am able to defend it. If it be any
trouble to thee that thou didſt not then take it from me, come
now and deſtroy the pittiful remainders that are left of it, and
ſatiate thy ſelf with my blood without tormenting me continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
with thy cruel perſecution. Acknowledge the difference
there was between us in point of friendſhip, ſince that, for an

a real infidelity, thou art bent againſt my life with ſo much
inhumanity, and that by ſo many unworthy actions of thine,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:97242:92"/>
(whence I cannot but too much infer thy baſeneſſe) thou couldſt
never abate any thing of that affection which my heart hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
for thee, and does ſtill preſerve, indeed, but with too too
much fidelity. Go cruel man, triumph over my misfortune by
thy change, and proſecute, with <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> thoſe enjoyments
which I am content to reſign to thee. I muſt needs at laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
from the conformity which I perceive there is between
her ſentiments and thine, that it is upon thy account, and to enjoy
thee, that ſhe ſlights me, as conceiving her fortune will be much
better with <hi>Caeſars</hi> Nephew, a perſon deſtined for the Empire
of the Univerſe, then with a beggarly diſpoſſeſſed Prince, whom
Fortune hath not left any thing but his ſword. And yet as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
and as wretched as I am, I would not reſign the intereſt
I have in her to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> while I had one drop of bloud left in
my veines, and I would wander all over the World, but I would
find him, and take away his life, did I but once imagine that
<hi>Cleopatra</hi> were deſigned for him. But for thee, who didſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
quit the pretentions thou hadſt to her, to me, I find in my
ſelf a complyance for thee, ſuitable to ſo great an obligation, and
if I cannot look on thy fortune without dying, I will be ſo far
from being any way thy hindrance, that I ſhall haply by my
death remove out of thy way the greateſt obſtacle which
any other but thy ſelf could have met with in ſuch a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This was the diſcourſe of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> and notwithſtanding the
cruel prejudice, whereby ſome, that were concerned in it, were
poſſeſſed, yet had it that influence upon their ſpirits, that it was
impoſſible for them to conceal the diſcoveries of their ſympathy.
<hi>Marcellus,</hi> who was a perſon of an excellent good nature, could
not diſſemble it; and doing himſelf a certain violence to expreſſe
what he felt within him; <q>Coriolanus, <hi>ſaid he to the Prince,</hi> how
far ſoever I ought to be perſwaded of thy infidelity, yet have
I not ſo great an averſion for thee, but that I would ſpend the
beſt part of my bloud, might it contribute any thing to thy
juſtification; and if thy proceeding had been ſuch as to leave us
anything to doubt of, thou hadſt found an advocate in my heart,
that would have maintained thy innocence againſt all the World
to the laſt minute of my life. But, <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> thou wert not
pleaſed to afford us that comfort, and haſt taken ſuch a courſe
to have thy crime noiſed through the whole Roman Empire,
that unleſſe we had been without the limits of it, baniſhed into
the moſt remote parts of the earth, it was impoſſible we ſhould
be ignorant thereof. Aſk the moſt inconſiderable perſon among
the Romans what the infidelity of <hi>Coriolanus</hi> was, and by what
means it broke forth; and then aſk <hi>Caeſar,</hi> aſk all the <hi>Romans,</hi>
nay, <hi>Cleopatra</hi> her ſelf, whether I have betrayed thee, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
from the day that for thy ſake I diſengaged my ſelf from
the affection I had for her, I ever looked on her otherwiſe then
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:97242:92"/>
as a Siſter, or minded any mans intereſts as to her, but thine. Do
not therefore charge either her or me with any baſeneſſe, ſince
there hath happened no change in our ſentiments, and that when
we both accuſe thee with a departure from thy former thoughts,
and the infidelity thou haſt committed againſt us, infer not that
I have quitted <hi>Julia</hi> for <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> or that <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> ſhunning
<hi>Coriolanus</hi> as a monſter of ingratitude, hath looked on the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,

Subjects, was the chief perſon of that Embaſſy, and he came
along with <hi>Voluſius</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> at his return out of <hi>Mauritania.</hi>
There was nothing omitted in that affair, either as to ſolemnity
or form, and if it wrought not the effect you expected it ſhould,
it hath raiſed in the heart of your friend, and that very juſtly,
the reſentment he hath diſcovered to you, and in that of the

<hi>Camilla,</hi> whom the vertue of that Prince had ever obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to ſide with him, perceiving he was mute and immoveable

then if he had been ſtruck with a thunder-bolt, ſtood ſtill for a
good ſpace of time looking ſtill about him as if it had been to
ſeek for ſome either to witneſſe his innocence, or make good the
charge put in againſt him. At laſt, diſpelling his aſtoniſhment, and
fearing his ſilence might be thought an argument of his guilt, he
comes nearer to <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and ſetting one knee to the ground;
<q>Madam, <hi>ſaid he to her,</hi> I humbly crave your pardon, for my
having charged you with any thing unjuſtly; I ſhould have
known, that you are juſt in all things, and thence have infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that your change could not proceed but from a cauſe ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thereto. I might haply, not without reaſon, hope it from
your goodneſſe and the friendſhip of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> that you would
have proved my advocate to your ſelf, and plead my cauſe againſt
the artifices and deſignes of my enemies. And this it was not
hard for you to take notice of, ſince there was little likelyhood
I ſhould ſo much court the allyance and friendſhip of <hi>Caeſar</hi>
when I was poſſeſſed of the throne of my Anceſtors, having
ſlighted it in a time when I had no favour or fortune to hope
for but from him alone, or that I ſhould voluntarily offer him
the homage of my kingdomes after I had conquered them by
open war, and the defeat of his forces, when I had not long
before refuſed them of him upon thoſe very termes. But, in
fine, ſince I have not been ſo fortunate as to find that protection
in you, and that you have really been perſwaded that I had been
guilty of a baſeneſſe ſo improbable as that, and, if I may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to ſay it, ſo diſconſonant to the other actions of my life,
it concernes me to endeavour my own juſtification, and to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
both you, and all the world beſides, of the impoſſibility
there is I ſhould be guilty of ſo baſe an infidelity. I muſt find
out <hi>Voluſius</hi> and <hi>Theocles,</hi> and I muſt find out <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who, no
doubt, is the Authour of this cruell intrigue. I hope, through
the aſſiſtance of the gods, to make my innocence apparent to
all, and am confident that within a ſhort time I ſhall diſpell all
theſe miſts of plots and prejudice. But, Madam, you may be
pleaſed to remember, that when you baniſhed me out of your
ſight for ever, and pronounced that dreadfull ſentence, which
hath occaſioned all my loſſes, I was maſter of two great King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
which I came to preſent you with, and that through the
deſpair you put me into, you deprived me not onely of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
but even of the deſigne I had to go and maintain them, as
no doubt I could have done againſt all the forces of the
Univerſe. Through that misfortune is it now come to paſſe
that I have nothing left me, as having loſt, not onely the crowns
I had conquered, but alſo the Friendſhip of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> from whom
I was to hope for all I could expect. So that when I ſhall return
again into your ſight, in a condition innocent enough to hope a
readmiſſion into your favour, I ſhall have no Crowne to offer you
nor indeed a refuge in any part of the earth, it being not ſo
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:97242:93"/>
eaſie for me to expect a ſecond revolt of my Subjects, after I
have by my negligence betraied them to <hi>Caeſars</hi> ſeverity, and the
orders he hath ſetled in the Provinces ſince his laſt conqueſt
thereof. Thus Madam, can I not caſt my eies on you with any
confidence, nor indeed deſire, you ſhould faſten your felfe to
the fortunes of a miſerable perſon that hath not an inch of earth
to offer you and to entertain you in. However I go my waies
in order to my juſtification, ſo to ſatisfie both my love and my
duty, by both which I am equally obliged thereto: and when
I ſhall have effected it, I ſhall either, out of a complyance with
the will of the gods, not diſturb a better fortune, which it is in
their power to ſend you, or, with my hopes, loſe a life
which muſt needs be troubleſome to you, and to me inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this effect was the diſcourſe of <hi>Juba's</hi> ſon, and <hi>Cleopatra</hi>
and <hi>Marcellus</hi> were ſo moved thereat, as alſo at the reflection he
cauſed them to make upon the deplorable change of his condition,
that they could not forbear teares, and all other demonſtrations
of the tenderneſſe, compaſſion, and ſympathy, which might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
upon ſuch an occaſion. <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> the moſt concerned of
any to expreſſe her ſentiments to the Prince, looking on him with
eies wherein could not be ſeen any thing of diſpleaſure; <q>Go
Coriolanus, <hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> go, and endeavour your juſtification,
I deſire you ſhould effect it, no leſſe than you do your ſelfe.
'Tis poſſible you might be ſufficiently juſtified in my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
by the things you have done for my deliverance, by the
probability which I find in your diſcourſe, and by the good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
I have of you, were it not requiſite to make your innocence
apparent, that ſo it might be lawfull for <hi>Cleopatra</hi> to readmit
you, with honour, into her former favour and affection. They
are but the juſt rewards of your fidelity, if you have continued
in it, and the loſſe of your Kingdomes ſhall looſe you nothing in
my heart if yours have ſuffered no change. In the mean tune
conceale your ſelfe in a Country where you are to feare all
things, as being ſo near ſo powerfull an enemy; and aſſure your
ſelfe that in the uncertainty I may be in of your fidelity, I am
not ſo little concerned in the ſafety of your life, but that I
tremble when I reflect on the hazards whereto you expoſe
it.</q>

                     <p>With theſe words ſhe reached forth her hand to raiſe him up,
and the Prince imagined to himſelf ſo much kindneſſe and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

knowing how to expreſſe his reſentments, when <hi>Marcellus,</hi> looking

                     <p>Having ſaid thus much, they all went towards <hi>Artemiſa</hi> who
was ſhowring down her teares upon the body of her Brother, and,
after they had given her a little time to recover her ſelfe, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
her to paſſe into the other veſſel. <hi>Artemiſa</hi> was content,
and was handed in by her <hi>Alexander,</hi> who, looking on her now as
Queen of <hi>Armenia,</hi> by reaſon of the generall opinion there was
of the death of <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> would have behaved himſelf with
more reſpect towards her than he had done before, would ſhe
have permitted it. They ordered <hi>Megacles</hi> to carry the body of
<hi>Artaxus</hi> to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that it might be embalmed, and tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thence into the monument of his Fathers: and <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> who
had a great eſteem for <hi>Megacles,</hi> out of a conſideration of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
would needs be carried aſhore in his ſhip. <hi>Cleopatra, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus,
Alexander</hi> and <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> having once more taken their
leaves of him, went into their own, and, with all the joy and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
which they could derive from the liberty of the two
Princeſſes, ſet ſaile towards <hi>Alexandria.</hi>

in <hi>Alexandria. Agrippa,</hi> under whoſe protection they had

of vertue and generoſity forbears the diſcoveries of his

(generally known by the name of <hi>Cleomedon</hi>) comes to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi>
upon intelligence that Queen <hi>Candace</hi> was there,
with whom he hath a ſecret interview in the night time. He
entertains her and <hi>Eliſa</hi> with a continuation of his Hiſtory.
He gives battle, with 16000 men, to <hi>Tiribaſus,</hi> who had 100000.
is left for dead in the field, but afterwards miraculouſly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by <hi>Eteocles,</hi> who was left in a condition not much better.
The next day after the battel, <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> an <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Lady,
coming into the Field to ſeek the body of her beloved <hi>Tera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi>
is brought alſo to that of <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> whom, as having
killed him, and not long before a Brother of hers, ſhe would
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:97242:96"/>
have run through with a dagger, but is prevented by <hi>Eteocles.</hi>
Making a ſecond attempt to do it, ſhe finds ſomething in his
countenance, which being taken with, ſhe hath compaſſion on
him, cauſing him and <hi>Eteocles</hi> to be carryed to her Caſtle, where
they were nobly entertained, and recovered of their wounds.
<hi>Eurinoe,</hi> having given order for the enterrement of her dear
<hi>Teramenes,</hi> he miraculouſly recovers to life, and is brought by
<hi>Pelorus</hi> to a ſiſters houſe of his, where he is ſecretly cured, and
informed of all that paſſes at <hi>Eurinoe's.</hi> She falls in love
with <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> whom ſhe much preſſes to promiſe her a mutual
affection: but he perſiſting in his former reſolutions of vertue,
and conſtancy towards <hi>Candace,</hi> all proves ineffectual. Several
conferences they had together to that purpoſe, moſt of which are
over-heard by <hi>Teramenes,</hi> who thereupon conceives a great
eſteem for <hi>Cleomedon.</hi> At laſt <hi>Teramenes</hi> is reconciled to <hi>Eurinoe,</hi>
and by the mediation of <hi>Cleomedon</hi> they are married before
his departure thence; and, in requital of his good offices,

IN the mean time, the Queen of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
of the <hi>Parthians</hi> were gotten into <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and
after that the two Princeſſes had been diſpoſed into their
ſeveral lodgings, <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who had already taken order
for the entertainment of the King of the <hi>Medes,</hi> did the
like for the accommodation of <hi>Artaban.</hi> This latter,
though he were not looked upon as a perſon of a royal rank,
as <hi>Tygranes</hi> was, yet was he treated with as much reſpect as any of
thoſe that wore Diadems; and the great reputation he had acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
ſuch as was already ſpread over the whole earth, added to the
gracefulneſſe of his countenance, and that majeſtick aire which
was ſo remarkable in his perſon, made <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and the Praetor of
<hi>Egypt</hi> conſider him as a man worthy all the reverence and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
that might be due even to the <hi>Caeſars.</hi> Though by an
extraordinary indulgence of good fortune he had come off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
wounds, having been engaged in ſo great a fight as he was that
day, yet was he not ſo throughly recovered of thoſe he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
before, but that the action he had been in had weakned him
ſo much, as that he ſtood in need of ſome reſt. <hi>Eliſa</hi> could have
wiſhed he ſhould take his eaſe for a certain number of daies; but,
not able to perſwade him to it, by reaſon of the impoſſibility which
he urged there was he ſhould forbear waiting on her for ſo long
time, after he had ſo miraculouſly met with her again, ſhe laid her
commauds on him not to ſtir out of his bed for that night, and
the beſt part of the next day, though ſhe did no ſmall violencce
to her ſelf meerly out of the tenderneſſe ſhe had for his health.
He obeyed her commands with that reſpectful ſubmiſſion, which,
notwithſtanding his heat and fierceneſſe, he had ever obſerved
towards her, and, receiving the lodgings appointed him, and the
Officers whom <hi>Cornelius</hi> ordered to waite on him, with abundance
of ſatisfaction and reſpects, he paſſed over that night in his bed
with reflections much different from thoſe which he had had, for
ſome that preceded it. Certain it is, that that great ſoul, great
even among thoſe that could pretend moſt to greatneſſe, though
it were not immoderately ſubject either to grief or joy, was at
this time ſenſible of both: for as it had, in the loſſe of <hi>Eliſa,</hi> made
tryal of the greateſt ſpight that a malicious fortune could do him;
ſo in the happy recovery of her, he had met with the ſweeteſt
ſatisfaction he could be capable of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="188" facs="tcp:97242:97"/>
During theſe pleaſant entertainments of his thoughts, reflecting
on the many extraordinary accidents that checquered his life, and
not a little delighted with the conſideration of thoſe many victories
that had raiſed his fame to ſo a high pitch, and the noble demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations
of his affection to his Princeſſe, he could hardly for ſome
time ſo much as think of the misfortunes he had already run
through, or the oppoſition he might for the future meet withall,
through either the cruelty of <hi>Phraates,</hi> or the troubleſome enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
between him and the King of the <hi>Medes.</hi> All this ſignified
very little with him, when it came into his mind that he had found
<hi>Eliſa</hi> again, that, by many diſcoveries, he found her not diſpleaſed
that ſhe had met him, that he was within the ſame walls with her,
and that in a place, where ſhe ſtood not in fear of any thing from
either the authority or tyranny of <hi>Phraates.</hi> 
                        <q>O ye immortal gods,
<hi>ſaid he at laſt, directing his thoughts to Heaven with all poſſible
acknowledgment,</hi> O yee aſſiſtant deities, who have ever deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me out of thoſe abyſſes of misfortunes, whereinto an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placably
malicious Fortune, and the ingratitude of men have
often forced me! I humbly acknowledge your power in this
miraculous effect of your goodneſſe, and I repine no longer for
what I have ſuffered, either from the hands of ungrateful men,
or from the contrary diſpoſal of my deſtiny, ſince you have been
pleaſed at length to reſtore me my <hi>Eliſa.</hi> I have not forgotten
how much I am obliged to celebrate your divine aſſiſtances, not
onely for a many victories which have proved the means to raiſe
me to ſome name and rank in the World, but alſo for the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
protection which you thought fit to afford me, as well
amidſt the ſwords of my enemies, as the angry waves. There is
therefore much leſſe reaſon I ſhould forget, that, at the point of
deſpair, you reſtore my Princeſſe, and with her thoſe felicities
which are not ſubject either to the inconſtancy of Fortune or the
ingratitude of men</q>.</p>
                     <p>From this conſideration his thoughts were taken up with
<hi>Tigranes,</hi> and he began to reflect on the obſtacles and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
he might fear from him, and his unfortunate meeting with
him; and certainly, ſuch a reflection, had it happened at ſome
other time might have moderated, if not diſturbed, his joy, but,
as things ſtood now, it was not ſo conſiderable as to come into
ballance againſt his preſent happineſſe. Whereupon, calling to
mind how that during the ſmall time he had been felicified with
the company of his <hi>Eliſa,</hi> he had obſerved that her affections were
abſolutely devoted to him, and that ſhe had all averſion that could
be for <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>igranes,</hi> he could not but raiſe his thoughts to a certain
confidence, that all the hindrance he might fear from that Rival
would not be able to injure his Fortune. The protection which
<hi>Agrippa</hi> had put him in hopes of amounted to ſo much, as to win
him into a belief, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> would not any way oppoſe him, and
the conſtancy he had perceived in <hi>Eliſa</hi> towards him, though ſhe
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:97242:97"/>
were not naturally guilty of too much forwardneſſe, made him
imagine that though all the world ſhould be againſt him, yet was
his happineſſe ſo ſurely grounded on the affection of his Princeſſe,
that nothing could ſhake it. Amidſt theſe imaginations wherein
it might be ſaid he placed a certain felicity, his greateſt diſquiet,
was, that he wanted the ſight and preſence of his <hi>Eliſa</hi> for ſome
few houres; and the impatience he was in to ſee her again,
made him look on that one night, and a peice of the next
day as if it had been a year, ſo triviall ſeemed to him
the conſideration of his reſt in compariſon of that of his
Love.</p>
                     <p>But if his reflections troubled and interrupted his ſleep, that of
the great <hi>Agrippa</hi> might be ſaid to be ſubject to greater diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For the paſſion he had for <hi>Eliſa</hi> having already arrived to
its full ſtrength, and being come to ſuch a height as that all the
force of his underſtanding and diſcourſe was not able to oppoſe
it, the effects it had wrought in his ſoule were accordingly ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
that he could expect no other iſſue thereof but perpetuall
and inevitable diſquiet. And though it had been meerly out of
the conſideration of his own vertue, which would not ſuffer him
to deny the doing of a good action, when an opportunity offered
it ſelf to do it, that he had protected <hi>Artaban,</hi> againſt the armes
and power of <hi>Tygranes,</hi> and purely out of generoſity had taken
his part rather than that of the King of the <hi>Medes,</hi> yet was it not
in his power to forbear looking on him as his Rivall, and that not
as a Rivall out of favour and ſlighted, as <hi>Tygranes</hi> was, but as one
much eſteemed by <hi>Eliſa,</hi> and conſequently as the only perſon that
had been ſo fortunate as to engage her affections. He had, it
ſeems, that very day obſerved very evident demonſtrations of the
mutuall reſpects that paſſed between them. And whereas, on the
other ſide, the revolutions which had happened in the Kingdome
of the Parthians and that of the Medes by the valour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of <hi>Artaban</hi> were of ſuch conſequence as that they were
knowne all over the world; in like manner, his inclinations for
<hi>Eliſa,</hi> and the ingratitude of <hi>Phraates,</hi> made no ſmall noiſe among
the Romanes and by that meanes was come to the eares of <hi>Agrippa</hi>
ſo that when he looked on <hi>Artaban</hi> he muſt needs conſider him
as that perſon, who of all men was the moſt likely and moſt able to
croſſe him in his love, or rather as the only man that could ruine all
his pretences.</p>
                     <p>This conſideration made him ſigh for very griefe, and if his
vertue had not been ſo great, no queſtion but he had repented
him of the aſſiſtance he had given him: but, having withall a great
and gallant ſoule, and all his reſentments conformable to the noble
fame he had acquired, he could not be troubled that he had done
what he ought to have done, and thought it ſufficient onely to
quarrell at the croſſeneſſe of his Fortune without being guilty of
a wiſh that ſhould any way derogate from his vertue. Nay, he
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:97242:98"/>
was not able to conceive any averſion for ſuch a Rivall, and thoſe
excellent qualities which might oblige him to fear <hi>Artaban,</hi> were
no leſſe powerfull in obliging him to love him, as repreſenting to
him, that he might by the ſame means deſerve the friendſhip of
<hi>Agrippa,</hi> as he had obtained the love of <hi>Eliſa.</hi> And yet all this
hindered not but that he wiſhed himſelf loved by <hi>Eliſa,</hi> and all
the great vertue he was maſter of, could not oppoſe in him a
deſire ſo naturall to thoſe that Love, nor prevaile with him to
quit <hi>Eliſa</hi> to <hi>Artaban,</hi> though he were very much in her favour,
and not unworthy her affections. He was ſatisfied that how ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
ſoever he might be to gain her love, all his endeavours
would prove ineffectuall, and yet his paſſion exaſperated by
that kind of deſpair ſeemed to grow more and more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull,
and to ſeate it ſelf in his ſoule with more empire and
authority.</p>
                     <p>From this therefore he concluded; that it was impoſſible for
him to give over loving <hi>Eliſa,</hi> and thereupon reſolved to do all
that lay in his power to force her inclinations from <hi>Artaban<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> and
to give a check to the favour ſhe was pleaſed to afford him. But,
in regard that all his thoughts were comformable to honour and
generoſity, and out of a conſideration that he could not, without
prejudice to both, diſturb a noble affection grounded on extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Services, and that, between perſons that had caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
under his protection, in a place where he had all power in
his own hands, and where, in all likelihood, he could not make uſe
of his authority, without a certain kind of tyranny, he
ſought but a meane to reconcile his <hi>Love</hi> to his <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi>
and to manage the former without prejudice to the
latter.</p>
                     <p>Upon theſe reflections he reſolved to diſpute the buſineſſe
fairly with <hi>Artaban,</hi> without any advantage as to matter of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and to ſtrive with him for the heart of <hi>Eliſa,</hi> by deſert and
ſervices, and not make uſe of his credit in the Empire, or the
authority of <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Being confirmed daily more and more in that
reſolution; <q>What injury, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> do I do <hi>Artaban,</hi> by being
deſirous to engage with him in a combat; wherein all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
is of his ſide? And what quarrell can be juſtly have
againſt me when I ſhall with no other force, than that of Love,
aſſault a heart already delivered up to his diſpoſall, and that a
heart favourably prepoſſeſſed for him with all that may make
him happy, to my prejudice. I am not engaged to him either
upon any account of Friendſhip, or obligation, and therefore
ſee no reaſon that ſhould perſwade me tamely to ſit down in
my own miſery, out of a fear of thwarting his happineſſe.
There are few perſons haply that have ſuch a command of their
inclinations, as to confine themſelves to thoſe rules which I
propoſe to my ſelfe, and it is in Love rather than policy, and to
gain the poſſeſſion of what a man moſt affects, rather than to
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:97242:98"/>
gain a kingdome, that it is lawfull to employ all armes, and to
make uſe of all manner of forces. And yet to avoid the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
I might make to my ſelfe, of having abuſed my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
againſt perſons to whom it is contrary, I will by no means
make uſe of <hi>Auguſtus's</hi> favour, or the power I have in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
but ſhall be content to be unhappy while I live, if
my happineſſe cannot be effected by other waies than
thoſe.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having ſo ſaid, he recollected himſelfe for ſome few minutes,
as if he were extreamly well ſatisfied with the reſolution he had
taken. But not long after, reflecting on the difficulty of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe,
and the little hope he had to bring it to any effect:
<q>It is true, <hi>continued he,</hi> that by this courſe I ſhould avoid that
remorſe and thoſe ſcruples which might riſe in my mind, for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing,
by my power, a man whoſe vertue is not inferiour to
my own: but, alas! if this be the way to quiet my conſcience,
it is alſo the onely courſe I can take to cruſh my hopes; that is,
I undertake a buſineſſe whereof I cannot expect the ſucceſſe
ſhould be fortunate. <hi>Artaban</hi> is already very much in the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of <hi>Eliſa,</hi> and beſides the eminent ſervices, whereby he
hath deſerved her favour, he is otherwiſe worthy of it upon
the account of the great excellencies of his perſon, as much
as for the noble effects of his Love. So that there is very little
probability, that a Soule engaged not onely by a great merit
and very conſiderable ſervices, but alſo haply by a ſtrong incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
can eaſily be diſengaged by a new affection, if I neglect
my advantages, (which alone may come into compariſon
with thoſe of my Rivall) and meerly upon the account of
merit deale with a merit, which is ſo far from being inferiour
to my own, that it hath already wrought in the ſoule of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi>
all that I could hope, or rather all that I could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This reflection troubled, and caſt him down very much; but
not long after taking encouragement from that little ſhadow of
hope which ever offers it ſelfe even to the moſt miſerable;
<q>Why, <hi>added he,</hi> may it not be lawfull for me to hope? There
happen daily revolutions no leſſe ſtrange than what I am about
to undertake, and if a man may be pardoned a little ſelfe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
upon ſome certain occaſions, I may hope ſomething beyond
the ordinary rate of men. My perſon is not unacceptable to
thoſe that ſee me, I have ſome name among men, my ranke is
conſiderable enough to work ſome effect on the inclinations of
<hi>Eliſa,</hi> to the prejudice of a man, to whom heaven, though it
hath beſtowed on him great advantages, hath denied ſome
part of thoſe which it was but requiſite he ſhould have to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the Princeſſe of the <hi>Parthians.</hi> Let us hope then if we
may preſume to do it, or at leaſt, let us not abſolutely deſpair,
ſince that hope is a vertue ſo much inclined to aſſiſt any one, that
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:97242:99"/>
it hardly forſakes the moſt unfortunate that are, though in their
greateſt and laſt extremities.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus were <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Artaban</hi> treated by love, (who at this
time, in a City where the <hi>Ptolomeys</hi> had reigned, was taken up with
nobler employments then haply he had met with in all the extent
of his Empire) while Prince <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> and Prince <hi>Philadelph,</hi>
were entertained by him with ſuch enjoyments as to all others
were incomprehenſible. Theſe two Lovers, who, after ſo many
traverſes of fortune, and ſo many tempeſts, ſaw themſelves at the
feet of their amiable Princeſſes, as it were in a ſecure Haven, could
not without ſome difficulty apprehend the greatneſſe of their feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
when they reflected on their paſt miſeries, and may
in ſome ſort be ſaid to have found that, in the exceſſe of
their joy, which they had avoided in their afflictions and dangers.
All that day was ſpent in tranſports, ſuch as the prudence of their
Princeſſes would have moderated, though ineffectually; and
though thoſe of <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> ſhould, proportionably to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures,
and the accidents had happened to him, (which indeed
had been of the moſt dangerous and extraordinary) have expreſſed
in all probability ſomething more vehement then could be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from thoſe of <hi>Philadelph;</hi> yet was it certain, that in the
ſoul of the Prince of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> there paſſed ſomewhat that argued
a greater tenderneſſe and ſenſibility of affection. For, this ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
having happened equally to both that they had met with
the Princeſſes they adored, and whom they ſought out ſo earneſtly,
<hi>Philadelph</hi> had this advantage, that now he had by many infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
demonſtrations diſcovered himſelf to be admitted to a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
which he was not before aſſured of, and found that his amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Delia,</hi> who, while they were in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> could never be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
to declare what ſentiments ſhe had for him, made no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to afford him, even in the preſence, and with the conſent, of
her Brother, the greateſt proofs of affection he could have deſired,
from a vertue, ſuch as was that of <hi>Delia.</hi> Above a hundred times
that day had he embraced her knees, with expreſſions of love
particular to his paſſion; and the modeſt <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> mildly putting
him back, could not but with joy obſerve the continuation of that
noble affection, whereof he had given her ſo many obliging de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations
in <hi>Cilicia.</hi> The more he called to mind thoſe pleaſant
entertainments, the more it added to his acknowledgments, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch,
that the fair <hi>Olympia,</hi> whom <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> had already
acquainted with all the particulars of their Hiſtory, conceiving
an affection towards <hi>Philadelph,</hi> upon the account had been given
her of his generous way of proceeding, took occaſion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
<hi>Arſinoe</hi> more and more in the reſentments ſhe had
thereof.</p>
                     <p>Yet was not this felicity of <hi>Philadelph</hi> without ſome diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
for the experience he had of the King of <hi>Armenia</hi>'s diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
(which was ſuch as admitted no reconciliation with his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies)
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:97242:99"/>
put him, not without ſome ground, into a fear he might
refuſe his allyance, and, out of the hatred he had him for his
houſe, raiſe him ſome new difficulties. <hi>Arſinoe</hi> her ſelf was not
abſolutely free from that fear, and could not diſſemble it to <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delph,</hi>
when he diſcovered his to her: but <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> gave him
the beſt conſolations and aſſurances he could, by promiſing him
that he would further his intereſts as much as lay in his power,
even though the King his Brother ſhould oppoſe them, and that
he would periſh rather then that <hi>Arſinoe</hi> ſhould be any other mans
then <hi>Philadelph.</hi> Beſides, when it came to the worſt, they had this
courſe to gain the conſent of <hi>Artaxus,</hi> ſtill left them, which was
to make uſe of the authority of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> who had ſuch an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upon the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> that he could not deny him any
thing, having ſome intentions, to that very end, to caſt themſelves
under the protection of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> who had ſometimes proffered it
them, and making no doubt but that he would employ the utmoſt
of his intereſt to effect their quiet, not onely upon their own
intreaty, but alſo upon the recommendation of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who had
promiſed to aſſiſt them with all the power he had with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
The ſame mediation they thought would prove effectual
with the King of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> who in all probability would gladly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with the deſires of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> though, on that ſide, all that was to
be done was to ſatisfie <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> in regard <hi>Philadelph</hi> was fully
reſolved not to be troubled at any obſtacles, which through the
means of the King his Father, might any way delay his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> his trouble was much leſſe, as being not
obliged, as <hi>Arſinoe</hi> was, to be guided by the will of his Brother,
and knowing no reaſon he could alledge to diſapprove the allyance
of <hi>Olympia.</hi> However, he hoped he ſhould not want <hi>Caeſars</hi>
Authority, if it were requiſite, and doubted not but he ſhould find
him favourable in an occaſion which of its ſelf was ſufficiently
ſuch. The conſent of <hi>Adallas</hi> he ſtood not at all upon, as thinking
it unneceſſary, and, beſides that he had already given it, he had,
by the inconſtancy of his proceedings, given them but too clear a
diſpenſation from all ordinary proceedings. The greateſt regret he
now had, was, that he wanted a Crown to preſent <hi>Olympia</hi> withall,
as <hi>Adallas</hi> had ſometimes caſt it in his diſh. For though that
Princeſſe ſeemed to be very well ſatisfied with his preſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to prefer his perſon before all the Empires of the World,
yet had it been no ſmall difficulty to him to digeſt the diſpleaſure
he conceived thereat, had there not been a certain hope left, that
with the help of the ſame ſword which had defended <hi>Thrace</hi> with
ſo much valour, he might poſſibly raiſe <hi>Olympia</hi> to the dignity of
her Anceſtors. Beſides, it muſt needs be ſome grief to him, to
obſerve, in the Princeſſes countenance, the alteration, which her
ſickneſſe and ſufferings had wrought therein; but he doubted not
but that in an age, ſuch as was that of <hi>Olympia,</hi> joy might recover
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:97242:100"/>
what ſadneſſe had taken away, nay, he was further of opinion,
that the change which her condition had received that very day,
had in that ſmall ſpace of time retrived no ſmall part of her
beauty.</p>
                     <p>Theſe four, mutually loving, and mutually beloved perſons,
having thus paſſed the day together, underſtood at night, and not
long after the return of <hi>Eliſa</hi> and <hi>Candace,</hi> ſome part of what had
happened to them, and how that the Princeſſe of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> had
almoſt been carryed away: but what they heard was with ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
and confuſion. And therefore ſince it was very late, &amp; that
they were aſſured the Princeſſes were ſafely arrived in the palace
they forbore the viſit they intended them till the next day, as
being only to expreſſe how much they concerned themſelves in
their adventure, and their deſires to be acquainted with the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
thereof.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>Candace,</hi> and the fair <hi>Eliſa</hi> being retired to
the lodgings appointed them, after they had endured the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Cornelius</hi> for the ſpace of an houre, were
no ſooner left alone with the women that attended them, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
themſelves delivered of the company that had hindred
them from entertaining one another when they had the greateſt
deſire and opportunity to do it, they cauſed their chamber door
to be made faſt, that they might diſcourſe with greater privacy
and liberty. After they had looked upon one the other, with
eyes wherein might be perceived ſome part of what they had to
ſay, they embraced one another with as much earneſtneſſe, as if
it had been a long time ſince they had met. Whereupon, ſitting
down together upon a bed, <hi>Candace</hi> began firſt to ſpeak, and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Eliſa's</hi> hand between her own, with an action expreſſing the
greatneſſe of her friendſhip; <q>Well then, my deareſt Princeſſe,
<hi>ſaid ſhe to her,</hi> will you not for the future give credit to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
and was I not a true propheteſſe, when I promiſed you
a happy change in your fortune? Faireſt Queen, <hi>replyed Eliſa,
returning her careſſes,</hi> I ſhould but poorly acknowledge the
happineſſe it was to me to meet with you, ſhould I not have deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from it all the advantages I could expect, for I have not
onely found what I gave over for loſt, according to your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
but I have found it by your means, and through that
inſpiration which no doubt you had from Heaven, to take me
along with you to that happy walk. So that it ſeems then, <hi>replies
Candace,</hi> I am not like to be henceforth the moſt ſatisfied of us
two, and that you will return me ſome part of thoſe conſolations
which you have received from me, when I ſhall bewayle <hi>Caeſario,</hi>
as you did <hi>Artaban.</hi> May it not pleaſe the gods, <hi>replyed Eliſa,</hi> that
you have the ſame occaſion to do it; I had with theſe eies ſeen
<hi>Artaban</hi> buried in the waves, and you have ſeen <hi>Caeſario</hi> living
within theſe few dayes, and know that he is not far from <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria.</hi>
I know not certainly, <hi>replies Candace with a ſigh,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:97242:100"/>
I may truſt my own eies or no, and through the experience
I have of my own unhappineſſe, I begin to imagine that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
a pure illuſion. But whatever it may have been, I am
content for this day to ſuſpend the remembrance of all my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes,
to diſpoſe my ſelf the more abſolutely to joy out of a
complyance with your good fortune, wherein I think my ſelf ſo
much concerned, that I can hardly believe your apprehenſions
of it more lively than mine. This argues you as excellent in
point of goodneſſe, <hi>replyed Eliſa,</hi> as you are in all thoſe great
perfections which make you ſo admirable a perſon, and theſe I
am ſo extreamly ſenſible of, that ...</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>No more of that, I beſeech you, <hi>ſaies Candace, interrupting
her,</hi> I do not expect any acknowledgments, from you, of an
affection, which, being but too much your due, the expreſſions
I make you thereof cannot be exceſſive, nay I queſtion not but
your merit will force as much from all the World beſides. But
ſince it is lawful for me to rejoice with you, now that all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of your weeping is taken away; do you not expect I ſhould
reproach you with a felony you are guilty of towards me, for
having ſtollen from me a man, whoſe firſt inclinations, if I am
not much miſtaken, were directed to me? And conſequently you
will give me leave to charge you with the trick you put upon me,
in that, when you related to me the great actions of <hi>Artaban,</hi>
you would not let me know that it was <hi>Britomarus,</hi> and that, when
I gave you an account of the firſt actions of <hi>Britomarus,</hi> you
would not tell me it was your <hi>Artaban.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>You charge me with two things, <hi>replyed the Princeſſe,</hi> whereof
I ſhall find it no great difficulty to clear my ſelf. For the former,
which is, that I have robbed you of the heart of <hi>Artaban,</hi> I am
to tell you, that the age and condition he was of when he was
with you, conſidered, there is little probability he ſhould lift up
his eies ſo high as you; and that further, ſuppoſing that might
happen, the treatment he received from you, <hi>continued ſhe ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi>
might haply diſplace you out of his heart, ſo that there
might not poſſibly be any neceſſity he ſhould meet with <hi>Eliſa</hi>
the more to alienate his inclinations from you. And for the latter,
which is, that I had not diſcovered to you that <hi>Artaban</hi> was the
ſame perſon with <hi>Britomarus,</hi> I can aſſure you, that I have ever
been ignorant of it as well as your ſelf; that <hi>Artaban</hi> never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
me with any thing that had happened unto him before
I knew him, and that, being ſatisfied that his greateſt glory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
in the memorable actions he had done, whereof thoſe of
moſt conſequence we had the knowledge of, I was never guilty
of a curioſity to know any more of his fortune then he was
pleaſed of himſelf to communicate to me, out of a fear of
engaging him in a diſcourſe, which he ſhould take no great
delight in.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="196" facs="tcp:97242:101"/>
                        <q>I am very much troubled, <hi>added the Queen of Aethiopia,</hi> that
I have acquainted you with that particularity of the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of his life, though it diſcover as much of the greatneſſe of
his courage, as the gallant actions he hath done ſince, and could
I have thought that <hi>Britomarus</hi> was ſometime to be <hi>Artaban,</hi> I
ſhould not have let you known how he had lived with me, in a
condition not proportionable to the rank which he now deſerves
to be in among men. Aſſure your your ſelf, <hi>replyed Eliſa coldly,</hi>
that you have not done him any ill office by that diſcourſe, and
that <hi>Artaban,</hi> having onely told us that he was of noble birth,
hath not been with you in any employment, which might dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
ought from the nobility of his blood. On the other ſide,
<hi>added ſhe, with an action more free and cheerful,</hi> I ſhall not bluſh
when I tell you, that you put me into no ſmall joy, when you
let me know that <hi>Britomarus</hi> had had ſome inclinations for
you; and, if I ſhould think it any miſfortune or malice of my
deſtiny to have complyed with the affection of a man, whoſe
birth is diſproportionable to my own, I ſhould have this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
withal, that I were not the firſt of my rank and quality to
whom he had addreſſed himſelf, and thence fall into this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
that he might very well lift up his eyes to me, when he
had had the confidence to do it, you.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>This were but a very ſlight comfort, <hi>replyed the Queen,</hi> but
indeed you ſtand not in any need of it, ſince the vertue of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taban</hi>
is ſuch as may both raiſe him to Crowns, and without
doubt is to be preferred before them. But, my faireſt Princeſſe,
<hi>continued ſhe preſently after,</hi> will you promiſe me that he ſhall
be no longer at any diſtance with <hi>Caeſario,</hi> if I may be ſo ſo happy
as to meet with him again? He hath made you that promiſe
himſelf, <hi>ſaid the Princeſſe to her,</hi> and, not to mention the reſpect
he hath for you, and the conſideration he may have of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
I made to him to that purpoſe, there is ſo much advantage
in the friendſhip of <hi>Caeſario,</hi> as that he will not onely deſire it,
but endeavour by all wayes to purchace it; nay I dare further
promiſe you upon the experience I have of the generoſity of
<hi>Artaban,</hi> that, if ever any occaſion offer it ſelf, he ſhall with the
hazard of his life confirm the truth of what he hath already
aſſured you of.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eliſa</hi> having ſpoken to this effect, <hi>Candace</hi> ſpent a few minutes
as it were in a deep recollection, not making her any anſwer at
all. At laſt, awaking as it were out of it, and lifting up her head,
ſhe ſpoke to the Princeſſe with much more earneſtneſſe then ſhe
had done before. <q>But, Madam, <hi>ſaid ſhe to her,</hi> if I am not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken,
you related a while ſince, before <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Cornelius,</hi>
how that when <hi>Tigranes</hi> would have carried you away, you had
been relieved by a certain man that laid him groveling on the
ground, and killed two of his men.</q> 
                        <q>Tis very right, Madam,
<hi>replyed the Prenceſſe,</hi> I have been relieved by a very miraculous
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:97242:101"/>
perſon: one that muſt certainly be <hi>Caeſario,</hi> ſince it was not
<hi>Artaban.</hi> The diſtraction and trouble I was in hindred me
from taking better notice of him, onely thus much I can
remember of him, that he was ſomewhat pale in the face by
reaſon of ſome wound or ſickneſſe; that he ſeemed to be much
about the age of <hi>Artaban,</hi> and though I cannot haply
ſpeak of <hi>Artaban</hi> without partiality, yet methinks, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
all things by the little notice I could take of him
in ſo ſhort a time, that either in point of beauty or
valour, this perſon was not inferiour to him.</q> 
                        <q>Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the deſcription you make of him, <hi>added the
Queen,</hi> I ſhould be almoſt perſwaded that it can be of no other
than <hi>Caeſario</hi> that you received that aſſiſtance, as being ſatisfied
that unleſſe it be <hi>Caeſario,</hi> no man can come ſo near, as you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
it, the valour and handſomeneſſe of <hi>Britomarus.</hi> Might
it pleaſe the gods, my moſt amiable Princeſſe! to afford me a
comfort ſo great as that of being certainly aſſured that it was
really he and no other, who had done us that ſervice. And
this I the rather wiſh, not onely out of a reflection that you
had received it from a Prince I infinitely love, and could not do
me the like more to my ſatisfaction in my own perſon then he
hath in yours, but alſo out of a conſideration that this action
might in ſome part take away the averſion which <hi>Artaban</hi> hath
for him, and might prove a likely means of a reconciliation,
and as it were a ſhort introduction to that Friendſhip which we
would eſtabliſh between them, as by fortune and the ſympathy
of our diſpoſitions it is effected between us.</q> 
                        <q>Do not I beſeech
you make the leaſt doubt, <hi>replied the Princeſſe,</hi> but that <hi>Artaban</hi>
will acknowledge this action with as much reſentment as I do my
ſelf, and aſſure your ſelf, that, if I have received this relief from
<hi>Caeſario,</hi> his endeavours to gain his friendſhip will be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the diſ-inclination he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>The two Princeſſes would have continued their diſcourſe for

                        </gap>ne out along with <hi>Cephira</hi> to take a little freſh air upon the
Terrace, comes into the chamber, and preſented her ſelf before
he Queen with a countenance wherein might be ſeen that the
owner of it was in no ſmall diſturbance and aſtoniſhment. <hi>Candace</hi>
having looked upon her, knew by her demeanour that ſhe had
ſomething to ſay to her: whereupon, cauſing her to come nearer,
ſhe commanded her to diſcover before the Princeſſe the cauſe of
that diſturbance which was ſo apparent in her countenance. <hi>Clitia</hi>
having looked about her, and perceiving there was none in the
chamber but onely <hi>Vrione,</hi> whom they were confident of, takes
the Queen by the hand, with a certain unuſuall eagerneſſe;
Madam, <hi>ſaid ſhe to her,</hi> the newes I am to acquaint you with, is,
no doubt, the beſt I could ever bring you; but indeed it is ſo
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:97242:102"/>
great that you may well pardon the diſturbance it hath put me
into and which you took notice of. <hi>Caeſario</hi> is in this pallace,
nay is come up upon the Terrace, and ſtaies at your chamber-door.
O ye heavenly Powers! <hi>Clitia, ſaies the Queen, in a
manner out of her ſelf,</hi> what doſt thou tell me? Is <hi>Caeſario</hi> at
my chamber-door? He is, replies <hi>Clitia,</hi> in the little Gallery
which abutts upon the terrace, where he expects my return
and your commands to waite on you. Taking advantage of the
night and the confuſed number of perſons that are in this palace
he hath made a ſhift to get in; and being acquainted with all
the paſſages of the place, as having not onely been born here,
but ſpent his youth in it, he hath without any difficulty got to
your lodgings, and hath walked upon the terrace, till ſuch
time as he ſaw me appear, and, by the diſcourſe I had with
<hi>Cephiſa,</hi> knew my voice. Whereupon, having called me
ſoftly by my name, he acquainted me with his own, and not
long after with his perſon, whereof I had an impreſſion ſo well
graven in my memory, that it would not have been very
hard for me to have diſcerned him in the greateſt darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                     <p>While <hi>Clitia</hi> gave this account of <hi>Caeſario,</hi> the beautifull
Queen was in a manner overwhelmed with an exceſſe of joy,
which, by a pleaſant authority, got the dominion of her Soule; and,
though fear and diſquiet endeavoured to diſturb it, yet was there
a neceſſity they ſhould give place to the firſt ſallies of that paſſion,
and ſuſpend their effect, till the firſt violence of the other were
ſpent. The Queen, caſting one arme about <hi>Clitia's</hi> neck, <hi>Ah</hi>
Clitia, ſaid ſhe to her, <hi>it is certainly decreed, that it is from you
I muſt expect all the moſt happy tidings, and it was you that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
brought me word into the garden at</hi> Meroe, <hi>of the life
and return of</hi> Caeſario, <hi>at a time when I bewailed his death, and that
I had renounced all the enjoyments of life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After ſhe had ſaid theſe words, ſhe would have put a hundred
queſtions to <hi>Clitia,</hi> and that all of a ſudden, upon that accident:
but ſhe told her, that the time ſhe had was to be otherwiſe ſpent,
and that ſhe muſt reſolve either to ſee <hi>Caeſario</hi> at the place where
he expected her return, or permit him to come into the chamber.
Now was it that fear began to diſturb her joy; and if, on the one
ſide, ſhe were ſatisfied to ſee her ſelf ſo near the Prince ſhe
dearly loved, ſhe trembled, on the other, when ſhe conſidered,
that he was in a Palace whereof <hi>Auguſtus's</hi> Lieutenant had the
command, and that a place where he muſt expect no leſſe than
to lay down his life, if he were diſcovered. This fear made her
to ſhake again, and put her to ſuch a loſſe that ſhe knew not what
reſolution to take, looking ſometimes on <hi>Eliſa,</hi> ſometimes on <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi>
as if it had been to aſk their advice what ſhe were beſt to do.
The fair Princeſſe of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> who had received ſo great
conſolations from the Queen, together with ſuch remarkeable
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:97242:102"/>
demonſtrations of Friendſhip, conceived her ſelf extreamly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
not onely in the joy, but alſo in the fear which ſhe now
ſtrugled with, and would have been as glad as the other to find
out a way to ſee <hi>Caeſario</hi> with as little danger as might be. But,
after they had continued for ſome time in uncertainty and at a
loſſe what courſe ſhould be taken, they at laſt thought it the ſafeſt
way that he ſhould be brought into the chamber, it being then
ſuch a time of the night that it was not likely they ſhould be
troubled with any more viſits, eſpecially there being convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
enough to hide him in caſe it were neceſſary, and that <hi>Clitia</hi>
proffered, aſſoon as ſhe had brought him into the chamber, to go
out upon the terrace along with <hi>Cephiſa,</hi> and to walk there a
while, to ſee if any body came by whom they might be ſurpriſed.
Beſides all which, it made ſomething for the ſecurity of the Prince
that he was, not onely, not known in <hi>Alexandria;</hi> but alſo his
death was more firmly believed there, then in any other part of
the world. Upon all theſe grounds ſummed up together, yet not
without a great deale of doubt and terrour, the Queen comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Clitia</hi> to go and fetch him in, whereupon <hi>Eliſa</hi> thinking her
ſelfe obliged in diſcretion and civility to go into her own cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that they might be at a greater freedome in that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view,
would have done it, but <hi>Candace</hi> embracing her would
not permit it, and entreated her to be preſent at her felicity,
as ſhe had been at the happy meeting between her and her
<hi>Artaban.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eliſa,</hi> at the entreaty of <hi>Candace</hi> ſtaies in the room, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
after <hi>Clitia</hi> returns, bringing along with her the ſon of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
into the chamber. At that firſt ſight, theſe two excellent
ſoules felt in a moment all that a paſſion ſuch as theirs could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
in a longer ſpace of time, and their firſt looks communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
one to another, of an inſtant, what their hearts meant of
greateſt tenderneſſe and paſſion. Aſſoon as ever the Prince ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
at the door, the Queen ran towards him, with an action,
whence he might eaſily infer, how welcome his preſence was to
her; and the ſon of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> kiſſed her hands and embraced
her knees with ſuch tranſportations of joy, as might well convince
her that his Love had not admitted of the leaſt diminution or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.
<hi>Candace,</hi> after ſhe had embraced him very earneſtly with
both her armes, while he was yet in that ſubmiſſive poſture, raiſed
him up, and entertained him with all thoſe Careſſes which were
ſuitable to her dignity and modeſty, conſidering withall the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of her affection. During the firſt expreſſions of their mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
ſatisfaction and joy, their diſcourſe was accordingly confuſed,
and incoherent; but when the violence of thoſe were over, <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dace,</hi>
retreating ſome few paces back, as it were to take the
better notice of the Prince; <q>What <hi>Cleomedon, ſaid ſhe to him,</hi>
the gods it ſeems have thought fit to reſtore you to me, after ſo
many dangers as I had run through my ſelfe, and ſo many
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:97242:103"/>
others wherein I had left you?</q> 
                        <q>But, Madam, <hi>replies the Prince,</hi>
it was then decreed I ſhould find you, after I had ſo unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
loſt you, and what is more, I do not onely find you living,
and full of goodneſſe for me, but I meet with you in <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
in the Palace of my Fathers; and in that very Chamber, wherein
I drew the firſt mouthful of air, and ſaw the firſt beams of light.</q>
                        <q>Tis an accident, I muſt confeſſe, <hi>replies Candace,</hi> that ſpeaks
ſomething extraordinary, and if you are ſurpriſed at it, I muſt
needs be not a little moved thereat. O how does this ſecond
life which I here receive, <hi>added the Prince,</hi> make the Palace of
the <hi>Ptolomey's</hi> much more dear and precious in my apprehenſion
then the former which I ought it, and how eaſily can I bear with
the loſſe of the command of it when I find therein what is a
thouſand times more dear to me then thouſands of Empires and
thouſands of lives.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this diſcourſe he would have added much more, to the ſame
effect, and the beautifull Queen, whoſe affection was not inferiour
to his, though, out of the civility and reſervedneſſe ſuitable to
her ſex, ſhe moderated her ſelf the more, looked on him with a
certain delight, and had pleaſantly ſeconded him her ſelf in the
expreſſions of his love, had ſhe not thought it unhandſome to
ſuffer any more, before the Princeſſe of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> till <hi>Caeſario</hi>
had taken notice of her and ſaluted her. Upon that account,
mildly interrupting him, ſhe obliged him to turn towards <hi>Eliſa,</hi>
and prepared him to ſalute her as the greateſt Princeſſe upon
earth, and the beſt friend ſhe had in the World. <hi>Caeſario,</hi> however
he might be tranſported at the ſight of <hi>Candace,</hi> was aſtoniſhed,
and in a manner dazled at that of <hi>Eliſa,</hi> and, coming neer her with
a reſpect, which her admirable beauty, and the words of <hi>Candace</hi>
eaſily forced him into, ſaluted her with ſuch ſubmiſſion, as the
moſt inconſiderable of mankind might do the heireſſe of the throne
of the <hi>Arſacides,</hi> and received from her all the civility ſhe could
have done him, had he been poſſeſſour of the Empire. He was
not at all ſurprized to meet with <hi>Eliſa,</hi> whom he knew before to be
in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and with <hi>Candace,</hi> but looking more earneſtly in her
face, he thought he had ſeen her that very day once before, and
the fair <hi>Eliſa</hi> taking more particular notice of him, diſcovered in
his, that he was the ſame man whom ſhe was talking of ſome
few minutes before, and who had that day relieved her againſt the
violence of the King of <hi>Media.</hi> She no ſooner perceived it, but
but her gratitude and acknowledgment working their effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her, ſhe turned towards <hi>Candace,</hi> with a countenance which
partly expreſſed the ſenſe ſhe had of that obligation. <hi>Madam,</hi>
ſaid ſhe to her, <hi>our wiſhes are accompliſhed, and if you find in this
Prince a perſon infinitely dear to you, I find in him, that of my
valiant defender, and look on him accordingly as one whom I ow,
not onely my liberty, but alſo the happineſſe I have to be bear with
you.</hi>

                        <hi>Theſe words put the Prince into a modeſt bluſh, and receaving
them with a bundance of ſubmiſſion;</hi> Madam, <hi>ſaid he to her,</hi> I
have done no more for you then you might have received from any
man whatſoever upon the ſame occaſion; but indeed it proved ſo
favourable and ſo glorious a one to me, that I ought to have hoped for
no leſſe in conſequence thereto, then the great happineſſe which I enjoy
this fortunate day.</p>
                     <p>Having thus expreſſed himſelf he thought himſelf obliged to
obſerve a greater reſervedneſſe in the preſence of <hi>Eliſa,</hi> as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
it not fit he ſhould diſburthen himſelf before her of all
that lay upon his heart. But <hi>Candace,</hi> taking notice of it, would
not ſuffer him to entertain any ſuch thought, and after ſhe had
looked on the Princeſſe with a ſmile; <q>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Princeſſe,</hi> ſince I have had ſufficient experience of your reſpect,
even ſo far, as not to fear any incivility from you even in deſerts,
and that the Princeſſe hath a greater goodneſſe and friendſhip
for me then to deny us that liberty, I muſt tell you that her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
obliges you not to any reſervedneſſe but what may be
expected only upon account of the reſpect due to her, and not
upon the ſcore of any circumſpection otherwiſe. And this you
may be confident of, in that before her I call you <hi>Caeſario,</hi> in
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> and you will haply be the more aſſured of it when
I ſhall have told you that ſhe is not onely acquainted with all
our adventures, but alſo, that ſhe is not ignorant of my moſt ſecret
thoughts.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Upon that aſſurance, and the freedom you are pleaſed to
afford me, <hi>replyed the Prince,</hi> I ſhall preſume, my faireſt Queen,
to aſk you what poſture my life and fortunes are in, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
you to let me know whether it be poſſible, that diſtance,
diſtractions, and the dangers whereto you have been expoſed,
have wrought any change in that fortunate condition to which
you had out of your own goodneſſe raiſed me? May I hope,
faireſt Queen, <hi>continued he (ſetting one knee to the ground,

                        <q>Tis enough, <hi>ſaid the Queen interrupting him, and forcing
him to riſe,</hi> it is enough, I doubt not but you could anſwer
that queſtion ſufficiently to your own ſatisfaction were you ſo
pleaſed, and I am in a manner confident, that you make not the

preſerved for you, amidſt traverſes of fortune as great
haply as thoſe that may have happened to your ſelf ſince our
ſeparation. Not but I muſt confeſſe, that I have been in more
than ordinary extremities, and my life and affairs in ſuch a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
that I ſtood very much in need of your aſſiſtance.</q> 
                        <q>Ah
Madam, <hi>replyed the Prince,</hi> I have underſtood no leſſe from
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:97242:104"/>
                           <hi>Eteocles,</hi> whom it hath pleaſed the gods to preſerve for my
comfort; he hath indeed given me an account of that dreadful
danger, whereto you were reduced, when you fell into the hands
of the Pirate <hi>Zenodorus,</hi> and that admirable reſolution which
your vertue inſpired you with rather to ſacrifice your life to
flames and waves, then to ſuffer any violence.</q> 
                        <q>It is poſſible, indeed,
<hi>added the Queen,</hi> that that action might proceed purely from
my vertue; but I muſt withall entreat you to conceive your ſelf
a little obliged to me in it, and accordingly believe, that the
deſign I had to preſerve my ſelf abſolutely yours to the laſt gaſp,
extreamly fortified me in that reſolution.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Caeſario</hi> was ſo ſtrangely tranſported with joy at theſe obliging
expreſſions, that he was at ſome loſſe how to ſignifie the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
he conceived thereof. And yet at laſt he made a ſhift to
do it, but with ſuch a diſorder and confuſion, as more truely
diſcovered the greatneſſe of his paſſion then the beſt couched
diſcourſe could have done. And when the Queen had ſuffered
him to recollect himſelf in that poſture, wherein ſhe beheld him
with abundance of pleaſure; <q>But is it juſt, <hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> I
ſhould be any longer ignorant, how, and by what adventure I
come to ſee you again, what good genius hath brought you to
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> and what fortunes you have run through ſince our
ſeparation? It is juſt, replyed the Prince, I ſhould give you an
account of what you were pleaſed to entruſt me with, and
acquaint you with the ſtate of a Kingdom which you thought
fit to leave to my management.</q> 
                        <q>That is not it, <hi>replyed the Queen,</hi>
which I am ſo deſirous to preſſe you to; and though I ſhould
be content to underſtand whatever you ſhall think worthy our
knowledge, yet this fair Princeſſe can ſatisfie you, that, in the
diſcourſes we have had together, ſhe hath obſerved, that the
loſſe of my Kingdom was not the thing I was moſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Your generoſity is to be admired, <hi>replyed the Prince,</hi> that is
ſuitable to your admirable perſon, and I cannot expreſſe the
experiences I have found of it, but by my ſilence and confuſion.
I ſhall therefore acquaint you, as well with what paſt at <hi>Meroe,</hi>
as what hath been done in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> ſince your departure
thence, whereof the relation cannot be long, becauſe it can
amount to no more then a diary of ſome few daies actions, and
afterwards, what hath happened to my ſelf, ſince it hath been my
buſineſſe to find you out,</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Now it comes into my mind, <hi>added Candace,</hi> when I enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
this fair Princeſſe with a relation of our adventures, I
forgot, to give her an account after what manner you got off from
that bloudy battel, which with a handful of men you gave the
great and numerous army of <hi>Tirabaſus,</hi> and where you were
left for dead, and paſſed for ſuch in my apprehenſion, as you did
in the general opinion of all the World, till the day that I ſaw
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:97242:104"/>
you again in the garden at <hi>Meroe.</hi> And though you ſince told
me ſomething of it, yet was it ſo confuſedly that as well for
that reaſon, as that I thought not fit to confound that diſcourſe
with the perfect relation I had to entertain the Princeſſe with of
other things, I made not the leaſt mention thereof. So that it
ſhall be your buſineſſe to acquaint her with that particularity,
which is all ſhe wants of your adventures to your returne to
<hi>Meroe,</hi> and then we ſhall be glad to know what hath happened
to you, ſince my departure thence. The diſcourſe you have to
make, you will, I know, contract what you can, by reaſon of the
diſturbance I ſhall be in, if you make any long abode in this place,
where I cannot look on you without fear, as knowing what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
you expoſe your ſelf to.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>With theſe words the Princeſſes having called <hi>Vrinoe,</hi> who
onely remained in the Chamber, entreated her to take ſuch order
as that there ſhould not come neer them any of the ſlaves that
had been appointed to waite on them, and to have a care with
<hi>Clitia,</hi> that they might not be ſurpriſed. After this precaution
given, the Prince having ſeated himſelf between them, as the
Queen had commanded him, after a recollection of ſome few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,
to recal into his mind, the things whereof his diſcourſe was
to conſiſt, began it at length in theſe terms.</p>

                        <p>I Muſt needs confeſſe that in the battle wherein, with 16000.
men, the greateſt part wounded and unfit for ſervice, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
with an Army of 100000. I did not do like an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
General, or a man that had before commanded Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and gained Victories. But it is alſo to be acknowledged,
that it was not out of any hope of victory, that I came into the
field, but meerly out of a deſire to dye, proceeding from the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
whereto the misfortunes of my great Queen had reduced
me, and to endeavour even at my death to ſhake, if not overthrow,
the perfidious uſurper of her Crown and Liberty. Beſides, having
conſidered all things, I found my ſelf not in a condition to make
my party good by retreating before the army of <hi>Tiribaſus,</hi> which
was come of a ſudden upon us into that very field, where not
many dayes before I had defeated 35000. men, and killed <hi>Antenor,</hi>
the Brother of <hi>Tiribaſus,</hi> by whom they were commanded. I ſhall
not therefore ſpend any further time to juſtifie that action, which
will be thought more pardonable, among perſons prepoſſeſſed by a
violent paſſion, ſuch as was that of mine, then among perſons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
in the buſineſſe of war; and conſequently ſhall onely
tell you, that I was not fortunate enough to effect what I had
undertaken, though I had the happineſſe to ſee <hi>Tiribaſus</hi> fall in
the midſt of his men with two or three wounds about him, and
had this comfort in my misfortune, that, with the loſſe of my
own; I ſaw the field covered with a number of carkaſes three
times greater then that which I could make when I firſt came
into it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="205" facs="tcp:97242:105"/>
At laſt it was my lot to fall, loaden with wounds, amongſt
thoſe that covered the ground with their carkaſes, and, as my
good fortune would have it, my faithfull Governour <hi>Eteocles,</hi>
who ſtill kept as near me as he could, having fought it out a little
longer, fell alſo not far from me, with ſuch wounds about him,
as had deprived him of all ſence and apprehenſion. The Enemy
ſpent the remainder of the day in ſhipping the dead, and in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
or burning their friends, but in regard that about that place
where we were, the air was grown a little infectious by reaſon of
the precedent battle, the Generalls thought not fit to make any
longer ſtay there, and thereupon marching all away in the night,
they encamped at a good diſtance thence upon the way to <hi>Meroe</hi>
inſomuch that there were none left in the Fields but the
dead, or at leaſt what were thought ſuch by thoſe that left
them.</p>
                        <p>Now the wounds of <hi>Eteocles</hi> proving not very great, and that
his weakneſſe proceeded not ſo much from their danger as the
great loſſe of blood he had undergone, he made a ſhift to recover
himſelf aſſoon as it was night, and I am in this extreamly obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to him, that e're he had beſtowed many minutes to reflect
on the condition he was in himſelf, he came to ſee what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of me. He ſought me out, and with much ado found
me, notwithſtanding the darkeneſſe, becauſe I was not far from
him, and crawling along as he could to get a little nearer me, he
came and felt me all over, trying by all the waies he could whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there were any life in me. The cold air of the night ſtayed
the bleeding of my wounds, inſomuch, that <hi>Eteocles</hi> finding me
cold as ice all over, his firſt apprehenſions concluded me abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
departed this world, but at laſt laying his hand on my breaſt,
he found by the palpitation of my heart, that there were ſome
ſmall remainders of life in me. The weak hope which this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
diſcovery raiſed in him, filled him with all the joy he
could, in that condition, be capable of, and though he took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of paines about me to recover me to ſome degree of
ſenſibility, yet all his endeavours proved ineffectuall, inſomuch
that the whole night, which at that time of the year, was of the
ſhorteſt, was over e're he could do any good with me. He many
times endeavoured to get upon his feet, and to go ſeek out
ſome held, but his weakneſſe was ſuch that he was not able, and
e're he could halfe get up, he fell down again by me. I ſhall not
trouble you either with the complaints that fell from him, or
the griefe it was to him, that he could not effect what he
deſired, and it were but to make my relation the more tedious to
inſiſt upon ſuch frivolous particulars.</p>
                        <p>The Sun was gotten into his chariot when I firſt began to open
my eies, and to breath, in ſuch manner that <hi>Eteocles</hi> perceived it.
He immediately creeps neerer my face, almoſt out of himſelfe
for joy, gave me ſo many kiſſes, and ſpoke to me with ſo much
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:97242:106"/>
earneſtneſſe, that at laſt he abſolutely recovered me to life again.
I began to feele and to ſee, but had not the power to ſtir, and
though I ſaw <hi>Eteocles,</hi> yet did I not perfectly know him, but as
it were by ſome broken remainders of an Idaea halfe forced out
of my memory. In the mean time he perceived it was impoſſible
for him any way to relieve me, and though he ſaw I was come to
my ſelfe, yet did he in a manner put it out of all queſtion that I
would die for want of aſſiſtance, and, out of the fear he was in
it might ſo come to paſſe, he importuned heaven with cries and
exclamations, and did all that lay in his power to call in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body
to our reliefe. Yet were they not his cries that wrought
that effect; but it happened by an adventure very ſtrange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected,
whereof, for many reaſons, I thought fit to give the
Queen but a ſlender and imperfect account, but ſhall now relate at
large, ſince it hath been your pleaſure to command it from
me.</p>
                        <p>I had already made a ſhift to open my eies fully, though all I
could do was onely to ſtir them a little, when <hi>Eteocles</hi> heares the
neighings of certain horſes and the noiſe of their going, which
made him imagine that there were ſome people coming towards
us. He thereupon lookes about him, and perceives a chariot
coming into the field, among the dead bodies wherewith it was
covered, and a man riding on horſeback before the chariot, as
if he had been a guide to thoſe perſons that were within it.
Thoſe were onely two women, one whereof filled the aire with
the dolefulneſſe of her Lamentations, and there followed the
chariot onely three ſlaves, all aſoot. At laſt, when they were
come quite into the field, the heaps of dead bodies hindering
the paſſage of the chariot, the women, that were within it, were
forced to alight, and the man, that was on horſeback having done
the like, took the more conſiderable of the two by the arme, and
led her towards the place where we were. <hi>Eteocles,</hi> whom this
accident put into a great hopes of relief, took very much notice
of all that paſſed, and diſtinctly heard the mournfull cries and
expoſtulations of that diſconſolate Lady, which certainly were
ſuch as might have been heard many Stadia's. Her hair was looſe
and diſhevelled, as if ſhe had been fallen into ſome extravagance,
her eies ſhowred down teares, her breaſt almoſt rent with the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of herſighes, in a word, her deportment was no other then
that of a perſon diſtracted and ready to fall into deſpair.
<q>Terrible death, <hi>cried ſhe,</hi> implacable devourer of mankind,
which appeareſt to me here in ſo many formes! is it poſſible,
that in this place, where thou haſt exerciſed thy power with
ſo much cruelty, thou ſhouldſt forbear to diſpatch one miſerable
creature that defies thee, or that thou canſt deny her thy aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
after thou haſt deprived her of all that could oblige her
to ſhun thy face. Inſatiable Goddeſſe, to whom my malicious
Fortune hath ſacrificed all that the earth had that was amiable
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:97242:106"/>
in my ſight! is it poſſible thou ſhouldſt avoid an unfortunate
woman as I am, while thou cutteſt off ſuch noble lives? and that,
more inhumane in thy compaſſion than thy cruelty, thou muſt
needs ſtrike a thouſand times at a heart which there needs but
one blow to deliver from thy Tyranny.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here ſighs and ſobs made a patentheſis in her diſcourſe forſome
minutes; but ſoon after, reaſſuming it with an accent much more
dolefull; <q>Teramenes, <hi>continued ſhe,</hi> my dear <hi>Teramenes,</hi> where
art thou? why doſt thou conceale thy ſelfe from me? O thou
body that I have loved beyond all things; why doſt thou hide
thy ſelf from her eies that was ſometimes ſo dear to thee? Art
thou afraid, thy countenance covered with the horrours of death
might frighten me, or that it will be a leſſe delightfull object to
me in that figure, then it was in that wherein I was ſo much ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with it? No, no, my deareſt <hi>Teramenes,</hi> even under that
dreadfull livery, under that irremiſſible ice of death, I ſhall
think thee amiable, and it may not haply be impoſſible, I ſhould
by my kiſſes reſtore to thee ſome part of that which thou haſt
loſt, and reinfuſe into thy cold body that ſoule which thou
hadſt enflamed with a fire that death it ſelf is not able to put
out.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>At this paſſage ſhe made a little truce with her Lamentations,
but it laſting not above a minute or two, ſhe turnes her ſelf to the
man that conducted her: <q>But Pelorus, <hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> where
is then the body of <hi>Teramenes?</hi> You ſhewed me this place, with
a confidence it was that where I ſhould infallibly find it, and
yet, among this vaſt number of carkaſes I ſee not that of my
<hi>Teramenes.</hi>
                           </q> 
                           <q>Fear not, Madam, <hi>replied the man to whom ſhe ſpake</hi>
it will not be long e're we find it, for now we are come to the
place where I ſaw him fall yeſterday by the hands of <hi>Cleomedon.</hi>
No doubt, but he came by his own death out of the over
earneſtneſſe he had to revenge that of your Brothers, who died
by the ſame hand in the former battle, as alſo out of an exceſſive
deſire to have the honour of diſpatching with his own hands a
Prince of ſo great a fame. <hi>Cleomedon</hi> falling at his feet drew
him upon him, and with that little remainder of ſtrength he
was yet maſter of ran him into the throat with a dagger which
he had ſtill in his hand. <hi>Teramenes,</hi> though mortally wounded
with that thruſt, made a ſhift to get off the body of the expiring
<hi>Cleomedon,</hi> but after he had ſtaggered a little, he fell down with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſome ten paces of him, and, by reaſon of the bloud which,
coming out abundantly, hindred his reſpiration, died imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Ah cruell man, cries out the Lady, ah inhumane ſtranger,
whom I had never any waies injured, and that leaveſt thy native
ſoile to bring death after ſo many ſeverall waies into the breaſt
of the innocent <hi>Eurinoe!</hi> May it pleaſe the gods, ſince I have
no other revenge either to take or deſire upon thee, that thy
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:97242:107"/>
body may be the prey of Vultures, and that thy ſhade may
eternally wander amongſt the moſt unfortunate ones, without
ever obtaining of the infernal Gods any other reſt then what
thou leaveſt this miſerable woman, Thou hadſt opened the
ſluces of my tears by the death of a brother I infinitely loved,
which thy unmerciful arms had deprived me of not many daies
before; but thou thoughtſt it not ſufficient to aſſault my ſelf only
upon the account of <hi>Blood,</hi> and <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> without ſacrificing
to thy cruelty, whatever there is in Love that is moſt paſſionate
and moſt violent in the death of my <hi>Teramenes.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>While ſhe diſburthened her grief by ſuch expoſtulations, he,
who conducted her ſhewed her the body ſhe looked after, which
lay not above fifteen or twenty paces from us, and it was upon the
cruel ſpectacle, that the deſperate woman caſting her ſelf on the
cold body with a great cry, fell into a ſwound, which for ſome
time interrupted her lamentations, and found theſe perſons that
were about her work enough to relieve her. For my part, I had
not the leaſt apprehenſion of any thing that paſſed, though I had
my eies open, wherewith, all I could do, was to look on the deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Eteocles.</hi> But he had not miſſed one of theſe words, and was
infinitely troubled to find himſelf ſo far from the relief he had
expected upon that accident, as not doubting but that I ſhould
be diſcovered and known by thoſe exaſperated perſons, if they
ſaw me, and that, in the rage which then poſſeſſed them, they
would take away thoſe ſmall remainders of life there were in me,
rather then any relieve me. On the other ſide he ſaw me
drawing towards my end, and was ſenſible he ſhould dy himſelf,
if he were not aſſiſted, and in that perplexity, not knowing
what reſolution to take, he lifted up his eyes to Heaven, and
deſired that of the gods, which he thought it vain to expect from
men.</p>
                        <p>In this interim the woman comes to her ſelf again, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
diſcovered it by her mournful groans and la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>ntations:
ſhe embraced the frozen carkaſe, and beſtowed thouſand of kiſſes
on a face all covered with bloud, and that with ſuch tranſporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as from whoſe violence <hi>Eteocles</hi> could inſer no leſſe then that
that of her love had been extraordinary. <q>Dareſt <hi>Teramenes,
ſaid ſhe,</hi> ſometime the enlivening light of my dayes, but now a
Luminary eclipſed by the interpoſition of eternal darkneſs! Are
theſe the happy Nuptialls that were prepared for ourſelves, and
after the faithfull teſt of ſo many traverſes and misfortunes, is
it in this fatal field that I was to enjoy thee? Dear ſhade, which
by an unhuman thruſt haſt quited this body, the object of my
trueſt affections, and wandreſt yet about theſe ſhores in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſepulture! Infinitely beloved ſhade, doſt thou forſake
me for ever? And is it poſſible thou ſhouldſt ſeek reſt while thou
leaveſt me in diſturbances a thouſand times more inſupportable
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:97242:107"/>
then that death which ſnatches thee from the embraces of thy
faithful <hi>Eurinoe?</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Many other exclamations to the ſame effect fell from her, ſuch
as were the ſad effects of her deſpair, and which <hi>Eteocles</hi> would
have hearkned to with more patience; but the danger wherein
we were, or rather the deſperate condition of our lives, took up
his thoughts ſo much, that he could not afford her any longer
attention. But indeed it was not long ere he had another motive
to diſcover us, when the man that waited on that afflicted Lady,
being come neerer me, and having preſently known me, out of a
confidence he was of that I had fallen in that place, and knew me
very well by ſight, perceived withal that my eyes were open, and
that I was not quite dead. They had not ſtripped me naked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the abundance of bloud that was about my cloaths, but
they had taken away the excellent armour wherein I had fought,
and whereby I was ſo remarkable in the battel. <hi>Eteocles</hi> had
wiped the bloud off my face, ſo that the man could with leſſe
difficulty know me again, and thereupon returning immediately to
his Lady: <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>if revenge may abate any thing
of your grief, lay hold on the opportunity which the gods favour you
with to offer a noble ſacrifice to the Manes of</hi> Teramenes. <hi>Here,
behold not onely his murderer, but the murderer alſo of your brother,
is yet alive, and the juſt gods ſeem to have reſerved thoſe little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
of life which he hath yet left purpoſely that they might in
ſome meaſure ſatisfie your revenge:</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Never did any Tigreſſe fly out with ſo much fury at thoſe that
had carried away her young ones, as that exaſperated and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
woman did upon thoſe cruel words. She laies hands on a
dagger which ſhe ſpyed lying on the ground among other arms,
and running to the place where the man pointed, ſhe was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
with me, looking on me with eyes ſparkling with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet ſo as through which ſatisfaction ſhe conceived at her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
reveng, did in certain intervals, ſhew it ſelf. <hi>Teramenes,</hi>
cryed ſhe, <hi>I am now going to ſacrifice to thee all that is remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of thy executioner, and ſhall meet with thee again with
greater joy, when I ſhall have appeaſed thy Manes with this
victime.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>With theſe words ſhe comes up cloſe to me, (who was lying on
my back with my face directed to Heaven, and my eyes open,
which I weakly faſtened on the objects, yet ſo as that I was not
able to diſcern what paſt) and lifting up her arm to thruſt the
weapon into my breaſt, it was coming downwards upon me, when
<hi>Eteocles</hi> lifting himſelf half up, put forth his hand, and, laying
hold of hers with greater force then in all probability he ſeemed
to have had in him; <hi>Hold thy bands, cruel woman,</hi> ſaid he to her,
<hi>ſpare the bloud of the gods, and do not, by the cruelty, ſhorten, for
ſome, few minutes, the nobleſt life in the World.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Eurinoe</hi> was ſo ſurpriſed both at the action and the words of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:97242:108"/>
                           <hi>Eteocles,</hi> that the dagger fell out of her hands, and ſhe was at ſuch
a loſſe as to all reſolution, that ſhe could onely look on the man
whom the gods ſeemed to have purpoſely raiſed up to prevent
the effect of her reſolution. But at laſt her paſſion being ſtill the
moſt predominant in her mind, her rage grew more violent then
it had been before, and running to another weapon which ſhe ſaw,
not far from her. <hi>Do not hope,</hi> ſaid ſhe to Eteocles, <hi>thou ſhalt
divert me from the ſacrifice which I owe my</hi> Teramenes, <hi>and be
content with this comfort, that his executioner hath but thoſe
weak remnants of life, whereas I ſhould wiſh him a hundred lives,
that I might take a nobler revenge of them altogether.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>With theſe words ſhe comes to me on the other ſide, and at a place
where the aſſiſtance of <hi>Eteocles</hi> would have ſtood me in no ſtead;
deſirous to execute her revenge with a grater ſatisfaction, ſhe
would needs look upon me, and ſo as ſhe lifted up her arm fixed
her eyes on my countenance. <hi>Eteocles</hi> hath told me ſince, that even
in that languiſhing poſture wherein I then appeared to the ſight of
<hi>Eurinoe,</hi> there was ſomething in me more beautiful then ordinary:
my eies looked more gently, becauſe I looked more dejectedly
then I ſhould have done otherwiſe, and my hair ſtained with bloud
in ſome places, playing with my cheeks, by reaſon of a little wind
that then blew, heighthed the little beauty which ſtill remained
in my face, whereof the paleneſſe muſt needs be thought an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
whitneſſe, in a Country where ordinary degrees of whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
are thought rare and admired. In fine, for my part, I know
not with what advantage I appeared in the ſight of that incenſed
woman; but the arm ſhe had lifted up remained in that poſture,
and at the ſame time having gently turned my eies upon her,
with a feeble groane, her indignation was diſarmed at that
object, and the weapon fell out of her hand the ſecond
time.</p>
                        <p>The man that waited upon her, thinking he did her a very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
ſervice in egging her on to take the intended revenge,
put the weapon into her hand the third time, and encouraging her
to the action ſhe would have done, was ready to help her to put it
in execution, when the woman looking very paſſionately upon him;
<hi>Hold thy hands,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>it is not the pleaſure of the gods
that I ſhould put</hi> Cleomedon <hi>to death.</hi> The man, who was, on the
other ſide, as ready to obey her, was quiet, and <hi>Eurinoe</hi> having
ſate her down ſome few paces from me, began to look very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
upon me, and ever and anon diſburth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ned her ſelf of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſighs which her breaſt was not ſtrong enough to keep in. She
looked ſtill more and more earneſtly, and the more ſhe looked on
me, the more ſhe ſeemed to ſtruggle with her paſſion, and by all
her deportment it was eaſily viſible to thoſe that took notice of
it, that there paſſed ſtrange things in her ſoul, and that there was
an engagement of paſſion there, whereof ſhe was not over-confident
which ſhould have the victory. Sometimes ſhe would take her
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:97242:108"/>
ſight off my countenance with ſome ſignes of reaſſuming her reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution;
but preſently after ſhe would faſten her eies on me again
with greater earneſtneſſe then before, and during thoſe uncertain
and impetuous motions which raiſed ſuch a tempeſt in her ſoul,
ſhe with much ado made a paſſage for certain ſighs. Which when
ſhe had diſburthened her ſelf of, <hi>Cruel man,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>loud enough to
be heard by</hi> Eteocles, <hi>who was the next man to her, fatal enemy of our
houſe, muſt thou needs, after thou hadſt triumphed over the life of
my Brother and my Lover, proſecute thy victorious arms even into
my heart?</hi> With theſe words ſhe held her peace, and obſerved,
not without confuſion, that <hi>Eteocles</hi> might have over-heard
them.</p>
                        <p>I here entertain you with a diſcourſe not much conſiſtent with
the modeſty which is natural to me, and which <hi>Eteocles</hi> might
better have undertaken than my ſelf; but it was your pleaſure to
command it, and I know not any reaſon whereby I may be diſpenſed
from the obedience I owe you.</p>
                        <p>While the woman was ſtill ſtruggling with the incertainties ſhe
was in, and that by ſeveral diſcoveries it was viſible, that ſhe was
guided by a paſſion contrary to that which a little before had put
the weapons into her hand to diſpatch me; <hi>Eteocles,</hi> who, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the extremity whereto he was reduced himſelf by reaſon
of his wounds, was ſatisfied of the truth of his obſervation. Being
accordingly deſirous to make what advantage he could of the
adventure, wherein he could not but imagine ſomething miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and extraordinary, and looking on <hi>Eurinoe</hi> in a very ſubmiſſive
manner: <q>Fair Lady, <hi>ſaid he to her,</hi> ſince your indignation hath
ſubmitted to your pitty, be not generous by halves, and conſider
with your ſelf, that to thruſt a dagger into the breaſt of <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and to leave him without relief in the condition whereto
you now ſee him reduced, is, no queſtion, one and the ſame
thing. Let your vertue have an abſolute conqueſt, in favour of
a Prince who hath offended you onely through his misfortune,
and will ſerve you by his acknowledgments, if the gods ſhall,
through your aſſiſtance, prolong his life.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Eurinoe</hi> needed no more prevalent ſollicitation to oblige her to
do a thing which ſhe was earneſtly bent to do, and thereupon
giving <hi>Eteocles</hi> an immediate anſwer; <q>I ſhall ſatisfie your deſires,
<hi>ſaid ſhe to him.</hi> I ſhal relieve <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> though he be the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer
of both my Brother and my Love; and the gods who were
not pleaſed he ſhould receive his death at my hands, command me
to preſerve his life, if it be poſſible.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>With theſe words turning to the man that accompanyed her;
<q>Pelorus, <hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> the hazard I run in this action is very
great, and, beſides the report I am to fear by doing this good
office to him that hath ſhed the bloud that was ſo dear to me,
you know I have yet one brother left about <hi>Tiribaſus,</hi> exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
to the revenge of his own relations, and without doubt
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:97242:109"/>
an irreconcileable enemy of <hi>Cleomedons.</hi> But I have ſo great a
confidence of your fidelity, that all my hope is in it, and I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
inclined to believe, that you will not betray this ſecret,
and will afford me your aſſiſtance upon an occaſion of ſo great
conſequence.</q> The man, who was become abſolutely her
creature by the death of his Maſter, complyed with her in
all things, and promiſed her to be as ſecret as ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
                        <p>But why ſhould I importune you any longer with the relation of
particulars of little conſequence? By the command of <hi>Eurinoe,</hi>
and the care of thoſe that were about her, a horſe-litter was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
and brought to the place where we were, into which I was
put, and <hi>Eteocles</hi> by me, and we were conveyed as gently as could
be poſſible, to a caſtle which was but one houres riding from that
place, where we were at firſt diſpoſed into ſeveral beds, but in the
ſame chamber, <hi>Eteocles,</hi> it ſeems being very unwilling to be in any
other place then where I was.</p>
                        <p>But now give me leave to beg your attention, O ye great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes,
and withall your aſtoniſhment, at what I have to tell you,
or at leaſt be pleaſed to infer thence the conſtancy of thoſe affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which ſeem to be the moſt violent. You have heard the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
I have given you of the affliction <hi>Eurinoe</hi> was in for the
loſſe of her <hi>Teramenes,</hi> as alſo of her lamentations and her deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
full of deſpair and extravagance, which in all probability
were the expreſſions of the moſt violent love that a ſoul could be
capable of: and now you are to know that when ſhe left the place,
whence ſhe cauſed us to be conveyed away, ſhe hardly ſo much as
thought on him, or at leaſt beſtowing all her pains on the living,
who might ſtand in need of her aſſiſtance, ſhe thought it enough
to give <hi>Pelorus</hi> order to cauſe the body of <hi>Teramenes</hi> to be carryed
away, and to ſee it buried.</p>
                        <p>They preſently ſent into the next Town for Surgeons, by whom
we were dreſſed with much ſecrecy, taking great care they ſhould
not come to the knowledg of my name who knew me not by ſight.
And theſe being excellent men in their profeſſion, their endeavours
proved ſo ſucceſſeful on me, that, ere that day was paſſed, they
brought me abſolutely to my ſelf again, and within a few dayes
after undertook to <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> and <hi>Eteocles,</hi> that I ſhould not dy of
my wounds. I have underſtood ſince that <hi>Eurinoe</hi> entertained
that aſſurance with as much joy as if her life were concerned in the
preſervation of mine; but for my own part, I can truly affirm that
I received it without any, and that after I had recovered my memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and began to make my firſt reflections on the wretched con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
I was in, I had almoſt caſt my ſelf, through my own deſpair
into that danger out of which they took so much pains to deliver
me. Whereof this certainly muſt be the reaſon, that the violent
deſire of death which had forced me to engage in the ſight, being
not yet gotten out of my mind, I ſhould in all likelihood have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:97242:109"/>
what that inſpired me with, and had rendred the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of thoſe that took ſo much trouble upon them about my
recovery, abſolutely ineffectuall, had it not been for the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
ſollicitations and importunity of <hi>Eteocles,</hi> for whom I
have ever had a very great eſteem and a moſt affectionate
friendſhip.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall not trouble you with a repetition of all thoſe reaſons
whereby he endeavoured to make me apprehend, that I did not
onely betray a great want of prudence, but that I was guilty of a
capitall crime againſt my Love, by courting my own death, at a
time, that my life might be neceſſary for the Queens ſervice, and
that ſince I had not received any tidings that ſhe was either dead,
or married to <hi>Tiribaſus,</hi> there was no reaſon I ſhould ruſh into
extremities which I might overtake time enough, when thoſe
misfortunes were come to paſſe. To be ſhort, he preſſed theſe
things to me with ſo much reaſon and conviction, that I began to
acknowledge the truth of them, and to ſubmit to his judgement,
that it was not well done of me, to hazard upon ſuch light grounds
a life which I had beſtowed, and conſequently could not diſpoſe
of my ſelf, while ſhe that was the Miſtreſſe of it, might expect
any ſervice out of it. Upon this conſideration I was content they
ſhould endeavour my recovery, and entertained with great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements
the care they took of me.</p>
                        <p>Aſſon as I had arrived to ſuch a degree of recovery as that I
was able to endure diſcourſe, <hi>Eteocles</hi> came and told me what
place I was in, and by what adventure I was brought thither, and
at the ſame time acquainted me what averſion <hi>Eurinoe</hi> had had
for me upon account of the death of her Brother and her Love,
and what affection ſhe had conceived for me of a ſudden. Now
his health being in a much better poſture then mine, as having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
over keeping his bed, while I was yet in great danger, he
had had more leaſure to informe himſelf of all that he was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to know, and had underſtood that <hi>Eurinoe</hi> was a widow of
very great quality, that her friends and her huſband had alwaies
kept her at a diſtance from the Court, that ſhe had had two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
very deeply involved in the intereſts of <hi>Tiribaſus,</hi> whereof
the younger was ſlain in the late Battle, and the elder had ſtaied
at <hi>Meroe</hi> by the orders of <hi>Tiribaſus,</hi> who affected him very much,
and repoſed great truſt in him; that ſhe had been very earneſtly
courted, ſince her widow-hood, by that <hi>Teramenes,</hi> on whom
ſhe had beſtowed, ſo many teares, a perſon it ſeems of very great
worth and very amiable as to his perſon; that ſhe had loved him
very dearly, and that after many great traverſes and revolutions
ſhe was upon the point of marrying him with the conſent of her
friends, when death deprived her of him. <hi>Eteocles</hi> acquainting
me with all theſe things, told me withall how circumſpectly I
ſhould carry my ſelf, that I might not be diſcovered by any other
perſons then thoſe whom <hi>Eurinoe</hi> was forced to truſt with that
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:97242:110"/>
ſecret, not doubting but that, if ſuch a misfortune ſhould happen
my life muſt needs be in manifeſt danger, as well by reaſon of the
rage of <hi>Eurinoe's</hi> brother, as the near relation he had to <hi>Tiriba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>
who, out of all queſtion would never ſuffer me to live, ſhould
he once find out where I were retired. But, as things ſtood, the
ſecurity of that ſecret conſiſted not altogether in our circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
for <hi>Eurinoe</hi> was ſo much concerned in it her ſelf, not onely
out of the deſire ſhe had to preſerve a perſon on whom ſhe had
beſtowed her affection; but alſo for fear of her brothers indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whoſe ſavage humor ſhe was acquainted with, that ſhe omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
nothing which in point of care or caution might be expected
from her.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall not preſume, my great Princeſſes, before you, whoſe
beauties eclipſe what ever is beautifull in all nature, to ſay any
thing of the beauty of <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> but certainly among the beauties
of the rank next inferiour to the firſt and chiefeſt, the might very
well paſſe for a handſome woman, ſomewhat duſkiſh, not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
black, the lineaments of her face very good, of a good ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and in a word one of the handſomeſt perſons that ever I
met with in <hi>Aethiopia.</hi> I ſhould commend her farther, were it
not that you would imagine, faireſt Queen, that in the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of her beauty, I ſhould have no other deſign, then to celebrate
my own ſidelity.</p>
                        <p>Aſſoon as I was grown any thing capable of converſation, I
had her perpetually at my bed-ſide, and I ſoon obſerved in all
her deportment what <hi>Eteocles</hi> had told me before of her affection.
Her modeſty indeed was ſuch, that ſhe would not in words diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
what her heart was burthened with; but her eies betraied
ſome part of it, and all her actions ſufficiently confirmed the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
which <hi>Eteocles</hi> had made of her. During ſome few
daies, at firſt, while the ſucceſſe of my recovery was yet doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and my fever very violent, ſhe ſaid little to me, and I ſaw
her not but at ſome certain times; but when I was a little reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
and permitted to diſcourſe, ſhe was very liberall of her
company. She was one day at my bed-ſide, where ſhe ſeemed
to be extreamly ſatisfied to ſee my health in ſo good a poſture,
when I, venturing to ſpeak, more than I had done before, took
occaſion to give her thanks and to make all the acknowledgement
I could of her care and tenderneſſe towards me, and commended
the generoſity ſhe exerciſed towards a man who had been of a
party contrary to that of her Friends, and withall ſo unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
as by the chance of war to do her a diſpleaſure. She pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
bore with my diſcourſe, and taking her advantage of my
ſilence, <q>My lord, <hi>ſaid ſhe to me,</hi> I have done no more for you
than your vertue deſerved; but ſhall entreat you not to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
meerly to a conſideration of generoſitie all that I have done
to ſerve you. After you had not onely been the death of my
Brother, but alſo deprived me of a perſon I infinitely loved, and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:97242:110"/>
one with whom I was upon the point of marriage, there was
no reflection of generoſity ſtrong enough to oblige me to do an
action, whereby, I cannot but incur, if it be known, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
of all the world, and the indignation of all my kinred,
and you may therefore well judge, that it muſt proceed from
ſome more powerfull motive, that I conceived my ſelf engaged
to relieve you. I ſhall take it upon what ground you pleaſe,
<hi>replied I,</hi> but you will give me leave to imagine that it is meerly
to your goodneſſe that I am to attribute the aſſiſtances I have
received from you, ſince I had not any waies deſerved them.
If it be meerly upon the account of <hi>goodneſſe, replied ſhe with a
ſigh,</hi> alaſſe! how fatall will that goodneſſe prove to me, and
if I am onely <hi>good</hi> to you, how <hi>cruell</hi> am I to my ſelf! It would
be an infinite trouble to me, <hi>replied I,</hi> to think that the good
offices you do me ſhould cauſe you any diſpleaſure, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when my health ſhall be in another poſture than it is now,
I ſhall heartily ſpend this life, which I have received from your
courteſie to protect you againſt whatever you may fear. You
your ſelf, <hi>ſaid ſhe, caſting down her eies with a bluſh which cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
all her face,</hi> you are the moſt dreadfull of my enemies, the
onely perſon I can fear, and the onely man againſt whom you can
offer me your aſſiſtances.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe words, though I were not at all ſurpriſed thereat, put
me to ſuch a loſſe that I knew not what anſwer to make her, and
ſeeing me ſilent as ſeeking what to ſay; <q>It plainly argues in
you, <hi>added ſhe,</hi> an exceſſe of cruelty to pretend your ſelfe ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of my condition, after what you have diſcovered your
ſelf, and what you might have underſtood from <hi>Eteocles.</hi> You
cannot be yet to learn that miraculous alteration of my heart
and ſentiments, which, by reaſon of the inexpreſſible ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of it, muſt needs proceed from ſome ſuperiour power,
or a ſtrange fatality e're it could paſſe out of one extremity into
the other. It is impoſſible you ſhould not take notice of its
engagement in my actions ſince, and in fine you but too too well
perceive all the tranſactions of my ſoule, for me to trouble my
ſelf to acquaint you therewith by my diſcourſes. I am not
naturally very much inclined to make declarations of this kind,
but I have not been able to contain my ſelf in an adventure abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
prodigious, and whereof all the conſequences muſt needs
be extraordinary.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here <hi>Eurinoe</hi> put a period to her diſcourſe not without great
diſcoveries of confuſion, and I was in too much diſorder my ſelf,
not to be aſtoniſhed thereat, as perceiving my ſelf reduced out of
neceſſity, to act a part for which I had ſo much averſion. I
thought it fit to make her ſome anſwer, and after I had ſtudied
ſometime to dreſſe it with ſuch obliging expreſſions as that I
might neither engage my ſelf nor deceive her; <q>Madam, <hi>ſaid I
to her,</hi> I now perceive I am much more happy than I thought
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:97242:111"/>
myſelf, ſince I muſt infer from your diſcourſe, (it being your
pleaſure I ſhould) that I owe that to your <hi>affection,</hi> which I
thought my ſelf obliged for onely to your <hi>pitty.</hi> This hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
is too great not to be eſteemed and acknowledged by a
perſon that hath the leaſt pretence to reſpect and gratitude, and
I muſt therefore promiſe you that you ſhall find my heart as
well furniſhed, as to that point, as you can deſire your ſelf.</q>
This was all I ſaid to her for the firſt time, and I was not able
to judge, whether ſhe were ſatisfied or diſpleaſed at it, for that
<hi>Pelorus,</hi> whoſe fidelity ſhe began to miſtruſt, comes into the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
which obliged her to fall upon ſome other diſcourſe, and not
long after to leave the roome.</p>
                        <p>The diſcoveries of this affection of <hi>Eurinoe</hi> had made ſome
further impreſſions upon me, if my ſoule had not been then
ſtrugling with other afflictions which I thought more inſupportable
and if the knowledge I might have had of the extremities where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my Queen had been reduced thorough the Tyranny of <hi>Tiriba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>
had not tormented me with ſuch a violence as afforded me
but little leaſure to think of any thing elſe. Wo is me! what
cruell reflections was I perſecuted with at that time, and how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the daie, did I repreſent to my ſelf that my faireſt Queen
was fallen into the power of <hi>Tiribaſus,</hi> and, it may be, upon
termes of yeelding to his violence? Then was it that I ſeriouſly
repented me of my raſhneſſe in purſuing my own death, at a time
that I ſhould moſt have huſbanded my life to do her further ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
and I thought that if I had minded my own ſafety, I might
have been able, alone, and by ſome other waies, to take away
<hi>Tiribaſus'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </hi> life in the midſt of all his Guards. That which ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated
my grief, was, that I durſt neither enquire after any
newes from the Queen, nor give any credit to what I heard rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in that place, as being ſuch as I could not but ſuſpect. On
the other ſide I could well remember that juſt upon my engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the battle, I had writ her a Letter, whereby I gave her
to underſtand, that I was going to inevitable death, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
made no doubt, but that the newes of my departure
was ſoon brought her, and ſpread all over <hi>Aethiopia.</hi> And th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

I ſaw muſt needs prove prejudiciall to me two waies, either by
expoſing her to a grief for my loſſe, proportionable to the firſt
experiences I had received of her favours, or by exempting her,
by my death, from the obligation ſhe had to my Love, and the
promiſe ſhe had made me.</p>
                        <p>I was ſo tormented with theſe cruell reflections that I ſaw there
was no remedie, but patiently to expect my recoverie, and to
haſten it all that lay in my power, it being not to be expected I
ſhould there meet with any expreſſe meſſenger whom <hi>I</hi> durſt truſt

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:97242:111"/>
dangers, if my abode there were diſcovered. I therefore reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
with much difficultie, to complie with the preſent neceſſity,
muſtring up all the forces of my mind to my aſſiſtance in that
emergencie; while in the mean time my faireſt Queen was ſtill
in my thoughts, and her idaea, as it was the cauſe of all my ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
was alſo the ground of all my conſolations.</p>
                        <p>That part of the Caſtle into which we were diſpoſed was at
ſome diſtance from all the reſt, ſo that thoſe perſons that were in
the others, knew nothing of what was done where we were,
<hi>Eurinoe</hi> having ſo ordered things that all was carried on with the
greateſt caution and ſecrecy imaginable. By this means had I all the
accommodation and attendance I could deſire, inſomuch, that,
having kept my bed a moneth, I at laſt began to ſit up, and to
walk a little about the room. Now had I ſo much of <hi>Eurinoe</hi>'s
company, that ſhe was in a manner never from me, making it her
buſineſſe, by all her diſcourſes, though ever cloathed with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
enough, to convince me of the greatneſſe of her affection.
I, on the other ſide, expreſſed my ſelf with as much acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as I could poſſibly, of the obligations I ought her, as
well becauſe I thought it no more then civility to do ſo, as upon
the advice of <hi>Eteocles,</hi> who would not have me by any means to
exaſperate her, and was afraid of the dangers it was yet in her
power to bring us into.</p>
                        <p>But ſhe in the mean time was not ſatisfied with my ſimple civilities,
and expected I ſhould engage my heart in a love proportionable to
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rs towards me. I, on the contrary, avoided all the occaſions of ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing to her which might diſpleaſe her, though I ſaid not
ought that the might be miſtaken in, or on which ſhe might ground
any thing of affection. But one day, after ſhe had preſſed me very
much to reſolve on ſomething, yet in a way full of ſweetneſſe and
modeſty, I thought fit to diſcover my thoughts more particularly
then I had done any time before. Looking on her therefore in the
moſt obliging manner I could; <q>Faireſt <hi>Eurinoe, ſaid I to her,</hi> I have
this unhapineſs for one, among many others that are my perpetual
attendants, that I cannot convince you of the ſincerity of my
intentions, and the real acknowledgments I have for all the great
demonſtrations you honour me with of your affection. This mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
happens to me, for that I really have too great an eſteem
for you, to make proteſtations to you beyond what I am able to
make good; but ſince you will needs oblige me to open my heart
to you, with that freedom which I owe a perſon to whom I owe
my life, and of whom I have received ſuch extraordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of affection, I muſt tel you, faireſt <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> that, ſince you
are acquainted with my name and perſon, it is not to be doubted
but you have had ſome account of my life, and conſequently
know how far I am at liberty to diſpoſe of my affections. There
are few perſons in <hi>Aethiopia</hi> but know it, and therefore without
obliging me to diſcover my ſelf any farther, be pleaſed to reflect
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:97242:112"/>
on what I can, and what I ought to do, and aſſure your ſelf that
I ſhall be infinitely deſirous to afford you all the expreſſions of
my reſentments that I poſſibly can.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Eurinoe</hi> ſeemed to be a little daſhed at this diſcourſe, and it was
ſome time ere ſhe could make any anſwer thereto, but at laſt,
having ſufficiently recollected her ſelf; <q>I have, indeed, with all
the Kingdom, <hi>ſaid ſhe to me,</hi> heard of the love you have for the
Queen, the great actions you have done for her ſervice, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
which the late King had to beſtow her on you, and the
hopes you may, upon juſt grounds, have conceived, that you
may obtain her, and I am not ſo far blinded by my paſſion, but
that I am ſufficiently ſenſible of the diſparity there is, as well
in regard of nature as fortune, between <hi>Candace</hi> and <hi>Eurinoe,</hi>
upon the account both of quality and beauty; nor is my extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance
come to that height, as that I would diſpute with Queen
<hi>Candace,</hi> the poſſeſſion of a heart to which ſhe hath any preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
But my Lord, you are withal not ignorant, how that, on
that ſide, all your hopes are blaſted, that <hi>Candace</hi> hath now loſt
both her Kingdom and her liberty, and that all the good intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſhe may have for you, ſtand you in no ſtead. She hath haply
beſtowed her ſelf on <hi>Tiribaſus,</hi> who is maſter of her perſon as
well as of her dominions; and the inclinations ſhe hath had for
you, if they have not already, will no doubt give way to that
cruel neceſſity, which allows her not the liberty to make choice
of a huſband.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe words, wherein I perceived there was abundance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bality
and truth, came very neer my heart, and not being able to
conceal it from <hi>Eurinoe;</hi> 
                           <q>The news you tell me is very doleful,
<hi>ſaid I to her,</hi> and yet you tell me nothing but what I knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
I have been acquainted with the uſurpation of <hi>Tiribaſus</hi>
and the captivity of <hi>Candace,</hi> but I know withal, that the gods
are juſt and omnipotent, and that by a turning-caſt of their power
and juſtice, they may overturne <hi>Tiribaſus,</hi> and raiſe <hi>Candace</hi> into
the Throne. There have been ſeen among men revolutions as
ſtrange as that, and we muſt not quit hope till the utmoſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of misfortune.</q> But ſuch a hope as that, <hi>replyed Eurinoe,</hi>
cannot be well grounded, and as it is not impoſſible but you
might alone counterballance, and haply overturn the fortune of
<hi>Tiribaſus,</hi> if you had had ſufficient forces to oppoſe him, for you
are not ignorant that there is not any body left which he needs
fear, or that can with any probability prevent his eſtabliſhment
in <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> I can do it yet my ſelf, <hi>ſaid I to her, not able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe
my thoughts, what neceſſity ſoever there were I ſhould do it,</hi>
I may yet haply thwart that fortune which you think ſo well
eſtabliſhed, and put him to as great a hazard upon the uſurped
throne he is in, as he was in when he had the command of a
hundred thouſand men. Ah, my Lord, <hi>replies Eurinoe,</hi> truſt not
too much to that unfortunate preſumption. Your courage is
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:97242:112"/>
ſufficiently known, but Fortune is not your friend, and your life
is dearer to me then that I can, without trembling, reflect on the
danger you muſt expoſe your ſelf to. Your fear, <hi>ſaid I, ſmiling,</hi>
is haply for <hi>Tiribaſus,</hi> as knowing well that a miſerable perſon
that is careleſſe of his own life, may endanger thoſe of the moſt
powerful and moſt fortunate. Cleomedon, <hi>ſaid ſhe to me,</hi> you
do not, I hope, any way doubt, but that your life is much dearer
to me then that of <hi>Tiribaſus,</hi> ſince I value it above my own. I
ſhall not take the pains to perſwade you any further as to that
point, but ſhall onely adde thus much, that how far ſoever my
brothers have been wedded to his intereſt, whether upon the
account of fortune, or ſome allyance that was between our
houſes, and though <hi>Teramenes,</hi> (whom when living I loved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

<hi>Cleomedon</hi>) was very much in his eſteem, I could never, for my
own part, approve his proceedings, nor conceive any reſpects for
an ujuſt man and an uſurper.</p>
                        <p>She would have ſaid more, had it not been for <hi>Eteocles</hi> coming
into the room, before whom ſhe would not inſiſt any longer on
that ſubject. In the mean time, my greateſt care was to haſten my
recovery, being upon thorns to faſten on ſome occaſion to ſacrifice
the remainders of my life, with ſome advantage, to the ſervice of
my faireſt Queen. But the more I recovered my health, the more
did <hi>Eurinoe</hi>'s diminiſh, inſomuch, that at laſt ſhe was brought ſo
low by that unfortunate paſſion, that I could do no leſſe then pitty
her, if I may uſe that term with modeſty, and was extreamly troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
that I could do nothing to comfort her.</p>
                        <p>I was at laſt grown ſo ſtrong, that I durſt venture out of my
chamber, and to go into a fair garden where ſhe would needs have
me to walk with her. I did it, though with much difficulty, ſhe
being forced to help me ever and anon by reaſon of my weakneſſe.
'Twas in this place that ſhe made her complaints to me with more
freedom then ſhe could do in the chamber, and vvhere I vvas ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times extreamly put to it, though I am obliged to give her this
character, that, in all the moſt violent expreſſions of her paſſion,
I never obſerved any thing to fall from her that was unhandſome
or prejudicial to modeſty. I urged to her, but to no purpoſe, the
fidelity I ought to the Queen, and one day above all having preſſed
it to her more earneſtly then at other times; <q>Cruel man, <hi>ſaid ſhe to
me,</hi> you have but that onely argument to elude me withal, and
I am confident, that it is without any hope that you make it a
cloak for your cruelty. I have told you ſeveral times, that I
would not diſpute your heart with <hi>Candace,</hi> could you but think
of her with any likelyhood of obtaining her; but you know
well enough that ſhe is loſt as to you, and yet thruſt a dagger into
the breaſt of an unfortunate woman who loves you but too well,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:97242:113"/>
and pretend fidelity to a perſon that cannot think on you, and,
no doubt, does not.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe words, which I was extreamly moved at, furniſhed me
alſo with an anſwer thereto, wherewith I thought ſhe would be
in ſome meaſure ſatisfied; yet ſo as that I ſhould not ſtand engaged
to any thing, and thereupon taking her by the hand, and wringing
it, with an action that argued ſomething of a paſſionate affection
more then ordinary; <q>Madam, <hi>ſaid I to her,</hi> it is no ſmall affection
to me to find you ſo doubtfull of the ſincerity of my heart;
but ſince you are ſo incredulous, I muſt make you one over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
more, which ſhall abſolutely convince you of my reality.
Since therefore you have already declared that you would not
diſpute my heart with <hi>Candace,</hi> and that it is onely upon the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
of her loſſe that I muſt be yours, I proteſt to you, by all
the gods, in whoſe preſence we now are, and make a ſolemn
vow to you, ſuch as nothing ſhall ever oblige me to break, that
if <hi>Candace</hi> be loſt as to me, and that I ſurvive her loſſe, I ſhall
never love any thing but the fair <hi>Eurinoe.</hi>
                           </q> Though ſhe could
not derive any advantage from theſe words, if rightly underſtood,
and that I hazarded nothing by promiſing not to love ought but
her, in caſe I could love any thing after the loſſe of <hi>Candace,</hi> yet
I obſerved that this diſcourſe wrought that effect which I expected
it ſhould, and that ſhe was ſo ſtrangely appeaſed, that for many
daies her thoughts were in a more then ordinary ſerenity, during
which time I grew ſtronger and ſtronger, inſomuch that I
thought my ſelf able, within a few days to get on horſe-back.</p>
                        <p>Now was it that my diſquiets perſecuted me afreſh, as having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
armour, nor horſes, and knowing no means how to procure
any, but onely through the aſſiſtance of <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> whom I was very
much afraid to make any propoſition to upon that account, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
confident ſhe would do all that lay in her power to prevent my
departure at leaſt as long as ſhe could. And certainly I was not
miſtaken in the opinion I had conceived of her, and accordinglie
as ſoon as ſhe underſtood, that I was upon ſome reſolutions to be
gone, ſhe was ſo extreamly troubled at it, that I thought it would
have proved impoſſible to comfort her. This put me into a ſtrange
diſturbance, as well out of the fear I was in, that her deſpair
might produce ſomething that ſhould prove prejudicial both to
her ſelf and to us, as the improbability there was I ſhould get out
of her houſe, in the condition I then was in, without her conſent,
or indeed without her aſſiſtance. My thoughts were continually
employed in finding out ſome expedient, and conſulting with
<hi>Eteocles,</hi> who was to ſeek in it as much as my ſelf, when our diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
were determined by an adventure that happened, and at which
you will not haply be a little aſtorniſhed.</p>
                        <p>During the time that <hi>Eurinoe</hi> was troubled moſt with a fear of
my departure, and that I found my ſelf in ſuch a condition as that I
might get on horſeback within three or four dayes, ſhe took me
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:97242:113"/>
along with her, as ſhe had done diverſe times before, to walk in
the garden. And in regard I had now fully recovered my ſtrength,
ſhe carryed me into the moſt ſolitary walks, and moſt remote,
having with her that Gentlewoman, whom ſhe had entruſted with
this ſecret from the beginning, as if ſhe ſtood much upon the
decorum and civility ſhe had alwayes obſerved towards me. After
we had taken ſome few turns, we ſate down upon a ſeat made of
turſs, at the end of a walk, on both ſides of which was a high and
thick hedge-row, and there, after ſhe had ſpent ſome time in the
remonſtrances ſhe ordinarily entertained me with. <q>How cruel
man, <hi>ſaid ſhe to me,</hi> can you poſſibly prevaile with your ſelf to
forſake me, and leave me in an indignation that I have made no
impreſſion upon your heart by ſo many demonſtrations, of a
perfect affection? It ſeems then, that neither what I have done
in order to your ſafety, nor what I have done againſt my ſelf by
expoſing my ſelf to the indignation and reſentments of my friends,
nor the violence I did for your ſake, to an ancient and earneſt
paſſion, could never move that inſenſible ſoul of yours, and you
make it a light matter to forſake me for ever, and to leave me at
a time, when you cannot doubt but that the loſſe of my life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
on that of your ſight.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>There fell abundance of other things from her, with ſuch a
torrent of words, as I knew not how to ſtand againſt. But when
that was ſpent, and that ſhe had given over ſpeaking, <q>Eurinoe,
<hi>ſaid I to her,</hi> I ſhall not leave you, till ſuch time as you give me
the liberty to do it, and ſhall be your ſelf ſatisfied that I ought to
be at a greater diſtance from you, as well in regard of your
concernments as my own. By the diſcovery I have made to you
of my thoughts you have underſtood that I am obliged to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
once more to do ſomething for the ſervice of an unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Princeſſe, to whom you know my life hath been long
ſince devoted, and I were unworthy your eſteem if I ſhould
baſely forſake her in the misfortunes whereto ſhe is reduced.
This is it I am obliged to do, as to what concerns my ſelf; and
for your part <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> you muſt give me leave to tell you, that
what may be thought lawful and haply commendable in your
carriage, during the extremities whereto my wounds had
brought me, would not be thought ſo after the recovery of my
health, and that it would prove very unhandſume, and much
prejudiciall to your reputation, that a perſon of my age, and
one to whom you pretend an affection ſhould make any longer
abode in your houſe. What may have been kept ſecret hitherto,
cannot be any longer, for time does at laſt diſcover things that
are moſt concealed. You have abundance of vertue, <hi>Eurinoe,</hi>
though you have been overcome by ſome paſſion, and it is your
vertue as much as the aſſiſtances I have received from you, that
I conceive my ſelf obliged to eſteem you for. Since then your
vertue is really more then ordinary, ſuffer it not to be ſtained
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:97242:114"/>
with thoſe ſpots, which it will be hard for you to get out again,
and endeavour to preſerve your reputation amongſt men by
actions conformable to thoſe of your life paſt. You will pardon
me for being ſo free as to give you this advice which, aſſure your
ſelf, proceeds from a heart full of grateful apprehenſions, as
alſo if I preſume to beg no other love from you, then ſuch as
you would afford a Brother, ſince that you perceive by the
poſture of my affairs, that I cannot love you otherwiſe then as a
ſiſter.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>I had not till then ſpoken in ſuch terms to <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> whence it
came that ſhe was the more ſurprized thereat, inſomuch, that for
a long time ſhe was not able to make any reply. And yet I think ſhe
had bethought her of ſomething to ſay, when our diſcourſe was
interrupted by a little noiſe which we heard behind the hedg-row,
againſt which we were ſate, and not long after, by the appearance
of a man, who, being come into the walk, made all the haſt he
could towards the place where we were. <hi>Eurinoe's</hi> thoughts being
employed at that time much more then mine, I took notice of the
man before ſhe did, and ſaw that he was of a very goodly preſence,
a noble and majeſtick air, and had a very fair countenance for a
man of that nation, though he ſeemed to be weak and brought
very low, and diſcovered in his eyes ſome dreadful reſolution.
Being, for my part, ignorant what occaſion might bring him thither,
I was very glad of a ſword I had by my ſide, which <hi>Eurinoe</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
me the day before, and had begun to wear it but that very day,
to make uſe of, if need were, in a Country where I was to ſuſpect
all things: but <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> who had thought before that it was
either <hi>Eteocles</hi> or <hi>Pelorus,</hi> caſt not her eies on him, till ſuch time as
he was come up almoſt to us. At the ſame time the woman that
was with her gave a ſhriek, which ſhe hearing, and endeavouring
to find the cauſe of it in the countenance of that man, ſhe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatelie
found it, when ſhe knew him to be her unfortunate <hi>Tera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi>
on whoſe death ſhe had beſtowed ſo many tears, and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
whoſe bodie ſhe had made ſo much lamentation, and done things
that ſufficientlie argued her extravagance and deſpair. At this
ſight ſhe gave a great ſhriek, as ſhe brought forth the name of
<hi>Teramenes,</hi> and the terrour ſhe conceived thereat was ſo great, that
ſhe fell into a ſwound upon the ſeat where ſhe was ſate. Her
action, that of the woman that was with her, and the name of
<hi>Teramenes,</hi> which they pronounced, put me into an imagination it
might be his ghoſt, or haply he himſelf preſerved by ſome
miracle.</p>
                        <p>During that uncertainty, retreating back a little, when he
was come up very neer us, and putting my hand to the hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
of my ſword; <q>Stand there, <hi>ſaid I to him,</hi> and if thou a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>
onely the ghoſt of <hi>Teramenes,</hi> diſturb not any further by
thy approaches, thoſe whom thy preſence hath frightned.
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:97242:114"/>
Were I onely the ghoſt of Teramenes, <hi>replied the man,</hi> it were
to thee that I ſhould addreſſe my ſelf, as having been my mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer;
but ſince I am <hi>Teramenes</hi> living, and recovered of the
cruell wound which <hi>I</hi> received from thee in the battle, thou
ſhalt not need to fear in this deplorable condition, him, whom
thou couldeſt look upon without any dread in the head of an
Army. I am <hi>Teramenes</hi> the over-faithfull Lover of that faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
woman, whoſe heart thou haſt gotten from me after thou
hadſt taken away my life not onely in her opinion, but in that
of all the world beſides. I was thine enemy upon the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>Tiribaſus</hi> who was my Friend; I became thy enemie
upon the wound I received from thy hands, which hath brought
me to the extremities of life and death, and <hi>I</hi> have yet a more
juſt ground to be thy enemie for the injurie thou haſt done
me in robbing me of the affections of <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> which <hi>I</hi> was in
poſſeſſion of, and had well deſerved. <hi>I</hi> muſt further acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that this laſt injurie though thou haſt done it innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
had armed me againſt thee; and that <hi>I</hi> came abroad this
day, though the firſt of my ſtirring, with a reſolution which
might have proved fatall to one of us; but the words that
have fallen from thee, and which <hi>I</hi> have over-heard, have
wrought a change in my thoughts, and <hi>I</hi> have found ſo much
vertue, prudence and goodneſſe in them, that they have taken
off all the indignation <hi>I</hi> had conceived againſt thee. <hi>I</hi> come
therefore, no longer as an enemie, but as a perſon that hath
a veneration for thy vertue, and as one that is an humble ſuitor
to that generoſitie, which thou diſcovereſt as well in thy actions
as thy words, to beg that heart of thee, which thou haſt taken
away from me, without making any advantage thereof, and
which thou keepeſt from me, yet wouldſt rather be without it.
Reſtore to me <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> a thing which thou haſt no mind to
preſerve, or if thou wouldſt be further revenged on the Friends
of <hi>Tiribaſus,</hi> behold the ſacrifice, which <hi>I</hi> ſhall now offer at
the feet of an ungratefull woman, of a life, which muſt now be as
deteſtable to her as my death was grievous at the laſt moments of
her affection.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>While <hi>Teramenes</hi> diſburthened himſelf after this manner, and
that I hearkened to him with attention and aſtoniſhment, <hi>Eurinoe,</hi>
by the aſſiſtance of her woman, and that of <hi>Eteocles</hi> and <hi>Pelorus,</hi>
who came in at the ſame time, was come to her ſelf again, and
might have heard ſome part of what <hi>Teramenes</hi> ſaid, while <hi>Pelorus,</hi>
who had caſt himſelf at her feet, aſſured her that he was really
living, and craved her pardon for having put ſuch a trick upon
her. The woman was ſo ſtrangely at a loſſe between horrour,
aſtoniſhment, ſhame, and, poſſibly, grief into the bargain, for
the return of a man ſhe had then no affection for, that ſhe knew
not in a manner where ſhe was, was not able to ſpeak, and had
not the confidence to look upon him. With this, ſhe found it no
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:97242:115"/>
ſmall difficulty to be perſwaded that <hi>Teramenes</hi> was living, though
<hi>Pelorus</hi> had, by proteſtations aſſured her of as much, as but
too too well remembring the laſt kiſſes ſhe had given his cold
and bloody body, and the orders ſhe had given for his enterre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>While ſhe was in this perplexity, <hi>Teramenes</hi> comes towards her,
though by her ſhrieks ſhe ſufficiently diſcovered the fear ſhe was
in he ſhould come near her, and thereupon ſtopping at the diſtance
of ſome few paces from her, becauſe he would not diſturb her
any further, and looking on her with a countenance wherein his
paſſion was extreamly viſible; <q>Is it poſſible, <hi>Eurinoe, ſaid he to
her,</hi> you ſhould be ſo much affrighted at <hi>Teramenes</hi> living, when
you could find in your heart to give him kiſſes when he was
dead, and waſh his face with ſo many teares! But can I think
that change any miracle, cruell and ungratefull <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> when
I am ſo well acquainted with that of your ſoule; and that I am
not ignorant, how that, in the ſame minute, you were ſeen to
paſſe from, the effects of the moſt violent paſſion in the world,
to a mortall oblivion of him that had adored you with ſo much
fidelity, and to new inclinations for a dying man, whom you
had never ſeen before, and one that had been the death of thoſe
perſons whom you thought deareſt to you. I return, <hi>Eurinoe,</hi>
I return, almoſt from hell to reproach you with your prodigious
inconſtancy, and the gods have been pleaſed to reſtore me to
life contrary both to your expectation and my own, that I might
come and repreſent to you, the many oaths and proteſtations
wherein you have called them to witneſſe, to your promiſes of
an eternall affection for me. Is it poſſible that you can call them
to mind without remorſe and confuſion, and can ſo many demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations
of my love, which you ſometime valued at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
rate, come into your memory, and not raiſe in you either a
ſecret grief or a ſecret repentance? Your hand was lifted up
to thruſt a dagger into the heart of my Murtherer, and by an
extravagance of paſſion, you were hurried into extremities not
ordinary to your ſex, when that fatall ſight gave a check to
your cruelty, and that new love, poſſeſſing it ſelf of your ſoule
in an inſtant, forced thence the unfortunate <hi>Teramenes</hi> in ſuch
manner, that you hardly remembred he had once lived. In the
mean time, my life was preſerved to my greater misfortune, and
I wiſh it had pleaſed the gods to have put a period to it at that
very minute when your affection ceaſed, and that their aſſiſtance
and that of men had not proved ſo effectuall as to reſtore it me,
to make me fall into the greateſt unhappineſſe that ever man
groaned under. Do you imagine, <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> that heaven hath
not a puniſhment for ſo ſtrange an inſidelity, and that the
cries of a deſperate and an injured Lover, will not bring upon
your head thoſe misfortunes which his Love permits him not to
wiſh you.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="225" facs="tcp:97242:115"/>
To this effect was the diſcourſe of <hi>Teramenes,</hi> which fell from
him with a certain action, that raiſed in me abundance of pittie,
and he would have ſaid more, had not the exceſſe of his grief
prevented him, when <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> having quite recovered her ſelf, as
convinced, both by the things which ſhe heard, and by what <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorus</hi>
had told her, would needs ſtop the torrent of his words.
Whereupon, ſmothering that confuſion and remorſe which had tied
up her tongue ſo long, ſhe looked on <hi>Teramenes,</hi> not without ſome
remainders of the fright he had put her into; and not long after,
venturing to ſpeak, though with difficulty enough; <q>Whatever
thou art, <hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> whether the Ghoſt of <hi>Teramenes,</hi> or
<hi>Teramenes</hi> himſelf alive, thou haſt filled my ſoule with terrour
and aſtoniſhment, and I cannot look on thee in that condition,
after I had honoured thy cold and bloody body with the laſt
demonſtrations of my Love, but I muſt needs be diſturbed at ſo
ſtrange an adventure. Aſſure thy ſelf therefore that what thou
haſt obſerved in my countenance is meerly the effect of that
trouble, and not of that confuſion and remorſe which thou
doſt reproach me with, and though it might haply have proved
more advantageous to my ſelf to have continued my affections
to thee even after thy death, ſince it was decreed thou ſhouldſt
come to life again, yet is it certain that thou haſt loſt them by
a misfortune which I have not any way contributed to. With
what juſtice, <hi>Teramenes,</hi> canſt thou charge me with any infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
towards thee? Have I been any way backward in the Love
I had promiſed thee to the very laſt minute of thy life, or did
we perſwade one another that our Love ſhould laſt beyond this
life? What law is that which engages one to this eternity of
affection towards the dead, or by what ſymptomes, could I judge
that thou ſhouldſt return to life, after I had cauſed thee to be
brought out of the Field in order to thy buriall? Thoſe demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations
of love which I gave thee, and what elſe thou maiſt
have underſtood from the unfaithfull <hi>Pelorus,</hi> were they the
effects of an ordinary paſſion, and was there not ground enough
thou ſhouldeſt be ſatisfied with a paſſion which engaged me to
do things beyond the bounds of reaſon? To revenge thee, I
became, contrary to my naturall inclinations, more cruell than a
Lyoneſſe, and would have attempted the life of an expiring
Prince, at whoſe ſight even Tygreſſes would have been moved
to compaſſion. If I therefore were moved thereat, if the will
of the gods, and generoſitie obliged me to aſſiſt him, and if
ſince, (as thou art too well informed to be denied any thing)
his excellent endowments, or ſome ſuperiour irreſiſtible power,
have forced my inclinations, and taken that place in my heart,
which was not to be eternally kept empty for one that was dead,
doſt thou find in this misfortune that horrid infidelity which
thou reproacheſt me with, or didſt thou imagine that my obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
were as great to thy ghoſt, as they were, while living, to
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:97242:116"/>
thy ſelf? No <hi>Teramenes,</hi> think not that thou canſt accuſe me with
any juſtice, and if thou haſt been ſo unhappy to looſe my affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
by an adventure ſo prodigious quarrel, with heaven,
whoſe will it was it ſhould be ſo, and not with my will which
hath contributed nothing thereto. As to the misfortune which
thou bewaileſt ſo much, my condition is not a jot happier than
thine, and thou maiſt elſewhere find a better fortune than thou
canſt expect with the unfortunate <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> while in the mean
time it is deſtined ſhe ſhould be eternally miſerable, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to that chaſtiſement of heaven, which thou ſaieſt muſt fall
upon me, and which indeed I have already felt.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The period of this diſcourſe of <hi>Eurinoe's</hi> was a ſhower of tears
which it lay not in her power to keep in any longer. Whereupon
<hi>Teramenes</hi> whom it put to the extremity of grief, by reaſon there
could not be a greater confirmation of the reality of his unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
caſting a dreadfull look upon her: <q>No, no, Eurince, <hi>ſaid
he to her,</hi> I ſhall accuſe you no longer, but acknowledge with
you, and ſubmit to that irreſiſtible power which hath forced
your inclinations. But in regard my life might do your reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſome prejudice in the world, though my tongue were ſilent
and that it is not to be doubted but that I am now as abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as ever I was amiable in your ſight, it is but juſt my life
ſhould here determine, and that in ſuch a manner, that you
may not be therein miſtaken a ſecond time. The greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
I now have at my death, is, that I leave you an unfortunate
woman, and if the vertue and conſtancy of <hi>Cleomedon</hi> could
but give him leave to forget <hi>Candace</hi> to enjoy you, as you have,
to gain him, forgotten <hi>Teramenes,</hi> the laſt intreaty I were to make
ſhould be, that he would be leſſe cruell to her, and not
aggravate any further a revenge which I deſire not you ſhould
take.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>With theſe words he drew out a dagger he had about him, and
liſting up his hand, would have thruſt it into his breaſt, if I had
not faſtened upon him, and ſtaied his hand, though onely with ſo
much force as to prevent him from executing his reſolution.
<hi>Teramenes,</hi> perceiving his deſign fruſtrated, looked on me very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbedly,
and endeavouring to ſnatch the dagger which I had
taken out of his hands; <q>Cleomedon, <hi>ſaid he to me,</hi> content
your ſelf that the experience I have of your vertue, hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
ſo far upon me, that I would not have the effects of my
deſpair fall upon you, and ſince I am willing to ſpare thoſe by
whoſe means I am become miſerable, purpoſely that <hi>I</hi> might
execute all my revenge upon my ſelf, hinder me not from free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my ſelf from thoſe miſeries which <hi>I</hi> groan under upon your
account. I will hinder you to lay violent hands on your ſelf,
<hi>ſaid I to him,</hi> if it lie in my power to do it, and it ſhall not be
my fault, if you do not find out ſome expedient beſides that
of death, to get out of thoſe misfortunes whereof I am the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:97242:116"/>
innocent cauſe. <hi>Eurinoe</hi> knows very well, that it is not upon
any hopes that I have given her that ſhe perſeveres in the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which ſhe hath for me, and I here give you a full diſcovery of
my thoughts, when I tell you, that I ſhould think my ſelf a very
wretched perſon, and abominable in the ſight of Heaven, if a
love ſo faithful as yours ſhould come to an unfortunate end by
my means.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Having with theſe words taken away the dagger from <hi>Tera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi>
I turned towards <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> in whom the deportment and
laſt words of her huſband had raiſed ſome compaſſion, I ſaid
to her all thoſe things which pitty could ſuggeſt to me on her
behalf, and alledged to her all the reaſons which I thought might
any way oblige her to diſ-lodge me out of her heart, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admit
her faithful <hi>Teramenes.</hi> For ſome time ſhe was not able to
make me any anſwer, other then that of a ſhower of tears, which
being at laſt over, ſhe very earneſtly reaſſumed the diſcourſe, and
charged me with the greateſt cruelty and ingratitude imaginable.
I heard all with abundance of patience, and not diſcovering the
leaſt trouble thereat, I took occaſion to repreſent unto her, what
might be the conſequences of an obſtinate perſeverance, in a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
paſſion, and that directed to a man engaged in another love,
one that was ready to take his leave of her, and ſhould not haply
ever ſee her again; nay, which is more then all, one, that, though he
were not called away by the affection he had for the Queen, could
not make any abode with her, but to the utter ruine of her repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
beſides the little probability there was ſhe would be ſo
extravagant, as to entertain in her houſe the murderer of one
of her Brothers. To this I added what ſhe might fear from her
other Brother, who was ſtill with <hi>Tiribaſus,</hi> and that ſhe muſt
needs expect he would have ſome deſignes, not onely againſt her
life, but mine alſo, as being dear to her, but that, on the contrary,
ſhe could not but be happy with <hi>Teramenes.</hi> it being out of all
doubt that he had an extraordinary affection for her, ſince the
demonſtrations ſhe had received thereof were very remarkable:
that he was approved and recommended to her by her friends,
and, in a word, that it was the onely means to make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure
not onely in her own mind, but alſo in her houſe and
fortunes.</p>
                        <p>While I thus diſburthened my thoughts to <hi>Eurinoe, Teramenes,</hi>
having caſt himſelf at her feet, bathed them with his tears, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that, whether it were upon that ſpectacle, which ſtirred up
in her the embers of her former affections, or that ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of the reaſon and truth of the things I repreſented to
her, and withal loſt all hope of being loved by me, and haply
imagined ſhe might never ſee me again, after a doubtful engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
wherein we ſpent the beſt part of the day, ſhe at laſt began
to yield. Whereupon looking on <hi>Teramenes,</hi> with a milder coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:97242:117"/>
then before, ſhe turned towards me, and told me ſhe
would do what I ſhould adviſe her to, and that, being become mine
through the means of ſome unknown power, ſhe now ſubmitted
again to the ſame power, which ſhe was not able to reſiſt. <hi>Tera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi>
almoſt out of himſelf for joy, after he had given thouſands
of kiſſes to her feet, caſt himſelf at mine, embracing me by the
knees, calling me the authour of his ſafety, and his tutelary angel,
and making all the earneſt proteſtations he could to me, that he
would heartily ſpend, to do me any ſervice, that life which I had
prevented him from deſtroying, and made him happie in. And
knowing on the other ſide that <hi>Eurinoe</hi> might be in ſome fear he
ſhould afterwards remember the change that had happened in her
affections, and accordinglie conceive ſome diſcontented thoughts
of the love ſhe had ſome time had for me, he, to rid her of that
fear, made thouſands of proteſtations to her, that it ſhould never
come into his mind again. He told her that he abſolutely attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
that accident to the extraordinary merit of <hi>Cleomedon,</hi>
which might produce no leſſe miraculous an effect any where: but
in fine, that, however he might ſeem to quarrel with her, he was
confident of her vertue, not onely upon the former expreſſions
ſhe had made thereof, but alſo from that very demonſtration of it,
which, when he leaſt expected any ſuch thing, he had heard from
the mouth of <hi>Cleomedon;</hi> that, for my part, he ſhould never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the leaſt jealouſie or ill thought of me, out of a confidence I
ſhould never prove unfaitful to <hi>Candace,</hi> either for <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> or any
other perſon in the World.</p>
                        <p>Here am I forced to contract my relation, for that, ſhould I make
it my buſineſſe to repeat all the diſcourſes which paſſed upon this
occaſion to ſatisfie and convince <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> it would take up more
time then I have ſpent in the account of all I have given you
already. At laſt I made an abſolute reconcilation between <hi>Tera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi>
and <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> who endeavoured, all that lay in her power,
to conceal before him, the violence ſhe did her ſelf upon that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and prevalid with her ſo far upon the earneſt intreaties of
that Lover, that I got her to promiſe that ſhe would be married to
him before my departure thence, as ſhe might very well do, being,
as ſhe was, altogether at her own diſpoſal, and knowing withall
that her marriage with <hi>Teramenes</hi> was approved of, and deſired by
all her friends.</p>
                        <p>At laſt we would needs know of him, how he had recovered to
life, and had carried his buſineſſe ſo ſecretly that <hi>Eurinoe</hi> never ſo
much as ſuſpected any ſuch thing. He, in few words, acquainted
us, how that, after we had been brought into the Caſtle, <hi>Pelorus</hi>
returning to the place, where he had left him, with a letter to
carry him away, found him recovered out of that mortal ſwoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wherein he had continued all the night, and ſome part of the
day; that this man, being one that had been brought up in his
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:97242:117"/>
ſervice over-joyd at the accident, had taken ſuch pains about him,
that at laſt he brought him ſo far to himſelf, that he was ſenſible
of what was ſaid to him. To this <hi>Pelorus</hi> added, That <hi>Teramenes</hi>
had commanded him to carry him to <hi>Eurinoe's,</hi> as having no place
where he might well retire any neerer, and that thereupon he
had been forced to acquaint him with the truth of all that had
paſſed, as having far greater reſpects for his Maſter then he had
for <hi>Eurinoe:</hi> That <hi>Teramenes</hi> had almoſt dyed in good earneſt at
that cruel news, and that nevertheleſſe, out of a deſire to ſee the
conſequences of that adventure, and to apply thoſe remedies
which time and his own reſentments ſhould ſuggeſt unto him, he
was content to be carried to a houſe that belonged to a Siſter of
<hi>Peloruus</hi>'s, not far from <hi>Eurinoe</hi>'s Caſtle, where he might not onely
be privately looked after in order to his perfect recovery, but alſo
be in a place, where he might every day underſtand, by <hi>Pelorus,</hi> what
was done at <hi>Eurinoes:</hi> That all things came to paſſe as <hi>Teramenes</hi>
had deſired, and that he had been waited on and dreſſed with
ſo much care as might be, by perſons concerned in his wellfare,
and ſuch as had not anyway betrayed the ſecret committed to their
truſt: That this had been done with the greater eaſe, by reaſon of
<hi>Eurinoe</hi>'s continual employment about me, and the little curioſity
ſhe was then guilty of, to enquire what was done in her neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood:
That he brought <hi>Teramenes</hi> notice every day of what was
done at the Caſtle, in regard he might go and come to his Siſters
houſe without the leaſt ſuſpicion: That <hi>Teramenes</hi> conceived ſuch
a grief and affliction thereat, that many times he was upon the
point of diſcovering all, not doubting but that <hi>Tiribaſus,</hi> and
<hi>Eurinoe</hi>'s Brother, and all of that party would ſoon find out
ſome means to diſpatch me, when they were once acquainted
with the place of my abode, but that he had been perſwaded
to the contrary, partly by his intreaties, who deſired him to
delay it, and partly by thoſe remainders of love which he ſtill
had leſt in him for <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> for whoſe ſake principally it
was that he forbore putting that bloudy deſign in execution;
that at laſt, through the aſſiſtances of thoſe that were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
about his recovery, he was come to the poſture of
health wherein he ſaw him, and that having notice given him,
that <hi>Eurinoe</hi> and my ſelf walked every day in the Garden,
he would needs come thither, to over-hear our diſcourſe,
if it were poſſible, and to take his opportunity to be revenged
of me in ſuch a manner as might leaſt prejudice the reputation
of <hi>Eurinoe;</hi> That he had many times over-heard our diſcourſe,
through the hedge-row, but that in thoſe which I made to
<hi>Eurinoe,</hi> he had found ſo much prudence and vertue, that he
immediately changed his reſolution, and that perceiving I had
no affection for <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> he thought ſit to make his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
thereof, and had then diſcovered himſelf to us to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:97242:118"/>
my aſſiſtance upon the opinion he had of my gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity.</p>
                        <p>Thus did <hi>Teramenes</hi> give us an account of his adventure,
and prevailed ſo far with <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> that ſhe pardoned <hi>Pelorus,</hi>
who in thoſe tranſactions had expreſſed a greater love to his
ancient Maſter then to his new Miſtreſſe. But to what purpoſe
ſhould I ſpin out the particulars of this relation, all things were
compoſed, quiet and ſerenity of thoughts began to chaſe away all
former diſſatisfactions, onely <hi>Eurinoe</hi> diſcovered by certain ſighs
that her ſoul was not abſolutely recovered, and, three daies after,
finding my ſelf in a condition to depart thence, I charged
<hi>Eurinoe</hi> with her promiſe, and in my preſence obliged her
to marry <hi>Teramenes.</hi> There happened ſome particulars in this
action which I carefully concealed from <hi>Teramenes,</hi> and the
next day I preſſed them, to accommodate me with thoſe
things that were neceſſary for my departure, that I might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
to thoſe places which I was obliged to go to, promiſing
them, I ſhould acknowledge, when it ſhould pleaſe the gods to
enable me, the aſſiſtances and kindneſſe I had received from
the officions <hi>Eurinoe. Teramenes</hi> granted my requeſt, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
us with cloaths, arms, and horſes, and would have gone
along with me, had I accepted of his company: but I gave him
thanks for his kind proſſers, and told him, that I was ſatisfied
he ſhould be no longer my enemy, without engaging him to
be any way ſerviceable to me againſt <hi>Tiribaſus,</hi> who was
much his friend, and ſo intreated him not to diſcover any thing
he knew of me, and to promote the report which was already
ſpread abroad of my death. And this I was the more confident he
would do, not onely upon the promiſe he had made to do it,
but alſo out of a conſideration of his own intereſt, which would
adviſe him not to publiſh a thing, that might exaſperate <hi>Tiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſus</hi>
againſt him. They alſo taught me an invention which
proved very fortunate to me; for, perceiving I was ſomewhat
troubled how to conceal my ſelf in the places I was to paſſe
through, by reaſon of the fairneſſe of my face, ſo different from
the complexion of the men of that Country, they gave me
a certain water, which is commonly uſed among the <hi>Aethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opians,</hi>
by thoſe that are deſirous of a more ſhining black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in the countenance, and having made experience of it
firſt on my hands, they afterwards therewith painted my
face, as alſo that of <hi>Eteocles,</hi> ſo that after three waſhings,
we were growne as blacſh as if we had really been <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians.</hi>
They gave me a little Glaſſe Bottle full of it, to
carrie along with me, and ſhewed me the way to take it
off, when I had a mind to do it, which was, onely with
warm water and certain herbs put into it. In this poſture,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:97242:118"/>
after ſome bemoanings from <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> which ſhe was not
able to forbear, and thouſands of proteſtations which I
made her, to acknowledge her extraordinary favours,
if ever Fortune proved kind to me, I departed from
that houſe without any other company then that of <hi>Ete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocles,</hi>
and one ſervant on horſeback, <hi>Teramenes</hi> beſtowed
on me, and of whoſe fidelity he gave me very great aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances.</p>
                        <p>The deſigne I then had was ſecretlie to get to thoſe
whom I knew to be ſtill my Friends, and were deſirous to
ſerve their Princeſſe, and had a zeale for the memory of
their late King, hoping, that upon my returne they would
be encouraged to attempt ſomething for the ſervice of their
Queen, whom I knew to be well beloved among the <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opians.</hi>
Among thoſe <hi>Telemachus</hi> and <hi>Oriſthenes</hi> were the
moſt conſiderable, and, having underſtood in my way
that they were retired from the Court to certain houſes
they had in the Countrie, where they paſſed away their
time in griefe and ſolitude, I, without any danger, got
to <hi>Oriſthenes,</hi> paſſing through all places, without the leaſt
ſuſpicion, by reaſon of the blackneſſe of my countenance,
which diſguiſed me ſo well, that you your ſelf, Madam,
were miſtaken in me. I ſhall not take occaſion to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
my diſcourſe upon the aſtoniſhment of <hi>Oriſthenes</hi> and
<hi>Telemachus,</hi> when I had diſcovered my ſelfe to them, and
when they found me living after they had bewailed my
death. They gave me thouſand of expreſſions of their joy
and friendſhips, and continuing ſtill as well affected and as
zealous for the ſervice of their Queen, as ever they had
been; they very cheerfully entertained the propoſition I
made to them, of attempting ſomething againſt the Tyrant,
and proffered of themſelves to go, and ſecretly ſollicit
all her faithfull Servants and Subjects into ſome engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and to get together ſuch a Body as might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
ſome remarkable enterprize. They acquainted me,
Madame, how you had been ſecured and guarded; and
gave me an account of your admirable conſtancy in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
the ſollicitations of <hi>Tiribaſus,</hi> who was not yet
come to the utmoſt violences, but had gone ſo far as
to put your moſt faithfull Servants into ſome feare, that he
would not long continue in thoſe termes. I communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to them the deſigne I had to waite on you, and
they were perſwaded, that, conſidering how I had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed
my ſelfe, I might come even into the preſence
of <hi>Tiribaſus</hi> without any danger. I came to <hi>Meroe,</hi> where
I had not the happineſſe to ſee you the firſt time; but
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:97242:119"/>
the ſecond, when I came into the Garden, I was more
fortunate, and ſeeing you again, I laid as an offering at your
feet your faithful <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> whom you had honoured with
your tears, and who, through the exceſſe of your goodneſſe
and favours, ſtill lives in your memory.</p>

THe fair Princeſſe of the <hi>Parthians</hi> and the Queen
of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> had hearkened hitherto with great
attention to the relation of <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> without
offering to interrupt him, but when he was come
to that paſſage, <hi>Eliſa,</hi> looking on the Queen with
a ſmiling countenance; <q>You were very much to
blame, Madam, <hi>ſaid ſhe to her,</hi> not to have diſcovered to me
this particular of <hi>Caeſario's</hi> life, becauſe, in my judgement it is
none of the leaſt important. But I withall perceive that you
purpoſely avoided all occaſion of giving me any account of the
Love of <hi>Eurinoe,</hi> out of a fear you were in, that I might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
in your diſcourſe, ſome glimpſes of the jealouſie you may
have conceived at that adventure.</q> 
                        <q>You force me to a proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Madam, <hi>replied the Queen (with an action wherein ſhe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be as indifferent and as little earneſt as the other</hi>)
which is, that the greateſt part of thoſe things which he hath
related, was not come into my knowledge; and therefore whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were for the reaſon you alledge, or for ſome other yet
unknown to me, <hi>Caeſario</hi> had given me but an imperfect account
of that adventure, and had not diſcovered the particulars
thereof that were of moſt conſequence.</q> You are very much
in the right, Madam, <hi>replies Caeſario,</hi> for indeed, I ſhould glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have avoided giving you any account of it, could I well have
done it, and the little inclination I have to engage my ſelf in a
diſcourſe of this nature might have exempted me from doing
it now, had you not laid your abſolute commands upon me to
that purpoſe. I have therefore made a ſhift to get through the
firſt and longeſt part of my narration, ſince you have already
acquainted this great Princeſſe with the entertainments that
paſſed between us in the garden, as alſo all that happened even
to the day, on which, after I had brought in four thouſand
men of thoſe I had drawn in to our party by the means of <hi>Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus</hi>
and <hi>Oriſthenes,</hi> I forced the palace, and that <hi>Tiribaſus,</hi>
having ſaved himſelf by getting into the Citie, I led you through
the garden to a veſſell which I had provided to carry you along
the <hi>Nile</hi> to the cittie of <hi>Baſſa,</hi> a place then at our devotion. Of
all theſe things, <hi>replied the Queen,</hi> I have given the Princeſſe an
exact account, all you have yet to inform us of, is, what hath
happened to you ſince our ſeparation. Though this, replied
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:97242:121"/>
                        <hi>Caeſario,</hi> be the ſhorteſt part of my relation, yet is it that of
greateſt conſequence, and I cannot but extreamly wonder you
ſhould not be more impatient to know whether you have not ſtill
a Crown to diſpoſe of.</p>
                     <p>After I had brought you to the veſſell, and there left you,
though not without much violence to my ſelf; to put the deſigne
we had undertaken in execution, which we had in ſome part effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
in as much as concerned your liberty, but as to what was yet
to be done were in a very ill poſture by reaſon of the eſcape of
<hi>Tiribaſus,</hi> I returned to the palace, where I found all my men
abſolutely reſolved to make good what they had gotten, and to
fight for your intereſt to the laſt gaſpe. I encouraged them in
that deſigne by all the words I thought might any way animate
them, and put them into a poſture of maintaining the Palace, in
the beſt order I poſſibly could. I made no doubt but that <hi>Tiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſus,</hi>
as being a man much experienced in matters of war, would
come immediately and ſet upon us with all the force he could of
a ſudden make, knowing that it concerned his ſafety to recover
preſently what he had loſt, before thoſe ſupplies came in to us
which we expected. This he accordingly put in execution, as I
had imagined he would, and he was no ſooner gotten into the
City, but he forced all the Citizens to take up armes, though the
main motive of their obedience was their fear, their inclinations
being abſolutely for their Queen; and in the mean time having
given order that all the troops that were in the ſuburbs and about
the Citie, ſhould rally under the command of <hi>Theogenes</hi> and
<hi>Aſanor,</hi> he got a conſiderable body together, and came againſt
the Palace with abundance of fury. You know, your ſelf, Madam,
that all the fortification there is about it, is a ditch with a low
ſtone-wall flanked here and there with certain Towers. The
ditch may ſoon be filled, as being neither very broad nor very
deep, yet not ſo eaſily but that it would coſt a great many men to
do it, the palace being made good by a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of men, and thoſe all reſolved to ſell their lives at the deareſt
rate.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tiribaſus</hi> having made his aſſaults upon that ſide of the palace
which lies towards the City, ſent at the ſame time to ſecure all
the boats that were upon the <hi>Nile,</hi> that he might not onely have
the command of the river to carry on the ſiege againſt us, but alſo
prevent us from making any eſcape that way. Nay I doubt not
but that, if he had had the leaſt ſuſpicion of your departure, he
would have ſent ſome boats after you; but you might have been
ſo far before he bethought him of that courſe, that I was out of
all fear of your being taken before your arrivall at the City of
<hi>Baſſa,</hi> where you were expected. <hi>Tiribaſus</hi> made his approaches
and carried on the aſſault, as a man that very well knew what
he had to do; and cauſing ſome part of his ſouldiers to bring turfs,
ſtones, faggots, and all ſuch other things as were fit to fill up the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:97242:121"/>
ditch, he began to do it with abundance of earneſtneſſe, but there
being within a conſiderable number of old ſoldiers, and ſuch as
were well verſed in matters of war, and far greater then was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for the defence of the palace, while I gave order that
ſome ſhould reſt themſelves, the reſt were diſpoſed upon the
battlements, and ſhowering down arrowes upon the Stormers
that were below, they filled the ditch much more than all thoſe
other things did which the enemy had brought thither to that
purpoſe. I had, as good fortune would have it, found out in
the palace, an infinite number of arrowes and all other armes,
which it ſeems <hi>Tiribaſus</hi> had cauſed to be brought in thither, and
which was yet a further happineſſe going into that chamber
which he had appropriated to himſelf ſince his pretended Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
I there met with my own armour enriched with Eagles of
gold, the very ſame which I had been ſtripped of after the battle,
and which had been brought to him, as well for their ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
as to put him into a greater aſſurance of my death. I
have been informed ſince that it was an officer that had fought
under my command in the war of <hi>Nubia,</hi> and one that had
ſome reſpects for me, that had hindred his companions from cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off my head, to preſent it to <hi>Tiribaſus,</hi> as they were once
reſolved to do, and was content onely to ſtrip me of my Armour
and to preſent him with them. This accident I looked on as a
good omen, and thereupon putting them on with much joy, I
imagined my ſelf more hardly conquerable in them than I had
been before. I very diligently viſited all thoſe places wherein my
preſence might be any way ſerviceable, and omitted nothing that
contributed ought to our defence, no more then <hi>Tiribaſus</hi> did
on the other ſide to carry on the aſſault. I once perceived him,
amidſt a many of his Soldiers, iſſuing out his orders with much
earneſtneſſe, and having diſcovered my ſelf to him by a great
ſhout, I took a bow and arrowes in my hand, and ſhot twice at
him, the latter arrow coming ſo near his head, that he durſt not
continue any longer in the place where he was; and perceiving
that, at the ſame time, I cauſed him to be ſhot at ſeverall
waies, after he had threatned me by cries and geſtures, he retired
to a place where he was more ſecure. From that time I ſet upon
him the beſt Archers I had, to ſhoot continually at him aſſoon as
ever he ſhould appear, by which means it came to paſſe that he
was leſſe confident in the aſſault then he had ſhown himſelf
before.</p>
                     <p>The number of men that I had within the palace was ſuch,
that I might have ventured to ſally out, and have forced back
the more daring of the Enemies ſide; but it was my greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
to gain time, in expectation of thoſe ſupplies which
<hi>Oriſthenes</hi> was to bring me, and which were raiſed with ſo much
privacy, in the Cities that were ſtill under our command, that
<hi>Tiribaſus</hi> had not the leaſt intelligence thereof, and in the mean
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:97242:122"/>
time to keep <hi>Tiribaſus</hi> ſo in play, that, directing all his force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us, he might make the leſſe proviſion againſt other ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
Beſides thoſe I had about me in the palace I had four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
men lying dormant in the Citie, in certain houſes whereof we
were confident, and under the command of <hi>Clinias</hi> a Nephew of
<hi>Oriſthenes;</hi> and theſe were ordered, aſſoon as the ſupplies were
come, to joyne with them at a place appointed, and poſſeſſe
themſelves of a gate of the City to make way for the other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
I diſcovered ſome part of my deſigne to the principall Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
encouraging them to play the men that day, and promiſing
them they ſhould be relieved, if not the night following, at
fartheſt the next morning. There was no great need of this ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation,
for they all fought with ſuch eagerneſſe, that, though
<hi>Tiribaſus</hi> had in ſome places filled up the ditch, and had brought
ſealing ladders to ſtorme the place, yet all came to no other
effect then that thoſe who were moſt forward to get up, were rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
down into the ditch, as it were to abate the confidence of thoſe
that were to come after them.</p>
                     <p>You would haply think my relation very tedious and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
ſhould I give you a particular account of all the actions
of that day, and therefore, I ſhall think it ſufficient to tell you,
that the Gods (who no doubt, had a vengeance in ſtore for the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
of <hi>Tiribaſus,</hi>) took away the light of his reaſon in that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergency,
and, depriving him of ſome part of his ordinary pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
were pleaſed, that, blinded by the violence he was in to
reduce us, he bent all his forces to do it, in ſuch manner, that he
made not any proviſion for the ſecurity of the City. Upon this
account was it that he ſpent the whole day in aſſaults againſt us,
but to no purpoſe, and having hardly taken one houres reſt in the
night, he was at us again before day, much more furiouſly then
before.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>Oriſthenes,</hi> having landed in the Iſland with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any difficulty, was, with the advantage of the night, gotten
to the very gates of <hi>Meroe,</hi> and, at the break of day, having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the ſignall which we were agreed upon with <hi>Clinias,</hi> he was
preſently at the gate, whither all his men, coming to him from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
quarters, came about him, and, before that thoſe who were
then upon the guard could perceive whether they were Friends
or Enemies, they fell upon them, cut off thoſe that made any
reſiſtance, and having forced the reſt to fly, ſet open the gate
for <hi>Oriſthenes.</hi> Yet could not this be done with ſo little noiſe,
but that thoſe who were upon the walls, though but few, and
thoſe not much minding what was done, did, aſſoon as it was
light, diſcover the forces of <hi>Oriſthenes,</hi> and accordingly give the
alarme; but, before it could come to the place where <hi>Tiribaſus</hi>
was, <hi>Oriſthenes</hi> was gotten into the City, his troops coming in
ſtill like waves, and meeting with nothing that any way oppoſed
them. He brought in along with him three thouſand horſe, and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:97242:122"/>
about ſeven or eight thouſand foot, all choice men, and ſuch as
were ready to ſacrifice their lives for the juſt cauſe wherein they
were engaged. <hi>Oriſthenes</hi> uſed all the expedition he could to
get in his forces, which he diſpoſed into the more ſpacious ſtreets
and other large places that ly neer that gate, and when he ſaw
that the greateſt part were come in, and that the reſt would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
without any hindrance, he advanced towards the palace, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
all to the ſword that he met with in armes. He cauſed it to
be cried wherever he came that the Citizens ſhould lay down
their armes, and that no violence ſhould be done to thoſe that
would not fight for <hi>Tiribaſus.</hi> It were impoſſible for me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
to you what a diſtraction <hi>Tiribaſus</hi> was in, when word was
brought of that misfortune, and what imprecations he made
againſt heaven, when he perceived himſelf ſurprized by thoſe
very enemies, whom not long before he had ſlighted for their
weakeneſſe: and yet he withall ſaw that he had but little time
to looſe in conſultation, and that inſtead of carrying on the aſſault
againſt the palace, he muſt make head againſt <hi>Oriſthenes</hi> and fight
him.</p>
                     <p>He accordingly reſolved to do it, and thereupon, rallying all
the forces he had abont him, and giving order that his horſe
ſhould mount, he mounted alſo himſelf, and leaving a ſmall
number before the Palace to keep us in play, he took all the reſt
along with him to engage with <hi>Oriſthenes.</hi> I had underſtood by
a ſignall from <hi>Clinias</hi> that the ſupplies were come, and eaſily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
what might have followed, inſomuch, that, finding that I
might either freely ſally out, or at the worſt meet with ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
as I might well overcome, I thought it not fit to ſight any
longer behind dead walls; and ſo leaving twelve hundred men
to make good the Palace, though a leſſe number might have ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to do it, I commanded out all the reſt, and getting up of a
good horſe, whereof I found no ſmall number about the Palace,
and which I diſpoſed among the moſt conſiderable of thoſe that
were about me, I cauſed the great gate of the Palace to be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and drew out into a ſpacious place not far from it. Thoſe
that endeavoured to oppoſe our paſſage were immediately cut in
pieces, and the reſt, running away, made all the haſt they could to
<hi>Tiribaſus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I was no ſooner got into the City, but I cauſed it to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
every where, as <hi>Oriſthenes</hi> had done before, that the
Queen pardoned the Citizens, provided they laid down their
armes, and this, running from one to another, proved ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual,
that the greateſt part of the inhabitants took occaſion to
go home to their own houſes, by which means <hi>Tiribaſus</hi>'s
party became much weaker then it had been. However, the
number he had about him was far greater then that of our forces;
but he could not make any advantage of their number in the
ſtreets, where the engagement was not the ſame as it would have
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:97242:123"/>
been in an open field. <hi>Tiribaſus</hi> was already engaged with <hi>Oriſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
and upon the firſt encounter there was abundance of bloud
ſpilt on both ſides. As I was marching towards the place where I
thought to have found them, I met with <hi>Aſanor</hi> in my way, in the
head of a party which he was carrying to the relief of <hi>Tiribaſus.</hi>
I immediately charged him, and it happening that we met in a
ſpacious place, the engagement proved accordingly very hot
and bloudy. The ſucceſſe alſo for ſome time was very doubtful,
but at laſt victory declared her ſelf for the juſter cauſe, and,
<hi>Aſanor</hi> being killed, with the moſt conſiderable of thoſe that were
about him, the reſt ran away in diſorder towards the place where
<hi>Tiribaſus</hi> was fighting againſt <hi>Oriſthenes,</hi> and certainly there it
was, that bloud and blows were not ſpared, and that we had by
much the worſt end of the ſtaff. <hi>Tiribaſus</hi> fighting with his men
like one that had all at the ſtake, had charged <hi>Oriſihenes</hi> with
ſuch fury, that the braveſt of his men lay upon the ground, and he
himſelf, being unhorſed, diſputed the buſineſſe on foot with little
hope of victory, nay, it would not have been long ere he had loſt
his life, had not ſome of the beſt affected and ſtouteſt of his men
ſet themſelves before him, and relieved him with much eagerneſſe.
<hi>Tiribaſus,</hi> making all the advantage he could of that overture of
victory, forced his enemies to retreat, fighting them ſtill even into
the ſpacious place of <hi>Meroe.</hi> There it was that he thought to give
them an abſolute defeat, by reaſon of the advantage of the place,
and the diſtraction they were already in, when I, coming to their
relief another way, which I found free, got up to that place with
my Troop, and immediately crying out, <hi>Candace, Candace,</hi> and
thoſe that followed me, <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> we revived thoſe that were
ready to quit the field, and abated their confidence, who expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
nothing leſſe then victory. The preſence of the two chiefs
added very much to the bloodineſſe of the engagement, which
was upon my coming reaſſumed, and, having ſent ſome of my
men to relieve <hi>Oriſthenes,</hi> whoſe danger I had underſtood, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to meet with <hi>Tiribaſus,</hi> as knowing that in his perſon
conſiſted all the war. I took notice of the place where he was, and
he immediately knew me. I am eaſily perſwaded that it was not
his deſire to avoid fighting, being, by the acknowledgment of all,
a man valiant enough, and no leſſe concerned in my death then I
could be in his: but the moſt devoted to his intereſts that were
about him, ſetting themſelves before him, many were laid on the
ground that I was forced to diſpatch to come up to his perſon.
At laſt we came together, notwithſtanding the oppoſition of our
men, and running at him full of fury; <hi>The day is now come,</hi> Tyrant,
ſaid I to him, <hi>that thou muſt render up the Crown with thy own life
into the bargain.</hi> He made me ſome anſwer, which I could not
hear by reaſon of the noiſe, and the heat I was then in, and
received me with a reſolution not muſt different from what I
brought. But, being ever and anon hindred by our men, who came
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:97242:123"/>
in between us, and that eſpecially by his, who fell upon me on all
ſides, I grew the more eager to determine the difference, and that
was it had almoſt coſt me my life. I had made two blows at <hi>Tiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſus,</hi>
with ſuch good fortune, that they gave him two wounds,
whereupon he began to look on me as one that fought with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
confidence of victory, when my horſe, by reaſon of many
hurts he had received, fell down ſo of a ſudden, that I had much
ado to get my feet out of the ſtirrups, and to ſtand before <hi>Tiribaſus,</hi>
who taking me at that advantage, was upon the point of running
over me, I could not avoid the ſhock of his horſe, inſomuch that
he had almoſt overthrown me, but in that poſture leaning on my
own horſe that lay dead between my legs, with my left hand, I,
with my right, thruſt my ſword into the belly of his, ſo that when
he was coming at me, he felt him falling down under him. In
that interim I cloſed with him, to avoid the ſhock of his men, and
in that diſorder finding a place unarmed, I run him with my ſword
through the body.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tiribaſus</hi> ſtretched forth his arms as he was falling with his
horſe, but, in regard that I ſtood neer him, he very furiouſly caſt
himſelf on me, and, by his weight forcing me to the ground, he
fell upon me, as he breathed out his laſt, and faſtned on me in ſuch
a manner, that I found it no ſmall difficulty to get from under him,
all goared and covered with his bloud. The danger I was
in by reaſon of that diſadvantage, had been very great, had I not
been relieved by diverſe ſtout men, wo reſcued me from the rage
of <hi>Tiribaſus</hi>'s friends, and, notwithſtanding all they could do, got
me on horſeback again. This, Madam, was the fate of <hi>Tiribaſus,</hi>
the uſurper of your Dominions, and your precious Liberty, and
you may ſee in it how that the juſt gods decreed he ſhould
periſh by his hands, to whom, of all men, that revenge was
moſt due.</p>
                     <p>Upon his death, thoſe that were of his party were ſo loſt, as
to courage and reſolution, that the moſt eager in the cauſe could
hardly be gotten to fight much longer. When I ſaw the reſiſtance
they made was very weak, and that ſome were running away in
the ſtreets, caſting away their arms, I conſidered, Madam, that they
were your ſubjects, and thereupon, out of a deſire to ſpare their
bloud, I cryed, and cauſed it to be cried up and down, that if they
laid down their arms, the Queen would give them their lives, and
would forgive all that was paſt. Some particular friends of <hi>Tiriba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>
would not accept of this proffer, but would needs be killed, and,
among the reſt, <hi>Eurinoe's</hi> Brother, whoſe life I would gladly have
ſaved for his Siſters ſake: but all the reſt, perceiving there was no
ſafety but by that means, and having, for the moſt part, ſided with
<hi>Tiribaſus,</hi> purely out of fear, laid down their arms, and cried up
and down, <hi>God ſave Queen Candace.</hi> I immediately thereupon
ſent orders every where, that none ſhould be put to the ſword; and
it was ſo religiouſly obſerved, that, after ſome few minutes, there
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:97242:124"/>
was no more bloud ſpilt. All thoſe of <hi>Tiribaſus</hi>'s party went in
among the Citizens, who had laid down their arms as ſoon as I
was gotten out of the Palace: and our men, though in arms and
victorious, began to treat the others as their Country-men and
companions. <hi>Oriſthenes,</hi> who, having been ſet on horſeback again
by the relief which I had ſent him, had joined with me, and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
himſelf with abundance of valour, rid all about the City by
my order, and ſo appeaſed the remainders of the diſorder, that
when the dead bodies were removed out of the ſtreets, it could
hardly be imagined there had been any fight.</p>
                     <p>All things being thus compoſed, I ſent out orders, that the more
conſiderable of thoſe that had followed <hi>Tiribaſus,</hi> as well Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
as ſouldiers, ſhould come to me in one of the moſt ſpacious
places in the City, and, after I had entertained them with a diſcourſe
(which it were not fit to trouble you with a recital of) wherein,
having in, the firſt place, repreſented to them the greatneſſe of their
crime, I made them, in the next, apprehenſive of that of your
goodneſſe, who were gratiouſly pleaſed, even at a time that they
might be puniſhed with ſeverity, to pardon them ſo horrid an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
and forget all that was paſt; provided that for the future
they did thoſe things which were expected from them. And that
I exhorted them to do with a true remorſe, and to repair their
crime, by a fidelity as remarkable as their defection had been. All
the inhabitants anſwered me with cries and tears, and, pronouncing
your name on their knees, they called all the gods to witneſſe the
ſincerity of their intentions, and proteſted they had done nothing
againſt you, but by force, and out of the fear they were in of the
power of <hi>Tiribaſus.</hi> The ſouldery, for the moſt part, returned
me the ſame anſwer, ſo that after I had taken a new oath of
allegiance from them all in your name, I diſmiſſed the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi>
permitting all to follow their occaſions, and ſuch as had friends
dead, to bury them. I alſo gave way, that thoſe that pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a more particular affection to <hi>Tirabaſus,</hi> ſhould take away his
body in order to an honourable enterrement, as knowing, Madam,
your generoſity to be ſuch, as permits not your reſentments to go
beyond death. And thereupon, having my thoughts wholly taken
up with you, and yet not thinking it ſafe to leave <hi>Meroe</hi> that very
day, for fear of the accidents that might happen upon ſo ſudden
a revolution, I ſent <hi>Clinias</hi> Expreſſe to you, to give you an account
of all that had paſt, and to intreat you to remain at <hi>Baſſa</hi> till the
next day, at which time I ſhould have waited on you, bringing along
with me your people of <hi>Meroe,</hi> who were infinitely deſirous of your
returne.</p>
                     <p>Having gone ſo far, I ſpent all the reſt of the day, and ſome
part of the night in pacifying and compoſing all things, and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
the ſhortneſſe of the time, there was ſuch order taken,
that it was hardly perceiveable that there had been any revolt in
<hi>Ethiopia.</hi> But what grief it was to me, what diſtraction I was in,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:97242:124"/>
the gods onely know, the next day, when I found <hi>Clinias</hi> returned,
telling me, that you had been expected to no purpoſe at <hi>Baſſa,</hi>
whither you came not at all, and where there had not bin any thing
heard of you. Being extreamly troubled at this account of you,
I immediatelie left <hi>Meroe,</hi> having onely ſtaied ſo long as to leave
orders with <hi>Oriſthenes</hi> to take care of all things till your returne,
and, taking certain boats, and ſuch a number along with me, as I
thought fit, of thoſe I could beſt truſt, I made all the haſt I could
to <hi>Baſſa.</hi> There I ſoon met with the cruel confirmation of your
loſſe, and underſtood from thoſe that you had left to command
there in your abſence, that they had neither ſeen nor heard any
thing of you. Theſe unfortunate tidings raiſing the greateſt
diſtraction imaginable in my thoughts, put me to ſuch extremities,
as I had never been acquainted with before; and the violence of
my affliction taking away for ſome time the uſe of my reaſon, I
had much ado to forbear revenging my ſelf upon ſuch as had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
nothing to the misfortune. I did nothing the reſt of that
day, and all the next night, but wander up and down upon the
<hi>Nile,</hi> while thouſands of perſons were ſearching in other places to
the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>But all proving ineffectual, I thought it my beſt courſe to return
to <hi>Meroe,</hi> out of a conceit, that, without all queſtion, you had
been taken by ſome perſons that <hi>Tiribaſus</hi> had ſent after you, and
that, by ſecuring thoſe that were yet there, of the friends of
<hi>Tiribaſus,</hi> ſomething might be diſcovered, when there comes to
<hi>Baſſa</hi> an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Marchant ſhip, by which I underſtood, that as
they ſailed up the <hi>Nile,</hi> they had met with the Pirate <hi>Zenodorus,</hi>
with four ſhips, and had eſcaped being taken by him, by making
to land, which they were not far from, and that they had paſſed
ſo cloſe to him, by reaſon of the narrowneſſe of the River in that
place above any other, that they could eaſily perceive there were
ſome Ladies priſoners in his Veſſel, whereof they had ſeen ſome
upon the deck, and heard the cries of others ecchoing all over the
River; and that afterwards, coming further into the River, after
the Pirate was gone by, they met with abundance of carkaſes
ſloating, and found all the circumſtances of a great and bloudy
engagement. From this diſourſe, which the paſſion I was then
diſtracted by eaſily induced me to believe, I immediately inferred,
all circumſtances conſidered, that it muſt needs be you, Madam,
that was fallen into the hands of the famous Pirate <hi>Zenodorus,</hi>
whoſe name was grown dreadful in all theſe coaſts, and who was
the beſt acquainted of any therewith, by reaſon of the perpetual
inroads that he made upon them. You may eaſily imagine, Madam,
that it were impoſſible for me to make you ſenſible of the grief
it was to me to hear theſe fatal tidings, and that all I am able to ſay
will come very far ſhort of what I then felt upon the firſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of that cruel account of our malicious Fortune. This
was it that put me out of all patience, and in a manner took away
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:97242:125"/>
the uſe of my reaſon, inſomuch, that the gods may well pardon
me, if, during the time that that extravagance laſted, I did not
alwaies obſerve that reſpect which a man ſhould never be guilty
of any breach of towards them. Nay, me thought the age I was
then poſſeſſed by, was in ſome ſort excuſable, and that misfortune,
happening at a time when I expected all the kindneſſe and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of fortune, ſeemed to me ſo great, that I could not imagine
it ſupportable by the greateſt conſtancy in the World. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
thinking it too great a lowneſſe of ſpirit to looſe time in
lamentations and fruitleſſe complaints, I ſent <hi>Clinias</hi> back, again to
<hi>Meroe,</hi> with orders directed to <hi>Oriſthenes,</hi> to hearken out every
where after you, in caſe the tidings I had received of you ſhould
prove falſe, and to ſecure the moſt intimate friends of <hi>Tiribaſus,</hi>
to find out, by that means, whether you had been taken by any
orders of his, and, having given him that charge, I took up three
veſſels that lay in the haven ready to ſet ſail, accompanied by all
thoſe I had about me, that I thought able to fight, and made all
the ſpeed I could towards the mouth of the <hi>Nile,</hi> into the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean</hi>
Sea. I thought it no ſuch difficulty to make after
<hi>Zenodorus,</hi> though with a number of veſſels, much inferiour to
his, and, no doubt, leſſe ſerviceable as to matter of engagement, and
all the fear I was in, was, that I ſhould not find him, ſo far was I
from any thoughts of being worſted, if I were ſo fortunate as to
meet with him.</p>
                     <p>We got out of the <hi>Nile,</hi> and were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>tred into the ſea, being
abſolutely to ſeek what courſe we ſhould take; but, having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
that <hi>Zenodorus</hi> came, often to <hi>Pelenſia,</hi> and the ports
adjoining to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to ſell ſome part of what he took upon
thoſe coaſts, I imagined I might there hear of him, and ſo thought
fit to make towards <hi>Alexandria.</hi> I ſhall not, Madam, trouble you
with the complaints I made during the time of this ſad courſe, nor
the doleful reflections which tormented my thoughts without the
leaſt intermiſſion. I was ſenſible, as indeed I ought to have been,
of a misfortune that deprived me of the happines of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;
but this was not yet the greateſt of my afflictions, and
when I imagined to my ſelf, that my faireſt Queen was in the
hands of a mercileſſe Pirate, and repreſented to my ſelf all the
dangers whereto ſhe might be expoſed, (and to which, as I have
ſince underſtood from <hi>Eteocles,</hi> it was but indeed too too true that
ſhe was) I was at a loſſe of all patience, inſomuch that I could
hardly forbear caſting my ſelf into the ſea. At laſt, we were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the ſame tempeſt which proved ſo favourable to you
againſt the inſolencies of <hi>Zenodorus,</hi> and which hath been the
occaſion of ſo many accidents upon theſe coaſts at the ſame time;
and this alſo grew ſo implacable to us, that our veilels were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed,
in ſuch manner, that I could never yet learn any tidings of
the other two, and know not but that they are long ſince devoured
by the waves: and that wherein I was in my ſelf, after we had,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:97242:125"/>
for two whole daies ſtrugled with the ſame cruelty of weather,
that you had met with, was at length caſt upon this coaſt within
a hundred Stadia of this City, ſo ſhattered, that it was abſolutely
unfit for the ſea. I left ſome part of my men to get the veſſell
repaired, as at <hi>Alexandria</hi> they might with all freedome do, there
being free commerce between the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians,</hi>
leaving orders with them that they ſhould expect to hear from
me in the port of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and that they ſhould make enquiry
every where after the Pirate <hi>Zenodorus.</hi> And ſo, taking onely
twelve along with me, proportionably to the number of horſes
that we had in the veſſell, we all mounted, and having, for ſome
time rid all together along the ſhore, I thought it not amiſſe that
we divided into parties, it being the more likely way to find out
what we ſought, and thereupon ſhewing them a little village
which I knew, and whereof I gave them the name, I entreated
them, that, after they had viſited all the places about <hi>Alexandria</hi>
they would all meet there at night.</p>
                     <p>This was done as it had been reſolved, and for my part I would
have no more in my company but onely one Eſquire, by reaſon of
the averſion, which, through melancholy, I had for all company.
All that day was ſpent in a fruitleſſe ſearch, and at night meeting
at the rendez-vous appointed, we there paſſed it over, wanting
nothing as to the accommodation of the body, if the mind could
have taken any reſt. The next day, I named to them another
ſmall town diſtant from this place about two hundred Stadia,
where was appointed the meeting for the night following, and
ſo, dividing into ſeverall parties, as the day before, directing them
to take other courſes then they had done, went my ſelf as
before, attended onely by a ſingle perſon in the qualitie of an
Eſquire.</p>
                     <p>I had wandred up and down for ſome part of the day, when,
finding my ſelf ſweltred with heat, and the weight of my Armour,
which I had not put off all this time, I would needs take a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
reſt, and refreſh my ſelf at a ſpring that lay in my way in the
midſt of a very pleaſant valley. With this reſolution I alighted
at a certain diſtance from the ſpring, and, having given my horſe
to the Eſquire, I ſate down by it, and putting up the viſour of my
head-piece, I drunk of the water, and lay down on the graſſe,
where no doubt I had taken ſome little reſt, had my grief been ſo
ſupportable as to afford me ſuch an intervall. I had not been there
many minutes, when there comes to the place where I was, a man
accoutred much after the ſame rate that I was, and, as I conceive,
with the ſame intention. His armes were very ſumptuous, and
he was of a goodly preſence: but I thought him quite another
man, when he had put up the viſour of his helmet, as I had, and
that, caſting my eies on his face, I found he had the beſt counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
in the world? We ſaluted one another very reſpectfully,
though that in his face, as well as mine, were viſible the characters
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:97242:126"/>
of more than ordinary ſadneſſe. After he had quenched his
thirſt, which it ſeems had forced him thither, he began to look
more earneſtly on me, and he had no ſooner caſt his eie on my
face but he thought he ſhould know me. His behaviour obliging
me to look on him with the like earneſtneſſe, methought the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments
of his face were not ſtrange to me, and, notwithſtanding
the alteration which ſeven or eight yeares might have wrought
therein, I preſently was perſwaded I had ſeen him ſomewhere
before.</p>
                     <p>We looked thus one upon the other, with ſome ſuſpence on
both ſides, when he, firſt diſcovering himſelf, and speaking to me
with an accent which I was not unacquainted with; <hi>I know not,
ſaid he to me, whether you would find</hi> Britomarus <hi>in my countenance
as I would do</hi> Cleomedon <hi>in yours.</hi> There needed no more than
theſe words to put me out of all doubt, that it was no other
then the ſame audacious <hi>Britomarus,</hi> with whom, while we were
yet both very young, I had had that great falling out in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi>
and whoſe valour and generoſity I had ſo much admired. And
though I ſhould have gladly concealed my ſelf from any other
perſon, yet could I not imagine it pardonable in me to do it from
<hi>Britomarus,</hi> after I had reflected on thoſe things that had paſſed
between us, and thereupon making him an anſwer ſuitably to his
manner of ſpeaking to me; <q>You are very much in the right,
<hi>ſaid I to him,</hi> I am <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> and though it is with much ado
that I called you to mind, yet now I am abſolutely ſatisfied that
you are <hi>Britomarus.</hi>
                        </q> 
                        <q>'Tis very true, I am <hi>Britomarus,</hi> replied
he, and I muſt tell you moreover, that I am <hi>Artaban.</hi> Under
this latter name I am much more known among men then under
the former; under that name I have gained ſome battles, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
Kingdomes for ungratefull Kings, and have done thoſe
actions, which have haply raiſed me to that rank, whereto I told
you at our laſt parting, I was in hopes to raiſe my ſelf. I have
meaſured my ſword with Kings, who have not thought it
any diſhonour to themſelves; I have raiſed ſome of them, I
have pulled down others, and I have not met with any greater
than my ſelf, till the chance of war had decided the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>There needed no more than the word <hi>Artaban,</hi> to ſatisfie me
as to ſome part of thoſe things which he told me, the reputation
of <hi>Artaban</hi> being ſo much ſpread all over the world, that few were
ignorant of the great actions he had done. On the other ſide, by
reaſon of the acquaintance there had been between me and <hi>Brito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marus,</hi>
I was eaſily perſwaded that he was <hi>Artaban,</hi> as finding in
him all things extreamly conformable to what I had known in the
other. I hearkened to his violent diſcourſe with much patience,
to ſee what would be the iſſue of it, when he, proceeding;
<q>I do not, <hi>ſaid he to me,</hi> tell you theſe things of my ſelf, <hi>Cleomedon</hi>
to derive any vain reputation thence, but to give you occaſion
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:97242:126"/>
to remember that, when I was affronted by you, and forced to
quit the ſervice of <hi>Candace</hi> for your ſake, I told you, as we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that a day might haply come, wherein I ſhould be in a
condition once more to meaſure a weapon with you. Not but
that the cauſe of that reſentment of mine hath long ſince been
taken away, and that the addreſſes which were ſlighted by
<hi>Candace,</hi> have Been entertained by a Princeſſe who is not inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
either to <hi>Candace</hi> or any other Princeſſe in the world; not
alſo but that I am ſatisfied that the averſion which I have ever
naturally had for you, is unreaſonable, ſince your excellent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
ought in all juſtice to gain you the eſteem of all the
world. On the other ſide, it is not unlikely, but that there may be
ſome occaſion, nay haply neceſſity, that both of us ſhould em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
our armes elſewhere, and upon that conſideration I ſhall
not oblige you to turn yours againſt me: but you will be pleaſed
to remember, when we ſhall meet with a more favourable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
that <hi>Britomarus</hi> is arrived to that condition

                     </p>
                     <p>This fiery diſcourſe of <hi>Artaban</hi>'s, though it raiſed in me a
certain eſteem for the perſon, yet was I not a little incenſed at,
and my thoughts being eaſily put into diſorder by reaſon of the
affliction I was in, there needed but a ſmall matter to put me out
of all patience. Not but that I was extreamly troubled at this
adventure, as ſuch as obliged me to a fruitleſſe engagement, in a
time which I was to employ in finding out other enemies; but
there being no grief ſo great as to ſmother the Love of glory, I
thought, that, the diſcourſe, which <hi>Britomarus</hi> had made, well
conſidered, I could not with honour avoid fighting, though he
had left it to my choice. Upon this reflection looking on him
with an eie, which eaſily diſcovered how much I was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at what he had ſaid; <q>Artaban, <hi>ſaid I to him,</hi> I am very
ready to believe of you all that you ſay of your ſelf, as alſo all
that Fame hath ſpread abroad concerning you, and am withall
ſatisfied, that the cauſe of your reſentments hath been taken
away by the change of your affections; but, it ſeems, though
there be no quarrell between us out of any conſideration of
jealouſie, I am yet to be accountable for your averſion, and
though there want not haply other occaſions of far greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
than the motives of our differences that call me elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
yet will I be obliged for my liberty to proſecute them,
to my ſelf and not to your civility. Let us not remit to another
time and other opportunities, what we may determine in this. It
is poſſible we may not meet with another ſo favourable, and we
were both equally blameable if we ſhould now part and avoid an
engagement that is now become neceſſary, and for which it
ſeems you come ſo well prepared.</q>

With theſe words I roſe up from the place where <hi>I</hi> lay, and
after I had put on and faſtened my head-piece, and taken my
buckler from my Eſquire, I got up on horſeback, and rid forth
into the moſt delightfull part of the plain. <hi>Artaban</hi> was not a
perſon to be expected, he had his foot in the ſtirrup aſſoon as my
ſelf, and being immediately, come up to me, he eaſily diſcovered
by all his deportment, that he was the perſon Fame publiſhed him
to be. The firſt ouſet proved very furious, and the indignation
I was in to think that he ſhould continue an unjuſt averſion during
ſo many yeares for a diſpleaſure I had innocently done him, and
for which <hi>I</hi> had made ſuch ſatisfaction, cauſed me to fight with no
leſſe animoſity againſt him, then I had done ſome few daies before
againſt <hi>Tiribaſus.</hi> The firſt blowes that were dealt on both ſides
were hearty and heavy enough; but being both very well ſkilled
in the uſe of the Buckler, there were a many exchanged ere there
was any wound received on either ſide. At laſt being more and
more exaſperated by this triall of our ſtrength, we engaged one
another with leſſe circumſpection, inſomuch that both his armour
and mine began to be dy'd with the blood, which our ſwords
drew out of our bodies. That ſpectacle heightning our courage
added alſo to our animoſity, and no doubt but that the end of
the combat would have proved fatall to one of us, nay it may be
to both, by reaſon of the great equality of our force, when a
certain man on horſeback riding at a ſmall diſtance from us, and
making a ſudden halt, ſtaied for ſome little time to look on us.
For my part, I could ſee nothing in the man that might divert me
from minding what I was then about: but <hi>Artaban</hi> had no ſooner
caſt his eie on him, but he gives a great ſhout, and at the ſame
time, gave me ſuch a blow over the head that I was for ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
ſtunn'd with it. However, I made a ſhift to recover and
that immediately, and was thinking to drive towards him, when,
looking about, I perceived him at a great diſtance from me, riding
with all the ſpeed his horſe could make, after the man we had
ſeen, and purſuing him ſo cloſely, that it was not long ere a tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that was in the plain deprived me of the ſight of him. This
accident put me very much to a loſſe, as being too well acquainted
with the valour of my Adverſary, to imagine that it was out of
any motive of fear that he avoided fighting. No, I was far from
conceiving any ſuch thing of him, as knowing him to be as gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
and as ſtout a man as ever drew ſword: but being already
exaſperated by the ſight of my blood ſliding down along my
Armour, I would needs run after him, either to decide our quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,
or know of him the reaſon why he had left me in the midſt
of it.</p>
                     <p>Whereupon obſerving the way he had taken, I followed the
track of his horſe, with all the ſpeed I could make, and within a
ſmall time came into a place where I found him engaged in a
combate with another man that ſeemed to be no leſſe valiant
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:97242:127"/>
then himſelf. But, my greateſt Queen, I ſhall ſay no more as to
what paſt then, becauſe you were your ſelf preſent and ſaw all,
having <hi>Eteocles</hi> with you, and another valiant perſon, who made
it his buſineſſe to part us. There it was that I had the happinneſſe
to ſee you like a flaſh of lightning, and juſt at the minute that I
began to feel the firſt motions of joy for that adventure, I ſaw
you carried away, once more, by the man whom <hi>Artaban</hi> had
purſued, who was returned thither with his companions, and
was the <hi>Pirate Zenodorus,</hi> as I have underſtood ſince by
<hi>Eteocles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fair Queen, who had been preſent at that action, and had
obſerved all till ſhe was carried away, was ſo well acquainted with
all paſſages, that he might well forbear all further account thereof.
Whereupon the Prince related to her, how that he had followed
her ſo long, till at laſt, through the great loſſe of bloud, and the
weakneſſe he was reduced to, by reaſon of his wounds he fell off
his horſe; how he had been relieved by <hi>Eteocles,</hi> and not long
after by his own Brother, Prince <hi>Alexander,</hi> and the Princeſſe
<hi>Artemiſa.</hi> He afterwards entertained her with an account how
they had brought him to the houſe where they had taken ſanctuary
themſelves; how that ſome few daies after, when he had in ſome
meaſure recovered his health, he had been acquainted with the
Hiſtory of their loves, and yet, though he had not the leaſt miſtruſt
of their vertue, and friendſhip, that he thought it not fit at that
time to diſcover himſelf to them, as not knowing whether ſhe
might take it well at his hands.</p>
                     <p>He afterwards acquainted her with the arrival of the Princeſſe
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and her being in that houſe, to whom alſo he had not
diſcovered himſelf, and how that the next day ſhe had been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away again with <hi>Artemiſa. Caeſario</hi> aggravated to the Queen
the affliction he conceived at that misfortune, as being not in a
capacity to afford his Siſter the aſſiſtances he ought, and to go
along with <hi>Alexander</hi> after thoſe that had carried her away; yet
told her withal, that it was his reſolution to have done it, and that
he would have put on his armour, if <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelf had not
prevented him; and if <hi>Eteocles</hi> had not taken ſuch order, that
he could get neither arms nor horſes for that day: that the next
day towards the evening finding himſelf a little ſtronger, he got
out of his bed with an intention at the ſame time to ſeek out both
<hi>Candace</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and was got to one of the windows,
whence, caſting his eye upon the adjoining wood, he had ſeen a
Chariot paſſing by, wherein he had perceived the Queen, with the
fair Princeſſe of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> whom he knew not, that upon
that happy ſight, joy taking its former place in his ſoul, friendſhip
had ſubmitted to love, and the loſſe of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> troubled him
the leſſe by reaſon of the recovery of <hi>Candace:</hi> That he would
immediately have run after her, but, not long after, <hi>Eteocles,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the room, and having communicated that good news to
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:97242:128"/>
him, had intreated him to have a little patience, and to give him
leave to run alone after the Chariot, to find out the truth of that
adventure; That accordingly <hi>Eteocles</hi> got on horſeback, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the track of the Chariot, and thoſe that conveyed it, into
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> whither having got in undiſcovered, he had informed
himſelf ſo well of all things, that he underſtood how the Queen
was in the Palace, with the Princeſſe of the <hi>Parthians;</hi> that ſhe
had been reſcued out of their hands that had carried her away by
the Praetor <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and that ſhe was attended with all manner
of reſpect, though ſhe had diſcovered her ſelf onely ſo far as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

ſhe was a Lady of great quality, born in <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> that theſe
tidings reſtoring him, as it were, to a new life, had alſo reſtored him,
in ſome meaſure, to his health and ſtrength: and that, having that
very day ſent <hi>Eteocles</hi> into the City to ſpeak with her, if he poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
with any convenience, could; he returned ſome time after,
with news, that he had ſeen her getting up into a Chariot, wherein
ſhe went out of the City, to take the air along the river ſide, and
would come within a ſmal diſtance of the houſe where he was;
That, upon that news he was not able to keep in any longer, and
that notwithſtanding the reaſons alledged by <hi>Eteocles,</hi> who would
by all means have hindred him, he got on horſeback, and rid for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

into the wood, in hopes of ſome opportunity to ſee her, out of a
confidence he ſhould not meet with any one that knew him. That
it was, as he croſſed the wood up and down upon that deſign,
that he firſt heard certain out-cries, and afterward ſaw the Prince<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Eliſa</hi> in the hands of <hi>Tigranes;</hi> That, though he knew not
who ſhe was, he had done her that ſervice which he ought
her, and that he had not forſaken her, had he not ſeen <hi>Artaban,</hi> and
a company of men on horſeback coming behind him; That being
unwilling to be diſcovered by them, he withdrew; but that he
had taken particular notice of <hi>Artaban,</hi> and that, looking on him
as the moſt concerned in the relief of the <hi>Princeſſe,</hi> he was very
glad that he had done him that good office, as wel out of a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the ſatisfaction a man takes in doing what he is in honour
obliged to, as out of a remembrance, that, in the engagement they
had had together, againſt the Pirate <hi>Zenodorus,</hi> and his men,
<hi>Artaban</hi> had relieved him, and helped him on horſeback, after his
own had been killed under him; That afterwards he had wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up and down the wood, in hopes to ſee the Queen, but that,
having obſerved ſome appearance of <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Cornelius,</hi> with
their Troop, he would not by any means be met with by them, and
thereupon retired till night, at which time, through the help of
the darkneſſe, he made a ſhift to get into the City, and, knowing
what part of the Palace the Queen was lodged in, he, without any
difficulty, found her out, having once gotten upon the terrace,
where he had met with <hi>Clitia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus did <hi>Caeſario</hi> put a period to his relation, and when he had
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:97242:128"/>
given over ſpeaking, the Queen, looking on him with a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
wherein her thoughts were in ſome meaſure legble; <q>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſario,
<hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> you have had your traverſes and extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and we had ours, which I ſhall not trouble you with any rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of, becauſe you have underſtood them already from <hi>Eteocles.</hi>
If I have ſuffered much for you, I muſt yet confeſſe you have
endured more for me, beſides, that by your attempts and valour,
you have regained me a Kingdom, which I gave over for loſt.
It is but juſt it ſhould be a preſent made to you, as it were, in
ſome ſort, to reward your care and conduct, and might it pleaſe
the gods I had any thing to preſent you with, that were more
conſiderable and more precious, that I might requite, as I ought
to do, thoſe ſo many noble demonſtrations of your affection.</q>
                        <q>Madam, <hi>replies Caeſario,</hi> it is beyond the merits of my blood,
nay, indeed, of my life, to deſerve the expreſſions I receive of
your favours and goodneſſe, and I am very much aſhamed to
expect ſo many great things from my nobleſt Queen, when I am
able to offer her nothing but a miſerable wretch diſcarded and
diſpoiled of that which now makes up ſo many Monarchies
and a............</q>

                     <p>
                        <q>Tis enough, <hi>ſaies</hi> Candace, <hi>interrupting him,</hi> let me hear no
more of that diſcourſe, if you have not a ſet purpoſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe
me, and take it for granted, that your perſon is of a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
high enough to be preferred by the greateſt Princeſſes in the

your Fathers Palace.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having by theſe words engaged him to ſilence, ſhe fell upon
ſome other diſcourſe, wherein ſhe diſcovered to him what trouble
ſhe was in for the danger whereto he expoſed himſelf, by coming
into <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where he muſt expect no leſſe then death if he
were once known; as alſo her diſpleaſure to ſee him ſo careleſſe
of his health, as being not ſufficiently recovered, (as might be
ſeen in his countenance) to venture on horſeback, and take ſuch
pains as he did. The Prince, after he had thanked her for the
afflictions ſhe was in for his ſake, as being the pure effects of the
tenderneſſe ſhe had for him; <q>For the hazard whereto I expoſe
my ſelf, <hi>ſaid he to her,</hi> it is not ſo great as you imagine it, and
beſides the difference there is between the face of a child of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years of age, and that of a man of four and twenty, the report
that is ſcattered up and down the world of my death hath taken
ſuch root, and is particularly ſo much credited by <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> that
it were no ſmall difficulty to perſwade people to the contrary:
and for my health, I find, that through the joy which the gods
have been pleaſed to afford me, by meeting with you again, I
have recovered my ſtrength in ſuch a meaſure, that within three
or four dayes I ſhall be in as good plight and condition as ever I
was, either to do any thing in point of arms, or to waite on you
by ſea into <hi>Ethiopia. Eteocles</hi> hath within theſe two daies found
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:97242:129"/>
out our veſſel, which the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> that had followed me have
gotten made fit for the ſea again, and rides at anchor within a
hundred ſtadia of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> Your faithful ſubjects that are
aboard it, have underſtood, not without great tranſports of joy,
that you were in this City, and expect your orders with that
ſecrecy which <hi>Eteocles</hi> hath engaged them to. I ſhall be content
to remain either with them, if you think it good, or in the houſe
where I have already made ſome abode, and where, by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
of <hi>Alexander,</hi> I have hitherto been extreamly well
entertained, and at ſuch houres as theſe you will give me leave
to wait on you for ſome ſmall time, till the day that you ſhall
have reſolved to depart hence.</q> 
                        <q>Alas! for matter of departure,
<hi>ſaies Candace to him,</hi> it ſhall be as ſoon as your recovery ſhall
permit, beſides that there are ſome other reaſons beſt known to
my ſelf, which would force me to haſten my departure hence,
were it not that the company of this fair Princeſſe, which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
without an infinite affliction ever quit, doth prevail with me
to wave all reſolutions of that nature.</q> 
                        <q>It was but juſt, <hi>ſaid
Eliſa to her,</hi> that you gave me that little comfort, after the cruel
diſcourſe you have entertained me with, and I ſhall be very
much troubled to conſent to your departure, if you do not take
me along with you.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe laſt words fell from her with a certain ſmile, whereupon
the Queen looking with a more ſerious countenance; <q>Faireſt
Princeſs, <hi>ſaid ſhe to her,</hi> you ſpeak that in jeaſt, which, with
more reaſon, you might do after another manner: and were it
the pleaſure of the gods, and that I might hope ſo much from
your friendſhip, as that, till ſuch time as you are reconciled to
the King your Father, or have ſetled your ſelf by other waies,
you would make your reſidence in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> you ſhall be there
attended with ſo much reſpect and affection, that poſſibly it
would be long ere you returned among the <hi>Parthiaus.</hi> Two
houres ſince I could not have made you this propoſition; but
ſince that through the aſſiſtances of the gods, and the valour and
conduct of <hi>Caeſario,</hi> we have recovered the Kingdom of our
Fathers, I ſhall never derive any advantage thence that can be
more acceptable to me then that which I may receive by this
goodneſſe of yours.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This diſcourſe of <hi>Candace</hi> was accented with ſo much affection,
that <hi>Eliſa</hi> could not forbear embracing her, and kiſſing her many
times together, giving her withal many thanks for this demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of her friendſhip, in terms wherein ſhe fully expreſſed how
extreamly ſenſible ſhe was thereof. At length, turning to <q>
                           <hi>Caeſario,</hi>
I ſhould have feared, <hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> that the difference there is
between you and <hi>Artaban</hi> might have engaged you to employ
the interreſt you have with the Queen, to oppoſe the ſanctuary
and entertainment ſhe is pleaſed to proſſer me, as knowing the
inclinations he hath for me, and haply having underſtood the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:97242:129"/>
marks of a more then ordinary eſteem which I have for him:
but ſince you have been ſo fortunately generous, as to have done
her, with joy, the greateſt ſervice ſhe could have expected from
the beſt of her friends, I cannot but hope, that, through the
aſſiſtance of the Queen, who will make it very much her buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to perſwade you thereto, you will not be ſo exaſperated
againſt him, as to deny him your frienſhip, if he deſires it of you,
as he is obliged to do.</q> 
                        <q>Madam, <hi>replies Caeſario,</hi> I can make an
unfained proteſtation to you, that I never had any hatred againſt
<hi>Artaban,</hi> and from the eſteem I have ever made of his admirable
endowments, it may eaſily be inferred, how extreamly I was
troubled to find in him ſo much averſion for me. Inſomuch,
that without engaging by this action, the Queen, or your ſelf, to
a belief that it proceeds from the reſpect and complyance I have
for your commands, I ſhall gladly embrace his friendſhip, and
give him what aſſurances of mine you ſhall think fit.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eliſa</hi> ſeemed to be extreamly joyd at this diſcourſe of
<hi>Caeſario's,</hi> whereupon the Queen, deſirous to unite thoſe two
extraordinary perſons by a friendſhip great as that which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
herſelf and <hi>Eliſa,</hi> knowing that <hi>Caeſario</hi> had had ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
account of the great actions of <hi>Artaban,</hi> as alſo of the
affection he had for <hi>Eliſa,</hi> acquainted him in few words with
what of moſt conſequence he was yet ignorant of. Inſomuch, that
by that relation ſhe gave him ſuch a character of <hi>Artaban,</hi> that he
looked upon him as the greateſt and moſt generous of men, and
repreſenting to him the difference there is between thoſe elevated
ſouls in whom noble actions raiſe onely an impreſſion of eſteem
and reſpect, and thoſe other reptile ones, wherein they produce
envy and enmity, to deſire with earneſtneſſe, the acquiſition of his
friendſhip.</p>
                     <p>It is not to be doubted but that the ſight of <hi>Caeſario</hi> was an
infinite ſatisfaction to <hi>Candace;</hi> and <hi>Caeſario,</hi> on the other ſide,
could gladly have ſpent whole ages in her company, and yet not
be ſenſible of their length; but yet, beſides the fear which upon
his account <hi>Candace</hi> was perpetually in, the night was in a manner
ſpent, and <hi>Caeſario</hi> thought it too great a preſumption to delay any
longer the repoſe of thoſe two great Princeſſes. So that he was
obliged to recommend them to their reſt, having firſt obtained
the Queens leave to waite on her the next night at the ſame hour,
and promiſed, that he would entertain <hi>Artaban</hi> with all friendly
embraces, if it ſhould prove his fortune ever to meet him again.
Aſſoon as he was gone, the two Princeſſes went to their beds, and
by reaſon of the alteration that had happened that day in their
fortunes, having diſmiſſed thoſe cruel diſturbances which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
their repoſe, thy fell into ſuch a quiet ſleep, that it was
very late the next day ere they awoke.</p>
                     <p>Thus was this night paſſed over by thoſe many illuſtrious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who were then at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and the next day aſſoon as
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:97242:130"/>
                        <hi>Olympia</hi> and <hi>Arſinoe</hi> had notice brought them, that <hi>Candace</hi> and
<hi>Eliſa</hi> were awake, they left their own lodgings with an intention
to give them a viſit, and to let <hi>Eliſa</hi> underſtand how much they
thought themſelves concerned in what had happened to her the
day before. They would by no means give way that <hi>Ariobarza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
and <hi>Philadelph</hi> ſhould follow them, though it was no ſmall
torment to them to be out of their Miſtreſſes preſence ſo much as
one minute, and indeed they were not over-earneſt to do it at
that time, knowing well, that by reaſon of the difference of ſex
they had not the ſame freedome with the others to viſit Ladies
before they were dreſſed. Beſides <hi>Philadelph</hi> was a little troubled
by what he had underſtood of the arrivall of <hi>Tigranes,</hi> and the
attempt he had made to carry away <hi>Eliſa.</hi> And being withall a
kinſman and friend to the King of the <hi>Medes,</hi> and that it was by
his aſſiſtance and that of <hi>Archelaus</hi> King of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> that <hi>Tigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
had recovered his Kingdome, he knew not well, how he ſhould
behave himſelf towards <hi>Eliſa,</hi> for whom he had already concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
abundance of reſpect, and for whom <hi>Arſinoe</hi> whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
he was wholly to be guided by, had a very great affection.
At laſt he reſolved not to do any thing that <hi>Arſinoe</hi> might take
amiſſe at his hands, or prejudice the reſpect he had for <hi>Eliſa;</hi> but
he thought he might ſafely go and ſee <hi>Tygranes,</hi> having underſtood
that he was in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and thereupon taking his leave of
<hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> for ſome time, he went to give him a viſit. And
yet before he was gotten out of doores he called to mind the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
enmity that was between the King of the <hi>Medes</hi> and the houſe
of <hi>Armenia,</hi> though there had been a peace concluded between
thoſe two Crownes by the intereſt and Authority of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi>
And accordingly, fearing that <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> was ſtill wedded to
the quarrell wherein his houſe had been engaged, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
an enemy to <hi>Tygranes,</hi> he entreated him for his ſake, to
moderate the reſentments there might be yet remaining in him as
to that affaire, and to do that Prince no ill office, if he did not
by ſome deportment of his, oblige him thereto. <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi>
who was a perſon of an excellent good nature, promiſed <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delph</hi>
to be guided in all things by him, and ſeeing himſelf depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of all company by his departure, he went to ſee <hi>Agrippa</hi>
whom he extreamly honoured for his vertue, and whoſe friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
he was very deſirous to preſerve that he might make uſe of
it, either upon his own account or <hi>Philadelphs,</hi> againſt
the implacable humour of <hi>Artaxus,</hi> whom he ſtood much in
fear of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tygranes</hi> had paſſed away the night in ſuch fits of madneſſe and
exaſperation, as had hardly allowed him the reſt of ſome few
minutes, and brought him into an humour, which made him unfit
company for all in a manner, <hi>Philadelph</hi> onely excepted. But
aſſoon as he caſt his eies on that Prince whom he had infinite love
for, and whom he was obliged to for the recovery of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:97242:130"/>
all his melancholy and extravagant reſentments vaniſhed to
make way for that exceſſe of joy which filled him at a ſight ſo
little expected. He found it ſome difficulty to imagine to himſelf
that it was really <hi>Philadelph;</hi> but when the Prince had by his
words and careſſes, confirmed what his eies durſt not eaſily decide,
the ſatisfaction it was to him proved an excellent remedy to
alleviate his diſcontents, and, ſuffering himſelf to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
poſſeſſed thereby, his behaviour towards the Prince
was ſuch as could not proceed but from a violent and cordiall
affection.</p>
                     <p>After the firſt complements, ordinary upon the occaſion of
ſuch an interview, were paſt, <hi>Tygranes</hi> aſked <hi>Philadelph</hi>
what ſtrange adventure had brought him to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and
<hi>Philadelph,</hi> having made the ſame demand to the other, they
reciprocally ſatisfied one the other; and entertained one
another with an account of their laſt adventures, by means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they were come to <hi>Alexandria. Tigranes</hi> ſeemed to be very
glad at the fortunate ſucceſſe of <hi>Philadelphs</hi> Love, though he
could not but much wonder, that that fair <hi>Delia,</hi> of whom he
had heard ſuch ſtrange things while they were in the wars toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
was the ſame <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> that was reported to be dead long
before with her Brother <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> and Siſter to <hi>Artaxus</hi> their
in econcileable enemy. <hi>Philadelph</hi> told him that he had been no
leſſe aſtoniſhed at it himſelf, and therefore doubted not but that
the indeprecability of <hi>Artaxus</hi> and that of the King his own Father
might yet put a many rubbs in their way; but, all notwithſtanding,
he thought himſelf happy in having conſecrated his life to the
moſt amiable and moſt vertuous Princeſſe upon earth, and that he
expected no leſſe from the friendſhip of <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> and the
authority of <hi>Caeſar</hi> then that all things ſhould be ſo carried that
both parties ſhould comply to contribute to their good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
                     <p>After they had had ſome diſcourſe of the affaires of <hi>Philadelph</hi>
they ſpoke of thoſe of <hi>Tigranes,</hi> and after that that violent King
had with a great deale of fury and fierceneſſe diſburthened him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of part of that which lay ſo heavy on his heart, and made
thouſands of complaints againſt <hi>Eliſa,</hi> and diſgorged thouſands
of menaces againſt <hi>Artaban</hi> and all thoſe that were of his party,
<hi>Philadelph</hi> took occaſion to reaſſume the diſcourſe with abundance
of mildneſſe in theſe termes. <q>You do not doubt, <hi>ſaid he to
Tigranes,</hi> but that I am your Friend, and as deeply engaged in
your intereſts as any Prince whatſoever, either of your allies
or neighbours.</q> 
                        <q>The expreſſions I have received thereof, are
but too many, too great and too important, <hi>replied Tigranes,</hi>
not to raiſe in me a confidence of your Friendſhip. Since you
are ſo much of that belief <hi>replies Philadelph,</hi> you will give me
leave to tell you that you your ſelf contribute moſt of any to
your own misfortunes, and that the ſame <hi>Eliſa</hi> for whoſe ſake
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:97242:131"/>
you have once already loſt your kingdome, may prove the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of greater inconveniences to you. I muſt needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the world affords not any thing comparable to her beauty,
not any thing greater than the rank ſhe is in among the Princeſſes
of the earth, and that the Crown of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> whereof
ſhe is yet preſumed to be the lawfull heir, is, next to the Roman
Empire, the greateſt Monarchy in the world. But on the other
ſide, yo are to conſider, that this <hi>Eliſa</hi> ſhunns you, hates you,
preferrs before you a perſon whoſe revenues conſiſt in his ſword,
and defies the indignation of her Father and her King, meerly
to ſatisfie the averſion ſhe hath for you; ſo that you may well
infer that there is little likelihood to reduce that which neither
paternal autority, nor the hazards ſhe hath hitherto been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to, have ineffectually attempted: And therefore, if you
will take my advice, you will make this advantage of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entertainment
of your addreſſes, to baniſh out of year heart
a perſon that ſlights you, and one that, though ſhe were within
your power, will never have any affection for you while ſhe lives,
and conſequently, muſt needs make you, by reaſon of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
hoſtility which you muſt ever expect to ſtruggle
with in your own houſe, the moſt unfortunate Prince upon
earth.</q>
                     </p>
                     <q>
                        <p>On the other ſide, I have heard of ſome little engagement
you were in towards <hi>Vrania,</hi> during the time you took ſanctuary
with King <hi>Archelaus,</hi> her Brother, who may with very much
reaſon be exaſperated againſt you, if the things I have heard
be true, and you muſt needs expect the reproaches of all
the world, if by your irregular proceedings you diſoblige
a friend from whom you have received ſervices of ſo great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>While <hi>Philadelph</hi> held him with this diſcourſe, <hi>Tigranes</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
to it with much impatience, as deſirous to interrupt him.
But when he had given over ſpeaking; <q>I muſt needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<hi>ſaid he to him,</hi> that there is abundance of reaſon in ſome
of theſe things which you inſiſt upon; but if you have had
as much love for <hi>Delia</hi> as you have ſometimes told me you had,
I am to learn, how you can imagine it ſhould be ſo eaſie for me
to diſengage my ſelf from that which I have for <hi>Eliſa,</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
of whoſe beauty are not ſo weak but that they may
work their effect upon a mans heart while he lives. Beſides,
though my inclinations that way proceeded not out of any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
of Love, and the intereſt of a Crown, ſuch as is
that of the <hi>Parthiuns,</hi> I am obliged to do what I do out of a
conſideration of honour; for I have married her by my Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours,
and the King her Father beſtowed her himſelf upon thoſe
Ambaſſadors, that ſhe might be brought into my embraces.
So that I am to take in any part of the earth, wherever I meet
with her, the woman that is my lawfull wife, and by all manner
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:97242:131"/>
of waies revenge the affront I have received, and I cannot
imagine that <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or any other Authority in the world, will
oppoſe ſo juſtifiable a reſolution. For <hi>Vrania,</hi> you know the
worſt ſhe can expect; it will be no prejudice to her to give place
to <hi>Eliſa,</hi> and though what you have heard ſhould prove true, ſhe
is no worſe dealt with by me then ſhe had been before by you.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>I hope you are not ſo far miſtaken, <hi>replies Philadelph,</hi> as to
imagine I ever promiſed <hi>Vrania</hi> any thing, and that if I had, the
Love I have for <hi>Arſinoe</hi> ſhould not oblige me to deceive her.
As for the revenge you ſpeak of, and which you ſay you ought
to endeavour for the affront hath been done you, I know not
on whom you ſhould execute it, and if you take my opinion,
I think it is onely of <hi>Eliſa</hi> that you have received that affront.
I ſhall not revenge my ſelf on <hi>Eliſa, replied the King of the
Medes,</hi> becauſe, notwithſtanding her ingratitude and inſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
towards me, ſhe is yet dearer to me than my own life, and
I could never attempt any thing againſt her, but it muſt wound
me to the heart. But I will puniſh that audacious fellow whom
ſhe moſt ſhamefully preferrs before me, and will chaſtiſe a perſon
who, riſen out of the duſt, would needs raiſe himſelf above
Kings, and who, not able to liſt himſelf up into the rank where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he now is, but by the favours that I have done him, and the
employments I have put him into in my Armies, hath ſo inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
abuſed the fortune he crept into by my lenity, and treats
Kings as his equalls, if not as his inferiours.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>I am not acquainted with <hi>Artaban, replies Philadelph,</hi> though
his great fame hath raiſed in me a great deſire to be; but if I
may meaſure him by the things I have heard related of him, I
cannot look on him as a perſon that Kings ſhould contemne.
This you can teſtifie more than any other, and conſequently
when I conſider the things he hath done as well for you, as for
the King of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> it cannot enter into my imagination
that you will find it ſo eaſie a matter to puniſh him as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Philadelph</hi> would have ſaid more to that purpoſe, as being not
able to forbear giving that acknowledgement of <hi>Artabans</hi> vertue
which all the world confeſſed to be its due; but obſerving in the
countenance of <hi>Tigranes,</hi> that he was not well pleaſed with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
of that nature, he thought fit not to continue it, and
not long after falling into ſome other talk, for ſome time,
they went together to give a viſit to <hi>Agrippa. Tigranes</hi> made
ſome difficulty to go, by reaſon of the hindrance he had done him
in his deſign the day before; but conſidering withal that, by reaſon
of the intereſt he had with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the ſucceſſe of his affaires depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
partly on him, he went along; <hi>Philadelph</hi> having before hand
made him promiſe, that he would not diſcover any diſſatisfaction
towards <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> who was no enemy of his, and had made the
ſame promiſe as to him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="258" facs="tcp:97242:132"/>
                        <hi>Agrippa</hi> entertained all theſe Princes with much civility, and,
being a man that derived no pride from the greatneſſe of his
fortune, becauſe it was indeed below his vertue, he treated them
with all the honour due to their dignity. And knowing that in
<hi>Alexandria</hi> they had not all things ſuitably to their rank, nor had
that attendance, they were wont to have, eſpecially <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi>
and <hi>Philadelph,</hi> who had not any retinue at all, he invited them to
dine with him, excuſing himſelf for being ſo free with them, out of
a reſpect of their preſent condition in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which was ſuch,
that they could not have thoſe accommodations at their own
lodgings, which they might with him. <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> and <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delph</hi>
were perſwaded to ſtay; but <hi>Tigranes</hi> would needs dine
with <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who had ſent him an invitation to that purpoſe
in the morning. At this firſt interwiew between <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> and
him, they ſaluted one another as perſons that were not acquainted,
without any expreſſion of diſcontent or animoſity of either ſide,
which was all that <hi>Philadelph</hi> deſired.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In the mean time</hi> Arſinoe <hi>and</hi> Olympia <hi>were gone to viſit</hi> Eliſa
<hi>and</hi> Candace, <hi>whom they took juſt getting out of bed, and aſſoon
as Olympia was gotten neer</hi> Eliſa, <hi>putting on, yet with a cheerful
look, the countenance of a ſlave;</hi> What, Madam, <hi>ſaid ſhe to her,</hi>
have you no employment now for your ſlave, and will you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

ſelf to be dreſſed, and receive the ſervices of thoſe that are about
you, and ſlight mine? Eliſa <hi>bluſhing at this diſcourſe, after ſhe had
kiſſed</hi> Arſinoe <hi>and</hi> Olympia; I cannot blame you, Madam, <hi>ſaid ſhe
to her,</hi> for reproaching me with the faults, which, through my
ignorance, I have committed againſt you; and to be ingenious, I
muſt confeſſe they are ſuch, that if you are not in ſome meaſure
guilty of them your ſelf, I ſhall be aſhamed of them as long as I
live.</p>
                     <p>This diſcourſe had been continued ſomewhat longer, if the fair
<hi>Arſinoe</hi> had not interrupted it, to let <hi>Eliſa</hi> know, how much ſhe
thought her ſelf concerned in what had happened to her, as
well upon her, meeting with <hi>Artaban,</hi> and with <hi>Tigranes,</hi> aſſuring
her, that ſhe was no leſſe troubled for any misfortune night come
to her, then thoſe perſons that had been of her acquaintance many
years together. The diſcourſe of <hi>Olympia</hi> was much to the ſame
effect, and that in terms full of affection; and when <hi>Eliſa</hi> had
returned them thanks, cloathed in the beſt expreſſions ſhe could,
<q>For your part, Madam, <hi>added ſhe, ſpeaking to Olympia,</hi> you have
done nothing upon this occaſion, but what I might juſtly have
expected from the friendſhip we have mutually promiſed one
another: but for yours, Madam, <hi>ſaid ſhe, directing her ſpeech to
Arſinoe,</hi> I muſt needs acknowledge my ſelf infinitely obliged
to you, for adhering to my intereſts, againſt your own friends,
or, at leaſt, if I may be pardoned that freedom, againſt thoſe of
<hi>Philadelph.</hi> For I cannot imagine you are ignorant, that <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delph,</hi>
is both a Kinſman and Friend to <hi>Tigranes,</hi> and that it was
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:97242:132"/>
                           <hi>Philadelph</hi> himſelf that raiſed him into that Throne, out of which
<hi>Artaban</hi> had pulled him down.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Since you oblige me to anſwer for <hi>Philadelph, replies</hi> Arſinoe,
<hi>ſmiling, and, and bluſhing at the ſame time,</hi> I ſhall tell you, that
haply he did but his duty when he relieved his friend and kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
againſt thoſe that had diſpoſſeſſed him of his dominions;
but if he place any concernment in the loſſe or enjoiment of
my perſon, I ſhall accordingly hope, that thoſe of our houſe
will be as dear to him, as any related to that of <hi>Tigranes,</hi> who
hath ever been an enemy thereto. And for our own particular,
I am to tell you, that there is ſuch a conſtancy in the inclinations
we both have to honour you, that I dare aſſure you that we
ſhall ever be of the ſame party. Beſides, I am further to let you
know that both my brother and he, though they never ſaw
<hi>Artaban,</hi> are ſo ſtrangely fallen in love with the noble fame he
hath acquired, and the account hath been given them of his
perſon, that it will be a kind of miracle that ever they ſhould
oppoſe him in any thing. Some conſidrations of no ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
have obliged them to forbear viſiting him this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but they hope, that ere this day be over, they ſhall find
out ſome means or other to ſee him: and if you will pardon
me the acknowledgment of my own curioſity, I muſt confeſſe,
that I deſire it no leſſe my ſelf, and that I cannot make any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation
of him to my ſelf, but as a very extraordinary
perſon.</q> 
                        <q>When you ſhall have ſeen him, <hi>added Candace,</hi> your
conviction will be much greater then your confidence is now,
and you will find, that though Fame be extreamly liberal of her
good word and character of him, all comes ſhort of the truth,
and in this diſcourſe which I make of him, I am the more to be
credited, the leſſe I am obliged to be his friend, and that, for
ſome little infidelity he hath been guilty of towards me, I
were ſufficiently diſpenſed from ſpeaking ſo much to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This laſt expreſſion falling from her with a ſmile, and that obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by <hi>Eliſa,</hi> onwhom ſhe looked at the ſame time; <q>I did not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
<hi>replied Eliſa,</hi> that you had been acquainted with <hi>Artaban,</hi> and
much leſſe that you could have charged him with any infidelity:
but I have this only to ſay by way of excuſe for him, that if he had
been guilty of it towards any other perſon then your ſelf, whoſe
attractions are ſo great, as to confine the moſt inconſtant minds
till death diſſolve them, I think I ſhould pardon ſuch a defection
out of a conſideration of the noble cauſe of his change, and that
I ſhould not call that man inconſtont that ſhould forget all things
to ſacrifice himſelf to the fair Princeſſe of the <hi>Parthians.</hi>
                        </q> 
                        <q>You
would take that for good ſatisfaction, <hi>ſaies Candace to her,</hi> if he
had forſaken you to ſerve her? I know not what I ſhould do in
that caſe, <hi>replied Arſinoe, ſmiling,</hi> but am ſatisfied, that I ought
to do it, if I were but any thing rational.</q>

heart, that <hi>Artaban,</hi> in whom you are not ſo much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
had ſeen you, had loved you, and had forſaken you, to court
<hi>Eliſa,</hi> and it would be no ſmall happineſſe to me to have ſo fair

                     <p>
                        <hi>Arſinoe</hi> was going to make her ſome reply, when <hi>Olympia</hi> takes
occaſion to break off the diſcourſe; out of a deſire to be more
particularly informed of the adventure that had happened the
day before; as having before had but an imperfect relation thereof.
<hi>Eliſa</hi> entertained them with an account of it; but, being unwilling
to bring in any thing into thoſe adventures relating to the Hiſtory
of <hi>Candace,</hi> which they had not been acquainted with, as they
had with her own, ſhe ſaid nothing of the diſcourſes that had
paſt between her and <hi>Artaban,</hi> and did not diſcover any thing
whence they might imagine that <hi>Artaban</hi> was <hi>Britomarus.</hi> Theſe
two Princeſſes were, by this relation, confirmed in the great opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they had conceived of him, and acknowledged that ſuch a man,
though without Crowns, was to be preferred before thoſe that wore

                     <p>When the Princeſſes were quite dreſſed, word was brought
them, that dinner ſtaid for them, and though <hi>Eliſa</hi> doubted not
but that ſhe ſhould ſee <hi>Artaban</hi> that afternoon, as ſhe had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him, yet out of a conceit that ſhe ſhould not any time that
day, have the freedome to ſee him alone, ſhe thought ſit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
the two Princeſſes to dine with them, which propoſition
they complied with, when they had underſtood by a meſſenger that
came from <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> to the Princeſſe his Siſter, that <hi>Philadelph</hi>

                     <p>Aſſoon as they had dined, they immediately returned into
<hi>Eliſa's</hi> chamber, whither they were hardly all gotten, but <hi>Cephiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi>
came and acquainted the Princeſſe, that <hi>Artaban</hi> was at the door
deſirous to waite on her. She, with a certain agitation which ſhe
was not able to conceal, gave order he ſhould come in, ſo that at
the name of <hi>Artaban, Arſinoe,</hi> and <hi>Olympia</hi> prepared themſelves
for a ſight which they had long been infinitely deſirous to ſee.
<hi>Artaban</hi> was immediately admitted, and came in with that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive
countenance, and majeſtick deportment, which raiſed in
all thoſe that ſaw him, reſpect and admiration. <hi>Olympia</hi> was aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
at it, as finding ſomewhat beyond all ſhe could have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
of him, and would needs turn to <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> as it were to
read her thoughts of him in her countenance, when ſhe obſerved
in it, more of aſtoniſhment and ſurpriſe then ſhe had thought to
find there. Accordingly, <hi>Artaban,</hi> having in the firſt place very
ſubmiſſively ſaluted <hi>Eliſa</hi> and <hi>Candace,</hi> had no ſooner turned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
towards <hi>Olympia</hi> and <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> to do them the ſame civility,
but the <hi>Armenian</hi> Princeſſe met with, in his countenance, that of
<hi>Britomarus,</hi> the ſame <hi>Britomarus</hi> that had courted her with a very
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:97242:133"/>
violent affection, in the King her Fathers Court, that <hi>Britomarus,</hi> whom, for his over-confidence, ſhe had ſlighted, though ſhe infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
eſteemed him for his great worth, and who, not long before,
had, in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> protected her againſt the violences of <hi>Antigenes,</hi>
and reſtored her into the hands of <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> after he had
delivered him out of the chains of the Pirates, as ſhe had related
to <hi>Philadelph</hi> two daies before. Theſe laſt obligations put upon
them by <hi>Britomarus</hi> were of ſuch conſequence, that in a mind, ſuch
as was that of <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> they could have produced no leſſe then
an acknowledgment equal thereto, and when that in the perſon of

Nor indeed either could ſhe, or would ſhe, diſſemble it,
and thereupon coming up to him with ſuch a confidence as ſhe
might have expreſſed towards a moſt affectionate brother: <hi>What,</hi>
Britomarus, ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>are you then that great</hi> Artaban, <hi>whoſe
fame fills the univerſe, and who, under that illuſtrious name of</hi>
Artaban, <hi>are pleaſed to conceal from us that of</hi> Britomarus, <hi>to
whom I ſtand engaged for my own honour, and my Brothers
life?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The other three Princeſſes could not but wonder very much at
this diſcourſe of <hi>Arſinoe;</hi> but indeed <hi>Artaban</hi> could do no leſſe
himſelf, as conſidering with himſelf, not without aſtoniſhment, how
Fortune, in ſo ſmal a ſpace of time, ſhould bring together, out of
ſeveral Kingdoms that lay at a great diſtance one from another, the
onely three perſons for whom he ever had conceived affection.
The preſence of <hi>Eliſa,</hi> as things then ſtood; put him into ſome
little diſorder, and yet not willing to be thought inſenſible of the
civility he had received from <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> for whom he had infinite
reſpects, after he had ſaluted her with as much ſubmiſſion as he
could have done, even when his affections were moſt violent for
her, <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>the ſame fortune, that makes</hi> Delia's <hi>and</hi>
Arſinoe's, <hi>may alſo make</hi> Artaban's <hi>and</hi> Britomarus's, <hi>and under both

nothing ſhall ever be able to make me forget.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Eliſa,</hi> during this diſcourſe, being gotten cloſe to <hi>Arſinoe:</hi>
                        <q>What, Madam, <hi>ſaid ſhe to her,</hi> it ſeems you are acquainted with
<hi>Artaban?</hi> Since <hi>Britomarus</hi> is the ſame with <hi>Artaban, replies
Arſinoe,</hi> I dare tell you, Madam, that I knew him before you, and
ſhal further let you know, that I have much reaſon to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with him, ſince that, not to mention the addreſſes he ſometime
made to me in my own Country, even while he was yet very
young, he hath within a ſmall time, by his admirable valour, and
with the hazard of his life, preſerved that, which, amongſt us,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:97242:134"/>
is counted moſt precious, and delivered my brother out of the
hands of the Pirates. What Siſter, cries out <hi>Olympia,</hi> is it than
to the great <hi>Artaban,</hi> that we are obliged for the ſafety of
<hi>Ariobarzanes?</hi>
                        </q> 
                        <q>It is ſo Siſter, <hi>replies Arſinoe,</hi> tis to him that we
are obliged for him, and I believe, let him go which way he will,
he ſhall every where meet with perſons engaged to his fortunate
valour. If your conſiderations are limited by the engagements
you have to my valour, <hi>replied</hi> Artaban, you may reflect onely
on ſervices which you might juſtly have expected from all thoſe
perſons whom fortune had favoured with the ſame opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to do them; but if you call to mind that over-confidence,
as you thought it, which you puniſhed with ſo much ſeverity
and diſdain, while I continued in <hi>Armenia,</hi> you will haply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
your ſelf more obliged to my crime, then my ſervices, and
that I had preſented you with a thing at that time, which
might have made a greater impreſſion in your memory, then
that little relief, for which you are endebted onely to my
ſword.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe words made <hi>Arſinoe</hi> bluſh, and while ſhe was conſidering
what anſwer ſhe ſhould make, <hi>Candace</hi> not well affording her the
the time to do it; <q>Ah Madam, <hi>ſaid ſhe to her,</hi> might it pleaſe
the gods that the wiſh I made ſome minutes ſince may be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed,
and that it were true that <hi>Britomarus</hi> were guilty of the
ſame infidelity towards you, which you ſo much approved, or,
at leaſt, thought ſo excuſable by reaſon of the noble cauſe
thereof.</q> 
                        <q>For matter of infidelity, <hi>replies</hi> Artaban, I am not
guilty of any towards the fair <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> for ſhe never accepted
of my fidelity, nor entertained the reſpect I had for her with
any obligation. But certain it is, Madam, that when I left you,
I brought away this young heart, which was, upon my firſt incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
grown confident enough, and laid it at the feet of
<hi>Arſinoe,</hi> and that, without all queſtion, I had ſpent my whole
life in that engagement, if the rigour of this Princeſſe, and the
pleaſure of my deſtiny, reſerving me for another vaſſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <q>But who can be confident, <hi>ſaies Eliſa to him,</hi>
not with too much earneſtneſſe, that theſe laſt chains will not
be broken as the former were, and what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

can be ſecured againſt your inconſtancy, ſince that of theſe two
fair Prieceſſes hath not been able to fix it? I am very confident,
<hi>replies Artaban,</hi> that ſhe, whoſe vaſſal I now particularly profeſſe
my ſelf to be, is not in any fear I ſhould break the chains I am
in, and am far from thinking my ſelf ſo happy, as to put her
into any fear, which might raiſe me to a degree of felicity
whereto I am not yet arrived. Might it pleaſe the gods I were
on thoſe terms with her, for I ſhould find it no hard matter to

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:97242:134"/>
me to imagine there is any need of fidelity to continue in it.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe few words he thought ſufficient as to that point, and
<hi>Eliſa</hi> was ſatisfied therewith, not inſiſting upon any further matter
of juſtification to be convinced of a fidelity, which ſhe had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
in ſo many extraordinary demonſtrations. Upon that
account was it that ſhe fell upon ſome other diſcourſe, and ſo
aſked <hi>Artaban,</hi> by what miraculous means he had eſcaped out of
the ſea, into which ſhe had ſeen him caſt himſelf, and being ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
for that day, ſhe could not hope to have any private diſcourſe
with him, ſhe entreated him to relate before thoſe Princeſſes, by
what ſtrange waies he had eſcaped, and in what manner he had
ſpent his life ſince their unexpected ſeparation. <hi>Artaban</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
himſelf to obey her commands, conceiving, as ſhe did,
that he muſt needs expect till ſome other, more favourable oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
to enter into private diſcourſe with her, when there come
into the room <hi>Agrippa, Philadelph, Ariobarzanes, Ovid,</hi> and ſome
others, who had dined that day with <hi>Agrippa. Arioborzanes</hi> and
<hi>Philadelph,</hi> how impatient ſoever they might be to ſee their belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Princeſſes, from whom, after ſo cruel an abſence, they could
hardly bear with one that took up onely ſome few minutes, found
that deſire, when they were come to the Princeſſe of the <hi>Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
lodgings, exchanged into another, <hi>viz.</hi> That of ſeeing <hi>Artaban,</hi>
whoſe great reputation had raiſed in them no leſſe curioſity for his
acquaintance then eſteem for his perſon. Aſſoon as <hi>Philadelph</hi>
ſaw him, he thought there had been ſomething more then humane
in his countenance and deportment; but <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> had no
ſooner caſt his eies upon him, but, as <hi>Arſinoe</hi> had done before,
finding <hi>Britomarus</hi> in the perſon of <hi>Artaban,</hi> he retreated ſome
few paces with an action full of aſtoniſhment, and a little after
coming up to him with his arms ſpread open, after he had craved
the pardon of <hi>Eliſa</hi> and <hi>Candace,</hi> for the freedom he took in their
preſence, he embraced with all the demonſtrations of a perfect
friendſhip, and, ſeconding his careſſes with words full of affection;
<hi>O ye juſt gods,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>is it poſſible, that in this</hi> Artaban, <hi>who is ſo
favous all over the World, I ſhould find that</hi> Briton arus, <hi>who is ſo
dear to me, and to whom both my Siſter and my ſelf are obliged
for our honour, life and liberty? Ah! no queſtion, it is the very

in</hi> Britomarus, <hi>that, from the firſt diſcoveries he made of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
we could preſume no leſſe then that they would terminate in the

                     <p>
                        <hi>Artaban,</hi> entertaing the careſſes of that truely noble and amiable
Prince with all manner of acknowledgement, and his expreſſions
of him with abundance of modeſty, anſwered him with the
reſpect he had for thoſe Princes that degenerated not from their
dignity; and, knowing withall that <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> was yet more

ſelf, looked on him with more earneſtneſſe then he had done
before, and, conſidering him as one that might juſtly be of that
number of men, whom he thought worthy his reſpects and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he accordingly expreſſed himſelf with as much freedom to
him, as he had done to <hi>Ariobarzanes.</hi> So that after he had received
his careſſes with the ſame civility, <q>It had been very much more
to my advantage, <hi>ſaid he to him,</hi> that you had had theſe favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
ſentiments towards me, when you were ſo earneſt in reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

                        <q>When
the King of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> and my ſelf, <hi>replies Philadelph,</hi> aſſiſted
<hi>Tigranes</hi> to recover his Kingdom, out of which you had forced

have afforded our friend and our kinſman; but what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
ſoever he might have made of your abſence, he would
have been but little the better for it, if that ſword of <hi>Artabans,</hi>
                           <pb n="265" facs="tcp:97242:135"/>
which commands victory where ere it comes, had ſtill been
in the ſervice of the King of the <hi>Parthians.</hi> When that
ſword purchaſed me any victorie, <hi>replies Artaban,</hi> I had
not to deale with ſuch enemies, as <hi>Philadelph,</hi> and if
<hi>Tigranes</hi> had followed your noble examples, he had never
fallen into thoſe misfortunes out of which you have ſince delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

                     <p>
                        <hi>Philadelph</hi> replied to this diſcourſe with much modeſty, and
they had continued it ſomewhat longer, if <hi>Agrippa</hi> and the reſt
of the company had not interrupted it, all looking one upon
the other with a certain eſteem and veneration. And certainly
the perſons that were then met were ſuch, that whether ſex were
looked upon, there was ſtill matter of eſteem and admiration, it
being likely to prove a hard matter to find in any other part of the
world, a like number of perſons to whom nature had been ſo libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
of her advantages.</p>
                     <p>When they were all ſate, they fell into very pleaſant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
but it was not free from ſome reſervedneſſe, and, unleſs
it were <hi>Ovid,</hi> and ſome others that came along with <hi>Agrippa,</hi>
there was not any one in that noble aſſembly that was not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deſirous of private diſcourſe with ſome particular perſon
preſent, then a generall converſation. <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> and <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delph</hi>
could have wiſhed they had been where they might with
freedom ſpeak to their Princeſſes, yet were not they the
moſt diſturbed of any, and whereas their fortunes were in a
more ſettled condition than thoſe of any of the reſt, they accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
with the more patience endured that little abatement of
their ſatisfaction. <hi>Artaban,</hi> who had not had any diſcourſe
with <hi>Eliſa</hi> ſince their ſeparation, was no doubt very deſirous
of it at that time; but being confident that he was loved to
as high a degree as he could rationally deſire, he was much
in a better condition than <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who certainly was the moſt
diſordered of the whole company. He had taken a ſeat very
neer <hi>Eliſa,</hi> but he could not ſay a word to her which muſt not
be heard by all the reſt, eſpecially <hi>Artaban,</hi> who ſate at a

they were but too too ſignificant to the conſtruction of the paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<hi>Agrippa,</hi> who, reading in them all he could fear in favour

Now there having not happened any thing of a long time
in that Country ſo remarkeable as the carrying away of <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra,</hi>
that became for ſome time the ſubject of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
and after that <hi>Agrippa</hi> had acquainted the company
with the order that <hi>Cornelius</hi> and himſelf had taken for her
recovery, and how they had ſent by land an infinite number of
perſons to find her out, and by Sea the greateſt part of the
ſhips that were in the port of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to ſo little effect
that none of all thoſe brought any account of her, all ſpake
with very much reſentment of the misfortune of that fair
Princeſſe. It went to the very heart of <hi>Candace</hi> for <hi>Caeſario</hi>'s
ſake; <hi>Eliſa</hi> out of her own excellent good nature, was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
troubled at it, and <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> and <hi>Arſinoe</hi> though the
children of <hi>Artabaſus</hi> and Brother and Siſter to <hi>Artaxus,</hi> having
not for the deplorable deſtiny of their Father, that cruell re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment
which their Brother would never quit towards the
innocent family of <hi>Mark-Anthony,</hi> but, on the contrary, calling
to mind, with tenderneſſe, the yeares they had ſpent in the
company of the Princeſſe <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and her Brothers, in the
ſame Citie and Palace, where they then were, and reflecting
on the demonſtrations they had in thoſe daies received of
their affection, were very much afflicted at that misfortune.
Inſomuch that <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> concerning himſelf in it with that
ingenious generoſitie which was obſervable in all his actions,
made a proteſtation that he would hazard his life in the ſervice
of that Princeſſe. Whereupon, <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who had privately ſeen
<hi>Alexander</hi> the day before, had furniſhed him with a veſſell,
and had in few words been informed by him how things
had paſſed, looking on <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> with a ſmile; <q>I am
very glad, <hi>ſaid he to him,</hi> to find your ſentiments of this
buſineſſe ſuitable to the greatneſſe of your courage; but I
am doubtfull whether you will perſiſt therein, when you

                        <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi>
was very much at a loſſe to hear that, but not long after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
to the former diſcourſe; <q>You entertain me, for your
own diverſion ſake, <hi>ſaid he to Agrippa,</hi> with a diſcourſe that
ſeems to have but little probability in it; but, it being ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
that the King my Brother had carried away the Princeſſe
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> I ſhould by no meanes approve his action, and would
never ſerve him in ſuch an unjuſt enterpriſe. I expected
no leſſe from your vertue, <hi>replies Agrippa,</hi> and it is upon
the experience I have of it, that, after a little recollection,
I am reſolved to acquaint you with the whole truth of that
buſineſſe, and ſhall inform you of divers other paſſages
which you muſt needs be aſtoniſhed at, after I have told
you that inſtead of ſending abroad both ſhips and men, I

would have gone in perſon, as I thought my ſelf obliged
both in point of duty, and the friendſhip I have for the
children of <hi>Anthony,</hi> in purſuit of the King your Brother,
who would needs come and carry away even out of our port
a Princeſſe of the houſe, and under the protection of <hi>Caeſar,</hi>

the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> upon the Sea; how that cruell King

away <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and <hi>Artemiſa;</hi> which he had done, not
without much regret that he could not go himſelf in

                     </p>
                     <p>During all this long diſcourſe, the prudent <hi>Agrippa</hi> made
not the leaſt mention of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> though he had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
him with his owne horſe in the wood to ride
after <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and was not ignorant of the greateſt
things he had done for the relief of that Princeſſe.
The whole company was extreamly aſtoniſhed at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> and <hi>Arſinoe,</hi>
who were doubly concerned in it, both in the perſon of
<hi>Artaxus</hi> and that of <hi>Artemiſa.</hi> They continued for a good
while all ſilent; but at laſt, <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> being unwilling
<hi>Agrippa</hi> ſhould imagine, that his diſcourſe had wrought
any change in him as to his former opinion; <q>I am
extreamly aſtoniſhed <hi>ſaid he to him</hi> at the relation you
have made of the crueltie and injuſtice of <hi>Artaxus,</hi> and
ſo far from diſapproving the procedure of <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> that,
certainly, had I been at <hi>Artaxata,</hi> at that time, I ſhould
with her have hazarded my life for the ſafety of <hi>Alexander.</hi>
The extremitie he was reduced to, by the inexorable ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of <hi>Artaxus,</hi> makes me tremble, and though he be
my Brother and my King, he ſhould not find any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the world that would more oppoſe him in
theſe horrid and deteſtable attempts. Might it pleaſe
the gods, that, notwithſtanding my obligations to him, I
might without attempting his life, deliver <hi>Cleopatra</hi>
and <hi>Artemiſa</hi> out of his hands, and I proteſt to you
that I ſhould neither ſpare my paines nor my blood
upon that account. The King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> added <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi>

Whereupon, addreſſing himſelf to <hi>Agnippa,</hi> 
                        <q>My Lord, <hi>ſaid he
to him,</hi> I have juſt now received ſome tidings from the Princeſſe
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and thoſe that carried her away. Thoſe whom we
ſent in purſuit of them, were gotten far enough hence to find
her, when in the mean time they were neerer us then can
well be imagined, inſomuch, that <hi>Flavianus,</hi> a Commander of
one of our ſhips, met, but this morning, with that, wherein
were the Raviſhers, lying cloſe under one of the Rocks, which
in ſome places hang over this coaſt, came up to her, ſaw the
Princeſſe, ſpoke with her, and fought for her deliverance with
ſo much good ſucceſſe in the beginning, that he boarded the
enemy with divers of his men, and was in a manner poſſeſſed of
her, when a certain perſon, who had not appeared at the firſt
engagement, comes up upon the Deck, without any other arms
then his ſword, and fought ours with ſo prodigious a valour,
that, having either killed or forced away all that were gotten
into the other veſſel, he ſtruck down <hi>Flavianus</hi> himſelf, loading
him with ſuch wounds, that he was incapable of fighting any
longer, and ſo by the death of the Commander, abating the
courage of the Souldiers, they gave over the enterpriſe, and
were forced to quit their attempt for the deliverance of <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra,</hi>
and to make what haſt they could into our Port. <hi>Flavianus</hi>
is brought into the City, very deſperately wounded, I have ſeen

                        <q>It was ever my opinion, <hi>ſaies Artaban,</hi>
that the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> could not be gotten far hence, and
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:97242:140"/>
that, out of all queſtion, the wounds he had received had been
the ground of his lying in that obſcure place, till ſuch time as
he were in a condition to depart. But is it not poſſible, <hi>continued
he, turning to Cornelius,</hi> we may yet come time enough for the
relief of that Princeſſe? And have you no other veſſels ready
for us in this extremity? We may make uſe of that which hath
brought in <hi>Flavianus,</hi> with what there is remaining of his men,
and ſuch others as will follow us, <hi>ſaies Agrippa to him,</hi> and ſince
that thoſe we ſeek are ſo neer us, I think I ſhall not much oppoſe
the orders of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> if I go ſome few ſtadia out of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
upon an occaſion of ſo great importance. It were not civility to
entreat either <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> or <hi>Philadelph,</hi> whereof the one is
Brother to <hi>Artaxus,</hi> the other in hopes to be, to afford us their
aſſiſtance in this emergency; but for you, generous <hi>Artaban,</hi> if
your condition, in point of health, be ſuch as may permit it,
I ſhould not refuſe your aſſiſtance, and having ſuch a ſecond with
me, I may well think our enemies muſt be very valiant to diſpute
the victory with us, I find my ſelf in a capacity to follow you,

courting the glory I conceive it is to fight under the great
<hi>Agrippa.</hi>

ſhe diſcovered in hereies the touble it was to her that he ſhould
ſo readily engage himſelf in ſuch an enterpriſe. <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> and
<hi>Philadelph</hi> knew not well what reſolution to take, there being
little probability they ſhould be drawn in to engage, the one
againſt his own brother and his King, the other againſt the brother
of his deareſt <hi>Delia,</hi> both of them being equally troubled at the
departure of their companions in order to an engagement upon ſo
juſt a quarrel. However, they knew no remedy but to take all
patiently, there being no matter of choice in the buſineſſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
ſaw, there was a neceſſity they ſhould quietly expect
what would be the event, upon the promiſe which <hi>Agrippa</hi> made
to <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> that if they met with the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> they
would treat him as a King, and would afford him the faireſt terms
he could expect, for his ſake.</p>

who ſtayed there upon the order of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> coming up to <hi>Eliſa,</hi>
acquainted her, that he had, not long before, parted with the
King of the <hi>Medes,</hi> who had honoured him ſo far as to dine with
him, and that that Prince had entreated him to know of her,
whether he might with her leave give her a viſit. <hi>Eliſa,</hi> though
naturally full of mildneſſe and compliance, ſeemed to be much
troubled at that propoſition of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and looking on him with
a little angry bluſh, that immediately ſpread over her face; <q>He
ſhall not need put himſelf to ſo much trouble, <hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi>
for after the violence he would have done me yeſterday. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
look on him otherwiſe then as my Enemy. Let me therefore
intreat you to ſpare me that affliction, if you pleaſe; and if
you will have me to conceive my ſelf at my own freedom, in a
City where you command, I beſeech you, let me not be forced to
ſee thoſe perſons, whom above all I endeavour to avoid.</q> 
                        <q>Far
be it from me, <hi>replies the Praetor,</hi> to ſide with <hi>Tigranes</hi> againſt
you, and aſſure your ſelf you ſhall be free and abſolutely at
your own diſpoſal in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> while I ſhall continue in that
power which the <hi>Emperour</hi> hath put me into: but on the other
ſide, you are to conſider, that, ſince you have the liberty to ſee
<hi>Artaban,</hi> you were not very much to be blamed, if you alſo
endured a viſit from the King of the <hi>Medes.</hi>
                        </q> 
                        <q>It is not my deſign,
<hi>replied the Princeſſe,</hi> that <hi>Tigranes</hi> ſhould be ignorant how much
I prefer <hi>Artaban</hi> before him, and that he ſhould accordingly
aſſure himſelf, that, beſides the difference which vertue hath
made between them, I muſt needs adde very much to it of my
ſelf, unleſſe he imagines I know not how to diſtinguiſh between
two men, whereof the one hath done me the greateſt injuries
he could, and the other the greateſt ſervices I could expect from
him.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who had not made this propoſition to <hi>Eliſa,</hi> but meerly
to ſatisfie the importunity of <hi>Tigranes,</hi> who had entreated him to
do it, thought it not civility to preſſe it any farther, perceiving ſhe
was offended thereat, as being a thing, which he ſaw ſhe had not
the leaſt inclination to grant. Whereupon, having taken a ſeat
ſomewhat neer <hi>Candace,</hi> he began to entertain her with the eies,
rather than with his tongue, as having not that command of his
ſpeech, as that he durſt acquaint her with his thoughts; and that
fair Queen perceiving it, would not ſuffer <hi>Eliſa</hi> to be a minute
from her, out of a fear ſhe might be left alone with him. At laſt
having obſerved that the weather was ſomewhat cloudy, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Terrace, he would needs invite the Princeſſe to take a walk about
it, not onely for the air ſake, but alſo for that there was a fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
thence into the ſea, and that they might diſtinctly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:97242:141"/>
things far beyond the place where they had met with the King
of <hi>Armenia</hi>'s ſhip.</p>
                     <p>This curioſity was a ſufficient motive to oblige them to leave
the Chamber, and <hi>Philadelph,</hi> upon the command which <hi>Arſinoe</hi>
her ſelf laid upon him, having taken <hi>Eliſa</hi> by the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

<hi>Arſinoe</hi> ſtaid with <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> and <hi>Olympia,</hi> to whom her preſence
was not any inconvenience, <hi>Cornelius</hi> very fortunately happened
to be alone with <hi>Candace.</hi> They took ſome turns upon the Terrace,
before he could ſpeak to her with any freedom, but at laſt, getting
ſome few paces before the reſt, and imagining he could not be
over heard by them; <hi>Is it poſſible, Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>that, in
a place where I may preſume, I have ſome power, I ſhould be the onely
miſerable perſon, and that I ſhould find ſo many other men happy
through the favours of thoſe Ladies whom they affect, while
you ſeem to be abſolutely inſenſible of the love I have for
you?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Candace</hi> conceived ſuch a vexation at this liberty of diſcourſe,
that ſhe was upon the point to declare to him what ſhe was, ſo to
ſtiffle the preſumption he took to ſpeak to her after that rate, as
conceiving withal that it could not be long ere ſhe were diſcovered,
and that ſhe was not ſo much obliged to conceale her ſelf, now that
<hi>Tirihaſus</hi> was dead, as ſhe had been were he living. However,
reflecting on the concernments of <hi>Caeſario,</hi> ſhe forbore to do it at
that time, out of a fear of expoſing him to ſome danger, and being
withal unwilling to diſcover her ſelf, before ſhe had taken his
advice in it. She therefore endeavoured to find out a mean, that
is, ſo to expreſſe her ſelf, that <hi>Cornelius</hi> might perceive ſhe was
diſpleaſed at his diſcourſe, yet ſo as that he might not be incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
thereat, as calling to mind how much ſhe was obliged to him,
and fearing the diſcourteſies he might do her. Upon theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,
after ſhe had continued ſome little time ere ſhe made
any anſwer, <q>That I am ſo inſenſible of the paſſion you tell me
of, as you conceive me, <hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> the onely reaſon is,
that I neither am, nor am any way deſirous to be, acquainted
therewith; but I muſt withal aſſure you, that I am extreamly
ſenſible of the civilities I have received at your hands, and
that with the remembrance thereof I have all the gratitude and
acknowledgement I ought.</q> 
                        <q>Were that certain, Madam, <hi>replied
he with ſome precipitation,</hi> you would treat after another manner,
a perſon whom you conceived your ſelf obliged to for ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
a ſervice, and you would not ſlight, with ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,
an affection which cannot any waies diſpleaſe you.</q> 
                        <q>Were
I not ſufficiently mindful of the obligations you have laid
upon me, <hi>replies Candace a little moved,</hi> I ſhould tell you that
many times, what does not diſpleaſe may be thought importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
and that to endure any mans, either injury, or importunity,
is to me equally inſupportable.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This diſcourſe put <hi>Cornelius</hi> out of all patience, and not being
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:97242:141"/>
able to diſſemble it; <q>I am very much troubled, Madam, <hi>ſaid he
to her,</hi> that I ſhould be thought importunate to you, but if you
will be pleaſed to remember your ſelf, I think I have ſometimes
found you in ſo good an humour as that you thought not my
preſence troubleſome to you, and it is yet poſſible, that if I prove
the object of your deteſtation, I ſhall not be withall that of your
contempt.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Candace,</hi> who was naturally fiery and confident enough, could
not ſmother her courage upon this diſcourſe of the <hi>Paetor,</hi> and
thereupon looking very ſcornfully upon him; <q>You have loſt,
<hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> all the glory of the ſervice you have done me,
by preſſing it to me with ſo many reproaches, and the menaces
you adde thereto, whence I perceive that you know me not,
and that when you ſhall underſtand who I am, you will haply
learn at the ſame time to ſpeak to me after another
manner.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>With theſe words ſhe ſtood ſtill, expecting <hi>Eliſa</hi> and <hi>Philadelph</hi>
to come up to her, and would have no further diſcourſe in private
with <hi>Cornelius.</hi> She made no difficulty to ſpeak that day much
more confidently then ſhe had done at any time before, becauſe ſhe
was in ſome thoughts to leave <hi>Alexandria</hi> within ſome few daies,
where if nevertheleſſe ſhe were obliged to make any longer ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>de,
ſhe knew that <hi>Caeſar</hi> was upon his arrival thither, and conſidered,
that, <hi>Agrippa</hi> being there already, ſhe ſhould not be expoſed to the
perſecutions of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> as ſhe might have been without their
coming thither. It came alſo into her mind, that if <hi>Auguſtus</hi> came
thither before her departure thence, it were not policy in her to
conceal her ſelf, out of a fear, that, if ſhe were diſcovered (as it
was very probable ſhe might, by reaſon of the commerce that was
between the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and the report which
might be ſcattered every where of her flight, and the revolutions
lately happened in her dominions) he might miſconſtrue her
lying there <hi>incognito,</hi> and might take occaſion to ſecure
her.</p>
                     <p>After ſhe had ſpent ſome time in theſe reflections, ſhe engaged
in the diſcourſe of <hi>Eliſa</hi> and <hi>Philadelph,</hi> and not long after they
made a halt for <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> and the two Princeſſes he waited
upon, to come up to them, that they might further participate of
their converſation. <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> ſeemed to be very much deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and troubled in his thoughts, and <hi>Arſinoe</hi> in no ſmall diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
there being a certain tempeſt raiſed in them by the reflections
they made on the attempt of <hi>Artaxus,</hi> and the inconveniences
likely to enſue thereupon, ſuch, it may be, as might occaſion great
alterations in their fortunes. They diſcourſed thereof for ſome
time, all having ſomething to ſay of it, (<hi>Cornelius</hi> onely excepted,
whom the laſt words and deportment of <hi>Candace</hi> had ſo netled,
that for all that day he ſpoke not a word) and after ſeveral diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,
whereby <hi>Olympia</hi> endeavoured to divert <hi>Ariobarzanes;</hi>
                        <pb n="278" facs="tcp:97242:142"/>
                        <q>I know not, <hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> what you would preſage by your
ſadneſſe; but for my part I have dreamed this laſt night, that
you preſented your ſelf before me, with a Crown of gold upon
your head.</q> 
                        <q>Could I wiſh my ſelf a Crown, <hi>replied Ariobarzanes,</hi>
you may aſſure your ſelf, my deareſt Princeſſe, that it ſhould be
onely to preſent you with it, and that it is many times no ſmall
trouble to me to conſider the rank you are pleaſed, out of
your own goodneſſe, to quit for my ſake.</q> 
                        <q>I have repreſented it
to you, more then once, <hi>replied Olympia,</hi> that you cannot do me
a greater diſpleaſure then by inſiſting on diſcourſes of that
nature; and, not to mention that you are Brother and Son, to
Kings, that by a long ſeries have ſate ſucceſſively in the Throne,
you ſhould be ſufficiently ſatisfied, that a vertue, ſuch as
yours is, is more conſiderable in my account then many
Crowns.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>While they were diſcourſing in this manner, <hi>Agrippa,</hi> with <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi>
and a great number of perſons of quality from <hi>Rome,</hi> were in
their way towards the Port. As they went, <hi>Agrippa</hi> fell into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with <hi>Artaban,</hi> whom he could not but admire in whatever
related to his perſon, and hardly forbore ſighing, when he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the many excellent qualities which made him both ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and dreadful. Yet was it not in his power to have any aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for him, as well by reaſon of the natural propenſion he had
to vertue, as that the perſonage of <hi>Artaban</hi> was ſuch, as if it had
been purpoſely made eaſily to raiſe love, and hardly averſion, in
any that ſaw it. <hi>Artaban,</hi> who had not the leaſt ſuſpicion of
<hi>Agrippa's</hi> love for <hi>Eliſa,</hi> who eſteemed him very much for his
great actions, and much more for his moderation amidſt ſo vaſt a
fortune, who was in hopes of his aſſiſtance againſt <hi>Phraates,</hi> and
was obliged to him for the refuge he had afforded him againſt
<hi>Tigranes,</hi> looked upon him with very much reſpect, and a moſt
unfained affection. The complements that paſſed between them
all the way to their coming into the Port, were accordingly ſuch
as well expreſſed the mutual admiration and eſteem they had one
towards another. They were hardly well gotten into it, but they
perceive a veſſel making all the ſaile ſhe could towards them, and
and was already within ſuch a diſtance, as that they could diſcern
the ſtreamers. The Officers of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who were with <hi>Agrippa,</hi>
had no ſooner obſerved them, but they told him it was the ſame
veſſel which had been provided for <hi>Alexander,</hi> in order to the
deſign he was then engaged in, and upon that account <hi>Agrippa</hi>
having ſtood ſtill, reſolved to waite its coming to ſhore, as taking
that to be the onely way to hear what news they might bring of
<hi>Cleopatra.</hi> They had not long to expect, for that within a few
minutes the veſſel was gotten into the Port, and immediately they
ſaw appearing upon the hatches, Prince <hi>Marcellus,</hi> with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
<hi>Cleopatra, Alexander</hi> with <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> and behind them the
Women that belonged to <hi>Cleopatra.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="279" facs="tcp:97242:142"/>
                        <hi>Agrippa,</hi> being a particular friend to all of the houſe of
<hi>Anthony,</hi> and one that had a more than ordinary honour for
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> was extreamly elevated at that ſight, nay indeed aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
at that of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> whom he thought not to be near
that Country, and of whom there had no tidings been heard;
no more than of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> ſince they both leſt <hi>Rome,</hi> much
about the ſame time. There was a very great friendſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Agrippa,</hi> though it had been often
imagined at <hi>Rome</hi> that the great authority of <hi>Agrippa</hi> might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
alteration in that particular, and that there had been many
reports ſpread abroad, that <hi>Marcellus,</hi> to whom the Empire was
deſigned, looked with ſome jealouſy on the great credit of that
Favorite of <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and had ſome thoughts to pull him a little
lower. This ſuſpicion had prevailed very much among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but thoſe, who were acquainted with the vertue of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi>
and <hi>Agrippa,</hi> were of another opinion: and beſides that
the excellent good nature of <hi>Marcellus</hi> was ſuch as forced on
him an eſteem and affection for <hi>Agrippa;</hi> on the other ſide, <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi>
loved him and looked upon him no otherwiſe than as if he had
been indeed the Son of his Benefactor, and accordingly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
what lay in his power to moderate his fortune ſo as that
he might not conceive the leaſt jealouſie thereat.</p>
                     <p>Aſſoon as he had perceived thoſe illuſtrious perſons on the
deck, he would not ſtay their coming aſhore, and thereupon,
taking <hi>Artaban</hi> along with him, took a boat and went to receive
them in their own veſſell, and at the ſame time ſent ſome of his
men to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> to give him notice of their arrivall and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
him to ſend chariots to bring the Princeſſes to the palace.
<hi>Cleopatra</hi> ſeeing theſe two great perſons appearing, one whereof
was unknown to her, came towards them with that amiable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
which purchaſed her a certain empire over all that ſaw her,
addreſſing her ſelf to <hi>Agrippa,</hi> whom ſhe knew to be one of the
beſt friends ſhe had, ſhe entertained him in the moſt obliging way
that could be, and ſurpriſed <hi>Artaban</hi> in ſuch manner with the
ſight of her admirable beauty, that how ſtrangely ſoever he might
be prepoſſeſſed with that of <hi>Eliſa,</hi> he could neither ſuffer that
luſtre without being dazled, nor forbear acknowledging the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
which heaven had beſtowed on that beauty beyond all
that were mortall. He had not ſhaken off that aſtoniſhment when
<hi>Agrippa</hi> preſented him to <hi>Cleopatra</hi> by recommending him to her
under the famous name of <hi>Artaban,</hi> and giving him withall a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
which could not any waies be denied him. This made
<hi>Cleopatra</hi> look on <hi>Artaban</hi> with an aſtoniſhment not much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from that which he had conceived at the firſt ſight of her, and
while he ſaluted her with the ſame reſpect which he would have
expreſſed towards a goddeſſe, and ſhe received him with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of kindneſſe and civility; <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Agrippa</hi> embraced
one the other, and <hi>Alexander</hi> coming forward, and preſenting
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:97242:143"/>
                        <hi>Artemiſa</hi> to <hi>Agrippa,</hi> as a treaſure he had recovered through the
aſſiſtance he had received from him, the vertuous Roman recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that fair Princeſſe with all the courtſhip that was due to her
birth, her great merit, and the friendſhip he bore <hi>Alexander.</hi>
Upon that, <hi>Marcellus,</hi> being advanced to ſalute <hi>Artaban,</hi> whoſe
name he had underſtood from <hi>Agrippa,</hi> after he had looked on
him a little, knew him to be the ſame man whom he had ſeen in
the houſe of <hi>Tiridates,</hi> at the time that that unfortunate Prince
breathed out his laſt, and called to mind the hot conteſtation
there had paſt between him and the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and how
far he had himſelf endeavoured to reconcile them. <hi>Artaban</hi> alſo
knew him, and knowing him withall to be Prince <hi>Marcellus,</hi> whom
all the Empire had a love and reſpect for, gave him no leſſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
than he would have done to <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf, and received from
him thoſe demonſtrations of the eſteem and account he made of
him ſuitable thereto.</p>
                     <p>That done, <hi>Artaban</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> ſaluted one another as two
men equally ſurpriſed, the one at the goodly preſence of <hi>Artaban,</hi>
the other at the great beauty of <hi>Alexander.</hi> But when <hi>Artaban</hi>
came neer <hi>Artemiſa</hi> to ſalute her, and that ſhe was preparing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the name of <hi>Artaban</hi> which ſhe had ſeverall times heard
pronounced, what was due to its great reputation, ſhe caſt her eies
on his countenance, and, conſidering it with ſome earneſtneſſe,
notwithſtanding the alteration which ſome yeares had wrought in
it, ſhe at laſt read in the perſon of <hi>Artaban,</hi> the ſame <hi>Britomarus</hi>
whom ſhe had ſometime known in <hi>Armenia,</hi> and for whom ſhe had
that eſteem which all the world was forced to acknowledge juſtly
beſtowed on him. While they were ſolemnizing their renewed
acquaintances, with expreſſions full of tenderneſſe and affection,
<hi>Agrippa</hi> being returned to <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> diſcovered to her the joy
he conceived at her liberty and return; and that Princeſſe who
had underſtood from <hi>Alexander,</hi> that it was he himſelf that had
furniſhed him with the veſſell and men that had come in to her
relief, and had heard but a little before that he was then coming
in perſon to find out thoſe that had carried her away, had not her
happy arrivall prevented him, expreſſed the great ſenſe ſhe had of
that obligation, in words proceeding from the greateſt gratitude
imaginable.</p>
                     <p>At laſt, this illuſtrious company cloſing up together again; and
<hi>Agrippa,</hi> having acquainted the Princeſſes with the care he had
taken to ſend for chariots to convey them to the palace, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
them to remain in the veſſell till they were come, and,
in that interim would needs know after what manner they had
been recovered, and what accident had brought Prince <hi>Marcellus</hi>
into their company. <hi>Marcellus</hi> thought it then unſeaſonable to
give any particular account of his adventures, and ſo, onely to
give <hi>Agrippa</hi> ſome ſatisfaction, told him, that he came into <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi>
juſt at the time, that <hi>Alexander</hi> was going to take ſhip,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:97242:143"/>
to find out the Princeſſes; and that, having met him and known
him upon the Port, after they had embraced one another, with
that fraternall affection wherein they had been brought up by
<hi>Octavia,</hi> he had acquainted him with the loſſe of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and
the deſign he had to relieve her, and that upon that account of
her, he without any further diſputing of the buſineſſe, went aboard
reſolved to run the ſame fortune with him.</p>
                     <p>But when the Princeſſe <hi>Cleopatra</hi> was preſſed to give <hi>Agrippa</hi>
a particular account of her being taken and her deliverance, ſhe
looked on <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> as not knowing whether ſhe
ſhould make any mention of <hi>Coriolanus</hi> before <hi>Agrippa,</hi> in whom
the concernments of <hi>Caeſar</hi> might have altered his inclinations.
But <hi>Marcellus,</hi> who was ſatisfied of the vertue of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
her to give him a faithfull relation of all without diſguiſing
any thing, aſſuring her out of the confidence he had of his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity,
that he would rather relieve than cruſh the miſerable.
Upon this confidence of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> the Princeſſe gave <hi>Agrippa</hi> a
brief narrative of what had happened to her ſince her laſt carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away, whereof the accidents of greateſt importance had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
that very day, and ſurprized him in ſuch manner, by the
relation of the great performances of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> and by that
of the King of <hi>Armenia's</hi> death, that he could not for ſome time
recover himſelf out of the aſtoniſhment which the conſideration
of ſo many extraordinary occurrences had raiſed in him. And
thereupon taking occaſion to let <hi>Cleopatra</hi> know that it was not
without reaſon that ſhe repoſed ſo much confidence in him, he
related unto her, how he had met with the diſconſolate <hi>Coriolanus</hi>
in the wood the night before ſhe was carried away the ſecond
time; how that that unfortunate Prince had diſcovered himſelf to
him by his ſpeech, and how that, not being able to do him any
other ſervice, he had beſtowed on him his own horſe, and
had paſſed over the night in the woods, after he had
ſpent the day in purſuit of thoſe that had carried her
away.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cleopatra</hi> could not forbear celebrating the generoſity of <hi>Agrippa</hi>
upon that occaſion, and being before more then halfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of the innocency of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> ſhe was not a little glad
to find that, even in his misfortunes, <hi>Agrippa</hi> continued that
Friendſhip towards him which he had ever had for him. <hi>Artaban,</hi>
before whom, upon the engagement of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who had to that
purpoſe ſatisfied <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> were related the prodigious effects of
the valour of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> was very much pleaſed with that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;
and being acquainted with that Prince by reaſon of the
combat wherein he had been engaged againſt him in the preſence
of <hi>Candace</hi> and <hi>Tiridates,</hi> and by the abode they had both ſince
made at <hi>Tiridates</hi>'s houſe, and, having accordingly conceived very
much affection and a more than ordinary eſteem for him, he
thought himſelf very much concerned, in what he had heard ſaid
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:97242:144"/>
of him, and though he concealed what he knew of him, becauſe
he ſaw there was not any neceſſity to ſpeak of it, he was earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſirous to meet with ſome occaſion wherein he might ſerve
him. And indeed it was partly upon that ground that he had ſo
generouſly proffered his aſſiſtance in order to the relief of <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra,</hi>
at a time when the poſture of his health, and other allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
motives might well have procured him a diſpenſation from
engaging in that enterpriſe.</p>
                     <p>Upon that reflection, looking on <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> and perceiving the
teares ſtanding in her eies for the death of the King her Brother,
he was troubled at the misfortune of that Prince, though he was
neither taken with his diſpoſition nor his perſon, and ſo gave the
Princeſſe his Siſter the beſt words of comfort he could. He
thought not fit to tell her any thing of <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> or <hi>Arſinoe,</hi>
becauſe <hi>Agrippa</hi> and he had ſo reſolved before, that ſhe might
be the more ſurpriſed when ſhe ſaw them; and yet when he heard
her called in the ſhip by the name of Queen <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> he could
not forbear telling them, that they ſhould not be ſo haſty to give
her that title before the Kings death were publiſhed, and that
he had a certain imagination that ſhe would not be Queen of
<hi>Armenia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This diſcourſe made <hi>Agrippa</hi> ſmile, which <hi>Marcellus</hi> perceiving
would fain have known the meaning of it, when they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>Cornelius</hi> was come with two chariots, followed by an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
number of people whom the tidings of <hi>Cleopatra's</hi> arrivall
had drawn down to the port. The name of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> was in ſo
much veneration in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and the children of that great
Queen were ſo dear in the account of the people, who had
ſeen them born and brought up in their City, that they could
not underſtand that the Princeſſe <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and Prince <hi>Alexander</hi>
her Brother, whom they had ſometimes, upon the commands of
<hi>Anthony,</hi> reverenced in a manner as gods, were coming into their
City, without running before them with exclamations, and ſuch
expreſſions of tenderneſſe, as could not admit any thing compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
thereto, but upon ſuch another occaſion.</p>
                     <p>Nor indeed did <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> much miſ-interpret
thoſe expreſſions of their affection, for they could not look on
either the walls or people of that City, wherein they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
their firſt breath, where they had paſſed over their firſt
yeares with ſo much reputation, and whence, after the deplorable
ruine of their houſe, they departed ten years before to follow
as far as <hi>Rome</hi> the fortune and the triumphall chariot of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour,
but the ſadneſſe of the commemoration muſt force them
to ſhed thoſe teares which it was impoſſible for them to keep in.
And it was the more obſervable in <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> for that ſhe never
gave over weeping from the port even to the palace, the ſight
whereof multiplied her grief when ſhe could not look on it onely
as the magnificent houſe of the <hi>Ptolomey's,</hi> but that alſo where
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:97242:144"/>
the unfortunate <hi>Anthony,</hi> and the deplorable <hi>Cleopatra</hi> had loſt
their lives with the Empire, not to mention thouſands of other
ſad circumſtances, which at the ſame time preſſed into their
memory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cornelius</hi> had ſo ordered things, that <hi>Olympia</hi> and <hi>Arſinoe,
Ariobarzanes</hi> and <hi>Philadelph,</hi> as alſo <hi>Tigranes</hi> and <hi>Artaban,</hi> were
not lodged within the Palace, becauſe that had been reſerved for
the Emperour and the <hi>Empreſſe,</hi> who were to come thither within
two daies, and how ſpacious ſoever it might be, the Emperours
retinue was ſo great, that there would be but little lodging to ſpare
for other perſons. But for the Princeſſe <hi>Cleopatra, Cornelius</hi>
thought it not fit to lodge her out of the Palace, but had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her certain rooms within that which had been deſigned for
<hi>Octavia.</hi> And <hi>Candace,</hi> either to leave the more room for the
Empreſſe, or that ſhe could not be without the company of <hi>Eliſa,</hi>
was, upon the deſires of that Princeſſe, gone along with her, and
had left her lodgings void; ſo that <hi>Cornelius</hi> finding none more
convenient for the Princeſſe <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> changed his former reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and diſpoſed of her into the place which before had been
taken up by the Queen of <hi>Ethiopia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the two Princeſſes were alighted out of the Chariots,
they met, at the bottom of the ſtaires, with <hi>Eliſa, Candace, Olympia,</hi>
and <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> with <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> and <hi>Philadelph,</hi> coming to meet
them. <hi>Agrippa</hi> immediately ſhewed <hi>Eliſa</hi> and <hi>Candace</hi> to <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra,</hi>
to whom he had ſpoken of them before in the Chariot,
and thoſe two Princeſſes coming up cloſe to her, ſhe ſaluted them,
with ſentiments not much different from that admiration which
they expreſſed at the ſight of her divine beauty. She knew <hi>Eliſa</hi>
to be ſole heir to the Empire of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and looked on
<hi>Candace</hi> as a Prince of the royal progeny of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
made the return of civility to both, which upon the ſight of
their countenances they might have chalenged from all the World;
and at the ſame time <hi>Artemiſa</hi> ſaluted <hi>Olympia,</hi> who, knowing her
to be Siſter to <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> was, through a forwardneſſe of
affection, come up to her. <hi>Artemiſa</hi> entertained, with very much
civility, the effects of an affection, whereof ſhe yet knew not the
cauſe. But when, after ſhe had diſengaged her ſelf out of her
embraces, and received thoſe of <hi>Candace</hi> and <hi>Eliſa,</hi> whom ſhe
firſt met in her way, ſhe was going towards <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> who ſtretched
out her arms with a cordial friendſhip to entertain her, and at the
ſame time caſt her eie on her countenance, as alſo on that of <hi>Ario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barzanes,</hi>
who ſtood cloſe by her, ſhe was ſeized by ſuch an aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
that had it not been for <hi>Artaban,</hi> who was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the cauſe thereof, and came forward purpoſely to hold
her up, ſhe had fallen all along on the ground.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Arſinoe</hi> kiſſed her, and embraced her with
much tenderneſſe, yet was not able to bring her to her ſelf, nor
make her apprehend that what ſhe ſaw was real. Whereupon
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:97242:145"/>
                        <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> after he had ſaluted <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> whom <hi>Agrippa</hi> had
acquainted with his name, as alſo with that of <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> taking
<hi>Artemiſa</hi> out of his Siſters hands, after he had begged the pardon
of thoſe great Princeſſes, to acquit himſelf of the civilities he
ought his Siſter, ſaluted her at laſt, with all the demonſtrations of
an affectionate friendſhip, and perceiving that that Princeſſe, aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
at the unexpectedneſſe of the interview, could not be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
out of her amazement; <hi>What, Siſter,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>will
you not know</hi> Arſinoe <hi>and</hi> Ariobarzanes? <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> with much
ado, coming at laſt to her ſelf again, and looking on them one after
another for ſome time, before ſhe would venture to ſpeak:
<q>Alaſſe, <hi>ſaid ſhe at length,</hi> I very well ſee the countenances of
<hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> and <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> but I queſtion whether I may truſt my
eies ſo far, and I find it no ſmal difficulty to be ſatisfied, whether
they are their ſhades that preſent themſelves to me after their
death, ſo wel known throughout all <hi>Aſia,</hi> or whether they appear
really before me, and without any illuſion. Aſſure your ſelf,
Siſter, <hi>replyed at the ſame time</hi> Ariobarzanes <hi>and</hi> Arſinoe, you ſee
us really, and you may embrace us without any fear, ſince we
are truely living, and have not been dead, but in the opinion of
men.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Artaban,</hi> who ſtood neer <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> gave her further ſatisfaction
as to that truth, acquainting her her in few words, how they had
both eſcaped ſhipwrack; and when the Princeſſe was convinced,
and that the careſſes of her brother and Siſter had diſpelled all
her doubts, ſhe in the firſt place gave way to certain tears, which
a tender joy would needs adde to thoſe which the death of
<hi>Artaxus</hi> ſtill forced out into her face. And then, inſtead of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the careſſes ſhe had received from <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> ſuitably to
their ancient familiarity, ſhe caſt her ſelf on her knees before him,
and taking him by the hand, and bathing it with her tears, <q>Since
it is certain, <hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> that you are <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> alive, and
that I am now abſolutely at your diſpoſal, be pleaſed to pardon
the unfortunate <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> what too too juſtifiable a gratitude
hath obliged her to do for the ſafety of <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſhe embraces
your knees to obtain that favour at your hands, and ſhe hopes,
the gods have not reſtored you to life, to raiſe in you a ſevere,
and an inexorable, judge of my actions.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> aſtoniſhed at the deportment of <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> from
whom he expected thoſe careſſes that ſpoke more familiarity,
raiſed her up with much ado, and diſcovering how much he was
ſurpriſed at it in all his looks; <q>Siſter, <hi>ſaid he to her,</hi> I apprehend
not what you mean by this kind of behaviour towards me;
and beſides, that the crime you charge your ſelf with, deſerves
rather to be commended then blamed, and that I ſhould have
done no leſſe my ſelf for the ſafety of <hi>Alexander,</hi> it is to the
King our Brother, and not to me, that this ſubmiſſion is due from
you.</q> 
                        <q>If it be due to my King, <hi>replies Artemiſa,</hi> it is to my King
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:97242:145"/>
that I make this ſubmiſſion, and ſince I am the firſt of your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
that hath demanded any favour at your hands, I am alſo
the firſt that brings you the news that you are King of
<hi>Armenia.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe words put <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> to ſuch a loſſe, that he had not
the power to make any preſent reply thereto; and during the
ſilence he kept by reaſon of the aſtoniſhment he was in, <hi>Agrippa</hi>
aſſuming the diſcourſe acquainted him with the particulars of
<hi>Artaxus</hi> his death, as he had not long before underſtood them from
<hi>Cleopatra;</hi> and in the relation he made thereof, he forgot not to
inſiſt very much upon this, that his death was purely the effect of
his own rage and exaſperation, and that his enemies had been ſo far
from contributing any thing thereto, that they endeavoured all
they could to prevent it.</p>
                     <p>

whom it could not be expected, that the inclinations of <hi>Ario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barzanes</hi>
and <hi>Arſinoe</hi> ſhould be very violent, by reaſon of the
great diſproportion there was between their diſpoſitions; yet,
being both of excellent good natures, the grief they conceived
at that unfortunate accident, was, for the preſent, ſo great, that it
could not be abated by the purchaſe of a Crown, in the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> nor, by the hopes of a more happy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of life, in that of <hi>Arſinoe.</hi> For <hi>Philadelph</hi> and <hi>Olympia,</hi> if
they were aſtoniſhed in ſome meaſure at the firſt hearing of that
news, aſſoon as it was diſperſed, joy took its place, and there was
no reaſon it ſhould give way to any thing in their apprehenſion,
it being conſidered how very much it concerned them to find
<hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> King of <hi>Arnenia.</hi> But for him, he had his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
covered with tears for ſome time, which there was not any
one thought proceeded from diſſimulation, by reaſon of the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
which all had of his vertue; and <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> by the embraces
wherewith ſhe received him, and by his courteous reception of
Prince <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſeemed to be ſo far eaſed of that burthen of ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
which till then had been very obſervable in her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
that there was not any could ſuſpect her the leaſt troubled
at the loſſe of a Kingdom, which in all probability ſhe ſhould other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
have poſſeſſed. <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> thinking himſelf obliged in
civility to retire, <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> who would needs, and conceived ſhe
ought to follow him took leave of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> for ſome ſmall time.
He was alſo immediately after followed by <hi>Olympia, Arſinoe,
Alexander</hi> and <hi>Philadelph;</hi> and the Princeſſe <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> with <hi>Eliſa</hi>
and <hi>Candace,</hi> attended by <hi>Marcellus, Agrippa, Artaban, Cornelius,</hi>
and divers others, went up the ſtaires, and was conducted by that
illuſtrious company into thoſe lodgings that had been prepared for
her. She could not prevail with <hi>Eliſa</hi> and <hi>Candace,</hi> to forbear
waiting on her thither, though that, out of the <hi>aſſurance</hi> ſhe
had of the quality of <hi>Eliſa</hi> ſhe did all that lay in her power to
prevent that civility from her, that ſhe might rather have done it
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:97242:146"/>
to her. But ſhe being the laſt come thither, and having lately eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
a danger which gave others a pretence to viſit her, ſhe was
forced to pern it it, and ſhe did it with ſuch a grace, that thoſe
two Princeſſes were infinitely taken with it. They both equally
admired that ſo famous beauty of <hi>Cleopatra;</hi> and, though nature
had been ſufficiently liberal of her excellencies in theirs, to raiſe
the ſame admiration in thoſe that knew them, and that there was
in that of <hi>Eliſa,</hi> as much delicacy and perfection, and in that of
<hi>Candace,</hi> as much grace and majeſty as ever had been obſerved in
the moſt accompliſhed beauties that ever were; yet was it certain,
that the delicacy of that of <hi>Eliſa,</hi> and the majeſty of that of
<hi>Candace</hi> were equally apparent in that of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and that if
it were very hard for any man to ſee her, and not be ſenſible of a
love towards her, it was alſo a matter of no leſſe difficulty
to look on her, and n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Candace,</hi> who thought her ſelf much more neerly concerned in
her perſon then <hi>Eliſa,</hi> and looked on her with an affectionate ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe,
as the Siſter of <hi>Caeſario,</hi> was very deſirous of ſome oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to diſcover her ſelf to her, and to enter into that meaſure
of her friendſhip which ſhe ſhould be pleaſed to admit her into.
And having heard her particularly celebrated for her prudence and
reſervedneſſe, ſhe reſolved to make her acquainted with <hi>Caeſario,</hi>
and could not but think him chargeable with a certain degree of
inflexibility, that he had remained a whole day in the ſame houſe
with her, and never offered to diſcover himſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Siſter. But for the preſent, ſhe, with the Princeſſe <hi>Eliſa,</hi> onely
expreſſed to her, in terms full of the tendreſt paſſion, how much
they were troubled at the misfortune ſhe had fallen into, and how
glad they were of her liberty and happy arrival thither. Whereto
the fair daughter of <hi>Anthony</hi> having returned thanks, for that
demonſtration of their affection with the greateſt acknowledgments
ſhe could make thereof, aſſured them on the other ſide of the
ſatisfaction it was to her to meet with them in <hi>Alexandria:</hi> and
in regard they were both ſtrangers, and might haply ſtand in need
of ſome recommendation to theſe powers which then diſpoſed of
the Empire, ſhe pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

World, to ſerve them with all the intereſt ſhe had in the friendſhip

was allyed to, in order to what they might have to propoſe, to
the Emperour, promiſing them withal, all the ſervice and aſiſtance
they night deſire in choſe traverſes of fortune which had foerced
them out of their native Countries.</p>
                     <p>The two Princeſſes received thoſe proffers with the greateſt
acknowledgments imaginable; and while they were thus engaged
in diſcourſe, <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Artaban,</hi> having not the opportunity to
entertain <hi>Eliſa</hi> as they could have wiſhed, <hi>Cornelius</hi> having not the
confidence ſo much as to come neer or ſpeak to <hi>Candace,</hi> and
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:97242:146"/>
                        <hi>Marcellus</hi> being drowned in a deep melancholy, which had hanged
upon him for ſome time before, <hi>Agrippa</hi> riſing up, ſaid, it was but
juſt to leave the Princeſſe <hi>Cleopatra</hi> to her reſt, after the travail and
vexation ſhe had undergone, and <hi>Cornelius</hi> intreated <hi>Marcellus,</hi>
that he would be pleaſed to follow him to thoſe lodgings that
were deſigned for him. By which means the Princeſſes were left
to themſelves, <hi>Artaban</hi> not preſuming to ſtay alone with them,
though he left not the room without ſome regret. But ere he went
out, <hi>Candace</hi> having called to him with much more confidence,
then <hi>Eliſa</hi> durſt have done, and calling to mind the reſolution ſhe
had taken to reconcile <hi>Caeſario</hi> and him together that night, gave
him notice to be on the Terrace at the hour ſhe aſſigned him, and
which was the ſame wherein <hi>Caeſario</hi> was appointed to come.
<hi>Artaban</hi> entertained that favour with abundance of reſpect, and
going out of the Palace very well ſatisfied, he went to give a viſit
to the new King of <hi>Armenia.</hi>

                     <p>In the mean time, <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> being retired to his own lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,

notice of the perſons that followed him, obſerves at laſt, among
many others that were in the chamber, Prince <hi>Alexander,</hi> and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined

with that ſweetneſſe and courtſhip that was ordinary and natural
in him, after he had excuſed his unmindfulneſſe of him, and the
want of reſpect he was guilty of in ſuffering him to accompany
him at that time, by confeſſing the diſturbance he then was in;

for your love to her. I ſhall not therefore tell you ſhe is yours,
for you have but too much intereſt in her for any man to diſpute
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:97242:147"/>
her with you, but I ſhall, for your further confidence, make
this proteſtation to you, and that truely and ſincerely, that your
affection to her cannot be greater, than the earneſt deſire I
have to ſerve you both in your mutual inclinations.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alexander</hi> almoſt out of himſelf for joy to hear <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi>
in theſe expreſſions, comes up cloſe to him, whereupon theſe two
Princes embraced one another, with ſo many diſcoveries of a reall
friendſhip, that the whole company could not forbear taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it, not without much ſympathy and ſatisfaction. <hi>Artemiſu</hi>
could not ſmother the felicity ſhe conceived therein, as ſeeing her
ſelf, after ſo many ſtorms proſperouſly arrived into ſo happy a
Port, and finding, by reaſon of the ſweet and generous diſpoſition
of <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> her fortune much different from what it had
been ſome few daies before. While her thoughts were the moſt
taken up to find out terms to expreſſe her ſatisfaction, or rather
to moderate it, ſhe accidentally caſt her eies on Prince <hi>Philadelph,</hi>
whom, till then, by reaſon of the diſturbance ſhe was in, and the
many illuſtrious perſons ſhe had ſeen before, ſhe had not taken
any particular notice of. And after ſhe had looked on him for
ſome time very earneſtly, ſhe found him to be that Prince of
<hi>Cilicia</hi> whom ſhe had met with ſome daies before, and who had
entertained her with a relation of his noble inclinations for <hi>Delia,</hi>
and who, upon the point of their parting, had ſo gallantly defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Princeſſe <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> againſt thoſe that would have carried
her away. <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> upon this occaſion, conceived ſuch an eſteem
for Prince <hi>Philadelph,</hi> and was ſo much moved at the relation of
his loves to <hi>Delia,</hi> that ſhe could not look on him without expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
an extraordinary joy thereat. Whereupon coming to him
with a countenance, wherein were viſible the great kindneſſe ſhe
had for him; <hi>What, my Lord,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>I have, it ſeems, the
good fortune to ſee you again, and the liberty withall once more to
aſſure you of the eſteem which I have conceaved for your admirable
vertue?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Philadelph,</hi> whoſe joy had had put him into ſo much
diſorder as <hi>Artemiſas</hi> could have done her, and who wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the opportunity to diſcover himſelf to <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> and
to put her in mind of their laſt meeting, kiſſing one of
her fair hands with the greateſt ſubmiſſion that might be;
<q>Madam, <hi>ſaid he to her,</hi> my fortunate meeting with you, proved
the prologue to that good fortune which the gods have been
pleaſed to ſend me ſince, and you may alſo inferre thence that
I was not abſolutely blinded by my paſſion, when I took you for
<hi>Delia.</hi>
                        </q> 
                        <q>How extreamly I was moved at your relation, <hi>replies
Artemiſa,</hi> the gods onely know, and conſequently you
may well think your ſelf obliged to let me know im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
whether you have had any tidings ſince of that
<hi>Delia,</hi> for whom you pretended ſo extraordinary an
affection.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="289" facs="tcp:97242:147"/>
Theſe words of <hi>Artemiſa</hi> cauſing <hi>Philadelph</hi> to look on the
Princeſſe <hi>Arſinoe</hi> with a ſmiling countenance; <q>I know not,
Madam, <hi>ſaid he to her,</hi> whether it be any prudence in me to
acknowledge my inconſtancy to you; but I cannot forbear
making this confeſſion to you, that that <hi>Delia,</hi> for whom
I had ſo much affection, hath reſigned up all the right and title
ſhe had in my heart to the Princeſſe <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> your Siſter.</q> 
                        <q>Ah
<hi>Philadelph!</hi> cries out the Princeſſe with ſome precipitation,
though my Siſter were the moſt amiable perſon in the World,
I ſhould never approve that change in your inclinations, and I
ſhould no longer continue that eſteem towards you, which I ſome
time had for you, if I thought you could be guilty of any ſuch
infidelity.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe words fell from her with ſo much earneſtneſſe, that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelph</hi>
could not forbear laughing at it in ſuch a manner, as put
him afterwards into a little diſorder, and more ſport might have
been made of it, if, by reaſon of the death of <hi>Artaxus,</hi> civility
had not obliged them to a more ſerious converſation. And yet
<hi>Arſinoe</hi> thinking it ſit to make ſome rejoinder to the former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
<hi>What Siſter,</hi> ſaid ſhe to Artemiſa, <hi>it ſeems you would adviſe</hi>
Philadelph <hi>to prefer a perſon he never knew before me?</hi> She ſaid
but theſe few words, but the action wherewith they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
raiſed at firſt ſome ſuſpicion in <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
grew into a ſatisfaction, in ſome meaſure, as to the truth of
that buſineſſe. With that reflection, looking on them both with
a countenance wherein were legible the characters of her aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
<hi>Ah Philadelph,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>is it poſſible that</hi> Arſinoe,
<hi>and</hi> Delia <hi>ſhould be the ſame perſon? Philadelph,</hi> who thought it
unſeaſonable to continue that lightneſſe of diſcourſe any longer,
diſcovered the whole truth to her, and, telling her, that that
<hi>Delia,</hi> whom he had profeſſed ſo much love to in his relation, was
the Princeſſe <hi>Arſinoe</hi> her Siſter, put her into ſuch an aſtoniſhment,
that for a long time there fell nothing from her but exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which once over, ſhe embraced a hundred times to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
that amiable <hi>Delia,</hi> and entertained <hi>Philadelph</hi> with
all the careſſes ſhe could expreſſe towards a beloved Brother.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> who all this time was in diſcourſe with <hi>Alexander,</hi>
had nevertheleſſe taken notice of what had paſſed between his
Siſters and <hi>Philadelph.</hi> And when that firſt aſtoniſhment of <hi>Artemiſa</hi>
was over, taking her by the hand, and preſenting her to <hi>Olympia,</hi>
who ſtretched out her arms to her with much affection; <hi>What,
Siſter,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>would you beſtow all your careſſes on</hi> Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delph
<hi>and</hi> Arſinoe, <hi>and will not look on my Princeſſe here, her, I
ſay, to whom I not onely owe my life, but have ſacrificed it, to make
her ſatisfaction in ſome meaſure for what I am obliged to her?
Artemiſa,</hi> without any difficulty, caſt her ſelf into the arms of
<hi>Olympia,</hi> in whom, notwithſtanding her paleneſſe, ſhe could obſerve
the tracks of an admirable Beauty, and a moſt amiable kind of
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:97242:148"/>
Majeſty. And thereupon having entertained her embraces with
abundance of affection; <hi>Be pleaſed, Madam,</hi> ſaid ſhe to her, <hi>to
charge the faults you now find me guilty of, upon my ignorance, as
conceaving, that, one, who, within theſe few minutes, knew not
whether</hi> Ariobarzanes <hi>and</hi> Arſinoe <hi>were in the World, could not have
learned whom they are obliged to for their lives, nor underſtood the
particular reſpects due from her to your ſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Olympia</hi> made anſwer to this diſcourſe of <hi>Artemiſa</hi> with a civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
ſuitable to that of the other, and the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> engaging
himſelf in their converſation, addreſſing himſelf not long after
to <hi>Olympia,</hi> and looking on her with eies full of love, and a deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which, by reaſon of the preſent occaſion of his ſadneſſe,
was ſomewhat more ſerious then ordinary; <q>Madam, <hi>ſaid he to
her,</hi> when I was ſo deſirous of a Crown to preſent you with,
the gods are my witneſſes, that it was my hope I ſhould have
arrived to it, by ſome other way then that whereby it is now
fallen to me, and that I ſhould have choſen rather to paſſe away
my life with a private fortune, then aſpired to the Throne by
the death of the King my Brother. But ſince it hath pleaſed
thoſe celeſtial powers, whoſe decrees are irreſiſtible, ſo to diſpoſe
of me, as that I am come to the poſſeſſion of the Crown of my
Anceſtors; give me leave to offer it to you, as I would offer you
that of the Univerſe, were it in my power, and be you pleaſed
to receive it from your faithful <hi>Ariamenes,</hi> as a thing of greater
value then it is, and yet as what he conceaves a thouſand times
leſſe dear, and leſſe glorious then the chains he hath worn,
and ſhall wear for your ſake to the laſt minute of his
life.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Olympia</hi> entertained this diſcourſe of <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> with a
deportment ſuitable to his that ſpoke it, and looking on him with
a countenance, which, in ſome meaſure diſcovered the preſent
ſtate of her thoughts; <q>My Lord, <hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> I have loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
on you with ſo much eſteem, even while you were without
a Crown, that that, which you have now received, can hardly
adde any thing to what you were in my account before; I
receive it with all heartineſſe and ſubmiſſion, becauſe that
with the Crown, I am confident you will beſtow on me the
Prince that is to wear it, and without the perſon of <hi>Ariobarza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
I could eaſily contemn all the Crownes and Scepters of the
Univerſe.</q> 
                        <q>I cannot beſtow <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> upon you, <hi>replied the
Prince,</hi> becauſe he is yours ever ſince the day he ceaſed to be
his own, and conſequently it is not in my power to make you
that preſent; but I might well offer you the crown, becauſe
that it is within this houre that it came to my diſpoſall, and that
till then I was not in a condition or capacity to make you any
offer thereof; and ſo, I, in ſome meaſure make your ſatisfaction
for the injury I did you, in depriving you almoſt of all hopes of
a dignity which you could not have miſſed elſewhere, and
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:97242:148"/>
which you ſlighted for your <hi>Ariamenes.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>He entertained her with a many other things that diſcovered
the greateſt kindneſſe and ſenſe of obligation that might be;
whereto the fair Princeſſe anſwered with the ſame generoſity,
and their diſcourſe might have continued yet ſome while on the
ſame ſubject, had it not been interrupted by Prince <hi>Philadelph.</hi>
                        <q>And what ſhall become of me? <hi>ſaid he to Ariobarzanes,</hi> ſhall I
make no advantage of that influence which the change of your
condition gives you over my fortunes? And will you offer me
nothing, now that you can do all things, after you had offered
me ſo much when all my hopes conſiſted meerly in the good
inclinations you had for me?</q> 
                        <q>Aſſure your ſelf, <hi>replied the King
of Armenia,</hi> that one of the greateſt advantages I ſhall hope to
make of my new dignity, is, that I may be able to do you the
civility I ought: and though you have indeed but too great an
intereſt already in <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> yet if you have that diſtruſt of her
diſpoſition, that you imagine ſhe ſtands in need of a Brothers
conſent to make her abſolutely yours, I ſhould heartily,
with that conſent, part with the crown I have received, could
I think that preſent might contribute any thing to your ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Philadelph</hi> received this diſcourſe of the King of <hi>Armenia's,</hi>
with the markes of both a ſatisfaction and a reſentment that
were indeed extraordinary, and immediately thereupon caſting
himſelf at the feet of his amiable <hi>Delia,</hi> and, notwithſtanding
her reſiſtance, kiſſing one of her fair hands, with the ordinary
ſallies of his affection, entertained her with abundance of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
conſonant to thoſe demonſtrations of Love which ſhe had
received from him in <hi>Cilicia. Alexander</hi> was in the ſame termes
with <hi>Artemiſa</hi> and <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> being alſo in the ſame humour
with <hi>Olympia,</hi> theſe ſix fortunate perſons, after ſo many ſtormes
which a malicious fortune had raiſed againſt them, finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſafely arrived at the ſo much wiſhed for port, celebrated
their happineſſe by all the obliging expreſſions, which they might
derive from ſuch an exceſſe of joy. But being mutually igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the fortunes of thoſe perſons that were ſo dear to them,
and particularly <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> who knew nothing of that of <hi>Ariobar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zanes,</hi>
and had not underſtood ſome part of thoſe of <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> and
that there were a many particulars in that of <hi>Artemiſa</hi> and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
that were unknown to <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> and <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> they would
needs be informed one of another, and thought fit to ſpend that
day in the relations of their adventures. To do this, they would
obſerve a certain order, and <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Artemiſa</hi> being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
deſirous to underſtand thoſe of <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> and <hi>Olympia</hi>
they were accordingly the firſt ſatisfied, with this proviſoe, that
<hi>Alexander, Arſinoe</hi> and <hi>Philadelph</hi> ſhould afterward give them an
account at large, of what, of their fortune, was not as then come
to their knowledge. <hi>Artaban</hi> coming into the room while they
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:97242:149"/>
were thus engaged, and being very kindly entertained by all
thoſe illuſtrious perſons that were preſent, diverted them not
from the reſolution they had taken. And being a perſon they
might well truſt with their concernments, he hearkened, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
much ſatisfaction to a many things, whereof, as having had
an imperfect account of them before, he was very much pleaſed
with the relation, and would needs ſup with that noble compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and ſpend his time in it till the houre aſſigned him by
<hi>Candace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the mean time the Princeſſe <hi>Cleopatra</hi> ſtirred not out of her
own chamber, where ſhe had with her <hi>Eliſa</hi> and <hi>Candace,</hi> and
aſſoon as the Princes were departed the roome, the two Princeſſes
imagining, not without reaſon, that <hi>Cleopatra</hi> might ſtand in need
of reſt, took their leaves of her, and went to their own lodgings
which were cloſe by. <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> upon their importunity laid her
ſelf upon the bed, and reſted for an houre; but that time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired,
ſhe got up, any having underſtood what quality <hi>Eliſa</hi> was
of, and had ſome account of <hi>Candace,</hi> and finding her ſelf incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to a great eſteem and affection for both, ſhe would put off no
longer the returne of a civility which ſhe conceived ſhe ought
them, and going out of her own chamber with her woman <hi>Camilla,</hi>
ſhe went to that of <hi>Eliſa.</hi> The two Princeſſes quarrelled very
much at her for that ſtrictneſſe of ceremony, and ſeemed to be
very much troubled, that ſhe had taken ſo little time to reſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
the great trouble and hardſhip ſhe had undergone. But
ſhe made them anſwer, that the reſt which her body might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
was not ſo conſiderable to her as the obligation ſhe thought
lay upon her to return their civilities, nor ſo deare to her as the
honour to wait on them, which ſhe was not able to diſpenſe with
any longer after ſhe had been deprived of their ſight with ſo much
precipitation.</p>
                     <p>The two Princeſſes made her anſwer with equall civility, and
whereas <hi>Candace</hi> was already paſſionately in love with her, as
well out of a conſideration of her excellent endowments, which
might produce that effect in any one, as upon the account of
<hi>Caeſario,</hi> and was very deſirous to be more intimately acquainted
with her, looking on her in a moſt paſſionate manner; <q>As for
the fair Princeſſe of the <hi>Parthians, ſaid ſhe to her,</hi> whoſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
merit makes an immediate aſſault on all hearts, and
whoſe illuſtrious birth is known to you, ſhe may without any
unjuſt preſumption claim ſome place in your friendſhip, and
there are few ſoules can ſtand out long againſt her charmes, if
ſhe thinkes fit to make uſe of the battery thereof. But for one
whom you have no other account of then that ſhe is a perſon of
ſome quality born in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and cannot aſpire above a medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity
of parts, ſhe cannot rationally hope for the ſame advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
if in ſome meaſure, to ballance thoſe wherein <hi>Eliſa</hi> ſo
much excells her, ſhe could not pretend to ſomething, that,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:97242:149"/>
more particularly recommends her to your notice.</q> 
                        <q>For matter
of recommendation, <hi>replied the Princeſſe, ſmiling at the modeſty
of her diſcourſe,</hi> there is ſo much legible in your face, that
it were ſupererogatory in you to look for any elſewhere; and
as for your being born in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> you are never, for that, the
leſſe worthy of our affections and our reſpects. I am not, I muſt
confeſſe, made abſolutely acquainted with your birth, though I
have underſtood ſomething of it; but beſides what I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
of the Princeſſe <hi>Eliſa's</hi> familiarity and behaviour towards
you, there are a many other arguments whence I inferre, that
your quality muſt needs be of the higheſt, and I ſhall haply
know more of it, when you ſhall be ſo well acquainted with
me, as to think I may be truſted with a ſecret of that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</q>
                        <q>I know not, <hi>replied the Queen,</hi> whether I can with
civility diſtruſt you; but, beſides the bent of my own incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
which naturally engages me into a very great confidence
of you, I have haply ſome very particular reaſons to diſcover
that to you, which I have not to any but the Princeſſe of the
<hi>Parthians.</hi> And therefore to begin with ſomething, I ſhall make
no difficulty to acknowledge my ſelf to be <hi>Candace,</hi> Queen of
<hi>Ethiopia,</hi> whom Fortune hath been pleaſed to caſt on theſe coaſts,
and that diſpoſſeſſed of a Kingdome, which ſhe hath ſince reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by the aſſiſtance of a perſon not unknown to you.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon this diſcourſe of <hi>Candace, Cleopatra</hi> aſked her pardon,
in caſe, through an ignorance of her quality, ſhe had been awan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
as to point of civility towards her, and gave her many
thankes for the confidence ſhe was pleaſed to repoſe in her, with a
proteſtation that ſhe ſhould make no other advantages of that
acknowledgement of her, then ſuch as might give her the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
to ſerve her, if ſhe ſhould be ſo happy as to find them. And
thereupon reflecting on the laſt words that fell from her whereby
ſhe confeſſed her ſelf obliged for the recovery of her Crown to
a perſon of her acquaintance; <q>May I pretend to ſo much hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe,
<hi>ſaid ſhe to her,</hi> as that there ſhould be a perſon within
the reach of my knowledge, that may have done you a ſervice
of ſo great importance as that you tell me of, and can I beg his
name of you without preſuming too farre upon the confidence
you have honoured me with.</q> 
                        <q>I hope, it will not be long,
<hi>replied Candace,</hi> ere I ſhall make you far greater diſcoveries of
him than that of his name, and, it may be, renew your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
inclinations towards a perſon upon whoſe account I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
ſo much upon your friendſhip; but till that happen, give
me leave to aſke you whether you did not ſee <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> in the
houſe where Prince <hi>Alexander</hi> made ſome little abode upon his
arrivall neer <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
                        </q> 
                        <q>It is very true, <hi>replied Cleopatra,</hi> that
I have ſeen him in that houſe, where I ſtaid one night and ſome
part of the next day, till ſuch time as I was carried away thence:
<hi>Alexander</hi> procured me the ſight of him in his bed, which he
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:97242:150"/>
was confined to by reaſon of ſome wounds, ſo that I could not
ſee him with as much advantage in that condition, as, no
queſtion, I ſhould have done in another. But to meaſure
him by that little obſervation I then made of him, I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
as well in his countenance as his diſcourſe, ſomething
that argued a certain grandeur much beyond the ordinary
rate of men; and it now comes into my mind, that my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
procured me that ſight of him as a perſon of a great and
noble fame, and told me withall, that his name was much
cried up in <hi>Ethiopia</hi> for many famous victories.</q> 
                        <q>
                           <hi>Alexander</hi>
replies <hi>Candace,</hi> hath told you no more of him than Truth
will juſtifie; but I am in hope that he will bring both you
and <hi>Alexander,</hi> thoſe tidings of a perſon whom you once
thought very deare, which may prove very advantageous to
me, and very much further the deſigne I have to purchaſe
your friendſhip; and it is for that onely reaſon, that I aſked
you whether you had ſeen him, and that I am deſirous to
give you another ſight of him before this night be quite paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
if you give me the liberty to do it.</q> 
                        <q>It cannot be,
<hi>replied the fair Princeſſe,</hi> but too great a ſatisfaction to me,
to ſee a man ſo conſiderable, both upon the account of his
own worth, and the great ſervices he hath done you, and I
think my ſelf ſo much concerned already in whatever relates to
you, that I cannot but with much more intereſt than hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
look on a man to whom you are obliged for the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of your Crown. Not, Madam, that any conſideration of
his perſon, or the hopes I may conceive within my ſelf of him
can adde any thing to the reſpect which I have already for you;
and aſſure your ſelf, that if the friendſhip you are pleaſed to
deſire of me, were any thing of far greater value then it is, I
ſhould gladly offer it you by way of exchange for that which I
deſire of you.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Candace,</hi> extreamly ſatisfied with this diſcourſe of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi>
made her anſwer in terms ſo affectionate, that the fair daughter of
<hi>Anthony,</hi> as well out of conſiderations of gratitude, as for the
remarkable excellencies of that great Queen, felt in her ſelf a
more then ordinary inclination to love her as much as lay in her
power, and began to give her the greateſt aſſurances ſhe could
thereof. Which <hi>Eliſa,</hi> who had been ſilent all the time, very much
obſerving, and not able to endure it any longer without ſome
diſcoveries of her jealouſie; <q>What, Madam, <hi>ſaid ſhe to Candace
ſmiling,</hi> you are, it ſeems abſolutely reſolved to engroſſe the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of this fair Princeſſe to your ſelf, and would not ſuffer me
to have any place therein, though poſſibly my deſires of it are
not inferiour to yours?</q> 
                        <q>If you diſpute it with me, <hi>replies Candace,</hi>
no queſtion but you will clearly carry it from me, but if you
do, you muſt look on it as the pure effect of your merit, whereas
I have ſome reaſons to pretend thereto, which you cannot any
waies alledge.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="295" facs="tcp:97242:150"/>
                        <hi>Cleopatra</hi> perceiving this obliging conteſtation of the two
Princeſſes, found it no great difficulty to give them ſatisfaction;
and indeed they were both of them ſo amiable, that ſhe was eaſily
inclined to afford them thoſe demonſtrations of her affection
which they deſired, that is, ſuch as could not well be denied them.
But the diſcourſe of <hi>Candace,</hi> whence ſhe might have inferred
that ſhe muſt needs have ſomething of news to acquaint her with,
raiſing a certain curioſity in her, ſhe could not forbear diſcovering
to her the deſire ſhe had to be ſomewhat better iuformrd then ſhe
was, of her affairs, as alſo of thoſe of the fair Princeſſe of the
Parthians. Which they were no ſooner ſenſible of, but they
were both very ready to afford her that ſatisfaction, and having
obliged her to caſt her ſelf on the bed, upon which they ſate by
her; <hi>Candace</hi> gave her a more brief account than ſhe had done
to <hi>Eliſa,</hi> of the adventures of the greateſt conſequence that had
happened to her; but in her diſcourſe ſhe diſcovered nothing of
the birth of <hi>Caeſario,</hi> and calling him all the way <hi>Cleomedon,</hi>
repreſented him onely as a Prince come for refuge into her
dominions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cleopatra</hi> having admired the ſtrange accidents of <hi>Candaces</hi>
life, and expreſſed how much ſhe was moved thereat, with no ſmall
affection, gave hearing afterwards to what ſhe was yet to learn of
thoſe of <hi>Eliſa;</hi> I ſay what ſhe was yet to learn, for the greateſt
part thereof was already come to her knowledge from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
reporter of all things, Fame, who had divulged the moſt
memorable of her adventures. By theſe diſcourſes of the two
Princeſſes, <hi>Cleopatra</hi> became better acquainted then ſhe had been
before, with both <hi>Artaban</hi> and <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> and looked on them as
the onely two in the World, whom ſhe might juſtly compare to
her own <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> and having underſtood from them the deſign
they had to have them reconciled that night, and to oblige them
to forget the great differences that had been between them, ſhe
very much approved their reſolution. And being further ſatisfied,
that <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> for very good reaſons, could not come to viſit
<hi>Candace</hi> till ſuch time as all other people were in their beds, ſhe
aſſured the Queen that ſhe would gladly return into their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
at that time, if ſhe thought it ſit, that ſhe might take better
notice then ſhe had done before of two men ſo particularly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,
as alſo to underſtand from <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> what the Queen had
put her in hopes of, concerning him. They continued their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
of this nature till ſupper time drew neer, and having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
their deſires to eat together, all things were accordingly
prepared in a Parlour, not far from their lodging rooms, whither
they were conducted, and immediately after ſupper, returned to
<hi>Cleopatras</hi> Chamber, to paſſe away the evening with ſuch as ſhould
come to viſit them, and whom, by reaſon of their rank, they could
not deny that civility, with a reſolution withal to meet together at
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:97242:151"/>
                        <hi>Eliſas</hi> Chamber, when all were withdrawn.</p>
                     <p>Immediately after they were gotten into the Chamber, as they
had imagined, they were viſited by <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who
had ſupped together at <hi>Agrippas, Cornelius</hi> having, as it ſhould
ſeem, ſpent that evening with the King of the <hi>Medes,</hi> with whom
he had contracted a friendſhip, and was engaging in ſome deſignes
of his. <hi>Marcellus,</hi> whoſe company was infinitely pleaſant, when
His mind was in a ſerenity free from the tempeſts of his diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
entertained the Princeſſes for ſome time, with an account
of ſome particular obſervations he had made in his late voyage;
when in the mean time <hi>Agrippa,</hi> finding an opportunity to ſit by
<hi>Eliſa,</hi> ſo as that <hi>Candace</hi> was not ſo neer her as ſhe was wont to
be, that fair Princeſſe could not avoid, but that he might ſpeak to
her, yet not be over-heard, and conſequently that he might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
her with his love. She would have called <hi>Candace</hi> to a
relief which they mutually afford one the other, by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination
againſt both <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Cornelius,</hi> could ſhe without
incivility have done it: but <hi>Agrippa</hi> was a perſon of that rank,
and, withal, of ſuch worth in himſelf, that the Princeſſe, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome reaſon, was afraid to diſoblige him, and thereupon
reſolved to endure his diſcourſe, as being out of neceſſity forced
to do it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Agrippa</hi> having thus broken the ice, and removed the firſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
he found it ſo much the leſſe to carry on his deſign; and
after ſome diſcourſe of an indifferent nature, perceiving that he
might ſpeak without any fear of being heard: <q>Is it poſſible, <hi>ſaid
he to her,</hi> that, in a place where I have the honour to waite on you
at any time, I have with much ado got the advantage of this little
interval, to give you ſome aſſurances of that ſubmiſſive paſſion
which I have for you? Or rather am I to imagine, that the firſt
diſcoveries I made to you thereof, have incenſed you ſo
much againſt me, that you ſhould avoid my company as
you do?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>No doubt but <hi>Eliſa,</hi> was ſufficiently troubled at theſe words,
yet would ſhe not diſpleaſe <hi>Agrippa,</hi> whom ſhe thought her ſelf
obliged to, whoſe power ſhe was afraid of, and whoſe vertue ſhe
highly eſteemed. Accordingly, rejoyning to his diſcourſe with an
accent full of mildneſſe and modeſty; <q>I have but too great
eſteem, <hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> both for your worth and your perſon,
to ſhun your converſation, and therefore if you find any repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
in me as to that point, it does not proceed from either of
thoſe two cauſes; and I ſhould both ſee you and hearken to
you with very much ſatisfaction, had you ſo much goodneſſe for
me as to make ſomething elſe the ſubject of your diſcourſe.</q> 
                        <q>My
diſcourſe ſhall be of what nature you ſhall approve of, <hi>replies
Agrippa,</hi> but I cannot, without a great violence to my ſelf,
forbear telling you, that I dye for your ſake, and that, though you
ſhould forbid my mouth to tell you ſo much, it were very hard
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:97242:151"/>
for my eies to afford you the ſame obedience, and that they ſhould
not, in ſome meaſure, expreſſe the effects of what you have
cauſed in my heart.</q> 
                        <q>I am eaſily perſwaded, <hi>replied the Princeſſe,</hi>
that you do not feel all that you would have me believe; and
I cannot but have that confidence of your generoſity, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of what your diſcourſe might very well put me in fear of,
I ſhall find onely, where you are, a ſanctuary againſt that perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which I have run through ſo many dangers to avoid.</q> 
                        <q>I
ſhould think my ſelf the moſt unfortunate man in the World,
<hi>replyed Agrippa,</hi> if you ſhould look with the ſame eies on the love
of <hi>Tigranes,</hi> and that which I have for you, and call that by the
name of perſecution, which is, on the contrary, a paſſion full of
reſpect and veneration, ſuch as mine is, as you do the violence
of a Prince, who, by force and tyranny hath ſought that which
he ſhould have patiently expected from your own good liking.
I knew, Madam, that the enterpriſe, I engage my ſelf in, is of
no ſmal difficulty, when I would diſpute a heart prepoſſeſſed by
another affection, and that an affection dearly purchaſed by
an exceſſe of merit, and which you have, not without much
reaſon, conceaved for him, who, of all men, hath ſhewn himſelf
the moſt worthy of it, as well by his vertue, as the tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
of his actions. But I ſhall entreat you withall to aſſure
your ſelf, that it is not by condemning it, that I ſhall endeavour
to ruine it, to my advantage; and obſerve, that I freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<hi>Artaban</hi> to be worthy of his fortune above all the men I
have known, and, that it is not my own will that inclines me to
traverſe his affections, but that it proceeds meerly from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
you do me, which is ſuch as I have ineffectually endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to overcome by all the reaſons which you could your
ſelf have alledged againſt it. Do not therefore conſider what I
do againſt him as a voluntary action, which might be condemned,
but as a forced action, and conſequently rather deſerving your
pitty, then his reſentment; and pardon, if you pleaſe, the deſign
I have to diſpute your affections with him, which I ſhall not do
out of any conſideration of <hi>Caeſars</hi> authority, and the power he
hath inveſted me with through the whole extent of his Empire,
but by my love and ſervices.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this effect was the diſcourſe of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and the Princeſſe
finding ſome comfort in the concluſion of it, and in what he had
ſaid to the advantage of <hi>Artaban;</hi> 
                        <q>It hath ever been my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion,
<hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> that, what deſign ſoever you might be
engaged in, you would make uſe of no other force then
that of vertue it ſelf to effect it; and that is it indeed which
makes you more conſiderable then the ranck you are in, or the
friendſhip of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and it is from the ſame vertue that I am
inclined to hope you will overcome a paſſion, which may haply
expoſe your reputation to ſome reproach by thwarting the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:97242:152"/>
and felicity of thoſe that caſt themſelves under your
protection.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe words troubled <hi>Agrippa</hi> more than any thing elſe could
have done, as being levelled at him in point of generoſity and
honour; and indeed, great ſouls, ſuch as was really his, are far
more ſenſible of aſſaults of this nature, then thoſe which proceed
meerly out of a conſideration of difficulty or danger. He accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
was at a little loſſe what return to make thereto, but when
he had recollected himſelf a little; <q>It is not for <hi>Agrippa, ſaid
he to her,</hi> to afford protection, within the territories that are
under the ſubjection of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> to a daughter of the King of
<hi>Parthia. Caeſar</hi> may be ſaid to protect you, and I may contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
my ſervices to his protection; but it concerns me ever to
be ſuppliant and ſubmiſſive to you, and to account my ſelf your
vaſſal, rather than your Protector: under this qualification of
vaſſallage, which I conceave honourable enough for me, and not
under that other of protection, which I could not pretend to
without inſolence, it may be lawful for me, upon equal terms, to
engage againſt my Rival, and in this kind of engagement, I ſhall
not ſeem very dreadful to a perſon, of whoſe ſide the victory is
already declared.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>He would have ſpun out this diſcourſe to a greater length, had
not <hi>Candace,</hi> troubled to ſee the Princeſſe ſo engaged, ſtarted a
queſtion to her, purpoſely to break it off, and, not long after, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
her to quit <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and to participate of their converſation.
It continued not long that night, for <hi>Eliſa</hi> and <hi>Candace,</hi> to oblige
<hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Agrippa</hi> to withdraw the ſooner, bid <hi>Cleopatra</hi> good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night;
telling her, that, the better to recover the reſt ſhe ſo much
wanted, it was but fit ſhe ſhould go to it ſomewhat ſooner then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.
Whereupon the two Princeſſes departed to their own lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Agrippa,</hi> having taken their leaves of them,
left the room at the ſame time.</p>
                     <p>The two Princeſſes were no ſooner alone, but <hi>Eliſa</hi> acquainted
<hi>Candace</hi> with the diſcourſe that had paſſed between her and
<hi>Agrippa,</hi> and the Queen of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> gave her an account at the
ſame time of what ſhe had had that day with <hi>Cornelius.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they adviſed with one another what they ſhould do in that
caſe, and ſpent ſome time in deliberating whether they ſhould
acquaint their Lovers with that new emergency. They found very
ſtrong reaſons on both ſides, as well to oblige them to do it, as to
divert them from it, and they were abſolutely unreſolved what to
do, when <hi>Artaban</hi> comes into the room. Tis, out of all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
that <hi>Eliſa</hi> was infinitely deſirous to ſee him, yet could ſhe
not look on him at ſuch an hour, without bluſhing at the freedom
ſhe gave him; and though ſhe loved him to that degree which ſhe
conceived her ſelf obliged to do, as well by way of recompence
for his great ſervices, as out of her own inclination, yet had ſhe
not ever granted him any favour that derogated from the ſtricteſt
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:97242:152"/>
obſervances of honour and her ſex; and had not been perſwaded
to this ſecret enterview, but out of complyance with <hi>Candace,</hi>
whoſe authority, rather then any thing elſe, ſatisfied her ſcruples,
and prevailed with her to grant it in order to the interview which
ſhe ſo much endeavoured between <hi>Caeſario</hi> and him. <hi>Candace,</hi>
though ſhe had no leſſe devotion to vertue then the other, might
preſume upon a greater liberty, and beſides, that ſhe could not
ſee <hi>Caeſario</hi> but at ſuch hours, ſhe was abſolutely at her own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal,
as well in regard of her perſon as her dominions. Adde
to that, that in her favouring <hi>Caeſario,</hi> and beſtowing on him her
Crown with her perſon, as ſhe was reſolved, ſhe complyed with
the will, and obeyed the commands of her father, who, in his life
time, and at his death, had publickly declared ſuch an intention, and
had abſolutely ordered it ſhould be ſo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eliſa</hi> entertained <hi>Artaban</hi> with her ordinary ſweetneſſe and
modeſty; and <hi>Candace,</hi> having treated him with all manner of
civility, <q>You are now ſatisfied, <hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> that I am not
much inclined to revenge, and that notwithſtanding the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which your inconſtancy might well raiſe in me againſt
you, I yet think it not much to procure you ſuch favours as
you had not haply ever received before.</q> 
                        <q>I muſt indeed confeſſe,
<hi>replies Artaban,</hi> that this favour is a pure effect of your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
but ſhall not acknowledge, if I may be ſo free with you,
that you had any great reſentment to ſtruggle with, for a loſſe
you were not any way ſenſible of.</q> 
                        <q>The loſſe cannot be thought
light, <hi>replies Candace,</hi> when one looſes ſuch a man as <hi>Artaban:</hi>
but it hath been the pleaſure of our deſtinies to diſpoſe of us
both otherwiſe, and for that reaſon it is but fit we forbear all
reproaches. But I muſt tell you withal, that I have not been the
inſtrument to procure you this ſight of <hi>Eliſa,</hi> beſides your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
without ſome little By-concernment; and that is, a
requeſt that both ſhe and I make to you, that you and <hi>Cleomedon</hi>
have an interview in this room, that you embrace one the other
in our preſence, and, if it be not impoſſible, become good friends,
as your fair Princeſſe and my ſelf are.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Artaban</hi> receiving this diſcourſe of <hi>Candace,</hi> with a great ſenſe
of the obligation ſhe laid upon him; <q>I am very much troubled,
Madam, <hi>ſaid he to her,</hi> that you ſhould not make trial of the
reſpect I have for you, by a teſt of my obedience, wherein I might
find more difficulty, then there can be in that which you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to me; for the friendſhip of <hi>Cleomedon</hi> is a thing, whereof
the purchaſe is ſo advantageous, that I cannot entertain the
offer you make me of it, otherwiſe then as a recompence you
are pleaſed to allow me, and not as a puniſhment that you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
upon me. I may adde to this, that he hath put a late obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
upon me, which ought to have a greater influence on my
ſoul, then that unreaſonable averſion which heretofore I ever
found bandying againſt that affection which his vertue might
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:97242:153"/>
raiſe in me for him, and I conceive my ſelf engaged to him in
much more than my life amounts to, ſince I muſt acknowledge
the liberty of my Princeſſe, an effect of the relief ſhe received
from his valour, when ſhe was in the armes of <hi>Tigranes. </hi>
                        </q>
                        <q>
                           <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,
ſaid Eliſa to him, very much ſatisfied with his diſcourſe,</hi>
aſſure your ſelf, you cannot any way oblige me ſo much as by
this kind of proceeding, and there is ſuch an union between
this fair Queen and my ſelf, that it were very unjuſt there
ſhould be any difference between the objects of our Loves.
<hi>Cleomedon</hi> made in a manner the ſame anſwer, when we made
the ſame propoſition to him; and accordingly, it is no ſmall
ſatisfaction to me, to ſee that we ſhall find it no hard matter to
eſtabliſh between you a friendſhip not unlike ours.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>While <hi>Eliſa</hi> ſpoke in this manner, <hi>Candace,</hi> deſirous to favour
<hi>Artaban</hi> all ſhe could, pretending ſhe had ſome buſineſſe to do
in a cloſet, that was within the room, took occaſion to go into
it for ſome time. Which intervall the paſſionate <hi>Artaban</hi> making
his advantage of, caſt himſelf at the feet of <hi>Eliſa,</hi> and embraced
her knees, with all the moſt affectionate demonſtrations of that
paſſion, which ſhe was already ſo well acquainted with; and
whereas he could not expreſſe that tranſcendency of joy which
then poſſeſſed him, otherwiſe than by confuſed and broken words,
the fair Princeſſe thought his love more legible in that diſorder,
than it had been in a diſcourſe well couched, and actions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from the greateſt recollection. The preſence of <hi>Vrinoe</hi>
(for <hi>Cephiſa</hi> was walking upon the Terrace with <hi>Clitia</hi> in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Caeſario's</hi> coming) hindred him not from giving thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of kiſſes to the fair hands of his Princeſſe; and this being
the greateſt favour he could expect from her, ſhe could not deny
it him in ſo favourable an opportunity, and that eſpecially after
a ſeparation, which had cauſed her to bewaile his loſſe with ſo
many teares. Nay, ſhe had much ado to keep them in now, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the reflections ſhe made on it, and looking on him in the
moſt amorous manner that could be, with thoſe very eies which
had ſet him ſo much on fire; <q>Ah Artaban, <hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi>
what reall afflictions hath your imaginary death coſt me! and
what abundance of teares have I ſhed out of that cruell per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion!</q>
                        <q>Ah Madam, <hi>replied Artaban,</hi> how precious ought I
to eſteem that death, and how deare thoſe teares! The reſt of
my life is no way comparable to that fortunate death, no, it
was not either my life or death could deſerve thoſe teares, which
compaſſion drew from your fair eies.</q> 
                        <q>But is it not time, <hi>added
the Princeſſe,</hi> I ſhould know, by what adventure it came to
paſs that you are now alive; or am I ſtill to be ignorant
what good fortune it is that we are obliged to for your
ſafety?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Artaban</hi> was going to acquaint her in what manner he had
eſcaped drowning; but <hi>Eliſa,</hi> remembring her ſelf how that the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:97242:153"/>
night before, <hi>Candace</hi> would needs have her to be preſent at
the arrivall of <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> and being a little aſhamed that ſhe had
ſuffered her to withdraw into the cloſet, ſhe called her, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
her to participate of their converſation as ſhe had done
of the diſcourſe that had paſſed between her and <hi>Cleomedon,</hi>
and underſtand, how <hi>Artaban</hi> had eſcaped the fury of thoſe
waves into which he had caſt himſelf, ſince that in all likelihood
the relation he was to entertain them with would not be ſo long
but that he might well go through it before <hi>Cleomedon</hi> came in.
<hi>Candace</hi> made her anſwer, that ſhe ſhould gladly hearken to any
thing wherein ſhe thought her ſelf concerned, and after ſhe was
ſet down by her; <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaies Artaban to her, <hi>ſince that there
are but few daies ſince my falling into the Sea, I ſhall not need many
words to acquaint you with what hath happened to me from that
time, and ſhall not abuſe your attention long with an account of
things of little conſequence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is not without ſome reaſon, <hi>continued he, ſpeaking to Candace,</hi>
that you ſaid you were concerned in my ſafety, or at leaſt I may
well ſay that you have contributed very much thereto, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that I am not a little obliged to you for it. <hi>To me, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the Queen, ſomewhat aſtoniſhed at what he ſaid?</hi> Even to
you, Madam, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> more then any other; and had it not been
for that generous action which you did in ſetting <hi>Zenodorus's</hi> ſhip
on fire, that action, I ſay, which carried in it a more ſhining de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
of your vertue then the fire you kindled on the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I had infallibly loſt a life, which I could not long have made
good againſt the violence of the waves, being armed all over,
my buckler hanging about my neck, and being at too great a
diſtance from the ſhore to recover it by ſwimming, even though
I had had nothing of armour about me. Their weight had once
already forced me to the bottome, where I had rolled my ſelf
for ſome time upon the ſand, when by the violence of a Billow
I was again brought up to the top of the water, where, as good
fortune would have it, I met with a plank, halfe burned, of
<hi>Zenodorus's</hi> veſſell, which ſtruck againſt my head, and, not long
after, touched againſt my hand. Though my condition was ſuch
that I had but little knowledge or apprehenſion left, yet made I a
ſhift to do that, which they ſay is naturall to all men in the like
extreamity, which is, to faſten on any thing they can: and ſo,
embracing the plank, which was thick and heavy, I did ſo well
with the help of it that I got my head above water, and had the
liberty to breath; inſomuch that, by degrees, I got it under me,
in ſuch a manner, that it bore me up, with the help of my legges,
which I moved to and fro, as if I were ſwimming, the beſt I
could. But I was, withall, ſo weary, ſo much troubled with the
water I had ſwallowed, and ſo loaden with my armour, that I could
not hope to eſcape with that help alone, though I endeavoured with
all the remainder of my ſtrength, to force the plank towards the
ſhore.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="302" facs="tcp:97242:154"/>
Being in this extremity, it pleaſed the gods to direct certain
Fiſher-boats whereof there are a many upon that coaſt, towards
the place where I was, which was not very far from the ſhore.
Thoſe that were in them taking notice of the gliſtering of my
head-piece, and perceiving the top of my plume of feathers all
wet, imagining what the matter might be, came up with one
of their boats to my relief, and indeed it came juſt at the point
that I ſtood very much in need of it, and was reduced to my
laſt ſhifts. They took me into their boat, diſarmed me, and at
the ſame time made me caſt up the ſalt water I had drunk, and
when they ſaw I had a little recovered my ſelf they took me
aſhore and brought me to one of their cottages. There was I
forced, by reaſon of the hardſhip I had undergone, and the
ſad condition I was in to reſt my ſelf for ſome houres,
as being ſo ſpent, that I was hardly able to ſtand on my
Legges.</p>
                     <p>I had not been there long ere the memory of my misfortunes
began to torment me, and thereupon repreſenting to my ſelf how
that I left the Princeſſe under the power of a cruell Pyrate, and
that I was without men, without veſſell, and knew not any way
how to relieve her, my grief came upon me with ſo much violence,
that I was in a manner reſolved to go and ſeek, in the bowells of
the Sea that death, which I had with ſo much difficulty eſcaped;
and certainly I think, that, had I not been prevented by thoſe
good people, I ſhould have executed that fatall reſolution;
but indeed my weakeneſſe was with all ſuch, that it was
eaſie for them to keep me on a ſorry bed whereon they
had caſt me, and where I had already paſſed away ſome
houres.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall not trouble you Madam, <hi>continued he addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to</hi> Eliſa <hi>alone,</hi> with a repetition of all thoſe words, which
fell from me, during the violence of my grief; and you may
judge by the greatneſſe of a paſſion which you are well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with, that there was, in the effects it produced,
but very little moderation. The night was now drawn neer,
when having recovered my ſtrength and ſpirits in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
I called for my cloaths which the Fiſher-men had taken
off to be dried, and began to find my ſelf in ſuch a condition,
that I would not by any perſwaſions be kept there any longer,
when good fortune, being then my Friend, directs to the
cottage where I was, a certain man, whom I knew to be
<hi>Telamon,</hi> a perſon that accompanied me in the quality of an
Eſquire. I immediately called him by his name, and the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Eſquire, tranſported with joy runs to me, and embracing
my knees, aſked me thouſands of times by what miracle I had
eſcaped; but inſtead of anſvvering him, I preſently aſked him
vvhat vvas become of the Princeſſe? <hi>Telamon,</hi> perceiving
with what earneſtneſſe I preſſed that queſtion to him ſeverall
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:97242:154"/>
times; <q>My Lord, <hi>ſaid he to me,</hi> aſſoon as the Pirate, by the
aſſiſtance of his men, was taken up out of the water, and
brought into the veſſell, finding himſelf in a poſture able
enough to purſue the deſigne he had undertaken, as having
been immediately recovered out of the water, he gave orders
to be ſet aſhore at a certain place he appointed to them, and
leaving the Princeſſe under the guard of his Lieutenant, he
left the veſſell with a ſelect number of his men, to ſeek out,
as they ſaid, a perſon that had made an eſcape the night
before, after ſhe had ſet his veſſell on fire; he commanded his
Lieutenant to have a care of the Princeſſe, and to expect
his return at a place where he appointed him. For my part,
having not the patience to ſtay any longer in the veſſell, I
thought it my beſt courſe to leave it, with a reſolution to
give you all the aſſiſtance I could if ſo be I found you capable
of any, or to take ſome order for your enterrement, in caſe I
ſhould have found your body caſt up any where on theſe
ſhores. Whereupon I came away with the Pirates, with
<hi>Zenodorus's</hi> leave, after I had caſt my ſelf at his feet begging
his permiſſion to look after the body of my Maſter, to do it
the laſt honours it were capable of.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>So that it ſeems then, <hi>ſaid I interrupting him,</hi> my Princeſſe
is yet about the river, where ſhe is to expect the returne of
the Pirate, and that <hi>Zenodorus</hi> is come aſhore upon this coaſt,
and is not yet returned to his ſhips.</q> 
                        <q>I can aſſure you, My
lord, <hi>replied he,</hi> that he is not yet returned, and that he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
by what I have underſtood, to beſtow all the next day
to find out the perſon that is eſcaped from him, and that it
is impoſſible he ſhould have met with her ſince we came
aſhore.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This account of <hi>Telamon</hi> filled me again with new hopes, as
reſolved, that if I could meet with the Pirate, what number
ſoever of men he might have about him, I would either die
in the engagement with him, or force him to returne the
Princeſſe, out of a certain confidence, that either gods or men
might afford me ſome aſſiſtance to carry on my enterpriſe.
In order thereto, knowing that we were not far from <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi>
where might eaſily be procured all things that were
neceſſary, <hi>I</hi> gave <hi>Telamon</hi> ſome of the jewells <hi>I</hi> ordinarily
carried about me, and which the Fiſhermen had not, as good
Fortune would have it, taken out of my cloaths, when they
dried them, and commanded him to make all the haſt he
could to the City, and buy two horſes, charging him, by all
meanes, to make choice for me of the beſt he could meet
with all, what rate ſoever he might be ſet at. To which
having further enjoined him to bring them me aſſoon as he
poſſibly could, and to give notice that night to the Praetor
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:97242:155"/>
of <hi>Alexandria</hi> of the arrivall of the Pirates upon the coaſt,
and the carrying away of the Princeſſe, I diſmiſſed him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Telamon,</hi> with theſe orders, took his way towards <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi>
while I remained, with ſome little hope to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
among the Fiſher-men, who would needs force me to
take what poor entertainment they could afford me; and
certainly; that nights reſt was no more then neceſſary for me,
to recover my ſtrength, and put me into a condition to be
able to deale with thoſe enemies which <hi>I</hi> ſhould meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
But why ſhould <hi>I</hi> ſpin out my relation to ſuch a length?
In a word, the next day about an houre after Sun-riſing, <hi>I</hi>
ſaw <hi>Telamon</hi> coming with two horſes. So that having put on
my Armour and beſtowed ſome of thoſe jewells I had left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Fiſher-men, I got up on the better of the horſes,
which I found, much to my content, very fit for my turn;
and having underſtood from <hi>Telamon</hi> that the Praetor had
notice given him, and was ſending out veſſels to the relief
of the Princeſſe, I reſolved to make a ſearch all about <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria.</hi>
During all that day, it ran ſtill in my thoughts, that
the onely way for me to relieve you, Madam, was, to meet
with <hi>Zenodorus,</hi> and to become maſter of his liberty as he was
of yours; and I thought it ſo much the more likely to be
effected, in regard that <hi>Telamon</hi> had aſſured me, that, the better
to find out the perſon he was in queſt of he had divided his men
into four parties, and conſequently had but very few about him.</p>
                     <p>I thought ſit in the firſt place to ride up and down the
ſhore and to viſit the woods, and all the places thereabouts,
eſpecially wherever I obſerved the track of any horſe. I had
ſpent in this manner the beſt part of the day to no purpoſe,
when croſſing through a pleaſant valley, and perceiving a little
rivulet, which took its riſe from a ſpring that was not far
off, the thirſt I then was in, occaſioned as well by reaſon of
the heat of the day, as the heavineſſe of my armour, obliged me
to alight, and to come to the ſpring, where happened that acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
which you may have had an account of from <hi>Cleomedon,</hi>
ſince you have already ſeen him. <hi>'Tis very true,</hi> replied the
Princeſſe Eliſa, <hi>we have ſo, and underſtood all the particulars
of your combat; and I knew not how to forbear blaming you, for
being ſo ready to give</hi> Cleomedon <hi>occaſion to come to blowes, ſince
you had no ground to hate him, nor did pretend any thing to the
Queen of</hi> Ethiopia.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Madam, <hi>replies Artaban,</hi> you may be pleaſed ſafely to aſſure
your ſelf as of nothing but truth, that the condition I was in
then was ſuch, that I had not any intention to engage <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
to ſight; but calling to mind the laſt words I had ſaid to
him at our parting, wherein I made a confident brag, that
I ſhould one day be in a condition to meaſure a weapon with
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:97242:155"/>
him without any prejudice to him, I thought my ſelf obliged
to put him in mind of it, out of a fear he might attribute
that forgetfullneſſe to any want of courage, and yet I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
all I could to expreſſe it in ſuch termes, as could not
have provoked him to fight, had he not been as forward as my
ſelfe.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whereupon <hi>Artaban,</hi> having briefly run over thoſe paſſages
which <hi>Caeſario</hi> had related before, acquainted them with what
had happened to him ſince <hi>Candace's</hi> being carried away in their
ſight the ſecond time; his engagement with <hi>Zenodorus's</hi> crue;
his retreat to the houſe of <hi>Tiridates,</hi> and the abode he had made
there, to their meeting at <hi>Tiridates's</hi> tomb.</p>
                     <p>He had juſt made an end of his diſcourſe, when <hi>Clitia</hi>
came to give them notice that <hi>Cleomedon</hi> was upon the Terrace,
and immediately after, he comes into the room with an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and majeſtick deportment. He had hardly acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of his ſalutations to the two Princeſſes, when <hi>Artaban,</hi> who
would needs do, with an obliging grace, whatever he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
he ought to do, comes up to him, and ſaluting him with
a civility animated by all the expreſſions of a reall greatneſſe of
ſoule; <q>Generous Cleomedon, <hi>ſaid he to him,</hi> I have forborn
too long from rendring you that which all men acknowledge
to be your due. Since you have overcome that unjuſt repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
which I had to do it, as well by the admirable ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
you are Maſter of, as by a late demonſtration of your
generoſity, give me leave to approach you with abundance of
remorſe for what is paſſed, abundance of reſpect for your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and a more than ordinary earneſtneſſe to deſerve ſome place
in your Friendſhip.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Caeſario,</hi> who was reſolved to have done that to <hi>Artaban</hi>
which <hi>Artaban</hi> had done to him, was ſomewhat troubled that
he had been prevented, and entertaining his diſcourſe and
action with a civility ſuitable to his; <q>The friendſhip you
proffer me, <hi>ſaid he to him,</hi> is a happineſſe of that concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that it was but juſt I ſhould purchaſe it with the price
of my blood, and as I could not charge any thing but my
own misfortune with the backwardneſſe you were in to afford
it me, before; ſo is it to my good fortune onely that I muſt
attribute the preſent you make me of it now.</q> 
                        <q>I conceive,
<hi>replied Artaban,</hi> that reſpect and eſteem which I have for you,
due to your vertue, your birth, and your excellent endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and the earneſtneſſe I have, freely and faithfully to
ſerve you, to the aſſiſtances you afforded me by your valour,
in delivering this great Princeſſe out of the hands of thoſe
that would have carried her away.</q> 
                        <q>It hath been no ſmall
ſatisfaction to me, <hi>replied Caeſario,</hi> that you were ſomething
concerned in the ſervice I have done the Princeſſe of the
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:97242:156"/>
                           <hi>Parthians,</hi> thought it were ſuch as ſhe might have received
from any man upon the like occaſion; but I have not forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the relief you gave me, when my horſe was killed under
me in the engagement againſt <hi>Zenodorus's</hi> men. However it
be, I conceive it a great happineſſe, that theſe mutuall civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
ſhould engage us to become faithfull friends, and I
promiſe, I ſhall never be found guilty of the leaſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of a friendſhip which I deſire may be eternall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>With theſe words, theſe two great perſons embraced one
another, upon the commands of the two Princeſſes (the reſpect
they had for them not permitting them to take that liberty in
their preſence) and a little after, they looked one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a mutuall admiration, and were both equally ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
as to the Friendſhip which they had contracted. <hi>Candace</hi>
who was infinitely pleaſed with it, ſpoke to them whatever
ſhe thought might any waies confirm them therein; and <hi>Eliſa,</hi>
who was extreamly ſenſible of the aſſiſtance which ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from <hi>Caeſario,</hi> joined her ſollicitations with the others,
to eſtabliſh a perfect union between thoſe two great men. But
they might very well have ſpared their endeavours to that
purpoſe; for the behaviour of theſe two great ſoules was ſo
mutually ingenuous and cordiall, that there was ſuch a prefect
conſonancy between their words and thoughts, that it might
be ſaid, their friendſhip was truely conſummate before they
had in a manner made the firſt overtures thereof.</p>
                     <p>Theſe foure illuſtrious perſons, all ſatisfied, though with
ſome inequality, would have fallen either together, or ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
into ſome pleaſant diſcourſe had not <hi>Candace</hi> be thought
her ſelf that the Princeſſe <hi>Cleopatra</hi> was not gone to bed, out
of an expectation to hear from them, and if ſhe had not had
a great deſire to make her acquainted with <hi>Caeſario</hi> that night.
Upon that reflection, having taken the Prince a little aſide (and
at the ſame time left <hi>Eliſa</hi> with <hi>Artaban</hi> in an affectionate and
pleaſant diſcourſe) ſhe diſcovered to him her deſires, that he
would make himſelf known to the Princeſſe his Siſter, to
whoſe prudence it were not unſafe to commit things of the
greateſt importance, and repeated to him all the diſcourſes
which ſhe had entertained her with, to prepare her
thereto.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Caeſario</hi> very willingly condeſcended to the propoſition of
<hi>Candace,</hi> as having already found it no ſmall difficulty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
himſelf from ſo amiable a Siſter, and having forborn it
upon no other account than the ſubmiſſion he had for the
Queen. <hi>Candace</hi> would have ſent word to <hi>Cleopatra</hi> of it; but
ſhe was a little troubled that <hi>Artaban</hi> ſhould be preſent, as not
conceiving, that <hi>Caeſario</hi> would, before him, declare a thing,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:97242:156"/>
the leaſt diſcovery whereof would infallibly coſt him his life.
She acquainted him with her thoughts to that purpoſe, and
adviſed with him what courſe ſhould be taken to have
things ſo carried as that <hi>Artaban</hi> might not be preſent at that
action. But <hi>Caeſario</hi>'s ſoul being too great to entertain the
leaſt diſtruſt of ſuch a perſon as <hi>Artaban,</hi> and upon the firſt
diſcovery the Queen made of her jealouſie, ſlighting that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution,
and lifting up his voice, purpoſely that he might be
heard by all that were in the Chamber: <hi>There is no neceſſity,
Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>of any ſuch circumſpection when we
have to deale with a vertue, ſuch as is that of</hi> Artabans. <hi>I
know him ſo well, as that I would truſt him with ſomething
more precious than my life, and therefore, ſince it is your pleaſure
we ſhould ſee</hi> Cleopatra, <hi>I ſhall diſcover my ſelf to her,
before</hi> Artaban, <hi>with as much confidence as before your
ſelfe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All that were preſent were infinitely pleaſed with the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
clearneſſe which <hi>Caſario</hi> expreſſed; and <hi>Artaban,</hi> who
had heard the words, and eaſily imagined the occaſion on
which they were ſpoken, willing to returne him an anſwer,
not unworthy the good opinion he had of him; <q>I muſt
needs confeſſe, <hi>ſaid he to him,</hi> that this demonſtration of
your generoſity is very great, wherein you are content to
make a diſcovery of your ſelf to me, which, among per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
of whoſe faith you were doubtfull, might prove pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
to your ſafety; and I receive, with the reſentment
I ought, a confidence, whereto I have not any waies ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
you. But that you may be ſatisfied, that I am not
abſolutely unworthy of it, and that you need not fear I
ſhould abuſe it, now that you have aſſured me of your
friendſhip, I am to let you know, that, even during that
time, wherein I had the greateſt averſion for, nay, in the
time of youth, which is not ordinarily over-apt to keep a
ſecret, I have known your name and birth, and that you will
not tell me any thing I know not, when you ſhall diſcover your
ſelf to the Princeſſe your Siſter to be <hi>Caeſario,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Caefar</hi>
and <hi>Cleopatra.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This diſcourſe of <hi>Artabans,</hi> little expected by <hi>Caeſario,</hi>
raiſed in him ſome aſtoniſhment, and might have put <hi>Candace</hi> into
ſome jealouſie of <hi>Eliſa,</hi> had ſhe not immediately called to mind
to ſome words which <hi>Artaban</hi> had ſaid to her, when they
met at <hi>Tiridates's</hi> Tomb, whence ſhe might have imagined,
that the birth and true name of <hi>Caeſario</hi> were not unknown
to him. The Prince, upon this new expreſſion of true friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
could not but admire the great courage of <hi>Artaban,</hi>
who, notwithſtanding the ſtrange averſion he had ever diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
towards him, and that in an age which is not much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:97242:157"/>
to the moderation of the moſt violent paſſions, had
ſlighted the opportunity he had to prejudice his enemy, and
obſerved that ſecrecy towards him, which he would not,
without ſome difficulty, have found, even among his friends.
And certainly his aſtoniſhment had been the greater at this
kind of proceeding, if theſe characters of an elevated ſoule
had been leſſe familiar to him, and if he had not found
in himſelfe an inclination to do the like towards <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taban.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>However, he thought it but juſt to let <hi>Artaban</hi> know
what eſteem and acknowledgment he conceived at ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
a carriage, and looking on him with an action, which in
ſome meaſure expreſſed what his thoughts were employed
about; <q>I muſt needs confeſſe, <hi>ſaid he to him,</hi> that all things
are admirably great in you, and that it will be a great
injuſtice in fortune, if ſhe raiſe you not above Kings, ſince
they are things you can pull down when you pleaſe.
There are few perſons certainly would have made ſo little
advantage as you have done, of a diſcovery, which might
have proved ſo prejudicial to me in the world; but there are
yet fewer would have effected thoſe great things which are in
you the accompliſhments of your generous beginnings. But,
may I preſume to aſk you, by what adventure you ſhould
come to the knowledge of that which all the World was
ignorant of?</q> 
                        <q>A young man that had ſometime been a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of yours, <hi>replied Artaban,</hi> and who ſince, as I have been
informed, was killed in one of the battles which you fought
in <hi>Nubia,</hi> having for me a very particular friendſhip revealed
that ſecret to me, and there needed no more then the illuſtrious
characters I obſerved in your perſon to ſatisfie me that he
told nothing but what was truth.</q> 
                        <q>If thoſe characters are able
to work that effect, <hi>ſaid Caeſario to him,</hi> I muſt needs imagine
you to be the iſſue of the gods; and though you are not pleaſed
to derive any recommendation from a birth, which you do not
ſtand in need of to make you equal to the greateſt Princes that
are, yet can I hardly be perſwaded but that yours is of the moſt
eminent.</q> 
                        <hi>Artaban</hi> would have made ſome modeſt return to this
diſcourſe, when the Princeſſe <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> whom <hi>Candace</hi> had ſent
for, comes into the room, the Princeſſes having not thought it fit
that ſhe ſhould receive <hi>Caeſario's</hi> viſit in her own, becauſe of her
women, to whom there was no neceſſity he ſhould diſcover
himſelf.</p>
                     <p>The room, upon her coming into it, ſeemed to be filled with a
new light, which dazled both <hi>Artaban</hi> and <hi>Caeſario,</hi> and though
one of them had ſeen her that very day before, and that the other
were her brother, and had ſpent his childhood with her, and that,
to ſay better, they were both of them prepoſſed by a paſſion,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:97242:157"/>
which till then had not permitted them to imagine anything in
point of beauty comparable to <hi>Eliſa</hi> and <hi>Candace,</hi> yet could they
not ſmother the aſtoniſhment which they conceived upon this
ſight, nor but acknowledge, though with ſome confuſion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance,
that all the beauties upon earth ought to give place to
that of <hi>Cleopatra. Caeſario,</hi> tranſported with the affection which
the bloud and merit of that Princeſſe, inſpired him with, could
upon the firſt ſight hardly forbear making diſcoveries thereof;
but upon ſecond thoughts he reſolved to proceed after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manner, and to make that adventure contribute ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to the diverſion and entertainment of thoſe that were
preſent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cleopatra</hi> was hardly gotten into <hi>Eliſas</hi> chamber, ere word was
brought her that Prince <hi>Alexander,</hi> her brother, was come into
her own, and that having left the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> he thought
not fit to depart the lodgings till he had wiſhed her a good night.
<hi>Cleopatra</hi> was going to ſend the Meſſenger back again with word
that he ſhould ſtay a while for her, when Queen <hi>Candace,</hi> who
knew it was <hi>Caeſario's</hi> deſign, to diſcover himſelf, as well to
<hi>Alexander,</hi> as <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> entreated her to ſend for him, aſſuring
her that there was none had the leaſt miſtruſt of him, and
that <hi>Cleomedon</hi> was too much engaged by the aſſiſtance he
had received from him to deny him the opportunity to ſee
him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> having done what the Queen deſired of her,
ſaluted <hi>Caeſario</hi> and <hi>Artaban,</hi> with that ceremony which ſhe
conceived ſhe ought to have obſerved towards two ſuch emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
men, and of whom ſhe had her imagination full, by
the account had been given her of their gallant actions.
She looked on them one after another, with a certain
aſtoniſhment, as not knowing any one in the World whom
ſhe could think comparable to them, but onely her own
<hi>Coriolanus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They were going to fall into ſome diſcourſe, when there
comes into the room <hi>Alexander,</hi> upon the firſt ſight, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
at a loſſe to find that company there. <hi>Artaban</hi> and
he had ſpent the evening together with <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> and it
was not long ſince they had parted, after they had conceived,
(conſidering the ſmall abode they had made together) abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of eſteem and reſpects one for another. But the ſight of
<hi>Cleomedon,</hi> was it, that he was moſt aſtoniſhed at; and, having
not ſeen him ſince he had left <hi>Tidaeus</hi>'s houſe in purſuit of
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> he wondred much to find him in the ſame room
with her. Yet was not his aſtoniſhment ſo great, but that
he expreſſed the ſatisfaction he conceived it to meet with him;
and after he had in the firſt place addreſſed his civilities to
<hi>Eliſa</hi> and <hi>Candace,</hi> with much ſubmiſſion, he came to him,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:97242:158"/>
to let him know how glad he was to find him in a condition
ſo different from that wherein he had left him, and craved
his pardon, that, by reaſon of the urgent neceſſity that had
called him away to the reliefe of <hi>Artemiſa</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra,</hi>
he had been forced to leave him, and to recommend to
other perſons the recovery of a health which he infinitely
eſteemed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Caeſario</hi> thought this diſcourſe ſo obliging, that he could
not but make an anſwer ſuitable thereto; whereupon looking
on <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra</hi> with an affection, which blood,
obligation, and merit, had eaſily raiſed in him; <q>No, it is I, <hi>ſaid
he to the Prince,</hi> that ought, with much more reaſon, make my
excuſes to you; and had you afforded me the time to put
my ſelf into ſuch a poſture as that I might have followed you,
the indiſpoſition I might have been in by reaſon of my wounds,
ſhould not have excuſed me, for not bearing of you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
to relieve the Princeſſe <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> That was an
affair, which I was more particularly obliged to look after,
then you could have imagined; and beſides the engagement
I ſtand in to the aſſiſtance I received from you, when my
life was in greateſt danger, the remembrance of a perſon whom
you have ſometimes eſteemed, and of whom I have underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to bring ſome tidings to the Princeſſe <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and your
ſelf, makes me concern my ſelf in your intereſts, with a very vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
affection.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>It is very true, <hi>replyed the Princeſſe</hi> Cleopatra, that the Queen
hath put me into very much hope that I ſhould receive by you
ſome account of a perſon I have ſometime dearly loved,
and it is out of that confidence, that ſhe hath been pleaſed
I ſhould come to her Chamber at ſuch a time that it may
be ſome inconvenience to her. I muſt needs confeſſe that
this promiſe of the Queens hath raiſed in me a curioſity
which is more then ordinary to me, as well out of the
imagination I have, that, from a great perſon, ſuch as you
are, I ſhall underſtand onely great things, as out of a ſelf-flattery
I have been guilty of that it might be of a Beloved
brother, a perſon of excellent endowments, whom an amorous
deſpair, forced from <hi>Rome</hi> about ſeven or eight years ſince,
that you have ſomething to ſay to me. We are to learn whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be dead or living, and it is not impoſſible, but that in
his travels he might have met with you, and been of your
acquaintance.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>I am very much troubled, Madam, <hi>replied the Prince,</hi>
that it is not in my power to give you the ſatisfaction you
expected from me; for as to that brother you enquire of,
I have not certainly any account to give you of him, nay,
which is more, I never know him. But I may haply have
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:97242:158"/>
what to acquaint you with concerning ſome other perſons of
your houſe, who were no leſſe dear to you, and whom I
have heretofore familiarly ſeen and converſed with in this
City, before the ruine of <hi>Anthony,</hi> and Queen <hi>Cleopatra.</hi>
And that you may be the ſooner convinced, obſerve well
my face, and ſee, whether, notwithſtanding the change which
ten years may have wrought in it, you can find ſome features
like to thoſe of that perſon, who was brought up with you, and
whom you dearly loved. I have been heretofore flattered by
ſome with that reſemblance, and know not whether you have
preſerved the idaea of it ſo well, as to find there is yet ſomething
left of it.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe words raiſed no ſmall aſtoniſhment in the children of
<hi>Anthony,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> coming up cloſe to <hi>Caeſario,</hi> was was
purpoſely got neer the torches, <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and he looked on
him a long time with much earneſtneſſe. It was about the
tenth year of their age that <hi>Caeſario</hi> departed from <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
and about the fourteenth of his own, ſo that, by reaſon, as
well of the infancy of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> as the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
which (more remarkably then in any other degree of
mans age) happens in the countenances of men between that
of fourteen, and that of four and twenty, which was then the
age of <hi>Caeſario,</hi> it might well happen, that the Princeſſe, and
the Prince her Brother, could not, upon the firſt ſight, diſcover
the face of their Brother, in that of <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> whoſe ſpeech,
proportionably to the reſt, was altered, by growing bigger
ſince their ſeparation. Yet was not all this alteration ſo great,
nor their memories ſo weak, but that after what <hi>Cleomedon</hi> had
ſaid, and the particular obſervation which he had obliged
them to make, they would have known the Prince, had they
not been carried away with the general opinion, that he had
departed this World. Nay, after they had well conſidered
his face, they, in a manner, knew him; but that diſcovery
had no further effect on them, then to force out certain
ſighes; whereupon the Princeſſe <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> aſſuming the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
after ſhe had looked on <hi>Alexander,</hi> to ſee whether he
was of the ſame opinion: <q>I muſt needs acknowledge, <hi>ſaid
ſhe to the Prince,</hi> that I find abundance of reſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
your countenance, and that of a Prince, with whom
my Brother and my ſelf were brought up, and one that
might have been much about your age, if the gods had
thought fit to have continued him in life and health, and to
preſerve him againſt thoſe powers, by which he received an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely
death.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>I am alſo very much ſatisfied, <hi>added Prince Alexander,</hi> that
if out Brother <hi>Caeſario</hi> were living, he might be very like
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:97242:159"/>
the brave <hi>Cleomedon.</hi> And thought that from the age of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years, which was that of <hi>Caeſario,</hi> when he dyed, to
that of <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> which ſeems to be greater by nine or ten
years, there happens more alteration, both in the bulk and
countenances of men, then in all mans life beſides, and that
it might be withal granted, that time may in ſome meaſure
have worn away, out of our memories, thoſe Idaeas, which
cannot be expected otherwiſe then imperfect in the minds
of children, ſuch as we were then; yet can I not call them
to my remembrance, without a certain conceit that I find
them again in <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> and imagining to my ſelf, that, if
<hi>Caeſario</hi> were now alive, there would be a very great reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
between them. Nay, I am much inclined to believe,
from the great hopes that were conceived of him, and the
glorious bloud that ran in his veines, derived from illuſtrious
anceſtors, that this reſemblance might have reached to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of courage, and that he would have thought it a diſhonour
to come too far ſhort of that ſtupendous man, whom it was his
glory to imitate in all things.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The modeſty of the ſon of <hi>Caeſario,</hi> made him bluſh at theſe
obliging expreſſions of the ſon of <hi>Anthony;</hi> whereupon, looking
on him with a ſmiling countenance, <q>It is but juſt indeed I
ſhould ſuffer any thing, <hi>ſaid he to him,</hi> from a Prince to
whom I am obliged for an aſſiſtance that preſerved my life.
But ſince you and the Princeſſe <hi>Cleopatra</hi> are pleaſed to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
me ſo pleaſantly, with ſo advantageous a reſemblance, I
muſt in requittal aſſure you, that it is yet greater in all
things then you imagine it, and that I am not onely, as to my
inclinations, comparable to Prince <hi>Caeſario,</hi> but alſo that my
fortunes have been abſolutely ſuitable to his. I ſhould put
you to ſome aſtoniſhment, ſhould I tell you, that, as he, ſo I
was dearly loved by <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra</hi> in their younger
years: That I was loved as tenderly as he was by the Queen
your mother, and that her indulgence towards me was as
great as what ſhe expreſſed towards him; that as he, ſo I
alſo left you to ſeek out my ſafty in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> after the
downfall of your houſe; That I was born as well as he of
an unfortunate Queen, and am ſon to the greateſt that ever
was of mankind; and, in a word, I am ſo extreamly like
him, that I might even in <hi>Alexandria</hi> preſume to own
the name of <hi>Caeſario,</hi> if by ſuch an acknowledegment I
ſhould not put you to the hazard of looſing him once
again.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe words of <hi>Caeſario</hi> raiſed ſuch a diſtraction in the ſouls
of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> that neither of them being able to
comprehend any thing of it, could do no more then look on
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:97242:159"/>
him that had ſpoke them, with a ſilence which argued their
aſtoniſhment, much more then any verbal expreſſions could have
done. The ſonne of <hi>Caeſar</hi> had ſuffered them to coninue a
while in that poſture, when he ſees <hi>Eteocles</hi> coming, in whom he
had cauſed <hi>Clitia</hi> to call from the Terrace, where he had left
him. Whereupon, reaſſuming the diſcourſe with an action which
held the Brother and the Siſter equally in ſuſpence; <q>That you
may be abſolutely ſatisfied, <hi>ſaid he to them,</hi> that my fortunes
have been in all things conformable to thoſe of <hi>Caeſario,</hi> behold
the man that brought me up, and who preſumes that he hath
been of the ſame name, was of the ſame Birth, ſame Country, and
ſame countenance as the Governour of <hi>Caeſario.</hi> If you look
on him with more earneſtneſs then you have done for ſome daies
paſt, when he was with you in that very houſe where I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
your aſſiſtances, you will eaſily obſerve that reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance,
and he is a perſon of ſuch an age, as wherein ten
years cannot make ſo great an alteration, as they may in
that wherein one paſſes from infancy to a more advanced
age.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>While he thus ſpoke, the eies of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> were
fixed on the countenance of <hi>Eteocles,</hi> and it being very certain
that it had undergone much leſſe alteration then that of the
Prince, they immediately found therein all the features of
that of <hi>Eteocles,</hi> with whom they had ſometime been ſo fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar,
as having been one that had carryed them thouſands of
times in his arms, and had been brought up in the houſe, as ſon
to the faithfull <hi>Apollodorus,</hi> the dear favorite and confident of
Queen <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> Whereupon both the Prince and Princeſſe
cryed out, that it was really <hi>Eteocles,</hi> and immediately turning to
the Prince with an aſtoniſhment much greater then what they
were in before, by reaſon of this laſt circumſtance: <hi>Cleomedon,</hi>
ſaid the Princeſſe to him, <hi>for heavens ſake, keep us not
any longer in the diſturbance which you have raiſed in us,
and let us know that</hi> Caeſario <hi>is living, to tell us ſo
much himſelf. Tis onely his death that abates that confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
which we raiſe from all the other circumſtances, and if</hi>
Caeſario <hi>were living, I ſhould be immediately ſatiefied that you
were he.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Should he diſcover himſelf to be <hi>Caeſario,</hi> in any place that
is under the juriſdiction of <hi>Auguſtus, replyed the Princeſſe,</hi>
there is ſo little expectation of any Fortune thereby, that it
were hard to ſuſpect ſuch a confeſſion ſubject to any impoſture:
but it is withall a thing ſo glorious to be born of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> without an exceſſe of baſeneſſe, a man cannot
diſclaime it, and there is ſo much ſatisfaction to <hi>Caeſario,</hi> to
meet with a Brother and Siſter, great and amiable as <hi>Alexander</hi>
                        <pb n="314" facs="tcp:97242:160"/>
and <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> that no conſideration in the World can oblige him
any longer to conceale from them, a brother they have dearly
loved, and one that hath continued towards them the tender affection
he ever had for them.</p>
                     <p>With theſe words, he came neer <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> with his arms
ſtretched out, and that fair Princeſſe ſoon ſatisfied thoſe that
were preſent, that ſhe knew him to be her brother, by receiving
from him, and returning him thoſe careſſes which never had
paſſed between her and any, but thoſe that were of that neer
relation. <hi>Alexander</hi> alſo received and returned the like, by
the command of <hi>Eliſa</hi> and <hi>Candace,</hi> whoſe preſence obliged
them to a greater reſervedneſſe. But, notwithſtanding all that
bloud might perſwade the children of <hi>Anthony</hi> to, and the
joy it muſt needs be to them to meet with a loſt brother, in
the perſon of ſo great a man as <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> yet was not all
enough to diſpell their aſtoniſhment, and this adventure ſeemed
to be ſo great, and ſo full of miracle, that to be fully ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
it was but neceſſary they had the aſſiſtance of <hi>Candace,
Eliſa</hi> and <hi>Eteocles,</hi> who very freely acquainted them with
the ſecret of <hi>Caeſario</hi>'s life: for as to the great actions he
had done under the name of <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> they were in
ſome meaſure known to <hi>Alexander,</hi> and abſolutely to <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra,</hi>
by the relation which <hi>Candace</hi> had made thereof
to her.</p>
                     <p>When they were fully convinced of theſe truths, their joy
diſcovered it ſelf by all the effects it could produce in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
and affectionate diſpoſitions, as theirs were; and it had
not haply been greater, though they had ſeen this very bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
returning in that pomp and magnificence, which he
might have hoped from his former fortune, when, even in
his infancy he had been proclaimed <hi>King of Kings,</hi> by the
commands of <hi>Anthony,</hi> and Queen <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> Then was it
that <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> notwithſtanding all her reſervedneſſe and modeſty,
could not forbear entertaining ſo great a brother with em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
ſit to be envyed by all men; and that <hi>Alexander</hi> expreſſed
the agitations of his heart, by the moſt earneſt demonſtrations,
that a ſincere affection could produce in a noble ſoule as his
was.</p>
                     <p>It was alſo during theſe pleaſant intervalls that the fair
daughter of <hi>Anthony,</hi> giving thouſands of kiſſes to the Queen of
<hi>Ethiopia,</hi> gave her infinite thanks, with tears, which the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
of joy and affection drew from her fair eies, for his
preſervation, and for the preſent ſhe made her of ſo great a
brother, and thence took occaſion to celebrate her generoſity,
and the extraordinary goodneſſe ſhe had expreſſed, in beſtowing
her precious affections on a Prince whom fortune had not left
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:97242:160"/>
any thing ſhe could have taken away from him, and raiſing
him up to a Crown whereby he might recover himſelf into
the dignity of his Fathers. <hi>What,</hi> ſaid Alexander, <hi>is that
invincible</hi> Cleomedon, <hi>who gained ſo many battles in</hi> Nubia,
<hi>and whoſe reputation, notwithſtanding the interpoſition of ſo
many Provinces, eclipſed the glory of our moſt famous Captains,
no other then the ſame</hi> Caſario, <hi>on whom, in our infancy, we
had beſtowed ſo many tears, and in that dead Brother, do we
recover again a Brother, whoſe glory may darken that of his
Father?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the firſt demonſtrations of this happy reacquaintance
were over, they all joined together in a more moderate
converſation; ſo that <hi>Artaban</hi> taking occaſion to expreſſe
his concernments in the joy of <hi>Cleopatras</hi> children, no leſſe
then if he had been of the ſame Bloud, made them conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with a certain admiration, that character of greatneſſe,
which the gods had put upon him. They thought it no ill
courſe to moderate the diſcoveries of their joy, out of a
fear the cauſe might come to be known; which if it ſhould
happen, it could not be without bringing <hi>Caeſario's</hi> life into
in minent danger. And conſidering withall that the night
was in a manner quite ſpent, and that ſuch long ſittings up
might, in time, raiſe ſome ſuſpicions, the deſire which the
Princeſſe <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> had to enjoy yet for
ſome longer time, that happy re-acquaintance, and that
which <hi>Caeſario</hi> had to underſtand the fortunes of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi>
whereof he had but an imperfect account, were not ſo
great, but that, though not without ſome violence done
to themſelves, they appointed it to be the entertainment
of the night following, thoſe that were concerned in
the ſafty of <hi>Caeſario,</hi> thinking it not ſo ſafe to truſt it to
the day.</p>
                     <p>They parted therefore, though with much unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra</hi> were extreamly troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
that the ſonne of <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould take his retreat, in
a lone houſe not much frequented, which <hi>Eteocles</hi> had
provided for him in one of the moſt ſolitary ſkirts of
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> as conceiving there would be leſſe notice
taken of his going in and out there, then in that of <hi>Tidaeus</hi>
without the City, where he had ſpent ſome dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                     <p>But before they parted, <hi>Artaban</hi> and <hi>Caeſario</hi> confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the reconciliation they had made, by words full of
the greateſt expreſſions of a real friendſhip, and recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
promiſed one another all the aſſiſtances, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the poſture of their fortunes, they ſhould be able
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:97242:161"/>
to afford one the other. The two Princeſſes they ſerved,
were extreamly ſatisfied thereat, and when they were
alone, the Daughter of <hi>Anthony</hi> paſſing to her own lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
they went into their beds, to crown the extraordinary
accidents of that day with a pleaſant reſt.</p>

THe fortunate meeting with a Brother, ſuch as
<hi>Caeſario</hi> was, had raiſed in the Princeſſe <hi>Cleopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi>
ſuch a ſatisfaction, as, ſince the imaginary
infidelity of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> ſhe had not been capable
of, whence it came, that ſhe paſſed over that
night with more delight, and took more reſt
than the precedent. Now, as the beſt part of the night was
ſpent ere ſhe lay down, ſo was it accordingly very late ere ſhe
awoke in the morning, inſomuch that thoſe who knew not any
thing of her long ſitting up, would not have a little won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
ſhe had ſlept ſo long, had they not imagined that
the trouble and hardſhip ſhe had gone through, for ſome
daies before, might require a more than ordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                     <p>'Tis a common obſervation, that, it is ordinarily at our wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in the morning, we make the moſt naturall reflections on
the conditions and accidents of our lives. She accordingly had
no ſooner opened her eies but the Idaea of her late adventures
preſented it ſelf to her remembrance, and as ſhe was of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
good nature, ſo that ſympathy which her meeting with
<hi>Caeſario</hi> had raiſed in her mind, was the firſt effect that was
produced there. Her thoughts were, with no ſmall ſatisfaction,
taken up with that fortunate rencounter, as looking on it as a
thing extreamly advantageous, to find a Brother, whom ſhe
thought dead ſo many yeares before, changed into a Brother ſo
great, ſo amiable, and ſo conſiderable, as well for his vertue, as
the greatneſſe of his actions. She reflected on the noble acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of his life, the ſtrange Fortunes he had run through, and
fixed her conſideration on the preſent poſture of his affaires,
which in all probability was ſuch as promiſed him a ſafe harbour
againſt all thoſe tempeſts whereby he had been toſſed up and
down for the ſpace of ſo many yeares, and ſeemed to be an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment,
ſuch as gave him not any occaſion to envy that of
his Anceſtors. The conſideration of her Brothers concernments
had that effect on her which it might be expected they might
have on the beſt ſiſter in the world, and ſtruck her thoughts
with ſo much delight, that for ſome time ſhe could hardly make
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:97242:163"/>
any reflection on her own: but at laſt ſhe could not keep them
off any longer, but they muſt needs do a violence to her memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and the Idaea of her unfortunate <hi>Coriolanus</hi> preſented it ſelf
to her in the ſame poſture as ſhe had ſeen him the day before.
Her firſt imaginations repreſented him to her in that terrible
poſture, wherein he had forced out of the veſſell thoſe that
fought for her deliverance: but there being not ſo much ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
in this, as in the reflection on the other accidents that

faſtened her thoughts more than any, as deſiring not ſo much any
aſſurances of the valour of <hi>Coriolanus</hi> (whereof ſhe had ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
experience) as of his innocency, whereof ſhe had been ſo
long in doubt, and whereof either the certainty or uncertainty
occaſioned all the happineſſe or unhappineſſe of her life. She
had ſo well engraven in her memory all the words which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ell
from that poor Prince, that, notwithſtanding the diſturbance ſhe
had been in, while he had ſpoken them, there had not ſo much
as one ſlipped out of her remembrance. And finding them all
very pregnant and full of conviction, it was a certain imaginary
pleaſure to her to be in a manner perſwaded, that it muſt needs
be innocence and truth that put them into the mouth of that
Prince, to convince her of that errour, wherein ſhe had paſſed
over ſo many ſad daies. Alaſſe! with what ſatisfaction, and with
what tenderneſſe did ſhe repeat them over and over, and how
did ſhe make it her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ain buſineſſe to heighten thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
that any way made for him? All indeed were very ſtrong
for him, from the time that ſhe firſt opened her eies to truth,
and the diſcoveries of that pretended infidelity; and ſhe could
not but acknowledge her credulity, in having too eaſily been
perſwaded to a belief of things, that were contrary to reaſon
and common ſence. She could not find the leaſt favourable
imagination to perſwade her that <hi>Coriolanus</hi> ſhould fall in love
with <hi>Julia,</hi> being then abſent from her, when, even in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and during the time that ſhe expreſſed a great aflection
towards him, he had ever ſlighted her, and that the Prince ſhould
ſo much court the friendſhip of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> ſhe thought yet more
improbable, and that he ſhould proffer himſelf to be tributary
to him, when he had by open hoſtility recovered a powerfull
Monarchy; when he had refuſed the ſame friendſhip, at a time
when he was not maſter of any thing but his ſword, and could
not expect any thing but by his meanes and aſſiſtance. She called
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:97242:163"/>
to mind in what termes he had vindicated himſelf with ſo much
apparent reaſon, and found ſo much eviction in all, that
there needed not much, abſolutely to juſtifie him in her appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion.</p>
                     <p>During theſe pleaſant intervalls ſhe opened her ſoule to give
admiſſion to that joy, which, of a long time before, could never
have the leaſt entertainment there, but it was at the ſame time
very much abated, by a cold reflection on the miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to which that Prince was reduced, as having loſt the
Kingdomes he had conquered, and being deprived of all ſupport
and relief in the world, through her inflexibility towards him.
Theſe reflections, equally divided between grief and joy, drew
many a ſigh out of her breaſt, and this was the entertainment
of her thoughts, all the time ſhe lay in bed after her awaking, and
while ſhe was dreſſing.</p>
                     <p>She was juſt upon the point of going out of her chamber, to
go into that of <hi>Candace's</hi> (whom ſhe now looked on as a Siſter
to whom ſhe was engaged for the life and fortunes of her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and who, as well as the Princeſſe of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> had lain
longer in bed then ſhe had) when Prince <hi>Marcellus</hi> comes to
give her a good morrow. <hi>Cleopatra</hi> entertained him as a belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Brother, but what confidence ſoever ſhe might have of his
prudence and generoſitie, yet did ſhe not think it fit to truſt him
with the ſecret of another, though ſhe had with her own, and
ſo made not the leaſt mention to him of <hi>Caeſario,</hi> though ſhe had
not the leaſt jealouſie, that any conſideration whatſoever might
induce <hi>Marcellus</hi> to do him any ill office. This Prince, after the
firſt civilities were paſt, being ſate down by her; <q>Siſter, <hi>ſaid
he to her,</hi> I am to acknowledge to you, that during all this
night, the Idaea of the diſconſolate <hi>Coriolanus</hi> never forſook
me, and that I have ſpent the greateſt part of it in finding out,
as well in his actions, as his words, an innocency whereof I am
more then half convinced. This Prince, who was ſometime
ſo dear to me, and whom it is not yet in my power to hate,
comes and engages my heart with the ſame armes, whereby
he had ſo well maſtered it before, and methinks I find again,
not onely in his countenance, but alſo in his words and all his
actions, that greatneſſe of ſoule which we ever obſerved in
him, and withall that confidence which never appeares where
there is a certainty of crime; and of all this I am ſo
much aſſured, that I cannot, without an extraordinary vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,

will be pleaſed to grant an houre of private audience to a certain

                     </p>
                     <p>This diſcourſe of <hi>Cornelius</hi> made <hi>Cleopatra</hi> look on <hi>Marcellus,</hi>

                        <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and <hi>Marcellus</hi> knew not, upon the firſt appearance,
who it might be; but afterwards, having looked a little more
earneſtly on his countenance, they, without much difficulty, knew
him to be <hi>Voluſius,</hi> who had ſometime been Praetor of <hi>Mauritania,</hi>
before it had been recovered from him by <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> the ſon of
<hi>Juba,</hi> whom that Prince had generouſly ſent back, after he had
overcome and taken him Priſoner, and who, upon his coming to
<hi>Rome,</hi> had ruined the fortunes of that Prince, as to <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> by
acquainting that Princeſſe, <hi>Marcellus</hi> and all <hi>Caeſars</hi> Court, with
the pretended infidelity of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> and the deſign he had for
<hi>Julia,</hi> and preſenting to the Emperour a perſon of eminent
quality, very conſiderable in <hi>Mauritania;</hi> who gave out that he
was come thence expreſſe upon that negotiation. <hi>Marcellus</hi> was
a little aſtoniſhed at the ſight of the man, whoſe miſchievous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
had brought him to very ſad extremities: but the Princeſſe
was put into ſuch a diſturbance upon the return of a man, who
had been the deſtruction of all her happineſſe and enjoyments,
that, having not the power to riſe off the chair whereon ſhe ſate,
though ſhe ſhould in civility have done it, out of a conſideration
of the qualities of <hi>Cornelius</hi> and <hi>Voluſius,</hi> ſhe ſate ſtill, as it were

                     <p>
                        <hi>Voluſius</hi> took very much notice of her deportment, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity

and during the trouble <hi>Cleopatra</hi> was in, thought fit to
do the civilities of her chamber, he made a ſign to <hi>Cornelius,</hi>
whereupon, knowing his meaning, he went out of the chamber, to
give them the greater privacy, and withal thought it not amiſſe
to divert the viſits of <hi>Eliſa, Candace,</hi> and other perſons that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
might have diſturbed their converſation. <hi>Voluſius,</hi> being in

to ſpeak, and ſeeing about the Princeſſe onely <hi>Camilla,</hi> who
had obliged the reſt of the women to withdraw into the cloſet, and
who might be admitted to hear the diſcourſe he was to make;
<q>Madam, <hi>ſaid he, ſpeaking to the Princeſſe,</hi> I ſhould ſpeak to you

committed againſt you, I ſhould caſt my ſelf at your feet, to
to beg a pardon from you which I neither hope nor deſerve to
obtain, were I not diſabled by two wounds I have about me,
ſuch as have hardly left me the ſtrength to come to you, and
which will prove, for ought I know, a certain revenge for the
injury I have done you. Onely my remorſe, and the promiſe
I have made to do it, force me to diſcover to you things that
ought rather to be concealed from all the World; and though
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:97242:165"/>
I muſt introduce into my diſcourſe, perſons, whoſe power is much
to be feared; yet ſhall I not forbear, ſince that within a few
daies, I ſhall either be in a condition not to fear it, or, if the
gods think good to continue my life, I am more willing to ſee it
expoſed to ſome danger by my confeſſion, then be perpetually

                        <p>WE are ſatisfied by experience, that both the
remembrance of good turns, and that of
injuries, have a different operation, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the different character of thoſe ſouls
where they are entertained, and that, as there
are ſome minds wherein offences make but a
very light impreſſion, much lighter then that which good offices
might make in them, ſo, on the other ſide, there are ſome, in
whom the greateſt benefits cannot ſmother the leaſt injuries, or,
to ſay better, who, not much ſenſible of obligations laid upon
them, have nevertheleſſe eternal reſentments for injuries. That
I have been worſted and diſgraced by Prince <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> I muſt
attribute it meerly to his valour and my own unhappineſſe, and
that I was nobly treated by him, it was the effect of his pure
generoſity: and yet the impreſſion of the injury filled my ſoul in
ſuch manner, that it leaves not any place for that which the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
entertainment ſhould have had there, and oppoſed the
reſentment it ſhould have conceived thereof, that ſo I might
be the more abſolutely hurried into contrary reſolutions.</p>
                        <p>I doubt not, Madam, but you have heard, how that, having been
ſeveral times defeated in the perſons of my Lieutenants, I was at
laſt overthrown in my own, and, through the valour of the ſon of
<hi>Juba,</hi> having loſt a battel, which in all probability I ſhould have
gained, I was by the ſame valour caſt to the ground, and taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner.
You have alſo further underſtood, how that after ſome
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:97242:166"/>
daies impriſonment, ſuch as was ſweetned by all the kind enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments
which I could have received from a brother, or the beſt
friend I had, the ſame Prince, whom, by all manner of injuries I
had obliged to treat me with cruelty, forgetting all, out of an
admirable generoſity, and comforting me in my diſgrace with the
moſt obliging words could fall from man, gave me my liberty
without any condition, loaded me with preſents of great value,
and furniſhed me with ſhips and men to bring me to <hi>Rome,</hi> or
any other place where I would my ſelf. It might in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
be expected, I ſhould have been ſenſible of this treatment,
as much as I had been of my misfortune; but having, through
my diſgrace, beſides the fame I might have acquired in my former
years, loſt the government of two great Kingdoms, (a very high
fortune for a private man) and the hope of finding again among
the Romans an eſtabliſhment comparable to that I had loſt, the
grief I conceived thereat, had ſo cankered my ſoul, that I was not
able to entertain thoſe expreſſions of the goodneſſe and clemency
of the King of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> with the leaſt diſcovery of gratitude.
However I pretended to be extreamly ſenſible thereof, as I ought
to have been, of a favour I ſhould not have expected, and I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
with my liberty, the other effects of the magnificence of
that Prince, with thoſe demonſtrations which might well perſwade
him that I was not inſenſible thereof. I went a-board with a ſoul
half burſt with grief, and I carried with me into the ſea an afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
grown ſo violent, through the change of my fortune, that
there was nothing able to afford me any ſatisfaction. And yet I
am apt to imagine that my grief would have been ſatisfied in being
onely a torment to my self, without producing any effects preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
to the fortune of my Conquerour, if ſomething of chance,
and the ſollicitations of other perſons had not furniſhed me witl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the occaſions to do it, and that at a time wherein my ſufferings
were not aggravated by any deſign of revenge.</p>
                        <p>The third day after my departure I was overtaken by a Veſſel,
that came after me from <hi>Mauritania,</hi> and he that was Commander
of it being come aboard mine, to give me a viſit, was known to
me, to be a perſon of very great quality among the <hi>Moors,</hi> named
<hi>Theocles,</hi> whoſe Father had had under King <hi>Juba,</hi> the father of
<hi>Coriolanus,</hi> the greateſt places in the Kingdom, and the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of greateſt importance. But it happening upon the death
of King <hi>Juba,</hi> that <hi>Theocles</hi> revolted to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and ſided very
particularly with me, as having not the leaſt remainder of love
for the royal bloud, and that further he had expected till the iſſue
of the war, without declaring himſelf for his Prince, as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part of the <hi>Moors</hi> had done, young <hi>Juba,</hi> coming to the Throne,
had accordingly ſlighted him, though he had not any way diſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
him, nor taken away any thing he was poſſeſſed of, and in
the diſtribution of the Governments and charges which he beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on thoſe whom he thought moſt worthy, and had expreſſed
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:97242:166"/>
moſt affection towards him, he conceived himſelf not at all engaged
to prefer <hi>Theocles,</hi> whoſe pretenſions were great, ſuitably
to his quality, and the high rank his Father had lived in before
him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Theocles,</hi> thinking himſelf hardly dealt with, and taking it very
impatiently that his ſoveraigne ſhould prefer other perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, ſuch indeed as were inferiour to him in birth, but much
more conſiderable than he, by their ſervices and their fidelity to
their Prince, would needs leave <hi>Mauritania,</hi> and lurk among the
enemies of his King, and bring over with him among the Romanes
his reſentments and deſires of revenge. So that having taken ſhip
the ſame day that I departed, the third after, he comes up to me,
and coming out of his own veſſell into mine, he gave me a viſit,
making the greateſt expreſſions he could of the affection he had
for me. Now this man being he that of all the <hi>Moores</hi> I had held
the greateſt correſpondence with, and his diſcontents being not
unknowne to me, I was extreamly glad to meet with him, and
having underſtood from him, that the reſentments he had againſt
his Prince were the occaſion why he left the Country to follow
me, and to go along with me to <hi>Rome,</hi> this conſonancy of thoughts
made me the more confident of him, and raiſed in me a certain
affection for him, and engaged me to promiſe him all the friend-and

him to.</p>
                        <p>Thus reſolved we continued our voyage together, and in the
ſame veſſell; though we made his to follow us, and that very day
<hi>Theocles</hi> acquainted me at large with all I knew not that related
to his affaires, and diſburthened himſelf of all that lay upon
his heart; but with ſo much aggravation and animoſity againſt
his Prince, that, though I were really his enemy, and well pleaſed
to meet with a man that loved him not, yet could I not in my
Soule approve the procedure of his Subject, and that one that
had no ground given him of diſcontent. However, I diſſembled
the apprehenſion I had of it, as thinking it not amiſſe to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
him in that exaſperation, againſt a man I loved not: and ſo
mutually communicating our reſentments one to another we kept
on our voyage, and, having very good weather, came at laſt to
<hi>Brunduſium,</hi> where we landed. Here it was that I thought fit to
make ſome abode, to make ſome diſcovery what poſture my
affaires were in at <hi>Rome;</hi> and knowing well enough that the
loſſe of <hi>Mauritania</hi> happened partly through my fault, as having
not onely by tyranny and miſ-government, but alſo by the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
I had given the Souldiers to do them thouſands of injuries,
given the <hi>Moores</hi> occaſion to riſe in the behalf of their Prince,
and partly by reaſon of my neglect of preventing that revolt in
the firſt eruptions thereof, and, by that negligence, given <hi>Corio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus</hi>
leaſure to fortifie, and put himſelf into a condition to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſcend
the Throne, which he would have found very much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:97242:167"/>
to do, had I uſed all the diligence I ought to ſmother that
evill at its firſt breaking forth; the conſcience I had of this truth
troubled me extremly. By which put into a feare of the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> whom a loſſe ſo conſiderable as that of two great
kingdomes might very much exaſperate againſt me, and not
doubting but that there were a many perſons about him both
very ready, and very likely to do me any ill office, I thought
it no prudence to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> till I had before been aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
what I was either to hope or feare upon my coming
thither.</p>
                        <p>To that end I ſent one of my men with Letters to thoſe
Friends whom I had at <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein I intreated them to ſend
me word truely and without flattery how I ſtood in the favour
of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and what entertainment I was to expect from him,
after the misfortune that had happened to me. The meſſenger
got to <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſome few daies after returned thence with
ſome of my Friends; who came to ſee me at <hi>Brunduſium,</hi> and
theſe did not onely heighten the diſtruſt <hi>I</hi> was in before, but
withall told me poſitively, that there was no coming for me to
<hi>Rome,</hi> where I was extreamly ill ſpoken of, till I had in ſome
meaſure vindicated my ſelf; that the Emperour was prepoſſeſſed
with an opinion very diſadvantageous to me; and that if I did
not employ certain powerfull perſons that had much intereſt in
him; there was not onely very ſmall hopes I ſhould ever recover
my former fortune, but they thought there was no great ſafety
for my perſon, and accordingly adviſed me, till the tempeſt were
laid by ſome perſons I ſhould employ to do it, to continue at <hi>Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſium,</hi>
where I had the advantage of the ſea if I ſhould be put to
any extremity.</p>
                        <p>This diſcourſe, made to me by perſons whom I could not any
way ſuſpect, and whoſe Friendſhip I had great experiences of,
put me to more than ordinary diſtractions, inſomuch that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
not to leave <hi>Brunduſium;</hi> or look at <hi>Rome,</hi> till the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
indignation were appeaſed. To effect that, I writ a large
<hi>Manifeſto,</hi> in order to my juſtification, wherein I laid down all
the reaſons that made any way for me, and endeavoured to elude
all accuſations that were put up againſt me, and having delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it to my Friends they returned to <hi>Rome</hi> to ſet on work all
thoſe perſons who we were in hopes might prevaile any thing
with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and thoſe ſuch as had moſt power and authority
with him. I durſt not expect any thing from either <hi>Octavia</hi> or
<hi>Marcellus,</hi> as being not ignorant that there had ever been a very
great friendſhip between that Prince and the King of <hi>Mauritania.</hi>
I had as little confidence of the mediation of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> whom I
had ever obſerved an enemy to thoſe Governours, who by their
miſcarriages had exaſperated the nations they were to governe
againſt them, and ſo thought it my onely courſe to addreſſe my ſelf
to <hi>Livia</hi> and <hi>Tiberius</hi> who had ever been en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           <pb n="329" facs="tcp:97242:167"/>
and whoſe intereſt with <hi>Caeſar</hi> was not inferiour to that of any other
whatſoever.</p>
                        <p>I thereupon imagined, that my Friends, by the meanes of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius,</hi>
might ſet the Empreſſe on work who could do any thing
with <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and it was altogether that way that I adviſed them
to uſe their utmoſt endeavours. They departed in order to the
deſigne, and I remained ſtill at <hi>Brunduſium</hi> very much diſquieted
endeavouring what I could to ſhake off my affliction by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of <hi>Theocles,</hi> who would needs ſtay there with me, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
a very great engagement in my concernments. Some

I had not deſerved theſe demonſtrations of his goodneſſe, I made
a preteſtation to him, that I would ſacrifice the life and fortunes,
which I ſhould be obliged to him for, to ſerve him, and that
no conſideration in the world ſhould make me quit his intereſts.
After I had ſeverall times repeated this diſcourſe to him; I
do not doubt, <hi>ſaid be to me,</hi> but that in a noble ſoule, the
ſenſe and acknowledgement you are to have of the ſervice I
am to do you, will produce the effect you promiſe me it ſhall;
beſides that there is ſome reaſon our intereſts ſhould be joyned
together, ſince we have one common enemy that hath ruined
our fortunes, and hath croſſed all the happineſſe and enjoyments
of my life by all the obſtacles he could lay in my way. I
conceive you are not now to learne, <hi>Voluſius,</hi> what misfortunes
have happened to me through the means of this <hi>African,</hi> who,
not content to have diſputed <hi>Cleopatra</hi> with me, upon the ſcore
of his own good Fortune rather then any other advantages,
hath baſely attempted my life, and almoſt reduced it to the

by joyning with you who are obliged to be his enemy; but,
with my revenge, I ſeek the poſſeſſion of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> without
whom life it ſelf is unſupportable to me. I hope with your

lies in you power to do, you may aſſure your ſelf that there
ſhall not be any thing which I ſhall not both undertake and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
to give you ſatisfaction.</p>
                        <p>This diſcourſe of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> inſtead of putting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

raiſed in me no ſmall joy, by reaſon of the conformity
which I found there was between his ſentiments and mine at

<pb n="331" facs="tcp:97242:168"/>
any ſervice that he ſhould put me upon, <q>My lord, <hi>ſaid I to
him,</hi> I ſhall think my happineſſe much greater than I could
ever hope it would have been, if to the advantage which I
expect from your protection, you adde that which I ought to
expect from any employment wherein I may ſerve you. For,
though the Prince of <hi>Mauritania</hi> were not mine enemy, yet
ſo much am I engaged to your generoſity, that there is not
any thing which I ſhall not undertake to facilitate, both your
revenge, and the poſſeſſion you ſo much deſire of the Princeſſe
<hi>Cleopatra.</hi> Be pleaſed therefore onely to let me know how
you will diſpoſe of me in order thereto, and think me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
the aſſiſtances you promiſe me in my misfortune, if I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
not to merit them, by the earneſtneſſe I ſhall expreſſe in

                           <q>Now, now is the time, <hi>replied Tiberius,</hi> and, as my affaires
ſtand at the preſent, there is nothing can contribute more to
my happineſſe, then to perſwade the Princeſſe <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> that
<hi>Coriolanus</hi> hath forgotten her, now that he is gotten into the
throne, that matters of policy have ſtifled his affections, and
that, to ſecure his acquiſts, he ſeeks other alliances than thoſe
of a ruined houſe, ſuch as is that of <hi>Anthony,</hi> but theſe things
muſt ſhe be perſwaded to by authentick proofs, and ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
as ſhall not leave her any thing to doubt of. As
for the means how it may be done, I come to adviſe with you
as a perſon whoſe teſtimony in this caſe ſhe cannot miſtruſt
provided ſhe hear nothing of our interview; and I find there
is yet much leſſe difficulty to effect it then I had at firſt imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
by the account you have given me of the diſcontents of
<hi>Theocles,</hi> his quality among the <hi>Moors,</hi> and the deſire he hath
to be revenged of <hi>Coriolanus.</hi> I can aſſure you, <hi>ſaid I, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
him,</hi> that <hi>Theocles</hi> ſhall do any thing that we ſhall put
him upon, and that he is ſo ſtrangely exaſperated againſt <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riolanus,</hi>
that there is not any conſideration ſhall ſtave him from
doing that Prince all the ill offices that lie in his power.</q>

                           <hi>Tiberius</hi> recollected himſelf a little upon this diſcourſe; but at
laſt rejoyning to it; <q>If what you ſay be true, <hi>replied he,</hi> I ſee
an infallible expedient to do that effectually which I had
projected. The deſigne, at firſt ſight, you will think requires
much confidence, eſpecially as to <hi>Theocles,</hi> whoſe aſſiſtance
and agency in it is abſolutely neceſſary; but when you look
farther into it, you will find there's nothing of danger, and yet
the action, as to us ſhall be ſo meritorious, that all our houſe and
relations ſhall periſh, before you be expoſed to any inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
for having <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>
                           <q>Know then, that <hi>Coriolanus</hi> hath been ſometime heretofore,
very dearly loved by the Princeſſe <hi>Julia,</hi> inſomuch that it
was the perſwaſion of many people that <hi>Coriolanus</hi> was not
inſenſible of that affection. <hi>Marcellus</hi> himſelf grew not a
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:97242:169"/>
little jealous of it, ſo for that it had almoſt made a breach in
that Friendſhip which hath ever been ſo prejudiciall to my
affaires. When we have once facilitated your acceſſe to
<hi>Caeſar,</hi> and brought you into the ſame reputation with him as
you were in before, you may repreſent to him, that <hi>Coriola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
hath not ſet you at Liberty, and treated you with ſuch
extraordinary endearements, but upon condition that you
ſhould do him all the favour you could with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> in relation
to the deſigne he had to demand the Princeſſe <hi>Julia,</hi> and
preſent <hi>Theocles</hi> (whoſe rank and quality might well ſuit with
an Embaſſie, to him as a perſon commiſſionated to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
To that effect, <hi>Thoocles</hi> in an equipage conformable to
that employment, wherein there ſhalbe nothing awanting as
to matter of expence, may addreſſe himſelf to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> with
credentiall Letters under the great ſeale of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> which
it will not be hard to find at <hi>Rome,</hi> among thoſe of diverſe
other Kingdomes, that have been brought thither after their
reduction into <hi>Romane</hi> Provinces, and propoſe unto him in
the name of his King; That if, with the Peace which he
ſhould be deſirous to have with him, he would alſo beſtow
on him the Princeſſe <hi>Julia</hi> in marriage, he would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to him, as all other tributary Kings did, and would take
his Kingdomes as dependent of the Empire. This propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
muſt be made withall the ſolemnities requiſite to ſo
great an Embaſſe: and in regard we are at a great diſtance from
<hi>Mauritania,</hi> ſo that there is not any commerce between us and
that Country, and that as things ſtand at the preſent there's
little hope we ſhall have any, it is impoſſible we ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.
And though it may be thought ſomewhat unlikely
there ſhould be ſo ſudden a change, and ſo beyond all expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in the affections of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> yet there happens daily
things no leſſe ſtrange, which, notwithſtanding their diſtance
from probability, are yet neighbours to truth, and there wilbe
thoſe whom it will not be hard to perſwade, that his <hi>
                                 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                                    <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                                 </gap>
                              </hi>
both made him forget his <hi>Love,</hi> and that in the condition he is
now arrived to, deſirous of a reſt he never yet met with, he
could no way better effect it than by making a peace, and court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the alliance of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> of whom he might expect the former
upon the conditions propoſed, though he took him not into
the latter. And we ſhall find it a matter of ſo much the leſſe
difficulty to make <hi>Cleopatra</hi> ſenſible of his inſidelity, for that I
have it from very good hands, that, ſince his departure, ſhe hath
not heard any thing from him, and that ſhe hath already concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
no ſmall jealouſie of what we would perſwade her to. By
this intrigue, I ſhall not onely turne that love which <hi>Cleopatra</hi>
hath for <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> into a higher degree of averſion for him,
which is the onely rub that lies in my way to happineſſe: but
I ſhall alſo diſſolve that Friendſhip which <hi>Marcellus</hi> hath for him,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:97242:169"/>
by making him believe that <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> addreſſing himſelf to
<hi>Julia,</hi> whom he loves, and looks on as deſigned for him, is no
leſſe perfidious to him then to <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> And by that means,
I ſhall deprive our enemy of a friend, whoſe intereſt with <hi>Caeſar</hi>
hath hitherto been the greateſt obſtacle I have had to ſtruggle
with; and inſtead of thoſe ſupplies which he ſecretly receives
from him, and the good offices he daily does him with <hi>Cleopatra,</hi>
he will have the greateſt indignation, and moſt irreconcileable
hatred that can be againſt him. So that, to arrive to the felicity
I aim at, and to make my revenge the more compleat, I ſhall not
be oppoſed either by the love of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> or the friendſhip of
<hi>Marcellus,</hi> which will be both deſtroyed by an artifice that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be diſcovered in many years.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>I hearkned with a great deal of patience to this diſcourſe of
<hi>Tiberius,</hi> and found in it many things not eaſily digeſtible,
as ſuch as muſt needs bring us into many inconveniences; but I
overcame the greateſt part of the difficulties I ſhould meet with,
by the great deſire I had to purchaſe his friendſhip and protection.
Whereupon, aſſuming the diſcourſe when he had given over
ſpeaking; <q>My Lord, <hi>ſaid I to him,</hi> though your deſign ſeems to
carry in it much danger, and requires no ſmall daringneſſe in
thoſe that are employed in it, yet all muſt be hazarded to ſerve
you, and we ſhall not be diſcouraged by any conſiderations
whatſoever from effecting your ſatisfaction. But I ſhall take the
boldneſſe to propoſe it to you, whether it were not fitter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
ſome other perſon rather then <hi>Julia,</hi> ſo not to draw on you
the diſpleaſure and intereſt of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> whom we muſt viſibly
engage againſt us, by demanding of <hi>Caeſar</hi> a perſon whom he is
in love with, and that is deſigned for him. By this demand,
<hi>replies Tiberius,</hi> we break the friendſhip that is between <hi>Marcellus</hi>
and <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> which it concerns me moſt of any thing to do;
But we do not thereby any way injure <hi>Murcellus,</hi> and you do
not run the hazard of encurring his diſpleaſure, (though you
may well be aſſured that your party ſhall not be weaker then his,
after the union of our intereſts, and conſidering what you
may expect from our houſe) for, as it is not hard for you to
imagine, there is little likelihood that this perſonated Embaſſy
of <hi>Theocles</hi> from <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> ſhould any way prejudice <hi>Marcellus,</hi>
or that <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould prefer the allyance of that <hi>African,</hi> his
enemy, before that of his Nephew, whom he loves no leſſe then
if he were his own ſon, and deſignes to be his ſucceſſor. No
doubt, all he will do, will be to laugh at the extravagance of
<hi>Juba's</hi> demand, but though the effect it will have upon him, will
ſignifie nothing, in <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and <hi>Marcellus,</hi> it will do all that
I expect it ſhould: ſo that I am in ſome hopes to enjoy <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra</hi>
long before the truth be diſcovered. And if ever it
ſhould come to light, I promiſe you, that through the power of
the Empreſſe, who will be abſolutely for us, we ſhall reconcile
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:97242:170"/>
all, it being to be preſumed that the Emperour will not be much
diſpleaſed at an artifice, which hath no deſign in it, but that of
aſſuring me of the enjoyment of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and is not prejudicial
to any but his greateſt enemy.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>To theſe, <hi>Tiberius</hi> added a many other reaſons to encourage
me to engage in his deſign, ſo that there needed not much to
enflame the diſpoſition I was already in to ſerve him, into a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to do any thing he would have me, and by his own natural
eloquence, and the inclination I had of my ſelf to be perſwaded, he
took off all the difficulties I could make to my ſelf when he firſt
made his propoſition to me.</p>
                        <p>After I had reiterated the proteſtation I had made to him, we
called <hi>Theocles,</hi> to whom <hi>Tiberius</hi> repeated all thoſe things he had
ſaid to me, and without any difficulty brought him to a reſolution
to undertake any thing, which he the ſooner was perſwaded to,
as well by reaſon he was naturally miſchievous, and revengefull,
but withal very indiſcreet and inconſiderate, as by the hopes he
was put into by <hi>Tiberius,</hi> of great fortunes and aſſiſtances among
the <hi>Romans.</hi> At laſt he reſolved to endeavour any thing ſhould
be propoſed to him, and made no difficulty to perſonate the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour
of his King, and to take all his inſtructions from <hi>Tiberius.</hi>
We ſtayed together all that day, and the beſt part of the night,
to take all the order requiſite in our deſign, and when we had
ſetled all things, and thought our ſelves fully inſtructed, <hi>Tiberius</hi>
departed from that houſe to go and endeavour my peace with
<hi>Auguſtus,</hi> having deſired us not to ſtir thence till we had heard
from him; but with as much ſecrecy as might be, leaſt there
ſhould be any ſuſpicion of our interview. We accordingly ſtaid
there as he had ordered us, while in the mean time <hi>Tiberius,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made a full diſcovery of his deſign to the Empreſſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
to her, that all the happineſſe of his life conſiſted in the
hope he was in to enjoy the Princeſſe <hi>Cleopatra. Livia,</hi> who
who had a very great tenderneſſe for him, after ſome few difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
were ſatisfied, engaged in our deſign upon you, and promiſed
him all the aſſiſtances ſhe could afford him to effect it. He thought
it not fit to make the leaſt diſcovery of it to his brother <hi>Druſus,</hi>
as knowing him to be a Prince of a candid and open diſpoſition,
and conſequently would not have approved thoſe artifices, ſo that
all the perſons acquainted with, and concerned in our plot, were
onely <hi>Livia, Tiberius, Theocles,</hi> and my ſelf. For as to the perſons
we were to make uſe of, we eaſily perſwaded them to what we
would have had all others to believe. <hi>Livia</hi> ſollicited my read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
into the Emperours favour with ſo much ſucceſſe, that ſhe
ſoon diſpelled thoſe clouds of reproaches and accuſations which
my adverſaries had raiſed againſt me; and yet ſo ordered all things,
that <hi>Tiberius</hi> was not any way ſuſpected to have any hand in it,
pretending, that what ſhe did, was upon the importunity of ſome
of my friends, who were perſons of very conſiderable quality in
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:97242:170"/>
                           <hi>Rome.</hi> So that aſſoon as <hi>Tiberius</hi> underſtood that I might have
acceſſe to the Emperour, he ſent to me by a truſty perſon, even the
very ſame that had accompanied him in the interview, that I ſhould
come to <hi>Rome,</hi> and without any fear prepare my ſelf to put in
execution what we had undertaken. We departed thence, <hi>Theocles</hi>
and myſelf, and got thither much about the ſame time as our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
and equipage, which we had ſent for to <hi>Brunduſium;</hi> but
before I preſented my ſelf to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> we had another ſecret confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and having underſtood from him how ſtrong
our party was, by reaſon of the Empreſſes being of it, he further
acquainted us, how that he had in his hands the great ſeal of the
Kings of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> and the order he had taken for the liveries
of the Ambaſſadours, and for all other things that were requiſite
to our deſign. The next day, I waited on the Emperour, who,
ſuitably to the hopes that <hi>Tiberius</hi> had put me into, entertained
me with abundance of courteſie, imputing my unhappineſſe to
fortune onely, and ſeeming to be ſatisfied with the reaſons which
had been given him in order to my juſtification. And though he
diſcovered nothing ſo much in his diſcourſe, as the violent aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
he had for <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> yet did I ſtill give him the greateſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
imaginable, celebrating his valour, and acknowledging
the extraordinary civilities I had received from him, in ſuch terms
as eaſily diſcovered that I was far from being his enemy. For thus
had <hi>Tiberius</hi> and my ſelf ordered the buſineſſe to be carried, it
being reſolved that <hi>Theocles</hi> and I ſhould ſpeak well of him every
where, ſo to take off all ſuſpicion men might conceive of any evil
deſign that we might have againſt him. The firſt time I was
brought to the Emperour, I gave him onely an account of my own
affairs, as alſo of thoſe of <hi>Mauritania;</hi> but in the ſecond au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
I had, which was when all things were ready and
ripe for <hi>Tiberius</hi>'s deſign, I had ſome diſcourſe with him
about <hi>Theocles</hi>'s commiſſion, and demanded audience for
him.</p>
                        <p>But here Madam, and you my Lord, continued <hi>Voluſius</hi> looking
on <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and <hi>Marcellus,</hi> I am now come to that part of my rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which, being to give you an account of things you are
but too well acquainted with already, will accordingly be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
to you. For you know as well as my ſelf how we were
entertained by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as alſo with what contempt he looked on
the <hi>Embaſſy</hi> of <hi>Theocles,</hi> and in a word, all the particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of our negotiation. You alſo beſt know what influence our
deſign had upon your ſelves, in ſome meaſure anſwering the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
of <hi>Tiberius;</hi> yet ſo, Madam, as that, to his misfortune
and my unhappineſſe, he made not that advantage thereof he was
in hope it might have produced, ſince that though you ceaſed to
love a Prince whom you conceived inconſtant to you, yet did it
not occaſion the leaſt change in you as to what thoughts you had
of <hi>Tiberius;</hi> nay, on the contrary, the averſion you had had for
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:97242:171"/>
him, ſeemed to be far greater then it was before, upon this accident.</p>
                        <p>At this paſſage <hi>Voluſius</hi> made a little ſtop, as if he had gone
through the firſt part of his relation; and <hi>Marcellus</hi> perceiving, that
the Princeſs, having ſummoned all the forces of her reſolution and
conſtancy, to keep up her ſpirits at this reiteration of her cruel
afflictions, was, nevertheleſſe, forced to give paſſage to certain
tears, doing himſelf a little violence to avoid expreſſing the ſame
weakneſſe; <q>It is but too true, <hi>ſaid he to voluſius,</hi> that your bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
combination produced effects but too deplorable, and that
if the crafty <hi>Tiberius</hi> made no advantage of it, through the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of the gods, who have ever a puniſhment for ſuch trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
deſignes; he drew nevertheleſſe this ſatisfaction from
it, that he filled our ſouls with a mortal grief, and that it did
me more miſchief then you expected it ſhould, in regard of that
ſtrange influence it had on the diſpoſition of the unconſtant
<hi>Julia,</hi> which it might have had on that of the generous <hi>Cleopatra.</hi>
Tis ſhe, <hi>Voluſius,</hi> whom you have not yet juſtified, though you
have aſſured us of the fidelity of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> and though <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
and your ſelf have over-reached us to the prejudice of that
poor Prince, who, you tell us, had not really ſo much as thought
of <hi>Julia;</hi> yet hath that unmindfull Princeſſe appeared ſuch
upon that occaſion as ſhe had done upon diverſe others before,
and the feigned expreſſions of the love and pretended deſign
of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> drew from her very earneſt ones of the refluxe of
that affection which ſhe had ſometimes had for him. Ah, my
Lord, <hi>ſaies Voluſius, reaſſuming the diſcourſe,</hi> entertain not any
ſuch thought, and aſſure your ſelf, if you dare credit a man
acknowledging himſelf guilty of ſo great a cheat, that <hi>Julia</hi>
hath ſhewn her ſelf upon this emergency, no leſſe conſtant then
<hi>Coriolanus,</hi> and that ſhe entertained with abundance of contempt
what we would have perſwaded her to, as to the affection of
<hi>Coriolanus.</hi> The gods are my witneſſes that I have not in the
leaſt contributed to the occaſions of your jealouſie, but was told
by <hi>Toeocles,</hi> after he had received orders from the Emperour to
leave <hi>Rome</hi> within ſome few daies, that <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who had made
him his abſolute creature, and had promiſed him a ſecure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,
though he ſaw him but very privately, and that in publick
he pretended not the leaſt acquaintance with him, would needs,
out of an extraordinary ſuggeſtion of malice, have him give you
ſome occaſion of jealouſie, the more to enflame the reſentment
you might have againſt the King of <hi>Mauritania.</hi> This was to be
done by the means of one of <hi>Julia's</hi> women, who, being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by preſents, was to give him admittance two nights
ſucceſſively, into the lodgings of that Princeſſe, ſo to put you
into an imagination that he had ſecret conferences with her.
But he hath proteſted to me, with many imprecations, that he
never ſaw the Princeſſe, and that he had not ſpoken to any but
that onely woman, whoſe name is <hi>Acilia,</hi> if I miſtake it not, with
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:97242:171"/>
whom he had paſſed over ſeveral hours in the Princeſſes Wardrobe,
and whence he never came but at ſuch hours, as there muſt needs
be notice taken of him.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cleopatra</hi> having wiped her eies, looking on <hi>Marcellus</hi> with a
very ſerious countenance; <q>I know not, brother, <hi>ſaid he to him,</hi>
whether you dare truſt me as far as you would <hi>Voluſius.</hi> But
if the late diſſatisfactions which you have expreſſed your ſelf
to be in as to <hi>Julia,</hi> proceed meerly from thoſe ſecret interviews
which ſhe hath been ſuſpected to have had with <hi>Theocles,</hi> they
are very unjuſt, and beſides that the Princeſſe coming to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
it after your departure, hath ſufficiently cleared her ſelf in
my preſence, as alſo by the acknowledgments of <hi>Marcella</hi> and
<hi>Antonia</hi> your Siſters, who ſpent thoſe two nights with her, I can,
for my own part, aſſure you, that during the repreſentation of
all this pretended infidelity of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> ſhe expreſſed nothing
but a very great diſpleaſure and indignation againſt him. I ſhould
have acquainted you with as much, had you not been gone from
<hi>Rome</hi> without taking any leave from us, and muſt further let
you know, that, according to my apprehenſions of it, you cannot
any longer juſtly charge with lightneſſe a Princeſſe, who, in your
abſence, though ſhe had reaſon to take it very much amiſſe,
hath ever expreſſed a firme and faithfull affection towards
you.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>At theſe words of <hi>Cleopatra, Marcellus,</hi> who repoſed no ſmall
confidence in any thing came from her, ſeemed to put on another
countenance, and looking on her with an action, wherein ſhe might
diſcover the change they had wrought in his heart: <q>Ah Siſter,
<hi>ſaid he to her,</hi> how much does the aſſurance of a perſon ſuch as
you are, fortifie that of <hi>Voluſius,</hi> and what ſufferings and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
had I avoided, if I had been acquainted with what I now
hear from your mouth, and which I cannot but give credit to, by
reaſon of the authority which you have over my belief, with as
much confidence, as if I had it from the relation of <hi>Voluſius.</hi>
For my relation, <hi>replyed Voluſius,</hi> you have no more reaſon to
ſuſpect it as to this particular, then you do as to the other truths
which you have received from me: and if you will but afford
me your patient audience to the end, you ſhall find, that, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the intereſt which makes me ſpeak, it is impoſſible I ſhould
entertain you with any thing but what is true.</q> The Princeſſe
and the Prince having, upon thoſe words, expreſſed their readineſs
to give him the attention he deſired, he thereupon reaſſumed his
diſcourſe, whereof <hi>Marcellus</hi> hearkened to the ſequele with
much more ſerenity of thoughts then he had done to the former
part.</p>
                        <p>When <hi>Tiberius</hi> firſt engaged me, with <hi>Theocles,</hi> to be inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
in the cheat he had reſolved to put upon you, my readineſſe to

                           </gap>ntments
I had conceived againſt the King of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> as the
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:97242:172"/>
neceſſity I then ſtood in of his aſſiſtance, to be readmitted into favour
with <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and the expectation he put me into, of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of <hi>Livia,</hi> his own, and that of all his friends, for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of my Fortunes which I had loſt, with the government of
<hi>Mauritania.</hi> He put me into ſome hopes, that, by the recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of <hi>Livia,</hi> I might be entruſted with other employments,
not inferiour, or leſſe conſiderable, then that, nay haply with the
ſame again, if the Emperour brought that Kingdom under ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
                        <p>He performed theſe promiſes he had made to me in ſome part,
and, as I have told you, he made my peace with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> before he
got me to do any thing in the deſign, wherein I was to ſerve him.
But, when he perceived that the artifices he had made uſe of, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
not his expectation, and that though they had proved ſo
fortunate as to ſatisfie you both of the infidelity of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi>
and conſequently deſtroy or divert the affection you have had for
that Prince, yet would not that diverſion prove any way advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
to himſelf, nor raiſe in the Princeſſes heart thoſe inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which were loſt as to <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> he immediately grew cold,
not minding my concernments at all, or the great hopes he had,
not long before, put me into. I was ſenſible of that change of
his diſpoſition by many circumſtances, and took notice of it with
no ſmall diſſatisfaction. However, at the firſt I took all things with
abundance of patience, as not thinking it very ſtrange, that the
diſtraction <hi>Tiberius</hi> was in, which was ſuch as made him leſſe care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of himſelf, might well make him reflect but little on his friends,
and that, conſidering with himſelf what little poſſibility he was
in to gain your affections, Madam, at a time where he was in a
manner confident not to meet with any difficulty, as having no
Rival to ballance his ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>reſſes to you, his humour ſeemed to be
ſomewhat changed from what it was, and diſcovered ſome remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that earneſtneſſe which he had before expreſſed to do me
all the favours I could expect from him. But when I ſaw
that his coldneſſe encreaſed more and more, and that the
Empreſſe did me not any good office with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> I began
to be troubled, and to give entertainment to that remorſe
which ever attends guilt, when a man reaps not the benefit which
had encouraged him to the commiſſion of a crime.</p>
                        <p>However <hi>Tiberius</hi> thought fit, out of policy, to flatter me ſtill
with ſome ſlight remainders of hope, and held it no prudence to
make an abſolute breach with me, out of a fear that the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
I might conceave thereat, ſhould engage me to diſcover the
truth of what had paſt. Upon theſe conſiderations was it, that he,
being prodigal enough of his kindneſſe and careſſes, when there
is any thing of concernment to himſelf, entertained me with civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
ſuch as, in appearance, were the moſt obliging in the World.
But I perceived that in effect, he thought but little of me, and
minded me no more then as a complice, in the baſe trick he had
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:97242:172"/>
put upon you, and one that he could gladly have wiſhed out of
the World, ſo to be rid of a fear of being ſometime or other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed.
His carriage was not the ſame towards <hi>Theocles,</hi> and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to be a perſon of miſchievous inclinations, and one fit to
be put upon any enterpriſe, he had held him in a very fair correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence
to be made uſe of in a deſign he had, and to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
as I have told you, to perſwade Prince <hi>Marcellus</hi> that the
Princeſſe <hi>Julia</hi> treated privately with him upon the negotiation,
he was ſent thither upon, from <hi>Coriolanus.</hi> When the Emperour
had ſent him an order to leave <hi>Rome,</hi> he ſent him to a houſe of his
own, within a daies journy from the City, and there kept him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly,
till the time of his departure, which was within few daies
after. You know how he left <hi>Rome,</hi> in a manner alone, without
any attendance, and went his waies, ſo obſcurely, that it was not
known what deſign he was gone upon, nor what way he had taken
at his departure. He gave out, ſome daies before, (as I alſo heard
my ſelf) that his intention was to find out <hi>Coriolanus</hi> in the midſt
of his dominions, and to be revenged by his death, for the wound
he had received from him, ſince the Emperour had denied him all
other waies of ſatisfaction, and thought not fit to truſt him with
the command of that naval army which he had ſent againſt him,
under the conduct of <hi>Domitius Aenobarbus,</hi> and I was confirmed
in the confidence I had that he was gone away upon that reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when I underſtood that he had taken <hi>Theocles</hi> along with
him, who was well acquainted with the Country, and might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
very much facilitate the execution of his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe.</p>
                        <p>The departure of <hi>Tiberius</hi> put me into no ſmall aſtoniſhment,
as being a thing that came not within my expectation, for I found
my ſelf, by that means, much to my diſcomfort, deprived of that
little aſſiſtance which I was as yet in hopes to receive from him.
That which put me into a greater neceſſity of it, was, that, by the
concernment I had in <hi>Theocles</hi>'s negotiation, I had drawn upon me
your diſpleaſure, my Lord, with that of all your houſe, and that
of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s, which are the moſt powerful of the Empire, and
againſt which I could not hold out long, but by the intereſt of
<hi>Livia.</hi> Not my Lord, that I ever received any diſcourteſie either
from your ſelf or the Princeſſe, or that you did me any ill office
that ever I could hear of; but it was not hard for me to take
notice that you were all but little pleaſed with me, and I was
not ignorant that you were in a capacity to do me a diſpleaſure
whenever you had a mind to do it. For your part, my Lord, you
ſoon put me out of that fear, by your departure ſome few daies
after <hi>Tiberius,</hi> which was almoſt after the ſame manner, and, as
moſt people were of opinion, with the ſame deſign; but the
Princeſſe <hi>Octavia</hi> ſtaid behind, as alſo the Princeſſes your Siſters,
and diverſe other perſons of great credit with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who were
all very much diſſatisfied with me. <hi>Livia</hi> and <hi>Druſus</hi> were indeed
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:97242:173"/>
able to counterballance that credit of theirs; but <hi>Livia</hi> counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced
me no longer, when <hi>Tiberius</hi> once forbore his ſollicitations
on my behalf, and <hi>Druſus,</hi> a perſon of a more then orninary vertue,
finding haply little inclination to any ſuch thing in me, and having
at my firſt coming conceived a prejudice againſt me, expreſſed not
the leaſt friendſhip towards me.</p>
                        <p>Thus was I, in a manner, diſcarded by all, little eſteemed by
<hi>Caeſar,</hi> who had not entertained me but upon the mediation of
<hi>Livia,</hi> and abuſed by thoſe that ſaw me fallen, through my own
negligence, from that noble employment, and favour of fortune
wherein I ſeemed to have been ſo well ſettled. My ancient friends,
nay my own relations began to ſlight me, and not to endure my
company without ſome violence; ſo that inſtead of continuing in
the hopes I had conceived to be reſtored to my former condition,
I found my ſelf in a probability to waſt away my life, not onely in
the condition of a private man, but withal, in that of one of the
moſt unfortunate of mankind. The reflection I made on this alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
filling me with melancholy and deſpair, began to reinflam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thoſe regrets in my ſoul, which I might well conceive for the abuſe
I had done to ſo great a Prince, and made me look on my preſent
fortune as a viſible effect of Heavens juſtice, whom I had incenſed
againſt me, by an unreaſonable deſire of revenge, and the carrying
on of a baſe and unworthy project. I made all the friends I could
for ſeveral employments, which were all denied me, though they
were ſuch as I might well pretend to; and I found at laſt that
there was no living for me in <hi>Rome,</hi> but with the conte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>pt even
of thoſe perſons who had ſometime adored my greatneſſe. This
conſideration ſtuck ſuch arrows in my heart, that, at laſt, being no
longer able to hold out againſt my affliction, I fell into a long and
dangerous ſickneſſe, which I was ſtruggling with when <hi>Caeſar</hi> left
<hi>Rome</hi> to go that vaſt progreſſe he intended through the Empire,
and from which he is not yet returned.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall not trouble you with the particulars of my ſickneſſe
which kept me faſtened to my bed in a manner ever ſince that time,
and during which there have happened very ſtrange and great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions,
eſpecially in <hi>Mauritania,</hi> which, upon the abſence of
its valiant Prince, whoſe preſence might have maintained it againſt
all the World, is fallen under the power of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> Hearing
this news at <hi>Rome,</hi> grief ſeized me afreſh, as reflecting on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
I had been fed with by <hi>Tiberius,</hi> to be reſtored to that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
if ever it were reduced. At laſt, after a long and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
ſickneſſe, I made a ſhift to leave my bed, much about two
months ſince; and conceiving, that change of air, might contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
ſomewhat to the recovery of my health, I departed from
<hi>Rome,</hi> and went to ſpend ſome time in certain houſes I had ſtill
left me in <hi>Italy.</hi> When I was grown to ſome competency of
ſtrength, I would needs take a further progreſſe, and after I had
ſpent ſome time in viſits among my friends, (if I may ſay that in my
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:97242:173"/>
misfortune I had preſerved any) I went to a certain houſe belonging
to <hi>Mummius,</hi> diſtant from <hi>Brunduſium</hi> about an hours riding.
There had I ſtaid two daies, when, by ſome that belonged to <hi>Mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius,</hi>
who went almoſt every day to <hi>Brunduſium,</hi> I underſtood
that <hi>Tiberius</hi> was newly arrived there. I was a little ſurprized
at that news, nay, ſo far, that I was in ſuſpence what courſe I
ſhould take, as not knowing whether it were then a fit time for
me to waite on him, to put him in mind of the promiſes he
had made to me, and to acquaint him with the ſad condition
I was reduced to, or ſit down in the perſwaſion I was of that he
had abſolutely forgotten me. But at laſt, ſome little ſcantlings of
hope, that he would in ſome meaſure perform what he had
promiſed, encouraged me into a reſolution to ſee him. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
I went to <hi>Brunduſium,</hi> and preſented my ſelf to him, at
a time, that in all probability he was not much taken up with
any thoughts of me. Tis generally known what a great maſter
he is in the art of diſſimulation, yet could he not ſo diſguiſe
himſelf at my firſt appearance, but that I could eaſily perceive
he was ſomewhat at a loſſe to ſee me there, and that I was not
the welcomeſt perſon in the World to him. But after a while
recovering himſelf and his artifices, he entertained me with
abundance of ſeeming obligation, even to the making of a
many excuſes to me that he had left <hi>Rome</hi> without giving
me notice of it, and ſwearing that that injury, (if it were
any) was no more then he had done to all the World beſides,
thoſe onely excepted whom he had taken along with him, and
that he had concealed his deſign from all, that ſo it might not be in
the power of any to prevent it.</p>
                        <p>Finding him in ſuch a poſture of civility towards me, I thought
it a fit time, in plain terms, to acquaint him with the miſerable
condition I was then in as to point of fortunes, and did ſilently
reproach him with a certain baſeneſſe, in that he had forſaken
me, after I had upon his account engaged my ſelf in an action,
which had raiſed me enemies among the moſt powerful perſons
about the Emperour. I alſo took occaſion to put him in mind of
the promiſe he had made me for my recovery of the government
I had loſt, if it came within the power of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Tiberius</hi> diſſembled the vexation which this diſcourſe muſt
needs put him into, and affirming that he ſtill perſiſted in the ſame
reſolutions, he told me that the reaſon of his ſtay at <hi>Brunduſium,</hi> was,
to learn by thoſe that he had ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> in what place he might
meet with the Emperour, who, as he had underſtood, was ſo far
gone in his progreſſe as into <hi>Aſia,</hi> out of a deſign he had to viſit
the Provinces of the Empire. That as ſoon as his people were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
his reſolutions were to put to ſea again to overtake
<hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s Court, where he promiſed me to endeavour all
that lay in his power with him and the Empreſſe to reſettle me
in <hi>Mauritania,</hi> in the ſame condition I had been in before.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="342" facs="tcp:97242:174"/>
Seeing him in this humour, though I durſt not be over-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of his promiſes, I entreated him that he would be pleaſed
to take me along with him in that voyage, and give me leave once
more to try, whether I could recover my ſelf out of the wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of my fortunes by his protection and aſſiſtance. <hi>Tiberius</hi>
entertained that requeſt with a countenance wherein it was viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that he thought me a trouble to him. Yet durſt he not deny
it me, out of a fear, as I have had good ground to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine
ſince, leaſt ſuch a diſappointment might oblige me to
diſcover the combination and the deſigne we had to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
you; which it ſeems he was very loath ſhould take any
aire, though he had not made that advantage thereof which
he expected. He therefore was content I ſhould accompany
him, inſomuch that having ſome three daies after received from
<hi>Rome</hi> the account he expected, and the accommodations he
had ſent for, in order to his retinue, I went aboard, by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
taking along with me but a ſmall number of ſervants
that had attended me to <hi>Mummius</hi>'s houſe; and ſo we directed
our courſe towards <hi>Alexandria,</hi> whither he had underſtood that
the Emperour was to come within a ſhort time, and to make ſome
ſtay there.</p>
                        <p>I had forgot to tell you, that I found <hi>Theocles</hi> with him, in
very good terms, as to matter of truſt and intimacy, which I was
at firſt very glad to ſee: but not many daies after I perceived that
the good inclinations which that Barbarian had ſometimes
expreſſed to me, were in a manner loſt, and that I was much more
an eye-ſore to him then to <hi>Tiberius.</hi> I underſtood from both,
that they had been in <hi>Mauritania,</hi> to endeavour, by any
means they could, the death of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> it being, it ſeems,
the judgement of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> that he might compaſſe it any
way whatſoever, without any prejudice to his honour, after
the treatment he had received from that Prince in <hi>Rome,</hi> and
the courſe he had taken to be ſatisfied of him by other waies, if
the Emperour had thought it good to beſtow on him the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the naval army which he had deſired. They further
told me, what trouble it was to him that he had not met with
him in his own Kingdom, and that after they had ſought him up
and down in others the next to it, he thought it beſt to take
his way back again to <hi>Rome,</hi> out of an imagination he
might be ſecretly returned thither to ſee the Princeſſe <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opatra.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Though I was no friend to <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> as I think I had ſufficiently
made it appear, yet this perſidiouſneſſe of <hi>Theocles</hi> could I not
but conceive a horrour at, perceiving it to be ſuch as egg'd him
on to compaſſe the death of his Prince; and this troubled me ſo
much, that I could not forbear diſcovering it to him, ſo far as
that I could not any way approve of it. It was no doubt an
imprudent action in me, and the Barbarian conceiving himſelf
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:97242:174"/>
diſobliged, not onely forbore all further correſpondence with
me, but raiſing ſuſpicions in <hi>Tiberius</hi> of me, he had ever and
anon private conferences with him, which I muſt not be admitted
to, and accordingly gave me occaſion to miſt ruſt there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
a-brewing againſt me.</p>
                        <p>Thus we kept on our voyage which proved proſperous enough,
till that yeſterday we landed upon this river, at a little City
which is diſtant about three houres riding from this place, <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
it ſeems, being unwilling to come up into the port of
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> out of a deſigne, as he told me, to come into the
City undiſcovered. In order to that reſolution he told us that
we muſt be divided into ſeverall parties the better to avoid going
in ſuch a number and equipage as might occaſion any diſcovery,
and thereupon ordered me to go before with <hi>Theocles,</hi> ſeven
or eight of his men and onely two of mine, aſſigning <hi>Theocles</hi> a
place in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where it was appointed we ſhould all meet
at night. We got on horſeback (I all this time not having the
leaſt miſtruſt of the wicked deſigne they had upon me) and rode
a good way diſcourſing of indifferent things, the diſtance which
was between <hi>Theocles</hi> and my ſelf being not come to that
height as to hinder us from diſcourſing together. At laſt
being come into a wood, which from the river ſide reaches
ſome ſtadia into the neighbour-hood. <hi>Theocles</hi> began to rip
up the former diſcourſe we had together ſome daies before,
concerning the ſervice he would have done <hi>Tiberius</hi> in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
he had undertaken to be the death of his own Prince;
and told me that he very much wondred, I ſhould diſapprove
his proceeding, being guilty of an action that was no better,
and had my ſelf engaged him in a cheat; which he had never
been drawn into but by my advice and encouragement. Though
I might well imagine that <hi>Theocles</hi> fell not upon that diſcourſe
but with a deſigne to quarrell with me, and find a pretence
without infamy to <hi>Tiberius</hi> to put in execution what they had
baſely plotted againſt me, yet did I not reflect on it ſoon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and accordingly could not forbear telling him, that
there was a vaſt difference between an action wherein we had
been jointly engaged (though truely conſidered, it were very
horrid) and the deſigne to murther a King in his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
and that there was the greater difference between
thoſe two actions, in regard of us by as much as that I was
a <hi>Romane</hi> and he a <hi>Subject</hi> to <hi>Coriolanus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This barbarous wretch, who, what anſwer ſoever I had made,
would have found the pretence he was ſo deſirous of, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be tranſported with indignation at this diſcourſe,
drew his ſword and ran at me with all the fury he could. I
ſhould have been but little frightned at his action, if all thoſe
that were about him had not done the like, and with the ſame
labour ſatisfied me, that <hi>Tiberius</hi> had not beſtowed that guard
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:97242:175"/>
on me but to give me my death. Of my two men, the more
affectionate loſt his life at my feet, and the other frightned
ſaved himſelf by getting into the wood, ſo that I was forced
to ſtand alone to the fury of thoſe cruell Butchers, who came
about me and gave me two great wounds. No queſtion, but a
thouſand more had followed to diſpatch me out of this world,
and I ſaw it was to no purpoſe to think to lengthen my life by a
fruitleſſe reſiſtance, when it pleaſed Fortune to direct into that
part of the wood a man armed all over, mounted on a very
ſtately horſe, and attended onely by an Eſquire. He made a little
halt to ſee what was done, and perceiving he had but little
time to looſe, if he would ſave my life, after he had anticipated
his coming by a great outcry, and in few words reproached my
enemies with baſeneſſe and cowardice, he ran in among them with
a fury to which nothing can be compared, and having with the
ſhock of his horſe overthrown the firſt he met within his way,
he ſet upon the reſt with ſuch eagerneſſe as ſhewed he was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
daunted at their number. And whereas they, as well as I,
had no other armes then their ſwords, he ſpent very few blowes
which either carried not death along with them, or made thoſe
they met with uncapable of fighting any longer. <hi>Theocles</hi> aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
at this miraculous relief, and perceiving there was no
poſſibility to make an end of me till he had rid his hands of
the ſtranger, endeavoured with the aſſiſtance of his men to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
him. But as it happened, he ran upon his own death, for
that valiant man having received upon his buckler the blowes
he made at him, ran him clear through the body, and ſo he
fell down to the ground, and immediately breathed his laſt.
His companions were but weak in their endeavours to revenge
his fall, and finding themſelves reduced to one halfe of the
number they made at firſt, and that by the ſame hand, they
were quite diſcouraged, and placed all their ſafety in their
flight.</p>
                        <p>Finding my ſelf reſcued in that manner from thoſe unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
enemies, though very much weakened by the two wounds
I had received, I made a ſhift to come nearer my deliverer,
to give him thankes for his aſſiſtance; and it happened at the
ſame time, that he, feeling himſelf very much heated, either
by reaſon of the ſultrineſſe of the ſeaſon, or the action he had
been in, put up the viſour of his head-piece to take in a little
freſh aire. I had hardly faſtened my eies on his countenance,
but I was in a manner dazzled by the luſtre and goodlineſſe
of it, and thereupon looking on him a little more earneſtly,
I knew him to be that perſon to whom <hi>I</hi> had been ſo cruelly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious,
the valiant King of <hi>Mauritania.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is impoſſible <hi>I</hi> ſhould repreſent to you the confuſion I
was in, to find my ſelf obliged for my life to a Prince whom
<hi>I</hi> had ſo baſely abuſed and to ſee that Fortune ſhould, after
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:97242:175"/>
ſo ſtrange a manner, direct to my relief that perſon from whom
of all men <hi>I</hi> had leaſt reaſon to expect it. An adventure ſo
unexpected could not but tie up my tongue for a while, and
ſtifling the diſcourſe <hi>I</hi> intended to diſburthen my ſelf of by
way of acknowledgement for the deliverance <hi>I</hi> was obliged to
him for, I ſtood ſtill before him, mute, immoveable, and in
the poſture of a man whom an exceſſe of remorſe had depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of all confidence. And it was certainly from my remorſe,
rather than any fear, that this proceeded, as not knowing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the injury <hi>I</hi> had done him, was come to his knowledge;
but if <hi>I</hi> was aſtoniſhed to ſee him, he was no leſſe to meet
with me, and calling me to mind by the idaea's he had ſtill in
his memory of my countenance, and haply confirmed by the
aſtoniſhment he obſerved in it, he ſtood ſtill, as well as my
ſelf, like one loſt in ſuſpence and irreſolution. At laſt, the
paſſion which produced that effect in him being much different
from that which had put me into ſo great diſturbance, he ſoon
recovered himſelf, and having viewed me with much more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe
then before; <q>Are not you Voluſius, <hi>ſaid he to me,</hi>
ſometime Praetor of <hi>Mauritania?</hi>
                           </q> 
                           <q>I am the very ſame Volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,
<hi>anſwered I,</hi> who am now obliged to you twice for this
wretched life, as having once received it with my liberty, as
a demonſtration of your generoſity, and being obliged to you
for it now by the relief I have received from you when I
was reduced to the laſt extremities. You might have added
to that, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> that you are the ſame <hi>Voluſius,</hi> who being once
before obliged to me for your life and liberty, have never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
made me the moſt unfortunate man in the world, and by
your perfidiouſneſſe have occaſioned me the loſſe of <hi>Cleopatra's</hi>
affection, my kingdome, and whatever ſhould make me in love
with life.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>This reproach put me to ſuch a loſſe, that I knew not what
anſwer to make, whereupon caſting my eies on the ground with
an action expreſſing the greatneſſe of my confuſion, I ſatisfied
the Prince that I had nothing by way of juſtification to ſay for
my ſelf. When he had looked on me for ſome time in that poſture;
<q>What injury ſoever I may have received from you, <hi>ſaid he to
me,</hi> it troubles me not that I have been the occaſion that you
are yet alive; but certainly, 'tis a viſible example of Heavens
juſtice to reſerve the revenge of your perfidiouſneſſe to me
who have been moſt injured thereby. Reaſſume the confidence
which the conſcience of your crime ſeems to have deprived you
of, and ſince I have ſeen you defend your life with courage
enough againſt diverſe men at the ſame time, muſter up all
you have, to defend it againſt one man alone, and give me
not occaſion, by a feeble reſiſtance, to bluſh at the defeat of a
man of inconſiderable valour. Do not imagine I ſhall make uſe
of the advantage I have over you, though the nature of the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:97242:176"/>
injury you have done me might very well induce me to wave
that conſideration; and ſince you have nothing about you but
abare ſword I ſhall put off this armour, which if I ſhould keep

                        </p>
                        <p>With thoſe words he caſt off his head-piece and buckler, and

himſelf for voluntary death rather than a combate;
<q>My Lord, <hi>ſaid I to him,</hi> If theſe little remainders of life I

without any difficulty take them, nay, though I were much
more in love with it then I am, you ſhould never ſee me defend
it againſt you. This is the ſecond time that I receive it as your
gift, and therefore preſent you with nothing but what was
yours before, when I ſacrifice it to your juſt indignation.
Beſides, ſhould I endeavour the reſiſtance which you would
have me undertake, I have not ſtrength to beare me out in it,
for I ſind my ſpirits iſſuing out with my blood with ſuch haſt,
that it is with ſome difficulty they afford me the leaſure to

you may well take a juſt revenge on me, but not expect an
honourable victory. Nor indeed is it from the ruine of a

your weapon through a breaſt which I lay open to you, and
which I offer up to your indignation, without any other regret
than that of an incapacity to make you better ſatisfaction for the
miſchief I have been the occaſion of, and the injury I have done
you.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>While I ſpoke to this effect, the Prince perceiving my counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
grew more and more pale, and that my blood ran down
along my cloaths in abundance, not onely moderated his juſt
diſpleaſure, which would have armed him againſt me; but, paſſing
from one extream into another, with a generoſity that is never
met with in any ſoule but ſuch as his, he ſeemed in a manner
aſhamed that he had been ſo ready to engage a man to ſight
that was weakened by ſo great wounds. Whereupon, compaſſion
forcing its paſſage into that truely-royall heart through thoſe
barricadoes of paſſion which for ſome time had oppoſed it, he
became tenderly moved at the wretchedneſſe of my condition,
and, looking on me with a countenance, wherein there was not
any thing legible of his indignation; <q>Voluſius, <hi>ſaid he to me,</hi>
the injury you have done me is of ſuch a high nature that it is
not to be ſatisfied with light reparations; but it is not in the
condition you are now in that I can take my revenge on you;
nor indeed have I been wont to fight my enemies when they
are weakened by wounds, and incapable to defend themſelves.
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:97242:176"/>
Far be it from me to take thoſe remainders of life you offer
me, ſince that though you had many whole lives to give me,
'twere but little by way of reparation for thoſe cruell loſſes
which I have ſuffered by your meanes.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>With theſe words, out of a miraculous exceſſe of goodneſſe,
he commanded his Eſquire to help me off my horſe, to view my
wounds and to ſtop my blood if it were poſſible, The officious
Eſquire immediately obeyed his Maſters command, and having
torne off ſome linnen from his owne cloathes, he endeavoured
to ſtop the blood which ran in abundance from my two wounds,
and to recover me ſo far as that I might get hither, being not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
many ſtadia's.</p>
                        <p>After I had received that aſſiſtance from him, turning to the
Prince, who looked on the good office he did me without any
expreſſion of animoſity; <q>My Lord, <hi>ſaid I to him,</hi> this mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
goodneſſe of yours does in a manner multiply my crime,
and forces a grief upon me, ſuch as I ſhall not be able to
ſhake off, but by the hope I am in, that the arrowes which
the ſence of my crime thruſts into my breaſt, will ere long
put a period to my life. The gods know, that the remorſe I
conceived at that was the onely thing which brought it into
the hazard wherein you have ſeen it, and if I had not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
to <hi>Tiberius</hi> a regret for the offence I had committed,
and to <hi>Theocles</hi> a horrour for his perfidiouſneſſe, they had
never plotted that againſt me, which no doubt but this latter
was to put in execution, as well to ſatisfie his own reſentments
as to obey the orders of <hi>Tiberius.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Prince interrupting me at theſe words, entreated me to
clear up a little more that which I had ſaid ſomewhat obſcurely.
Whereupon, to ſatisfie him, I made him abrief relation of what
I have repeated to you more at large, as well in relation to the
inſtructions we had obſerved in the carrying on of the treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
deſigne we had upon you, as to what had happened to me
from my departure out of <hi>Mauritania</hi> to our then meeting.
And when I was come to the cloſe of my diſcourſe, I ſhewed
him the perfidious <hi>Theocles,</hi> who had newly breathed his laſt,
and whom the gods by the miracles of their providence had reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to die by his hands, as a reward of the horrid attempt he had
made upon his life.</p>
                        <p>The ſon of <hi>Juba</hi> was very much aſtoniſhed at the wickedneſſe of
<hi>Theocles,</hi> whoſe face he knew, though ſomewhat dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>igured by death
At laſt when I perceived that he was, what by my words, what by
my deportment, perſwaded I was truely ſorry forwhat I had done,
<q>I am very unfortunate, <hi>ſaid I to him,</hi> that I can do ſo little in
order to any reparation for my crime, and all the favour I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of the gods, is, that they would continue me the light of this
life, but till ſuch time as that I have acquainted the Princeſſe
<hi>Cleopatra</hi> and Prince <hi>Marcellus</hi> with the cruell abuſe we have
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:97242:177"/>
put upon them. I ſhall give them an account of the whole tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action,
and will acknowledge it to all the World to my laſt gaſp.
In a word, I ſhall endeavour to reſtore you to that innocence,
which I have been the occaſion that you have loſt in the opinion
of men, and I wiſh my bloud ſpent upon no juſter an account
then that of reſtoring you to that kingdom, which I ſometime
maintained ſo poorly againſt you. Accept, from a miſerable
wretch, of what you can get for the expiation of his perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
ſince you will not take thoſe poor remainders of life he
offered you, and which ſhould have been ſacrificed to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe words were accompanied by ſo many expreſſions of a
real and ſincere repentance, that the Prince, abſolutely ſatisfied
that I was truely ſenſible of the hainouſneſſe of my crime, was
extreamly moved at it himſelf by the diſcoveries I had made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Whereupon having continued ſilent a little while, as it were
to recollect himſelf, and to conſider what he had to ſay to me;
<hi>Voluſius, ſaid he,</hi> I heartily forgive you, the miſchief you have
done me, and am ſatisfied with the death of this perſidious
ſubject, whom the gods, by a miraculous conduct of their
juſtice had reſerved to periſh by my hands, when I leaſt expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it. I refuſe not the proffer you make me to give an account
of my innocence to <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and <hi>Marcellus.</hi> I am confident
they have already entertained ſome apprehenſions thereof, and
it will be your buſineſſe to rid them of all thoſe which may be
yet remaining in them of the infidelity wherewith I have been
charged. I imagine not but that my juſtification is of as great
concernment to me as the recovery of my kingdom. I have
made a ſhift to live without a Kingdom, aſſured of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Cleopatra;</hi> but I would not be burthened with the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Kingdom, when I have been abhorred by <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> I
ſhall entreat you to tell both the Princeſſe and <hi>Marcellus,</hi> that
I had deſerved they ſhould have made a ſtricter inquiſition into
my crime, and conſequently been more concerned in my vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
before they had condemned me with ſo much ſeverity;
and that they ſhould both of them have debated the buſineſſe a
little on my behalf, againſt apparences uncertain enough. How
do I acknowledge my ſelf obliged to the gods that they have
ordered things ſo, as that, before my death, I may let them know,
I have not been perfidious either to my Miſtreſſe or my Friend,
and that, ſince I have recovered my ſelf from their reproaches
by truth, they ſhall never hear of thoſe which I might make to
them, meerly out of the love and reſpect which I ſhall have for
them to the very laſt breath. Onely you will be pleaſed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
the Princeſſe to remember her ſelf, that, notwithſtanding
my innocence, notwithſtanding my juſtification, I am no longer
worthy to ſerve her, and that, though I might hope the recovery
of her affections, yet durſt I not preſume to deſire they ſhould
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:97242:177"/>
be caſt away on a wretch, perſecuted by heaven and a croſſe
fortune, and one who hath not, all over the earth, any place he
may call his own. Further, that time hath been I might, through
the friendſhip and aſſiſtance of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> have hoped to be reſtored
to a condition not much different from that of my Anceſtors;
that after I had loſt <hi>Caeſars</hi> friendſhip, I had recovered a Kingdom
wherein ſhe ſhould have reigned, had the gods and my cruel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny
been ſo pleaſed: But that now, being diſpoſſeſſed of all, all
aſſiſtance, all protection, and all hope, it is not fit I ſhould lift
up my eies on a Princeſſe, whom the greateſt Kings upon earth
would think it a glory to ſerve, nor indeed ſo much as wiſh my
ſelf beloved by her, ſince ſhe cannot affect me but upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of her own unhappineſſe, by involving her ſelf in the
miſerable deſtiny of the moſt unfortunate of mankind; That
all I have to do now, is to dy, ſo to put a worthy Period to this
Tragedy, and that I ſhall be able to do, either by laying violent
hands on my ſelf, after the example of the King my father, or
by <hi>Caeſars</hi> wrath, whereto I ſhall expoſe my ſelf without the
leaſt fear, after I have offered up to my ill fortune a victime
which I am obliged to ſacrifice to her. That after that action,
whatever may be the event of it, I ſhall endeavour to forbear
diſturbing the enjoyments of a perſon that is a thouſand times
dearer to me then the life which I beſtow to further them; and
laſtly, that I make it my earneſt ſuit to the gods that they never
be interrupted by the memory of a wretch, whoſe remembrance
might haply occaſion ſome diſturbance in the felicities I wiſh her.
With thoſe words reaching forth his hand to me, he bad me fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well;
and having commanded his Squire to help me up on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back
again to come for <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in order to the cure of my
wounds, he took another way, and left me, much more troubled
at his diſcourſe and the action of it, then I was at the danger and
pain of my wounds.</p>
                        <p>Being gotten on horſe-back again by the aſſiſtance of his Squire,
I took my way towards this City, much about the ſetting of the
Sun, and came into it before it was quite dark, ſo weakened, that
I was hardly able to ſtand. As to what hath paſſed ſince, I ſhall
not trouble you. I was kindly entertained by <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who was
my ancient friend, and ſeemed to be very much troubled at my
misfortune; but it was not in his power to hinder me, out of any
conſideration of health, which he preſſed very much, from leaving
my bed, aſſoon as ever I underſtood, Madam, I might have acceſſe
to you, to acquit my ſelf of the charge I had taken upon
me: and to clear to you and Prince <hi>Marcellus,</hi> the innocency of a
Prince, who was never guilty of any thing but by the artifices of
<hi>Tiberius</hi> and our combination, and who cannot juſtly b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with any thing either as to his Miſtreſſe or his Friend, but
is the moſt conſtant and moſt generous of all men living. I
acknowledge the goodneſſe of the gods in the favour they
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:97242:178"/>
have done me to acquaint you with this truth before I dy, and
humbly beg it of them, that this diſcovery, which, proceeding
from a real repentance I now make to you, may in ſome meaſure
be thought a reparation of my crime. It hath produced effects too
too important, and too too deplorable for me to hope any pardon
from you, though I have obtained it from him, who hath been
the greateſt ſufferer thereby, and whom I had offended moſt;
but I fear me, I have received my puniſhment from thoſe that
were my co-agents in it, and that I ſhall not long ſurvive the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of an action which muſt needs make me abominable in the
ſight of all the World.</p>
                        <p>Thus did <hi>Voluſius</hi> put a Period to his diſcourſe; and though
that towards the end of it he obſerved in the countenances of
<hi>Cleopatra</hi> and <hi>Marcellus</hi> more compaſſion and grief then reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or indignation againſt him, yet, were it that he could not
any longer endure the preſence of perſons whom he had ſo highly
injured, or that his wounds troubled him, he would not make any
longer ſtay in the chamber, and, with ſome difficulty, making a ſhift
to riſe off the chair he was ſate in, after he had, by a geſture full
of humility, and the expreſſions of his grief, taken his leave of
the Prince and Princeſſe, he paſſed into the outer-room, where he
found the perſons which <hi>Cornelius</hi> had left there to bring him back
to his lodgings.</p>
                        <p>It were no eaſie matter to repreſent what poſture <hi>Marcellus</hi> and
<hi>Cleopatra</hi> were in, upon this relation of <hi>Voluſius.</hi> They were at
the ſame time ſubject to ſuch a diſtraction of thoughts, that it
had been ſome difficulty to unravel them, and to make their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
capable of ſome order. Yet is it certain, that their firſt
apprehenſions were thoſe of joy, and that neither of them could,
without being infinitely glad, entertain the news, that <hi>Coriolanus</hi>
had ever been a conſtant lover, and a faithful friend, and that
they could not any longer doubt of that innocence which
they ſo much wiſhed. They looked one upon another during this
firſt apprehenſion, and in their countenances expreſſed their
mutual ſatisfaction. <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> as the moſt concerned in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſpoke firſt, and letting the Prince read in her eies what her
heart was ſo full of; <q>Well Brother, <hi>ſaid ſhe to him,</hi> you ſee that
<hi>Coriolanus</hi> is innocent, and that it was not without ſome ground
that I was ſatisfied of it, before I had underſtood ſo much from
the mouth of <hi>Voluſius.</hi> I acknowledge the indulgence of the
gods, <hi>replies Marcellus,</hi> as great towards me in this, as in the
greateſt favour they ever did me; and I take them to witneſſes,
that what you and <hi>Voluſius</hi> have perſwaded me to of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
of <hi>Julia,</hi> hath not cauſed in me ſuch a ſatisfaction as what
I have underſtood of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>idelity of <hi>Coriolanus.</hi> How, <hi>replyed
the Princeſſe, with a certain tranſportation not ſuitable to her
ordinary moderation,</hi> it is then infallible, that <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> whoſe
pretended infidelity coſt me ſo many tears, hath ever been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:97242:178"/>
to his <hi>Cleopatra;</hi> and that Princeſſe, who, by her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſion
thought her ſelf condemned to eternal afflictions,
may now re-aſſume thoſe joies and hopes ſhe had before broke
off all acquaintance with?</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here would ſhe have taken occaſion to open her ſoul for the
reception of a paſſion, which, of a long time, had not had any
entertainment there: but that joy was ſoon eclipſed by an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of grief, and a certain reflection which filled her heart
with all the ſadneſſe it was capable of, when ſhe thought on her
cruel dep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rtment towards that Prince, the deplorable effect it had
produced, as having proved the occaſion of the loſſe of his Crown,
and of all her hopes, and that fatal reſolution which he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
to <hi>Voluſius,</hi> that he intended to take, and whereof he had
given her ſome notice at their laſt parting. In a word, being thus
convinced of his fidelity, ſhe could not call to mind the cruel
entertainment ſhe had made him at <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> when, enflamed to
the higheſt pitch of love, and thinking it a thouſand times more
glorious to be her ſervant, then what ſo noble a conqueſt, and the
recovery of his Kingdoms had made him, he had paſſed through
thouſands of dangers, to come and offer her thoſe very Kingdoms;
ſhe could not think on the cruel and injurious ſpeeches wherewith
ſhe had received him, and the ſad condition wherein ſhe had left
him, without a mortal wound in that heart which nothing but
the love of that Prince could ever make any impreſſion in.</p>
                        <p>From that doleful reflection, calling to mind, how ſhe had met
him in the Woods of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the day that he relieved her
with greater valour then ſucceſſe, againſt thoſe that afterwards
carried her away, and laſtly remembring the meeting ſhe had had
with him in the King of <hi>Armenia's</hi> ſhip, whereof ſhe repreſented
to her ſelf all the particulars, after another manner then they
had appeared to her, while ſhe was ſtill prepoſſeſſed by her cruel
miſtake, as well out of a conſideration of that long ſwounding,
into which her ſight and words had put him, as the diſcourſe, full
of a generous confidence he had made to her, and the admirable
reſolution he had taken and gone through with, by ſighting alone
for her liberty, againſt ſo great a number of enemies, with ſuch
prodigious valour, and by the laſt words he had ſpoken to her at
their parting, wherein, as well as in his actions, his innocency was
but too too apparent. And from theſe things, whereof her eies
had been but too too faithful witneſſes, diverting her thoughts
to others that were of no leſſe conſequence, ſuch as the loſſe of a
great Kingdom which he had conquered for her, and which he
neglected to maintain, through the deſpair ſhe had reduced him
to; that which he had expreſſed when he caſt himſelf into the ſea,
becauſe he would not ſurvive his diſgrace, and the ſhame he
thought it, that he was not able to reſcue her from her Raviſhers;
the miſerable condition he was brought to, having no place of
refuge, no relief, nor any comfort in the World, and laſtly, the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:97242:179"/>
reſolution he had diſcovered to <hi>Voluſius</hi> and her ſelf, of his unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe
to have her any longer engaged in his misfortunes, and
to ſeek out the remedies thereof onely in death, which, for a
courage, ſuch as his was, it would not be hard to find; ſhe could
not faſten her thoughts on all theſe truths, which were but too
importunate upon her memory, without giving way to ſuch a
grief, as neither all her own great conſtancy, nor yet the joy ſhe
conceived at the innocence of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> were able to abate.</p>
                        <p>After ſhe had for ſome time ſmothered the diſordered agitations
ſhe was in, being not able to hold out any longer, and conceiving
ſhe might freely diſburthen her ſelf before <hi>Marcellus,</hi> whom ſhe
was confident of, and whoſe ſoul, during that time, was perſecuted
by imaginations much of the ſame nature; <q>
                              <hi>Coriolanus</hi> is inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
<hi>ſaid ſhe, breaking forth into a rivulet of tears:</hi> But, O ye
heavenly powers! ſuch is my cruel deſtiny, that <hi>Coriolanus</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be innocent, but I muſt at the ſame time be the moſt criminal
perſon in the World. That Prince, the moſt amiable, the moſt
generous, and the moſt vertuous of men, hath continued invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olately
conſtant to me, and hath ſtill perſiſted in the ſame perfect
affection, which had at firſt taken in my ſoul; and yet, unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
wretch that I am, I have had the cruelty to baniſh him
my preſence as a Monſter; I have had the inhumanity to ſee
him in a manner expiring at my feet, and never could be moved
at it; and I have at laſt reduced him to ſuch extremities, as have
proved the occaſion of looſing that Kingdom which he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
for me, have made him a reſtleſſe vagabond all over the
earth, made him ſeek out precipices, and now make him reſolve
to ſeek in death a Period of theſe deplorable miſeries, into
which I, onely I, have brought him. O <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> unfortunate
<hi>Cleopatra!</hi> what pretence of joy canſt thou find in the juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> ſince it muſt needs expoſe thee to the moſt
cruel regrets that ever perſecuted guilty ſouls? It were much
more for thy ſatisfaction, at leaſt, if it were not for thy ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it would be much more to thy advantage, that thy <hi>Coriolanus</hi>
had been found unconſtant, and that thou ſhouldſt be found
innocent thy ſelf; and ſince that thy innocence and his are things
inconſiſtent, either he ought to be guilty, or thou have continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the miſpriſion which thou hadſt been perſwaded to. O
cruel <hi>Voluſius!</hi> cruel in thy malice, and cruel in thy remorſe,
thou art in both equally the meſſenger of death to me, and I find
fatal poiſon in this appearance of life which thou bringſt me,
when thou telleſt me that <hi>Coriolanus</hi> is conſtant to me. Let us
then, till death, bewaile the misfortune which attends us as well
in the one as in the other condition, and never entertain any
comfort, ſince that is a kind of happineſſe which guilty ſouls are
never to expect.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here the tears interrupted the courſe of her ſpeech, and fell
from her in ſuch abundance, that ſhe was forced to allow them a
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:97242:179"/>
free paſſage, and to let them expreſſe ſome part of what ſhe felt
within her. In that interval ſhe repented her of her laſt reflections,
and aſſoon as ſhe was in a condition to reaſſume her diſcourſe;
<q>I crave thy pardon, <hi>ſaid ſhe, with a voice imperfectly accented with
ſobs,</hi> I crave thy pardon, faithful Prince, for ſo unjuſt an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,
and what ever I may fear from my own remorſe, and the
reproaches thou maiſt juſtly make me, yet muſt I needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that it is more ſatisfactory to me, nay a thouſand times
more ſatisfactory to me, to be found criminal by thy innocence,
then to be found innocent by thy infidelity, for I ſet ſuch a value
on thy affection, that nothing can repair the loſſe of it, nor
counterballance the happineſſe it were to me to recover it. I am
content to be thought guilty of all that the artifices of my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
have occaſioned me to commit, and ſhall not ſeek for any
excuſe, either in my errour or my repentance, but onely flatter
my ſelf with this comfort, that thou haſt ever loved me, loveſt
me now, and wilt love me to the laſt gaſp. It is not therefore in
thy juſtification that I would be thought unfortunate, becauſe then
the guilt lies on my ſide; but I acknowledge my ſelf unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in the ingratitude I have expreſſed towards thee, in the
misfortunes I have occaſioned thee, in the irrecoverable loſſes I
have cauſed thee, and the cruel reſolutions I have forced thee
upon. It was by my means, that, at <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> thou wert
reduced to thoſe extremities that brought thy life into danger;
upon my account haſt thou loſt a Kingdom, which thou didſt
deſign for me, thou haſt ſpent thy daies in wandring up and
down the World with much miſery, thou haſt ſought death a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Waves, and thou art ſtill reſolved to run thy ſelf upon
death, meerly becaſe thou wouldſt not, either by thy preſence
or memory, diſturb the enjoiments thou wiſheſt me. Ah <hi>Corio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus,</hi>
tis in that reſolution thou art unjuſt and cruel, no leſſe then
I have been, and thou oughteſt not, by looſing thy own
life, imagine to adde any thing to my happineſſe, ſince it is from
thee alone that all the happineſſe of my life is derived. Thou
haſt but little acquaintance with <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> if thou canſt think
the loſſe of thy Kingdom able to abate any thing of the value
I ſet on thee; I have ever preferred thy perſon before all the
Monarchies of the World, and, ſuppoſing the condition thou art
reduced to as miſerable as can be imagined, I would run fortunes
with thee with no leſſe ſatisfaction then if thou hadſt the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
at thy diſpoſal. Do not therefore court thy own death,
<hi>Coriolanus,</hi> if thou doſt it not to rid thy hands of an unhappy
woman, whom for her ingratitude thou haſt reaſon to abhor, or

With theſe words ſhe as it were opened the flood-gates to
that grief, which was ready to over-run her, and caſt her ſelf
on her bed, after a moſt pittifull manner, inſomuch that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus,</hi>
who had never ſeen her ſo unable to command her paſſions
being aſtoniſhed at it, and riſing from the place where he ſate,
came to her with an endeavour to recover and comfort her.
<q>Is it poſſible, <hi>Siſter, ſaid he to her,</hi> that ſo unreaſonable a
grief ſhould have ſuch a powerfull influence on your imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
whom <hi>I</hi> have known with ſo much conſtancy reſiſt
the aſſaults of a juſt affliction; and cannot you entertain an
account of <hi>Coriolanus's</hi> innocency with ſome moderation, who
have ſupported his infidelity with ſo much ſettledneſſe and
reſolution? Can it poſſibly come to paſſe, if the affections of
that Prince were ever deare to you, that you ſhould not, with
joy, entertain this change of your condition, and that the
remorſe you conceive at the miſcarriages that have happened
through your miſapprehenſions ſhould have a more powerfull
operation on you, then the aſſurances of a fidelity which you
have wiſhed with more earneſtneſſe than you could have done
any thing relating to your own life? Ah Siſter, if theſe muſt
be the effects of your regretts, let them fall onely upon me
who am ore-burthened with crimes by the engagement <hi>I</hi> have
had in your miſtake, for that it was upon my ſollicitation prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
that you came to hate a Friend, who loved me beyond
himſelf. It was <hi>I</hi> that travelled up and down ſeverall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes

<hi>Artemiſa,</hi> attended by <hi>Alexander.</hi> Aſſoon as this company was
come in, <hi>Marcellus,</hi> who was out of all patience to put the
deſigne he had undertaken in execution, withdrew without
ſpeaking ought to any one, and ſo, that the Princeſſe her ſelf
could not otherwiſe than by a caſt of her countenance expreſſe
how infinitely ſhe thought her ſelf obliged to him for thoſe good
intentions of his. Though ſhe had wiped her eies, yet could
ſhe not hinder but that the three Princeſſes perceived ſhe had
been a-weeping: and in regard they all had a very great affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
for her, and that <hi>Candace</hi> and <hi>Artemiſa</hi> did not look on
her otherwiſe than as an admirable Siſter, and the Princeſſe
of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> as a perſon whoſe incomparable perfections
had powerfully forced her heart and inclinations towards her,
they diſcovered a certain emulation in expreſſing how much they
were troubled for the grief ſhe was in, whereof they ſaw the
markes very freſh in her countenance, and with much precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

them many thanks for thoſe kind demonſtrations of their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and after ſhe had in few words expreſſed the reſentments
ſhe had thereof, turning to the Princeſſe <hi>Artemiſa</hi> who was more
particularly acquainted with the paſſages of her life than the
other two, and had ſometime ſeen <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> and pleaded
very much on his behalf, and conceiving ſhe might ſafely tell
her what it was that lay ſo heavy on her heart, even before the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:97242:181"/>
two other Princeſſes, whom ſhe had not the leaſt ſuſpicion of,
and who were informed, though ſomewhat more confuſedly,
of the moſt important adventures had happened to her; <q>Ah

                           <q>Ah Siſter, how much were you in the right, when you main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
againſt me, that <hi>Coriolanus</hi> was not inconſtant, and with
how much reaſon did you take his part againſt an over-credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
perſon, and one whom her imprudent credulity hath made
guilty of irreparable miſcarriages! 'Tis very certain, Siſter, he
is innocent, and hath been cleared, even by thoſe that were
the authors of the calumny raiſed againſt him. All the crime
and all the remorſe doth now abſolutely fall to my ſhare, and
if you have made any diſcoveries of grief in my countenance it
was the effect of thoſe juſt regrets which I could not but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
thereat.</q>

                           <hi>Artemiſa</hi> ſeemed to be very much moved at this diſcourſe,
and made anſwer to the Princeſſe with very much earneſtneſſe;
<q>But I pray Siſter, <hi>ſaid ſhe to her,</hi> what certainty have you of
the newes you tell me, what ſtronger arguments can you have
received of it, than thoſe you might have derived from the
diſcourſes and actions of <hi>Coriolanus</hi> himſelf, and in a word,
what is it that hath ſo ſtrangely convinced you of a thing,
whereof you would not before admit of any ſatisfaction?</q>
                           <hi>Candace</hi> and <hi>Eliſa,</hi> who, among other remarkeable adventures of
<hi>Coriolanus,</hi> had alſo heard of the pretended infidelity laid to his
charge, thought themſelves concerned in his juſtification, no
leſſe than <hi>Artemiſa</hi> was; and <hi>Alexander,</hi> who had ever had a
very great friendſhip for the perſon, and abundance of reſpect
for the vertue of that Prince, ſeemed to be no leſſe deſirous
to underſtand the truth of that buſineſſe. The faire <hi>Cleopatra</hi>
thought it but juſtice to ſatisfie them all, and perceiving there
were onely thoſe perſons in the chamber, ſhe gave them a brief
relation of all ſhe had heard from <hi>Voluſius,</hi> inſiſting more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
on thoſe paſſages that were of greater conſequence.
So that having by that diſcourſe ſatisfied the noble company
preſent of the innocency of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> they were all extreamly
troubled to underſtand what a deplorable condition that Prince
was reduced to, and the ſad reſolutions he had taken thereupon.
<q>The gods have the praiſe, <hi>cries out the Princeſſe Artemiſa,</hi> for
that they have been pleaſed to confirme a truth which I have
ever maintained, and whereof all vertuous perſons were
obliged to wiſh a perfect diſcovery: I had ever obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

ſhe would repreſent to them, how it troubled her to the very
heart, that ſhe had treated with ſo much rigour a faithfull and
innocent Prince, and had brought him from a throne, into which
he had recovered himſelf, to the wretched condition he then was
in; <hi>Candace</hi> aſſuming the diſcourſe, <q>Madam, <hi>ſaid ſhe to her,</hi>
the very regrett you diſcover for your harſh treatment of the
King of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> is, no doubt, reparation enough to him,
and there needs no more to ſatisfie him and all the world,
than to conſider the apparences whereby you were deceived,
