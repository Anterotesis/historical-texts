            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>Courteous Reader,</p>
            <p>I <hi>Remember a while ago, there was a Question proposed to the <hi>Athenian Society;</hi>
               </hi> Whether Books are not more proper to be given at Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, than Bisquets, Gloves, Rings, <hi>&amp;c. The Answer they returned was:</hi> That un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a Book would be a far more convenient, more durable, and more valuable a Present, than what are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally given, as much exceeding them, as the Soul does the Body; and besides, will much better, and more profitably preserve the <hi>Memory of a Deceased Friend;</hi> if good, teaching him how to follow him; if bad, to avoid his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb facs="tcp:52526:3"/>
that they may escape his End; and the Truths contained therein, we should think, would make a more lasting Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, even than a Sermon it self, much more than a <hi>Dull Deaths-head;</hi> for having always before our Eyes, the Idea of those for whom 'twas given; they'll still (as it were) Preach from the Dead unto us. <hi>Thus far you have the Opinion of the <hi>Athenian Society,</hi> in this Matter. And certainly nothing can more conduce to our eternal Well-fare, and to put us in mind of Mortality, than</hi> Books of this kind; <hi>and to the end they may be more Profitable and Useful to Christians, it were to be wished that this <hi>Mourning-Ring,</hi> which is so Entituled, that it might be given at Funerals, instead of <hi>Gloves, Bisquets, Wine.</hi> And those that think it proper, may Print in a Sheet of Paper, the most Material Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages, in the Life of their</hi> Dead Friend, <hi>and bind it up with those</hi> Mourning-Ring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>they give away at his Funeral; and for the more effectually perpetuating the Memory of the</hi> Party Deceased. <hi>There is room left in the Title of this Book, for inserting his</hi> Name and Place of Burial. <hi>And indeed, all serious practical Books are proper for this Design, and if Bound in <hi>Black,</hi> with a <hi>Cypher</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:52526:3"/>
                  <hi>of Mortality,</hi> (as this <hi>Mourning-Ring,</hi> should be when given at Funerals) will be very decent and proper for such a</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Occasion; <hi>to make the</hi> serious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions <hi>of our Frailty more strong, was I suppose the first Original of <hi>Funeral Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> and for this purpose they are still Printed, that the</hi> consideration of the Dead <hi>may further the Holyness and Salvation of the Living. And doubtless, Reading and Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would be much more decent at such Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, than Eating and Drinking, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on <hi>Gay Attire.</hi> Books of this Subject would make the People mind the</hi> present in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Mortality, <hi>and affect them with devout Meditations thereon. How sad is it to consider the unsuitable Carriage, of a great many Persons at Funerals; those oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities are usually spent in</hi> idle Chat, <hi>in Eating and Drinking, and that sometimes to Excess, so that the</hi> House of Weeping is turned into a House of Mirth and Feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Many have put in Practice this useful Design of giving Books at the Interment of Friends, which if it were more general, the good Effect thereof would be soon discerned. in the Lives of Christians; for it may be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be said of a Book, given at <hi>Funerals,</hi> as Divine</hi> Herbert <hi>says of a Verse,</hi> viz.
<pb facs="tcp:52526:4"/>
A Book may find him who a Sermon flies, And turn a Gift into a Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When Christians</hi> attend at Funerals, <hi>and sit over Graves, and are amused with the doleful</hi> Passing-Bell, <hi>and look upon Skulls, and dead Bones, and Ghastly Spectacles, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the dropping Eyes and despondent <hi>Looks of Mourners,</hi> they have, if ever, some suitable self-humbling Apprehensions of their own Mortality, which wou'd abide with 'em by a frequent perusal of such a Treatise as this which, puts them in mind of their</hi> departed Friends, <hi>and serves as</hi> King <hi>Philip</hi>'s Boy, <hi>who saluted him every Morning with a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Sir you are a Man.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>There are no Ingredients in the Shop of Nature that are a sufficient Cordial to forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Heart against this King of Terrors or his Harbingers: The Velvet slipper cannot fence the Foot from the Gout, nor the Gold Ring the Finger from a Fellon; the richest Diadem cannot quit the Head-ach, nor the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Robe prevent a Fever; Beauty, Strength, Riches, Honour, Friends, nor any, nor all</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:52526:4"/>
               <hi>can repeal that sentence,</hi> Dust thou art<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to Dust thou shalt return. <hi>Every Fit of an Ague, and every Distemper of this frail Constitution being as a light Skirmish before the main Battle of Death, wherein weak Man being vanquished, is led Captive to his <hi>long home:</hi> And when once the Lines of Mortality are drawn upon the</hi> Face of the fairest Mortal, <hi>he becomes a ghastly Spectacle (how lovely soever before) and the conclusion is,</hi> Bury my Dead out of my sight. <hi>This inevitable necessity, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it be confesled and acknowledged of all; yet lamentable experience teacheth that in the Christian World most Men so live as though they should never die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now, That we may be fitted to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with this last Enemy</hi> (besides the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold helps which God hath reached to us in his Word, in the Passages of his Providence, in the frequent Examples of Mortality before us continually, and in our own sensible Approaches to the Gates of Death: <hi>I say, besides these and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite more,) this</hi> Mourning-Ring, <hi>by Gods blessing, and our endeavours, may prove no small furtherance in our Pilgrimage. The</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:52526:5"/>
               <hi>whole Work being the most <hi>Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive history of Death,</hi> and <hi>Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Monuments,</hi> yet extant; each</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>and</hi> Meditation <hi>therein is as a</hi> several Legacy, <hi>bequeathed by those upon the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of whose</hi> Deaths <hi>they were written, as by so many Testators, who themselves have made</hi> a real Experiment of Mortality, <hi>and left these for our Instruction that survive ve them. It is true, the dayly Examples of Mortality are so many</hi> real Lectures <hi>that by a kind of</hi> Dumb Oratory, <hi>perswade us to expect our</hi> End, <hi>but as they are Transcient, so our Thoughts of them Vanish. Therefore, it can be no small Advantage to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways before us, this <hi>Mourning Ring,</hi> which will abundantly furnish us with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations in this kind, and be still constantly putting of us in Mind of our</hi> Departed Friend.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It was a</hi> Custom <hi>in former times for</hi> Great Men <hi>to make them Sepulchres in their Gardens, to mind them of Death, in the midst of the Pleasures of this Life. This</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Work <hi>may not unfitly be termed a Garden, wherein whosoever takes a</hi> dayly walk, <hi>will find that Titles of Honour are written in Dust,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:52526:5"/>
               <hi>and that</hi> Princes <hi>and Great Men must Die; that their very</hi> Monuments <hi>are</hi> Mortal, <hi>and will in time be found as</hi> Archemedes <hi>his</hi> Tomb <hi>(by</hi> Cicero) in vepretis, <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown with</hi> Thorns and Briars: <hi>And that even</hi> Poor Men <hi>too, (who have no Comet, Prodigy, or Earthquake to Toll the Knell of their Departure.) But who do as it were steal into their silent Graves with no</hi> greater noise <hi>than can be made by a</hi> Branch of Rosemary, Sprig of Lawrel, or a Black Ribband, <hi>have Precious and Immortal Souls to save as well as they</hi> with the Methods and Courses <hi>both should take to get Saving Grace, and the Knowledge of Christ, which will prove a Possession for them to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In a word, be thy Estate and Condition what it will be, here thou maist have both</hi> Directions <hi>to guide thee, and</hi> Comforts <hi>to support thee in thy Journey on Earth, till thou arrive at thy Heavenly Countrey.</hi>

               <hi>The Author of this <hi>Mourning-Ring,</hi> spent a great part of his Time in Holy and Devout Contemplations upon the things of another Life as this Excellent Piece of his sufficiently shews.</hi>

               <hi>His great Care was so to fit and prepare himself for a Happy Death whilst in the World, that after this Life ended he might enjoy Eternal Happiness in that which is to come.

                  <p>The occasion of this text is known unto you; in the beginning of this Chapter you read that <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> was sick, and the news thereof immediatly sent to <hi>Jesus;</hi> who notwithstanding he dearly loved him, yet (as the sequel of the story acquaints you) he doth not presently go up to <hi>Bethany</hi> to visit sick <hi>Lazarus.</hi> but maketh a stay for several days; the reason wherof is at hand, <hi>viz.</hi> That a sentence of death might pass upon beloved <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> and he be laid in the <hi>grave,</hi> and a stone rouled upon him; and all this in order to the manifestation of the glory and power of Christ in his resurrection.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Lazarus</hi> had been in the grave four days, Christ he comes up to <hi>Bethany,</hi> and the sisters of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> viz, <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> they come out to meet <hi>Jesus;</hi> first <hi>Martha</hi> she cometh, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. and she saith, <hi>Lord If thou hadst been here, my brother had not died,</hi> ver. 21. After this comes <hi>Mary,</hi> vers. 32 and she falls down at Christs feet, saying, <hi>Lord If thou hadst been here, my brother, had not died. When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the Spirit. and was troubled, and said, Where have ye laid him? They say unto him, Lord, come and see.</hi>

                  <head>Jesus wept.</head>
                  <p>There is very much wrapt up in the bowels of this <hi>little Text:</hi> Here we may take notice
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52526:20"/>
of the humanity of Christ; it appears by Christs <hi>weeping</hi> that he is perfect man, as well as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect God: That <hi>Christ wept,</hi> is to be referred, not to his Divinity, but to his Humanity; and so we shall find that Christ was subject as to this, so to all <hi>natural infirmities; as hunger, thirst weariness,</hi> &amp;c. which may comfort the Saints that groan under natural, as well as sinful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities; and that from the reason why Christ was made in all things like unto his brethren; namely, <hi>That he might be a merciful High-priest, Hebr.</hi> 2. 17, 18. And though Christ be now in glory, yet he is touched with the feeling of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of his people here on earth, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4. 15. so touched, as that he cannot but have <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion on them</hi> under all their pressures and grievances whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>Do'st thou then groan under natural weaknesses <hi>and infirmities? Go boldly to the Throne of grace,</hi> and Christ will enable thee to bear up under these weaknesses, until <hi>mortality shall have put on immortality.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Subject Matter of this Chapter is <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus redivivus;</hi> it is a Relation of the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous raising up of <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the Dead.</p>
                  <p>From vers. 1, 3. we may observe thus much, that a Believers interest in the distinguishing love of Christ, doth not exempt him from outward Troubles or bodily Distempers: <hi>He whom thou lovest is sick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From vers. 4. We may observe thus much, that the darkest Dispensations of Providence, they oftentimes usher in the brightest manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God to the Soul, or Gods Glory is most manifested in the Creatures Weakness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:52526:21"/>
From Vers. 6. We may take notice, it was ever in Christ's intention to manifest his Love and Goodness to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and yet he comes not near him for the present, but rather goes away and leaves him upon his sick Bed, and suffers him at last to give up the Ghost.</p>
                  <p>From Vers. 14. We may observe, that Christ his absence or the suspension of divine Grace and Love, they are in infinite Wisdom ordered for the further advancing of Soul Comfort. Had not <hi>Lazarus</hi> been sick, had he not been dead and buryed, the Wisdom, Power and Goodness of Christ had never been so eminently discovered as it was towards him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> cry out, <hi>v.</hi> 21, 32. <hi>Lord, if thou hadst been here our Brother had not died;</hi> It is true, Christ might have recovered <hi>Lazarus</hi> upon his sick-bed; but to fetch him out of the Grave after he had lain stinking four days, was a higher demonstration of his Love, Wisdom, and Power. There is not the like ground that Christ should shew forth his miraculous Power, in raising up our dead Friends from the Grave, as was then; yet this special and useful conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion may by way of Analogy, be deduced from this instance; namely,</p>
                  <p>That such Comforts and Mercies as are fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Grave, as have had a sentence of Death pass'd upon them, they are ever sweetest, and tend most to Gods Glory. <hi>Isaac</hi> had never been so precious to his Father <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> had he not been so miraculously restored from dying, as he was once.</p>
                  <p>But we shall hasten to see what is the cause of Christ his weeping, and what the cause was, you may see, ver. 32, 33, 34, 35, 36. when Christ saw <hi>Mary</hi> come weeping towards him, having her
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52526:21"/>
heart running over with Grief, for the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of her Brother, Christ groaned in Spirit, and was troubled; when they told him where <hi>dead Lazarus lay,</hi> he wept (as my Text expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth.)</p>

                     <hi>Oh Men and Angels, stand and wonder</hi> to all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity! When you read these two words, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus wept.</hi> What, doth <hi>Mary</hi>'s weeping set Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ a weeping? Doth <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi> shed Tears for the Death of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and doth Christ his Heart even bleed within him to see them troubled and mourning upon the same account; so the word in the Greek seems to import, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, he troubled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; his own heart stirred up his Affections to be troubled. Doth Christ weep upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of <hi>Lazarus</hi> Death? Then hence we may learn, that a moderate sorrowing for Friends departed is lawful, tho excessive Sorrow is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unsuitable to a Gospel Frame of Spirit. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> tells us, There is a <hi>time for Weeping,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, We should weep as though we wept not.</p>
                  <p>But to come to the thing I chiefly intend, and that is the occasion of <hi>Christs weeping,</hi> which was the death of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> a good man: whence I shall observe and prosecute this Doctrine:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That it is a Christ-like temper of mind, to be deeply affected with, and to weep over the death of such as are truly pious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here's <hi>Lazarus</hi> a good man in his grave, and <hi>Christ he weeps</hi> over him: you have a weeping Christ over a dead <hi>Lazarus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When old <hi>Jacob</hi> an eminent person was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, it's said <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. 10. <hi>That they mourned with a great and sore lamentation,</hi> and that for 7 days
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52526:22"/>
together. And so when <hi>Moses</hi> died, and was buried by a secret hand, it's said <hi>the Children of Israel mourned for him</hi> 30 <hi>days,</hi> Deut. 34. 8.</p>
                  <p>My dearly beloved, you have lost a <hi>Moses,</hi> one that was valiant for God in former times, when the people of God in <hi>England</hi> were coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and he hath been an eminent lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the saints in their wilderness state, and God did often take him to the top of <hi>Pisgah,</hi> and gave him there glorious visions, and that not onely of heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> but also of that glorious land of rest and righteousness that the Saints shall injoy in this world. Now that such a <hi>Moses</hi> should be taken off in the Wilderness, while the people of God are yet short of this good Land, is matter of great humiliation.</p>
                  <p>Likewise you find the same spirit in those Christians, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. that <hi>Paul</hi> (the great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle of the Gentiles) did there take his fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel of, saying, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. <hi>And now behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.</hi> It's said, 37, 38 verses, <hi>And they all wept sore, and fell on Pauls neck, and kissed him: Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake [that they should see his face no more.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now by all this it appears, that it is both the duty and property of a Christian <hi>(such an one as hath been baptized into the spirit of Jesus)</hi> to be deeply affected with, and <hi>weep</hi> over, the death of such as are truly pious, especially when they are eminent for use and service to Christ, and his people.</p>
                  <p>We shall now give you the reasons why it is so, and cannot be otherwise, but that gracious
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52526:22"/>
persons must needs weep over the death of good men.</p>
                  <p>First, Because every stroke in this kind, puts a <hi>serious heart</hi> in mind of its own mortality, tells us that we are dying creatures, and that's a very serious consideration to every awakened soul. <hi>The living, the living will lay it to heart,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccl. 7. 2. <hi>Alas my Brethren 'tis a serious thing to dye.</hi> And the stroke of death upon others, tells us that die we must, and how soon we know not: <hi>This Evening sun may see us dead,</hi> it went out Early this morning to score us out this <hi>lodging of a Tomb.</hi> And oh happy, thrice happy is that person that can die well. Now such strokes as these put <hi>a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious soul in mind of dying.</hi> There's none present knows who may go to the <hi>grave next.</hi> That's the First; but then,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It Springs from that <hi>Sympathy</hi> that is both in nature, and grace: first in nature, when God takes away a husband, a Father, a Child, &amp;c. this cuts deep, and affects much. <hi>Abraham</hi> he mourns over beloved <hi>Sarah; David</hi> over <hi>Absolon,</hi> though a rebellious son. To be stupid, and not to mind the hand of God when he smites our near and dear relations, doth declare, that we do not onely want grace, but natural affection; And then in <hi>Grace</hi> there is also a great <hi>sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy:</hi> if God smites one member of the Church, the rest are affected with it: If a <hi>Paul,</hi> a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of Christ, a pastor, a spiritual Father, comes to take his <hi>farewell</hi> of his people, and tell them that <hi>they shall never see his face more; Oh what weeping,</hi> and mourning, <hi>and lamenting is there at his departure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:52526:23"/>
3. The perishing of good men is a <hi>just cause of weeping,</hi> and that because they are a great blessing to the <hi>nations, cities, families, &amp;c.</hi> where they are cast. It fares either the better, or the worse with such places for their sake. When God destroyed the old world, the family of <hi>Noah</hi> was saved for <hi>Noahs</hi> sake, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>Profane wretches are ready to wish the people of God all out of the world; but alas! what would then these wretches do? they are beholding to the saints <hi>for their very beings,</hi> and for the continuance of all their mercies.</p>
                  <p>When God hath but once gathered in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and done his work in <hi>Zion,</hi> he will soon pull the world about these mens ears: If the righteous be taken away, <hi>he is taken away from the evill to come, (Isa</hi> 57. 1.) Wo to <hi>Sodom,</hi> if <hi>Lot</hi> depart; and so I may say, Wo to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> if the righteous should be taken away; Wo to <hi>Graffham</hi> whenever thou ceasest to be a refuge to the saints, whenever thy gates shall be shut against the ministers and people of the Lord Jesus.</p>
                  <p>The Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> though they slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and despised the Prophets, would in time of distress come to them for Prayer, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 8, 9. and 12, 19. Yea, <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> as proud, and as high as he was, yet when the Plague was upon him, <hi>Moses</hi> he must be sent for, and be entreated to pray for him, and his people.</p>
                  <p>And thus much for the Reasons of the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, shewing why the <hi>People of God</hi> must needs be affected with, and <hi>Weep</hi> over the Death of Religious Persons.</p>
                  <p>We shall now proceed to Application.</p>
                  <p>And first it affords matter of information; as First, if it be a Christ-like Frame to <hi>Weep</hi>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:52526:23"/>
over the Death of such as are truly pious, it informs us, how <hi>unlike to Christ</hi> such are, who though they plead for <hi>Christian Burial, yet do attend Funeral Solemnities</hi> with a vain, wicked, ungodly Spirit, and Carriage, making the house of <hi>Weeping a House of Laughter,</hi> and filling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with Wine (wherein is excess) until they become more like beasts than men, which is a practice too common at <hi>Funerals.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You may soon judge how fit such persons are to attend upon a <hi>Funeral Sermon;</hi> but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I am apt to think, <hi>Funeral Sermons</hi> have generally been rather for <hi>Ostentation,</hi> and <hi>Vain Glory,</hi> than for Profit.</p>
                  <p>Hereby is likewise condemned that heathenish practice of <hi>Ringing of Bells,</hi> so soon as ever <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Solemnities</hi> are performed.</p>
                  <p>How unsuitable is it, that so soon as ever the Husband, or Wife, or a godly Friend is laid in the Earth, to set the <hi>Bells a Ringing,</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports matter of joy rather than of sorrow?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If it be a <hi>Christ-like-Frame</hi> of <hi>Spirit,</hi> to <hi>weep</hi> over the Deaths of good men,. it informs us how unlike to Christ that <hi>Spirit</hi> is, whereby men do censure, and reproach good men when taken away by Death.</p>
                  <p>And I do the rather mention this, because some have taken the boldness to judge and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure this <hi>Eminent Servant of Christ now in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and to speak very unworthily concerning him, since his Death.</p>
                  <p>How <hi>unlike to Christ</hi> is this <hi>Spirit?</hi> Thou that shouldst be <hi>judging and condemning thy self</hi> for Non-improvement of so great a mercy, art judging this Eminent servant of Christ now dead. <hi>The Liturgy of the Church of</hi> England <hi>will teach thee better;</hi> for let persons be never so vile
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52526:24"/>
in their lives, yet when they come to be laid in the Grave, then they are dear <hi>Brethren</hi> and <hi>Sisters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore away with this <hi>Spirit,</hi> to Hell with it; for from thence it came. Let it suffice, That this <hi>glorified Saint</hi> suffered much in this kind while he was living: I am apt to think the Heats and Passions, and rash Censures of Professors, hath made him oft go home with a sad Heart, and cost him many <hi>a Tear in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate: Suffer him to be quiet in his Grave;</hi> let this his suffering suffice, let not his name suffer now he is dead; <hi>suffer him to be quiet in his Grave;</hi> leave his judgment to the Lord, and let it be your Work to improve those many <hi>Sermons</hi> that he hath in the fear of his God preach'd unto you.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Who made thee Lord over thy Brothers Conscience?</hi> Must all professors be condemned by thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they cannot see with thy eyes, and tread in thy steps? By what authority doest thou im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose thy particular light and perswasion upon thy brother; &amp; that so, as almost to un-saint him? This imposing spirit is an Antichristian spirit evermore.</p>
                  <p>The next use may be of Exhortation. Is it so, that it is a Christ-like Frame of <hi>Spirit</hi> to be deeply affected with, and to <hi>weep over the death of such as are truly pious?</hi> Then it concerns us seriously to consider the Providences of God this way, and that more <hi>generally and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly.</hi> First, more generally, <hi>God</hi> hath late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made sad breaches upon many of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of his precious Servants; many <hi>a flourishing Family hath mouldred away in a little time:</hi> And <hi>God</hi> hath lately taken away many very famous Instruments, both Ministers and others; so that we have cause to cry out with the Psalmist,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52526:24"/>
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 12 1. <hi>Help Lord, for the Godly Man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the Children of Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> and more particularly, I would beg you of this Congregation to consider the present stroke of God upon you, in taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way your worthy Pastor; his Death justly calls <hi>for weeping and Tears;</hi> if you consider,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That he was one that had <hi>love for all Saints:</hi> he had room in his heart for every soul that he did judge to be received into the heart of Christ: he <hi>held communion with the Saints,</hi> not upon the account of <hi>this or that form, or name,</hi> but upon the account of union with the Lord Jesus: he loved no man upon the <hi>account of opinion,</hi> but upon the account of union with Christ, and this he hath declared many a time in this Congregation. There was <hi>hardly a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> that he did in the name of Christ and the Church give the right hand of fellowship unto, but he did acquaint them with this his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; told them that <hi>Union with Christ was the ground of Communion among the Saints;</hi> and the reason of their admission was not their being of this or that opinion, but for that they were judged persons interested in Christ, and such who (by virtue of Christs purchase) were heirs of that glory above that must receive all Saints <hi>(not as Church of England men, Presbyterians, Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, or Anabaptists,</hi> &amp;c. but as Saints, into its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting habitations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> His Death justly calls for your <hi>Weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Tears,</hi> for that you have lost a <hi>Pastor,</hi> who <hi>had great light in the Covenant of Grace,</hi> he preacht that Doctrine with the greatest alacrity, and raisedness of spirit imaginable. In the handling of other subjects he was more <hi>streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:52526:25"/>
                     <hi>and discomposed;</hi> but when he came to speak of the <hi>unsearchable riches</hi> of the Grace of Christ, he was as an <hi>Angel of God, lifted up above him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:</hi> he had a flood of words, and yet seemed to want words to express what he did know, and what he did enjoy of <hi>divine grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</hi> This being true must needs be great.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To lose a pure Gospel Preacher is a great loss: Eternity depends upon a right understanding of the great Doctrine of Justification by Christ.</hi> Eternity depends not upon being baptized once or twice, upon this or the other Form; we may be <hi>guilty of mistakes about the circumstances of worship, and yet be happy;</hi> but if we mistake about the great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our Justification by Christ, we are lost for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> His Death justly calls for <hi>Weeping,</hi> for as much as we have all lost the Conversation of one who was <hi>an Experimental Christian,</hi> one that had much communion with God, and much expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of his goodness, as you have heard him often express: <hi>Many a Preacher dishes out largely to others, of that which he tastes but little himself.</hi> I am apt to think, many a faithful Minister of Christ lives but low, in comparison to what this blessed Saint enjoyed. By this his Experience, he was enabled to speak a word in due season to the weary Soul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He walked close with God in his Family;</hi> he was not a Saint abroad, and a Devil at home; but made it appear that he was really good, by this, that he was <hi>relatively good,</hi> good in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; a good Husband, a good Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He sate loose from this World;</hi> he made not gain his godliness; he did not design to make Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize of Christ and the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>His discourse was <hi>mostly heavenly, and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al:</hi>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:52526:25"/>
If other discourse was in hand, he was but dull Company, he had little to say: but if the <hi>Conference were Heavenly,</hi> he was as upon the Wing, as a fish in the Water, and a Bird in the Air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He would often say, with pious <hi>Dod, come, enough of the World, now let us talk of Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it be here objected, that he was in his younger years of a vain and slight conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I answer,</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Divine Love rideth in greatest triumph, when it hath the greatest sinners following it as it's Captives.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Some in the Church of</hi> Corinth <hi>that did heartily close with Christ, were before their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version very Vile and Wicked,</hi> see 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10, 11. Such were some of you, but ye are wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>&amp;c. But,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>This blessed Saint would to his dying day, acknowledge his former vanity, to his own shame, and the lifting up of the Riches of free grace; and mind what the Apostle saith,</hi> 1 John 1. 9. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give our sins, and to cleanse us from all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness.</p>
                  <p>I shall now close up all with a word or two by way of <hi>Caution;</hi> and that</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Though this stroke of God <hi>be just matter of weeping and sorrow,</hi> yet you must take heed of a <hi>murmuring Spirit:</hi> You have cause to be displeased with your selves, and your sins, but not with God, <hi>because God takes away nothing but what he first gave.</hi> The Person and gifts of this Saint, were given unto you by the Lord; he hath taken nothing but his own. Learn there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to say with <hi>Job</hi> Chap. 1. 21. <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:52526:26"/>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Though you are to weep under this stroke, yet take heed of <hi>mourning as those with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope;</hi> without hope, I say, 1. With respect to him; his happiness is unquestionable: Your loss is his gain. He is taken up into glory, and hath there communion with God. He is now <hi>where God is served, adored and glorified with one heart, and with one consent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, Weep not without Hope</hi> with respect to your selves, as if God were not able to make up this loss. <hi>I remember a Relation of a Lady, from whom it pleased God to take an only Son, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time after a Friend coming to visit her, and bemoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this her sad loss, she breaks forth into these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,</hi> [I profess <hi>(saith she)</hi> God can never make me amends for the taking away of that Son] A dreadful speech it was; take heed (my friends) of this Spirit. It's true, your loss is great, but God is able to supply it; and that either,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First, By causing the Spirit of</hi> Elijah <hi>to fall upon</hi> Elisha, by anointing and raising up of some other to head and feed you in the room of this his Servant. Or <hi>2dly.</hi> He can <hi>feed you himself with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Minister:</hi> God can fill up the room of Ministry and Ordinances. Indeed let God be absent, and there's nothing can fill up his Room: It's not <hi>Husband, Wife, Children, Estate, Liberty, Pastors, Ordinances, &amp;c.</hi> can supply the want of God: But now let God be present, and that is above, and more than all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly, Such strokes should teach us all to provide for death.</hi> God takes away our Leaders, and we must follow them: Those that would not follow the Counsel and advice of this pious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, <hi>while living, must follow him to the Grave now dead;</hi> to the Grave we must all go, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52526:26"/>
the Lord knows how soon: Of what import therefore is it, that we all manage matters so <hi>while we live,</hi> as that when we come to die we may die in peace, and in full assurance of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life? Our present Time, is but a dressing Room for Eternity;</hi> let us therefore perform every thing with this Proviso, <hi>That I may die well.</hi> I am so to buy, sell, and converse with Creatures, <hi>that I may die well.</hi> I am so to hear, pray, read, receive the Sacrament, <hi>have Communion with the Saints,</hi> as <hi>that</hi> I <hi>may die well,</hi> die in peace; all is to be done in order to dying well.
<q>
                        <l>Such, Death may wound, but never can destroy,</l>
                        <l>Their <hi>House of weeping</hi> proves an <hi>House of joy.</hi>
                        </l>
                     </q>
                  </p>

                  <head>Death parts the dearest Friends.</head>
                  <p>WHen a man goes to his <hi>Long Home,</hi> all the <hi>pleasure in his Society</hi> is dead with him; nothing remains of it, but the remembrance, which serves only to aggravate, and heighten the Grief of the Surviver. 'Twas a true saying of one—<hi>Aura secunda bonus socius:</hi> A good companion is as a prosperous Gale, carrying a Man pleasantly, and with comfort, through the Tempestuous Sea of this World. And again—<hi>Bonum sodalitium op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timum solatium. Good Company is the best solace:</hi> Indeed, suitable <hi>Society</hi> is the comfort of Life, the improvement of Parts, the joy of the Intellect, the only distinguishing Priviledge that gives the Preference to Men above Beasts. Take away this, and what happiness is it to be a Man, or what is humane Life any thing to be accounted of. But when Man is dead, there can be no more delight in him, or comfort received by <hi>Society</hi> with him. There is no converse in the shades below, no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlocution in those gloomy Regions. <hi>The Grave is a silent Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>se,</hi> where the Eyes of all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants are closed in the Dust, and their Mouths filled with cold Clay. And therefore this should cause <hi>Mourning in the Streets,</hi> when we see a man going to his <hi>Long Home,</hi> especially if he was a Friend or Relation, because we shall never have the opportunity of enjoying any pleasant hours with him more. We must then bid farewel to all discoursing upon any Subject, to all advising a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52526:27"/>
any difficulties, to all profiting by any Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick Notions started and improved in an amica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way. In a word, we must bid <hi>an eternal Adieu</hi> to any pleasure or satisfaction we received in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muning with him, for we shall enjoy no more of it for ever. Oh! surely this cannot but cut deep in a generous Soul; this cannot but greatly wound a spirit, whose thoughts are drained from the dross of <hi>Plebeian</hi> Conversation, that has any esteem at all for the advantages of a rational Life. Upon this account it was, that the old Prophet in <hi>Bethel,</hi> lamented over the man of God which came from <hi>Judab,</hi> who was slain by a Lion, as he rode upon an Ass in the High-way. He bitterly bewailed, and mourned for his Death, crying out,—<hi>Alas my Brother!</hi> As if he had said, I have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly refreshed by thy company, in hearing the Word of the Lord from thy mouth, concerning the destruction of the Priests that burn Incense upon the Altar, and the pulling down the House of <hi>Jeroboam.</hi> Oh! <hi>How have I been strengthned in my Courage, confirmed in my Faith, and the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved in the Ways of God, by this thy Prophecy. But now thou art gone, I shall never have any more of this profitable and spiritual Discourse with thee.</hi> This made him weep over his torn Carcass, and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lament his untimely Fall, and to give a solemn Charge to his Sons, that when he was dead, they should bury him in the Sepulchre wherein this man of God was buryed, and lay his Bones close by the Bones of this Prophet.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Death</hi> parts us from a Friend, we shall never see him more: he vanishes (as it were) out of our sight, and we are never more to behold him, or cast our Eyes upon him. He is both actively and passively in an invisible State. So <hi>Job</hi> mournfully speaks of himself, <hi>chap.</hi> 7. <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8. <hi>Oh! remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:52526:28"/>
                     <hi>that my life is wind, my eyes shall no more see good. The Eye of him that hath seen me, shall see me no more; thy Eyes are upon me, and I am not.</hi> What more cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Expression, what more sadning Inculcation, what more provoking Incitation to <hi>Mourning,</hi> can there be, than the Sense of this; that we shall behold the Face of our beloved Friend (after his departure from us) no more! Were Man to Return, though after never so many Years absence from his home, or continuance in the <hi>Grave:</hi> Were he to visit his habitation again, and become the objective delight of his poor <hi>Mourning</hi> Friends and Relations, it might be some alleviation to their Grief, when he takes his journey to his <hi>Long home.</hi> But Oh! <hi>What a prick to the heart,</hi> what a stab to the Soul, what a deadning to the Spirits, what an inundation of Sorrow (like the opening of <hi>Pandora</hi>'s Box) is this lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Thought to an ingenuous Man, that he must never, never, never more behold the Face of this or that Relation in this Region of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality; nor have any converse with him on this side the <hi>Bank of Eternity! What Husband can think so of his Wife, and not melt?</hi> what Wife can have such a thought of her Husband, and not faint? what Parent can consider this, with respect to his Child, and not mourn? what Child can reflect upon the impossibility of ever seeing his Father or Mother more, and not be overwhelmed with grief? In a word, What Friend or Relation can ponder on such an <hi>eternal Farewel, as is then given, and not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved into Tears.</hi> It is the opinion of Divines, That the chiefest of Saints happiness, consists in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or in the use of the visive faculty, which will then be enlarged and made glorious to perfection; for they shall see the Face of God
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52526:28"/>
in Righteousness, and be satisfied with his likeness; they shall be for ever with open Face, beholding (as in a Glass) the Glory of the Lord, and be changed into the same Image, from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. Sure I am, the Saints greatest comfort in this World, consists in Vision, or beholding God's Image in his People; and that not only the work of his Power in their comly Features, but the work of his Grace in the divine Characters of Wisdom, engraven in their Souls and immediatly reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon in all their Actions. Therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but cause Mourning, when such delightful Objects are removed out of sight, and never more to be beheld.</p>
                  <p>And so much the more still, if consider the great change and alteration Death makes in the place of the Deceased; the great Vacuum there is, when Man is removed, and carried away to his <hi>Long home:</hi> Concerning which, <hi>Job</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently speaks, <hi>chap.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10, 11. <hi>As the cloud is consumed, and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the</hi> Grave, <hi>shall come up no more. He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more. Therefore I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain my Mouth, I Will speak in the anguish of my Spirit I will complain in the bitterness of my Soul.</hi> Oh! It is very sad to consider what a great change one stroke of Death may make. A Wife Husbandless, poor Children Fatherless, Servants Masterless, and many Friends Comfortless: And so great is the alteration in the Family, that the whole House resents it; and seems si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently to <hi>Mourn</hi> for it. There is (as it were) a Face of sadness in every place he was wont to be conversant in: <hi>Look in his Parlour,</hi> where he used to sit with his Wife, and Children
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52526:29"/>
about him, and there is nothing but a profound silence; his voice is not to be heard: <hi>Look at his Table,</hi> where he used to sit with chearfulness, eating his Bread with joy among his Relations, and the dull demeanor, and sorrowful posture of all the assessors, do plainly, yet dolefully speak, Behold, he is not here: <hi>Look in his Shop,</hi> where he used to be about his occasions; and the disorder and confusion there proclaims aloud his being gone, and not to be heard of: In a word, <hi>Look in every place</hi> where he us'd to be, and you will find one mourning circumstance or other, a legible Historian of his departure, and being no more among them. So that, if you seek him, you will not find him; if you ask for him, you will hear no news. Now sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, methinks, the very miss of a Man in his Family, the want of him in his place, the great change immediately following his Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in his Relations and in all his affairs and Concerns, should be cause enough to enforce a <hi>Mourning</hi> from his Survivors, if there were no other consideration, and cause 'em to prepare for their own Deaths. For,</p>
                  <p>How many have we known that were of as healthful and vigorous a Constitution as we are, that by a Surfeit, or an acute Feaver, have in a few days been snatch'd away? How many that were travelling on the same Road with us a while ago, are now at their long Home, lying in the Grave; and should not we by their early depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>learn to die?</hi> It would not be tedious to us in this sense, to live in <hi>Golgotha,</hi> or to <hi>dwell among the Tombs,</hi> when we have in them seen <hi>the End of all Men,</hi> Eccles. 7. 2. We should not any more love the World, nor its Enjoyments and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, seeing they will vanish in the twinkling of an
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52526:29"/>
Eye; and after all the poor satisfaction they have given us, fall into the dead Sea. The Passing-Bells of others loudly tell us, that <hi>Man in his best Estate is altogether Vanity,</hi> Psal. 39. 5. And what they have undergone, will in a few days or hours more, be our own Lot. Though they are gone before, we must tread in their steps, and go the same way. When that hour is come, all our Friends and Acquaintance cannot hold us; for we that now hear, and move, and speak, shall fly away into a vast Expanse, and not <hi>behold Man with the Inhabitants of this World any more,</hi> Isa. 38. 11. As we have seen the pale Looks, and have heard the last Voice of others, so shall we our selves in the like manner be made Spectacles of Mortality to those that remain after us. We, and all our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, must take along Farewel of each other, and not meet again till the day of the general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection. And is it too soon to remember our Creator, when we have seen many as Young as we are, breathe their last? And we that now mourn for others, know not how soon our Friends may do the same for us, and celebrate our Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals. When God took away many others, that we knew he might at the same time, or before, have taken away you or me; and why do we survive their Death, but that we may set <hi>our House in Order?</hi> The time is coming, when Riches and Honour, Health and Beauty, Credit and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation among men, will be of no value, nor will Gold and Silver, the Idols of this, be currant in the next World. We should not therefore be like those young people that are only serious in the House of <hi>Mourning,</hi> or when they see their Friends carried to the Grave, but in the next vain Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny suffer the Impressions of their <hi>Mortality</hi> to wear off again. We must be always sober in our
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52526:30"/>
Conversation, as not knowing when we our selves shall be gone; only this we may know, that as the Years we have already lived are soon past, so will those that are to come with the same swist motion pass away. The long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Life here on Earth is but as a moment, if compar'd with the future Eternity: 'Tis as a flash of Lightning to the whole Element of Fire, just seen, and then vanish'd.</p>

                     <hi>MY dearest Children,</hi> ye whom <hi>I love</hi> in the tender and yerning <hi>Bowels</hi> of <hi>Affection; draw near,</hi> and <hi>attend</hi> to the words of your <hi>dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mother,</hi> who am now <hi>sighing out my last breath:</hi> A <hi>weak</hi> Woman <hi>ye see</hi> I am; but yet <hi>sinful</hi> I am, which peradventure <hi>ye see not.</hi> O <hi>weep</hi> not, my <hi>pretty ones:</hi> do not <hi>pierce</hi> and <hi>break</hi> my troubled <hi>heart</hi> with your <hi>sad laments.

                     <hi>day, ye have been rebellious against the Lord; and how much more after my death?</hi> Deut. 31. 27. <hi>I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt your selves, and turn aside from the way which I commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days, because ye will do evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands,</hi> vers. 29. <hi>But I am persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though I thus speak,</hi> Heb. 6. 9. O my <hi>dear ones,</hi> hearken unto the words which I shall say: They must be my <hi>Legacy</hi> unto you: <hi>Hear</hi> me with <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience;</hi> and treasure up in your memories the <hi>last Speech</hi> of your <hi>Fainting,</hi> your <hi>dying Mother.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How <hi>dear</hi> ye cost me <hi>before</hi> ye had life, and what <hi>Pangs</hi> and <hi>Torments</hi> I suffered for you <hi>before</hi> ye were <hi>heard</hi> or <hi>seen</hi> in the <hi>World, ye</hi> cannot <hi>imagine,</hi> nor I <hi>express.</hi> Yet all was <hi>forgotten for joy that ye w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>re born,</hi> Joh. 16. 21. and hoping that ye would add unto the <hi>Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ire of Saints.</hi> To this purpose, I have laboured and taken care for the nourishment both of your Souls and Bodies; and for your sustentation (so much as in me lay) from the Breast to this instant. O what sad and perplexed thoughts have I had for you in the day times; and how many hours have I borrowed from my sleep in the nights, to think what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of you, if ye should not be obedient to the Commandments of my God! To the same God they are best known. O how often upon my knees have I prayed for your happiness; and wept, and mourned, when ye have done what ye ought not! To him is it best known to whom I now am going. Sometimes when ye have offended, I was enforced to correct you: but each stripe which ye received did cut me into the heart. In many things ye failed, because ye were young: and in many
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52526:31"/>
things I failed too, because I am a weak and a sinful Woman. If at any time ye thought that I did not my Duty, take heed that hereafter ye remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it not to my dishonour. Ponder in your minds that curse which wretched <hi>Ham</hi> the Father of <hi>Canaan</hi> received from <hi>Noah,</hi> when he saw his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness, and told his Brethren. <hi>Cursed</hi> (said <hi>Noah) be</hi> Canaan: <hi>a servant of servants shall he be to his Brethren,</hi> Gen. 9. 25. But because <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japhet, took a Garment, and laid it upon their Shoulders, and went backward, and covered the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness of their Father, and their faces were back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and they saw not their Fathers nakedness,</hi> vers. 23. Therefore he said, <hi>Blessed be the Lord God of</hi> Shem, <hi>and</hi> Canaan <hi>shall be his servant,</hi> vers. 26. <hi>God shall enlarge</hi> Japhet, <hi>and he shall dwell in the Tents of</hi> Shem, <hi>and</hi> Canaan <hi>shall be his Servant,</hi> v. 27. Consider with your selves that I am your mother. Whatsoever imperfections ye have discovered in me, do in some kind reflect even upon your selves: for as your Bodies were mine, so my Credit and good Name you must account to be yours. But I cannot think that ye will need more Advice for this, which even Nature it self should teach you to practise.</p>
                  <p>My time is but short; my Speech beginneth to fail me. I will not trouble you with much, although something more I must say unto you, which I hope ye will remember when I shall sleep in the Dust. Your first and chiefest Duty must always be for the service of your God. If ye will daily observe the benefits which he sendeth you, ye cannot chuse but thank him daily for his Blessings. Let it be your care to ground your actions upon his written Law. Undertake nothing which is not warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Word: and go forward in nothing by unlawful means, or to a bad intent. Begin all in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52526:31"/>
him, and continue in him, and end in him; and he himself will be your Reward. If ye always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve Religion in your hearts, ye will always have quietness and content in your minds. First make him your God, and then distrust not his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; no, nor his love and compassion while ye remain his Children. In whatsoever vocations ye shall lead your lives, be sure that ye be <hi>conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably industrious</hi> and laborious in them; and then leave the event and the blessing to his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. I would fain have you be his Children much more than ye are mine: for ye have nothing from me but your sin and corruption; but from him you must expect both grace and glory. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye strive to bless and magnifie your God, ye may be sure that <hi>your God</hi> will both bless and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie <hi>you</hi> his <hi>Children.</hi> Remember that <hi>the blessing of the Lord maketh rich; and he addeth no Sorrow with it,</hi> Prov. 10. 22. Take heed therefore to <hi>your</hi> selves, and let him be in all <hi>your thoughts;</hi> for even for them <hi>ye</hi> must account at his great <hi>Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi> Take heed unto <hi>your Words,</hi> that <hi>they</hi> give none offence either to <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Man.</hi> There is a sort of people who <hi>bless with their mouths, but they curse in their inward parts,</hi> Psal. 62. 4. I would not have <hi>you</hi> be of the number of them: for <hi>as they love cursing, so it shall happen unto them: they delight not in blessing, therefore shall it be far from them,</hi> Psal 109. 17. <hi>As they cloath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with cursing like as with a Garment, so it shall come into their Bowels like Water, and like Oyl into their Bones,</hi> vers. 18. Take heed also unto <hi>your Actions,</hi> that there be not wickedness in the intent, nor sin in the prosecution of them: for howsoever <hi>they</hi> shall appear in the <hi>Eye</hi> of the <hi>World, they</hi> will be strictly and justly examined by the righteous judge. First be <hi>ye</hi> sure that <hi>ye</hi>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:52526:32"/>
bless <hi>your</hi> God, and then <hi>ye</hi> may expect a blessing from him. <hi>When ye have eaten and are full, then ye shall bless the Lord your God,</hi> Deut. 8. 10. Remember <hi>the Congregation of</hi> Israel, <hi>how they blessed the Lord God of their Fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshiped the Lord,</hi> 1 Chr. 29. 20. Remember how <hi>the</hi> Levites <hi>encouraged the People unto it, and said unto them, Stand up, and bless the Lord your God for ever and ever, and blessed be thy glorious Name, which is exalted above all blessing, and praise,</hi> Neh. 9. 5. Remember how the <hi>Psalmist</hi> moved them unto it when he cryed, <hi>O bless our God ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard,</hi> Psal. 66. 8. <hi>Be thankful unto him, and bless his Name,</hi> Psalm 100. 4. Remember how <hi>David</hi> resolved, saying, <hi>I will bless the Lord, which hath given me coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,</hi> Psal. 16. 7. Remember how he decreed, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I will bless thee while I live, I will lift up my hands in thy Name,</hi> Psal. 63. 4. Remember how he encouraged his Soul to this Duty, saying, <hi>Bless the Lord O my Soul, and all that is within me bless his holy Name,</hi> Psal. 103. 1. <hi>Bless the Lord O my Soul, and forget not all his benefits,</hi> vers. 2. <hi>Who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who healeth all thy disease,</hi> vers. 3. Remember how he practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it when <hi>he blessed the Lord before all the Congregation, and said, Blessed be thou Lord God of</hi> Israel, <hi>our Father for ever and ever,</hi> 1 Chr. 29. 10. <hi>Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the Power, and the Glory, and the Victory, and the Majesty; for all that is in the Heaven, and in the Earth is thine: Thine is the Kingdom, O Lord, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:52526:32"/>
                     <hi>thee, and praise thy glorious Name,</hi> vers. 13. And remember how <hi>Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God; and all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with listing up their hands; and they bowed their heads, and worshiped the Lord, with their Faces to the ground,</hi> Neh. 8. 6. Thus if <hi>ye</hi> bless him, if <hi>ye</hi> love him, if <hi>ye</hi> honour him, if <hi>ye</hi> obey him, he will so bless <hi>you,</hi> that <hi>ye</hi> shall delight in his Service, and be filled with his Goodness. Carry in <hi>your</hi> minds those words of the <hi>Psalmist, Blessed is every one that feareth the Lord, that walketh in his ways: For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee,</hi> Psal. 128. 1, 2. <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed is the Man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is,</hi> Jer. 17. 7. Remember how <hi>after the Death of</hi> Abraham, <hi>God blessed his Son</hi> Isaac, Gen. 25. 11. So he may <hi>you,</hi> and so he will <hi>you,</hi> when I, your poor feeble Mother, am stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth, and returned to the Earth; if <hi>ye</hi> will <hi>hear his voice, and observe his statutes.</hi> If so <hi>you</hi> will do, then <hi>the Lord your God will bless you in all the works of your hands, which ye shall do,</hi> Deut. 14. 29. He who <hi>created man in his own Image both Male and Female, and blessed them,</hi> Gen. 1. 27, 28. Even the same Lord will <hi>bless you,</hi> if ye be <hi>Righteous,</hi> Psal. 5. 12. <hi>And with favour he will compass you as with a Shield,</hi> Psalm 115. 13. <hi>He will bless them that fear him, both small and great,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 6.</p>
                  <p>And now my Children, I have not much more to say to you; for <hi>the time of my departure is at hand.</hi> If you do heartily love your God I know that ye will affectionately love each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Ye will be observant to your Guardians, and Instructors: Ye will be courteous unto all.

                  <p>All that I can do now, is to pray for you; and my weakness will hardly permit me to do that: Yet so long as I can speak I trust I shall pray, and in my petitions remember both my self and you.

Art thou deeply convinced, Oh Man, what a glittering and a glorious Divine Ray, doth quicken, actuate, and ennoble that Lump of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, which thy Body is composed of? And when that Body of thine shall be crumbled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Ashes, by one touch of the Almighty, hast thou forethought what shall become of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal In-mate, which for a little season hath been cloystered up in thy clay Breast? And dost thou soundly believe, that there is a future state of Infinite joy, and eternal Sorrow? And hast thou throughly pondered the certain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of all temporal Enjoyments? And art thou heartily perswaded, that Heaven is only worth the looking after? What sayest thou to these things, Oh my Soul? Let the matter be urged home, is everlasting damnation by all means possible, to be prevented? Or may Hell be supposed to be a tolerable Habitation? Or can a poor guilty Worm endure with ease, the burden of infinite Wrath? Or is endless glory no whit desirable? Or will it not repent thee, Oh my Soul, hereafter, when it is too late, if thou now neglect so great Salvation, as is free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offered to thee in Christ Jesus? Dost thou know, Oh Man, that thou must shortly give up the Ghost? And yet hast thou not had one se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious deep thought, what place of entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thy naked Soul shall find in another world, when it is stript of its present fleshly case and cloathing? Oh press thy Soul hard with these thoughts, how it is like to go with thee, when thou first steppest into Eternity? What sayest thou. Oh my Soul, are the things of time only or chiefly to be minded? And are the precious things of Eternity utterly to be forgotten, or
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52526:35"/>
disregarded? Hath the infinitely wise and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God, only given thee opportunities and abilities to desire, and hasten thy eternal ruin? And hast thou no time, capacity, understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or will, to work out thy Salvation, with fear and trembling? Canst thou once suppose, thou shalt ever be an Inhabitant upon the Earth? Or is the Earth, with the sensual delights there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which thou must certainly forego, more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable than Heaven, with its fulness of joy, and pleasures for evermore? Or if thy judgment be clear in this case, why doest thou no more think upon, love, and long to be dissolved, and to be cloathed upon with that house, which comes down from Heaven? Will the enjoying of sinful pleasures, or empty lying vanities, for a few minutes, recompence the loss of Heaven it self? Can any thing be counted an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, when the Soul loseth God, and it self, in the getting of it? Or can any thing be had upon Earth, that will hold ever? Awake, Oh my drowsie Soul, and let thy Conscience and Conversation, no longer contradict one the other. If thou judgest Heaven to be Heaven indeed, and one moments Communion with God, more worth than ten thousand Worlds; then let thy Conversation be new in Heaven, that thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science may not hereafter witness against thee. Or tell me plainly, Oh my Soul, Dost thou pretend that thou art really willing to go to Heaven, and yet art unwilling for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, through thy weakness of Faith, to leave this Earth, with all the sensible comforts of it? Or doth thy natural timorousness, or unpreparedness, put a check to the vehemency of thy Desires? Or, what is it, that thou so much stickest at? Is there a Lion in the way? Wouldst thou not be detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52526:36"/>
one day, one minute, or moment longer from drinking thy fill at the Fountain of Living Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and yet art afraid to pass over that narrow darksome Bridge of Death which leadeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto? Indeed, Death is the King of Fears; but yet a Serpent without a Sting, may safely be put into thy Bosom. Thou art then willing to be with thy glorious Redeemer upon the Throne, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the sad Thoughts of giving up thy tender Flesh to be meat for the Worms, that something startles thee. But weigh the matter well; canst thou be for ever happy, and not be with Christ? Or canst thou be whereChrist is, and not die? Well then, welcom death, tho' not for thine own sake, yet for his sake whose Messenger thou art, and who hath sent thee to fetch me home to himself; with whom I shall be, as soon as ever I am but parted from thee. Then I shall with joy look back upon thee, O sad Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger, and triumph over thee, saying, <hi>Oh Death, where is thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <hi>Dearly Beloved,</hi> In my Discourse upon these words, I will not be over tedious, but with as much brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as I can I will unfold some of the weighty Truths contained therein. And the Lord grant that they may be of general use to all persons that shall either read or hear them.</p>
                  <p>These words have Relation unto the precedent Verses in this Chapter, wherein our Saviour Christ, from the thirteenth to the seventeenth verse, reproveth the Covetousness of the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees,</hi> by shewing unto them, that no man can serve two Masters, that is, God and Riches. <hi>All these things heard the Pharisees, which were covetous, and they mocked him:</hi> Whereupon he aptly and fitly taketh occasion to relate this Parable of the Rich Man and <hi>Lazarus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hearken therefore now, and I will speak of a great Rich Man, that flourished here on Earth (as a learned Divine observes,) <hi>In all pomp and abundance, that shined in courtly purple Robes, that was cloathed in</hi> Byssus <hi>and fine Silk, and fared deliciously, that was lodged softly, that lived plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly. But understand what became of this Rich Man; his years being expired, and his days numb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and his time determined, he was invited to the fatal Banquet of black ugly Death, that mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all men subject to the rigour of his Law; his Body was honourably buried, in respect of his much Wealth: but what became of his Soul? That was carried from his Body to dwell with the Devils; from his purple Robes to burning Flames, from his soft Silk and white</hi> Byssus <hi>to cruel pains in black</hi> Abyssus, <hi>from his Palace here on Earth, to the Palace of Devils in Hell; from Paradise to a Dungeon, from Pleasures to Pains, from Joy to Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:52526:37"/>
                     <hi>and that by hellish means, damned Spirits, into the infernal Laks of bottomless</hi> Barathrum, <hi>where is wo, wo, wo! And where is weeping and wailing, and gnashing of Teeth,</hi> Mat. 25. <hi>The wicked shall be turned into Hell, and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that forget God,</hi> Psalm 6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hearken also of a certain poor Beggar clothed in rags, with miseries pained, pained with griefs, grieved with sores, sorely tormented, unmercifully condemned, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at this Rich Mans Gate, desiring to be refreshed but with the Crumbs that fell from the rich Man's table, the dogs had more pity than this rich man, on this distressed creature, for they came to visit him, they came to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him, they came and licked his sores.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Well, his time being also determined, he went the way of all flesh, and death was the finisher of all his mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and griefs;</hi> Vita assumpsit mortem, ut mors vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam acciperet; He died once, to live for ever. <hi>And what became of his soul? it was carried from his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to his Master, from a House of Clay, to a house not made with hands, from a wilderness to a Paradise, from an earthly prison, to a heavenly Palace, from the richmans gate, to the City of the great God, from pains to pleasures, from miseries to joys, from</hi> Adams <hi>corruption,</hi> to Abrahams <hi>bosom. It was carried by Angels into the Quires of Angels, to have his being and moving in the very mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heavens with God himself. Where is life, food and abundance, and glory, and Health and peace, and eternity, and all good things: all above all that either can be wished or desired: And this is the subject that I shall now speak of.</hi> And here let it please you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the argument of this Scripture, which is twofold:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Our Saviour Christ hereby adviseth all <hi>rich men</hi> to be merciful to their poor Brethren in this Life, lest they find no <hi>mercy</hi> in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:52526:38"/>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> He doth comfort all <hi>poor men,</hi> that although they are afflicted in this life with great miseries and calamities, yet they shall be comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the life to come, and rest in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s bosom.</p>
                  <p>And here observe what one <hi>formerly Notes,</hi> viz. That if Jesus Christ had said only thus much, <hi>There was a certain Rich man that fared sumptuously daily, and a certain Beggar laid at his Gate full of sores:</hi> The wicked would have straightway inferr'd that the rich man was the happy man, for at the first view it seems to be so; But take all together and you'l quickly see that there is no man in a worse condition than this miserable wretch.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) That if a man would judge of persons according to outward appearance, he shall very often take his mark amiss. Here is a man to outward appearance, appears the only blessed man; better by half than the Beggar, in as much as he is rich, the Beggar poor: he is well clothed, but peradventure the Beggar is naked; he hath good food, but the Beggar would be glad of Dogs meat <hi>(and he desired to be fed with the Crumbs of the Rich Man's Table,)</hi> the Rich man fares well every day, but the Beggar must be glad of a bit when and where he can get it. O! who would not be in the Rich man's state? A wealthy man, sorts of new Suits, dainty Dishes every day: enough to make one, who minds nothing but his belly and his back, and his lusts, to say, O that I were in that mans condition! Oh that I had about me, as that man hath! then I should live a life indeed; then should I have hearts ease good store; then should I live pleasantly, and might say to my Soul, <hi>Soul, be of good chear, eat, drink, and be merry,</hi> Luke 12. 19. <hi>thou hast every thing plenty,</hi>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:52526:38"/>
                     <hi>and art in a most blessed condition.</hi> But if the whole Parable be well considered, you will see <hi>Luke</hi> 26. 15. that that which is had in high estimation with men, is an abomination to God. And again, <hi>John</hi> 16. 20, 21, 22. that condition that is the saddest condition, according to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance is oft-times the most excellent; for the Beggar had ten thousand times the best of it, though to outward appearance his state was the saddest.</p>
                  <p>Methinks, to see how the tearing Gallants of the World will go strutting up and down the Streets: Sometimes it strikes me with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; surely they look upon themselves to be the only happy men, but it is because they judge according to outward appearance; they look upon themselves to be the only blessed men, when the Lord knows the generality are left out of that blessed condition; <hi>Not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 26. Ah! did they that do now so brag that no body dare scarce look on them; but believe this, it would make them hang down their heads and cry, Oh! give me a <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s portion.</p>
                  <p>But I'll proceed to the division of my Text and in this Scripture observe these following parts, (formerly taken notice of) <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <div type="subsection">
                     <head>The parts of the Text are four.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. The life of the rich man, in these words, <hi>There was a certain rich man, cloathed in purple and fine linnen, and fared sumptuously every day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The life of the Beggar, in these words: <hi>Also there was a certain Beggar, named</hi> Lazarus, <hi>which was laid at his Gate full of sores,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:52526:39"/>
3. The death of the Beggar, in these words; <hi>And it was so that the Beggar died and was carried,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The death of the rich man; <hi>The rich man also died and was buried.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the first part, I note these three circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. What this Rich Man was, and whether there were any such man or no.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. What his Apparel was; not mean or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, but <hi>Purple and fine Linnen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. That his Diet was not base, nor homely, but delicious, and not once, nor twice, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day.</p>
                     <p>In the Life of the Beggar, I find four Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Where he lived: in no Palace or House, but at the Rich mans Gate.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. How he lived: neither in Health nor Wealth, but miserable, full of Sores.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That he desired in this life, not Lordships, or Houses, or Land, or Gold, or Silver, but Crumbs to save his Life.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Who shewed the Beggar kindness in his Life? Not the Rich man, but the Rich mans Dogs, <hi>The Dogs came also and licked his Sores.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the death of the Beggar, I note these three Circumstances.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>What became of his Body being dead?</hi> No men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereof is made in Holy Scriptures; it may be it was Buried with little or no respect, because he was a poor man, or else cast into some Ditch, by reason of his Sores.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>What became of his Soul?</hi> It went not out to Purgatory (for there is no such place) but it was carried into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Bosom.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By whom? By Angels. <hi>It was carried by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels into</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Bosom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="55" facs="tcp:52526:39"/>
In the Death of the Rich man, I note these two Circumstances.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>What became of his Body being dead?</hi> It was Honourably Buried because of his great Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>What became of his Soul?</hi> It went to Hell. <hi>He being in torments, lift up his Eyes, and saw</hi> Abraham <hi>afar off, and</hi> Lazarus <hi>in his Bosom.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="subsection">
                     <head>Of these successively.</head>
                     <p>And first, in the life of the Rich man, we noted what this Rich Man was, whether there was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed any such man or no: Wherefore here may a Question arise, whether this be a Parable or Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story: The Writers hereof do not agree.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Marlorat</hi> saith, <hi>Quanquam quibusquam haec simplex Parabola esse videtur, tamen quia his Lazari nomen expri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitur, rem gestam narrari probabile;</hi> Some are of that mind, that this is a Parable, yet because (saith he) Christ twice expresseth the name of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> it argueth, that he spake of a thing that was so done indeed.</p>
                     <p>Likewise saith <hi>Franciscus Lambertus, Credendum ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis esse historiam &amp; exemplum verum quàm Parabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam;</hi> It must be believed that this is rather a Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, and a true Example than a Parable.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Theophilactus</hi> is of a contrary opinion, who saith, <hi>Parabola haec est &amp; non vera historia;</hi> This is a Parable and no History.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Erasmus</hi> also saith, that it is but a Parable, whereby Rich Men may learn to be merciful to their poor Brethren, that they may speak for them in the day of Vengeance and Wrath.</p>
                     <p>Many Writers there are also, that rather aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Arguments and Observations herein, have not set down their Judgments, whether it
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52526:40"/>
be a Parable or History: Therefore it might seem Wisdom in me to suspend my judgment also herein, especially, since <hi>Marlorat saith, Parum refert, ut tam sit Parabola, an Historia, modo sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam doctrinam teneant lectores.</hi> It greatly skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not whether it be a Parable or History, so that we duly consider the Doctrine herein.</p>
                     <p>But because it is requisite that I also shew my Opinion, I will return my Verdict, according to my Evidence: And therefore in naked truth I find and hold that it is a Parable: And my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are these two: First, because our Saviour in the beginning of this Chapter, doth relate a Parable of the Rich Man that had a Steward, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore he continueth in this Chapter to open his mouth in Parables, according to the Prophet, <hi>I will open my mouth in Parables, and shew dark sentences of old time.</hi> Secondly, because the Rich Man cryed out of Hell unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> answered the Rich man; which needs must be understood Parabolically: For the Damned in Hell cannot see nor hear the Saints that are in Heaven, neither by reason of the distance of place, and also because of many Sphears and Orbs that are betwixt Heaven and Hell, neither shall they see nor know what is done there. And again, <hi>Abraham</hi>'s throat is dry, and cleaveth to the Roof of his Mouth: Therefore he cannot speak so loud as to be heard out of Heaven into Hell. Therefore it is but a Parable.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, let us consider what his Apparel was, Purple and fine white, as some will have: But we read, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, although some take it for fine Flax, yet let it here be understood of Silk. There was a very great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Apparel of <hi>John</hi> the Baptist, and this
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52526:40"/>
Man; <hi>John</hi>'s Rayment was Camels Hair, with a Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Girdle about his Loins, which did Argue Repentance and Mortification in him; but this Rich Mans Apparel was Purple and fine Silk; whose outward Apparel did argue the Pride at his Heart: The outward Habit for the most part resembles the inward Habit and condition of the Mind. Pride, as saith one, is grounded in the Heart of Man, a Vice most loathsom to God, hateful to Men, and hurtful to the Soul.</p>
                     <p>But let us consider the third Circumstance in the Life of the Rich Man, to wit, what his Dyet was, <hi>Deliciously every day:</hi> And here we see what the Children of this World delight in, namely, <hi>in fulness of Meat, who neglecting the serving of God, have given themselves to serve</hi> Bacchus <hi>and</hi> Venus. Hence one noteth, <hi>A gluttonous Person eateth more for Pleasure than Necessity:</hi> So did the Rich Man, so did our first Parents, it was not through need or necessity, that they did eat of the forbidden Tree, but through Wantonness, Pleasure, and Idleness. <hi>Gluttony is a flattering Devil, and a pleasant sin, and a sweet Poyson, which whoso useth, hath not the use of himself, which who so hath not, hath no sin, for he is all sin it self.</hi> Besides, it hath an especial effect, for it doth, as <hi>Gregory</hi> saith, generate Lust.</p>
                     <p>To be short, it was Gluttony that caused our Parents to transgress. It was Gluttony that caused <hi>Lot</hi> to commit Incest. It was Gluttony that made <hi>Esau</hi> to sell his Birth-right. It was Gluttony and Drunkenness that caused <hi>Nabal</hi>'s Death. It was Gluttony that lost <hi>Belshasars</hi> Kingdom.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>But let us a while leave this Rich Man, and consider the second, that which is the Life of the Beggar.</p>

                        <hi>There was also a certain Beggar, named</hi> Lazarus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And here observe these things: 1. That the Saints of God are a poor contemptible People. <hi>There was a certain Beggar:</hi> If you understand the word <hi>Beggar,</hi> to hold forth outward Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or scarcity in outward things, such are Saints of the Lord, for they are for the most part a poor, despised, contemptible People; but if you Allegorize and Interpret it thus, they are such as beg earnestly for Heavenly food; this is also the spirit of the Children of God, and it may be, and is a truth in this sense, though not so Naturally gathered from this Scripture. 2. <hi>That he was laid at his Gate full of Sores:</hi> These words hold forth the Distempers of Believers, saying, <hi>he was full of Sores;</hi> which may signifie the many Troubles, Temptations, Persecutions and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Body and Spirit, which they meet withal while they are in the World; And also the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments they find at the hands of those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ones, who Live upon the Earth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is said, <hi>he was laid at his Gate full of Sores.</hi> Mark, <hi>he was laid at his Gate;</hi> not in his House, that was thought too good for him, but <hi>he was laid at his Gate full of Sores:</hi> From whence Observe, that the Ungodly World do not desire to entertain and receive the poor Saints of God into their Houses; If they must needs be somewhere near unto them, yet they shall not come into their Houses: <hi>Shut them out of Doors!</hi> if they will needs be near us, let them be at the Gate. <hi>And he was laid at the Gate full of Sores.</hi> 2. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that the World are not at all touched with the afflictions of God's Children, for all they are full of Sores, a despised, afflicted, tempted, persecuted people, the World doth not pity; no, but rather
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52526:41"/>
labour to aggravate their Trouble by shutting them out of Doors, sink or swim, what cares the World? they are resolved to disown them, they will give them no Entertaiment; if the lying in the streets will do them any good, if hard Usage will do them any good, if to be disowned, shut out of Doors, rejected of the World will do them any good, they shall have enough of that, but otherwise, no Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no Comfort from the World: <hi>And he was laid at his Gate full of Sores.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Poor <hi>Lazarus!</hi> What, lying at a Gate. and full of Sores too? Would not this Rich Man afford thee some out-house to lie in, to shroud thee from Storms and Tempests? no: would not his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants pity thee? no: would not his Children speak for thee? no: Would not his Wife in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat her Husband for thee? no: Hadst thou ever done them any wrong; no: But, <hi>Lazarus,</hi> it may be thou art stout, and often-times Beggars will be chusers; thou perhaps wouldest have some great Alms, or Copy-hold, some Farm of this Rich Man? no: Or thou wouldest have some delicate Meat? no. Many Dishes? no: Or thou wouldest sit at the Table with his Sons and Servants? no, no: What is it then that thou dost desire? Nothing but Crumbs to refresh my Soul; nothing but Crumbs to save my Life: Nothing but Crumbs, Crumbs, that fall from the Rich Man's Table: I know that he fared Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, and that he may well spare them.</p>
                     <p>What shall I say of the hardness of this screwing Rich Mans Heart? Let me speak for <hi>Lazarus</hi> unto the Rich Man; yet I shall but <hi>asinam comere,</hi> (as one well observes) <hi>get nothing of this hard Fellow.</hi> I have a Message unto thee, O thou Rich Man, from the great God of Heaven, and he doth desire thee that thou respect the Beggar that lyeth at thy Gate pained with sores, pained with grief, and even
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52526:42"/>
arved through Hunger: And I beseech thee in Gods stead, that thou have pity on this Beggar, as God shall have pity, mercy, and Compassion on thee, and look what thou layest out, it shall be paid thee again. But he answered I warant you he is some Runnagate Rogue, and so long as he can be mantained by such easie means, he will never take any other Trade upon him: Nay, but good Sir, let please you only to behold this Poor Creature; which suppose it were granted: and he coming to the Gate where this wrerched Object lay, seeing him bewrayed with sores, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tattered with Rags, and the Dogs licking him, stopping his Nose, with a squeamish Face, and disdainful look, began to say unto him: <hi>I see thou art some lewd Fellow, that such Miseries hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen unto thee, and such Plagues come upon thee; it is not for thy goodness, or Righteousness, that these Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons light on thee.</hi> But he reply'd, <hi>O good Master, some Comfort, good Master, some Relief; good Master, some Crumbs to save my Life, I shall die else, and starve at your Gate; good Master, I beseech you for Gods sake, I beseech you for Christs sake, take some Pity, some Compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, some Mercy on me.</hi> But he with an Angry look, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining <hi>Lazarus,</hi> said: <hi>Away hence thou Idle Rogue, not a penny, not a Morsel, not a crumb of Bread;</hi> and so stopping his Nose from the scent, and his Ears from the Cry of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> returned unto his stately Palace: And this Poor mans Throat being dry with Crying, his Heart fainting for want of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, his tongue cleaving to the roof of his mouth, being worn out with Fastings and miseries, starved at the Rich Mans Gate. Now, must I speak for dead <hi>Lazarus</hi> against this Rich Man. <hi>Nam si hi tacuissent, nonne lapides clamabunt; if I should hold my peace, the very stones would cry. O thou Rich Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, and more than cruel wretch,</hi> Lazarus <hi>is dead,</hi>

                        <hi>he is dead at thy Gate, and his Blood shall be upon thee, thou shewedst no Mercy unto him, no Mercy shall be shewed to thee, thou stoppedst thy Ears unto his cry, thou shalt cry and not be heard. It is inhumane Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to have no Compassion on distressed</hi> Lazarus, <hi>but most of all, to let him starve at thy Gate for want of Food. What did be desire of thee but only Crumbs to save his Life? Is it not a small thing, I pray thee, that thou having abundance of Meat, shouldst see him starve for Bread? That thou flourishing in Purple and Silk, would see</hi> Lazarus <hi>lye in Rags? That thou seeing even thy Dogs have pity on him, thou wouldst have no pity upon him thy self? What Eyes hadst thou that wouldest not see his Sores? What Ears hadst thou, that wouldest not hear his cry? What Hands hadst thou that would not be stretched out to give, What Heart hadst thou that would not melt in thy Body? What Soul hadst thou, that would not pity his silly Soul, this wretched Body, poor</hi> Lazarus? <hi>If the stones could speak, they would cry, sie upon thee: If thy Dogs could speak, they would condemn thee of unmercifulness: If dead</hi> Lazarus <hi>were here, his Sores would bleed afresh before thy face, and cry in thine Ears, that thou art guilty, guilty of his Blood, and that thy sin is more than can be pardoned.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the Life of <hi>Lazarus</hi> I noted how he lived, to wit, miserably and full of Sores, and yet this rich Man would not pity him. Christ could not of his mercy but cure the Leper, when he saw him full of Sores and Leprosie; and <hi>Elisha</hi> could not but out of Humanity teach <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Assy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>ian</hi> to wash himself in <hi>Jordan,</hi> that he might be whole, but this rich Man would not help the poor Beggar, neither by his counsel, Purse, Table, or Crumbs, but let him alone to pining Misery at his Gate.</p>
                     <p>Here we note in the person of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> the great miseries and Afflictions that the Church of God doth endure in this World.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Great are the troubles of the Righteous,</hi> saith <hi>David;</hi> not small or few, but great and many, <hi>Psalm</hi> 34. Again, <hi>He will throughly purge his floor,</hi> not slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor by halves; thorowly, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. <hi>And he will search</hi> Jerusalem <hi>with Candle-light,</hi> lest he should over-slip any wickedness therein.</p>
                     <p>And further to prove this, we have many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in the Scripture, but that well known out of <hi>Job,</hi> may not be omitted, whose mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were more than many, and intolerable: As first, he being a just man, and one that feared God, to be thus plagued: For when one <hi>Messenger</hi> was relating tragical News to him, there came another on the neck of him, like the waves
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52526:43"/>
on the Sea. While he was yet speaking, there came another; While the other was yet speaking, there came another; yet this good <hi>Man</hi> had not so much as an hours respite to breath, or to receive comfort and consolation by any means: His goods were lost, his Body plagued, his Servants slain, his Sons were dead, and no Creature left alive to comfort him, but only a froward Wise to grieve and vex his heart. <hi>Miseria est copia tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis, &amp; inopia consolationis, quando multifariè quis pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titur: &amp; a nemine relevatur; Misery is then a Sea of tribulation, and scarce a drop of consolation, when a Man is oppressed many ways, and relieved by no means.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, In the Life of the Beggar we noted what he desired in this life, Crumbs, desired to be refreshed with the Crumbs that fell from the rich man's Table.</p>
                     <p>By these words our Lord Jesus doth shew us the frame of a Christians heart, and also the heart and carriage of worldly men towards the Saints of the Lord. The Christian's heart is held forth by this, that any thing will content him while he is on this side Glory; And he desired to be fed with the Crumbs, the Dogs meat, any thing; I say a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian will be content with any thing, if he have but to keep life and soul together (as we use to say) he is content, he is satisfied; he hath learned, if he hath learned to be a Christian, to be content with any thing? as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, I <hi>have learned in whatsoevir state I am, therewith to be content.</hi> He learns in all conditions to study to love God, to walk with God, to give up himself to God; and if the Crumbs that fall from the Rich mans Table will but satisfie nature, and give him bodily strength, that thereby he may be the more able to walk in the way of God, he is contented, <hi>and he desired to be fed with the Crumbs that fell</hi>
                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:52526:44"/>
                        <hi>from the Rich man's Table.</hi> But mark he had them not; you do not find that he had so much as a Crumb or scrap allowed unto him. No, then the Dogs will be beguiled, that must be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for the Dogs. From whence observe, that the ungodly world do love their Dogs better than the Children of God; you'll say that is strange: It is so indeed, yet it is true, as will be clearly manifested; as for instance, how many pounds do some men spend a year on their Dogs, when in the mean while, the poor Saints of God may starve for hunger? they will build Houses for their Dogs, when the Saints must be glad to wander, and lodge in Dens and Caves of the Earth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 38. and if they be in any of their Houses, for the hire thereof, they will warn them out, or Eject them, or pull down the House over their heads, rather than not rid themselves of such Tenants. Again, some men cannot go half a mile from home, but they must have Dogs at their heels, but they can very willingly go half a score miles without the society of a Christian. Nay, if when they are busie with their Dogs, they should chance to meet a Christian, they would willingly shift him if they could: they will go on the other side the Hedge or the way, rather than they will have any society with him; and if at any time a Child of God should come into a House where there are but two or three ungodly wretches, they do commonly wish either themselves or the Saints out of doors; and why so? because they cannot down with the society of a Christian: though if there come in at the same time a Dog, or a Drunken swearing wretch, which is worse than a Dog, they will make him welcom, he shall sit down with them, and partake of their Dainties. And now tell me, you that love your sins and your pleasures, had you not
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52526:44"/>
rather keep company with a Drunkard, a Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, a Strumpet, a Thief, nay a Dog, than with an honest-hearted Christian? If you say no, what means your four carriage to the People of God? Why do you look on them as if you would eat them up? yet at the very same time, if you can but meet with your Dog, or a drunken com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, you can fawn upon them, take acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with them, if it be two or three times in a Week: But if the Saints of God meet together, pray together, and labour to Edify one another, you will stay till Doomsday before you will look into the House where they are. Ah<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> Friends, when all comes to all, you will be found to love Drunkards, Strumpets, Dogs, any thing; nay to serve the Devil, rather than to have loving and friendly Society with the Saints of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Dogs came and licked his sores.</hi> The Rich Man's Dogs by licking <hi>Lazarus,</hi> taught their Master to have mercy on him, but he would not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had worse than a doggish Nature, and cruel Heart. But here first we note God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence toward his Children, he will have them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted and fed, though by dumb and only sensible Creatures; so the Dogs here came and licked <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s sores. So <hi>Elias</hi> was fed by <hi>Ravens</hi> to save his life, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 4. <hi>And thou shalt drink of the River: and I have commanded the Ravens to feed thee there.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But again, Secondly, In that, <hi>Dogs came and licked</hi> Lazarus<hi>'s Sores,</hi> when the Rich Man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self forsook him, we observe that sensible dumb Creatures of the Earth (are in their kinds) better<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than many men. Therefore it is that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth by the mouth of the Prophet; <hi>The Ox knoweth his owner, and the Ass his Masters Crib, but my People will not know me, saith the Lord.</hi>
                        <pb n="66" facs="tcp:52526:45"/>
So the Dogs here knew <hi>Lazarus</hi> to be pained, but the Rich man would not vouchsafe to know him: Therefore his own Dogs condemned him of merciless Cruelty.</p>
                     <p>Here Beloved, you may see not only the <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted state</hi> of the Saints of God in this World, but also, that even <hi>Dogs</hi> themselves, according to their kind, are more favourable to the Saints than the sinful World; though the ungodly will have no mercy on the Saints, yet it is ordered so that these Creatures, Dogs, Lions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will. <hi>Though the Rich Man would not entertain him into his House, yet his Dogs will come and do him the best good they can, even to lick his running Sores.</hi> It was thus with <hi>Daniel,</hi> when the World was against him, and would have thrown him to the Lions to be devoured: the Lions shut their mouths at him; so that there was not that hurt befel to him as was desired by the Adversaries, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.</p>
                     <p>But now let us consider the Third Part, which is the Death of the Beggar.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It was so that the Beggar died.</hi> Here is the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage fulfilled, <hi>Mors optima rapit, deterrima relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit.</hi> Now must I speak of Tragical matters, of Funerals and Obsequies, of Dissolution and Death.</p>
                     <p>This Beggar died, that represents the Godly; and the Rich Man died, that represents the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly: From whence Observe, neither Godly nor Ungodly must live always without a change either by Death or Judgment: The good man died, and the bad man died; that Scripture doth also back this Truth, that good and bad must die, marvellous well, where it is said, <hi>And it is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to men once to die, and after that the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Heb. 9. 27.</p>
                     <p>Now, when it is said, the Beggar died, and the Rich man died, part of the meaning is, they ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52526:45"/>
to be any more in this World I say, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the meaning is so, but not altogether, though it be altogether the meaning, when some of the Creatures die, yet it is but in part the meaning, when it is said, that Men, Women, or Children die; for there is to them something else to be said more than a barely going out of the World; for if when unregenerate Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men die, there were an end of them, not only in this World, but also in the World to come, they would be more happy than now; for when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men and women die, there is that to come after Death, that will be very terrible to them, namely, to be carryed by the Angels of Darkness from their Death beds to Hell, there to be reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the Judgment of the great day, when both Body and Soul shall meet and be united together again, and made capable to undergo the uttermost vengeance of the Almighty to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Ah, Beloved, if this great Truth, that men must die, and depart this World, and either enter into Joy, or else into Prison, to be reserved to the Day of Judgment, were believed, we should not have so many Wantons walk up and down the streets as there do; at least, it would put a mighty check to their filthy Carriages, so that they would not, could not walk so basely and sinfully as they do. <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> notwithstanding he was so far from the fear of God as he was, yet when he did but see that God was but offended, and threatned him for his Wickedness, it made him hang down his head, and knock his knees together, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 5, 6. If you read the Verses before, you will find, he was careless, and satisfying his Lusts in Drinking, and playing the Wanton with his Concubines: But so soon as he did perceive the Finger of an hand writing, <hi>Then</hi> (saith the Scripture) <hi>the King's</hi>
                        <pb n="68" facs="tcp:52526:46"/>
                        <hi>countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joynts of his Loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.</hi> And when <hi>Paul</hi> told <hi>Felix</hi> of Righteousness, Temperance, and Judgment to come, it made him tremble. Further, this is a certain truth, that not only the Wicked, but the Godly also must have a time to depart this Life. <hi>And the Beggar died;</hi> the Saints of the Lord they must be deprived of this Life also, they must yield up the Ghost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the Lord their God; they must also be separated from their Wives, Children, Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, Friends, Goods, and all that they have in the World, for God hath decreed it: <hi>It is appointed,</hi> namely, by the Lord, <hi>for Men once to die, and we must appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ,</hi> as it is, 2 Cor. 5. 10, 11.</p>
                     <p>But again, in the Death of the Beggar: First we noted what became of his Soul, <hi>It was carried by Angels into</hi> Abrahams <hi>Bosom.</hi> Whereby we learn the Immortality of the Soul. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was the first among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> that taught the Soul was Immortal. The Philosophers also, and Heathen Poets do prove the Immortality of the Soul.</p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>Cedit enim retro de terra quod fuit ante</l>
                        <l>In terram, sed <hi>quod</hi> missum est ex aetheris oris</l>
                        <l>Id rursum coeli fulgentia templa receptant.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The part of Man that was made of Earth, went to Earth, and that part as came from Heaven, went to Heaven again.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But leaving these, we prove by Scripture the Immortality of the Soul, <hi>Man was made a living Soul.</hi> Therefore the Soul is Immortal. And here in the Text, <hi>Lazarus</hi> being dead, <hi>his Soul was carried into</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Bosom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

Here therefore is the damnable Opinion of the <hi>Atheists</hi> overthrown: For if they deny God, they must also deny that they have Souls, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that they are not men. But St. <hi>John</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, that all things were made by the Word of God, and without it nothing was made; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they are made, they are made by the Word of God, and of a reasonable Soul, which do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and believe in the Creator. <hi>Anima est primum principium vitae per se subsistens, incorporea ac incorruptibilis: The Soul is the first beginning of Life, subsisting of it self, incorporeal and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible.</hi> St. <hi>Austin, Anima est spiritus, est substantia incorporea, corporis sui vita sensibilis, invisibilis, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionalis, immortalis. The Soul of man is a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, or incorporeal substance, sensible, invisible, reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, immortal:</hi> For as he also saith, <hi>Solum homo habet animam rationalem: Only Man with an Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Soul. Lazarus</hi> Soul was carried into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Bosom, which is a quiet Haven, which the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful have gotten by the troublesom Navigation of this Life, that is, the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Here therefore we note that the Souls of the Elect being separated from their Bodies, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently in Joys, and are carried into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som; so called, because it belongeth only to the Faithful. Well then, <hi>Lazarus</hi> Soul went to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and Christ said to the Thief on the Cross, <hi>This day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.</hi> Not to morrow or next Year, but this day. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Souls of the Elect being separated from their Bodies, are in Joy and Rest. As also on the other side, the soul of the Rich man and the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, after they be separated from their Bodies, are in Hell Torments.</p>
                     <p>And thus much concerning the place whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Lazarus</hi> soul was carried, being dead; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Bosom.</p>

But the Ungodly are not so, but are hurried by the Devils into the Bottomless Pit, drawn away in their Wickedness, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 32. for he saith, <hi>And in Hell he lift up his Eyes;</hi> when the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly do die, their misery beginneth, for then appear the Devils like so many Lions, waiting every moment till the soul depart from the Body; sometimes they are very visible to the dying Party, but sometimes more invisible: But always this is certain, they never miss of the soul, if it do die out of the Lord Jesus Christ, but do hale it away to their Prison, as I said before, there to be tormented and reserved until the great and dreadful day of Judgment, at which day they must, Body and Soul, receive a final Sentence from the Righteous Judge, and from that time be shut out from the Presence of God into everlasting woe and distress. But the Godly, when the time of their departure is at hand, then are also the Angels of the Lord at hand; yea, they are ready waiting on the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52526:47"/>
Soul, to conduct it safely into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Bosom. I do not say, but the Devils oft-times are very bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>e doubtless, and attending the Saints in their Sickness; yes, and no question, but they would willingly deprive the soul of Glory. But here is the comfort, as the Devils come from Hell to devour the soul (if it be possible, at it's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture) so the Angels of the Lord come from Heaven, to watch over and conduct the soul (in spight of the Devil) safe into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>David</hi> had the comfort of this, and speaks it forth for the comfort of his Brethren, <hi>Psal.</hi> 34. 7. saying, <hi>The Angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.</hi> Mark, the Angel of the Lord encampeth round about his Children, to deliver them: From what? From their Enemies, of which the Devil is not the least: This is an excellent comfort at any time, to have the holy Angels of God to attend a Poor Man or Woman, but especially it is comfortable in the time of distress, at the time of Death, when the Devils beset the Soul with all the Power that Hell can afford them, but now it may be, that the glorious Angels of God do not appear at the first, to the view of the Soul; nay, rather Hell stands before it, and the Devils ready, as if they would carry it thither, but this is the comfort, the Angels do always appear at the last, and will not fail the soul, but will carry it safe into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s bosom. Ah! Friends, consider, here is an ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man upon his Death-bed, and he hath none to speak for him, none to speak comfort unto him, but it is not so with the Children of God, for they have the spirit to comfort them. Here is the ungodly, and they have no Christ to pray
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52526:48"/>
for their safe Conduct to Glory, but the Saints have an Intercessor, <hi>John</hi> 17. 9. Here is the World, when they die, they have none of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God to attend upon them, but the Saints have their Company. In a word, the unconvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed person when he dieth, he sinks into the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless Pit; but the Saints when they die, do as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend with and by the Angels into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Bosom, or into unspeakable Glory, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 34.</p>
                     <p>And so let us consider the fourth and last part, which is the Death of the Rich Man.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Rich Man died also,</hi> &amp;c. Here we may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain see, that Death is the way of all flesh. Death shaketh Cedar and Shrub, Death calleth away the Rich man from his pleasure, and <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> from his Pain, and all must obey when Death calleth. It is not the Majesty of a Prince nor Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of a Priest, strength of Body, feature of Face, Wisdom, Beauty, Riches, Honour, nor any such secular regard can plead against Death, or priviledge a man from the Grave, <hi>Statutum est omnibus semel mori: The Decree is out, all must die once;</hi> all must taste of this distasteful cup of death. Let us know then that the <hi>Pale Horse,</hi> and he that sitteth thereon, whose name is <hi>Death,</hi> comes run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning on towards us, fall that is within us, and without us, are Remembrancers of <hi>Death.</hi> The Sun rising in the East, and setting in the West, sheweth our rising and alling, our coming in and going out of this World. All cry unto us we must away, we must away, we must hence, as Christ said, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World.</hi> Death is a separation of the Soul from the Body; the Husband separated from the Wife of his youth; the Father separated from his Children whom he dearly loved; the Children from their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, the Master from his Servant, and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52526:48"/>
from his Master, thus Parents and Friends' and all must part.</p>
                     <p>The first circumstance of the Rich man is, to know what became of his Body? It was honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly buried. But here we see that honourable Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial doth not profit the damned soul. Tares are sown as well as Wheat in all times; if the one grow up for the fire, the other for the barn; <hi>Gather the Tares in bundles, and burn them, but gather the Wheat into my barn,</hi> Matth. 1. 30.</p>
                     <p>But let us lastly consider what became of his Soul.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And being in Hell Torments,</hi> &amp;c. But because none can so well relate miseries, and none can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the torments of Hell so well as he that hath felt the same, let the Rich man himself speak, and let us hear him what he saith, he being in Hell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he thus beginneth: <hi>O wretch that I am, why did I suffer</hi> Lazarus <hi>to starve at my Gate? for which I am shut in the Gates of Hell. Why did</hi> I <hi>not give</hi> Lazarus <hi>a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </p>

                     <p>But to conclude all in one word, and to apply all that hath been spoken to this present time and place, let us all in our vocations and places follow the advice of a late Eminent Pen, <hi>viz.</hi> to learn to have mercy on <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that is, on our poor Brethren, that we may find mercy, and that mercy may rejoyce in Judgment: and you that are Magistrates of this City, think upon

                        <hi>Lazarus</hi> that lyeth in your Streets, that pineth at your gates, that starveth in your Prisons for want of Crumbs: Heark, how they cry Bread, bread, a loaf of bread for Jesus sake. Who would not hear them? who would not pity them? who would not comfort them? Also see that you chuse good and merciful Officers in your Spittles and Hospitals, that may feed <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and not fill their own Purses and Bellies, as the rich man did. And you that sit in the seat of Judgment, and are <hi>Gods</hi> here on earth, let the matter be rightly judged between the rich man and poor <hi>Lazarus;</hi> let equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be in your right hand, and justice in your left; consider that <hi>Lazarus</hi> is poor, and that he is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to wage Law against the rich man, yet defend him and let him have right.

                     <hi>NOw where am I?</hi> If I look behind me, I see Death hastning after me, nay, that Death is at my Back: If I look forward, I see Heaven and Hell before me, my selfstanding on the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry brink of Time, and my next step (for ought I know) may be into Eternity of joy or sorrow, where I did but now by Faith see o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were, there I my self must quickly really be, there I shall rejoyce with them. If I look a <hi>little before me,</hi> I may see my self cast down upon a <hi>Bed of sickness;</hi> my Friends weeping, and fearing I shall die; the Physicians are puzled, and at a loss, giving me over for the Grave, and my self <hi>gasping for Life,</hi> and breathing out my last. If I look but a little before me, I can as it were hear my Friends saying, <hi>He is dead, he is dead, he is gone, he is departed,</hi> and then (as it were) I might see them haling me out of my Bed, and wrapping me in <hi>My Winding Sheet, and nailing me up in my Coffin.</hi> I might see my Grave a digging, and men hired to carry me on their shoulders from my house to my Long Home, <hi>Relations</hi> and <hi>Neighbours</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing after to see me lodged in the Dust, to lye and rot among the Dead.</p>
                  <p>But before all this can be done to <hi>my Body,</hi> my Soul hath taken it's <hi>flight into Eternity,</hi> where it is without change or alteration, for ever to be with God or Devils. Oh that I could then work it on my heart, that I must

quickly be either in <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Hell,</hi> that I have a long Race to run by a short breath, (if I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Heaven,)</hi> a great way to go in a few hours.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sun</hi> who goes so many miles in a minute, the <hi>stars</hi> of the <hi>firmament,</hi> which go so very many more, go not so fast, as my <hi>body</hi> to the <hi>Earth.</hi> In the same instant that I feel the first attempt of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, I feel the victory; In the twinkling of an eye, I can scarce see; instantly the tast is insipid and fatuous; instantly the appetite is dull and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireless: instantly the knees are sinking and strengthless; and in an instant, sleep, which is the <hi>Picture,</hi> the <hi>copy</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> is taken away, that the <hi>original, Death</hi> it self may succeed, and that so I might have death to the life</p>
                  <p>To return from the dead, is impossible; all my life then I will prepare for death.</p>
                  <p>They call death <hi>Charons</hi> boat, I am sure it wafts the Soul from a material to an immateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al World.</p>
                  <p>I have but one step to Eternity: it is from life to death, I will be preparing this body of mine, to win the garland of a blessed Immortality.</p>
                  <p>O the serious thoughts while I live! How I must die, these do so make me run, that I may obtain a Crown of glory.</p>
                  <p>The sound of the <hi>Passing Bell</hi> assures me there is some to day likely to die; <hi>it is so nigh Night,</hi> it is high time then to work out my Salvation; lest the Night of death put in, and none can work.</p>
                  <p>I have a task set will take up all my time, <hi>viz. to die well;</hi> while I live then, I will learn to die; lest being found unprepared, it be said, <hi>Thou fool, this night thy Soul shall be required of thee.</hi>

                     <head>The first step of dying well.</head>
                     <p>OFten meditation of Death brings a man to die in ease; for it alleviates pains, expels fear, eases cares, cures sins, corrects death it self. The very Thought of Eternity will make easie and pleasant all things we suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in a miserable Life.</p>

                     <p>Every Humour in us engenders Diseases e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to kill us, so that our Bodies are but living Graves; and we die not because we are,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52526:56"/>
sick, but because we live. And when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover from sickness, we escape not sickness, but the disease: All this life is but a death of an hour.</p>

                     <head>Familiarity with Death, a soveraign Cordial against Death.</head>
                     <p>THerefore be acquainted with Death betimes; for through acquaintance, death will lose his horror; like unto an ill Face, though it be as formidable as a monster, yet often viewing will make it familiar, and free it from distaste: walk every day, with <hi>Joseph,</hi> a turn or two in thy Garden with death, and thou shalt be well acquainted with the face of death; but shalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver feel the sting of death: Death is black, but comely. <hi>Philostrates</hi> lived seven years in his Tomb, that he might be acquainted with it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his bones came to lye in it. Some Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers have been so wrapt in this contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Death, and Immortality, that they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course so familiarly and pleasingly of it, as if a fair death were to be preferred before a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant life.</p>
                     <p>This is well for <hi>Nature's</hi> part; and <hi>Moralists</hi> think this enough for their part to conceive so: But <hi>Christians</hi> must go farther; and search deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: <hi>They</hi> must try where the power of death lyes. They shall find that the power of every man's death lyes in his own sin; That death ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hurts a man but with his own weapons: It always turns upon us, some sin it finds in us. <hi>The sting of Death is sin:</hi> Pluck out the sting, death cannot hurt us. The way to die well, is to die often. Let a man often and seriously
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52526:57"/>
think of dying, then let him sin if he can, said <hi>Picus Mirandula.</hi> In <hi>Sardis</hi> there grew an Herb cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Appium Sardis,</hi> that would make a Man lie laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when he was deadly sick: Such is the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sin. Beware therefore of this <hi>[Risus Sardoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus]</hi> laughter of <hi>Sardis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We count it a fearful thing for a man to be author of his own death; but a sinful life slays the soul. and so while we live, we kill or lose our better life. The Commandment that says, <hi>Thou shalt not kill,</hi> es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially forbids the murthering of our own Souls. And herein is our happiness; though we live in sin, yet we die without sin. Therefore to me Death is welcome; not as an end of troubles, but of sin. <hi>Into thy hands I commend my Spirit, for thou hast re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed me, O Lord God of Truth.</hi>

                     <p>THE second step to dying-well, is, to die daily. Methinks, O my Soul, it is but yesterday since we met, and now we are upon parting; neither shall we, I hope, be unwilling to take our leaves: for, what advantage can it be to us to hold out longer together. Are we not assured that if our earthly house of this Tabernacle were dissolved, <hi>we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens?</hi> Why therefore, O my Soul, shouldst thou be loth to part upon fair terms? Thou, O my Soul, to the possession of that happy Mansion, which thy dear Saviour hath, from all Eternity, prepared for thee in his Father's house: and thou, O my body, to that quiet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pository of the grave; till ye both shall happily meet in the blessed Resurrection of the Just.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I die, that I may not die. I die daily,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Paul. So many days as thou livest, reckon so many lives; for he that disposeth all his days as one life, can neither wish nor fear to morrow.</hi>

The old saying is a good saying; Do that every day, which thou wouldst do the same day that thou diest. <hi>'Tis an excellent thing to make all we can of life, before Death.</hi>

                     <p>THE third step to dying well is, to die by little and little.</p>
                     <p>Naturally we are every day dying by degrees: the faculties of our minds, the strength of our bodies, our common senses are every day decaying, by little and little: every sin is more than a disease, and a wicked life makes a continual death. <hi>Impie vivere est diu mori; To live wickedly, is to be long a dying:</hi> Therefore saith the good Man, <hi>We are killed all the day long.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He that useth this course every day. To die by little and little, to him (let Death come when it will) it can neither be terrible nor sudden.</p>
                     <p>If we keep <hi>a Courser to run a Race,</hi> we lead him daily over the place, to acquaint him by degrees with all things in the way, that when he comes upon his speed, he do not start or turn aside for any thing he sees. So let us inure our souls; and then <hi>we shall run with boldness the race that is set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, looking to Jesus, the Author and finisher of our salvation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To die by little and little, is first to mortifie our lesser sins, and not to say with <hi>Lot, Is it not a little one?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There be also a sort of little deaths, sickness of body, loss of Friends, and the like: Use these in their kind, and you may make them kindly helps to dying well.</p>

                     <p>AMongst Men it is a matter of chief mark, the manner of a man's death. <hi>The chief good of Man, is his good departure out of this life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Before you die, set your house in order: He that hath not a house, yet hath a soul; no soul can want affairs to set in order, for this final dissolution.</p>
                     <p>The chief grace of the Theatre, is the last
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52526:58"/>
Scene. It is the Evening that Crowns the day; and we think it no good sign of a fair Morrow, when the Sun sets in a Cloud: <hi>The end Crowns every Work.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Most men wish a short Death, because death is always accompanied with pain. <hi>We die groaning.</hi> To lie but an hour under Death is tedious, but to be dying a whole day, we think beyond the strength of humane patience: He that <hi>desires to be dissolved, and be with Christ,</hi> dies not only pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, but delightfully. Happy is he, that after due preparation, dies ere he be aware; so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise is he happy that, by long sickness, sees death afar off; for the one dies like <hi>Elias,</hi> the other like <hi>Elisha:</hi> both blessedly.</p>
                     <p>The best posture to be found in when Death comes, is in the exercise of our calling: <hi>Press,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, towards the mark for the prize of the high calling,</hi> Phil. 3.</p>
                     <p>A good Man, by his good will, would die <hi>praying,</hi> and do as the Pilgrim doth, go on his way <hi>singing,</hi> and so adds the pains of singing to that of going; Who yet by this surplus of pain, unwearies himself of pain.</p>
                     <p>But some wretches think God rather curious, than they faulty, if a few sighs, with a <hi>[Lord have mercy upon us,]</hi> be not enough at the last gasp.</p>
                     <p>But commonly good Men are best at last, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when they are dying. It was a Speech worthy the commendation, and frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of so divine a Bishop as <hi>Augustine,</hi> which is reported of an aged Father, in his time; who, when his Friends comforted him on his sick bed, and told him, they hoped he should recover; answered, <hi>If I shall not die at all, well; but if ever, why not now?</hi> Surely it is folly,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:52526:59"/>
what we must do, to do unwillingly. I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think my Soul in a good case, so long as I am loth to think of dying.</p>
                     <p>There is no Spectacle in the World so profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or more terrible, than to behold a dying man; to stand by, and see a man dismanned. <hi>Curiously didst thou make me in the lowest part of the Earth,</hi> saith <hi>David:</hi> but to see those Elements which compounded, made the Body: To see them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and the man dissolved, is a ruful sight.</p>
                     <p>Every dying man carries Heaven and Earth wrapped up in his bosom, and at this time each part returns homeward.</p>
                     <p>Certainly, death hath great dependency on the course of man's life, and life it self is as frail as the Body which it animates. <hi>Augustus Caesar accounted that to be the best death which is quick and unexpected, and which beats not at our doors by any painful sickness.</hi> So often as he heard of a man that had a quick passage, with little sense of pain, he wished for himself that <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thana<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>ie:</hi> While he lived he used to set himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his two friends, <hi>Groans and Tears.</hi> When he died he called for his Looking-glass command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have his Hair and Beard kembed, <hi>his reviled cheeks smoothed up.</hi> Then asking his Friends, if he acted his part well, when they answered, <hi>Yes; why then,</hi> says he, <hi>do you not all clap your hands for me?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Despair in dying, may as well arise from weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Nature, as from trouble of Mind: But by neither of these can he be prejudiced, that hath lived well.</p>
                     <p>Raving, and other strange Passions, are many times rather the effect of the Disease, than coming from the mind. For upon Death's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, choler <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

distempers in the most patient Soul. In these cases, the fairest and truest judgment to be made is, that sins of sickness occasioned by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Disease in a patient man, are but sins of infirmity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not to be taken as ill signs or presages; <hi>A Son of so many Tears</hi> cannot but be saved.

                     </gap> Brother; and <hi>the Jews also wept,</hi> vers. 33. yet it was but for a common Friend: But what was all that to the death of a Husband? O my Husband, my Husband!

But oh, he is dead, he is dead: He cannot hear me he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not behold me; he cannot answer me: His Ears are locked up, his Eyes are closed, his mouth is sealed, his Soul is gone. O what shall I do for <hi>my head, my guide, my heart, my Husband?</hi> Were <hi>my</hi> Saviour upon Earth again, I could send one to him as <hi>Mary</hi> did, who should say, <hi>Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is dead.</hi> Dead, say I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> O dead, dead; he is gone; he is departed, and can never be recalled. But why? Why can he not be called back again? Did not my Jesus cause <hi>Lazarus</hi> to arise when he had been <hi>four days dead?</hi> ver. 39. Yes, he did: But what then? I neither love my Saviour so well as <hi>Mary</hi> did, nor
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52526:62"/>
(I fear) doth he love me so well as he did <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> or if both were so, yet since Miracles are ceased, I cannot so much as hope that he will call back the Spirit of my Lord, my Husband. Oh could he be wooed by the Tears of a sinful Woman, never did any mourn so much as I would. But nothing will perswade: I seek but the distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of him whom <hi>I</hi> mourn for, if <hi>I</hi> desire to call him from his eternal rest.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Sarah</hi> died in <hi>Kirjath-Arba, Abraham</hi> stood <hi>up from before his deceased Wife, and spake unto the Sons of</hi> Heth, <hi>saying, I am a stranger, and a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journer with you: Give me a Possession, and a bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight,</hi> Gen. 23. 3, 4. Though he so tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected her whilst she was living, yet he would not look too long on her when she was dead. It is a duty as full of humanity to interr with decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy the Bodies of the dead, as it is of Religion to love the Persons when they are alive. Yet vain is man in this affection, if he fixeth his love only on the beauty of the body. This flesh which is so tender, this skin which I strive to preserve both smooth and white, must one day be a banquet for the loathed Worms. No greater priviledge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to me than did to my Husband; for the time will come when <hi>I</hi> shall follow him to the Earth. Had <hi>I</hi> loved only his outward form, my love should now either be quite forgotten, or else <hi>I</hi> should fondly desire to deny it interment: But it was his body enlivened with a rich and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Soul, which drew mine affection, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded my desires. Had that Soul and body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued their Society, <hi>I</hi> had been freed from my laments: but they have bid farewell till the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Resurrection, and hence am <hi>I</hi> enforced to utter my complaints. <hi>I</hi> weep for my loss be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52526:62"/>
we are divorced: But oh what conflicts then can I imagin that he had, when he was not only to part from his indeared Wife; but likewise his Soul was to leave this chillowed Earth! Oh for him, for him, for my loss of him do <hi>I</hi> pay the tribute of these watering Eyes. Yet these tears must not flow in too great abundance, lest by them <hi>I</hi> should seem to envy his happiness. Even when his body shall be layed to sleep in the grave, if <hi>I</hi> mourn too much, it will be justly suspected that too much <hi>I</hi> loved the worst of my Husband. His Soul, which was his best, is now in perfection, and may not be lamented: his Body which is the worst and grosser part of him, is now to be committed to the Earth whence it came. Thither it must go, to that place <hi>I</hi> must commend it; otherwise my former love may be turned into loathing: and that which <hi>I</hi> esteemed when it was alive, <hi>I</hi> shall be forced to abhor, if <hi>I</hi> keep it from the Grave. O it grieveth me each minute that <hi>I</hi> think of my dearest; it troubleth and perplexeth me with disturbed thoughts, when <hi>I</hi> consider how frequently <hi>I</hi> loved him, yet cannot enliven him. But these are only the fond concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of an erring phantasie; and tell me that <hi>I</hi> loved him more than <hi>I</hi> should, or else now <hi>I</hi> would not grieve so much as <hi>I</hi> do. If my love to God be so great as <hi>I</hi> pretend, <hi>I</hi> shall thankfully acknowledg his Love to the departed. O let it never be said that my Love was Idolatry, in affecting him, too much, who is but dust and ashes.</p>
                  <p>But why sit <hi>I</hi> musing in these pensive thoughts when <hi>I</hi> should rather prepare for the burial of the dead? Have <hi>I</hi> taken a course for the place of his Rest, where his cold body may be laid to sleep? This is a duty which every age hath been careful to perform. It was a greater argument of <hi>Jehoja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim</hi>'s
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52526:63"/>
fury against <hi>Uriah</hi> the Prophet, that <hi>he cast his dead body into the graves of the common People, than that he slew him with the Sword,</hi> Jer. 26. 23. It hath also been a testimony of God's revenge, when he suffered not the dead to have a decent interment. <hi>If a Man beget an hundred Children</hi> (saith the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) <hi>and live many years, so that the days of his years be many; and his Soul be not filled with good, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that he have no burial, I say that an untimely birth is better than he,</hi> Eccles. 6. 3. When the Man of God had disobeyed his command, the old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet told him, saying, <hi>Thy Carcass shall not come into the Sepulcher of thy Fathers,</hi> 1 King. 13. 22. This Curse was accounted as full of dread, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that was sent upon the Sons of Men.</p>
                  <p>But on the contrary <hi>Abijah</hi> the Prophet telleth the Wife of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> concerning her sick son <hi>Abijah,</hi> saying, <hi>Arise, get thee to thine house; and when thy feet enter into the city, the Child shall die: But all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him; for he only of</hi> Jeroboam <hi>shall come to the Grave, because in him there is found some good thing towards the Lord God of Israel in the house of</hi> Jeroboam, 1 Kings 14. 12, 13. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, when <hi>Huldah</hi> the Prophetess did foretell the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> but a respite thereof in the time of <hi>Josiah,</hi> she told him, saying, Behold, saith the Lord, <hi>I will gather thee to thy Fathers; and thou shalt be gathered into thy Grave in peace,</hi> 2 Kings 22. 20. Thus hath it often discovered the wrath of the Almighty, when the carkasses of the dead have been denyed their funerals: and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it hath sometimes manifested his love, when they have peaceably been brought to their longest home. Burial is the last of duties which we owe unto our friends, to which both religion, and nature, and civility do prompt us forward. When <hi>Isaac, being old and full of days, did give up</hi>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:52526:63"/>
                     <hi>the Ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people; his two sons</hi> Esau <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>buried him,</hi> Gen. 35. 29. When <hi>John</hi> the Baptist was beheaded in the prison <hi>his disciples came and took up the body, and buried it,</hi> Mat. 14. 12. The disciple that was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to follow my Redeemer, yet accounted it his duty to attend on the funeral of his deceased Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore desired, saying, <hi>Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my Father,</hi> cap. 8. 21.</p>
                  <p>Even the glutton in the Gospel had so much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour as to be brought to his Grave: so saith the text; <hi>The rich man also died, and was buried,</hi> Lu. 16. 22.</p>
                  <p>It is then the duty of the living to provide even for the dead, that they may be buried in peace.</p>
                  <p>But is it a matter of any moment in what place we lay the bodies of our deceased friends? Is it not all one, whether in the fields, or whether in our Golgotha's? No doubtless, for even the laws of our land are so justly severe against Idolaters, that we suffer not the convicted to be buried in our ground which is dedicated to this use. Neither may they be permitted to mix with our dead, who have desperately become the murderers of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: but they lye in the roads, where a stake is set up, to give notice to passengers that they unnaturally hastened their own departure. Is it a matter of some moment to us who are living, that we lay our deceased friends in a place conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient: for although it extendeth not to their knowledge, yet it redoundeth to their honour.</p>
                  <p>But is it not all one in what part of the ground I bury my Husband, so I lay his body in a place that is set apart for that purpose? Surely no; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is equal to him, yet is it not to me. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though at the resurrection we shall meet again, at what distance soever our Graves shall be made;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52526:64"/>
yet there is some reason we should be buried so near as we may, that as our bodies were injoyned a mutual society in the time of life so they might also sleep together in the silent dust. It is but just that one grave should receive the bodies of us, for whom one bed was designed upon earth; that as in our lives we were made one flesh, so after our deaths we should make one lump. When <hi>Barzillai</hi> was offered a favour from King <hi>David,</hi> and wooed to spend his time at the Court, he besought the King, saying, <hi>Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my Father, and of my Mother,</hi> 2 Sam. 19. 37. Friends have ever desired to lye by friends, that those especially who were knit together in <hi>blood</hi> &amp; <hi>affection,</hi> might be joyned together in their <hi>earth</hi> and <hi>ashes.</hi> In the Cave of <hi>Machpelah</hi> which <hi>Abraham bought of Ephron for four hundred shekels of silver,</hi> was buried both <hi>himself, and</hi> Sarah <hi>his wife,</hi> Gen. 23. 16. There lay <hi>Isaac, and Rebekah his wife,</hi> cap. 49. 31. and there lay <hi>Leah,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> her husband, chap. 50. 13. Though <hi>Saphira</hi> died by the judgment of God for the lye she had told: yet when she fell dead <hi>at Peter's feet, and yielded up the Ghost, the young men came in, and carried her forth, and buried her by her Husband,</hi> Act. 5. 10. It is therefore convenient that I choose a place for burial of my Husband, where (if so it may be) I my self may be layed. Convenient it is, but not absolutely necessary; for the souls shall not enjoy the less felicity for the remoter distance, and separation of the bodies: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall the bodies either be sensible of the disjunction; or shall it retard their meeting at the general day. Although the bones of <hi>Jacob</hi> were <hi>carried into the land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>and buried in the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Thus do I sit and muse about the burial of him whom so dearly I loved. Yet methinks I could most readily preserve him from the dust, if either it were in my power, or might bring me content. But go he must, and I must follow him. This nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row room of his coffin must be put in trust with his mouldring earth: and he who in his life time was entertained with variety of spacious chambers, must now securely sleep in the chamber of a Grave. O how it grieveth me to see this effect of sin! Had not Adam fallen, my husband had not died. But oh, he's dead; and since nor tears, nor sigh's, nor groans, nor cries have power to recall him, it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my duty, and it shall be my care to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press my love to him in the rites of his fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. Friends shall carry him; neighbours shall attend on him; and my tears shall embalm him. The preacher shall be instructed in the vertue which adorned him, that so he may commend them to others for their due imitation. The hearers shall greedily attend to the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the dead; and not only acknowledg their truth, but contentedly wish like him to live, and like him to die.</p>
                  <p>Now, O now another storm approacheth in mine eyes: for the company beginneth to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach my doors; and my neighbours and my friends are hastening to my house. But when they come let them not think to comfort me, lest they add to my grief while they vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly strive to conquer my Passion. I cannot allow
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52526:65"/>
an intermission or forbearance of Tears, lest I should appear unnatural. If I do not weep, I I did not love. O methinks I could willingly weep my self into a Statue, that I might become his monument. It is the height of injustice to forbid <hi>my</hi> Tears, since the delight of mine <hi>Eyes</hi> is now to be carryed to the place of Oblivion. Methinks every thing seemeth to call for a <hi>Tear,</hi> which is the object of a Sense. Those Bells which so mournfully accord in their Tunes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite my Neighbours to come to the <hi>Funeral;</hi> yet not to appear with <hi>empty Eyes,</hi> unless they come to learn how to weep.

So ready were these Spriggs to come when I desired them, that they slipped from their stems to attend these obsequies.

When <hi>Mary Magdalen stood weeping at the feet of</hi> my <hi>Saviour, and did wash his Feet with Tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head,</hi> and <hi>brought an Alabaster Box of Ointment,</hi> and <hi>anointed him with the Ointment,</hi> Luke 7. 37, 38. He was so far from disliking it in her, that he checked his Disciples who had indignation at the Act, and therefore said, <hi>To what purpose is this waste?</hi> Yea, he reproved them, and said unto them, <hi>Why trouble ye the Woman? For she hath wrought a good work upon me: For in that she hath pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Ointment on my Body, she did it for my Burial,</hi> Mat. 26. 8, 10, 12. <hi>She hath done what she could; she is come aforehand to anoint my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to the burying,</hi> Mar. 14. 8. Here, I find, was Ointment to embalm him; and here were also Tears at his Funeral: And yet so far was Christ from blaming her for her Tears, that he not only decreed the <hi>publishing of this Act through the World where the Gospel should be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and that <hi>for a Memorial of her,</hi> Mat. 26. 13. but he likewise upbraided <hi>Simon</hi> with the tears of the sinner, and said unto him, <hi>I entred into thine house, and thou gavest me no water for my feet; but she hath washed my feet with Tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Wherefore her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much,</hi> Luke 7. 44, 47. Weep then I may upon this sad occasion; yea, and weep may my Friends too. Tears are as proper at a Funeral, as Smiles at a Wedding. We have two Marriages; the first whereof is to

                     <hi>living Dust;</hi> the last to the cold and silent <hi>Earth.</hi> At the former we rejoyce, for it was an institution of God before <hi>Man had sinned,</hi> Gen. 2. 24. At the latter we weep, for it is the effect of sin. We cloath our selves in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful Colours, when we celebrate the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: But our <hi>Blacks</hi> at the latter are our <hi>Wedding Garments.</hi> The <hi>Rosemary</hi> is served about at each: The <hi>Gloves</hi> and the <hi>Favours</hi> attend at each: The <hi>Wine,</hi> and the other accustomed <hi>Entertainments</hi> are given at each: We go to the <hi>Church</hi> for the consummation of each: On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here is the difference, that at the one we rejoice, but at the other we mourn. Every <hi>Guest</hi> that is willing to comply with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent occasion, must as well be sad at this, as be merry at the other. Weep we may, and weep we must; especially my self who have lost my self. But yet let me take heed that I offend not in my Tears, lest that which is my Duty be turned into a Crime. I must es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially take heed that I err not in the cause of these Laments: for if I grieve at the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of him that is departed, I discover an Envy rather than Affection. If I grieve for the loss which my self sustaineth, I must take heed that I wrong not my confidence in God. I may not offend in the number of my Tears; for if I weep too much, I may forfeit my hope; or at least I may occasion those that behold me to think that I doubt of the salvation of the Dead. Weep I may, and weep I must: but for fear lest <hi>I</hi> offend in these my Tears, in my earnest Prayers I will beg that they may be sanctified.

                  <head>The Dying Knell—, Or, Tears for the Death of a beloved Brother, and may likewise serve at the Decease of any other faithful Friend.</head>
                  <p>A <hi>Friend</hi> (saith King Solomon) <hi>loveth at all times, and a Brother is born for adversity,</hi> Prov. 17. 17. Friendship which is begotten by the outward form, or any other sinister and by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respect, liveth no longer than that ground of affection: but nature is stronger than our election can be; and Religion obligeth far more than both. O how great then is my loss of my dearest Brother, in whom both excellency of Feature, nearness of blood, and a gracious conversation conspired to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to render him <hi>matchless!</hi> To me he was a Friend but now to the Grave: and what loss can be greater than the loss of a Friend? To me he was a Brother, but now to the Worms: And what loss can be more deplorable than the loss of a Brother? But to me he was yet more: he was a Friend in his Love and courtesies, a Brother by his blood, yea and an instructer, a teacher of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and goodness: And yet nor love, nor blood, nor Religion could preserve him mine. O what Sorrows do accompany all things transitory! His love could not die, but his body could: And so I am deprived of the Society of my Brother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause my Brother was subject to Corruption. But is this the adversity for which he was born, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to King <hi>Solomon?</hi> Did the Wise Man intend that a <hi>Brother is born to bring Adversity?</hi> Or rather to comfort us in the time of Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity? Had he been a cause of my least distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52526:68"/>
while he was living, he would have eased my grief by grieving himself. He would have comforted me in the time of trouble, had he lived to see my grievous mourning. But now alas I am left to lament alone; and so much the more for the want of his comfort. I now must grieve for him who was my joy: and my laments and my griefs increase the higher, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause for his sake they arise who cannot allay them. Had we lived in hatred, his death per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure might have been my Comfort. Had we loved but slightly, a tear or two I might have thought enough to pay at his Funeral. But our Love was firm, it was strong, yea strong as death; and who then can blame me if my sorrows in some measure keep pace with my love? O what tie can be so great as that of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection? What love so great as of a Brother and Sister? And yet so vain is Man, so frail are Mortals, that either our affection or our persons must have a divorce. Had my deceased Brother forgotten the tie and bond of nature, and in his life, had he turned his love into hatred; yet his fault ought not to have lessened my Love, to which both Nature and Religion did strongly oblige me. Had he loved me but coldly and faintly, as divers do; yet I ought to have warmed his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the <hi>fervency</hi> of mine. But oh, he <hi>dearly loved,</hi> he <hi>cordially</hi> affected me: and <hi>yet</hi> his <hi>love</hi> and his affection could not prolong his life.</p>
                  <p>Had my Brother and I been <hi>Idolaters</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I might have believed that that sin had slain my Brother. But as our Love was constant, so our Religion was undefiled: yea the strength of our Love was founded on the <hi>purity</hi> of our Religion; and yet he hath payed his debt to Nature. The Lord did threaten to set the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:52526:68"/>
                     <hi>against the Egyptians, and that they should fight every one against his Brother,</hi> Is. 19. 2. Those <hi>Egyptians</hi> were heathens, and Enemies to the Church; but my Brother and I were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both in the Profession and the Love of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity:</hi> and yet through our sins I fear that even <hi>we destroy each other. My sins</hi> are partly <hi>punished</hi> in his death: and his death hath given me so deep a wound, that peradventure I shall not long sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive him. Our love was so entire, that methink's I could willingly sleep with him in his Grave: for while I live, my breast is but his walking monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Such love as ours did not always possess the hearts of some as nearly allyed? which maketh me sigh to think that ever there were any which had layen successively in the self same womb, and yet did not joyn in the unity of affection.</p>
                  <p>Methinks the complaint of the Church may be part of an Elegy upon my deceased brother; for with her I may cry out, and that justly too; The good man is perished out of the earth. But neither can I say that he was a <hi>Jew</hi> in supplanting; or an enemy to the <hi>Church,</hi> lying in wait for blood. What secret <hi>Devil</hi> did guide both the tongue and the hand of <hi>Joab,</hi> when under the colour of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship he asked <hi>Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And took him by the beard with the right</hi> hand <hi>to kiss him,</hi> 2. Sam. 20. 9. and yet even at that time <hi>smote him with his sword in the fifth ribb, and shed out his bowels to the ground that he died?</hi> v. 10.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52526:69"/>
this great expence of my Tears. But he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways so good a Brother, that I could never justly charge him with the least discourtesie. O no, <hi>we took sweet Counsel together, and walked unto the House of God in company,</hi> Psal. 55. 14. I may say of him as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> spake of <hi>Hanani</hi> the Ruler of the Pallace, <hi>He was a faithful man, and feared God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove many,</hi> Neh. 7. 2. His blood was near to me; but his Soul was nearer. His person I loved, as I was prompted to it by Nature: But his inner man I more zealously affected, to which I was allured by his gracious endowments, yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Counsel, nor his <hi>society,</hi> nor his <hi>fidelity,</hi> nor his <hi>Religion</hi> could preserve him from the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a <hi>temporal death.</hi> O what would I not do to call him back again? What would I not give to have him <hi>restored to life again?</hi> But all that I can either do or give, cannot perswade his Soul to return back to its <hi>Prison.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well then, seeing that I cannot fetch him from the Grave, I will yet send up my sighs towards the place where he is blessed. This I may do without any check either of <hi>reason,</hi> or <hi>religion.</hi> It was a curse which God did inflict upon <hi>Jehojakim</hi> for his sins, <hi>That they should not lament for him, saying, Ah my Brother,</hi> Jer. 22. 17, 18.

as dear as a Mother. Why then should I not sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for the loss of such a <hi>Brother?</hi> I will grieve, I will lament when I remember the Love, and the <hi>co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I will lament him as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and <hi>say, the Beauty of Israel is dead,</hi> 2 Sam. 1 19. <hi>he was lovely and pleasant in his life,</hi> ver. 23. <hi>I am distressed for thee, my Brother; very pleasant hast thou been unto me; thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of Women,</hi> v. 26.</p>
                  <p>But what advantage to the dead are the tears of the living? Can my sighs inspire life into his bosom? Can a draught of my tears fetch him back again to life? O no: 'tis this, 'tis this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that doth heighten and increase my sorrows, even that my tears cannot recover him whom I lament. But cease, sond woman, cease thy sobbs and cryes of discontent. By the extremity of thy passion thou mayest hasten to his Grave: yet if thou murderest thy self with excessive sorrow, thy soul may be deprived of the society of his. 'Tis true indeed; 'tis most true. Little can I expect to come to heaven, if I violently force my self from the earth. Why then do I take on, as if I either suspected his happiness, or doubted of following him? What comfort can it bring to his body of earth, to have it cabined in the Grave with his dispersing ashes? The dust of both of us may mix in the vault, and yet no joy arise to our sensless ashes. If his earth was that which drew mine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, I see my fondness in the corruption of that Earth: but if his gracious soul was the object of my love, I must strive to come where that survi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52526:70"/>
To heaven he's gone, and to heaven I'll hasten: and because I will go the surest way, I will walk in those paths which faith and patience shall direct me in. I will no more disturb the peace of my mind, since that cannot help me to the company of him. Weep indeed I do; I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced unto it: 'tis the law of nature; 'tis an act of necessity; I cannot avoid it. Yet, though I weep, I will labour for content: and since my God (as I undoubtedly believe) hath been pleased to crown my brother with glory; I will beseech him to comfort me here with his grace. I will not immoderately weep, lest I injure my self: I will not weep without hope, lest I offend my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker: but that I may weep as I should, and hope as I ought, and live as I am required, I will humble my self at the feet of him to whom my brother is gone.</p>

                  <bibl>ECCLES. 7. 2.</bibl>
                  <q>It is better to go to the House of Mourning, then to the House of feasting: for that is the end of all Men, and the living will lay it to his heart.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>IT is evident, that in this Verse that I have now read to you, the Wise man speaks of such a <hi>mourning,</hi> as is occasioned by the Death of friends. And he saith of that Mourning, that <hi>it is better than to be in the House of Feasting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That he speaks of such a <hi>mourning,</hi> appears by that which followeth: First, he saith that <hi>this is the end of all men,</hi> he speaks therefore of such a <hi>mourning,</hi> as is upon the end of men, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the departure of men out of this World: And Secondly, he saith, <hi>the living will lay it to his heart:</hi> He speaks of such an end of Men, as is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to the life of Men.</p>
               <p>In a word, <hi>By the House of mourning,</hi> he mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a house wherein some one is dead, which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth occasion to the parties that dwell there, of sorrow and mourning for their departed friend. <hi>It is better to go to such a house.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By <hi>the House of feasting,</hi> he meaneth not only such a house wherein there is feasting, but also all manner of abundance: As commonly Men shew their wealth in Feasting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By the end of all men, he meaneth</hi> such an end
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:52526:71"/>
of a man as that he ceaseth to be as he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, and ceaseth to do as he did upon Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By laying to heart,</hi> he meaneth such a serious considering, and pondering, and discussing of every thing, as they may bring it to some use, may draw some Fruit, and benefit out of it to themselves.</p>
               <p>So that the sum and substance of the words is thus much; <hi>It is a better thing for a Man to be conversant about the thoughts of death, and to take hold of all occasions that may bring the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious consideration thereof into his heart, than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light himself in those worldly pleasures, and sensual delights, wherein for the most part men spend their lives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The words consist of a Proposition; And a proof or confirmation of that Proposition.</p>
               <p>The Proposition. <hi>It is better to go to the House of Mourning, than to go to the house of Feasting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Confirmation or proof of it, is double: First, Because <hi>this is the end of all Men:</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Because <hi>the living will lay it to his heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the former, he calleth the House wherein any one dies, <hi>the House of Mourning. It is better to go to the House of Mourning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where you see; <hi>That the Death of Men with whom we live, is a just occasion of Mourning</hi> to some.</p>
               <p>The holy Ghost would not have described the House wherein a man dies in this manner, if there were not some <hi>equity and justice in mourning upon such an occasion.</hi> For he speaks not here (as I conceive) only with reference, and respect to the common Custom of natural and worldly Men; but with respect to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral disposition and affection, that is in the heart
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52526:71"/>
of man, and the equity of the thing. There should be visible signs of <hi>Mourning,</hi> and there is in it a just occasion, when men are taken away by death.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Sarah</hi> died, the text saith, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham came to Mourn for</hi> Sarah, <hi>and to weep for her,</hi> Gen. 23. 2. And <hi>Esau,</hi> when he speaks of the death of his Father <hi>Isaac,</hi> he calleth the time of his death, the <hi>time of Mourning, the days of Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for my Father are at hand,</hi> Gen. 27. 41. So <hi>Joseph</hi> when his Father was dead, it is said that <hi>he mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his Father seven days,</hi> Gen. 50. 10. When <hi>Samuel</hi> was dead, all the Israelites <hi>were gathered together, and lamented him,</hi> 2 Sam. 25. 1. When <hi>Josiah</hi> was dead, there was such a great lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for him, that it became a pattern of excessive mourning; <hi>In that day there shall be a great mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the Valley of</hi> Megiddon, zach. 12. 10. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Christ when he looked upon <hi>Lazarus,</hi> he <hi>wept,</hi> because he was dead. And those <hi>Ephesians,</hi> this was it that broke their hearts, they <hi>sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed most of all for the words which St.</hi> Paul <hi>Spake, that they should see his face no more,</hi> Acts 20. 38.</p>
               <p>We come now to the proof of the point, why going to the <hi>House of Mourning,</hi> taking these occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to affect our hearts, is better <hi>than to go to the House of Feasting,</hi> than to take occasions of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting our selves in outward things. What's the reason? It is double.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>This is the end of all men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is <hi>the end of all men? The House of Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> That which he meaneth by the <hi>House of Mourning</hi> here, is th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:52526:72"/>
So that the main point, that in this place the wise man intendeth, is but thus much, I will deliver it in the very words of the Text, we need not vary from them at all.
<q>
                     <l>Death is the end of all Men.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But here it will be objected; We find some men that did not die. It is said of <hi>Enoch, that he was translated, that he should not see death,</hi> Heb. 11. 5. And of <hi>Elijah, that he went up by a whirl-wind into heaven in a chariot of fire,</hi> 2 King. 2. 11. These men did not die.</p>
               <p>To this, I answer briefly, Particular and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary examples, do not frustrate general rules: God may sometimes dispense with some particular men, and yet the rule remain firm. I say it may be so.</p>
               <p>But secondly we answer, They had that that was in stead of Death to them, some change, though they did not die after the manner of other men. So at the end of the world, it is said, <hi>that those that are alive shall be caught up and changed, in the twinkling of an eye;</hi> there shall be a sudden, and almost undiscernable, unperceivable change, which shall be to them in stead of death.</p>
               <p>But it will be objected further; There is a promise made in <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. <hi>That those that believe shall never die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I answer with that common distinction; There is a twofold death, which the Scripture cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, the <hi>first and the second death:</hi> The <hi>first death,</hi> is the death of the body, that ariseth from a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, and separation of the body from the soul; And there is a <hi>second death,</hi> that ariseth from the dis-junction, and separation of the soul from God. The <hi>first death</hi> is no death pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, the <hi>second Death</hi> is that which is truly Death: And so they shall not die. A man may have a body separated from the soul, and yet not
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52526:72"/>
his soul separated from God, nor himself from Christ. <hi>Who shall separate us from the love of God in Christ? Neither life, nor death, nor principalities, nor powers,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 8 38.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This point also is of use to us, in the death of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, to moderate the mourning of Christians for the Death of others. Why? It is <hi>the end of all men,</hi> it is that that is the common condition of all men, it should not be too grievous, nor too doleful to any man. We would not have our friends to be in another condition in their birth than others, we would not have them have more fingers, or more members than a man, and would we have them have more days? Let this serve as a brief touch upon that.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it teacheth us to make good use of our fellowship while we are together. Not only we may die, but those that are useful to us may die also, let us make good use of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, while we live therefore.</p>
               <p>It did sinite the heart of those Ephesians, that they <hi>should see the face of Paul no more;</hi> specially above the rest it grieved them, that they should see him no more; how would it have grieved them, think you, if they had always hardned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against his ministry before?</p>
               <p>Think with your selves seriously, here is such a Minister, such a Christian friend, that husband and wife, that parent and child, a time of parting will come; let us make it easie now, by making good use of one another while we live, that when friends are took away, we may have cause to thank God, that we have had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and comfort of their fellowship and society, the benefit of their graces, the fruit of their lives: and not sorrow for the want of them by death.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:52526:73"/>
                  <head>Death separates a Man from his Friends.</head>
                  <p>For alas! Death doth not only part a mans body and soul, a mans self and his wealth, but it part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a man from his friends, from all his worldly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, from all those that he took delight in upon earth: Death makes a separation between husband and wife: see it in <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> though <hi>Abraham</hi> loved <hi>Sarah</hi> dearly, yet Death parted them, <hi>Let me have a place to bury my Dead out of my sight,</hi> Gen. 23. It parteth Father and Child, how unwilling soever they be: see it in <hi>David and Absolom, Oh Absolom, my son, would God I had died for thee:</hi> and <hi>Rachel mourned for her Children, and would not be comforted, because they were not.</hi> It part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Minister and the people: see it in the case of the people of Israels lamenting the death of <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el;</hi> &amp; in the case of the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> at the parting of S. <hi>Paul, sorrowing especially when they heard they should see his face no more.</hi> It parteth those friends who were so united together in love, as if they had but one soul in two bodies; see it in the separation that was made by death, between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> that were so knit together in their love, that he bewaileth him, <hi>Woe is me for my brother Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> 2 Sam. 1. 9.</p>
                  <p>This is necessary consideration for us that live, that we may learn to know how to carry our selves towards our worldly friends, and how to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate our selves in our enjoyment of these worldly comforts. Look upon every worldly thing as a mortal, as a dying comsort. Look upon Children and friends, as dying comforts. Look upon your
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:52526:73"/>
estates, as that that hath wings, and will be gone. Look upon your bodies, that now you make so much of, as a thing that must be parted from the soul by death, and that ere long.</p>
                  <p>See what advice the Apostle giveth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 19. the time is short (saith he) therefore <hi>let those that marry, be as if they married not: and they that rejoyce, as though they rejoyced not: and they that buy, as though they possessed not: and they that use this world as not abusing it, for the fashion of this world passeth away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When thou accompaniest another to the grave, dost thou conclude thus with thy self the very next time that any death is spoken of, it may be mine? or, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> speaks to <hi>Saphira</hi> after the death of <hi>Ananias, The feet of those that have buried thy hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band are at the door, and shall carry thee out also.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again this Doctrine serves to reprove, that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful laying to heart of the death of others, that is too frequent and common in the world.</p>
                  <p>That is, first, when men with too much fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and with too great excess and <hi>distemper</hi> of <hi>affection,</hi> look upon their dead friends, as if God could never repair the loss, nor make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for that he hath done in taking of them away. <hi>Rachel mourneth, and will not be comforted. David</hi> mourneth, and will scarce be comforted, <hi>Oh Absolom, my son, my son, would God I had died for thee.</hi> What is all this but to look on friends, rather as Gods than men, as if all sufficiency were included in them only? Men look on their friends, as <hi>Micah</hi> did upon his Idol, when they had bereaved him of it, they took away all his comfort and quiet; <hi>You have taken away my Gods</hi> (saith he) <hi>and what have I more,</hi> Judg. 8. 24.</p>
                  <p>This now is an ill taking to heart the death of friends, to mourn as men without l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>pe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:52526:74"/>
Secondly, there is taking to heart, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering of the death of men, but it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous considering, and unrighteous judging of the death of others. If men see one die, it may be a violent death, then they conclude, certainly there is some appearent token of Gods judgment on such a one. If they see a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother die, with some extremity of torment, and vehement pains, certainly there is some apparent evidence of Gods wrath upon this man. If they see another in some great and violent tentation, strugling against many tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they conclude presently, certainly such are in a worser case than others. I may say to all these, as Christ said once to those that told him of the eighteen men upon whom the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in <hi>Siloe</hi> fell, think you that <hi>they were sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners above all men that dwelt in</hi> Hierusalem? <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 4. Or rather, as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, All things come alike unto all, there <hi>is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked,</hi> Eccles. 9. 2. Learn to judge righteous judgment, to judge wisely of the death of others, take heed of condemning the generation of the just.</p>
                  <p>But rather, in the last place, Make this use of the death of every one. Doth such a man die by an ordinary sickness, having his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and memory continued to the end? Doth such a man die in inward peace and comfort, with clear and evident apprehensions of Gods love, so that he can with <hi>Simeon</hi> say, <hi>Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace?</hi> Luke 2. 29. What use shouldest thou that livest make of this now? Certainly, let the sweetness of their death, make thee in love with the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52526:74"/>
of their lives. That is the only way to a happy death, to a comfortable end indeed, the leading of a fruitful and profitable life.</p>
                  <p>The main business that a man hath to do, is to make sure of himself in this life. It was the question that Saint <hi>Austin</hi> made to those that told him of a violent death that seized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one. <hi>But how did he live?</hi> (saith he.) He made no matter how he went out, but how he carried himself in the world. And truly this is the great Question, that every man should put to his soul. I must out of the world, how have I lived when I was in the world? had GOD any glory by me? had men any good by me? have I furthered my account a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the day reckoning, that I may give it up with joy.</p>

He had (as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> makes mention) a Week of Sorrows: When he saw his sweet Child, that poor Infant, still panting and striving for Death, unto which he was so soon sentenced, he could not refrain from Tears, and leave off sorrowing, as you may see by this his mournful Elegy: But as soon as the Child was dead, when it had paid that debt which we must all, and we know not how soon, being only certain in uncertainty; then he could rise from the ground, change his Cloaths, wash his Hands, and break his long Fast: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon his Servants, as soon as it did arrive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their knowledge, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. began to expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and say unto him, <hi>What thing is this that thou dost?</hi> Thou didst fast and weep for the sick Child, so long as it was alive; but now it being dead, thou canst leave off all doleful Lamentations, and rise and eat: 'Tis true, (saith he) I could not do so before, seeing it did strive so for death; but now I can, and this is my reason: <hi>For now he is dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In these words, as they distribute themselves you have these three following Circumstances, regardable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:52526:76"/>
First, A serious Consideration; <hi>But now he is dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, An acknowledgment of his own Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillity and weakness, <hi>Can I bring him back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain?</hi> And then,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, and lastly, His Confidence; <hi>I shall go to him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But now he is dead,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now of these in their order severally: And First of that serious Consideration which King <hi>David</hi> took, when that his sweet Child was dead, which every one ought to do, and that was, <hi>Why shall I fast any longer?</hi> Why shall I weep, and cry thus mournfully both day and night, seeing he is dead and gone? No, I will not do it; for if I should, it would not bring him again, it would not revive, but still add more grief unto my fable thoughts, which are too grievous and sorrowful for me a forlorn creature to endure.</p>
               <p>But now for the better adavancement of your knowledge, and the better managing of my discourse, you may with me consider these four following particulars, which (as it is most requisite and necessary) are to be treated of severally.</p>
               <p>First, The person fasting and mourning.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The person mourned for.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The manner of his Mourning: And then,</p>
               <p>Fourthly and lastly, The Reason which he gives why he doth not continue (after the death of his dear Child) any longer in that doleful condition.</p>
               <p>Now the very first in this Tragical Chorus is King <hi>David,</hi> that sweet Singer of <hi>Israel,</hi> who was so loving and tender-hearted, that he
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:52526:76"/>
could not forbear to sympathize, condole, and to have a natural compassion on all, as his own words give warrant, Psal. 35. 13. For, saith he there, <hi>As soon as I perceived that my neighbours grew sick, I could not refrain my self from mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but cloathed my self with Sackcloath, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled my soul with fasting;</hi> which are the Ensigns of Sorrow, or as some say, the Weapons of Repentance. To mourn for the Sick, is both natural, commendable, and profitable; and therefore, says the Poet.
<q>
                     <l>Est quaedam flere Voluptas:</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>That there is much pleasure in Mourning: it still disburdens the heart, by opening its sluces, and dischargeth <hi>Conchas in canales,</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterns into Conduit-pipes, which run like Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of water, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 136. And therefore, says holy <hi>David, Mine eyes gush out with rivers of water:</hi> It was an usual custom in this good King, to fast, pray, and mourn continually for all persons under affliction, whether of Mind, Body, or estate: And therefore, think you, was it possible that his merciful eyes should not be eclipsed with tears, when he took his Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well of his sweet Babe, which his eyes could never behold again, until that he himself did pass into the low Chambers of death? Seven days (like <hi>Job</hi> in his troubles) he turned and tossed himself upon the ground, still crying out most mournfully, as one utterly undone for his Son, expecting always that God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty would be favourable and gracious unto him, and grant his Son a longer life: but when he saw that he would not be treated to prolong his days upon earth, resolved fully
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:52526:77"/>
with himself to leave off his sorrowing, and to say with patient <hi>Job, The Lord giveth, and the Lord hath taken away, blessed be the Name of the Lord,</hi> Job 1. 21. The Lord gave me my Child, and now hath he taken him away from me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, therefore why should I any longer fast and mourn? why should I weep and sigh thus bitterly; yea and why should I, even I feeble Creature (whose Life is but a vapour, a very moment) lay it thus to heart, and take on thus sadly? Can I bring him back again? No, I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me. <hi>Job</hi> I say, in all his cruel troubles, could not be more patient, than this princely Prophet was here. This his serious consideration doth not only bespeak him to be religious, wise and patient; but also to be most holy. <hi>Job,</hi> although a very patient man, never could nor would do thus; but cursed even the day wherein he was born, <hi>Job</hi> 3. 3. saying. <hi>Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night wherein it was said, There is a Man-child conceived.</hi> Yet further, if that you do but look upon this princely Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and good King, in his Obsequies for his Son <hi>Absolom,</hi> you will find him no otherwise affected, than he was for this poor Infant, as it is made manifest, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 33. <hi>Oh! Absolom, Absolom</hi> (faith he there by way of <hi>Epizeuxis</hi> when that the sad tidings concerning the death of his well-beloved son had arrived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his kdowledg) <hi>I would to God that I had given up the Ghost, and died for thee; yea even for thee, my Son, Absalom, my Son, Absalom; Oh! Absalom, my Son, my Son!</hi> As soon as he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Cushi</hi> to draw near unto him, <hi>ver.</hi> 32. then, yea even then he had an Earthquake in his Soul, his faculties were all set on fire, and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:52526:77"/>
when that the sad sorrowful news was told him of his dearly beloved Sons death, then in a rage he put all out of the Room where he was, and fell upon his knees with wet-shod Eyes, still wringing his hands, and wishing heartily that God had been pleased to take him instead of his son <hi>Absalom,</hi> that precious Jewel of his. I say that <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the Faithful, could not have taken it out worse; he could not have been more sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, if that his dear Son <hi>Isaac</hi> had been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; nor our old Grandsire <hi>Adam,</hi> the Father of the Living, for his slain Son <hi>Abel,</hi> than holy <hi>David</hi> that good King of <hi>Israel</hi> did here for these <hi>two Sons</hi> of his; but especially for <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salom.</hi> 'Tis true, so long as the sweet Babe was alive, still striving and strugling in his sight daily and hourly for Death, which (like that Serpent <hi>Regulus)</hi> by no Charms can be charmed; he took on most grievously: but when he had yielded up the Ghost, when Death, Gods special Bailiff, had arrested him with a <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> then he could leave off sorrowing, and resolve fully with himself to fast no longer. So long as it was alive (saith he in the former Verse) I had hopes that God would hear my Prayer, be gracious unto me, and prolong his days here with me in this habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Orb, but now it hath pleased almighty God to take unto himself my dear Child out of this miserable world, <hi>wherefore should I fast?</hi> wherefore should I take on thus sadly, being all is in vain? No, I will not do it, I will not be guilty of such a great Offence: <hi>for now he is dead, wherefore should,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Daniel</hi> that holy Prophet was of such a tender disposition, that he wept and mourned full three weeks together,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:52526:78"/>
not suffering himself to eat any pleasant thing, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 2. <hi>Esau</hi> wept for the loss of his Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; and <hi>Joash</hi> for <hi>Elisha</hi> being ready to die. <hi>Job</hi> wept and mourn'd for such as were in sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, trouble or any other adversity, and for his own afflictions; and so did <hi>Isaiah,</hi> with the good Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> for the misery of the <hi>Israelites</hi> to come, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. <hi>Naomi</hi> wept and mourn'd most dolefully departing from her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and so did <hi>Nehemiah</hi> for <hi>Jerusalem's</hi> misery. <hi>Elisha</hi> did mourn and weep bitterly seeing the evil which <hi>Hazael</hi> should do to the <hi>Israelites</hi> Children; and so did the Women for their harmless Children slain by <hi>Herod,</hi> Luk. 23. 28. Insomuch that their cry penetrating the clouds, and knocking at Heavens gate, did enter into the ears of the Lord of Hosts.</p>
               <p>And to preceed: <hi>Abraham</hi> mourned and wept bitterly for his Wife being deceased: <hi>Abigail</hi> for <hi>Uriah</hi> her loving husband: <hi>David</hi> for <hi>Saul, Abner</hi> and <hi>Jonathan;</hi> the <hi>Egyptians</hi> for <hi>Jacob</hi> seven days; <hi>Jacob</hi> for <hi>Joseph</hi> supposing him dead; <hi>Joseph</hi> for <hi>Jacob</hi> being dead; <hi>Jeremiah</hi> for <hi>Josiah</hi> with great Lementation, and the <hi>Israelites</hi> for <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> thirty days. But holy <hi>David</hi> here (in my Text) took a better course; who (as soon as his child was departed) left off sorrowing, saying, <hi>Now he is dead, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore should I mourn? &amp;c.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> bids us <hi>weep with them that weep,</hi> Rom. 12. 15. And for the dead, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. 13. but <hi>not as others sorrow, which have no hope.</hi> We must not weep and mourn immoderately, lest with <hi>Samuel</hi> we be reproved, when he lamented overmuch for <hi>Saul:</hi> but moderately, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> that blessed Apostle did for <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> Phil. 2. 27. They mourn moderately, do nothing
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:52526:78"/>
contrary to the Word of God: For Almighty God, by whom Death is inflicted, would have the nature thereof to be such, that it should bring Tears and sorrow, not only unto them which die; but unto those also of whom they that die are beloved. Who (but a man of a sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny heart, in the mourning Troop accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his loving Neighbours deceased Son unto his Grave, dying in the Spring of his Youth, even at that Age when he was most able to comfort his dearest Friends, even her that brought him into the World, or in the Winter of her Widowhood, when she did most want him) could refrain from mourning and weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Children are walking Images of their tender Parents, even Flesh of their Flesh, and Bone of their Bone, the Wealth of the poor man, and the Honour of the Rich; it must then be one step unto Weeping Cross, when any Parents lose their Children.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> in his book concerning <hi>Naboth, ch.</hi> 5. makes mention of a Tragical Accident: How that in his time there was a poor man, in extream necessity, constrained to sell one of his Sons in perpetual Bondage, that he might hereby save the rest from a present Famine; who calling all his dear Children unto him, and beholding them as Olive Branches round about his Table, could not resolve which he might best spare; his eldest Son was the strength of his Youth, even he that called him first Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore not willing to part with him; his youngest Boy was the Nest-chick, the dearly beloved of his mother, and therefore not willing to part with him; a third most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled his Progenitors, having his Fathers Bill, and his mothers eye, therefore not willing by
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:52526:79"/>
any means to part with him; one was more loving than the rest, and another more Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent; so that the good Father in conclusion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong so many, could not afford to part with any. Nay, it is almost Death to some, to part with any of their Children, but for a Year or two, although that they go but a little way, and may return when they will: Therefore could <hi>David</hi> be thought blame-worthy, to mourn for his Child, whom he could not see till he went to him; <hi>but now he is dead,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And this brings me now unto the second thing considerable in my Text, which is the Person whom <hi>David</hi> that good King, wept and mourned for thus dolefully, and that was for his Son, an innocent Babe, who was no sooner born into this miserable World, but visited with a mortal Disease, and so cut off for the Life of <hi>Urias</hi> in his Infancy. The Life of his Son <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> was not satisfaction sufficient, nor of his dearly beloved Son <hi>Absalom,</hi> nor yet the Life of his Son <hi>Adonijah,</hi> but also this poor harmless Creature, must suffer together with them; <hi>now he is dead:</hi> It is enacted by Almighty God, in the high Court of Parliament in the Kingdom of Heaven, unto all men, that they shall once Die; and therefore says, <hi>David,</hi> Psalm 89. 48. <hi>What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? Shall he deliver his Soul from the Hand of the Grave?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two sorts of Deaths; Corporal, which is either natural or violent; or Eternal Death, which is called a Spiritual Death, or the second Death.</p>
               <p>The first (being only a Separation of the Soul from the Body, with all the evils that attend thereon) this sweet Child suffered. Death is like
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:52526:79"/>
an Archer, making man his Butt, who when he shooteth, pierceth in this manner following: In shooting over us, he wounds our Ancestors; behind us, our Servants; on our right hand, our Wives and Children; on our left hand our Friends; and in the midst our selves; so that as St. <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 27. <hi>No one can escape him:</hi> So that you may see as <hi>Job</hi> saith, man's time is appointed, his months determined, and his days (which are but few upon Earth) num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered; yea, and (as our Saviour Christ says) his very last hour is limited: He was made of the mould of the Earth, and therefore thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall he return; and as all have one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into Life, the like going out shall they have to death: <hi>Naked came we into this most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble World, and naked shall we return again.</hi> If <hi>Adam</hi> had not eaten of the forbidden Fruit, we had never known what Sin had been, and so by consequence Death; which is a thing that now cannot by any means be avoided, before that we knew what sin was, we had strong Houses: But ever since, God let's us dwell in thatch'd Cottages, and clay Walls; every Disease like a storm is ready to totter us down. In old time, men us'd to live long; but now many are thrust out of house and harbour, at less than an hours warning; yea, and even in their infancy, at their first coming into the world; as this poor innocent Child was; and not only for their own faults, for their own transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but for their Parents. In the Third of <hi>Gen.</hi> you may find mans <hi>Exodus,</hi> and that is, <hi>thou shalt die.</hi> Ever since Old <hi>Adam,</hi> our <hi>great, great, great</hi> Grandfather, neglected his Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, Death the <hi>lodge</hi> of all mens lives, comes with insensible degrees upon the sons of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:52526:80"/>
men; it's impartial hand is always destroying; no Wisdom can appease, no Policy can prevent, nor any earthly Riches redeem us from the Grave; <hi>semel aut bis morimur omnes,</hi> some once, some twice, we must all die; we have an old Statute for it, that this earthly Tabernacle must suffer corruption, and therefore the Poet sings sweetly;
<q>
                     <l>Post hominem vermis, post vermen foetor, &amp; horror;</l>
                     <l>Sic in non hominem vertitur omnis homo.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>As man came from the Earth, so thither shall he return, and become a habitation and food for Worms. If any had been exempted from the fatal and general sentence of Death, then (without all question) our most blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and Redeemer <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> had been; who (for our Sins, and for our insufferable Iniquities) suffer'd the sharpest death imaginable, even to die upon the Cross; who was equal to the Father touching his God-head: Now, seeing that this ever blessed Virgins Son, Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and harmless Lamb of God, did suffer an ignominious Death, to redeem us from Eternal Death; let not us be unwilling for our own good, to lay down our lives, and to part (without sorrow and grief) with our dearest Friend, or Relation; but rather let us take up a full resolution, when any of our Friends, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though never so near and dear unto us, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and say with <hi>David,</hi> now he is dead, now he ceaseth to breath, and now he hath taken a farewell of the Elements, wherefore should I fast? Can I bring him back again? Good Christians can with patience embrace this Life, yet in their best meditations they do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:52526:80"/>
wish for Death; they honour all that contemns it, but cannot endure, or heartily love any that is afraid of it; this makes many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally love a Souldier, and honour those tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and contemptible Regiments, that will die at the command of a Sergeant. For a Pagan there may be some motives to be in love with Life, for a Christian to be amazed at Death; I see not how he can escape this <hi>dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> that is too sensible of this Life or careless of the Life to come. If a Wife put forth her Child to Nurse, and the Nurse having kept it long enough, she taketh it home again; can the Nurse or any other have any cause to complain? so the cause stands between God, and our Souls, If God (having inspired into these mortal Bodies of ours, that which is immortal) come, and take it to himself, lest it should come to harm; can any one have any reason to Complain? As seed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unless sown in the Ground, cannot bring forth, so we until that Death come, and we be laid in the Ground cannot expect our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation and bliss with Gods Saints in his Kingdom of Glory. Death freeth the godly from the Tyranny of Satan, from Sin, from the World, from the Flesh, and from eternal Damnation, placing them with Christ for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore in Heaven, the Center of all good wishes, where instead of Earthly Bodies, they shall be cloathed with unspeakable Glory; and all this holy <hi>David</hi> was not Ignorant of, which made him (as soon as his dearly beloved Son had taken his Farewell of this inferior Orb) say, Wherefore should I fast? seeing my Child, yea, my precious Jewel, has changed his Life out of a miserable world, into a Kingdom where pleasures ineffable are to be had for
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:52526:81"/>
evermore; <hi>but now,</hi> &amp;c. And this brings me now unto the Third thing considered in my Text, which is the manner of his mourning, and that was how he spun away his time in weeping, fasting, and praying for his dear child so long as he was alive; he did not as <hi>Priamus</hi> did for his Son <hi>Hector,</hi> Fast, Weep, and Pray after his Death, or as many do now adays, only in outward shew, altering their Garments. No, his was far otherwise, it was real, true, and hearty sorrow, not countenanced in the least with a heavy look or with a solemn sigh blown from deceitful lungs. No, his was a Weeping, Watching, Mourning, and Fasting Grief; he was seques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered from all Worldly contentment, imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Body from all the pleasures of this mortal Life, ever <hi>making his bed to swim, and watering his couch with tears.</hi> He mourned as one for his only Son, eating ashes like Bread, and mingling his Drink with weeping; still weeping, wailing, and crying as <hi>one that had parted with his dear Mother,</hi> Psalm 35. 14. or as <hi>a virgin girded with sack-cloath for the husband of her youth,</hi> Joel 11. 8. Nature (being we are Members of one Body, thinking the mishap of other men to be our own, through the mutual compassion of Christ's Body) makes us desirous to live together so long as is possible; therefore was it possible for <hi>David</hi> to refrain from tears, when he took his farewel of one Child, part of his own Body? No, he could not forbear crying, until he began to consider with himself that he was dead, and that the Death of the Saints is precious in the sight of the Lord, and the day thereof better to them, than the day of their birth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being then
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52526:81"/>
(and not before, as Saint <hi>John</hi> Says, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 13.) <hi>they rest from their labour;</hi> then, yea then, and not before, he could rise, change his cloaths, wash his hands, and break his fast. Now such (I say) if they will mourn, ought to be your manner, that is, so long as your friends are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited with Sickness, they ought to sympathize, condole, and have a fellow-feeling of their Maladies, ever providing to your power, all good means for their Health, and Recovery, and for good looking to them, in the time of their weakness; yea, you must pray for them, and use all lawful and good means possible for their ease, and succour; so long as it shall please God, to continue them with you in that sorrowful condition; but then, as soon as it shall please Almighty God to call any of your Relations from you (although never so near, and dear unto you; yea, although he be the staff of your Life, and your only Joy, and Comfort) you ought to refrain from tea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:52526:82"/>
the manner of <hi>David's</hi> Mourning for his Son; wherefore that which shall have the next place in my discourse, is concerning the reason this Princely Prophet, and good King gave, why he would not continue any longer in his sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful condition, and that is, <hi>Can I bring him back again?</hi> can I revive him? can I put life into him? No, it is beyond my Skill, to add one Moment to any mans life, I can neither call him back, nor go to him my self, now he is dead, and gone, all the world cannot save him alive, <hi>I must follow him, but he shall not return to me.</hi> Here you may see an acknowledgment of his own imbecillity, &amp; weakness in recovering his dead Child, can I bring him back again? It hath been experienced, and found possible for a man, from the ashes of a Plant, to revive the Plant, and from its cinder to recall it to its stalk, and leaves again, but to call those that are ascended up to Heaven, or descended into the world of Damned Souls, is far beyond the power of Man; <hi>Abraham</hi> being full of faith as it is Evident, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 19. having commanded that his son <hi>Isaac</hi> should be offered, thought that God would raise him up again from the dead: therefore, why did not <hi>David</hi> hope the same, the reason, as <hi>Peter</hi> observes, upon this place in my Text, is diverse. <hi>Abraham</hi> had the promise concerning his Son <hi>Isaac,</hi> he knew that God would do whatsoever he desired, rather than his promise should not be fulfilled, therefore he came with a willing mind unto that offering: but <hi>David</hi> had not such promises concerning this his dearly beloved Son, but rather a threatning, seeing he was ready to die, or just newly dead; wherefore being not encouraged in the least (his own Conscience telling him, how it was Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,

               <p>THis is the conclusion of all Flesh; they were never so dear before, but they come to be as loathsom and intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble now. When once the Lines and Picture of Death is drawn over the Fabrick of Man or Woman's Body, (as it is said here of <hi>Sarah)</hi> all their Glory ceaseth, all their good Respect va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth away, their best Friends would be fainest rid of them: even <hi>Sarah</hi> that was so goodly and amiable in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s sight, must now out of his sight, he must <hi>bury his dead out of his sight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Abraham,</hi> as the Father of faithful men, and a Pattern to all loving Husbands in all Ages ensuing, doth not this till such time as the dead <hi>Sarah</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth noysom to all that look upon her. As long as he could by his Mourning and Lamentation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute her without offence to his Eyes, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to his Health, he did it: but now the time is
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:52526:85"/>
come, when Earth must be put to Earth, and Dust must return to Dust. There is no place for the fairest Beauty above Ground, when once God hath taken Life and Breath from it; it must go to its own Elements, and to the Rock and Pit from whence it was hewen, thither it must return.</p>
               <p>After he had performed this, perhaps he mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed three or four Days for his Wife; he knew this Mourning must have an end, he knew that he must commit her to the Ground. Therefore when he had thus moderated himself, as first to shew by his Sorrow that he was a loving Husband, and then to shew in the ceasing of his Sorrow that he was a wise man, and a faithful Christian, He cometh to desire a possession of burial.

               </p>
               <p>Here is the end why he would have this <hi>Possession.</hi> A strange kind of <hi>Possession.</hi>

               <p>Behold <hi>Abraham;</hi> see how he beginneth to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess the World, by no Land, Pasture, or carable Lordship: <hi>The first thing is a Grave.</hi> So every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian must make his Resolution.

               <p>There are but Three things appertaining to Man here.</p>

                  <item>1. <hi>Man goeth,</hi> there is his Life.</item>

                  <item>3. <hi>And the Mourners go about the Streets,</hi> there is his Burial described by Pariphrasis.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And so I am upon the first Stage.</p>
               <p>The Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Man's Life is a Voyage, his Death the term o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> period of this Voyage, his Grave his home, and Mourners his Attendance. The Hour-Glass is run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, whether the Preacher proceeds, or makes a pawse, and the Ship is sayling whither it is bound, when we sleep in our Cabbine; so whether we wake or sleep, move or rest, be busie or idle, mind it, or mind it not, we walk on toward our long home.</p>
               <p>We are expiring and dying, from the running of the first Sand in the Hour-glass of our life, to the last, from the moment we receive Breath, to the moment that we breath out our last gasp.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Man</hi> in my Text goeth, or rather run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth still in his natural Course, that is, every<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:52526:89"/>
I need not direct any Man in his Natural Course from Life to Death, every Man knows it, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he knowes it or no, he shall accomplish it, the Spiritual Course is more considerable, which is <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerarium ad Deum,</hi> a Journal to Eternity, a Progress from Earth to Heaven; this Progress a Man begins at his Regeneration, and in part endeth in his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution by Death, but wholly and fully after his Resurrection; the way here is Christ; the <hi>viati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi> the blessed Sacraments; the light the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; the guides the Ministers of the Word; the Thieves that lie in wait to rob us of our Spiritual Treasure the Divels; our convoy the Angels; our stages several vertues and degrees of Perfection, the City to which we bend our course, <hi>Jerusalem that is above,</hi> wherein are many Mansions, or eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal houses,</p>
               <p>I am now come, though long first, to Man's long home, which cannot be described in a short time, and therefore I leap into my last stage, which as you may remember was:
<q>
                     <l>The Application of the Text to this sad Occasion.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I must now use in the Application of my Text, a method direct contrary to that which I followed in my Explication; for therein first I shewed you how the natural Man goeth to his long, and the Spiritual to his eternal home; and after how, and why, and what sort of Mourners went about the Streets lamenting the deceased; but now I am to speak of the Mourners, who have already finished their circular motion, and then of the direct mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Man, the man of quality, the man of worth, the Man of estate and credit, who is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy arrived at his <hi>long Lete,</hi> and now entring into his long home.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:52526:89"/>
Touching the Mourners I cannot but take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their number and quality; the number is great we see, yet we see not all who yet are the truest Mourners, pouring out their Souls to God with tears in their private Closets.
<q>

               <p>Her portion of sorrow like <hi>Benjamins,</hi> is five times more than any others, whose loss of a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and such a Husband is invaluable. Secondly the quality of the Mourners is not slightly to be passed by, <hi>debeter iis religiosa mora;</hi> for, not only great store of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Let them who have lived in credit die in honour; let them who in their life time did many good Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to the dead, after they are dead receive the like Offices from the living.

In sum, he was a most provident Housholder, loving Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, indulgent Father, kind Landlord, and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Patron.</p>

But as the Mother when the Bee hath stung her Childs Finger, runs with all haste to get a little Dirt, and claps it to her little One, which doth asswage the Swelling, and give it ease: So those busie Bees of Hell daily stinging us, and striking into our Breasts the Poyson of their Pride and Arrogancy, Almighty God with a <hi>Memorandum</hi> of Death, with a <hi>Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return,</hi> abates this Pride, and tells us of that swelling Arrogancy of ours.

the King of <hi>Tyre</hi> said, <hi>I am a God,</hi> but he was answered, <hi>that he was but a man,</hi> that is, base, vile and miserable: So holy <hi>David</hi> said, <hi>Let the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions know that they are but men;</hi> that is, base and vile: and St. <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>Are ye not men?</hi> 1 Cor. 3. When we see a man swallowed up sometimes in the misery of the Body, and sometimes of the Soul, we say in the conclusion, he is a Man. Now if instead of the Gold of the Angels, there was found Rust, and that so fine Cloath as that was not without its Moths, and that incorrupted Wood without its Worm; what will become of those that are but Dust, who dwell in Houses of Clay? Verily they must (as fearful of their own harm) repeat this Lesson, <hi>Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return</hi> One asking the question, Why God (having Created the Soul for Heaven) did knit it with so straight a Knot to a Body of Earth, so frail, and so lumpish? Whose answer was, That the Angels being overthrown by their Pride, He was willing to repair and to help this Presumption in Man, a Creature in his superiour part as it were Angelical, but having a heavy and miserable Body; which might serve as a Stay unto him, that if the nimbleness of his Understanding should puff him up, yet that Earth which Clogged his Body should humble and keep him down. Those that entred Triumphantly into <hi>Rome,</hi> had a thousand occasions given them to incite them to Pride, Arrogancy and Vanity: As their great number of Captives, their Troops of Horse, their Chariots drawn with Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants or Lions, and their Ladies looking upon them from their Windows, and the like: But the Senate considering the great danger of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umpher, ordered one to sit by his Side, to whisper this still in his Ear <hi>Remember thy self to be a Man.</hi> The Princes of the Earth have many Motives to

make them forget themselves, not regarding the Complaints of the Poor and Needy; yet as the Wise Man saith, <hi>Wisdom</hi> 7. 5. No King had ever any other beginning of Birth, they are as other Men, the Off-spring of the Earth, and the Children of Men, and to them it is also said, <hi>Dust thou art, &amp;c.</hi> But to proceed,</p>
               <p>As Man is Dust and Earth by Procreation, so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he is Dust and Earth by Sustentation, and that in two respects; In regard of Aliment and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Meat and Apparel: It is truly said, That of which we consist, we are nourished with; Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are Aliments, where we begin, we do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; all Meats for our Bodies in Health, and all Medicines for the same, being Sick, are Earth and Earthy, even Dust and Ashes as we our selves are; we feed on the Things of the Earth, and walk and sleep thereon: As for Apparel and Ornaments, we borrow Wooll of the Sheep, Hair of the Camel, Silk of the Worm, Furies of the Beasts, and Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Fowls of the Air; like unto <hi>Aesop</hi>'s Crow, having some Plume from every Bird, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from every Creature. Flowers are richly decked, Plants with an infinite variety of coloured Leaves adorned, and other Animals as well Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative as Sensitive, comely covered; only Man, that unhappy and base Creature, is born to nothing but Beggery and Misery: So that we may justly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim and cry out with the good Prophet <hi>David,</hi> saying, <hi>What is Man, &amp;c.</hi> Nay, what are we? If that the good Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> who was Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Mothers Womb, did bewail his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what may we do who are Born in Sin, and Conceived in Iniquity, being Formed of most base and unclean Matter? God Created Stars and Planets out of Fire, Birds out of Air, Fish out of Water, but Man with other Animals out of the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:52526:94"/>
Slime of the Earth; therefore remember and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, O Mrn! what thou art, and thou shalt find thy self much worse than any other Creature what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever besides, even Dust and Ashes. Now from this Principle I will infer three or four Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of very great Fruit and Consequence.</p>
               <p>The First is this, If thou art Dust and Ashes, wherefore art thou proud, thou Dust and Ashes? Of thy Beginning? No; of thy End? No; Of what then? If thou shouldest see thy self Seated between the Horns of the Moon, think on the baseness of thy beginning, and thou shalt then see clearly that Pride was not born for Man, nor An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Pettishness appointed for Woman's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; Pride cannot sute with Dirt, nor Curst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness with Woman's Softness. <hi>Lord cleanse me from my secret sins, and spare thy Servant from those that are strangers:</hi> By Aliens you may understand those of Pride, for it is a Stranger as it were, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other kind of thing, differing much from Man's base and vile Condition. There is not any Sin more alien and strange to Man's Condition than Pride, or that doth carry with it less excuse. Those Fools that are Painted forth, going about to build a Tower that should overtop the Clouds, and reach to Heaven. <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 4. did in their very first word say, <hi>Come let us make us Bricks;</hi> Bewraying their Foolishness: What? go about upon Earth to rear a Foundation that should emulate Heaven, which is far beyond Thought, and glorious beyond Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port! God Almighty said unto <hi>Ezekiel, Take thou a Tile, and pourtray upon it the City of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>the Walls, the Ditches, the Towers, the Temple, and a great Army of Men,</hi> Ezek. 4. 1. Strange, yet true we see it is, that the Strength of Cities, the Power of Armies, is contained in a poor brittle Tile-stone. The good Prophet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And this is the reason why the Church, though she might use other Metaphors to express the Misery and shortness of Mans Life, as is often made mention of in the Ornament of Grace, as by a Leaf, a Flower, and a Shadow; yet it makes more particular choice of Dust and Ashes, because the other are Metaphorical, these Literal. for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more properly appertaineth unto Man than Dust, and therefore the Scripture termeth Death, a Mans returning again unto the Earth from whence he came. The Flower, the Leaf and the Fruit, have some good in them, though of short conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance; as Colour, Odour, Beauty, Vertue and Shade, and albeit not good in themselves, yet they are the Image and Representation of Good; but Dust and Ashes speak no other good. Amongst the Elements, the Earth is the least noble, and the most weak, the Fire, the Water and the Air, have in them Spirit and Actitude; but the base Element Earth, as it were a Prisoner laden with Weightiness. A certain Poet styles the Earth <hi>Bruta,</hi> not only for that it hath an unpleasant
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:52526:95"/>
Countenance, as Deserts, Quick-sands, Dens, and Caves; but also for that it is an Inne of Serpents, Tygers, Panthers, and the like, so that it is good neither to the Taste, to the Smell, to the Feeling, nor to the Hearing, nor yet to the Seeing. Thou being therefore Earth, why art thou Proud, thou Dust and Ashes? And thus far of the First.</p>
               <p>Now the Second Thing regardable, is, If thou art Ashes, why <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>uch a deal of Care in Pampering thy Body, which the hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>gry Worms are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to morrow? Consider those rotting and stinking Carkasses of your Relations, that lye here under the Ground, and the very thought thereof will moderate your desire of being over-dainty and curious in cherishing your own. <hi>Isaac</hi> on the Night of his Nuptials, placed his Wifes Bed in the Chamber where his Mother died. <hi>Tobias</hi> spent all the Night with his Spouse in Prayer, being mindful of the harm which the Devil had done to her former Husbands; as being advised from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that he should temper with the remembrance of Death, the Delights and Pleasures of this short Life of ours. The Camomile, the worse you treat it, and the more you tread upon it, the better it thrives; other Plants require Pruning and tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make them fruitful; but this Herb hath a quite contrary condition, that with ill usage it grows the better. It is the pamper'd Flesh that brings forth Thistles and Thorns, but the Flesh that is trodden down and humbled, that yields store of Fruit: And this is likewise concerning the Second.</p>
               <p>Now the Third thing to be considered, is, If thou art Dust, and to Morrow must become Dust and Ashes, why such a deal of coveting of Honours and Riches, which on a sudden may take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Wings and flye away. <hi>Esau</hi> sold his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right

for a Mess of Pottage, but he excused his so doing, for that he saw his Death was so near at hand: <hi>Behold I am ready to die what will this Birth-right profit me?</hi> But to be brief, as Man in respect of his beginning and proceeding, is Earth, even so he is Dust and Ashes in r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

A living Dog is better than a dead Lion; every <hi>Thersites</hi> will Insult over <hi>Hector,</hi> and every Scrub run upon <hi>Achilles.</hi> Every Child is ready to mangle the strong Oak when it is down, and he that durst not look <hi>Caesar</hi> in the Face, is now bold to pull him by the Beard. Our Bodies are not only Houses of Clay, <hi>Job</hi> 4. 19. but as they be earthly, so Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. Set up this Day, and happily taken down the next: And therefore the Years of Man are termed Days in holy Scripture, as the <hi>Daies of</hi> Noah, <hi>the Daies of</hi> Lot, and the <hi>Daies of</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias, because they lived but a few Days; as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch <hi>Abraham, Few and evil have been the Daies of my Pilgrimage,</hi> Gen, 47. 9. Although time may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into past, prrsent and future, yet there is no time belonging essentially to our Life, but even the very Now, because the time past is certainly gone, and the future time uncertainly to come; and

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I say unto you, as the good Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> did unto them of old, <hi>O Earth! Earth!

wast in thy beginning a most miserable Wretch, yea a filthy stinking Worm, Conceived and Born in Sin; thou art now a Sackful of Dirt, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after thou shalt be nothing but a Bait and Banquet for Worms.

Remember I pray you from whence you came, and Blush; where you are, and Lament; and whither you must in spite of your Teeth, and Tremble. Brag not of any thing in you, or on you; neither what you have been, are, or may be: for in respect of your base, weak and frail Flesh, you are a Clod of Earth, are so still, and in the end shall become no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but a Coffin of Earth under ground. Thy Grave shall be thy House, and thou shalt make thy Bed in the Dark. Thou shalt say to <hi>Corruption, thou art my Father, and to the Worm, thou art my Mother and Sister.</hi> Our Flesh dissolveth into Filthiness, Filthiness into Worms, and Worms into dust; so our Flesh which is Dust, thar is nothing, returns into nothing, that is Dust at last.</p>
               <p>And thus I have shewed you at large, how we are said to be Dust, and likewise how we shall at last return thither again.</p>
               <p>Wherefore now (to be brief) to put a Period to all, Remember what you are, and Meditate Daily and Hourly upon what you shall be, lest that Death (like a Thief) steal upon you, as it doth upon many now-a-days: For Meditation is like Gunpowder, which in a Mans hand is Dust and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:52526:97"/>
Earth, but if you put Fire thereunto, it will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw Towers, Walls, and whole Cities. A light Remembrance, and a short Meditation of what you are, is like that Dust which the wind scattereth away; but a quick lively Memory, and enflamed Considerations of your own wretched Estates, will blow up the Towers of your Pride, cast down the Walls of your Rebellious Nature, and ruine those Cities of Clay wherein you live. As the Phoenix Fannowing a Fire with her Wings, is renewed again by her own Ashes; so shall you become new kind of Creatures, by remembring what you have been, are, and what you shall be; that you are but Dust, and shall return unto Dust again. <hi>Moses</hi> casting Ashes into the Air, made the I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Ashes scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by <hi>David,</hi> put the King out of doubt, and made it appear unto him, that that was no God which he adored: <hi>Job</hi> came forth from his Ashes in better Estate than he was before: And as <hi>Joseph</hi> came out of Prison from his torn and fattered Rags, and had richer Robes put upon him, so you from out of these your Ashes, shall be stript of the Old Man, and put on the New. The forgetfulness of other things may be good sometimes, but of your selves, what you are, and shall be, never. This will require a continual Remembrance, therefore this cannot be to often inculcated, <hi>Dust thou art, and unto Dust thou shalt return.</hi>

               <p>IAm now about to speak of that which will shortly render me unable to speak; and you are now about to hear of that which will also shortly make you uncapable of hearing any more, and that is <hi>Death.</hi> It will be but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while before <hi>Death</hi> will cause both the Speaker to be Dumb, and the Hearer to be Deaf. Oh that I might therefore this day, speak with that serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness unto you, as considering the time draws on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace, when I shall be Silenced by <hi>Death,</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more have an opportunity to speak one word unto you. And Oh! that you might Hear this day with that diligence and reverence, as consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that after you are once <hi>Nailed down in your Cossins, and Covered with the Dust,</hi> you will never hear one Sermon more, or one Exhortation, or one word more, till you hear these words pronounced by the great Judge of the Quick and Dead, <hi>Surgite Mortui, &amp; venite ad Judicium;</hi> Arise ye Dead, and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:52526:99"/>
come ye unto Judgment. What is said in my Text, as it is likely you have often heard it with your Ears, so now you may see it accomplished, <hi>It is appointed unto all Men once to die. Death</hi> hath long since come into our Nation, and hath summoned many to make their appearance in another World, yea, you know that <hi>Death</hi> hath already entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Streets, and hath not been afraid to step o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our <hi>Threshold,</hi> and to seize upon those that have been standing round about us; yea, it hath come into our very <hi>Bed-chambers,,</hi> and hath suddenly snatched away those that have been lying in our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Bosoms: So that we have had warning enough of the near approaches of <hi>Death</hi> unto our selves, and without doubt some of us have had the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Death</hi> within our selves, (as the Apostle speaketh;) and therefore it is high time for you and I seriously to consider what is said in my Text, <hi>Set thy House in order,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Something we shall briefly speak now in order to the explanation of the words, that so you may once more hear (before you feel) the meaning of them; It is <hi>appointed</hi> or <hi>enacted</hi> by the Court of Heaven; <hi>Statutum est,</hi> it is a Statute or Law (more firm and certain than the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians)</hi> which is never to be repealed or abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated. We are not therefore telling you what may, but of what must inevitably come to pass. It is appointed <hi>unto Men,</hi> that is as much as to say, unto all Men, <hi>once to die.</hi> It is an indefinite Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, and so is to be understood of all the same kind, without some special exception from this general Rule. And indeed such an exception there is to be found in the Scripture; for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, <hi>We shall not all Die, but some shall be Changed, in a Moment, in the twinkling of an Eye;</hi> there shall be some at the end of the World, who shall not
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:52526:100"/>
pass under <hi>Death, but yet they must pass under a Change,</hi> which is thought will be equivalent unto <hi>Death.</hi> But for the present time, and according to the common Method and Course of Providence, no Man or Woman hath any ground to expect that they shall escape the stroke of <hi>Death;</hi> for it is <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto Men,</hi> that is, unto <hi>all Men, once to Die: Death</hi> will no more spare him that wears a <hi>Crown</hi> upon his Head, than him that carries a <hi>Spade</hi> in his Hand, as the <hi>Poet</hi> Elegantly expresses it.
<q>
                     <l>Pallida Mors aequo pulsat pede</l>
                     <l>Pauperum tabernas, Regumque Turres, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And the Scripture speaking of <hi>Kings,</hi> useth this Expression, <hi>I have said ye are Gods, but ye shall die like Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what is the meaning of the Phrase <hi>to Die?</hi> I can assure you if you know not yet, it will not be long e're you will know the meaning of it: The Philosopher describes Death thus, <hi>Est privatio Vitae, ob Animae separ ationem a Corpore:</hi> As <hi>Spiritual Death</hi> is the Separation of God from the Soul, so <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Death</hi> is the Separation of the Soul from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; When those two (the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body)</hi> which have like Twins, dweltlovingly together under the same Roof, must be parted asunder, and enjoy no more sweet and intimate Communion one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, till the time of re-unition at the <hi>General Resurrection.</hi> This is that which must <hi>once</hi> be done, every one must here take their turn.</p>
               <p>And though this happeneth to some at one time, and to others at another time, yet first or last, it will happen to all. The Greek word <hi>(Thanatos)</hi> which signifies Death, is taken from a word which signifies <hi>extendere,</hi> and indeed Death stretcheth out it self so far, that no Man can live out of the reach
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:52526:100"/>
of it. As surely as thou wast once Born, so surely shalt thou once Die.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let me but ask you this one plain Question, and your own Conscience shall be the Judge in the Case: Couldest thou still remain a Drunkard or a Swearer, if thou didst but once seriously consider that thou must once Die? Or couldst thou so eagerly set thy Heart upon the empty, lying and dying Vanities of this World, didst thou bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> once seriously consider that thou must once, (and it may be before to Morrow) be taken out of this World?</hi> Or couldst thou neglect the means of Grace or Delight in Prophaneness, didst thou but seriously consider that thou must once die, and it may be before ever thou enjoyest another Praying or Preaching oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity? <hi>To die</hi> is much, and as this must be once done, so there is more to be done than this, for <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this</hi> cometh <hi>Judgment.</hi> Whether the particular or general Day of <hi>Judgment</hi> is here to be understood, needs no debate, seeing both will certainly follow after <hi>Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the certainty of <hi>Death,</hi> you need not look into your <hi>Bibles</hi> for a proof of that; I shall only desire you to open your <hi>Weeping Eyes,</hi> and let them but a little while be fastened upon the <hi>Dead Corps</hi> that now is before you, and if afterwards you can question this Truth, I shall say no more to you at present, but that it will not be long e're others may say of thee, as the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> did to <hi>Saphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> Acts 5. verse 5, 6, 7, compared with the 9 and 10. Verses. <hi>And</hi> Ananias <hi>fell down and gave up the Ghost; and the young Men arose, wound him up, and carried him out and buried him: And his Wife not knowing what was done, came in; and</hi> Peter <hi>said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, How is it that ye have agreed to tempt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord?

And then as for the certainty of <hi>Judgment,</hi> though every one hath a sufficient Proof in his own Conscience of the truth of this, yet for as much as some have seared Consciences, and therefore would put off the Evil Day, and say with those, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3, 4. <hi>And there will come in the last days Scoffers, walking after their own Lusts, saying, Where is the Promise of his Coming? since all things continue as they were from the beginning,</hi> &amp;c. You may therefore Consult these plain Scripture Proofs, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11. 9. compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 11, 12. <hi>For we shall all stand before the Judgment-Seat of Christ,</hi> yet that is not all, but as it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>So then every one of us shall give account of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to God.</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 10. <hi>For we must all appear before the Judgment-Seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in the Body, according to that he hath doae, whether it be good or bad.</hi>

Now by this word <hi>House,</hi> you may understand, even every Humane Body, which although at its first Creation, was a most solid, sound, and incorruptible Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; yet, by the entrance in of sin became ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of all sorts of Maladies; 'tis true, before that we knew what a damnable thing sin was, we had strong Houses, but ever since God Almighty lets us dwell in Paper thatched Cottages, and clay Walls, every Disease like a tempestuous storm totters us, and is ever and anon ready to overwhelm us. Now this ruinous House, and all decaying Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, which by the corruption of sin is become as a Pest-house, fetide, filthy, and unclean, before it can be set in order, must be swept clean and throughly rinced of all sins infective dregs.</p>

                     </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth with the Water, the Water fighteth with the Fire, the most filly Worm doth contend with the most strong Man to preserve it self, and therefore we are not to butcher our Neighbours, or our selves, but to expect Gods pleasure, and leisure to let us depart in peace, seeing that <hi>we must all die, and not live.</hi> That bloody Tyrant <hi>Nero</hi> had his hands so stained with the guilt of innocent blood, that when God saw that he would not repent, <hi>and set his House in order,</hi> caused him to die both a sudden and a shameful Death, and thus God dealt with many more, whom I shall leave to your considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherefore that you may not taste of the same sauce, while it is said, <hi>to day, set your House in order,</hi> get them throughly cleansed from all guilt, and especially from the guilt of Blood, and then, when you die you shall receive incorruptible Crowns, you shall be like Kings and Princes, all Co-heirs in the Kingdom of Heaven, which for excellency is far beyond thought, and glorious beyond report.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As the Body, before it can be set in Order, must be throughly cleansed from the guilt of blood; so must it likewise be purged throughout, and scoured well of all the Pollutions, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptive Dregs, which Adultery leaves behind it, they are not a few, it is a Quotidian Fever to the Corps, a Canker to the Mind, a Corrosive to the Conscience, and a mortal Bone to all the Body. It is an efficient cause of more cruel Maladies in the Body than any thing beside.</p>
                  <p>First, it sets the Body on fire, which ever after consumes away by an incurable Consumption.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:52526:105"/>
Secondly, it brings the Body into a Dropsie, which by no skilful Physitian with all his cunning Medicines, and drawing Issues can be once cured; till that Tyrant, and all-devouring Death come with its sharp stinging Arrows, and execute its of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Concupiscence is like a fire, and our Bodies unto seething pots which cannot be cooled, but either by taking away the fuel, by keeping it in continual motion, by casting in of cold water, or lastly, by taking it altogether from the fire. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let every man in the fear of God, use these means prescribed for the cooling of intemperate Lust boiling in his flesh.</p>
                  <p>First, I say, let him take away the fuel, let him refrain himself from eating, and drinking too much, lest at last Lust command like a Tyrant; for saturity is the father of wantonness, and uncleanness, the Daughter of surfeiting, <hi>sine</hi> Cerere <hi>&amp; Libero friget</hi> Venus, <hi>without Nectar and Ambrosia</hi> Concupiscence cannot long continue, for Lady <hi>Venus</hi> dwells still at the sign of the Ivy-bush: where there is clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Teeth, usually there is no filthiness of Body, but if that we stuff our Corps as full as they can hold, making our mouths as Tunnels, our throats as Wine-pipes, and our bellies as barrels, we must expect nothing but Lust ever to Tyranize over us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let every one keep his Body in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Action, for Concupiscence is begot of an idle Brain, and hatch'd in a lazy Body.

                     <hi>Egistus</hi> complaining why he should be made an Adulterer, was quickly answered, because he was idle. The Crab-fish being more subtle than many

other Fishes against the coming of the Flood, when that the Oyster never fails to open, flings into her a little Stone, that she cannot shut her self again, and so the Oyster is devoured by the Crab; our Adversary the Devil is like unto the Crab; and we just like the Oyster, if that he find us idle and gaping, he takes his opportunity to confound us. Idleness is the Devils Pillow, saith <hi>Origen,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore like a pestiferous and dangerous Plague is to be shun of all: <hi>Cupid</hi> shoots still in a slug, and therefore hits none, but such as are sluggish.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Let every Man stir to cool his Body by washing of himself throughly with his Tears, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did, who <hi>watered his Couch with his Tears,</hi> and <hi>whose Eyes became a Fountain of Tears. David</hi> and his people lifted up their Voices, and wept so long that they could weep no longer.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, As the Pot is cooled by taking it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether from the Fire; so indeed may the Lust of the Body, by shuning opportunities and occasions of Sin, for Liberty makes Thieves. <hi>Daniel,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though but a young Man, was so indued with the Continency, that he did not only all he could to suppress Lust in himself, but also reproved the Las<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civious Elders, <hi>Joseph</hi> a young Man resisted the Temptations of his own Mistress, and likewise St. <hi>John</hi> the Blessed Evangelist, although very young, almost a Boy, did what as in him lay to bridle his Nature, and to keep his House in order: Now see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that filthy Lust doth not only dishonour, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so pollutes our Vessels, our Clay Bodies, let us take Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s advice, which is <hi>to abstain from its eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind,</hi> for although it doth seem a Paradise to the Desire, yet it is a Purgatory to the Purse, a Plague to the Body, and a Hell to the Soul; and that which may stir up the Wanton the most, a Sin against his own Body; Dost thou then love thy

Flesh? Abstain from Adultery, for it is rottenness to thy Bones; Dost thou thy Soul? Abstain then from it. Lord, for it is very unhonest; Or dost thou love thy Credit? Be sure then likewise that thou abstain from it, for it is very dishourable. This heat is an Infernal Fire, whose Fuel is Fulness of Bread. and abundance of Idleness; Evil Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications are the Sparks, Infamy the Smoak, Pollution the Ashes; and the End Hell, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seeing this, get your selves throughly cleansed from this Infectious Disease, and suffer not Sin to raign in your Mortal Bodies, but with all haste, <hi>set your House in order, for you shall die.</hi> As the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy before it can <hi>be set in order,</hi> must first be purg'd of all Blood-guiltiness, and then of all those Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers occasioned by Adultery, so must it likewise be Scoured from top to toe of all Pride and Arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which are the other proper Sins of Satan; they that are proud, and vain-glorious, must of necessity be ever Factious; seeing that bravery ever stands upon comparisons; and likewise very violent, ever to make good their own vaunts; they are seldom or never at love with their Neighbours, it's true, one Tradesman will love another, and one Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, according to <hi>Horace,</hi> will take Delight in the Company of another, sitting Hour after Hour, drinking of Soul-sick Healths; but for one proud Man to associate with another, and to love him as himself, is a thing seldom or never seen; just like the Foolish <hi>Jea</hi> cloath'd with the <hi>Peacock</hi>'s Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he ever thinks himself Chief among all, though according to Natures Ordination a meer <hi>Ignoramus;</hi> he is ever casting beyond the Moon, till that he bring himself to destruction, which may well be so according to that of <hi>Solomon, Pride go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before destruction, and a haughty mind before a fall,</hi> Prov. 16. 18. The good Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> had
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:52526:106"/>
such an invettered hatred against the Sin of Pride, that he pronounced a woe against <hi>Ephrin</hi> the very Crown of all Arrogancy; saying, <hi>Woe unto the Crown of Pride,</hi> Isa. 28. 1. for it shall bring a Man very low, when humility shall raise him full high, as you may see by the words of the ever blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> who saith, <hi>Luke</hi> the 1. 52. that the <hi>Lord hath put down the Mighty from their Seat, and hath exalted the Humble and Meek.</hi> This Sin corrupts the whole World, therefore that you may get your selves free from all its Infections, fly it as you would the Plague or Pestilence, and with all haste <hi>set your House in Order, for you shall die, and not live.</hi> 4. The next Malady that you must get your selves Cured of before that your Houses can be set in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is Envy, Hatred, and Malice, a Sin which hath been of too long standing: It was very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in <hi>Hesiod</hi>'s time, and not only among the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Singers; but also among the very Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants, whereupon he took occasion to say, One Potter (saith he) there envies another, one Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hates another, and one Beggar pronounceth a woe against another? A Man that hath no Virtue in himself ever is envying Virtue in another, and not in those that are far distant, but even in those that are full near, and dear unto him;—<hi>feriunt sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos Fulmina montes;</hi> as high Hills are most exposed to Thunder, and as the fairest Flowers are the soonest nipt by the venemous <hi>Cantharides;</hi> even so the most Eminent Gifts and Graces in Men, are the greatest griefs of the Malicious and Envious Misers, this Sin is a repining grief for other Mens Happiness; it is an evil Eye which wisheth good to no Man, but to it self; although the Squint-Eye, Male content and Envious Wretch doth thus ever Travel with Mischief, and bring forth ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, still disquiering of himself like the raging
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:52526:107"/>
Sea, and stiring up strife all the day long; yet let him remember that this course of Life must be alter'd, that he must get his Body throughly drench'd from all <hi>Envy, Hatred,</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi> (the greatest Antagonist against Love, which ought to be embraced for all) and <hi>Get his House set in order, for he shall die and not live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The Body must first be purged from the Corruptions of Blood-guiltiness. Secondly, from the cruel Maladies occasioned by Adultery. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of all putrifactions brought in by Pride and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancy, and fourthly, the infections procured by <hi>Envy, Hatred,</hi> and <hi>Malice;</hi> so likewise it must be ever kept free from all Covetous, and greedy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, the root of all ill, and the very <hi>Metropolis</hi> of all Villany. <hi>Judas</hi> was not sooner made Buyer, but that he shut himself into his Purse, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Slave to a few pieces of Silver his own Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, so that indeed at last it was more easie for a Camel to enter into the Eye of a Needle, than for him being conjured into the Circle of his Purse to get out again. This Sin is so sweet that it leadeth almost all Men unto Destruction, whom it once possesseth; What was it but only Covetousness that brought <hi>Dives</hi> to the Pit of Hell, where being ever tormented with its Scorching Flames is still dying, yet never dead, always crying out, O Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Death, O deadly Life, what shall I term thee, for if that thou be Life, wherefore dost thou kill? and if Death, how dost thou still endure; for in Life there is some ease and comfort, and in Death an end; but in thee there is neither ease, nor end. O my dear and well beloved Friends, consider this; and get your selves Cured of this Malady, which of it self is able to bring a Man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Pit of Hell, fly it as a secret Enemy in your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Fifthly, the Drunkard breaketh the Eighth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment as well as the rest; for although, like a cunning Fox he may refrain to take up at home, yet if it be to be had abroad, he is sure to have it; but indeed, that which is the worst of all is that he robs God of his due, which is of his poor Soul, which he hath purchased with his most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Blood; and so brings both his Body and Soul to utter ruin and destruction. (O thou that spins away thy time, like a Swine in drinking, and eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;) ever have this in remembrance, and <hi>set thy House in order, for thou shalt die and not live.</hi> There are many more rusty, and filthy dregs of Sin, which as well as those must be scoured out of the Body before that it can <hi>be set in order,</hi> as of Lying, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Cursing, and such like; but those I shall leave to your consideration, hoping that you will not suffer the least of them to have any place in your Mortal Bodies.</p>
                  <p>And so proceed a little further concerning the very matter of our discourse, the thing that we are all warned unto, which is to <hi>set our Houses in order, for we must die, and not live. Set thy House,</hi> &amp;c. As it is the Custom among the Nobles and Peers of this Realm, when that they know of the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give them a visit, to have all about them in order and decency; so indeed ought every one of us to <hi>set our Houses in order,</hi> to keep our Bodies, which are the Temples of the Holy Ghost ever clean and decent, and still furnished with all sorts of Heavenly Graces to entertain such a Glorious Prince, who hath writ on his Thigh King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. It will not be long ere he come, for St. <hi>James</hi> said, <hi>In his time behold the Judge standeth before the door,</hi> and likewise, it was St. <hi>John</hi>'s the Baptist Text, saying, <hi>Repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand, he may come to day, or</hi>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:52526:109"/>
                     <hi>he may come to morrow, therefore make your selves ever ready, and set your House in order, for you shall die, and not live.</hi> First, you must furnish your selves with love, which is the complement of the Law, and an earnest desire of interchangeable affection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Christ and the Soul. Secondly, you must furnish your selves with Charity, which of all Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues is still Chief, for St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Bishop of the Gentiles, comparing it with Faith and Hope, tells you that it is the Chief, for it ever Edifieth, still suffereth, never envieth, yea, and still continueth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8. Thirdly, you must get your selves fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with patience, that with all alacrity and chearfulness of Heart, you may endure all things for Christs sake. Fourthly, you must get your selves furnished with Humility, Virtue, which when the Lord of Heaven beholds it in you, which caused him to sink into your Hearts. Fifthly, you must get your selves furnished with Hope of Everlasting Faith and Salvation. And then sixthly and lastly with Faith, which is an evidence of things not seen, thus you must get your selves <hi>set in order,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And thus far of the matter of this Admonition, and earnest Exhortation. Now I should come to the Reason, which is twofold, affirmative, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative; Affirmative, <hi>thou shalt die;</hi> and Negative, <hi>and not live. Set thy House in order, for thou shalt die, and not live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now of these severally, and first of the reason af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative, <hi>thou shalt die.</hi> Now there are three kinds of Death. First, the Death of the Body, which is a natural Death. Secondly, the Death of the Soul, which is a Spiritual Death. And then thirdly and lastly, the Death both of Body and Soul, which is Eternal Death. But that which good King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was warned of, was but only the Death of the Body, which according to the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:52526:109"/>
Statute Law Decreed in that High Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Heaven, all Men shall once taste of, no Man can escape it, for so saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto all Men that they shall once die, to all once, to many twsce, for there is a second Death, and that is truly a Death, because it is <hi>Mors Vitae,</hi> the Death of Life; the other rather a Life, because it is <hi>Mors Mortis,</hi> the Death of the Death, after which there shall be no more Death. Now as <hi>Job</hi> saith, <hi>Mans time is appointed, his Month determined, and his day numbered,</hi> yea; and (as Christ Jesus the Worlds Saviour saith) his very last hour is limited; he was made of the Mould of the Earth, he shall return again to the Earth: And as all have one Entrance into Life, the like going out shall they have to Death: Nothing we brought in, nothing we shall carry out. Naked come I out of my Mothers Womb, and naked shall I return. A Change then shall come which of the wicked is to be feared, of the godly to be desired, and of all people to be daily and hourly expected. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them that have been before you, and that shall come after you, that this is the Judgment of the Lord over all Flesh to taste of Death. <hi>All Men shall once die, for as much as all have sinned, and been disobedient unto the Laws of God.</hi> This Death of the Body is not a dying, but a departing, a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration, and <hi>Exodus</hi> of our Earthly Pilgrimage, unto our Heavenly Home; yea, a passage from the Valley of Death unto the Land of the Living: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our Souls and Bodies are separated for a while, yet shall they meet again in the receptacle of Blessed Saints and Angels with much joy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an incorruptible Crown. The Body is a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to the Soul, and Death a Goal-delivery, that frees the poor harmless Soul of those Grievances, which formerly it did endure. Length of days is
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:52526:110"/>
nothing unto us, but much grief, and Age the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of long Imprisonment; wherefore if that you would but seriously consider this, you might find Death to be rather a Friend than an Enemy, and by consequence rather to be desited than shun'd as <hi>Simeon</hi> did, as it is evident, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 29. saying, <hi>Now, Lord, lettest thou thy Servant depart in peace, according to thy Word,</hi> which by some is used thus; Now, Lord, I hope that thou wilt suffer me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part in peace, and keep my poor Immortal Soul no longer within the small circumference of this Mortal Body. The Thief upon the Cross laid down his Life most joyfully, because he saw Christ, and did stedfastly believe, that he should pass from a place of pain and misery, unto a Paradise of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and so did St. <hi>Stephen, Acts</hi> 7. 56. The Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Preacher King <hi>Solomon,</hi> lest that his Son should be deprived of such Happiness, doth by an Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Irony disswade his Son from those youthful Lusts, and sensual Pleasures, whereunto he feared that he should naturally be addicted, and that by the consideration of that dreadful account, he was to give unto God at the great and terrible day of the Lord; desiring him most earnestly not to let his House stand out of order, but ever to <hi>remember his Creator in the days of his youth,</hi> for old Age will come, saith he, and then thou shalt not be so fit by reason of much weakness and infirmities. Or else, Death may seize upon thee, <hi>For Dust shall return unto the Earth as it was, and the Spirit shall return unto God who gave it,</hi> Eccles. 12. 7. In a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yea, at the twinkling of an Eye, when once this Tyrant Death comes, it will sweep us all away. It is the Custom among us here to let Leases, one, two, or three Lives, but God lets none for more than one, and this once expired, there is no hopes of getting the Lease renewed, he suffers Man some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:52526:110"/>
to dwell in his Tenement threescore Years, and ten, <hi>Psal.</hi> 90. 10. Sometimes to fourscore, but secures none far from home, and that for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Reasons. First, to bridle our curiosity left that we should search after things too high, for <hi>quae supranos, nihil ad nos,</hi> those things that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove us, are nothing to us. Secondly, to try out patience whether that we will put our whole trust, and confidence in him, although we know not the time of our departure and dissolution; and then thirdly, to keep us in continual watchfulness, for if that we should know, when Death would come with a <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> to remove us, it would make many more careless than they are, though indeed the best of us are careless enough. Here Men do know the date of their Leases, and the expiration of the Years, but Man is meerly a Tenant at will, &amp; is put out of Possession at less than an Hours warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Wherefore now, while it is said <hi>to day, set your Houses in order, seeing that you must die, and not live.</hi> It is not sufficient at the last Hour of Death to say, <hi>Lord have mercy on me,</hi> or, <hi>Lord into thy hands I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend my Soul.</hi> But even in all our Life-time, yea, and especially in our youth, we must strive ever to <hi>set our Houses in order, for we shall die and not live. Samson</hi> was very strong, <hi>Solomon</hi> very wise, and <hi>Methusalem</hi> lived many years, yet at last they with many more were brought to Mother Earth. If it seem pleasant unto you at the present to let your rotten and ruinous Houses stand out of order, yet with all remember, what the Prophet saith, <hi>The day of Destruction is at hand, and the times of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion make haste to come on.</hi> Art thou a young Man in the <hi>April</hi> of thine Age, and hast thou thy Breasts full of Milk, and doth thy Bones run full of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, as <hi>Job</hi> speaks, and thereupon dost promise to thy self length of days, yet thou must know, also,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:52526:111"/>
that a man, even at the highest pitch of health, when he hath that same Fencer-like kind of strength, is nearest danger in the Judgment of the best Physicians, remember with all that observation of <hi>Seneca,</hi> Young Men (saith he) have Death behind them, Old Men have Death before them, and all men have Death not far from them; we may in a manner complain already that the great God of Battle threatens an utter ruin to all the World, the Earth hath trembled, the Lights of Heaven have been often darkned, Rebellions have been raised, Treasons have not long since been practised, Plagues of late have been dispers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Winds have blustered, Waters have raged; and what wants there now, but those two Arrows of God, even Sword and Fire from Heaven for us to be consumed. Is it now think you a time to buy, to sell, to eat, to drink, and to live securely in sin, as they did in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> and think of nothing else; is it now a time to say unto Almighty God, as the Nigard doth unto his Neighbour, <hi>come again to me to morrow,</hi> as that drousie Sluggard doth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>Yet a little sleep, a little slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, a little foulding of the hands to sleep.</hi> The fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Virgins supposed that the Bridegroom would not have come like an Owl or a Batt in the night, there is time enough, said they, what needs all this haste; but poor Fools, they were excluded. Oh! I cannot forbear, my very Heart even bleeds within me to think of it, yea, all the faculties of my Soul and Body are strucken with horrour and amazement, while I declare unto you, how that many Thousands now are doubtless in Hell, who purposed in time to have <hi>set their Houses in order,</hi> but being prevented by Death, are for ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. O here I could heartily wish (with <hi>Jeremy) that I had in the Wilderness a Cottage,</hi> Yea,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:52526:111"/>
I could (wish with <hi>Job) that I were a Brother to the Dragons, and a Companion to the Ostriches,</hi> whilst I think of that wish I am now uttering; nay, I could willingly desire (with the Princely Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>David) that my Heart were full of Water, and that mine Eyes were a Fountain of tears,</hi> that I might weep Day and Night, for the too too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sins of this our Age in every kind. Now you are in your preparations for Eternity, and therefore had need to be very watchful over your selves, to see that you <hi>set your Houses in order, for you shall die, and not live.</hi> And this brings me now unto the very last thing observable in my Text, and that is of the reason Negative, <hi>and shalt not live, set thy House,</hi> &amp;c: <hi>Chrysostom</hi> prying into the base Nature of Man, and finding him ever out of order, teacheth him a seven-fold consideration of himself.</p>
                  <p>First, What he is by nature, what he is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self? <hi>Dust and Ashes,</hi> Gen. 18. 2.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, What is within him? <hi>much sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, What is before him? a <hi>burning Lake,</hi> which is spoken of <hi>Isai.</hi> 30. 33.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, What is above him? an <hi>offended Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi> Deut. 32. 16.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, What is against him? <hi>Satan,</hi> and <hi>Sin;</hi> two notorious, and deadly Enemies.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, What is before him? <hi>transitory trifle;</hi> and <hi>worldly vanities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then seventhly and lastly, He desires man seriously to consider, what is behind him? <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Death,</hi> for <hi>semel aut bis morimur omnes;</hi> Some once, some twice, <hi>we must all die, and not live,</hi> You cannot, like <hi>Enoch, Heb.</hi> 11. 5. be translated, but must suffer Death as well as other Men, being common to all. Whatsoever thou dost affect, whatsoever thou dost project, so do, and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:52526:112"/>
all at once, who for any thing thou knowest, may at this very present depart out of this Life. <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> although he could not cure till Death came upon him. <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> who writ many natural Tracts concerning the last, and general consolation, of the World, could not find out a Remedy, or a Medicine for his Distemper, but died out of hand. Thus you may see, how that God spares none, but sends one thing or other to bring us to our long home. And thus far concerning the Death of the Body shall suffice, which was the Death good King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was forewarned of: Wherefore now I shall but only speak a word or two of the Soul, and likewise of the Death of the Soul, and Body, and so conclude.</p>
                  <p>First, as there is a Natural Death, <hi>viz.</hi> the Death of the Body, so likewise there is a Spiritual Death, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Soul, when it is deprived of those Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which formerly God did bestow upon it; for as the Soul is the light, and life of the Body, even so Almighty God is the light, and life of the Soul. When he takes his holy Spirit from us, then we walk in the shadow of Death, this Death is an ill Fruit of Sin; therefore let us <hi>set our Houses in order.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But secondly, As there is a natural Death, and a spiritual Death, so likewise there is an eternal Death, called in the Ornament of Grace the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Death. This Death, as well as the Death of the poor Soul is lamented by God. <hi>Esay</hi> 59. 2. <hi>As I live</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>I desire not the Death of a Sinner, but rather that he may turn from his Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness and live.</hi> I might now likewise add a fourth Death, and that is a civil Death, an undoing of our Credit, and honest Reputation, which many Men die, but this I shall leave to your consideration, and so conclude. O my dearly beloved Friends,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:52526:112"/>
consider what you are all by nature? What is within you? What is above you? What is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you? What is against you? What is before you? What is behind you? and that is, <hi>infallible Death;</hi> For here is not one here amongst you, be he never so strong, never so healthly, but that within the Revolution of a few years shall be brought in spight of his teeth unto the Grave. Wherefore let your Houses be d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>As therefore, beloved, you tender the Salvation of your poor Souls, look home, and mourn for your Original sin, steep your Eyes in Tears, write Letters of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>THere is nothing that doth evidently set before Mens Eyes the Deceits of the World, and the vanity of things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, as doth the due consideration of the uncertainty, shortness and frailty of Man's Life; for all humane Pride, and the whole glory and pomp of the World (having Man's Life for a stay and foundation) can certainly no longer endure the same Life abideth; so that Riches, Dignities, Honours, and such like, howbeit, a Man may enjoy them for a small space on Earth, yet do they never continue longer with him, than unto the Grave.</p>
               <p>The consideration whereof, together with this present occasion offered, have caused me amongst all other places of Holy Scripture to make choice of these words which I have now read unto you;
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:52526:114"/>
in which (as in a most bright shining Glass) we may behold both the frail Constitution of Man's Nature, as also the short continuance of his Life here on Earth, it being but a Vapour, and <hi>What is your Life?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This whole Chapter containeth four Dehorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; the first is from Lust, unto the fifth Verse; the second from Pride, to the Tenth; the third from speaking evil of our Neighbour, to the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth; the last from Presumption of words, to the end of the Chapter; to disswade from which sin, he useth two arguments especially; the first is drawn <hi>Ab incertitudine rerum,</hi> from the uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of things, and that's contained in the words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately going before my Text, the second is drawn <hi>á Vanitate Vitae,</hi> from the vanity of Man's Life, and that's set down in the words of my Text. Which words contain two general parts, a Question and an Answer; <hi>What is your Life?</hi> There's the Question; the Answer followeth in the next, <hi>It is even a Vapour,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>First of the Question, <hi>What is your Life?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in observe, that Life is twofold; for there is a Created Life, and there is an Increated Life; the la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ter is only to be found in God, the former is a quality in the Creature, whereby it liveth, and moveth, and acteth it self.</p>
               <p>Now Created Life is twofold, Spiritual and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural: Again, Spiritual Life is twofold; sometimes it is taken for the Life of Grace, which God's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren only do enjoy in the Spiritual Kingdom of Christ in this World; which by way of excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, is called <hi>the Life of God;</hi> not so much for that it is from God, as also all other kinds of Life are, as because God liveth in them that are his, and approveth this Life in them: And it is called (for the same respect) <hi>the Life of Christ,</hi> because
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:52526:114"/>
Christ liveth in his through a super-natural Faith and Spirit; and they live unto God, and conform their Life unto his Will: And it is called <hi>a new Life, a Christian Life,</hi> and a <hi>renewing of the Mind, Will</hi> and <hi>Affections.</hi> This Life is opposed to Death in Sin, and to the old Man. Sometimes it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the Life of Glory, whereby the Soul (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing jopned again to her Body) shall lead a Life, which the Apostle calleth <hi>Spiritual;</hi> not in respect of the Substance, but of the qualities, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 44. whereby the Faithful shall live for ever, and it is laid up in Christ, and the end of the World shall be disclosed, and which is opposed to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Death, and it is called <hi>Eternal Life.</hi> Thus much of the <hi>Spiritual Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Natural Life also is twofold; for either it may be taken generally for the Life of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whereby they live, move, and have their being; or more particularly for the Life of Man, which natural Life in Man is the act and vigour of the Soul, arising from the conjunction of the Body with the Soul; this Life is given by God, continued by Meats and Drinks, and other neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary helps, and ended by Death; this is the Life properly meant in this place.</p>

                  <hi>It is even a Vapour,</hi> &amp;c. A Vapour (according to the Philisophers) is a thin fume extracted out of the Earth, by the Sun in the night time, but in the morning (or afore) it is scattered with the Wind, or dispelled with the Sun; or else, if the Sun do not appear in his Brightness, it falleth away of it self to the Earth from whence it came, or was drawn by the heat of the Sun. Such as is the nature of a Vapour, even such is the Life of Man; for he is extracted out of the Earth by the Sun of Righteousness, and he either perisheth before he seeth the Sun, or else in the Morning of his Youth,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:52526:115"/>
or if he escape the mid and noontide of his growth, yet at the last he falleth away by Age to the Earth from whence he was taken. The Text thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, we may observe these Points of Doctrine for our Instruction.</p>
               <p>The first is the Frailty of our Constitution, in these words, <hi>It is even a Vapour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the Shortness of our continuance, <hi>Which appeareth for a little time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The vanity or nullity of our Life after Death, in these words, <hi>And afterward vanisheth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, Of the Frailty of our Constitution; the Apostle doth not compare the Life of Man to Silver or Gold, or Iron, or Brass: which are durable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances; or some Body that is <hi>Corpus perfecte mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> that is, perfectly mixed or compounded of the four Elements; but to a Vapour that is <hi>Corpus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfecte mixtum,</hi> that is, such a Body that is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly mixed; and that for two Reasons: First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it hath not <hi>perfectum Miscibilium numerum,</hi> that is, all the Elements in it; then also because it hath not <hi>perfectum Mixtionis modum,</hi> the true man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a mixt Body, and therefore it vanisheth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way into Air; either <hi>per attenuationem,</hi> by rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and attenuation (as the Philosopher speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) <hi>aut per condensationem,</hi> when it returneth to the Earth from whence it came<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And well might this our Apostle compare the Life of Man to such an Imperfect Body as a Vapour is: For first, if we consider our Birth, we are brought forth in the danger of our selves and them that bear us. Our Feet are not our own, neither are they able to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the bulk and trunk of our Body; our Tongues are not our own, our Hands are not our own; but we lye bound and wrapped for many Months toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; we Live, and yet we seem not to breathe;
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:52526:115"/>
in our Youth we are liable to many Diseases: If it be true that the Physicians say, our Eyes are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to an hundred Perils, how much more is the whole Body? Some cry, My Head, My Head, as the <hi>Shunamites</hi> Child; some are troubled with lame Legs, as <hi>Mephibosheth,</hi> some with Gouty Feet, as <hi>Asa;</hi> some are pained in the Belly, as <hi>Jeremy.</hi> This is that miserable Frailty which the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> signifieth in these words; Almighty God said unto his Prophet, <hi>Cry;</hi> and the Prophet answered, <hi>What shall I cry?</hi> God said unto him, <hi>All Flesh is Grass, and all the glory thereof like the Flower of the Field, the Grass withereth, the Flower fadeth away, but the Word of the Lord continueth for ever:</hi> Upon these words St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith thus; Truely it is even so, for the glory of Man flourisheth in the Flesh like unto Grass; which although it seem to be great, it is in very deed but little; it buddeth like a Flower, and fadeth like Grass, so that it hath no more but a certain flourishing in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and no firmness and stability in the Fruit. For what firmness can there be in the matter of Flesh? Or what good things (of any long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance) are to be found in so weak a Subject? To day thou maist see a young Man, in the flourishing time of his Age, with great Strength, Lusty, and jetting up and down in the Streets in great Bravery, with a jolly lofty Countenance; and if it so fall out, that this very next Night he be taken with some Disease, thou shalt see him the next day with a Face so far altered and changed, that whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he seemed very amiable and beautiful, he shall now seem ill-favoured, miserable and loathsom to behold; nay, Mans Fading away is such, and so sudden oftentimes, that there can be no reason given of his Death; for many have gone to Bed well in the Even, that in the Morning have bee
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:52526:116"/>
found dead in their Beds; and many suddenly have dropped down in the Highways and Streets, as they have walked about their Affairs: And this is no wonder, if we consider the Substance of Mans Body, which being a Building compact of green Clay, is easily overthrown with a small puff of Wind. This being then the frailty of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, the consideration thereof should be used, to put away and abandon our natural Pride, and make us humble our selves under the Hand of God. An Example hereof we have in <hi>Abraham,</hi> who said, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 27. <hi>Behold, I have begun to speak to my Lord, who am but Dust and Ashes.</hi> Mark here how the consideration of his frail condition, made him to abase and cast down himself in the sight of God: In like manner, if we could but consider how Frail we are, it would straightway pull down our Peacocks Feathers, and make us with <hi>Job,</hi> to abhor our selves in Dust and Ashes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The next Point I am to treat of, is the shortness of our continuance, intimated i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> these words, <hi>Which appeareth for a little time,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Man that is Born of a Woman</hi> (saith <hi>Job) is of sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, 2. In which words, in that <hi>Job</hi> compared Man to a Shadow and a Flower, he notably setteth forth the short continuance of Mans Life; a Shadow we see, if the Sun be never so little overclouded, it vanisheth away; and a Flower, we know, is a comely and beautiful thing, yet for all that, there is nothing found more fading and vanishing; even so Man du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ing the time of his Childhood and flourishing Youth, seemeth to be of a wonderful Comeliness, but his Beauty is of small Price, because it is more brittle than Glass, seeing that Man carrieth always
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:52526:116"/>
the Cause of Death in his Veins and Bowels. We see at this day, what a great matter it is for one to live Threescore and Ten, or Fourscore years, and this is commonly the ordinary Race of Mans Life; insomuch as when they live so long, they account themselves not to be evil dealt withal, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet signifieth when he saith, The days of Man are at the uttermost but Threescore and Ten Years; and if the Strongest do reach to Fourscore, what followeth is but labour and grief. Now if we should deduct those years which Infancy and Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood spendeth, if also we should take away that time which passeth away when we sleep, it would be a small number of Years that would remain; which remnant if we should compare with the Life to come, it would seem but as a drop of Water compared with the whole Sea; so short is his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Life in regard of that which lasteth always. Neither is our Life so short only, but as it is short, so is it uncertain, how long it shall continue; for though there is nothing more certain than Death, yet is there nothing more uncertain than the hour of Death; and therefore a certain Philosopher compared the Lives of Men to Bubbles that are made in Water pits, when it raineth, of the which some do vanish away suddenly, even at their very rising; others do endure a little longer, and out of hand are decayed; others do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> continue some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more, and others less: So that although they do all endure but some little time, yet (in that little) there is great variety. This being then the shortness and uncertainty of our Lives, it should teach us so much the rather to embrace our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Counsel in the Thirteenth of St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>Watch, because ye know not the day nor the hour:</hi> The which is as much as if he had more plainly said, Because ye know not that Hour, watch every
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:52526:117"/>
hour; and because ye know not that day, watch every day; and because ye know not the Month and the Year, watch therefore every Month and Year. And to make this matter more plain by a Similitude: If thou shouldest be invited to a Feast, and being set at the Table, seest before thee many and sundry sorts of Meats, a Friend of thine secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admonisheth thee, that among so many dainty Dishes, there is one Poysoned; what in this Case wouldst thou do? which of them darest thou touch or taste of? wouldst thou not suspect them all; I think (though thou wert extremely hungry) thou wouldst refrain from all, for fear of that one where the Poyson is. It is made manifest unto thee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, that in one of thy seventy Years. thy Death lieth hidden from thee, and thou art utterly Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant which year that shall be, how then can it be, but that thou must suspect them all, and fear them all? O that we understood the shortness of our Life! how great Profit and Commodity should we then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by the Meditation thereof!</p>
               <p>Thirdly and lastly, the vanity and nullity of our Life after Death, intimated in these words, <hi>And afterward vanisheth away:</hi> The whole Course of Mans Life is but a flying Shadow, a little spot of time between two Eternities, which will quickly disappear; the same Earth which we now so neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently tread upon, may suddainly receive us into her cold Imbraces. Well may Life then be said to be vanishing away, Though now we are in perfect Health, yet before to morrow some dear Friend or other may passionately follow our Hearse to the Grave. Our time past is like a Bird fled from the Hand of the owner out of sight, and our present time is vanishing away, and on Earth we have no abiding.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:52526:117"/>
But here consider, if Life be so vanishing and uncertain a thing, then</p>
               <p n="1">1. This reproveth those that Squander away their precious time, as if their abode on Earth would be too long to prepare for Eternity, if they did not mispend it half; but it is time for us to cry out, <hi>The time past is more than enough to have wrought the Will of the Flesh,</hi> 1. Pet. 4. 3. or as it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 13, 14. 'Tis high time to awake out of Sleep.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If Life be thus vanishing. then be not over solicitous as to future Events, but willingly submit to a Divine Providence; be not so much concerned for to Morrow, do not cumber your selves with too much Provision for a short Voyage.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If Life be thus short and vanishing, then do much work in a little time; shall we loose any of that time which is so fleeting and so uncertain. And thus I have briefly shown you the frailty of the Life of Man, and the profitable use we might make of this Consideration, That our Life is but <hi>a Vapour which appeareth for a little time, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward Vanisheth away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. If Life be so short and uncertain, then <hi>look upon every day as your last;</hi> so did the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> who said, <hi>I die daily;</hi> as there is nothing more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain than Death, so there is nothing more uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain than the time of Death. We are all <hi>Tenants at Will,</hi> and therefore the great Landlord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth may turn us out of our <hi>Clay Houses</hi> when he pleaseth. It was a worthy Custom of a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor that would have his Man come every morning to his Bed-side, and pronounce these Words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Remember thou art a dying Man;</hi> certainly such are justly to be reproved, who look upon Death as at a great distance from them. It is a common say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:52526:118"/>
of some, that they <hi>thought no more of such a thing, than of their dying day;</hi> surely it argues a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wicked frame of Heart to be so forgetful of <hi>Death,</hi> when 'tis that we are to expect <hi>every minute,</hi> and know not but each day that comes <hi>may be our last.</hi>

               <p>THE Lord hath set it home upon my Heart, ever since I came amongst you, earnestly to desire and to pray for the Salvation of your Souls; it hath been no small Encouragement to me to lay forth my weak endeavours in the Ministry, when I consider that he which converteth a Sinner from the Errour of his way, shall save a Soul from Death, and hide a multitude of Sin, <hi>James</hi> 5. 20. To save a Soul from Death, is so glorious an Imployment, that herein I cannot chuse but rejoice with the Apostle, when I see the word of the Kingdom working effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually in any Soul.</p>
               <p>I bless God every day without ceasing, that he hath given me a full proof of my Ministry in the Hearts and Consciences of some, even in this place, since I came among you, so that I may say with
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:52526:119"/>
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 2. and they indeed are and shall be unto me, and I unto them a Crown of rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and on their behalf I pray, that their Faith may grow exceedingly, and that their Love unto Jesus Christ, and unto all Saints. may every day more and more abound, and I commend them unto God, who is able to keep them from falling, and to present them faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding Joy.</p>
               <p>As for others, I am jealous over them with a Godly Jealousie (as the Apostle speaketh) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually praying, that they may not be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ, but that they may hold fast the mystery of Faith in a pure Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
               <p>Some indeed there are, that cause me secretly to groan in my Spirit and my Heart. I even bleed over them, and I do pity them in the Bowels of Jesus Christ, fearing least they should (like the five foolish Virgins) fall asleep, and hereafter endeavour to enter into Glory when the Door is shut. But now, dearly beloved, being come to Preach my last Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon amongst you, I request you all both good and bad to attend with double diligence, to what shall be spoken unto you from that sweet portion of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which you find recorded.</p>

                  <p>IN these Words are these two Parts, First, a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> desire, <hi>For I am in a streight between two, having a desire to depart;</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, an Inclination of the ground of it, which was this, because he might <hi>be with Christ;</hi> the word signifies <hi>solvere Anchoram,</hi> to loosen the Anchor, or to cut the Cable, that the Ship may sail after. While St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Spirit was tied up by the Flesh, he desired it should be loosened by Death, that it might Sail after into Glory. Spiritual <hi>Desires,</hi> they are always quickest and strongest, whensoever they are nearest the perfect enjoyment of their desired <hi>Object,</hi> Christ. As the motion of every natural Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is quickest and strongest, the nearer it comes to the <hi>Center;</hi> so the nearer fulness of Glory, the more <hi>fervent</hi> the Soul is in its desires after Christ.

                  <p>But here I know the timerous Soul will object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this truth, and say, Oh, how can the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian so earnestly-desire to be with Christ in the fulness of Glory? were it indeed but a short step into Glory, or were the way strewed with Roses and Flowers, and with all thè <hi>Spices</hi> of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, it might be so, but there is a Lion in the way (as <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks in another case) there is <hi>Death</hi> the King of Fears, that stands frowning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Soul at the last cast when the Soul is upon its very <hi>Entrance</hi> into Christ, his prepared Mansi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of eternal Glory; and therefore it were more desirable, to dwell safely upon the Earth in a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Heaven made up of the greatest worldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and the most delightful creature Comfort, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to venture over the terrible mountain of Death (the very Epitomy of all Discouragements) into the doubtful possession of those invissible Depths of spiritual Glory, which the Scripture tells us, is only attainable after this Life.</p>
                  <p>I answer, that by nature of this Objection, you may presently know the name of the Objector. It comes from off a carnal heart, and fully speaks the temper an <hi>Epicurean</hi> Will, that is, against leaving its carnal interest in the Earth, for uncertain interest in Heaven. But Death, though it be an interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Cloud, which seems to darken or cast a mist upon the Lustre, and Comfort of a believers spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual injoyment in God; yet it doth but seem to do so, and indeed it doth not at all extinguish the earnest desires of a serious lively Christian after
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:52526:121"/>
Christ in the fulness of Glory, and that especially when the believing Soul looks upon <hi>Death</hi> under these Considerations.</p>
                  <p>First, that to die is no worse a thing than to tread in the very steps of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> we might indeed have been afraid to die if <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> had not first stept into the cold grave before us, but if we will shew our selves true Soldiers unto Christ our Captain, we must not fear to venture, where he hath broken the way before us; Now <hi>Christ</hi> hath died that he might by his Death procure the Death of Death, and that he might free Believers from the fear of Death, the sting being taken out of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Death is only ordained to refine, and not to ruine Nature, Death ends our sins and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series, and not our life, as it may be made out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you by this following Illustration, those Trees, which seem dead in the Winter, yet they revive in the Spring, because the Body and the Arms of the Tree, they are joyned to the Root, where the Sap lies all the Winter, and by means of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction the Root it conveys life unto all the parts of the Tree. And the Bodies of Believers they have the Winter to, when as they are turned into the Dust, but their Life it is hid with Christ, at last they are revived and raised up into Glory.</p>
                  <p>Now here you may observe the great difference of Tempters, according to the various Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Mens Spirits; the <hi>Atheist</hi> he dares not die for fear of being put out of his being, and the profane Person he dares not die for fear of exchanging his present bad being for a worse, but the Believer he earnestly desires to die, that besides this present temporal being he might enjoy a future eternal well-being.</p>
                  <p>Indeed to a wicked Man, the best had been, not to have been, and this next best, were to live long; it was ill with him, that ever he was born, and wors, that he must die.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="222" facs="tcp:52526:122"/>
A Carnal Mans continual cry is this, <hi>Dum Spiro, Spero,</hi> I love to live, for my present hope is my only help; for indeed, such an one hath only help in this Life; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>but a Christians common Expression is this, <hi>Dum Exspiro Spero,</hi> Expiration is my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, for such an one hath hope in the Life to come, when a wicked Man dies, he thinks he shall live worse, but a Christian when he dies he knows he shall live better, he cries with the holy Apostle, <hi>for one to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</hi> Job. 19. 25. <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth, and he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth, and though after my Skin Worms destroy this Body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Death was never intended to be as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of good, but as a priviledge for good to the Believer, and it is attended with these several Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges.</p>
                  <p>First, Corporal and Temporal Death, it serves to set out the Beauty and Excellency of eternal Life. It is Gods usual method to set out one contrary by another, <hi>Contraria juxta se posita magis elu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>escunt.</hi> In War God commends Peace to us. In Adversity, Prosperity, in Sickness, Health, and in Death, he commends eternal Life to us.</p>
                  <p>As the Limner lays the Foundation of a curious Picture in a <hi>Dark Ground-work,</hi> so God doth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lay the foundation of our sweetest Mercies in the greatest miseries; and this he doth that his Mercies may appear more lovely in our eyes; and thus he sets off the joys of Heaven by the troubles we meet with on the Earth. It is said of <hi>Zeno</hi> that he was wont to eat bitter things, that he might the better taste sweet, and he would say, sweet things were nothing worth, if they were not so commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us. And so bitter Death, it is but an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine devised by infinite Wisdom, and for to
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:52526:122"/>
set out the Unspeakable sweetness of Everlasting Joys.</p>
                  <p>God could as easily have received all his redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ones into the immediate imbraces of Divine Love and Glory, without letting them know what it was to be tempted, to be afflicted or to die, but only for the better sweetning and endearing fulness of Glory to them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Deaths mortal Wound, it is but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory to an immortal weight of Glory. Death it is the midnight of all troubles and sorrows, which is in Travel with a morning of everlasting Joy, and Comfort. Death it is the <hi>Saturday</hi> or last day of our Weekly labours, which ushers in a <hi>Sabbath</hi> of eternal rest. Rev. 14. 13. <hi>And I heard a Voice from Heaven, saying unto me.</hi> Write, <hi>Blessed are the Dead which die in the Lord, for they rest from their Labours, and their VVorks follow after them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the Believer hath labour without rest, but in Heaven he shall have rest without Labour. Death tends indeed to a Believers perfect everlasting reign and rest.</p>
                  <p>The Believers Afflictions upon Earth, they are fore-runners of Deliverances; they are as throws to the Birth of future Comforts. The Whale which swallowed up <hi>Jonah,</hi> God appointed as the means of bringing himself to the Shore. And so the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble which we often times think may swallow us up, it brings us to our harbour Death, it lands us safely upon Glory. One excellency sets out the state of a dying Christian in these Words. <hi>Per Augusta ad Augusta, per Spinas ad rosas, per Procellas ad Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, per Mortem ad Vitam migramus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, Death it is as a Bridge that all Saints must walk over to the everlasting Hill of endless Peace, to the perfection of Grace, to the participation o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> Glory, to the full possession of Christ.</p>

                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:52526:123"/>
1. Death it leads us to the perfection of Grace, the believer would live that he might be more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but when he dies he is perfect indeed, a dying life, that is, a dying to sin, it frees us from a living Death, well doing fits us for dying. Holiness frames us for Happiness.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Death it leads us to a participation of Glory, the consummation of Grace is the inceation of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Grace that puts the Soul into a capacity of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying glimps of God as in a Glass darkly, but glory brings the Soul, <hi>ad visionem beatificam,</hi> into an immediate converse with God face to face, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. <hi>For now we see through a Glass darkly, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then I shall know even as I am known.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Death it leads us into <hi>a full possession of Christ,</hi> Luke 23, 43. <hi>This day shalt thou be with met in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,</hi> so saith <hi>Paul,</hi> Then shall we be ever with the Lord, comfort, comfort ye one another with these words, to be always with Christ will be very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable indeed. Death that deprives us of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with men, yet it delivers us up into an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate communion with God and Christ, and the blessed Angels; Saints in Heaven shall be as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, nay, saith <hi>John,</hi> now are we the Sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be, we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. <hi>Death</hi> speaks the sad disjunction of the Soul from the Body, and the sure and sweet Conjunction of the Soul with Christ, and therefore saith <hi>Paul,</hi> and every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, when he is in a right temper, <hi>I have a desire to depart, and to be with Christ, which is best of all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus I have endeavoured to lay open before you those Soul supporting, and Soul encouraging Arguments, the consideration of which, makes the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:52526:123"/>
believing Soul so willingly, and so boldly, to look Death in the Face, to invade Death in its own Quarters, which is indeed but as a Passage or Bridg, whereby the Soul is carried over unto the Mountains of <hi>Mirrh,</hi> and unto the Hill of <hi>Frankincense,</hi> where it shall lie down with Christ on his <hi>Green Bed of Love,</hi> which is perfumed all over with the fulness of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created Glory.</p>
                  <p>And thus having shewed you many Arguments, the Consideration of which doth much facilitate a Believers passage through Death into Glory. I shall in the next place, for a further Illustration of this truth, present unto you the admirable carriage and department of some famous Christians, since Christ his time, as in Relation to their contempt of Death, and earnest desiring to be with Christ in Glory; and in this Relation, I shall begin with <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved while Christ was upon the Earth, and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to several other remarkable Instances in suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive Generations.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>GOOD Lord, let our Souls be filled with breathings and pantings after Grace and Glory, Let us be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver willing (with St.</hi> Paul) to depart and to be with Christ. <hi>Let us dayly look and long to be in Heaven, where we shall sit down in the same Throne with our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and glorious Redeemer, where there will be no more sinning nor sighing, nor more weeping for dead and dying Friends. Let us long, long to be there, where time will be no more, but all will be swallowed up in an endless Eternity of joy and delight. Lord, let us often ponder upon the blessed state above, for certainly, one deep and serious consideration of the never fading Glory of the other world is enough to wing our hearts with earnest desires (as we have heard it did thy Holy Saints and Martyrs) to depart and leave this vain world to be with Christ. And good Lord, let us, when we leave a</hi> weeping House) <hi>and the many instances of our dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Friends going so often to the Grave before us, shew that we must quickly follow)</hi> be received into that Celestial Mantion above, which will prove an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal House of Joy.</p>

                  <bibl>Upon ACTS 20. 38.</bibl>
                  <q>Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, That they should see his Face no more.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>IN the latter part of this Chapter you have the Declaration of two things; <hi>First,</hi> You have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the Carriage of the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> that was, he Preach'd while he was at the Church of <hi>Ephesus. Secondly,</hi> You have declared the Character of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> when they were parting with this Blessed Preacher, in the words that I have read, and the verse before, or the two last verses, and it was full of Love, and manifested in three things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>They fell upon his Neck and kissed him,</hi> that's the close of the 37. verse.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They accompanied him unto the Ship, when he was to launch into the Ocean: They went with him as far as they could, as some of them it may be will to the very edge of Eternity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>They shew'd to him their Love, by their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ping,</hi>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:52526:127"/>
                  <hi>and Sorrowing at parting: They cannot part with dry Eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They sorrowed most of all, especially for this, that they should see his Face no more.</hi> It was not so much that <hi>Paul</hi> was to go from them, but that they should see his Face no more.</p>
               <p>From this practice of this Church, I would lay down this Doctrine, <q>That it is the property and practice of the Saints and People of God, to be sorrowful and affected at the final parting with their Pastors and Teachers;</q> This was that that most of all cut their Hearts, <hi>That they should see his Face no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Patriarch <hi>Jacob,</hi> that wrestled and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed when he came to die, as you read in <hi>Gen</hi> 49. and the last verse, That <hi>he pull'd up his Feet into the Bed, and he's goone:</hi> Now see what a Mourning there was for him in <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. 1. Joseph <hi>fell upon his Fathers Face and kissed him,</hi> and verse 3. <hi>And the</hi> Egyptians <hi>mourned for him threescore and ten days;</hi> here was a mourning for <hi>Jacob,</hi> and verse 10. <hi>They came to the Threshing floor of</hi> Atad, <hi>which is beyond</hi> Jordan, <hi>and there they Mourned with a great and very sore Lamentation: And made a Mourning for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seven daies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The young Prophet in the 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. who without doubt in the main was Faithful to God, though seduced out of his way, and out of his Life by an old Prophet, whereby a Lion was appointed by God to destroy him, but see now how the old Prophet was affected with it as soon as he hears it, causeth the Ass to be Sadled, and goes and brings the Carcase home to the City to Mourn, and to Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him, and laid him in his own Grave, in the 30. vers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, and brings all to Mourn over him, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges his Sons that when he was dead, that they Bury him in the same Sepulchre where the Man of God
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:52526:127"/>
was, and lay his Bones besides his Bones.</p>
               <p>I shall now instance in the New Testament, it was so with them of <hi>Ephesus</hi> when they parted with <hi>Paul, They should see his Face no more.</hi> He had been such a Preacher that they could not part with him without Tears, or with dry Eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Devout Men also carried</hi> Stephen <hi>to his Burial, and made great Lamentation over him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When Christ was carrying to be put to Death, there followed him a great multitude of People, and Women which also bewailed and lamented him, <hi>There was great lamentation:</hi> Oh they could not part with Jesus Christ without lamenting, <hi>That they should see his Face no more.</hi> But it will be here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected in the next verse, that Jesus Christ in <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 28. turn'd to those Women that wailed and wept, and said, <hi>Daughters of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>weep not for me, but for your selves.</hi> That therefore there ought not to be weeping or lamenting for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of any Eminent Saint, seeing he forbids it for himself; it argues indeed we should not weep for them, but for the want of them, which is ours.</p>
               <p>Why should those that are Hearers be deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected at the final departure of Holy Ministers. I answer, This arises from the love that is between them: There is a mutual Love between a Faithful Preacher and a Sincere Hearer.</p>
               <p>Where there is Love, there is Mourning in the absence of it.</p>
               <p>It's said that <hi>Israel</hi> loved <hi>Joseph</hi> more than all his Children, and therefore when News came to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> that <hi>Joseph</hi> was not: Oh! saith <hi>Jacob,</hi> ver. 35. <hi>I will go down into the Grave unto my Son mourning.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> lamented for <hi>Absolon, Ob</hi> Absolon <hi>my Son, my Son</hi> Absolon; and <hi>David</hi> lamented exceedingly for <hi>Jonathan</hi> in that 1 <hi>Kings.</hi> I am distressed for
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:52526:128"/>
thee my Brother <hi>Jonathan;</hi> if you love your Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers so as its said of them that could pull out their Eyes for them while living, you will even weep out your Eyes for them now dead.</p>
               <p>I could tell you of a thing that I have lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a Piece of Prophesie, it was Printed and Writ Ten Years before the Fire of <hi>London,</hi> and it was this.
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>London</hi> look to it, what Heaven's a doing,</l>
                     <l>Thy Flames are coming when thy <hi>Lots</hi> are going.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>When I consider who is gone, and who are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I dread. What became of <hi>Prague</hi> when <hi>Jerom</hi> was dead? What became of <hi>Germany</hi> when <hi>Luther</hi> was dead? And what will become of <hi>England</hi> when such as these are dead.</p>
               <p>Let me call upon this Congregation this Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that we would be in the <hi>Ephesians</hi> Practice, they Mourned when <hi>Paul</hi> was going, and they should <hi>see his Face no more.</hi> Your Preacher is gone, <hi>And you shall see his Face no more.</hi> I would I could raise you to their height of Mourning.</p>
               <p>He begat you in Christ Jesus, though none of his own, but Christs, and you may get one to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him, but not to exceed him, but I desire that Man to tell me where.</p>

                  <bibl>REV. 14. 13.</bibl>
                  <q>And I heard a Voice from Heaven, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto me, Write, Blessed are the Dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth; so saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their Labours, and their Works do follow them.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THE Scripture will afford us many Texts for <hi>Funerals.</hi> Methinks there is none more fit, nor more ordinarily Preached on than two: And they are both of them <hi>Voices from Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One was to <hi>Isaiah</hi> the Prophet. He was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to cry. <hi>The Voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All Flesh is Grass, and all the goodliness thereof, is as the Flower of the Field.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You will say, That is a fit Text indeed; so is this here; A <hi>Voice from Heaven too.</hi> But St. <hi>John</hi> is not commanded to cry it, as <hi>Isaiah</hi> was; he is commanded to write it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:52526:129"/>
That that is written is for the more assurance. <hi>It seemeth good to me</hi> (saith St. <hi>Luke</hi> in his Preface to his Gospel) <hi>Most excellent</hi> Theophilus, <hi>To write to thee of those things in order, that thou mightest know the certainty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Philosophers (who saw no further than the Clouds of Humane Reason) could say, <hi>A wise Mans Life should be a continual Meditation of Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> had his Sepulchre in his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> at the Publicans Feast, falls into a serious discourse of his Passion, and Ascensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to teach us that in times and places of greatest Pleasure, we should put our selves upon Theams of Mortality. Heathens indeed had their Burying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places without their Cities, but Christians in and about their Churches, as signifie that in our Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we should think upon our dissolutions, which was one reason why <hi>Alphonsus</hi> King of <hi>Arragon</hi> used to confess, that dead Men were his best Friends; they gave him sound and seasonable Counsel, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Mortality here, and provide for Eternity hereafter.</p>
               <p>To this end, St. <hi>John</hi> in his Book of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> is sometimes advising us to make Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Death.</p>
               <p>And sometimes encouraging us against the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of Death, by describing the glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the Saints departed, as in this Text, <hi>Blessed are the dead,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>From whence we may observe that they that die in a state of Grace, live in a state of Glory. This Observation I take to be the Scope and Quintessence of the Text, and therefore shall make it the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Subject of my present Discourse.</p>
               <p>First by way of Explication, to shew what it is to die in the Lord. That implies two things espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially. 1. To die in the Lord is to die for the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:52526:129"/>
Confession of the Faith. 2. To die in the Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Faith of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And lastly, To die in the Lord, is to die in the peace of a good Conscience. A Conscientious Man dies Blessedly, howsoever, or whensoever, or wheresoever he dies; therefore when St. <hi>Paul</hi> had received the Summons of Death, he fled to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of his good Conscience; there he sat like <hi>Noah</hi> in his Cabbin, in an Ark pitch'd within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. I am ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand; and here is my Comfort, <hi>I shall go to my Grave with a Conscience as clean as my Winding-sheet;</hi> it follows, <hi>I have fought a good Fight, finished my Course, kept the Faith, henceforth is laid up for me a Crown of Righteousness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Truth is confirmed by a double Reason, <hi>They Rest from their Labours, and their Works follow them.</hi> Their Blessedness consists in two things. 1. In a cessation from all Sin and Misery, <hi>They Rest,</hi> &amp;c. 2. In a possession of all Glory and Felicity, <hi>Their Works follow them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, <hi>They Rest,</hi> &amp;c. The Kingdom of Heaven is often in Scripture termed a Rest, a place of Rest.</p>
               <p>The World indeed is a troubled Sea, but Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is the Haven of Rest; the World is an <hi>Egypt,</hi> a place of Burden and Bondage, but Heaven is a <hi>Canaan,</hi> that resembled by the Bosom of <hi>Abraham,</hi> a place of sweet Refreshment, and <hi>Soul-satisfying Rest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Saints departed Rest from the Labours of their</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Corruptions.</item>
                  <item>Afflictions.</item>
                  <item>Temptations.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:52526:130"/>
And lastly, They Rest from the Labour of their particular Calling and Vocation, which is toilsome and troublesome, ever since God past this Doom upon Man for his offence in Paradise, <hi>In the Sweat of thy Brows shalt thou eat Bread.</hi> Indeed, Man in the state of Innocency; was not excused from La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: Paradise, which was <hi>Adams</hi> Store-house, was his Work-house too; God put him into the Garden, not to sleep in those sweet Bowers, not to spend his time idly in those pleasant Walks, but to dress and keep it <hi>(ut operaretur)</hi> that he might work and labour in it, only here is the difference, Labour then was a Recreation to the Mind, and now it is an Affliction to the Body.</p>
               <p>The second Reason is laid down in the last words of the Text, <hi>Their Works follow them,</hi> therefore they are Blessed: Their Happiness is not only privative, consisting in a freedom from Sin and Misery, but positive also, in a possession of all Peace and Glory, in a consummation of Grace, in a perfect Fruition of God, and a Blessed Communion with the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their Works follow them,</hi> not their Works in kind, but their Works in Issue and Effect, the Fruits and Reward of their Works, the Blessings of God which lye in the Promises to Works of Piety and Charity, These follow them to Heaven: Indeed Faith leads the way, that must be our Harbinger to take up our Lodging in the <hi>New Jerusalem,</hi> that like the Star in the East, leads us to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> where Christ is, but then good Works follow after, they are our Attendants to the Court and Kingdom of Glory.</p>
               <p>The Use, If the Saints departed rest from their Labours, here is then comfort in the general a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all Crosses and Calamities in the World, and in particular against the fear of our own Death, or the Death of Friends.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:52526:130"/>
                  <hi>Blessed are the Dead, they rest,</hi> &amp;c. Death (like Lot's Angels) plucks us out of the <hi>Sodom</hi> of Sin and Misery, and placeth us in <hi>Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ar,</hi> a City of Rest and Tranquility: Like <hi>Peter</hi>'s Angel, it shakes off the Chain of Mortality, and opens the Iron-gate, the Gate of Pearl into the <hi>New Jerusalem;</hi> like <hi>Lazarus</hi> his Angel, it conducts the Soul from Earth to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Bosom, from this Vail of Tears to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Glory. Moreover, as Death helps us to our Rest, so it is our Rest: Why should we fear it?</p>
               <p>The Scripture terms it but a taking away of the Soul to Peace, a sweet Sleep of the Body. <hi>Our friend</hi> Lazarus <hi>sleepeth,</hi> and the Patriarchs are fallen asleep, St. <hi>Stephen</hi> fell asleep: Our Burying-places are but <hi>Dormitories,</hi> Sleeping-places. <hi>The Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is taken away from the Evil to come; and he shall enter into Peace, they shall rest in their Beds.</hi> Such a Blessed Rest have the Righteous in Death; as our Saviour wept, because his Friend <hi>Lazarus</hi> was to be deprived of it; it is both the Observation of an Ancient Father, and the Resolution of an Ancient Council, concerning Christs weeping over <hi>Lazarus,</hi> John 11. 35. <hi>Doluit</hi> Lazarum, <hi>non dormientem, sed resurgentem.</hi> Christ did not weep because <hi>Lazarus</hi> was dead, and taken out of the World, but because he was to return from the Grave into a Trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some World after he was gone to his Rest.</p>
               <p>It may be for the same Reason, the <hi>Thracians</hi> of old used to lament at the Birth of their Children, but rejoice at their Funeral.</p>
               <p>The time will come that we must part with our <hi>Isaac</hi>'s, our <hi>Benjamin</hi>'s, nearest Friends, and dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Comforts. Then remember my Text; if they <hi>die in the Lord,</hi> take no care for them, they are Blessed, they are at their Rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:52526:131"/>
But some will say, Shall we meet with our Friends again departed in the Faith? Yes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out peradventure, if we walk in ways of Obedience to the end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>It was <hi>David</hi>'s Comfort upon the death of his Child. While the Child was living <hi>he fasted and wept, and lay upon the Ground;</hi> but when it was dead, <hi>he arose and anointed himself, aad eat Bread.</hi> His Reason is very strong and convincing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An impossibility of Recovery, <hi>He shall not come to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. An assured Hope of meeting again in Heaven, <hi>But I shall go to him.</hi> He shall not come to me, that would be for his loss, to part with his Rest in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for a restless condition on Earth; but I shall go to him, I have not lost him for ever, we shall meet again as comfortably as <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Joseph</hi> met in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi> meet again in Heaven and never part. Now you know it never troubles us to see the Sun set, because we know it will rise again in the Morning; it never troubles us to part with a Friend when he goes to Bed, because we hope to see him again in the Morning. Beloved, the Death of a Friend is but like the setting of the Sun, or the uncloathing of a Man when he goes to Bed, there will be a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious appearing in the Morning of the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> condemns immoderate sorrow for the dead, <hi>I would not have you sorrow as those that have no hope.</hi> Nature will be sorrowful, but let Grace moderate the sorrow, and keep it within the bounds of hope; and the ground of hope is set down, <hi>If ye believe that Jesus died, and is risen again, even so also them that sleep in Jesus, will God bring with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true, the Scripture mention some that shall not die, as they that shall be found alive at the Coming of Christ to Judgment. St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us in
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:52526:131"/>
plain terms, <hi>we shall not all sleep, but we shall be changed.</hi> The meaning is, they shall not so sleep, as to continue in the state of the dead, but be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an Eye; yet such a change, as they shall have a dissolution, and in the same moment, a redintegration, a real Death, and a real Resurrection, though no sleeping in the Grave of Corruption.</p>
               <p>You see one Generation passing, and another Generation coming, one Friend and Neighbour drops into the Grave after another, and when your turn shall be you know not. This you may be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of, Death will come certainly, and it may be speedily, it may be suddenly. <hi>What Man is he that liveth, and shall not see Death?</hi> Psal. 89. 48.</p>
               <p>Now I beseech you embrace and improve these few directions, in order to a Pious Life, and a Peaceable Death.</p>
               <p>First, if you would live to the Lord, and die in the Lord, labour for exemplary purity of Life: <hi>Not every one that saith, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom, but he that doth the Will of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, If you would live to the Lord, and die in the Lord, give the World a Bill of Divorcement, otherwise it will clip your Wings, and clog your Souls, and hinder your pursuit of Heaven; there is nothing in all the World that is worthy of your Affections, nothing but what is transitory, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfactory, and therefore look on it and pass a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>

               <p>I have now done with the Text, and now come to address my self unto that sad occasion, which hath given my present Discourse this Mourning Suit.

               <p>Concerning whom, I might upon very good and warrantable Grounds, enlarge my Discourse in the description of the blessedness, both of her Life and Death, but as the Orator said, <hi>Quid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> opus est ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis?</hi> What need is there of words, when her deeds are so manifest.</p>

               <p>AS if he had thus argued: <q>He that waites by Faith in the Redeemer of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of his Body to eternal Life, after Death hath done its worst, is not a wicked man, or an Hypocrite, as you have charged me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But such is my Faith; I believe in the Redeemer, and I look to rise (after this body is consumed and eaten of Worms) to an eternal happy Life; therefore I am not such as you judge me to be, neither wicked nor hypocrite. You account me as rejected of God, yet I know that God is my Redeemer, I know that he lives for ever, and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:52526:133"/>
that he is mine for ever, and therefore do not think, because I have no hope of this life, that therefore I despair of life: Do not take upon you, that you only know these mysteries, and that I am ignorant of them, as my Friend <hi>Bildad</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the <hi>18th.</hi> Chapter (this is the portion of Man that knows not God,) for even I also know that my Redeemer liveth, and shall stand upon the Earth at the latter day.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the former Verse we have considered and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the Confession of <hi>Job</hi>'s Faith in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
               <p>First, As living or eternal.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As rising from the Dead, or raising the Dead to Life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As judging both the Quick and Dead. He in these two Verses enlargeth the Confession of his Faith concerning his own personal Resurrection. Which,</p>
               <p>First, He asserts in the Close of the 26th Verse, <hi>In my flesh shall I see God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, In the strong actings of his Faith he assureth himself of it, notwithstanding all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that might obstruct and hinder it in the 26th Verse, and in the Close of the 27th. <hi>Though after my Skin Worms destroy this Body; though my Reins be consumed within me,</hi> yet I believe I shall see God: These Impediments do not weaken my Faith.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He declares the Benefit or Happiness which shall accrew unto him after the Resurrection of his Body, which he doth.</p>
               <p>First, In those words, <hi>I shall see God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, In those, <hi>I shall see him for my self.</hi> In both which Expressions, he sets forth the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of the Saints after the raising of their Bodies out of the Grave, and the re-union of Soul and Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:52526:134"/>
Fourthly, He maintains the identity of his flesh or body in the Resurrection, or that the same body which falls shall rise. And this is in a twofold notion.</p>
               <p>First, An identity specificial, it shall be the same Body in kind.</p>
               <p>Secondly, An identity numerical, or individual, shall be the same particular Body he had on Earth, and laid down in the Earth. Both which are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced and evinced from those passages in the Text: <hi>I shall see him in my flesh; Mine eye shall behold, and not another, I, my, mine, and not another,</hi> imply no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if not himself, or no other thing but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>From all we may collect, how excellent a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith <hi>Job</hi> made about that great mystery of the Resurrection, and how firmly his Soul was established in it.</p>
               <p>Verse 26. <hi>And though after my Skin Worms destroy this Body.</hi> As if he had more largely said; <q>After I am dead, and laid in the Grave, where Worms do not only eat my Skin, and consume this upper Garment, but my whole Body also: yea, and not only the outward Limbs and Members of my Body, but my very Bowels and Entrals. Though my Reins be consumed within me: though Worms devour, and rottenness invade whatsoever I am, or have of a Body, though I am spent from Head to Toe, from Skin to Reins, without and within, yet notwithstanding all this, I believe that I shall rise again, and see God in my flesh.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And mine Eyes shall behold, and not another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have in this Text, <hi>see,</hi> and <hi>see,</hi> and <hi>behold.</hi> The word in the original is different from what we had before, <hi>I shall behold him.</hi> It signifies more than the bare seeing, or the gathering in the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of any object into the eye. It signifies a very
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:52526:134"/>
vehement beholding; a critical discerning, view, and sight of the thing. <hi>Whom I shall behold,</hi> That is, with deep intention, both of Eye and Mind, to find out and rejoyce in all the Excellency, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Glory, and Worth that is in him. A Man may come into a Room, adorned with goodly Pictures, he sees them in passage, he hath a transient view of them, and he takes some pleasure in this view. Another beholds them, to see the Workmanship, how the lines are drawn, and Features shadowed to the life; he views with Skill and Art, this pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth much, and gives the accurate Beholder high contentment. So here, <hi>Mine eye shall behold him:</hi> That is, I shall even set my self to take a view of him, to gather up (as it were) into my self the Idea's of his divine Perfections, and so to receive all those delight and contents which rise from such an excellent object.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mine Eye shall behold, and not another;</hi> that is, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ight which I shall have of God in my glorified State, shall not be at the second hand, but such I shall have my self: The joy which I shall then receive shall not be of any report or narrative that others shall give me of the Glory of God. I shall see with mine own Eyes, not others, or not by another.</p>
               <p>The knowledge we have here, is but like that which the <hi>Samaritans</hi> had of Christ by the Womans report; but that which we shall have in Heaven shall be like that which they had of Christ when himself came personally among them, and spake immediately. Or we may illustrate it by that of the Queen of the <hi>South:</hi> The knowledge which we have of God here, and of his Glory and Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, is like that of the Queen of the <hi>South</hi> in her own Country; there she had a report of <hi>Salomon</hi>'s Person, of his Government, of his Riches and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and such a report, as did not only affect and
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:52526:135"/>
astonish her, but provoke her to undertake that great Journey, that she might see for her self, and her Eyes behold, and not another; and when she came to the Court at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and beheld <hi>Solomon</hi> in his Person and Attendance, when she observed the service of his Table, and heard his wisdom, there was no more Spirit in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>r, (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 5.) thas is, she was as one astonished, whose Spirits are sunk and dissipated. Where the natural Spirit doth not act, it is said not to be. When we come to the Court of Heaven, as the Queen of the <hi>South</hi> to <hi>Solomons</hi> Court, and there behold how much God is beyond, and above all that we have hitherto heard of him here at home in our own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, we shall be rap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> up into admiration, and there shall be indeed no more of this low and narrow Spirit in us for ever.</p>
               <p>All these conceptions about, and interpretations of the Text, are pious and profitable; but that which I rather take to be the proper meaning of these words <hi>(Mine Eye shall behold, and not another)</hi> is this; <hi>Job</hi> (as was touched in giving the analysis of these two Verses) speaks here of the Identity of his flesh in the Resurrection: <hi>I shall see him, I shall see him for my self, mine Eyes shall behold him, and not another.</hi> That is, <hi>I, the Man</hi> who stand here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, the same who <hi>Job</hi> now speaketh; I the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same numerical Person shall see God in this very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>esh, and with these eyes; they shall be indeed new dressed and dyed, trimmed, and made fit to come into the presence of the great and glorious God; yet it shall be even this flesh, and these Eyes, in which I shall come into the Presence of God, and and behold my Redeemer. I shall be altered from what I was, but I shall not be another than I was, I shall be changed into a better condition, but I shall not be changed into another person. My
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:52526:135"/>
qualities shall have a perfective alteration, but I shall retain the same matter, and be the same man. A man raised glorious and immotal, is what he was, except his Morality, and hath no more than he had, except his Glory. The Philosopher acknowledgeth there may be a specificial, but not a numerical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration of that which is corrupted. But <hi>Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>One of the Antients hath a large Discourse upon this subject, wherein he discovers some, who tho they granted the Soul immortal, yet denied the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the same Body: Such were the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionites, Basilidians,</hi> and <hi>Vàlentinians.</hi> These, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>aith he, went halves with the <hi>Sadduces</hi> in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The <hi>Sadduces</hi> denied Spirits. Hence <hi>(Acts</hi> 23. 6.) <hi>Paul</hi> perceiving that the Assembly was mixed of <hi>Sadduces</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> (and wisely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering, that if he did but mind them of their differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences between themselves, they would not so strongly agree and combine against him) he made his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of it, by professing openly that he was a <hi>Pharisee.</hi> And the sacred Historian tells us what the peculiar tenents of the <hi>Sadduces</hi> were, <hi>(v.</hi> 8.) <hi>The Sadduces say there is no Resurrection, neither Angel nor Spirit,</hi> (they denied both) <hi>but the Pharisees confess both.</hi> They held, that there were immortal Spirits or Souls, united to the bodies of Men, that those bodies should arise, and be reunited to the Soul. They also confessed that there were Angels, who are Spirits subsisting properly without Bodies Now, as the <hi>Sadduces</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:52526:136"/>
the Resurrection of the Body, so others deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Resurrection of the same Body: These he calleth sharers or halvers in the <hi>Sadduces</hi> Opinion; though not so grosly as they, yet too too grosly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from the Faith. And indeed, they who deny the Resurrection of the same body, do (by implication) altogether deny the Resurrection of the body: For if the same numerical Body should not rise, it could not be called a Resurrection; Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is the rising of that which fell, and the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up of that which was before laid down: So that it would be the Creation of a new Body, not the Resurrection of the old, if it were not the same Body. And it conduceth much to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of Saints, and may be the terrour of wicked Men, to keep close to the Faith of this Article. The Apostle seems to touch it (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10.) <hi>We shall all appear before the Judgment-seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things he hath done in his Body, according to what he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</hi> That hand which hath been doing for Christ, that very Tongue which hath been speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Christ, that whole Body which hath been moved, and acted for Jesus Christ, as an instrument of his Glory, that shall receive the Reward: As also that Hand, that Eye, that Tongue, that Foot which hath moved. and stirred against Christ, that also shall be punished, and receive according to the evil committed in the Body. Judgment would not be exact, unless as there hath been a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partnership between Soul and Body in their works, so also they should be co-Partners both in reward and punishment.</p>
               <p>If it be objected, how can the same numerical Body rise again, especially in such cases, when thousands of Carcasses are mingled, and their Dust promiscuously heapead together, or scattered abroad?
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:52526:136"/>
When the Bodies of Men are devoured by wild Beasts, and digested into the substance of Fowls and Fishes, especially when the Bodies of Men are eaten and concocted into the Bodies of other Men? How can these numerical Bodies rise? I answer, first, if we will not rest in matters of Faith, till we have a clear rational account of them, our Faith may quickly be at a stand. I answer, secondly, that as it is easie to make Objections against Faith, so Faith hath one answer as easie as these Objections. The Apostle gives it, and into that all such doubts must be resolved <hi>(Phil.</hi> 3. 20.) For having shewed the present condition, or disposition of the Spirit of Saints in the former Verse; <hi>Our Conversation is in Heaven, from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> He presently shewes what the future condition of the Saints Bodies shall be. <hi>Who shall change our vile Bodies, that they may be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioned like unto his glorious Body.</hi> (How is this, Who puts this vile Body into such a Glorioui fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Trouble not your selves for that, there is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er enough to do it, it is done,) <hi>according to the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself.</hi> This is an answer to the hardest Objections, Christ can subdue all things, therefore those which are hardest.

               <p>You ask how the same Body can be restored? I ask how the first body was Created? Tell me how God Created Heaven and Earth out of nothing? So that as the Apostle speaks <hi>(Heb</hi> 11. 3.) <hi>Things which are seen. were not made of things which do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear:</hi> How were these things done? If you argue by reason, you will be pos'd and gravel'd in these as wall as in that other; yea, you will be at a Wall, and notable to answer above that which is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and every day done, and shall continue to be

done in all the Generations of Men <hi>(Solomon</hi> puts the question <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11. 5.) <hi>Tell me how the Bones grow in the Womb of her that is with Child:</hi> Can you tell how the Child is framed? Thou canst not give an account of thy own Production, nor find out the Work of God in forming the Body?

               <p>We find our Saviour weeping over <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Grave, insomuch as the people could infer thence, <hi>See how much he loved him, John</hi> 11. 35, 36. I know no Divinity that excludes Humanity, but delights always to plant it self in soft Breasts, and either make or finds good Nature. I find in the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue and Spawn of highest Crimes (which the

               <p>So then, 'tis not only not unlawful, but a Duty to Mourn with those that Mourn, if you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Apostles Prescription, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 15. It is in the Scripture noted as an extream Judgment and Curse on the Wicked, <hi>Job</hi> 17. 15, <hi>(Psal.</hi> 78. 64.) his Widows shall not weep, as either want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leisure from other Sorrows, or liberty from their Cruel Enemies.</p>
               <p>Tears are the first Office we do for our selves, and the last for others.</p>
               <p>They may not please themselves, that can with dryest Eyes behold the Sicknesses, the Losses, the Funerals of Friends, as who had attained a greater measure of Religion or Discretion, or the Spirit, or who had subdued their Desires to a perfecter Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation, and submission to Gods Will. Let them question themselves whether this stoutness, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not from a Spirit void of Sense and Natural Affection, and not from an humble Resignation to the Providence and Pleasure of God; whether this Calm arise not alike to that of the dead Sea, from a Curse?</p>
               <p>On the other side, Though Religion forbids not Mourning, yet it forbids us to Mourn as those that have no hopes; though it excludes not all grief, yea it moderates our Grief, and teacheth us to turn our sadness to an <hi>holy sorrow.</hi>

               <p>OUR Life is divided into Labour and Rest, which <hi>Nature</hi> wisely hath contrived in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>waking</hi> and <hi>sleeping,</hi> in an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner providing the preservation of our being by a seeming dissolution of it.

well like Death. For tell me, strongest Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! How long canst thou labour without the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of rest? How long canst thou awake without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment of sleep?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But would not have you to be ignorant, Brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ve sorrow not, as others that have no hope; For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again; even so them which sleep in Jesus, God will bring with him,</hi> as affirms St. <hi>Paul.</hi> 1 <hi>Thess</hi> 4. 13. 14. <hi>John</hi> 11. 12.</p>

Yet whilst we live in this Valley of Tears, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Affection will so far prevail upon our Reason, that even the Father of the Faithful, when he was to sow his nearest Relative in the Earth, could not but Water it with a shower from his Eyes. <hi>For</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham <hi>came to Mourn for</hi> Sarah, <hi>and to weep for her,</hi> Gen. 23. 2.</p>
               <p>Attend the first words Christ spake to a Woman after his Resurrection, was it not, <hi>Why weepest thou? Joh.</hi> 20. 15. Indeed before Christ had opened the Gates of Death, <hi>Mary,</hi> nay the whole World had cause enough to weep. But now Christ the Head was risen, and had made way for all his Members to follow; now Jesus had beaten Death at his own Weapon, and kill'd it by dying, since he hath changed the Grave into a Bed, <hi>Death into Sleep,</hi> and made the Land of Darkness the ready way to the place where Light dwelleth. Tears are both unreasonable and unseasonable, <hi>why weepest thou?</hi> is as much as <hi>weep not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Considerable are the <hi>Syren</hi> and the <hi>Swan,</hi> whose different Fate is thus: The <hi>Syren</hi> Sings away her. Life in wanton Ayres, and Charms of Lust, the treacherous Inticements to Destruction, but when she dies, she breathes out her Soul in Howlings; Sighs and Sobs, in Pangs and Horror. The <hi>Swan;</hi> who spends her days in Innocence as white as her Livery, in pensive Notes of Sadness, mournful and black as her Feet, when she dies she expires in joyful Anthems, the voice of joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
<q>
                     <l>So when Death calls the Aged Swan from Streams;</l>
                     <l>She dying, sings her own glad Requiems.</l>

               <p>Good People, had you the Reversion of a Rich Living, or Office, would you weep because it is

I close, as Jesus to the Daughters of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, Weep not for me, but weep for your selves,</hi> not for me that am dying, but for your selves that are living; for your selves that have refused my Doctrine, despised your Saviour, condemned your Innocent and Righteous Prince.</p>
               <p>For the Sins and Sufferings of the Living, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, there is weeping work enough for him who hath <hi>Jeremy</hi>'s wish, <hi>His Head a Fountain of Tears to weep day and night:</hi> But for the dead that die in the Lord weep not. <hi>Weep not, she is not dead but sleepeth.</hi>

                  <head>The Application.</head>
                  <p>Since the Fare of Rest in the state of Separation; and Happiness, at meeting again of Soul and Body, depends upon the Holiness at parting: Let us be composed in both, that neither the disorder of the Body, nor multitude of Business, either ill done, or undone, may disturb the quiet of the Soul.</p>
                  <p>Before Men go to Bed they put off their Cloaths, or else they sleep both unhandsomely and uneasily. So let your Souls divest those Habits which Sin and Custom hath too long made fashion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, Good Men before they go to Bed they always pray. St. <hi>Paul</hi> adviseth, <hi>Pray always,</hi> though not with the Lip, yet with the Life.</p>

                  <p>I have done with the Text that I brought hither to you, and now apply my self and discourse, to that Text that brought you hither to me; from that I presented to your Ears, to that presented to your Eyes: I close the Book of Life, and now open the Book of Death.</p>
                  <p>So St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> Interr'd <hi>Theodosius; Nazianzen,</hi> the Immortal <hi>Athanasius;</hi> and St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Lady <hi>Marcella:</hi> Nay, St. <hi>John</hi> hath taken short Notes of a Sermon made by Christ at the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of <hi>Lazarus, John</hi> 11. 12, 13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein are Discourses of Faith, Resurrection and Glory, raised from the Dead, and applyed to the Living. Ineed no other, because I can follow no better prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, Therefore hear me, or rather hear her speak, for the Dead can speak, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 4.</p>
                  <p>Our dead Sister speaks first in the dignity of her Extraction, fairly proclaim'd to you by the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauldry of her Hearse, but fairer far in the suitable Character of her Life, the worthiness of her Birth had no other influence on her, but to engage her to worthiness of Action, which she so nobly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, that the Vertue of her Life dignified the Honour of her Descent; so the Glory she received from her Father on Earth, by the Acts of Humility, and Charity, she enhansed to the glorifying her Father which is in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Her Beauty, which was a depository from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, she beautified with so much Piety, and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with so much Religion, as if she had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted to preserve both the Lustre and the Vertues of the Celestial Bodies in her Epitome.</p>
                  <p>But the Beauty of her Soul was a Sun to this Taper, from whence her starry Actions received a mighty Splendor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="260" facs="tcp:52526:141"/>
When she spake, Wisdom dictated and Wit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, she hung her Language at your Ears as Jewels, much of worth in a small bulk; and as Jewels her Speech was Rich, both in Lustre and in Medicine; the Conceits of her Mirth would raise a Smile, but the Gravity of her Conveyance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Reverence.</p>
                  <p>Her Reproofs, like Lightning, quick, but short, such as would melt the Blade, yet not singe the Scabbard; kill the Sin, but preserve the Sinner.</p>
                  <p>Her Promises were made in her Head, but bept in her. Hand; as a Nail fastned in a sure place, driven by Understanding, and clenched by Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Her Attire neither sordid nor curious, nor too early in, nor too late out of Fashion; not like those Mushroom Gentry, who declare their late rise from Peasantry and Poverty by the Herauldry of the Dirt and Rags on their Back.</p>
                  <p>Her Table was both wholesome and handsome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to satisfie the Stomach of the hungry, and well enough to fancy the Palate of the Curious: yea when the Sword had Carved her Meat to the fifth part, her good Chear was as much as ever.</p>
                  <p>Her Visits were like the Sun's, beneficial where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e're she came, and treading in her Saviours steps, <hi>She went up and down doing good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Her Access was free but not loose, her Door, as her Heart, was open to all Friends; so that without much shifting the Scene she would easily make her House a Court, an Almes-house, a School, and an Hospital all in a day.</p>
                  <p>She had Treatments for the Greatest, who came as <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Bernice</hi> with great Pomp. She had Relief for the Poorest, who as <hi>Lazarus,</hi> lay at the Gate; Instructions for the Ignorant, and Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Remedies for the Sick; Christian Applications
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:52526:141"/>
for all, feeding the Hungry, cooling the Thirsty, cloathing the Naked, visiting the Sick, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring the Traveller; what God requires in acts of Neighbourhood here, and Reward hereafter, the whole Voyzenage can witness with me, and for her, that she was a great parallel to <hi>Dorcas,</hi> Acts 9. 36. <hi>This Woman was full of good Works and Almes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds which she did.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Finally Brethren, whatsoever things are true, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whatsoever things are of good report,</hi> she did them, therefore if there be any vertue or any praise, let her have it.</p>
                  <p>Her Relation as a Wife, shews her, without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement, a rare example and standard to her Sex.</p>
                  <p>Society is the most precious Comfort in Nature, the richest Jewel in her Cabinet, <hi>Adam</hi> not in perfect Paradise, not happy without it; of all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties with Man, that of a Wife is nearest, being made of his own Rib, and dearest, lying in his own Bosom.</p>
                  <p>Her Affection was great as <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s, wonderful and passing the love of Women, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 26.</p>
                  <p>Marriage made her Husband and her one Flesh, but Love made them one Soul. She Married not only his Person, but his Interests and Concernments, loved his Loves, wished his Desire, as inseparable as <hi>Ruth</hi> and her Mother-in-law, <hi>Ruth</hi> 1. 16, 17. not to be parted but by Death. <hi>She owed him an Affection equal to her Life,</hi> being often ready to lay it down for his Preservation, as appears by her Swouning at any News might threaten ill to him, as if her Soul conceived it but Duty to be Bail for her Husband.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Head of the Woman is the Man,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 3.
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:52526:142"/>
so her Husband wore the principality, she received influence from him, and gave conformity to him. <hi>But a Vertuous Woman is a Crown to that Head,</hi> Prov. 12. 14. so she gave safety, plenty, and honour to her head, as <hi>Crown</hi> may signifie. <hi>The Heart of her Husband did fafely trust in her she did do him good and not ill all the days of her life.</hi> Longer she is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged;<hi>—Till death us depart—</hi>was their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Death ends her natural Relation, and enters her into a Divine; which she began here by her Religion.</p>
                  <p>Her Religion was not as her Sex, Female; that is, all Face and Tongue, but pure and solid, not despising the Form, but delighting in the Power of Godliness. She attired not her Devotion as the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians</hi> did their Gods, according to the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Fashions of each City, so to gain Reputation from Man; but she persevered in the constant sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantials of Religion, so to gain Grace and Favour from God.</p>
                  <p>To whom with the Father and Holy Ghost, be Glory and Honour, now and for ever.</p>

               <head>Good Night.</head>
               <p>NOW art thou drawing near thy home, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is within sight, and its Melody almost within hearing, thy Lord hath the Curtain in his hand ready to draw it, to shew thee all that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that hitherto he hath been but telling thee of, and give thee a Possession of all that which hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thou hast enjoyed only in Hopes and Title. What dost thou fear and shrug, and tremble at, Oh my Soul, thou peevish froward Creature? Shall his Angels stand waiting to convey thy departed Soul home with Songs of Triumph? And shall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of all this abate thy Fears, silence thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and bring thee to a Chearful Submission? Fear not then my Soul, but boldly throw thy self into his Arms, who will certainly keep that safe which thou committest to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But what if I was willing to bid adieu to my Fathers House, and leave this World, and all its Enjoyments behind me, as being sufficiently tired with the Frustrations of a pursued Happiness therein? Yet methinks, the change I shall pass at Death, will be so very great and amazing, I fear I shall not bear it. To go hence from them I know, to a Place and Company I never knew or saw in all my Life; to leave my Friends, Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Neighbours, with whom I have a long time lived, and with whom I have familiarly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:52526:143"/>
to go into a Country where I may not meet with one face I know; how strangely shall we look on one another? What little content do I take in any company on Earth, where I meet with shiness? Will it not be so in Heaven?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Art thou truly Godly? said the pious <hi>Wadsworth,</hi> in his Answer to the Fear of Death; and dost thou say thou knowest none in Heaven? that is strange. Who is he whom you call Father, every time you pray? what are you born of God? united to God by faith and love? and hold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, and yet not know him?</p>
               <p>Well, sayst thou, but if I know him, it is but very little, <hi>I never saw him in all my Life?</hi> And what if thou hast not seen him with thy bodily eyes? yet hast thou not believed in him whom thou hast not seen, and rejoiced with joy unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and full of glory? Though thou hast not known him after the Flesh, yet thou hast after the Spirit.</p>
               <p>But comfort thy self, though thou hast known him but little, and that through a vail darkly, yet he knoweth thee most perfectly: He knows thee by name, and separated thee to himself from the Womb, and effectually called and justified thee; he knows thee by thy name, and knows thy dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and visiteth thee every morning, and is with thee living, and will not leave thee dying; and when he hath taken thee to himself in the Heavens, thou shalt know him as he knows thee, that is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately, perfectly.</p>
               <p>But sayst thou, if I know in some measure God and his Son, the Lord of that City, I know no more. There are ten thousands of Angels there, and I know not one of them, and as many Spirits of just men, some little acquaintance I had with
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:52526:143"/>
some of the latter on earth, but since arrived thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they are so transfigured, so wonderfully changed, I shall not know one of them when I see them.</p>
               <p>What if thou knowest not one Angel in all the Heavens? is it not enough that many of them may know thee? But how do I know that? How? thou hast been their special Charge ever since thou wast born to Jesus Christ. Are they not all ministring Spirits to them that are Heirs of Glory. How kindly did an Angel comfort <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> and the other <hi>Mary,</hi> when they early came to visit the holy Sepulchre of our Lord? How well did he know their Persons, and their Business; when he said, Mat. 28. 5. <hi>Fear not, I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified; he is not here; for he is risen, as he said: Come see the place where the Lord lay, and go quickly, and tell his Disciples that he is risen from the Dead, and behold he goeth before you into</hi> Galilee, <hi>there shall ye see him so, as I have told you.</hi> What Discourse could be more kind, friendly, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar than this?</p>
               <p>But that thou shouldst think thy self an utter stranger to all the Spirits of the Just, is more strange, when there may be some of thy near Relations there, and many of those that thou hast had for many years such sweet Eellowship in the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Gospel. If I shall sit down with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in the Kingdom; surely, I shall know them to be such.</p>
               <p>Besides, their Natures in Heaven are all perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gracious and holy, and I shall be like them, and we shall all know each other to be so; and what shiness can there possible be among such, who are satisfied in each others sincere love and affection? Thou mayst be acquainted with a thousand Saints an Angels in an hours time as if thou hadst known them a thousand years.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:52526:144"/>
And if this be so, be not, poor Soul, amazed at this great change of Company at Death: For it is but as dying Doctor <hi>Preston</hi> said, <hi>I shall change my Place, but not my Company.</hi>

                  <p>HAppy is he, who always, and in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place so lives, as to spend his eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry last moment of Light, as if day were never to return. <hi>Epictetus</hi> most wisely teaching this; <hi>Death,</hi> saith he, <hi>and Banishment, and all that we look upon as Evils, let them be daily set before thy Eyes: but of all most chiefly Death. So shalt thou think upon nothing that is too low, nor too ardently co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet anything.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Miserable diminitive Mortals, wherefore d'ye teach long Hopes? Wherefore d'ye undertake such a vast heap of Business? That shall be perhaps to Morrow, a meer Spark and Ashes. Walk curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, O Man! That dismal Goddess continually hovers over our Heads; and waits for the last Sands of our Lives Hour-glass with an unwearied and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-sleeping Eye; and wilt not thou watch after her?</p>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. The remembrance of Death is a powerful Remedy against all Sins.</head>
                  <p>THE serious remembrance of Death shakes off all sense of pleasure, and turns Honey into Wormwood. The Expectation of Death, saith <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> suffers us not to be sensible of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and Pleasures we injoy. And indeed what is it not able to do, when consider'd not only in the Extremities of the Fingers, and as it were in the Hair, but over the whole Body. Death spares no Age, nor no Degree of Dignity. Here dies a young Man, there an Infant, there an old Man. Another by Poyson, or a Fall, another by a slow Rhume, another by a quick descent of Humour; here lyes another oppress'd with a mighty Shower, or the Waves, there lyes another struck with Thunder. Among so many doubtful, so many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, so many sudden Accidents, what security, or what mind to sin among so many Incertainties? Therefore, since we daily die, think upon the Hour-glass, whether the old fashion'd one running Water, or the new one running Sand. Do ye not find that by dropping of the Water, and the passage of the Sand the upper Glass empties and the lower Glass fills? Consider that it is so with Life, every moment something slides away, the present Life empties, and flows into another. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is here safe; not the Hour of the Hour, nor the Moment of the Moment. Happy he, to whom every day is the last; more happy he, to whom every Hour; most happy he, to whom every Moment is the utmost period of his Thoughts. He will abstain from the wickedness of his hands who believes every Hour decreed, every Moment his
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52526:146"/>
last. O vain Hope! How many dost thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive? How many, to whom thou promisest old Age, dost thou cut off in the midst of their Course? Believe therefore that may happen to thee, which happ'ns to many. How many has Death prevented in the midst of their wickedness, and cut off half the Crime? How many fall with a revengeful Mind, though with an Innocent Hand? How many snatch'd away in the attempt, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the reward of their Impiety? Many in the very Moment of a wicked Action begun, have been forc'd to leave their ill designs unfinish'd. What if thou shouldst be in the number of those? What Hour or Moment is more certain to thee than to another? Now who can expect a Crime from such a Thought, as with the Crime expects Death, and with Death, Punishment. No prudent Man plays or sports in the midst of a Storm. No Man at the brink of a Precipice meditates mischief. No Man is merry unarmed in the midst of his Armed Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. More stupid is he, whom the perpetual fear of Death, when every Hour is doubtful, every Moment uncertain, dares those things that procure an unhappy Death to Eternity. O Fools! Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do we run to be punish'd for ever? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do we not follow the Council of the Son of <hi>Syras? In all thy work,</hi> saith he, <hi>remember thy last, and thou shalt not sin.</hi>

                  <p>THE day Lilly is a Flower, whose Beauty pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes in a day. There is also a Bird haunts the River <hi>Hypanis,</hi> called <hi>Haemerobios,</hi> or the Bird of one day; ending its Life the same day that it begins; dying with the dying Sun, and travelling through the Ages of Childhood, Youth and Old Age in one day. In the Morning it is hatch'd, at Noon it flourishes, in the Evening it grows old and dies. But this is more to be wonder'd at in that winged Creature, that it makes no less provision for one little day, than if it were to live the Age of a Crow or a Raven, To this little Animal the Life of Man is most fitly to be compar'd. It in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habits by the River of gliding Time: But more fleet than either Bird or Arrow. And often only one day determines all its Pomp, oft-times an Hour, and as often a Moment. Wherefore then do we think of Years and Ages, frequently no longer had then Flowers, or the shadows of Flowers; or then any thing, if any thing can be, more short and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding than those Flowers.</p>
                  <p>It is a wonder greatly to be admir'd, that this swift Brevity of Life should be divulg'd by all the Prophets, be confirm'd by the Writers of all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and yet that miserable Men should be deaf to

all their Exclamations. <hi>Ezechias</hi> cries out by <hi>Isai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> the Prophet, <hi>From the Morning till the Evening thou shalt conclude my days.</hi> The Royal Psalmist cries out, <hi>My days have past away like a shadow. Josiah</hi> the King cries out, <hi>Man springs up like a Flower, and is trod down, and vanishes like a shadow. Behold Man is like a Bubble; all thy Life is the flight of a shadow.</hi> Canst thou then dream of any Mansion or Abiding place here? Wherefore dost thou covetously scrape together; wherefore dost thou scrape and rake, as if to live the Age of <hi>Nes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi> Death is at thy Back, Thou shalt go hence, before thou fear'st thy departure, unless thou art afraid betimes.

With him I am in Tribulation, he shall deliver me, and I will glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him. And this truely, for God is at hand to those that are afflicted in Mind, and will save the humble in Heart. Concerning these Promises St. <hi>Austin</hi> has been perspicuous. Fear not, saith he, when thou art in Affliction, lest God should not be with thee: God is present with those that are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted in Mind. He assists in the Conflict, (consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) who proclaim'd the Conflict. God does not so behold thee striving for the Race, as the people look upon the Chariot Driver. They can shout and bawl, but know not how to help. They can prepare the Crown, but cannot afford strength. For Man is but Man, and no God. And perhaps, while he looks on, he labours more as he sits, than the other in the Contest. God when he beholds his Wrastlers, assists his Invokers. For the voice of the Wrastler is in the Psalm. <hi>If I said, my foot was mov'd, thy Mercy shall assist me.</hi> Therefore when thou beginst to be afflicted, summon up thy Faith, and thou shalt know the Vertue of it; for he will not forsake thee. But thou therefore thinkst thy self forsaken, because he does not deliver thee, just when thou wouldst have him. He deliver'd the Children out of the Fire. He that deliver'd the three Children, did he desert the <hi>Maccabees?</hi> Ear be any such thought. He deliver'd both these and them. Those Corporally, that unbelievers might be confounded; these Spiritually, that the Faithful might imitate. For the Lord is at hand to those that are afflicted in mind, and shall deliver the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

in Spirit. God is above, the Christian beneath. If he would that the high God should be near him, let him be humble. Great Mysteries, my Brethren, God is above all things. Dost thou exalt thy self? Thou dost not move him. Dost thou humble thy self? He will descend to thee. Therefore invoke to thy Aid this most faithful Assistant; he will be present, at one sigh, so it be serious. And God shall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes; and there shall be no more death; neither sorrow, nor crying; neither shall there be any more pain, for the former things are pass'd away. Most truely said the same St. <hi>Austin,</hi> with how much sweetness does he be wail himself, that prays!

                  <p>This I must not omit very wonderful, unheard of, and pleasant in the Relation. <hi>Lodowic Cortusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> a Lawyer of <hi>Padua,</hi> forbid to his Relations all Tears and Lamentations by his will.

                  <p>SEveral miserable People who deem it more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to die than live, torment themselves by what means to rid themselves out of the World. Whether to whet their Knives, temper their Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, make use of Ropes, or Precipices; as if it requir'd so much Ceremony and Labour to dissolve and untye the weak knot that holds the Body and Soul together. None of these did <hi>Coma,</hi> the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Diogenes</hi> need. His Soul shut close up in his own Breast found out the way, For a little study serves to retain that good, the frail possession whereof is shaken with the least puff of Violence. Death is every where, and lyes lurking in all places and at all times. Where-ever thou goest thou shalt find him prepar'd; he is never unprepar'd, but meets thee at every turn.</p>
                  <p>But when only Death is enough for one Man to desire, wherefore before the last Death, do so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Deaths assassinate miserable Man; so that the Question may not be ask'd in vain.

Because Death expects thee eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, if thou beest wise, expect that every where.

According to this Conception Painters and other Artificers describe the Triumpher over all Human kind. For they Picture him without Ears; as not hearing the Prayers of any; blind also, as not moved with the Tears of any. He is Painted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Tongue or Lips, that Men should not think to receive the least word of Comfort from him: He is Painted without Flesh, to shew that he wants all sense of Humanity. Only his Nerve, Arteries and Muscles, his Bow and Arrows, his Darts and Stings remain behind to strike poor miserable Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals. And surely then, if ever he shewed his rage, and insulted over the World, when he assailed Christ himself the Son of God, the Author of Life, at what time the very Rocks wept, the Earth trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, the Stars bewailed, the Sun grew pale, and Angels mourned; acting a dismal Tragedy upon the Life of Life it self. Whoever thou art, if thou art a Man, Death will be inexorable to thee. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be mindful of Death, the Hour flies; from thence my admonition.

For what is your Life? It is even a Vapour that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. Whereas we ought to say, If the Lord will we shall live and do this or that.</p>
                  <p>We shall all go, all—all—for we all die and sink into the Earth like Water, that never returns. Neither canst thou be ignorant that thou art so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, as to remember that there is a Law set at the same time by the Nature of all things, both for receiving and restoring thy breach. And as no man dies that has not lived, so no man lives that shall not die: Though when he shall die is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. And therefore Christ, stirring us up by a most faithful Exhortation, Take ye heed, watch and pray, for ye know not when the time is: And then repeating the same again, <hi>VVatch ye therefore,</hi> saith he, <hi>for ye know not when the Master of the House cometh, at evening, or at midnighe, or at the</hi>

He tears up the Gates with Gunpowder, Fire, Water, Pestilence, Venom, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>In the year 1559. <hi>Henry</hi> the Second King of <hi>France</hi> was slain in the midst of his Pastimes and Triumphs, and in publick Joy of the people. For while he Celebrated the Nuptials of his Daughter at <hi>Paris,</hi> in a Tilting, the Splinter of a broken Lance flew with that violence and pierced his Eye that he died immediately. In the year 1491. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonsus</hi> the Son of <hi>John</hi> the Second King of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> being about Sixteen years of Age, a Prince of great Hopes and Wit, took to Wife <hi>Isabella</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> whose Dowry was the Ample Inheritance of her Fathers King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. The Nuptials were Celebrated with the preparations of six hundred Triumphs. Every Plays, Running, Racing, Tilting, Banquets. So much Plenty, so much Luxury, that the Horse-boys and Slaves glistered in Tissue. But Oh immense Grief, hardly the seventh Month had passed when the young Prince, sporting a Horseback upon the Banks of <hi>Tagus,</hi> was thrown from his Horse to the ground, so that his Scull was broken, and he wounded to death. He was carried to a Fishers House, scarce big enough to contain him and two of his Followers. There he lay down upon a Bed of Straw and expired. The King flies thither with the Queen his Mother. There they behold the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Spectacle; their Pomp turn'd into Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the growing Youth of their Son, his Vertues, Wealth, like Flowers on a sudden disrobed by the Northwinds blast, and all to be Buried in a misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Grave.

                  <p>What sha'l I remember any more? <hi>Basilius</hi> the Emperor was gored to death by a Hart, while he was entangled in a troublesom Bough. The anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Monument in the Camp of <hi>Ambrosius,</hi> near <hi>Aenipontus,</hi> witnesses, That a Noble Youth, though under Age, set Spurs to his Horse to make him leap a Ditch, twenty foot broad: The H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>But this sudden Fate is common, as well to the good as to the bad, neither does it argue an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy condition of the Soul, unless any person in the Act of burning Impiety feel himself struck with the Dart of Divine Vengeance.

                  <p>So many Pores of the Body, so many little doors for Death. Death does not shew himself always near, yet is he always at hand. What is more stupid than to wonder that that should fall out at any time, which may happen every day. Our

He rises, careless of his Dream, goes to Church with his Friends; in the way he sees a Lion of Stone gaping, that upheld a Pillar; then declaring his Dream to his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not without Laughter. <hi>Behold,</hi> said he, <hi>this is the Lion that tore me in the Night.</hi> So saying, he thrust his hand into the Lions Jaws, crying to the Statue, <hi>Thou hast thy Enemy, now shut thy Jaws, and if thou canst bite my hand.</hi> He had no sooner said the word, but he received a deadly wound, in that place where he thought he could have no harm. For at the bottom of the Lions Mouth lay a Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, which no sooner felt his hand, but he put forth his sting and stung the young Man to Death.

                  <p>HEre Reader, though out of order, I will give thee three Prayers as Examples, made against sudden Death. It is at thy choice, every day to make use of one or all cordially and sincerely. They are designed so many, it being but reason that we should fall three times, at the Feet of Christ, when we beg so great a Boon. For this we must know that in this respect there can be no Man too cautious or too provident.</p>
                  <div type="prayer">

most hitter Cross and Passion, by all thy Tender Goodness most humbly I beseech thee, that thou wouldst be pleased not to permit me to depart out of this Life by a sudden death, without receiving my <hi>viaticum</hi> for Heaven.</p>

Thy Hands, O my Redeemer made me, and formed me throughout. O do not suddenly cast me headlong. Grant me, I beseech thee, time of Repentance; grant me an Exit hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and in thy favour; that I may love thee with my whole Mind, that I may praise and bless thee to all Eternity.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheless, O merciful Jesu, all things are in thy power; nor is there any one who can resist thy will. My Life depends upon thy nod; that must end when it is thy pleasure. Neither do I desire, my most gracious God, but that my will should be conformable to thine. In whatever place, at whatever time, by whatever Disease thou art pleased to call me home, thy will be done All these things I commit to thy Goodness, and to thy Divine Providence. I except no place or time, no sort of Death, though never so ignominious: This only one thing, I beg of thee, O Christ my God, that I may not die an unexpected and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:52526:159"/>
Death: Nevertheless, not mine, but thy will be done. If it so pleases thee, that I must die a sudden Death, I do not repine. Let thy will be done in all things, O God. For I hope and trust, through thy great Mercy, for the sake of which I make this only Prayer, that I shall die in thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and grace; wherein if I'depart, not sudden death can separate me from thee. For the Just Man, though prevented by Death, shall be happy. There is no Death can be unexpected, to him whose Life has been always provident.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, if I have not space and time (which is only known to thee, O God,) wherein to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend my self to thee; behold I do that now, and as submissively and as ardently as I am able, I send up my Prayer to Heaven to thee. <hi>Have mercy on me, O God, according to thy tender loving kindness; thy will be done, O Lord, in Heaven; and in Earth, into thy hands I commend my Spirit. Thou hast re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed me, O Lord God of Truth.</hi> Let all Created Beings bless and praise thee, O God.

                  <p>AS we may meet with old Men, not old Men but Children, so we may meet with young Men, not young Men, but stricken in years. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> the Hermit an old Man of Seventy years, when <hi>Jehosaphat</hi> the King asked him how old he was, answered Forty five, at which when the King ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, he reply'd, that he had been absent from his Studies Twenty five years; as if those years which he had spent upon the Vanity of the World had been quite lost. So <hi>Similius,</hi> being Buried in the Cares of the Court, and living rather for his Emperors sake than for his own, caused this Inscription to be put upon his Tomb. <hi>Here lyes</hi> Similius, <hi>an old Man of Seven years of Age</hi> The Book of <hi>Samuel</hi> relates of <hi>Saul</hi> that he was the Son of one year when he began to Reign, but that he Raigned Two years over <hi>Israel. Saul</hi> at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Reign was as free and Innocent from all wickedness as a Child of one year old, but he continued in this purity but one year, though he Reigned Twenty years in all. Many attain to old Age betimes, and before they are old. But the most of Men, never; who when they are old, yet retain the Vices of Children still; so that they die Children of a hundred years of Age. The Happiness of Life consists not in the length or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thereof, but in the use of it: And it may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten happen that he that has lived long, has not lived at all. Wherefore there is nothing more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous than a childish old Man, who has no other
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52526:161"/>
Argument to prove his long Life but his Age. Elegantly St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> concerning St. <hi>Agnes.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy was reckoned in her year, but a vast Age of mind. The Oracle of Divine Venerable old Age is not lasting, nor to be computed by number of years: But the Senses of men are grey, and old Age is an immaculate Life. And therefore the Manners rather than the Hairs of men are to be esteemed Venerable. Only he is worthy of more reverence who is old betimes. An honest Life is the best old Age.</p>
                  <p>Yet, you will say, a man so early dead might have proved a great Man, and serviceable to his Countrey. Rather (which is more to be feared, he might have become like others. Behold young men, whom Luxury drives into all Vice, over whose Head there passes not a day without some signal Crime. Therefore he is taken away, left Evil should change his Intellect, or lest a Fiction should deceive his Soul. Whoever comes to the Extremity of his Fate, he dies an old Man. Oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a long Life, the least thing to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered is that he has lived. 'Tis much more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to be old in Vertue, than in time. He has lived long enough, who has said well. He has sought well that overcomes.</p>

                  <p>A Short time of Age, is long enough to live well, saith <hi>Tully.</hi> No man dies so soon, who intends not to live better than he has done. A Beardless Youth has numbered years enough, who has lived to Vertue and Eternity, for which
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:52526:161"/>
he was Born. Has he not spoke enough, that can perswade with one word or a nod? Has he not said enough, who arrives happily at his Port. But best of all, he that soonest attains it. So that death prevent not our Meditation, the swifter, the more happy it will be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But I</hi> (saith the Macedonian King in <hi>Curtius) who number not my years but my Victories, if I number the Gifts of Fortune have lived long enough.</hi> How much more truely he, who Consecrates all his Life to God, and only studies to serve and please his Master faithfully, may say, I who count not these years wherein I serve God, but my desires, if I rightly compute the Benefits of my God, have lived long enough. So it is most certainly; he lives a Hundred, yea, a Thousand years, yea, Ages them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and serves God, whoever sincerely and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially desires to serve his God so long, were it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him so long to live. For God accepts the will for the deed: With whom to intend a pious Action, is oft-times as much as to have performed it. So he may be a Martyr, and expend his Blood with a Christian Valour, though he die in his Bed. So a Man may live long, and act, and suffer coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously for Christ, whoever earnestly desires to live to that end.

                  <p>THE <hi>Turkish</hi> Moschee at <hi>Caire</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> was Built by this means. <hi>Assan Basha,</hi> a person as well Cunning as Covetous, resolving to raise himself a Name in the World by some great Structure, yet not willing to be at the Cost himself, found out this Trick. He caused Proclamation to be made in all places, that he intended to erect a vast and sumptuous Temple to God. Now that the work might go on the more prosperously, he promised large Wages to all that should come to help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Work. And a certain day was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to divide the Money. This Proclamation as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled together a vast multitude. not only from all parts of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but from several other Regions and Kingdoms; against their coming <hi>Assan</hi> had caused a great number of new Shirts and Vests to be prepar'd. Which done, those that came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Wages, were order'd to pass singly out of the great Court, where they met into another Court equally as big through several little by Doors. Where they were stript of their old Garments, and new Shirts and Vests impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon them. All this was done to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that whatever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>o many thousands had brought to bear their Expences, should be left in that place.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52526:164"/>
For in those Countreys the people are wont to sow their Money in their Shirts or their Vests. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a hidious Out-cry and Lamentation arose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people. But the <hi>Basha</hi> contemning the Clamours and Cries of the people, threw all their Cloaths into a vast Fire and burnt them. Which huge Bonfire produced such vast heaps of Silver as easily sufficed for the Edifice. Thus Death deals by us; it takes from us against our Wills our old Garments, and cloaths us with a new Sepulcher: For we, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that are in this Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, do groan, being burthened, not for that we would be uncloathed, but cloathed upon. But in vain we resist. Death derides our Clamours, our Tears; whether we will or no, the old Garment must go off. Uncase and be gone, All are tyed to the same Condition. Who happens to be Born, of necessity must die. We are distinguished by Intervals, but our Exit is the same.</p>
                  <p>But hear how the Cruelty of this most Covetous Man was revenged. The Turkish Emperor being informed of <hi>Assan</hi>'s Wickedness, sent <hi>Ibram Basha</hi> to him with Letters, wherein he severely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him, that so soon as he had received the Letters from <hi>Ibram,</hi> he should immediateiy send his own Head to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> Such Fatal Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as those the Turkish Emperor is wont to write with his own hand, and to bind about with black Silk; and generally they contain these words, <hi>Send me thy Head.</hi> Whoever thou art, King or <hi>Caesar,</hi> when the Emperor of Heaven sends thee his black Letters. there's no resisting, no excuse, no deprecation will serve. 'Tis in vain to fly or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, the Sentence is decreed. Therefore do this and trample upon necessity What thou shouldst be compelled to do against thy will, that do of thy own accord. Send thy Head; not to a Tyrant,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:52526:165"/>
but to a Father; not to a Man, but to God. Make no delay, but be willing to die. For why should not the Will prevent Necessity. 'Tis the part of Necessity to submit, but of Vertue to be willing.</p>

Thou art deceived, the Wise Man calmly meditates upon it; no otherwise than he beholds the Winds and the Sails of a Ship as the Instruments that bring him into the Haven.

                     <hi>ABraham,</hi> that great Person, when he, by the command of God, had been forced as a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim, to war der from place to place, minded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than the Purchase of a Burying-place. That he would have to be so surely his own, that he might possess it by all the Right and Law imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For this reason he paid down the Money de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of the Seller, <hi>Currant Money among the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants.</hi> Nor was it enough for him that the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase should be publickly made; he required that all the Inhabitants of the Countrey should be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of the Bargain. Whereby that person of high Credit intimated, that nothing is more a Mans Property than his Sepulchre, which he may truely above any thing else call his own; according to the Example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the best of Men always reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning it among their chiefest Cares, to take care of their Sepulchers.</p>
                  <p>The Emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi> the First, three years before he died, caused his Coffin, made of Oak, to be put up in a great Chest, and carried along with him, where-ever he went; and provided by his VVill, that his Body should be put into it without Embalming, wrapt in Linnen, without any Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balming or Disembowelling, his Nose, Mouth and Ears only being filled with Quick-lime. VVhat meant that great Personage? Only to have his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument always in his sight, to give him this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual

Document, <hi>Think upon Death,</hi> that it should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so farther say, where dost thou amplifie and extol thy self; wherefore dost thou possess so much and cover more? Thee whom so many Provinces and Kingdoms will not contain, a little Chest must hold. But why did he put the Lime into those hollow parts? Behold the Spices that Embalmed him. <hi>Maximilian,</hi> that thou wert great thy acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons declare, but this more especially before thy Death.</p>
                  <p>What need I call to mind the Bier of <hi>Ablavius,</hi> who being Captain of the Pretorian Bands, a Prince among the Courtiers of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, an insatiable Devourer of Gold, which he thought upon more than his Tomb. This Person, <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> taking by the Hand, How long, said he, Friend shall we heap up Treasure: and speaking those words, with the Spear that he held in his Hand, he drew out the form of a Coffin in the Dust, and then proceeding, though thou hadst all the Riches in the World, yet after thou art dead a place or Chest, no bigger than this, which I have here marked out, must contain thee; if so large a piece of Ground do come to thy Lot. <hi>Constantine</hi> was a Prophet: For <hi>Ablavius</hi> being cut into Bits, had not a piece left big enough to be Buried.</p>
                  <p>The Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, of Famous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, most piously imitating that <hi>Maximilian</hi> whom I have mentioned, long before his Death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himself of his own accord from publick Affairs, and having resigned his. Cares to his Young and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Son, shut himself up in the Monastery of St. <hi>Justus</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> only with twelve of his Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks, applying himself to Religious Duties. He forbid himself to be called by any other Name than <hi>Charles;</hi> and disclaiming with Business the Names of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Augustus,</hi> contemned whatever sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52526:166"/>
of Honourable Title. This also is farther reported, that long before the resignation of his Empire, he caused a Sepulcher to be made him with all its Funeral Furniture, which was private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carried about with him where-ever he went. This he had five years by him in all places, even when he Marched against the French to <hi>Millaine,</hi> causing it every Night to be placed in his Chamber. Some that waited on him imagine the Chest had been full of Treasure, others full of Ancient Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; some thought one thing, some another But <hi>Caesar</hi> well knowing what it contained, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he carried it about, smiling said, that he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it with him for the use of a thing which was most dear to him in the World. Thus <hi>Charles</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually thought upon Death, and every day could say, <hi>I have lived;</hi> rising every day to Heavenly Gain.</p>
                  <p>Many others have happily imitated <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperor, who have been used, twice every day to contemplate their Coffins, the Monument of their Death. <hi>Genebald</hi>

                  <p>IT is a Flower, a Smoak, a Shadow, the Shadow of a Shadow. A Bubble, Dust, Froth, Dew, a Drop. It is Ice, the Rainbow, a wasted Torch, a Bag with holes in it, a ruinous House, treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Ashes, a Spring day, a most inconstant <hi>April,</hi> one twang of a Harp, a broken Bucket, the Wheel of a Well, a Spiders VVeb, a little drop of the Sea, a slender Stalk, a Solstitial Plant, a short Fable, a shooting Spark, a little Cloud, a Bladder full of VVind, a Doves Neck glistering in the Sun. Life is a thin Glass, a tender Leaf, a fine Silk Thread, a Golden Apple rotten within. If a shadow be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing say whar is the Dream of a shadow. A thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand such like things may Humane Life be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to.

                     <l>A Dream, a Bubble, Ice, a Flower, and Glass:</l>

                  <p>Poor miserable Mortals! what Riches do we seem to heap, what Honours do we invest our selves withal, what Pleasures do we seem to enjoy? yet all these are but a Dream, how short, and how vain? They have slept out their sleep, and all the Men whose hands were <note place="margin">Psal. 76. ver. 5.</note> mighty have found nothing. O Men, you dreamt that you were happy and blessed; but of all those things which ye had, which ye hoped for, what do ye retain? These were the Dreams of those that waked, and the meer Toys of Dreamers. Now punishment opens your Eyes, that Sin shut before.</p>

Life therefore what is it? I will tell ye in short. The time of Humane Life is a Point; Nature, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy: Sense, Obscurity: The whole Body, a composure easily corrupted. The Mind, a Rover; Honour, Smoak; Riches, Thorns; Pleasures, Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. And in a word, all things pertaining to the Body, a River; all things belonging to the Mind, a Dream. Life is a warfare; and the Habitation of a Stranger in a Forreign Land; the Shop of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Miseries. Fame after Death, Oblivion. According to <hi>Ausonius.</hi>

                  <p>ALL Life is a Comedy. VVe are the Actors! One plays a King; another a Beggar. One takes upon him the Person of a Prince, another of a Physician, another of a Husbandman. VVhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever part God has imposed upon us, that we ought decently to perform. Neither does the praise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in this, for thee to act an Emperor or a Duke. VVhatever part thou acts, thou shalt win applause, so thou performedst it well. VVhich is the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable admonition of <hi>Epictetus.</hi> Remember, saith he, that the Actor is to be the Actor of such a part as the Composer pleases. If he would have thee act a Beggar, be sure to represent that person inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously. So do, if thou art to act a Lame person, a Prince, or a Plebeian. This is thy Duty to play thy part well; but it is the business of another to chuse it.</p>

                  <p>Therefore we must not take notice, what we now are, but what we are to be, when we have put off our Vizards and our Habits. Nor matters it whether we take up the part of the first or last Actor, so we act well.</p>

VVhile he clings to the Tree, contemning his past danger, he sees two Mice, the one white, the other black, gnawing the Root of the Tree, and now got as far as the very Pith. Then looking into the Ditch, he spies at the bottom a terrible Dragon breathing Fire. Lastly, casting his Eyes about, he spies the Heads

                  <p>This is that which most deserves our Tears, and which they never can sufficiently wash away; that none of us seriously considers, that there is a time when we must leave this Habitation.

Our Frailty seldom pierces deep into our Minds: Nor do we observe how much time has slid away; but as if it were, out of an inexhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible Stock; we trifle away so many Hours, so many Days, so many Months, and so many Years.

                  <p>MOst truly said <hi>Annaeus, There is no Life but what is short.</hi> For if we regard the Nature of Things; the Lives of <hi>Nester</hi> and <hi>Statilia</hi> were short, who caus'd it to be writ upon her Tomb, That she liv'd Ninty-nine Years.

Not without cause there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the greatest of Physicians exclaims: We un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not how our Life passes, but we perceive it is stoln away. The Space of Time granted to us, flies with such a swift and rapid Motion, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be some few, Life forsakes some as it were in the very Cradle. We have but a little time, and the most part of that we trifle away in Sloth and Luxury. O improvident <hi>Mortals!</hi> the Body which we bear about us, is not a Mansion, but an Inne, which is to be left, when thou art burdensom to the Master of the House. Therefore O Christian,

make haste to live piously, and believe every Day to be so many Lives: He that shall so prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, shall securely dare Death; no Man shall die ill, that lives well.</p>

                  <p>WE are not to strive to live long, but so long as is sufficient, that life is sufficient, which is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd. That life is fulfill'd, when any man passes from his own into the divine Will, and well employs that little time which is allotted him. What does four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score years avail that man that idly spends them? He did not live, but was dead while he lived Nor did he die late, but every day; for to live impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and wickedly, is not to live ill, but to die daily: But thou sayest, he lived fourscore years; but consider from what day thou reck'nst his death. Another is snatch'd away flourishing in the midst of his course; but he had done the duty of a good Man and a good Christian; though his Age were imperfect, his Life was perfect: The other numbred fourscore years, certainly he did not live so long, but he was in being, unless thou wilt say, he lived in the same manner as Trees are said to live. Life is to be measured by the Act and Offices of Vertue. not by Time; therefore let us praise and place him in the number of the Happy, who well employed that life he had; the Just shall remain in eternal remembrance; the memory of the just with praises: For he saw the true light; he was one of many; and he lived, and now lives in Heaven. Why enquirest thou how long he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; he liv'd to Immortality, he has out-stript Ages, and erected, his own Remembrance: And
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:52526:170"/>
as a body of mean stature may be perfect, so in a lesser space of time a life may become perfect. Happiness is not fixt in diuturnity of time, but in Vertue; neither is he that sings oftenest to the Harp, but he that sings best is to be commended. While thou art only in being, 'tis anothers; When thou art a good Christian, it is thy own; That re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire from thy self, that thou mayst not measure out thy Time ignobly in Vice; so to lead thy life, that thou mayst not be carried beyond the Mark. Thou demandest what is the utmost space of Life? to live to true Wisdom; to confirm thy Will in all things to the Will of God, is the truest wisdom. When we die, 'tis not the longest but the chiefest end concerns us. Death walks over all, nor is it any very long space that we precede one another, He that kills, follows the slain; 'tis the least thing of which we are most sollicitous about: For what is it to the purpose how long thou shunnest what cannot be avoided? The best life is not the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, but the most upright.</p>

Heaven nor to God. How much time does our Meals, our Recreation, our Play, our Discourse, our Sleep, our Idleness takes up? How much do litigious Suits and Diseases snatch from us? How many Thieves do steal away our Lives, while we perceive not what we lose? The following Verses, though not so terse and neat, very lively express our Madness.</p>

                     <l>A man lives fourscore years, not often more,</l>
                     <l>Of which in meat and drink some half a score;</l>
                     <l>In play as many, twenty years in sleep,</l>

For we lay not hold upon time to stop the fleetest thing in Nature; but let it slip as a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous thing and easie to be recovered. What keeper of time so sparing, that may not find some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worthy to exchange with his time? We trifile with the most precious of all things, and there is no reckoning made of that which cannot be sufficiently valued. Like them that sleep in Ships, who are driven along by the Winds, though they perceive not the motion, and when they wake. wonder to see themselves ready to be landed, Thus the course of our life hastens away, while we sleep and neglect the inestimable price of Time. When we should wake for a better life, we admire to see our selves at our Journeys end; Death is to many, as the Harbour to the Sailer, he sails well that does not Shipwrack in the Port.</p>

                  <p>WE delay and put off every thing unless it be Vice, which for the most part takes up our whole time. In other things we are always more full of Promises, and say to oue selves, to Morrow this shall be done; the next Week I will not fail to repent; next Year I intend to lead a new life. Thus Days, Months and Years slide away, while we procrastinate, while we promise, and never stand to our Promises. Excellently <hi>Seneca;</hi> Thou shalt hear, saith he, most people saying, At Fifty I intend to retire, at Sixty I intend to give over Business: And whom dost thou take for Surety of thy longer life? Who will warrant things to pass, as thou disposest them?

                  <p>O Mortals, Over-late is to Morrow's life, live to day; pay your Salary to day; mourn for your Sins to day, for who has assured ye of to morrow?

Person with the hopes of a longer Life, gives this Admonition. As he that is carried out of Prison to the Gallows, though the way be longer, yet fears not the Gallows the less, because he comes to it a little the later; and though his Limbs are firm, his Eyes quick, his Lungs sound, and that he relish his Meat and Drink, yet this is still his Affliction, that he <hi>is upon his Journey:</hi> Thus are we all carried to the Gibbet of Death, we are all upon the way, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly parted by some little Intervals.

Offices, have employed themselves in this one thing to the last, that they might know how to live. But many of these, confessing they had not learnt their Lesson, have departed this Life. But how shall they know this that never endeavouted to learn? Most Mortals care not for living well, but for living long. Some then begin to live when they are ready to leave the World. Hence it is that we are empty of all those Comforts, which we desire at the end of our Lives; fearful of death, and ignorant of living. VVhoever then desires to learn the Art of living, let him first learn the Art of dying. Perhaps, some may think that needless to be learnt, which is but once to be made use of. Therefore, it is, that we are with all diligence to apply our selves to this Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: For that is always to be learnt, of which, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we know it or no, we can never make the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment.

                  <p>St. <hi>Austin,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hippo,</hi> went to visit another Bishop of his Familiar Acquaintance lying in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity; to whom, as he was lifting up his Hands to Heaven, to signifie his Departure. St. <hi>Austin</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, That he was a great support of the Church, and worthy of a longer Life; to whom the sick Person made this answer. <hi>If never,</hi> 'twere ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, but if at any time, why not now?</p>
                  <p>Death calls upon all Men alike. Thither we must all come sooner or later; of that we are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; we doubt not of that thing, but of the time. VVhat then? Does not he seem to be the most fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and imprudent Creature of all, who with so much earnestness desires the delay of Death. Would not he be the Laughing-stock of others, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Condemned among many, should beg to be the last Executed? Yet this is the Folly we are guilty of. We think it a great happiness to die last. The Capital Punishment is destined to all, and by a most just determination. Now what matters it, whether we go out first or last, out of this Life, as Men go out of a Theater. We must depart, it then at any time, why not now. To day perhaps Death spares us: That's nothing, to Morrow he will be with thee. The Sword will seize thee; a Stone waits for thee, a Fever lyes in Ambush. Thou art never nor in no place safe. There's a necessity of going. If then to Morrow, why not to Day? If at any time, why not now!</p>

                  <p>DEath is the same to all Men, but the Wages by which it happens are various. One expires while he is feeding, another slumbering falls into an Eternal Sleep, another in the act of Impiety ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguishes. Here one drops by the Sword, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Drowns in Water; another Fires consumes. Some by the sting of Serpents die, while others are Buried in the sudden fall of Ruins. Others by the Contraction of their Nerves are tortured to Death. Others are cut off in their Youth, others in their Cradles. Sometimes an Infant comes into the World to take its farewel of Life. The Exit of some is milder, of others harsher. But how mild and gentle Death may seem to be, however it brings something of Horrour with it, and that for this reason, because it seems to deprive us of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Happinesses, and to take us from that plenty to which we are accustomed. This love of our selves, and desire of self-preservation, is the Chain that clogs us. There is also a natural fear of darkness, to which Death is thought to be our Conductor; which has engaged the Wits of many to augment the Terrours of Death.</p>
                  <p>But that which most augments the fear of Death is this, that present things we know, whither we are to go we know not, and therefore are afraid. Therefore is the Mind to be enured by much Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, that it may not be afraid of that Eternity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which we are to enter. Eternity is that we are to think upon day and night, as they that would bring themselves to endure hunger, must enure themselves to fasting by little and little: So the Soul that is to be translated from this inconstant
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:52526:176"/>
World to a stable Kingdom, must accustom it self to endure Eternity. Let it every day salute the Gate of Eternity, every Moment believe that it waits there: Whatever it acts, let it act for Eternities sake; and only observe this one form of action. I read, I write, I paint, I meditate, I watch, I speak, and all for the sake of Eternity. Whoever aspires to Eternal Triumphs, let him learn to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat Eternity.</p>

This Person recited upon the Stage, a play that he had newly made. But when he was moving the more sprightly Affections in his third Act, a sudden shower scattered the Auditory. Thereupon he promised the rest the next day. The next day a vast multitude met together, in so much that the Theater was thronged; but no <hi>Philemon</hi> came. Some blam'd the slowness of the Poet, others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused him. But at last tyred with expectation, and sending to seek him, the Messengers found him dead in his Bed. His Book was in his Hand; and his Eyes fix'd upon his Book. So that the Messengers stood a while astonished at so sudden an Accident, and the Miracle of so lovely a Death. Returning to the people, they related, that they expected <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon</hi> had finished his last act at Home; leaving the World to give him their last farewel and plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite;

                  <p>If we look at this present Life, the most wish'd for death is, to die, not fearing death: But much more desireable is it, to die in action, and to be busie at our work, that death it self may not prove idle. It was the wish of <hi>Cyprian</hi> the Martyr to be slain for the sake of God, while he was discoursing of God. It is a high Encomium for any Man, that not only the Devil, but neither Death himself should find him idle.</p>

There is no reason to grieve or weep, when we cease to be what we were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be. Is it because thou wouldst have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny steps to thy Death that thou buildest thy self so high a Gibbet; and is it because thou wouldst take a slow prospect of thy Funeral, that thou desirest so many years? Alas thou art to go either to day or to morrow.</p>

                     <hi>Tobias</hi> the worthy Son of a most worthy old Man, but old himself, attain'd to the Ninety ninth year of his Age. Yet when Ninety nine years were expir'd in the fear of God, they Buried him with joy. Could <hi>Tobias,</hi> in our judgment, Exposlulate with God or complain. Why Lord, dost thou now break off my Life? Why didst not thou permit me to make up the full hundred? What other Answer would God return? It so pleas'd me: Now die,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:52526:178"/>

Wherefore do ye pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend immature Age? Wherefore do ye expect a Truce? Wherefore do ye think upon delay? Thou were ripe for Death long before: But grant thee thy own time, thou wilt be never the more ready or the more prepar'd. After all thou wilt desire delay, the more thou stay'st, perhaps the less pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd. Delay has made many the worse. 'Tis a bad preparation for Death, to be unwilling to die. He has perform'd half of the Act who now is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. The desire of Death is to be shaken off, and thou art to learn, that it matters not when thou sufferest whatever it behoves thee to suffer. How well thou hast lived, is the main business, not how long; and often it happens well, when there is no delay. Therefore lay all hankering thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side; and thus resolve with thy self, whatever God pleases let that be done.</p>

                     <hi>CAunus,</hi> is a Town in <hi>Caria,</hi> in a Pestilent Air, and unwholesom for the Inhabitant. These People when <hi>Stratonicus</hi> the Musician, and witty Man, beheld, he recited the Verse in <hi>Homer</hi> to them.
<q>
                        <l>Like as the Leaves, just so the People are.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thereby he taunted their Icterical, Yellowish and Wan Complexions. But when the <hi>Caunians</hi> had given him a very rugged Entertainment for defaming their City, as sickly and unwholesom, <hi>Stratonicus</hi> return'd upon them again; <hi>Must I not dare,</hi> said he, <hi>to call that a sickly place, where the dead walk?</hi> More wittily and more smartly than before.</p>
                  <p>But why do we deny, and lift up our Noses? We are most like to Leaves. Very plainly <hi>Job; Wilt thou break a Leaf,</hi> saith he, <hi>driven to and fro.</hi> As if he had said; When I am but a Leaf, liable to all the Inconveniences of Life, afraid of every Gust, wilt thou hasten me with the wind of thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation? I shall fall of my self, without any constraint of thine. Are not Men Leaves, whom

                        </gap>, things like shadows, frail, unsledg'd, living but the Life of one day.</hi> Certainly we are Leaves, shaken by every puff of wind. Sometimes a little Fever; what do I say? Nay a little Cough, a little drop falling upon the little wicket of the Throat, morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies this Leaf, and throws it into the Grave.</p>
                  <p>But whether or no is Sickness a Benefit, and Death an Evil? No, Mortal, no; it is not, saith <hi>Epictetus. Health well us'd is a good thing; ill us'd, a mischief:</hi> And therefore we may reap Benefit by Sickness. What dost thou say of Sickness? I wil shew thee its Nature; then I shall be quiet, I shall think my self well dealt with, I shall not flatter the Physician, I shall not wish for Death. What wouldst thou more? Whatever thou shalt give me, that will I make happy, prosperous, honourable, to be desir'd. But there are some that deny this, and say, <hi>Take heed of being sick, 'tis an ill thing.</hi> To them <hi>Epictetus</hi> again, <hi>That is as much as to say,</hi> saith he, <hi>Take heed that thou dost not feign three to be four, 'tis an ill thing. How evil? If we so think of it as we ought. What harm will it do me? Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will it not do me good? If therefore I so think of Poverty, Sick, or Troubles of Church or State, as I ought, is not that enough to me, will it not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Truth, Love thee, O <hi>Epictetus,</hi> How agreeable are all these things to Christian Doctrine? This Foundation being laid we shall here teach ye to be mindful of Death in Sickness, and not to be afraid of his coming.</p>

What I was, when born, I know; a weak frail body, liable to all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, the Food of Sickness, the Victim of Death.

                     <p>Must I then now be sick? The time is come for me to try my self. The couragious Man does not shew himself either in Battel or at Sea. There is a Courage also in the Bed of Sickness: Shall I leave a Feaver, or that me? We cannot always continue together: Hitherto I enjoyed Health, now my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness is with Sickness. Sickness I know is the first Messenger of Death. I believe St. <hi>Gregory</hi> for that, who truly and piously; <hi>The Lord knocks,</hi> saith he, <hi>when by the anguish of Sickness, he declares the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Death; to whom we presently open, if we receive him with Affection.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The very <hi>Fables</hi> teach me to receive this first Messenger of <hi>Death</hi> with a contented Mind. They relate, how that an old Man lay sick, and when <hi>Death</hi> was ready to snatch him away, the sick-man desired that he would defer the fatal blow awhile,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:52526:182"/>
till he made his Will, and prepared such other things as were necessary for so long a Journey. To whom <hi>Death; Fond Banquet for the Grave,</hi> said he, <hi>couldst thou not prepare in so many Years; that hast had so many warnings from me already?</hi> To whom the old Man; I take thy Truth to witness, I never had any warning from thee. To whom <hi>Death</hi> reply'd; Now I find old men will lye: A hundred, nay a thousand times I have admonished thee, when I took away not only thy equal in years, but also young Men, Children, Infants, while thou lookst and wepst: But I appeal to this Truth, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful old man, did I not forewarn thee, when thy Eyes grew dim, thy Hair waxed grey, thy Ears grew deaf, all thy proud Senses defective, and thy whole Body wasted? These were my Messengers, these knockt at thy Doors, but thou wouldst not be spoken with; thou wert often and daily warn'd, I can stay no longer, come and go along with me. He ill prepares himself for <hi>Death,</hi> who prepares so late.</p>

                  <p>NO Man ever govern'd his Life well, but he that contemned it. VVe are not so silly, but that we understand we must one day die; yet when Death approaches, we hang back, we tremble, we lament: But would not he appear to thee a very Fool, that should weep because he had not lived a thousand years before? These things are well coupled, thou neither wert, nor will be: thou art ordain'd for that point of time wherein thou liv'st, with that thou mayst extend, how far wouldst thou prolong? Why weepest thou? what is it thou wouldst have? thou losest thy labour: Thou shalt go thither, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all things created go. What is there that thou canst call a Novelty? Thou wert born under this Law: This hapned to thy Father, to thy Ancesters, to all before thee, and will happen to all that come after thee. It is established and decreed; <hi>Death</hi> seizes upon all; we are born to die. Consider in thy Mind the vast throng of those that went before thee, of those that are to follow thee, and those that are to go along with thee. Many thousands of Men and Creatures at this very moment that then fearest to die, are now making several and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:52526:184"/>
various <hi>Exits</hi> out of this World. Take a view of the whole World; the new, the unknown: Most certain it is, that every moment Millions are born and die, and many die the same death. Now couldst thou think that thou shouldst never come to that end, to which thou art always going. <hi>Death</hi> is a safe Road to Rest; neither is there any thing of evil in <hi>Death,</hi> but only the fear of <hi>Death:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we would live quietly, the Soul must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready. Shall I fear my end, when I know I must have an end? when I know that all things have their end? Shall I fear my last gasp, that puts an end to all my Sighs? Why should I fear to restore that which I received upon that condition? But you will say, it is a difficult thing to contemn <hi>Death.</hi> 'Tis <hi>Death,</hi> but to him that knows how to <hi>Live.</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>He that his hours on Vertue doth expend,</l>
                        <l>Neither doth wish for, nor yet fears his end.</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>We do not deny, but that there is something ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible in <hi>Death;</hi> there we must learn, not to be afraid of it. No Man learns to be contented upon a Bed of Roses, to sit down at a Banquet; but this to be exercised, not to give way to Grief. He chearfully embraces <hi>Death,</hi> who has long composed himself to wait for it: And this is the greatest Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of a generous Mind, not to fear thy depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For he knows whither he shall go, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members from whence he came. Such a person was <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Emperour, of whom Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brojs</hi> was wont to say, <hi>I loved the man, whom when he died, was more grieved for the state of the Church, than for his own Condition.</hi> Therefore do thou make it thy business not to fear <hi>Death.</hi>

                     </gap>her sweet Wood; and having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his usual exercise of Running, he ascended the Pile, and stood Crown'd upon the heap of Wood; the Sun whom he Ador'd, shining all the while. Which done, he gave the <hi>Macedonians</hi> a Sign to kindle the Pile: Which being now all of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:52526:185"/>
a light Fire, <hi>Calanus</hi> wrapt up in Flames, stood still unmov'd, till he fell as the heap fell, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd in the midst of the Ashes. <hi>Alexander,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring the Courage of the Man, is reported to have said, <hi>That</hi> Calanus <hi>had vanquish'd more Potent Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies than he.</hi> For <hi>Alexander</hi> had wag'd War with <hi>Prous, Taxilus</hi> and <hi>Darius;</hi> but <hi>Calanus</hi> with La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Death. Shall the vain Heathens shew so much Courage in Death, and Christians, trusting in God, be afraid and tremble? Death is not an evil, but the fear of Death is an evil. Let us, I beseech ye, examine things themselves, and not the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things. If we believe <hi>Seneca,</hi> Death is the best Invention of Nature, the Remedy of all Evils. Why therefore do we fear at last? Immortal Peace, Eternal Joy will entertain us. Let us take Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage from the despair of longer Life. Make that a Vertue, which would be necessity. Certainly a prudent Christian does nothing unwillingly; he avoids all necessity, because he wills what that would compel him to. Let us therefore do wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, what we cannot but do. Let us with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Mind expect our end, or rather our begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.

Let us not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the shortness of our Lives, nor the incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of our Health: For we wast our Health, and our Lives, with Giuttony and Drinking, never thinking our selves satisfied, till our cramm'd Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies be as hard as a Drum. Ridiculous, yea, Mad Men, we shorten our Lives by those things, which ought to lengthen it. But that proceeds from this, because we will not be perswaded, that Abstinence has so great a power to prolong Life. But daily experience tells us, that the saying is true; so much food as you spare, so many days you add. But to the Business.</p>

Behold how they, who are subject to the power of another, being commanded a long Journey, pack up their things in haste, sollicitous and sad; how they murmur because they had no longer warning. As they are upon their departure they often look back, pretending this and t'other Obstacle.

Thus it will happen to all unwary People, that want fore-sight. Foresight is necessary in all things, especially in those things that are never to be done but once; where one mistake draws a thousand along with it. This is the Condition of Death, one Error causes a thousand Mistakes. To err once there, is to perish eternally. O blind Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, it will happen to you, as it happens to them that shut their Eyes against their Enemies Swords, in a Battle, as if they were not to feel the danger which they see not. Ye shall be smitten, ye shall die, ye shall be sensible, and feel the stroke; but whether blind or seeing, that is at your choice. You refuse to think upon Death which you must shortly think upon and feel. The sufferance would soon follow when the Consideration precedes.</p>

                  <p>NEither is there any Question to be made of this. They chiefly fear to die, who know not how to live; who believe no other Happiness but that of the Body. Who only know how to eat well, drink well, and sleep well, and place all their Heaven in pleasure; persons certainly most obedient, but to their Bellies, not to the Divine Will. Of whom St. <hi>Gregory</hi> truly said, <hi>They know not what the Celestial Souls desire, who set their Hearts upon Earthly Delights.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A prudent Christian, that takes no more care of the Body than of a mean and abject Slave, looks upon Death no otherwise than a Morning depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of a dark, unpleasant and incommodious Inn. Whoever thou art thou canst not fear thy Exit as of this Life, if thou hopest to enter into the other. Thy fear arises from hence. For though there are many causes vulgarly given of this fear; yet they all vanish upon the hopes of a more bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Life. He who seriously aspires to Heaven fears not these Baubles. To such a Man, Labour, Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Grief, Contempt, Ignominy, Loss, Servitude, Poverty, Old Age, are nothing else but the School of Experience, the Time of Patience, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Victory.</p>

                  <p>IN almost all Sickness three things are hardly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, <hi>Fear of Death,</hi> Pain of the Body, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:52526:188"/>
from Pleasure. But as hot Diseases are Cur'd by cold, cold by hot Medicines, so are they Cur'd by their own Antidotes. Therefore the fear of Death is to be Cur'd by Love, but by Divine Love; a little Dose of Divine Love will dispel the fumes of vain fear. He that loves Christ will the less love Life; and shall perceive the love of Christ to him.
<q>
                        <l>—By words alone this is not prov'd,</l>
                        <l>Love, <hi>Marcus,</hi> love if thou wouldst be belov'd.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Pain of the Body is to be asswag'd by tranquility of Conscience. A guiltless Mind is a wonderful Consolation to the Sick. And indeed a pure Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is a potent remedy against all Torments. That also asswages pain, as St. <hi>Gregory</hi> intimates in these words. <hi>More easily will the Sick Person en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure pain, if he bear but this in his mind.</hi>

Those which leave, are vain, short, and filthy, and before they are forsaken frequently leave their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers; those which we promise our selves, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense, Stable and Eternal.

On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, Sickness is the Slaughter-house of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to some, and the School of Vice; while they are well, they are mad. While they are well, they

have a hundred Businesses; the Business of God is their last care. How many are Chaste, while they are Sick; when they recover they return to their former filthy Lusts. Such people would do better Sick, to whom health is so dangerous. These therefore God tyes them to the Bed of Sickness, that they may be at leisure to themselves, and may mind their Salvation: Forsake Vanity and look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Heaven. Sickness intangles the Body in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Miseries, but frees the Soul from as many.

                  <p>SIckness exhorts to Parcimony; disswades from Lust, and is the Mistress of Modesty. Do thou lay aside all Care, whatever happens to the Body thou art safe, to the Mind be in health. For the sickness of the Body has been of great advantage in many to the health of the Soul. That sublime per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son rais'd from nothing, from the Water below, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated to the Stars, who keeps the Keys of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, whose only shadow expell'd the Distempers and Diseases of the Body; being once ask'd why he suffer'd his own Daughter to lye under the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of a violent Disease? made answer, <hi>It is convenient for her.</hi> How knowest thou but that it may be as convenient for thee? The same Person,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:52526:189"/>
when he found his Daughter might be safely Cur'd, recover'd her, and made her fit to Cure others. Do thou also take care that thy health may do thee good, and perhaps thou shalt recover. Lastly, take care of thy Soul above all things, and offer it up to the Heavenly Physician to be Cur'd. And as to what remains, hope if not for what is needful for, yet for what is convenient fot thee. Sickness is a very unpleasant Companion, but a faithful, which often pulls ye by the Sleeve, and admonishes thee of thy condition. A faithful Admonisher is a most certain fafeguard in danger. If the Sickness be remediless, be silent and rejoice, for that thou shalt be the sooner free from a loathsom and ruinous Prison.

Therefore let the sick person labour to avoid infinite Miseries, while so impatiently endures the Bitternesses here; let him learn by pains not long lasting to avoid pains Eternal, which neither Pothecary nor Physician, no Drug nor Herb, not Death it self can Cure. There are several ways to Death; but, but one to Eternity.</p>

                  <p>Some Remedies are made out of some Poysons, and oft-times a small and present pain admonishes us to prevent the approach of Excessive pains that threaten to twinge us: And that which was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome became profitable. Thus every Disease the more it perplexes and torments us, the more it admonishes us of Eternity, either in perpetual Joy or Misery. Let the healthy take care, let the sick be mindful whither they go.

                     <hi>ZEm</hi> the Son of <hi>Demius,</hi> having consulted the Oracle to know how he might lead the best Life, had this answer given him.

To dwell among Books, being to live among the dead. And this familiarity with the dead is the best Life. But it is the same madness to lay before the Sick whole Libraries, and huge Volumes, as to set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them full Meals of Flesh. A little Broth or a small Sallet must serve them, so a little Book is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for them for several Months: However still something is to be read to the Sick, if the Disease and Pain will give leave, but they are to be read as they eat. What they eat, they do not presently swallow, but chew first. So what they read, they must not carelesly pass over, but they are to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:52526:190"/>
and as it were to weigh every little sentence. Otherwise to read is to neglect. But let the Sick Mans only Book be <hi>Christ Crucified.</hi> Let him read that Book continually, wherein he will find as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Comforts, as Words and Wounds.</p>

                  <p>SO I say we must always pray in sickness. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this a thing of any great difficulty to a sick person. For either with his Tongue if he have strength enough, may he pronounce his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God. Or if his Tongue be numm'd, or that his voice be intercepted by weakness, a suppliant Mind is to be lifted up to Heaven, while the Body lyes quiet, but only for some ardent groans that distinguish these private Colloquies with God in Sickness. But there is also a sort of Sickness that does not only interrupt the voice, but even op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses the very Soul it self: But then Patience and Suffering are to be offered up for Prayers to God, to whom Pain is a grateful Sacrifice, so that Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be joined with it. He prays well, who suffers well. Neither may he be said to pray, but to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by Prayer of God, who sends such Eloquent Messengers to him as <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Patience.</hi> But let him be such a sick person, whose Speech may be interrupted, whose Mind may be broken, and whose Patience may be at a loss. Yet there is a way for him to pray. Let him look about, he shall see some sitting, some standing by him, ready to help and assist him. How easie is it then to cast in a word by the by; how easie is it for him to point or cry to his Friend, say this Prayer, read this Psalm, or that Paragraph. Who so hard-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as to deny so small a Duty to the Sick? So
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:52526:191"/>
that when a sick person cannot pray with his own, he may with anothers Lips. And therefore I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat this again, <hi>Pray always in Sickness.</hi> We can never unseasonably have recourse to God.</p>

Mind pray. Never begin the Night, nor compose thy self to sleep, till thou hast examined thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: In the day-time when thy pain ceases or relaxes, take a good Book, and there read and weigh every Period; every Day set aside a small Hour for Prayer, pious Groans, and humble Ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; so thou wilt believe thy self to have pray'd an Hour in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>At the beginning and end of all thy Prayers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thy self wholly to the will of God with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Obedience. All which things are so far from difficulty, that a dying man may perform them, as well as he whose Pain is not so severe. If thou canst not, or rather will not perform these Duties, yet for that one little Hour patiently endure thy Pains: Make not thy Misery more intollerable than it is, nor burthen thy self with Complaints. Pain is the Lighter of Opinion and Conceit, and not to the Weight. On the other side, if thou beginst to exhort thy self, and say, <hi>'Tis nothing, or else it is very little, let us endure, it will be over by and by;</hi> thou wilt make it easie while thou believ'st it so. Every Man is miserable as far as he believes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be so.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Here I seasonably cite to thee the words of the wise <hi>Roman: Being thrown,</hi> saith he, <hi>into this deep and unquiet Sea, flowing with uncertain Tydes, now advancing us with sudden encrease of Riches, now again leaving us upon the barren Sands of greater Losses, we can never stand fixt in any place.</hi> We float up and down, are washt one against another, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we make an absolute Shipwrack, but are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in fear. Neither is there any Port, but that of <hi>Death,</hi> to them that sail in this stormy and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous Ocean.</p>
                  <p>But every Mans Credulity deceives him, and a willing forgetfulness of <hi>Death,</hi> for the sake of those things which he loves. Daily we behold the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals of persons known and unknown, yet we mind other business, and account that unexpected, which was foretold us all our life-time before. 'Tis not the injustice of Nature, but the depravedness of humane Reason that takes it ill to forsake that place, to which it was admitted but of Courtesie, He is unjust who will not leave the disposal of the Gift to him that gave it. And an extream piece of Covetousness it is, not to look upon what a man has received as gain, but what he restores as a loss. Ingrateful is he that calls the end of Pleasure an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury. A Fool, who thinks there is no good but what is present; immediately all pleasure leaves us, and is snatcht away almost before it comes. Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narrow and circumscrib'd are his Joys, who thinks he possesses only what he has and sees. Therefore let us rejoyce for what is given, and restore it when 'tis requir'd <hi>Death</hi> seises upon one at one time, he will pass by none. Therefore let the Soul lie upon the watch, and never be afraid of that
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:52526:193"/>
which will necessarily happen, which is uncertain, and always to be expected. I know not whether it be a greater piece of Folly to be ignorant of that Law of Morality, or more impudent to deny it. All Men, all Creatures look toward their latter end; who ever is born, is destin'd to die, and prepared for an Eternity.</p>

                  <p>A Thief notorious for the murther of several, was taken in the lower <hi>Austria,</hi> and fastned to the Wheel, where his Thighs were first broken, to prolong the Torment of an extraordinary Criminal, for a terrour to others. But this Malefactor shew'd himself a man, and began to be a most Religious Christian in the midst of his Torments; for at every word, he breath'd out nothing but Patience and Repentance. He called upon God continually, implor'd Pardon for his Crimes, and like a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, began to dehort the Standers by from wicked Courses, such as he had taken. By this it grew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:52526:194"/>
Evening, when the Multitude flockt, some as Comforters of so great a Sufferer; though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed only as Spectators of a generous Patience. For he prostrate to his Punishment, that he might find a better Life, asswag'd his present Pain with the Hope of future Happiness; and gave God thanks, who in his Wrath had remembered Mercy, and had chastiz'd him to spare him. But in that slow Torment, which it was thought would have lasted three days, he only pray'd a quick Death to end the Fury of his Pains, or the opportunity of a Shower to asswage his burning Heat and Drought. It was observ'd that he had the Assistance of both; for towards Sun-set there fell a plentiful Shower, and in short, while after his Torments and his Life ended both together.</p>
                  <p>Behold, O Christian, thou hast also thy Wheel, though a more gentle one; thou art ty'd to thy Bed as to that Wheel: And perhaps not only Pain but Drought may afflict thee. Therefore that a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Shower may fall upon thee, cause thy Bed to be made in <hi>Golgotha,</hi> at the foot of that Cross, to which the Saviour of the World was nail'd, from whose Body fell Showers of Blood. There drink, there refresh thy self, there satisfie thy self; being we'lassured that thou shalt be the more perfectly cured, the more largely thou drinkest.</p>

Thus in the Day-time he was exposed to the heat of the Sun, with his Eye-lids distended upward and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. His Head, Hands and Feet were also at the same time anointed with Honey, which brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite swarms of Flies and Wasps to feed upon his bare Flesh, so that the Corruption extending to the enclosed parts, engendred Worms; which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Flies and Wasps made a tedious.

How is thy Disease a matter of nothing to these Torments! Be silent therefore, and preserve thy Patience. He that is a Companion of the Cross, shall be a Companion of Paradise.

seemed to be deferred. So God loved the World. O immense Love, for the fulfilling whereof, one Death was not enough, which before Death, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Life it self to die; so that the most Loving Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, was constrained to perish Limb by Limb, to consume Drop by Drop, and by the slow distilling of his Blood to breath out his Soul several ways: And yet he loved more, than he suffered; and more he desired to endure, than Humane Nature was able to bear. Death seemed to him the slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of his Punishments, nor was it enough for him to die once in <hi>Golgotha,</hi> unless he had died before in <hi>Gethseman.</hi> It had been a small thing for him to have expired between Thieves, had he not reaked before with bloody Sweat, to shew how he had been Scourged. O Christ! As yet the <hi>Roman</hi> Executioner does not appear, the hooked Wyre does not yet tear thy Flesh. The great Nails are not yet driven through thy Hands and Feet, and yet already such plentiful Fountains of Blood flow from thee. What will become of thee to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, when thy whole Body shall be but one Pool, one continued Wound? To day only Rivers, to Morrow Seas of Blood will flow, and this little Bed among the Olives will seem soft in respect of that cruel and severe Lodging upon the Cross.</p>
                  <p>In either of these, O my sick Friend, lay thy self down, and thou wilt presently feel ease from all thy pains. Thou wilt easily bear thy own, when thou considerest the Torments of thy Lord.</p>

Whatever his will is that is mine.</hi> And that he may shew the manner how, in all Humane Affairs the will of God is to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, adding this Moreover. <hi>Always,</hi> saith he, <hi>I chuse to will that which is done. For whatever is done (sin excepted) is done by the will of God.</hi> For which reason this most wise Philosopher admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every Man; never require that those things which are done, should be done according to thy Disposal. But if thou art wise, be content that things are done as they are. He that accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates himself to necessity is wise, and is privy to the Humane Mysteries.</p>

We are Brute Beasts, yea, Stones and Rocks, if our Sences return not to us, upon this bright and resplendent Information of Nature. But let the Rebels to Divine Will hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; let them hear and answer to <hi>Epictetus,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring from them nothing but what is iust. <hi>Shew me,</hi> saith he, <hi>any one who is sick and happy, in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and happy; that dies and is blessed.

                  <p>THere is nothing more dangerous than despair; nor can the Enemy of Salvation find out any thing worse for Man. For all other things are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated by their own Cures. This is the chiefest and the last of Mischiefs, so that when it oppresses the Departing Soul, there is no room for any reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Therefore is it always, especially in the end, more vehemently to be withstood, because it then presses on with greater force, and there is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying such Councils as are fit to be taken for thy Salvation. The neglect of the last Hour is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther irreparable. He shall never rise again, whose fall is deadly there. Therefore at length awake, O sick Man; 'tis better never wake till the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening. What is ill delayed, is worse omitted.

Only do thou make no delay. And though there be no excuse for a slothful delay; yet a late amendment is not without commendation. It is better to repent late than never.

Thou art Born therefore, that thou shouldst lose, that thou shouldst perish, that thou shouldst hope, that thou shouldst fear, that thou shouldst disquiet others and thy self too, that thou shouldst fear and wish for death, and which is more, that thou shouldst never know thy conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor when thou wert safe. Besides that every thing of future is uncertain, only that we are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to decay for the worse; the Journey to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is more easie, when we have dismissed our Thoughts from worldly Conversation.

Cease therefore, O my Soul, to be willing to be miserable, and to consume thy self with so much turmoiling. Painful Beginnings thou wilt say. 'Tis very true. But thou knowst that no days are less quiet than those that are next to rest. No days less Holidays than those that precede Festivals. So it is with thee. But thy rest shall be Eternal. The preparation tires thee, shortly the Paschal without end shall follow. Go to then, and expend a little Labour and Grief. By and by thou shalt behold the Gate, not that which leads out of this Life; but that which leads to Eternity. Then hadst thou but begun to labour, it would prove sufficient, if he for whom thou labourest think it so. Therefore, O my Soul, dismiss vain things to vain people, and turn thee to the Lord who hath rewarded thee. His Mercies toward thee hath been innumerable; thou maist sooner number the Sand of the Sea than them; by which he designs to open thee the way to Heaven. <hi>Bernardus Clarevallensis</hi> recommended this particularly to his Friends, to cast the Anchor of their hope in the safe Bay of Divine Mercy.

were of Childbirth Crucifie me, the Rest and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of another Life is preparing for me; and that the Mercy of God shines over me, either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting Death, or defending my Life. Therefore let not God be delayed through any commiseration of me. For if I die, I shall escape free and secure from my Sins, nor shall I ever any more resist the will of God, as one that has left this Life, and the Inconstancy of Mortals. Yet I am very much afraid of my weakness, left I should faint in the right road, and in my holy purpose. Seeing then that hitherto, through the Mercy and Grace of God, I have remained stedfast in the truth, I would not depart from the Innocency of my Life, though I have a firm hope, that it will never be that I shall contradict the will of God, but rather that I may be always able to attend and wait upon it: Which when God shall be pleased to fulfil in me, I am so far from praying against it, that I shall rather esteem it as a great favour. For when I ought to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be holy, there is nothing which I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive at the hands of the most holy and pure of Spirits, God, that can be harmful, if not rather profitable for me. Come then pains and exercise my patience, as God has given ye leave. To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to die, and not to be in pain, scarce happens to any Man. Through pains we pass to Death. That is the high road. A little while we must be in pain, that we may not be in pain to Eternity.</p>

Thus while the wild Beast moves the snare he is taken. Thus while the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted Birds disorder the Lime-twig, they hang by the Feathers. There is no Yoke so strait that does not less hurt him that bears it willingly than him that resists. There is but one mitigation of terrible pains, which is to suffer, and submit to necessity. Wherefore then dost thou add a Disease of mind to sickness of Body? Making thy self more miserable by murmuring, and provoking him the more thereby, who beholds the Sufferings of Men from above, and considers their Patience, with a design to reward it.</p>
                  <p>But the sick Man objects; thou canst not make me not to feel what I feel. My tender sick Friend, if no where else, at least suffer patience to inhabit in thy Ears. I do not deny pain to be pain, but I say it may be lessened by patience. Which if it take not away all sence of pain, yet it gives thee the Victory over pain, while thou hast strength to endure it manfully. Therefore the Mind is to be roused up, to be armed and embattelled against its Enemies. An unprepared and impatient mind is dejected at the least Misfortunes; like a Coward, that upon the sight of the Enemy throws away his Arms and flies; thus the thought of pain Exani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:52526:202"/>
a sluggish mind, which had it held but out the Buckler of Patience had proved a Victor over pain. Patience not only augments the Courage of the Mind, but mitigates the sharpness of the pain. So that if it be never so violent, however begin then to hope: Excess of pain promises an end. For extremity of Grief is the beginning of Joy. This is the Law of Contraries; the one arises from the conclusion of the other.</p>
                  <p>But are we not ashamed that so many Christian Boys and Girls have joyfully endured what we Men could not bear without weeping and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints?</p>
                  <p>Why tremblest thou? Resume thy Courage; hope in God, the end is at hand. The pains are terrible but short. And it is a Noble thing for a true Christian, neither to give way to pleasure nor to pain.</p>

If pain of the Body at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it, the evil is redoubled, which cannot be endured but by a double portion of patience, as in this Paralytic. He was so indigent that no body would help him into the troubled Waters. No bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy would so much as compassionate his Poverty. Ah. What a hard case it is to be at the same time, both poor and sick? This Mans Disease was not of a Months or a Years standing.

he yet lived. Sick people think a Day a Month, a Month a Year, a Year an Age: How many Ages could this Man but think so many Years? Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his patience, he lost not his meekness of Mind. Neither in this desperate Sickness had he wasted all his hope and patience. He envied no body, he repined at no body, he reproaches no body. He accuses no Man, condemns no Man; wishes no Man his ill Fate. Neither does Curse himself, nor the day of his Birth; nor blame For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, nor his Parents; much less does he murmur against God, complain of Heavens Cruelty, or stand upon his own Innocency; nor does he chide the slowness of Death. Nor does he prepare to make himself away; but patiently expects help, and still hopes; nor is he importunate with Christ, contentedly satisfied that he had only not conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Miseries from his Saviour. Thou, who art sick, canst thou imitate this poor Man? Certainly thou oughtest, or else thou canst not hope for Heaven.</p>

calls to thee from the Cross. Thou passest by this Road of Calvary, when thou art in Distress. But thou dost only pass by, because thy pains, whatever they are, were nothing to this Sea of Grief; they were but Resemblances of Sorrow. His Pain, when Crucified, was real Pain, in whom there was no Part free from Pain. His Bones, his Nerves, his Veins, whatever scaped the Scourge and Thornes, tormented by the extending Engines. Nor is there any that dares afford the least Word to asswage these unspeakable Torments. His weeping Friends, (and how many of them?) Avail nothing, his Fugitive Disciples leave him; his insulting Enemies torment him, and whom they pierced with Nailes, before, now they Stab with Ignominious Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Revilings. The Father himself forsakes the Son in Torments. No Comfort to his Soul, in all this extremity of Anguish. Yet, in the midst of all these Miseries, he never complained, never repined, never made any evil Imprecation, nay, he implored the Pardon of all. He gave as many Documents of Patience, as he received VVounds and Injuries. Behold now and see, if thy Grief be like the Grief of thy Lord, and Saviour.

                  <p>THE Complaints of the Sick are almost innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, they can hardly speak without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring: How often do we hear them cry out, Oh miserable me! Oh afflicted me! Oh who so overwhelm'd in Pain as I am. But they that more narrowly examine the business, will change their Notes, and cry, 'Tis well, 'tis very well, 'tis Gods pleasure: O happy, O blessed me, corrected not by a Tyrant, but by a Father; God be praised; Glory be to God. Heaven reward all my Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors. This is that, my sick Friend, that becomes thee, and behoves thee. <hi>Seneca</hi> admonishing the same thing; <hi>Do not,</hi> saith he, <hi>make thy miseries more grievous to thy self than they are.</hi> Complaints of past Griefs are idle, and these common Sayings; <hi>Never had any man such a time on't:</hi> What Torments, what Miseries did I feel! No body thought I would ever have recovered; and the like. They may be true, but they are past; what signifies it to remember past Troubles, and to be miserable, because thou wert so. Therefore lay aside two things, the Fear of what is to come and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of past Sorrows. Wherefore then dost thou complain in vain, and fester thy Wounds with the Nails of Impatience? I am miserable thou sayst. Rather blessed Humanity is in a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, in regard no man is miserable, but through his own fault. Blessed is the Man whom God cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steneth, for whom he loves he chastiseth. He ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a Wound, and he healeth; he wounds, and his hand maketh whole again. Knowest thou not, that the Wound which the Chirurgeon makes is
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:52526:208"/>
the beginning of the Cure. Do thou therefore nor mind the Wound, but the hand of him that wounds, and thou wilt confess thy self to be much more in health, than when thou wert at the best. But sayst thou, I feel a most vehement pain; No question, if thou endurest it effeminately. But as the Enemy makes the greatest slaughter upon them that flie, so is all pain more heavy to him that succombs under it. But the Torture is intolerable. It is not for the stout to endure slight Pains. Think upon so many hundreds of Couragious Martyrs. <hi>Seneca</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, That there was a certain person, who while the Veins of his Legs were cutting, read in a Book all the while. But sayst thou, My Disease will let me do nothing. How, nothing? Alas it is thy Body that is only infirm and sick, not thy Mind. Therefore if thou beest a Racer, thy Feet are only bound, if a Smith, or other Handicrafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, thy hands are not at liberty. But if thy Mind fail thee not, thou mayst hear, thou mayst learn, thou mayst remember, though sick. What more dost thou believe, thou dost nothing if thou art temperate in sickness? If thou shewest that thy Disease may be overcome, at least endur'd? There is room for Courage in the Bed of Sickness. Thou hast business enough; strive with thy Disease, and thou hast done enough.</p>

She might have said with St. <hi>Bernard.</hi> My Labour is but the labour of one Hour in respect of Eternity, yet if more, I value it not, through my extream love.</p>
                  <p>Therefore my sick Friend, if thou numberest the Days and Years of thy Sickness, call them a Moment: If thy Patience and Constancy out-vye them, hope for the Eternity of the blessed. The Labour is small, the Pain short, the Recompence eternal.</p>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. The Art of Dying well is briefly Taught.</head>
                  <p>NOT to know how to die is the most miserable piece of Ignorance in the World. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we may learn that which we ought to learn all our Lives, there are five things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to good Death.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>A free and undaunted Mind.</hi> This is that which is of chiefest moment, and upon which the rest depend. It is a great satisfaction for our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences so willingly to abandon'd what is most dear to us. Therefore, saith <hi>David,</hi> an Offering of a Free-heart-will I give unto thee. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so acceptable to God nor so profitable to Man, as a free and ready Mind, and a generous Trust in God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>A Will made and Debts discharged.</hi> 'Tis an Errour never to think of a Will till Death is at the Door.</p>
                  <p>Dispose of thy Goods while thou art well in thy Sences. Moreover, as to the giving away of such things as are at our disposal.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. Nine causes why we are to Die with a contented Mind.</head>
                  <p>BEfore all things consider the death of thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and thou wilt fear thy own with a most contented Mind. Compare, I beseech thee, thy Bed to his Cross; thy Pillows to his Thorny Diadem; thy Food with his Gall, thy Drink with his Vinegar; thy Pains with his Torments. Thou didst die in the midst of thy Friends and Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he in the midst of his Enemies and Revilers. Thou among thy Helpers and Assistants; he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd deserted by all. For thy health so many Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines are still prepar'd. His extream thirst wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the refreshment of cold Water. Yet he the Lord and chief of all. Thou a Servant most vile and mean. Him all these Miseries befel both Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and Undeserving; thee for thy Deserts and Impiety. And therefore thou hast no reason to complain.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The chiefest Grace of the Supream King is a <hi>Good Death.</hi> To die well is to avoid the danger of Living ill. But he dies well who dies willingly. Who does not readily rise from a hard Bed? They only desire to lye long, who cherish'd by the heat, are loth to leave a warm Nest. If it be ill with thee in this Life, wherefore shouldst thou not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly pass to a better. If well, 'tis time for thee to make an end, lest Prosperity cast thee as it does many into a late but fatal Ruin. 'Tis a hard thing for the Fortunate to die. How many Men are Condemned to perpetual Torments, who had they dy'd Children or young had gone to Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Saints and all our dearest Friends invite us to them. But, saist thou, we must leave our
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:52526:216"/>
Friends and Companions. Unadvisedly spoken, thou art going to them. Where are thy Parents? Dost not thou hope in Heaven? And that thou shalt also go thither. But these are things uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and only hoped for. Very right there is no Man hopes for what he sees, or is certain of. And therefore God affords thee an occasion for that Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. He commanded thee to hope for Heaven, he would never promise it thee certainly. And yet thou art carried thither still with a certain hope, though to a thing to thee uncertain. A Creditor has no reason to mistrust a Faithful Debtor. God is become thy Debtor. Consider thou to whom thou art a Creditor. Doth not St. <hi>Paul</hi> cry out with joy, I know whom I have believed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Consider, O Man of little Soul the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary alacrity of Mind, and the ardent desire to die of many Martyrs, who contemn'd all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations of Death, and suffered the severest Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with a smiling Countenance. Certainly nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Death nor Labour is terrible, but the fear of Death or Labour. Therefore let us applaud the saying of him, who said, <hi>Death is no evil, but to die shamefully.</hi> Children are frighted with Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goblins for want of knowledge. What is Death? A Hobgoblin: Turn the Argument, and thou shalt find it so. Yet neither Children nor Infants, nor Madmen fear Death; and therefore 'tis a most shameful thing that reason should not afford us that security which reason produces. Death is a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute and a Duty to be paid by all, why then art thou troubled? Why dost thou not pay the Debt thou owest; for Death allows no priviledges: No Man was ever exempted, or shall be. <hi>The World,</hi> saith St. <hi>Basil, is Mortal, and the Region of them that die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:52526:217"/>
5. What is a long fear of Death but a long Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Dost thou live long? Thou art long in Torment. Well said <hi>Tertullian, That is not to be fear'd that frees us from all fear.</hi> But thou wilt say, 'Tis a terrible thing in Sickness to foresee Death creeping on by degrees. Worm of a Man, what wouldst thou have? Did not thy Saviour Christ foresee his Death, and that a most sharp one, for thirty years and more? Art thou better than he? But because thou dost not so much fear Death, as the previous Inconveniences of Death, hear <hi>Epicte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, And shalt not thou,</hi> saith he, <hi>depart with a firm and constant mind, but trembling and cowardly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of thy fine Cloaths, or thy gaudy Silver Plate?</hi> Unhappy Man! Was it thus that hitherto thou hast lost all thy time? What if I prove Sick? Thou shalt be honestly Sick. Who shall Cure thee? God. I shall lye hard. But as a Man. I shall not have a convenient House. 'Tis an inconvenience to be Sick. What shall be the issue of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease? Nothing but Death. Therefore dost not thou believe that the Fountain of all Evil, is the chief mark of a degenerate and dastardly Mind, is not so much death it self as the fear of Death. Therefore exercise thy self against it; make use of whatever thou hearest or readest, as weapons to Encounter it. So shalt thou know there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way for Man to gain his own Liberty.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. From how many Evils art thou freed by Death. To die is to shut up the Shop of all Miseries. Excellently well said <hi>Pliny. That is the condition of Life, that Death becomes the Heaven for the best of Men, and the chief benefit of Nature.</hi> And therefore let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one provide himself of this as one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Cures for his Mind, that of all the Benefits which Nature affords Men, there is none better than a seasonable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Death. <hi>Caesar</hi> in <hi>Salust</hi> affirms
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:52526:217"/>
Death to be a Cessation from Misery to the afflicted and no Torment. Therefore the Wise Man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways considers what manner of Life he led, and not how long. For Nature provided us a place to Lodge and Sojourn in but not to inhabit, lends us the use of Life, like that of Money, are not payable at a certain day. Why then dost thou complain if she call it in when she pleases; since she lent it upon that condition.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Prison Doors are set open by Death; and dost thou fear to go forth. Rather rejoice: Hitherto thou wert a Captive, now thou shalt be free. How foolish a thing it is to depend upon Hope, or Happiness, and be afraid to go at large to that which always remains, and to change for a moment of dying a perpetual Immortality. The Prison is open, haste thee to a better place.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Death is the way; yea, it is the Gate that leads us into our Countrey, to Eternal Life, to Immortal Joy. For Death is not so much the end of Life as the beginning of Life. Learnedly said St. <hi>Bernard.</hi> The Just Man dies but securely, whose death as it is the Exit out of this present Life, is the Entry into a better. But thou wilt say, To live long how pleasant a thing it is; but how uncertain is it whether Divine Grace will not forsake thee before thy Sin. And who is there that has not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reason to be afraid for his perseverance, which no holiness of Life can merit. 'Tis a Gift, and given gratis. Therefore he that desires this Gift let him reconcile himself to the Giver.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. But the Reason of Reasons is the Will of God, whose Eternal pleasure it was that thou shouldst yield to Nature at this time, in this place, and through this Disease. What wouldst thou more? It was Gods will; it so seem pleasing to God. This is that will, that can will no evil. Therefore the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:52526:218"/>
Son of <hi>Syrack</hi> gives this advice; <hi>Humble thy self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou beest sick, and while thou maist sin, shew thy Conversation.</hi> But all these Reasons I do short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sum up thus.</p>

                  <p>THerefore do willingly, O Christian, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise thou wouldst be forc'd to do unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly. VVhat is done by a willing Mind becomes light, and ceases to be necessity where the will takes place. The wise Man is so instructed as to consent to what he cannot withstand. Therefore I am secure and fear nothing. Nature a most kind Parent, never made any thing terrible. 'Tis only the Error of Men that makes Death formidable. VVe are afraid of Death, not because it is evil, but because it is not known to Men. If thou art re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving any thing sublime in thy Mind; if thou art rearing any high or lofty structure despise those low and poor mistakes of the Vulgar, and admire those Precepts whose imitation leads thee the true way to Glory. VVe have innumerable Examples of those that die happily and cheerfully. Rather imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him among the Ancients that made this Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue between himself and the Minister of Death. <hi>Thou shalt die.</hi> Since the Fall 'tis the Nature not
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:52526:218"/>
so much the punishment of Man, <hi>Thou shalt die.</hi> Upon this condition I came into the VVorld. <hi>Thou shalt die.</hi> 'Tis the Law of Nations to repay what has been borrow'd. <hi>Thou shalt die.</hi> Life is a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, when thou hast travell'd as far as thou hast design'd, thou must return home again. <hi>Thou shalt die.</hi> I thought thou wouldst have told me some News, I came for this purpose. As soon as I was Born Nature set me my Bounds. VVhy should I be offended? <hi>Thou shalt die.</hi> 'Tis a vain thing to fear what I cannot avoid: He that stays the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est cannot fly it. <hi>Thou shalt die.</hi> I am not the first nor the last, many went before, and many shall follow: <hi>Thou shalt die.</hi> VVhat wise Man ever took it amiss to be set at Liberty. VVhatever begins must end. <hi>Thou shalt die.</hi> It is not grievous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause but once to be suffered. They are Eternal Pains that torment. Now is Death less to be fear'd than formerly. For then the Gate of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven being not so open, all Men bewail'd for this.

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. How the Holy Men do desire, yet fear Death.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>LET us behold</hi> Paul, saith <hi>Gregory, how he loves what he seeks to avoid.</hi> How he avoids what he loves. He desires to die and yet fears to be spoil'd of his Flesh. Why so? because though the Eternal Victory over-joy him, yet the present pain disturbs him: And though the Love of the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence overcome him, yet he cannot be unsensible of the twitches and pangs of Torment. For as a Couragious Souldier just before the Battel palpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, trembles, looks pale, yet is still instigated by his Anger. So a Holy Man seeing the approach of his Suffering, is shaken by the weakness of his Nature, fears the approach of Death, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joices to die. And because there is no passage but through Death, therefore trusting he doubts, and doubting trust; rejoicing he fears, and fearing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joices. Because he knows he shall not attain the Garden of Repose, unless he get over the Hill that lyes between. <hi>David</hi> shew'd his fear of Death when he cry'd out, <hi>Lord take me not away in the midst of my Age.</hi> Neither was <hi>Abraham, Jacob</hi> nor <hi>Elias</hi> free from that fear though it were but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arsenius</hi> a Man of a Hundred and Twenty years of Age, after he had served God Five and Fifty years, being ready to depart the World, began to be afraid and to shed Tears; which his Friends admiring. <hi>And dost thou Father,</hi> cry'd they, <hi>fear death?</hi> To whom he, <hi>Verily,</hi> said he, <hi>ever since I have taken upon me Religious Orders, I have always been afraid of this Hour.</hi> To which purpose <hi>Seneca</hi> spake very perspicuously. <hi>Therefore,</hi> saith he, <hi>the</hi>
                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:52526:219"/>
                     <hi>stoutest Man, while he is putting on his Arms looks pale, and the fiercest Souldiers knees tremble a little at first. Charles</hi> the Fifth in all Warlike Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions most Couragious, in all Dangers most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted, yet when he put on his Armour before a Battel, was always wont to look pale, and quiver for fear, but after his Arms were on, like an Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Giant breathing nothing but a Lion-like Valour, like an Iron Giant he flew upon the Enemy.</p>
                  <p>Thus the best of Men desires and fears Death. But it is better to die with <hi>Cat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>AS the Tree when it is cut falls which way it bends. So which way we bend when we live, that way we fall when we die. It would be a strange thing that a commendable death should conclude an ill-spent Life. A Courtier of King <hi>Kenred,</hi> who studied more to please his Lord than his Saviour Christ, when he came to die, he did not so much seem to neglect, as to delay the care of his Soul. But at length seeing the Devils tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing about him, with a List of his wicked Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in despair he expir'd.</p>
                  <p>When the Impious <hi>Chrysaurius</hi> desir'd respite, respite but till Morning he expir'd with a denial. Thus <hi>Jezabel</hi> and <hi>Athaliah,</hi> thus <hi>Benhadad</hi> and <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shazzar,</hi> thus <hi>Antiochus</hi> and thousands of others, as they liv'd so they ended their days.</p>

                  <p>MOST truly said St. <hi>Austin, That is not to be thought an ill death which St.</hi> Ambrose <hi>gives us this Rule; A sincere fidelity and a discerning fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight. Or Charity with Prudence, and Prudence with Charity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Sole care of Salvation.</hi> This is the one thing necessary. St. <hi>Austin</hi> ten days before he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, admitted no body to see him, but the Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and the person that brought him sustenance, and that at set Hours. All the while employing himself in Prayers, Groans and Tears; leaving this Rule behind him, That no Man ought to depart hence without a worthy and competent Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>To Receive the Sacrament.</hi> In this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair delay is always dangerous.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>An Entire Resignation of thy self to the Divine Will.</hi> All Men perhaps cannot shew an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Spirit; but all Men can shew a willing Mind. Therefore let the sick Patient often repeat those words of the Lord Christ; <hi>Even so, O Father, for so was it thy good pleasure.</hi> He cannot well mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry, that so effectually reconciles himself to his Judge.</p>

Most Eternal God, O that I had liv'd as purely, as obediently, as holily, from the beginning to the end of the World, as all those Men did, who best pleas'd thee in the practice of all manner of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, in continual Miseries and Afflictions.

                  <p>A Man of an upright Mind is to live not as long as is convenient, but as long as it behoves him. Wisdom cries out, though he was soon dead, yet fulfilled he much time. For how has he not fulfill'd all times who passes to Eternity. For as much time as he has spent, not in Series of Years or Number of Days, but in Devotion, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable desire of profiting in Piety, so much does he deservedly claim of true Life. For he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in Vertue what he lost in time. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an unwearied study of profiting, and a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual going forward to perfection, is reputed for perfection.</p>

point, and has its end. Which the same <hi>Gregory</hi> confirming. 'Tis but little, all that has an end. For whatever tends to a Non-Entity by the course of time, ought not to seem long to us. Those ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moments that seem to delay it drive it on. St. <hi>Austin</hi> is more plain. <hi>All this time,</hi> saith he, <hi>I do not mean from to day till the end of the World, but from</hi> Adam <hi>to the end of the World, is but a drop compar'd to Eternity.</hi> All things else have an end, but Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity has none. There is nothing in the World but has an end; Banquets, Balls, Pleasure, Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, have all an end, but Eternity has none. Wherefore then do we set our Minds upon vain things? Nothing but what is durable will delight a great Mind. Whatever had a beginning shall have an end, only Eternity has no end.</p>

                  <p>IT was a saying of <hi>Vespasian, That an Emperor ought to die standing.</hi> I also say that it becomes a Christian to die no otherwise than standing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:52526:222"/>
In the year 1605 at <hi>Vienna</hi> the Night before <hi>Christmas</hi> day, a Souldier standing Sentinel in a small wooden House was frozen to death; in the Morning he was found standing, but not watching; for he had finished the VVatch of the Night and of his Life both together. In the same manner died another, who was frozen to death, and had done Living before he had done Riding; for the Horse knowing the way carried his Master to <hi>Constance</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his publick Quarters very faithfully. <hi>Q. Curtius</hi> testifies, that some of <hi>Alexanders</hi> Souldiers were frozen to death against the Trunks of Trees; and were found not only as if they had been living, but as if they had been talking together, being all in the same posture as death seized them.</p>
                  <p>VVe read that <hi>Leodeganius</hi> the Martyr, having his Head cut off, raised himself upright, and stood immoveable for above an Hour. <hi>Peter</hi> also the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr being upon his Knees, yet kneeled upright af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Head was off. In the times of <hi>Dioclesian</hi> and <hi>Maximilian; Ursus</hi> and <hi>Victor</hi> the Martyrs, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Heads were cut off walked with them a good way in their Hands: And so did not only die standing, but stood after they were dead.</p>
                  <p>Thus it becomes a Christian to die standing, and a dying Christian must stand and fight; he stands and fights well, who being supported by God, fears not to die.</p>

                  <p>These things may be admired, but not imitated, unless the Holy St. <hi>Paul</hi> intimates. <hi>You are dead,</hi> saith he, <hi>and your Life is hidden with Christ in God.</hi> Most Excellent is that Admonition of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; <hi>Live as it were lying hid.</hi> For he lives well that absconds himself well. Such a one is honestly buried by himself, and to his great Advantage. Who too much known to all men, dyes unknown to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. He dies most quietly, who ever buries him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self alive in that manner.</p>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 15. Nine Wills:</head>
                  <p>VEry truly said <hi>Pliny</hi> the younger; the common Opinion is false, that the Wills of Men are the mirrour of Manners.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Zilka</hi> bequeathed his Skin to make a Drum, and his Flesh to the Fowls of the Air, and Wild Beasts; and commanded his Souldiers to spare nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches nor Monuments. He died of the Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, in the year 1424.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There was a Woman that left her Cat, by Will, five Hundred Crowns, for her Cats Food, as long as she lived. O the ridiculous Fosteries of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Thoughts. <hi>Augustus</hi> said of <hi>Herod,</hi> I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be his Hog than his Son. A Man might as well have said, I had rather have been this Womans Cat than her Servant.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A Famous Usurer, being at the point of Death, sending for the <hi>Publick Notary</hi> and <hi>Respesses,</hi> caused his Will to be written in these VVords; Let my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be returned to the Earth, from whence it was taken; but my Soul be given to the Devils. His Friends astonished at his words, advised, rebuked him, but he again and again persisted; saying, Let my Soul be given to the Devils, for I have unjustly scraped together the most of my Estate. To them
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:52526:225"/>
belongs the Soul of my Wife, and the Souls of my Children, who that they might have wherewithal to spend upon Cloaths, Feasting and Luxury, put me upon the wicked Trade of Usury. To them also belongs the Soul of my Confessor, who encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged my wickedness by his silence. And so saying he breathed his last.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. St. <hi>Jerome</hi> rebukes the Covetousness of Heirs, with this Fable. A little Pig bewailed the Death of its Dam. with a most bitter gruntling; but hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Will read, and that there were a heap of Acorns, and some Bushels of Pease left him, he held his Peace; and being asked wherefore he cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his Lamentation so suddainly; Oh, saith he, the Acorns and the Pease have stopped my Mouth. This is the Humour of most Heirs now adays. They gape after the Legacies, make Inventories of the Goods, and tell the Money; let what will become of the Soul of the Testator; let him rest as he has deserved. But let us view another sort of Wills.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Holy Martyr <hi>Hierom,</hi> the fourth day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was carried to Execution, left his Estate to his Mother and Sister; but to <hi>Rusticius,</hi> who was chief in Authority in the Commonwealth of <hi>Aneyra,</hi> his Hand already cut off.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Holy <hi>Hilarion,</hi> at Fourscore years of Age, made <hi>Hesychius</hi> his Heir, in these Words. All my Wealth, that is to say, the Gospel, and one Hair Vest, my Coat, and little Cloak, I leave to my most loving Friend <hi>Hesychius.</hi> And this was all the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of his Goods.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Antonius</hi> the Great, made his Will, in these Words. As for the Place of my Burial, let no man know, but your own Love. My Felt, and old Cloak, give it to <hi>Athanasius,</hi> the Bishop, which he gave me when it was new. Let <hi>Serapion,</hi> the Bishop, take the other, which is somewhat better. Do you
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:52526:225"/>
take my Hair Garment. And so farewel. My Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els for <hi>Antony</hi> is going. He had no sooner ended these Words, but extending his Legs, he gave admittance to Death.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria, John</hi> of <hi>Almes,</hi> wrote his Will thus. I give thee thanks, O God, that at my Death, of all my Revenues, it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed thee to let me have remaining, but one third part of a pound. When <hi>Alexandria</hi> first made me their Patriarch, I found Fourscore Hundred pieces of Gold; to this the Friends of Christ added an unspeakable quantity of Money, all which, that I might give to God that which was Gods, I expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Poor; wherefore what remains I also give to them.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. To this may be added, the Will of a certain Christian, changing only the Name, the Year, and the Day.</p>
                  <p>I <hi>Achathius,</hi> Victor, have been running to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, from the year 1581. upon the <hi>15th.</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust,</hi> and have Eternity in my mind. Now I commend my Spirit to God; and because I cannot deny the Earth what belongs to it, I bequeath my Body to the Earth, and to the Worms. Of my Goods, there is nothing now mine, but good will, which I carry with me to the Tribunal of God; the rest I thus dispose.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. I forgive all my Enemies from the bottom of my Heart.</item>
                     <item>2. I am sincerely sorry for all my Sins.</item>
                     <item>3. I believe in Christ Jesus, my most loving Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. And in this Faith, I desire the Sacrament of the Church.</item>
                     <item>4. I hope for Eternal Life through the goodness of God.</item>
                     <item>5. I love my God, with all my Heart, above all things, and resign my self up fully to his holy will.</item>
                  </list>

Most absolute prepared to be well, to be sick, to live or die, when it shall please the Lord. The will of God be done.</p>
                  <p>Unless every Christian so order his Life, and his last Actions, he is to be thought to have lived ill. and to have died worse. The last Hour consumates Death, but is not the cause of it; which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded by a good Death. For nothing makes Death ill, but what follows Death. Good Seed brings a good Harvest. The Highway to a good Death, is a good Life. I may not unfitly compare Life and Death to a Syllogisine. The end of a Syllogisme, is the Conclusion; the Conclusion of Life Death: But the Conclusion is either true or false, according to the Nature of the Antecedents; so is Death good or bad, as the Life before was good or bad. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> severely prononnces, saying, <hi>Whose end shall be according to their VVorks.</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 15.</p>
                  <p>Memorable is the Death of that Holy Martyr, <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix,</hi> who being led to Execution, rejoicing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, with a loud Voice; I have, said he, preserved my Virginity, I have kept the Gospels, I have prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the Truth, and now I bow my Head a Victim to God. There is a Relation of one who died sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly in his Study, and was found with his Finger pointing to that Verse, in the Book of <hi>VVisdom,</hi> ch. 4. v. 7. which says. <hi>Though the Righteous be overta<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ken with Death, yet he shall find rest, pretions in the sight of the Lord, is the Death of his Saints whether slow or suddain.</hi>

                  <p>THE fore-runners of Eternity, is Death; the fore-runners of Death, are Pains, and deadly Symptoms. One deadly Symptome, if we believe <hi>Pliny,</hi> in the height of Madness is Laughter, in other Diseases an unequal Pulse. But the Eyes, and the Ears, shew most undoubted Prognosticks of Death. Experience teacheth us, that when sick People talk of going Journeys, and endeavoured to escape out of their Beds, when they pull and pick the Blankets, they are near Death. <hi>Augustus,</hi> the Emperor, a little before he expired, suddainly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, complained that he was carried away by Forty young Men. Which saith <hi>Suetonius,</hi> was rather a Presage, than a sign of any Delirium, for so many Pretorian Souldiers, when he was dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him to his Funeral Pile.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Alexander</hi> went by Water to <hi>Babylon,</hi> a sudden Wind rising blew off the Regal Ornament of his Head, and the Diadem fixt to it: This was

                     <hi>Barbara</hi> Princess of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> having shut her self up in a Nunnery, among other things allowed her for her peculiar Recreation, she had a Marjoram-Tree of an extraordinary bigness, a small Aviary, and a Gold Chain, which she wore about her Neck: but fourteen days before she died the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joram-Tree dried up; the Birds the next Night were all found dead; and after that the Chain broke in two in the middle. Then <hi>Barbara</hi> calling for the Abbess, told her that all those Warnings were for her, and in a few days after died, in the Seventeenth Year of her Age: After her death a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove twenty other Virgins died out of the same Nunnery.</p>

What do all these things Admonish us, but only this; <hi>Remember, O man, that thou art a man;</hi> think upon Eternity to which thou art hastening: Go to, prepare thy self, thou art called to that Tribunal of God; as thou didst live, shalt thou be judged.</p>

                  <p>Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> nothing troubled at the News of his Death; <hi>He never shall be great,</hi> saith he, <hi>who thinks it strange that Stones and Wood fall, and that Mortals die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Chrysostom</hi> a little before his Death, in Exile, wrote to <hi>Innocentius, We have been these three Years in Banishment, exposed to Pestilence, Famine, continual Incursions, unspeakable Solitude, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Death.</hi> But when he was ready to give up the ghost, He cryed out aloud, <hi>Glory be to thee, O God, for all things.</hi>

our Youth is gone. All our Time even to Yesterday is slid away. These things <hi>Gregory Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzene</hi> comprehending in a few words, <hi>There is no good among men, with which there is not something of evil mixt.</hi> Riches are a Snare; Poverty a Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Honour a meer Dream, Empire dangerous, Subjection troublesom, Youth is the Summer of Life, Grey-hairs the Sun-set of Life, Matrimony a Bond, Children the growing Crop of Care, Fulness breeds Petulance, Want begets Impatience. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we behold in this World, is like the World in a perpetual motion. Whatever seemed stable, is now doubtful, contending with the perpetual volubility of Day-night Labours, Diseases, Sorrows, Pleasures and Calamities; Death is most certain. Elegantly St. <hi>Austin; Death,</hi> saith he, <hi>is only cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, all things else uncertain.</hi> A Child once Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived perhaps is born, perhaps not, but perishes in Abortion.

                  <p>The first Book of <hi>Maccabees</hi> thus describes the Death of <hi>Alexander; Then he fell sick, and when he perceived that he should die,</hi> Alexander <hi>had wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for several Worlds in hopes of Victory, and thought with himself that he had performed Atchievements that deserved Eternal Annals.</hi> Nevertheless after so many and such great Victories, overcome at length he fell, not only into his Bed, but into his Tomb, contented with a small Coffin. <hi>Peter Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonsus</hi> reports, That several <hi>Philosophers</hi> flockt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and variously descanted upon the King's

                  <p>Thus forgetful of our selves, what Mountains do we raise to our selves in Thought. We revolve in our Minds Immortal, I wish they were Heavenly Things, whilst Death surprizes us in the midst of our vast Undertakings; and that which we call Old Age, is but the Circuit of a few Years. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do we trust to Death? Behold through what slight Occasions we lose our Lives. Our Food, our Moisture, our Watchings, our Sleep, are unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to us without their due measure. A small hurt of a Toe, a light pain of the Ear, a Worm in the Tooth, make way for Death. The little Body of Man is weak, frail, subject to Diseases; this Air, these Winds, those Waters offend him. Therefore let us believe the Son of <hi>Syras, Death is better than a bitter Life, and Eternal Rest better than continual Sickness.</hi> So that it is much better to be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant on Earth, than a Pilgrim in Heaven.</p>

                     <hi>BLessed are the dead that die in the Lord; even so saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours, and their works follow them.</hi> To die in the Lord, is the same thing as to die a Servant of the Lord; as the Scripture speaks concerning <hi>Moses,</hi>
                     <pb n="252" facs="tcp:52526:230"/>
                     <hi>Moses my Servant is dead.</hi> As if God had said, saith <hi>Cajetan, Though he were once a Sinner, and was not then my Servant, nevertheless he died my Servant.</hi> He so died, that whatever he was, or whatever he did, was mine; for a Servant wholly belongs to the Master: And let such a Servant of the Lord sing that Song of <hi>Simeon</hi> at his death, <hi>Lord, now let thy Servant depart in peace according to thy word.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in peace, and that Eternal; in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whereof all the Warfare of good men is at an end, never more to be rekindl'd. For such Servants of God die in the Lord, who dying, rest in the Bosom of God, and so resting, sweetly sleep in death. Thus <hi>Stephen</hi> among so many Showers of Stones, in such in the midst of the Tumult and Dinn of the Enraged Multitude, <hi>slept in the Lord.</hi> Thus <hi>Moses the Servant of the Lord, died by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God.</hi> Thrice happy and blessed are such, that never more shall be miserable. The death of the Just, saith St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> is good, because of its Rest, better because of its Novelty, best of all by reason of its Security. Blessed, and again thrice blessed are such, for their Works follow them: They follow them as Children follow their Parents, as Servants follow their Masters, as Scholars follow their Teacher, and Souldiers their Captain. They follow them to the Tribunal of God, to the Court of Heaven; as Peers follow their Prince, whither these Noble Servants are only admitted.</p>

                  <p>THere are many things of which it behoves me to Repent, of Vertue often neglected, and Time ill spent. How much did it become me to have been more patient, more submissive, more studious of daily Death. How small a Spark of Divine Love did glow in me! Pity me, O God, pity me, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy great Mercy! Spare a Sinner, O Infinite God, through the Passion and Blood of thy dear Son. But I have also offended you both in Word and Deed; Pardon me; you find me both Confessing and Sorry, and deny me not this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision for my Journey, the pardon of all my Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions. Let not your Vertue decrease by my Example, which was always bad. You have before your Eyes the Lives of the Saints, to which yours must conform. Enable their Patience, Submission, and Obedience to the utmost of your power. I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so return you thanks for your Pains, for your As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, for your Advice, and for your Love. God the inexhaustible Fountain of Goodness, and the Immense Ocean of Love, recompence your Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. God is certainly most Liberal to those that Commit themselves to his most holy Providence. Obedience is a most Noble Vertue, Patience is absolutely necessary, Submission is a most excellent Vertue, and Contempt of our selves, Poverty is a Vertue belov'd of Christ, Charity is the Queen of Vertue: Yet above all the Vertues, <hi>Faith in God</hi> seems to me to have something singular and most excellent, and a Plenary <hi>Resignation</hi> of a Man's self to Divine Providence, which the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:52526:231"/>
so commends, and which is continually in the Mouth of the Kingly Prophet, and which Christ endeavours to inculcate into us, by so many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments drawn from Flowers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> little Birds. The Vertues of this Faith, and the Tranquility that attends it, he only knows and finds, who in every thing as well small as great, most perfectly trusts in God, and confines himself to rely upon his Providence and Will Neither do I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is any man who had this Hope and Trust in God, but that strange and hidden My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries befell him.

All my Lifes Actions shall receive their definitive Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. How I tremble! for it is a terrible thing to stand in Judgment before God. But in this Extremity there is that which comforts me: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though I am a wicked Servant, my Lord is Gracious and Infinitely Good, who will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his Servant though he have been bad. And now God be with you all that Survive: Farewel all you that are to follow me in your order.</p>

                     <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> spoke these Words, Oh the Vain Thoughts of Men! Miserable Creatures, we are delighted with Honour, heap up Treasure, and neglect Heaven. O the happy Fate of the poor, who content with little Sleep in Tranquility. What does now my Kingdom, what do all my Guards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail me? <hi>I</hi> might have been Miserable, without all this Pomp. Where is now the power and strength of my Empire?

Of so many Thousands of Clyents, Servants and Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, there is not one that will or can accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to the Tribunal of God.

Consider that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> whispers these Words into thy Ears. When we die, we pass to Immortality. Nor can we attain to eternal Life, unless we depart from hence. Neither is this an Exit, but a Passage, and a flight to Eternity, after the short Conclusion of a Temperate Race. How preposterous, how perverse a thing it is, when we desire that the Will of God should be done, when
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:52526:233"/>
he calls us forth of this World, that we should not streight be obedient to his Will? We strive, we struggle, and like head-strong Servants we are haled into the presence of God, with Sadness and Sorrow; forc'd rather by Necessity, than won by the tie of our Obedience; and is it reasonable we should be honoured by him with Celestial rewards, to whom we go unwillingly? Wherefore do we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and pray that the Heavenly Kingdom may come, when our Earthly Captivity so much delighteth us? Wherefore do we so earnestly wish for the fulfilling of Christs Kingdom, when we had rather serve the Devil here, then raign with Christ there?</p>
                  <p>Then shall the Servants of God injoy Peace, and a calm and quiet Rest, when freed from the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of this World, when having vanquished Death we come to immortality. When to see Christ, it shall be our joy, when we can have no joy, but by, seeing Christ. What blindness of mind, what madness is it, to be in love with the Oppressions, Pains and Tears of this World, and not rather to make haste to that joy which can never be tak'n from us?</p>

Neither do thou dream of any Flesh than the former, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less

thou canst imagine God unjust to give the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to any other than that which has won the Prize, or that he should receive another to his Heavenly Rest, than that which won the Prize. The same Soul in all things, which in this Flesh fought the good fight, stood stedfast, learnt God, put on Christ, sowed the hope of Salvation, the same shall reap. The same Flesh that with the Soul ran through the whole Order of Life, endured, bled, with the same Soul, its Companion, shall reap the reward. <hi>Lazarus</hi> was the same after he had been four days in the Sepulchre as before, The same the Son, after the Mothers Tears were tried up as before: The same was Christ, after his being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombed as before. Neither does any aid of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulture deprive God of his Omnipotency, or put a stop to his Goodness. The same was the Tongue of the Rich Man, that was fed with-Banquets, and that which was scorched in the Infernal Flames, and begg'd to be relieved by the Finger of the more happy Begger; the same Flesh shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded or punished according to its Merits. Is not God able to enliv'n the Clay, with the same brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his Spirit as formerly? He that formed the Muscles, the Bones, the Nerves, the Veins, the Marrow, out of the same Clay, Can he not form the same, out of the same again? Is there a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity that what perishes once should always Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish? By what Law? Behold, that I may not stumble thee with any higher Philosophy; behold thy Universal returning, Order of all things; that is a testimony and argument of returning Man. Summers and Winters revolve, Springs and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tums have their turns. The light of Sun and Stars return with the morning Splendor, or the natural Darkness had obscured. Thou wouldst think the Vine dead, and the Branches only fit for the Fire,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:52526:234"/>
yet we see them revive again, and thicker clad than before; and what the cold Kills, the heat of Summer restores more Beautiful, as if decay it self paid use. Not that these things, in all things, prove the Reparation of Human Life but lead us to it. Wouldst thou have more signal Arguments? We have a pledge in Christ, in whom we Usurp Heaven, and the Kingdom of God. Wouldst thou have it in Man? The mortified and putrified Flesh of <hi>Lazarus;</hi> wise Flesh. <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> made known to the Apostles, demonstrated, that the same Habit and Condition of Body is still preserv'd in Glory. And the departed Souls delivered out of the Prisons of this Flesh, and returned to their own pure Light and Substance; yet desire nothing more than to be clad with this refin'd Clay, and in the former Matrimonial Society, to continue a Life with the same Flesh, never to be dissolved; that they which endured together may injoy the same equality of Glory, like Christ their Captain, who ascended Flesh and Bone into Heaven, a Pledge and Argument of our future Purity.</p>

                  <p>FIrst <hi>Death</hi> kills our familiar Enemy the <hi>Body.</hi> There is no mischief more pestilential than a Bosom-Enemy. <hi>The Flesh lusteth contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit contrary to the Flesh,</hi> Gal. 5. 17. These are contrary one to another.</p>
                  <p>2ly, <hi>Death</hi> breaks the Door of the Prison where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are lockt up: But as old Prisoners, many times long acquaintance with the place detains us not unwilling in the midst of our Fetters and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffferings. But the best of Kings desired to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out of Custody.</p>
                  <p>3ly, <hi>Death</hi> eases us of a vast Burthen; for why, a corruptible Body is heavy to the Soul, and the Earthy Mansion keepeth down that Understanding that museth upon many things: No man can swim with this Burthen.</p>
                  <p>4ly, <hi>Death</hi> puts an end to our Pilgrimage. What is Mortal Life, saith St. <hi>Gregory, but a way?</hi> Consider my Friends, what it is to be aweary, upon the way. Our present Life is full of pain, a perpetual strugling, and yet we cannot forsake it without Tears.</p>
                  <p>5ly, <hi>Death</hi> brings us out of all Danger. The most Fortunate Man that lives is subject to many
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:52526:236"/>
Dangers; and Danger is hardly avoided without danger. He has only escaped all Dangers, who is out of this Life.</p>
                  <p>6ly, The necessity of <hi>Death.</hi> Nobly said the wise <hi>Roman, There is no greater comfort in Death, than Death it self.</hi> He would not live, that would not die. Death carries with it an impartial and unvanquishable Necessity. For the first part of Impartiality is Equality.</p>
                  <p>7ly. The Death of Christ. To the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this, St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts us: <hi>Let us,</hi> saith he, <hi>run with patience unto the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 1. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Battel that is set before us. Looking unto Jesus the Captain and Finisher of our Faith; who for the Joy that was set before him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the Cross.</hi> To the Members of this Head this is the greatest Consolation: For that the Members should not fear Death, the Head endured the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most violence of Death. The Author of Life by dying set open the Gates of Heaven. Why do we fear to die?</p>
                  <p>8ly, The Hope of Resurrection. Wherefore do we expostulate with <hi>Death?</hi> He does not deprive us, but introduces us into Life. The Day will shine that will recal us from our Graves. We shall all rise. Which sundry Arguments demonstrate unto us, as has been already shewed.</p>
                  <p>9ly, Immortality it self. <hi>Death</hi> is the end and passage; the end of Calamity, the passage to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity. Hence the death of the Just is called their <hi>Birth-day.</hi> Hence also that other Saying, <hi>Death is but a Sport to a true Christian.</hi> And that no man might fear this Sport, <hi>Prudentius</hi> in his Hymns, has these Lines.</p>

                  <p>Now also Christ shall be magnified in my Body, whether it be by Life or by death. For Christ is to me Life, and Death is to me Advantage. Having a desire to depart and be with Christ, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 20, 21.</p>
                  <p>But our Conversation is in Heaven, whence also we look for the Saviour; who shall change our vile Body, that it may be fashioned like his glorious Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
                  <p>This is a faithful saying, and by all means wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be received, that Christ Jesus came into the World to save sinners, of whom I am chief, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15,</p>

                  <p>Lord God! How great is the Abyss of thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Thy Friends and Kindred are silent; thy Disciples forsake thee; the Angels appear not. Where are those thousands fed by this Crucified Lord? Who of all that multitude speaks one word for so great a Benefactor? Yet the Thief against his Companion pleads the Cause of Christ, and jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies his Innocency; take off all Scandals from

him, and convicts the Multitude of Murther. Nor was the Son of God asham'd of such an Advocate; but rather applauded him. Nor was the happy Rhetorician wanting in his Cause. <q>But we truly, said he, are righteously punished, for we receive according to our deeds, but this Man hath done nothing amiss.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh how truely may I say the same of my self. I justly now dye, I receive according to my Deeds, but my God and my Lord did nothing, that he should dye, and dye in so much Torment. And therefore may I truely use this Prayer, <hi>Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me because thou art come into thy Kingdom.</hi> And because thou art now in thy Kingdom look upon me weeping in this Exile, and admit me go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hence into thy Kingdom. This I beg of thee for the sake of thy Scourgings, thy Thorns, thy Cross, and through thy Torments and thy Death.</p>
                  <p>Therefore what remains but for me to throw my Soul into his Bosom, who alone considers its Pains and Sufferings, He knows what conduces to the Salvation of Souls; <hi>I wait for thy Salvation, O Lord.</hi>

                  <p>THE Heliotrope is a Flower, which as we find by daily Experience, turns it self with the Sun from East to West, and doing the same even in cloudy VVeather; and in the Night, for want of the Sun contracts and shuts up the Beauty of its Colours. Let the will of Man always wait upon Divine Pleasure, continually turning and winding it self to the beck of Sacred Power, though the VVeather be cloudy. Nor can any day in all
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:52526:244"/>
the life of Man be more cloudy than the day of our death. Then let the dying Person with fix'd and stedfast Eyes, like the Heliotrope, turn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to his only Sun. This let our Saviours words teach us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Even so, O Father, for so was it thy good pleasure.</hi> After this manner, my dear dying Friend speak al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together. In all things to be done, to be avoided, to be endured and born, according to thy Lords Example always say; Even so, O Father, even so; always submitting thine to the most holy VVill. Even so, O Father, even so, both now and for evermore.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philip</hi> the second King of <hi>Spain,</hi> groaning under the pains of a desperate Disease, was wont continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to repeat these words of our Saviour. <hi>Father, not mine, but thy will be done.</hi> And one time among the rest, as the Passion of Christ was read to him, while the Chirurgeons were Lanching open an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posthume, he caused the Reader to stop at these words. So highly did that great King value this Heliotropian Receit, as well in Health as in Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>

            <head>THE Fatal Moment.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>VVHen we dye our Everlasting state is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd! After Death the Judgment.</hi> The moment of our departure hence will pass us over to the Righteous Tribunal of God. It will make us either to shine with the Angels above, or to set with the Devils. It will either fix us in a joyful Paradise, or in an intolerable state of Woe. So that we may say with <hi>Nieremberg,</hi> How many things are to pass in that Moment? In the same is our Life to finish, our Works to be examined, and we are then to know how it will go with us for ever and ever? In that Moment I shall cease to Live, in that Moment I shall behold my Judge, in that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I must answer for all my publick and my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Actions, for all that I have ever thought, or spoke, or done; for all the Talents, the Time, the Mercies, the Health, the Strength, the Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and the Seasons, and Days of Grace that I have ever had, for all the Evil that I might have avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for all the good I might have done and did not, and all this before that Judge, who has beheld my ways from my Birth to the Grave; before that Judge who cannot be deceiv'd, and who will not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon. Little can he that has not been brought near to Death and Judgment know what Thoughts the Diseased have when they are so. Little, very little does a Soul in Flesh know what it is to appear before the Great God. This is so great and so
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:52526:245"/>
strange a thing, that they only know it who have receiv'd their final Sentence; but they are not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to return to tell us how it is, or what passes then; and God sees it fit it should be concealed from us who are yet on this side the Grave. But who does not tremble to think of this mighty Change, and of this Moment that is the last of Time and the beginning of Eternity; that includes Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Hell, and all the Effects of the Mercy and Justice of God.</p>
            <p>Who does not tremble when he considers that Infinite and Holy Majesty before whom the Angels cover their Faces; that considers his Omniscience, and his Greatness, and the mighty Consequences of that Sentence, how sudden it is, and how irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistible, and that it is an irrevocable Decree, and by a Word of this mighty Judge we live or dye for ever. It is no wonder if the thoughts of it make us shrink and quiver. It is a greater wonder that when some or other, whom we know, are almost every week going to such a place and state as this, we who are not yet Cited to the Bar, are no more concerned, and use no more endeavours to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for it.</p>
            <p>Oh my Friends, when you come to the Borders of the Grave, when you are within an Hour or two's distance from your Final Judgment, and your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable state; what a mighty Change will it cause in your thoughts and your apprehensions. You will then know and feel it. Then, when the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective is turn'd, and the other World begins to appear very great, and this very little. This that I have represented to you is a part of that which we call dying.</p>
            <p>It is a great Mercy, and greatly to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd that God allows us so much Time wherein to prepare our selves for this final and irrevocable
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:52526:245"/>
Doom. It is an instance of his Patience that is truly Divine, that notwithstanding our many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Sins he has not cut us off. It is his great Mercy that gives us leave to appear in his Courts before we appear at his Tribunal, and that he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords us such large notice and warning that so we may be ready for our Last Tryal, whereon so very much depends.</p>

            <head>THE TREATMENT OF OUR Departed Friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> AFTER THEIR DEATH In Order to <hi>Their Burial,</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHen we have received the last Breath of our Friend, and closed his Eyes, and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his Body for the Grave, then solemn and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Mournings, are good Expressions of our dearness to the departed Soul, and of his worth, and our value of him.</p>
            <p>The Church in her Funerals of the dead, used to sing Psalms, and to give thanks for the Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Delivery of the Soul, from the evils and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of Mortality.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:52526:246"/>
But it is good that the Body be kept veiled and secret, and not exposed to curious Eyes; neither should the dishonours wrought upon the Face, by the changes of death, be stared upon by imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent persons. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> was dying, he called his Sons and Friends to take their leave of him, to touch his Hand, to see him the last time, and gave in charge, that when he had put his Vail over his Face, no Man should uncover it. And <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his Body was rescued from inquisitive Eyes by a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. Let it be interr'd after the manner of the Countrey, and Laws of the Place, and the Dignity of the Person; for so <hi>Jacob</hi> was Buried with great Solemnity, and <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Bones were carried into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> after they had been embalmed, and kept 400 years, and <hi>devout men carried St.</hi> Stephen <hi>to his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, making great lamentation over him.</hi> And <hi>Aelian</hi> tells us that those who were the most excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, were buried in publick, and men of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Courage and Fortune had their Graves only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>rim'd with Branches of green Olives, and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Flowers, together with a few sprigs of Rosema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Bays.</p>
            <p>But nothing of this concerns the dead in real and effective purposes; nor is it with care to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for by themselves, but it is the duty of the living; for to them, it is all one whether they be carried forth in a Chariot or a wooden Bier, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they rot in the Air, or in the Earth, whether they be devoured by Fishes or by Worms, by Birds or by Sepulchral Dogs, by Water or by Fire, or by delay.</p>
            <p>Concerning doing honour to the dead, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration is not long; anciently the Friends of the dead used to make their Funeral Orations, and the Custom descended, and in the Channel of time it mingled it self in the Veins of the Earth, through
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:52526:247"/>
which it passed. <hi>And now a days, Men that dye</hi> are commended <hi>at a price,</hi> and the measure of their Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy, is the <hi>degree</hi> of their Vertue. But <hi>these things ought not so to be,</hi> the reward of the greatest Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue ought not to be prostitute to the doles of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Persons, but preserved like flourishing Laurels and Coronets, to remark and encourage the noblest things.</p>
            <p>But that which is most considerable is, that we perform the will of the dead, the Laws oblige us, and will see to it; but did they not, certainly it is the noblest thing in the World, to do an act of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to him whom we shall never see again, but yet hath deserved it of us, and to whom we would do it if he were present: And unless we do so, our Charity is Mercenary, and our <hi>Friendships</hi> are direct Merchandize, and our Gifts are Brokage; but what we do to the dead, or to the living for their sakes, is <hi>Gratitude, and Vertue for Vertues sake, and the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest portion of Humanity, Kindness and Love.</hi>

               <head>The Reasons why we shut the Eyes and Mouth of the Dead.</head>
               <p>IN the first place, when our dear Friends and Relations are dead, we close their <hi>Eyes</hi> and <hi>Mouth,</hi> which a Learned Author says, is a Custom that was used by the Primitive Christians, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present that the death of the Faithful is, according to the Oracles of Scripture, nothing else but a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; since after having been asleep for a while, they shall be awaked to Eternity. Moreover by <hi>shutting their Eyes and Mouth,</hi> we do intimate, that the dead are no more to take delight in the Objects of this visible World, their Employment now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing stedfastly to behold all the Ravishing Beauties
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:52526:247"/>
of the other World, and continually to praise God, who is the Glorious and Bountiful Dispenser of them.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>The Reasons why Dead Bodies are often Kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, Washed, Perfumed and Cloathed: Together with the Customs of several Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Burial of their Dead.</head>
               <p>MAny Persons, 1. Kiss, and kindly Salute their dead Friends and Relations, to shew the natural tenderness and love they had for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased; but this Custom is now quite abolished with us in many places, though this practice ought not to be altogether discommended. 2. As for the usage that is in some Countreys, of washing the dead, St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> tells us, that it was derived at first from the Person of our Lord and Saviour, whose precious Body was washed as soon as they took it down from the Cross. And we read in the ninth Chapter of the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> that a Woman of <hi>Joppa</hi> called <hi>Tabitha,</hi> whom St. <hi>Peter</hi> restored to Life, had been wash'd before she was laid out for the Grave. <hi>The Indians burn their dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Custom of Perfuming and Embalming the Corps, hath in our days been (especially in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi> much observed. And indeed the very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> were so careful to <hi>perfume the dead,</hi> was, because they regarded them as so many Members of the Mystical Body of the Redeemer of the World. <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Apology, upbraiding the Heathens with the vast expences of sweet Scents and Perfumes, consumed in the Temples, tells them that those <hi>Odours</hi> would be better employed, in perfuming and embalming
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:52526:248"/>
the Bodies of Christians, and their dear Friends de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. At the <hi>Canary Islands they bury their Dead with a Bottle of Wine standing by them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. As concerning the manner of Apparelling the Dead, all Christians use not the same practice; for some do only cover them with a large <hi>Winding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheet,</hi> as they do in <hi>France:</hi> And others dress them in the very same Cloaths they were wont to wear, as in <hi>Italy,</hi> and several other places. And others dress them and lay them in their Coffin, in a white Shirt, a clean Cap <hi>(with their Toes tyed with a black Ribband)</hi> and sometimes (as a late Act of Parliament enjoyns) in Flannel; this is the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom in <hi>England.</hi> And likewise here it is the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom to set the Body when drest in order to the Grave, either in the Entry, or the principal and most publick Room of the House, and that for this reason, and that by this sight, those that pass by it at the Funeral, may be taken off from Terrestri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al things, and fix their thoughts on those that are Heavenly, by being thereby put in mind of their <hi>latter end,</hi> and that it will not be long before they must lye in the like posture too, in order to be carried on their Friends Shoulders to their Graves, as this their Friend or Relation is now to be carried. <hi>The Chineses always before they Bury their Dead</hi> (if he was a Married Man) <hi>bring him to his Wife, that so she might first kiss him, and bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>NOW having thus for taken care of the dead Body, the next thing is to consider the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and manner of the Pomp and Ceremony, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the <hi>English</hi> carry their dead to the Grave, the manner is thus.</p>
               <p>The whole Company of Invited Guests (being the Relations, Mourners for, and Friends of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased) march in a <hi>sorrowful Procession,</hi> first to the Church, and then to the Grave, attended with more or less Pomp and Ceremony, according to the <hi>Quality</hi> of the Party deceased: At the Head of this <hi>solemn attendance,</hi> the <hi>Minister</hi> that is to <hi>bury the Corps,</hi> walketh before the Corps (and if the party deceased was a Person of Quality or Fashion) then goes a vast number of <hi>young Blew-Coats (Boys and Girls)</hi> singing Psalms and Hymns most melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously all the way to the Church; next to these <hi>Ranks</hi> now recited, goes a <hi>huge croud</hi> of Mourners and other People, that accompany the <hi>Corps,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of usually some are <hi>weeping</hi> and <hi>lamenting,</hi> whilst others are <hi>swooning,</hi> and sometime almost fainting away by reason of grief for the party deceased. <hi>(Though such excessive lamenting usually lasts not long, as appears plainly by the story of a Woman, who did passionately follow her Husband to the Grave, and would by all means be buried alive with him, yet (being of a base and wanton temper) as soon as ever the black attire of her Husbands Funeral was over, the next day she married a brisk Youngster, with whom she lived jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <head>THE Funeral Solemnity.</head>
            <p>I Might here inlarge upon Mourning for, and the Ancient Customs and Manners of <hi>Burying the Dead in all Nations,</hi> throughout all the habitable World.</p>
            <p>The Ancient <hi>Romans</hi> did use them that were dead after two manners, and they had two <hi>kinds of Obsequies;</hi> the first and most Ancient was to cover the dead with Earth, and to bury them as we do; the other to burn their Bodies, but this manner did not continue long.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> was the Inventer of Obsequies, and he Instituted a High-priest, who had the Charge. The first Honour which they used to perform in the Obsequies of Famous Persons, was to commend the Party by an Oration. <hi>Valerius Publicola</hi> made a Funeral Oration on the death, and in the praise of <hi>Brutus.</hi> In like manner <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> being but Twelve years old, commended his Grandfather; and <hi>Tiberius</hi> at the Age of Nine years praised his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The second Honour was to make Sword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>players to Fight. <hi>Marcus</hi> and <hi>Decius</hi> Sons to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ius Brutus,</hi> were the first that did practise this, in Honour of their Father. The third Honour was, to make a Feast of <hi>Magnificent Furnishment.</hi> The fourth was a distribution of Meat to all the common People. And such (as I have said before) as could not be Buried with the like, and so great Pomp (for the Expences were insupportable) were buried in the Night time, by the <hi>Vespilions</hi> clothed all in white, who carried the dead Body to his Grave. They had likewise an Order, that
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:52526:250"/>
within some while after the Obsequles, they would strew <hi>divers Flowers and sweet Odours</hi> upon the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, as the <hi>Roman</hi> people did upon the Funeral Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ument of <hi>Scipio.</hi> And also they accustomed yearly to Garnish, Deck, and Adorn the Tombs or Graves of the Dead, with Posies, Crowns and Garlands of all sorts of Flowers. Husbands (saith Saint <hi>Jerom ad Pammachum)</hi> were wont to straw, spread, or scatter over, and upon the Graves and Sepulchers of their deceased dear Wives, Violets, Roses, Lillies, Hyacinths, and divers Purple Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; by which <hi>uxorious Office</hi> they did mi igate and lessen the grief of their Hearts, conceived by the loss of their <hi>Loving Bed-fellows.</hi> The like expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mutual Love Wives shewed to their buried Husbands.</p>
            <p>Now above all Flowers in these Ceremonious Observances, the <hi>Rose</hi> was in greatest request, and had the sole preheminence, as <hi>Kirman</hi> relates. To which <hi>Jo. Passeratius</hi> in his <hi>Rosa</hi> thus alludes.
<q>
                  <l>Manibus est imis Rosa grata, &amp; grata Sepulchris,</l>

To Mourn after the Interment of our Friends, is a Manifest Token of true Love; by it we express that Natural Affection we had to the departed, with a Christian-like Moderation of our Grief, whereby our Faith to God-ward is demonstrated. For as God has made us living, so hath he made us loving Creatures, to the end we should not be as Stocks and Stones, void of all kind and natural Affection, but that living and loving together, the love of the one should not end with the life of the other.</p>
            <p>Our all Perfect and Almighty Saviour Christ Jesus, wept over the Grave of dead <hi>Lazarus</hi> (whom he revived) whereupon the standers by said among themselves, <hi>Behold how he loved him.</hi>

As a <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen, by the <hi>Valerian</hi> and <hi>Porcian</hi> Law, he was exempted from any such Ignominious and Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Punishment, though by the Law of the Twelve Tables, Notorious Malefactors Condemned by the <hi>Centuriate</hi> Assemblies, were first to be Scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and then put to Death.

                  <p>As our Apostle was led to Execution, he is said to have Converted three of the Souldiers who Guarded him; which the Emperour hearing, commanded that they should be put to death: St. <hi>Paul</hi> being come to the place appointed for his Execution, which was near the <hi>Aquae Salviae,</hi> three Miles from <hi>Rome,</hi> after he had exhorted such as came to see his Tragedy, to Repentance, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended his Spirit into the hands of his blessed Lord and Master, he kneeling down, had his Head stricken off with a Sword.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> declares, That his chearful submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Death, and his constant Courage till the last, was a means not only to Convert his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, but several others, who afterwards suffered Marryrdom for the Faith of Christ. He was Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, as far as can be gathered, in the Sixty eighth Year of his Age. And thus the great Apostle, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had Preached the Gospel to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and either in Person, or by his Epistles, visited most of the known World; and as <hi>Theodoret</hi> tells us, in the Isles of the Sea, (whereby he undoubtedly means <hi>Britain)</hi> he received first the Crown of Martyrdom.</p>
                  <p>He was Buried <hi>in via Ostiensis,</hi> about two Miles from <hi>Rome, Over whose Grave,</hi> about 318 Years

                  <p>DUring his Imprisonment, he wrote to his Wife and Friends in this manner: <hi>I am merry, and I trust I shall be so, maugre the Teeth of all the Devils in Hell. Riches I have none to bestow amongst you, but that Treasure of tasting how sweet Christ is to hungry Consciences, (whereof I thank my Saviour I do feel part) that I bequeath to you, and to the rest of my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved in the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They offered to release him, if he would Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant; to which he replied, <hi>That he did confess Life and Liberty were things desirable, but that he would not murther his Conscience to save his life; but by God's Grace;</hi> said he, <hi>I will abide the worst Extremity that Man can do against me, rather than do any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst my Conscience.</hi> And when <hi>Gardiner</hi> threatned him with Death, he said, <hi>Welcom be it, whatsoever the Will of the Lord be, either life or death; and I tell you truly, I have learned to die; but I exhort you to be ware of shedding innocent blood, for truly it will cry aloud against you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After a Year and three Months Imprisonment, he was brought to the Stake, which he embraced, and afterwards kissing, said, <hi>Welcom Cross of Christ, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com everlasting life.</hi> The Fire by the malice of his Enemies being made of green wood, put him to exquisite Torments, but he endured them with a Christian patience, as being well assured when his fiery Tryal was at an end, he should receive a Crown of Life that fadeth not away. One thing I shall not think amiss to insert: When the Nation was in fear of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s bringing in <hi>Popery,</hi> Mr. <hi>Saunder</hi>'s being in company with Doctor <hi>Pedleton,</hi> and seeming to be much dejected, <hi>Pedleton</hi> said,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:52526:278"/>
                     <hi>What man, there is much more cause for me to fear, than for you; for asmuch as I have a big and fat Body, yet will I see the utmost drop of this Grease of mine melted away, and this Flesh consumed with Fire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will forsake Jesus Christ and his Truth which I have professed.</hi> Yet when Queen <hi>Mary</hi> came to the Crown, he turned Apostate.</p>

                  <p>HE was led through the Park to the Seaffold before <hi>VVhite-Hall,</hi> where having declared that he died a Martyr for the Laws and Liberties of his People, he made a Confession of his Faith, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting, that he died a true Son of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> then he betook himself to his private De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, and so patiently submitted his Royal Head to Martyrdom, from the hand of a disguised Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner.

                  <head>The Death of Old Mr. <hi>Eliot,</hi> of <hi>New-England.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>WHILE he was making his Retreat out of this evil World, his Discourses from time to time ran upon, The coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. It was the Theme which he still had Recourse unto, and we were sure to have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this, whatever other Subject he were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. On this he talk'd, of this he pray'd, for this he long'd, and especially when any bad News ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd, his usual Reflection thereupon would be, <q>Behold some of the Clouds in which we must look for the coming of the Son of Man.</q> At last his Lord, for whom he had been long wishing, <q>Lord come, I have been a great while ready for thy coming!</q> At last, I say, his Lord came, and fetched him away into the Joy of his Lord.</p>
                  <p>He fell into some Languishments, attended with a Fever, which in a few days brought him into the Pangs (may I say? or Joys) of Death: And while he lay in these, Mr. <hi>Walter</hi> coming to him, he said unto him: <q>Brother, Thou art welcome to my very Soul. Pray, retire to my Study for me, and give me leave to be gone,</q> meaning, that he should not, by Petitions to Heaven for his Life, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him here. It was in these Languishments, that speaking about the work of the Gospel among the <hi>Indians,</hi> he did after this Heavenly manner express himself. <q>There is a Cloud (said he) a dark Cloud upon the Work of the Gospel, among the poor <hi>Indians.</hi> The Lord revive and prosper that Work, and grant it may live when I am dead. It
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:52526:299"/>
is a work, which I have been Doing much and long about. But what was the word I spoke last? I recal that word, My Doings: Alas, they have been poor, and small, and lean Doings, and I'll be the Man that shall throw the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>It has been observed, that they who have spoke many considerable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>hings in their Lives, usually speak few at their Deaths. But it was otherwise with our <hi>Eliot,</hi> who after much Speech of and for God in his Life-time, u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>tered some things little short of <hi>Oracles</hi> on his Death-bed; which, 'tis a thousand pities, they were not more exactly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded and recorded. Those Authors that have taken the pains to Collect, <hi>Apophthegmata Morenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> have not therein been unserviceable to the Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but the <hi>Apophthegms</hi> of a Dying <hi>Eliot</hi> must have had in them a Grace and a Strain truly extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary; and indeed the <hi>vulgar Error</hi> of the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal sweetness in the Song of a <hi>Dying Swan,</hi> was a very <hi>Truth</hi> in our expiring <hi>Eliot;</hi> his last Breath s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>elt strong of Heaven, and was Articled into none but very gracious Notes; one of the last whereof, was, <hi>Welcome Joy!</hi> And at last it went away, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon the standers by, to <hi>Pray, pray, pray!</hi> which was the thing in which so vast a portion of it had been before Employ'd.</p>
                  <p>This was the peace, in the end of this <hi>Perfect and Upright Man;</hi> thus was there another Star fetched away to be placed among the rest that the third Heaven is now enriched with. He had once, I think, a pleasant Fear, that the old Saints of his Acquaintance, especially those two dearest Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of his, <hi>Cotton</hi> of <hi>Boston,</hi> and <hi>Mather</hi> of <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> who were got safe to Heaven before him, would suspect him to be gone the wrong way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he staid so long behind them. But they are
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:52526:299"/>
now together with a Blessed Jesus, <hi>beholding of his Glory,</hi> and celebrating the High Praises of Him that has <hi>called them into his marvellous light.</hi> Whether <hi>Heaven</hi> was any more <hi>Heaven</hi> to him, because of his finding there so many <hi>Saints</hi> with whom he once had his Delicious and Coelestial Intimacies, yea, and so many <hi>Saints</hi> which had been the Seals of his own Ministry, in this lower World, I cannot say; but it would be <hi>Heaven</hi> enough unto him, to go unto that <hi>Jesus,</hi> whom he had lov'd, preach'd, serv'd, and in whom he had been long assured there does <hi>All Fulness dwell.</hi> In that Heaven I now leave him: but not without <hi>Grynaeus</hi>'s pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Exclamations, <hi>(O beatum illum diem!)</hi> 
                     <q>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed will be the Day, O blessed the Day of our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival to the glorious Assembly of Spirits, which this great Saint is now reioicing with!</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Bereaved <hi>New-England,</hi> where are thy Tears, at this Ill-boding Funeral? We had a Tradition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, <q>That the Countrey could never perish, as long as <hi>Eliot</hi> was alive.</q> But into whose hands must this <hi>Hippo</hi> fall, now the <hi>Austin</hi> of it is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way? Our <hi>Elisha</hi> is gone, and now who must <hi>next year invade the Land?</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> have a saying, <hi>Quando Luminaria paetiuntur Eclipsm, malum signum est mundo;</hi> but I am sure, 'tis a dismal <hi>Eclipse</hi> that has now befallen our <hi>New-English</hi> World. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, many of the Ancients fell into the vanity of esteeming the Reliques of the <hi>Dead Saints,</hi> to be the <hi>Towers</hi> and <hi>Ramparts</hi> of the place that enjoy'd them; and the <hi>dead Bodies</hi> of two Apostles in the City, made the Poet cry out,
<q>
                        <l>A Facie Hostili duo propugnacula praesunt.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Dust of <hi>dead Saints</hi> could give us any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, we are not without it; here is a Spot of
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:52526:300"/>
                     <hi>American</hi> Soyl that will afford a rich Crop of it, at the <hi>Resurrection of the Just.</hi> Poor <hi>New-England</hi> has been as <hi>Glastenbury</hi> of old was called, <hi>A Burying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place of Saints.</hi> But we cannot see a more terrible Prognostick than Tombs filling apace with such Bones, as those of the Renowned <hi>Eliot</hi>'s; the whole Building of this Countrey trembles at the fall of such a Pillar.</p>
                  <p>For many Months before he dyed, he would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten chearfully tell us, <q>That he was shortly going to Heaven, and that he would carry a deal of good News thither with him; he said, He would carry Tidings to the Old Founders of <hi>New-England,</hi> which were now in Glory, that Church work was yet carried on among us: That the number of our Churches was continually encreasing: And that the Churches were still kept as big as they were, by the daily additions of those that shall be saved.</q> But the going of such as he from us, will apace diminish the occasions of such happy tydings.</p>
                  <p>What shall we now say? Our <hi>Eliot</hi> himself used most affectionately to bewall the Death of all useful Men; yet if one brought him the notice of such a thing, with any Despondencies, or said, <q>O Sir, such a one is dead, what shall we do?</q> he would answer, <q>Well, but God lives, Christ lives, the Old Saviour of <hi>New-England</hi> yet lives, and he will Reign till all his Enemies are made his Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stool.</q> This, and only this consideration have we to relieve us; and let it be accompanied with our addresses to the God of the Spirits of all Flesh, That there may be <hi>Timothies</hi> raised up in the room of our Departed <hi>Pauls,</hi> and that when our <hi>Moses</hi>'s are gone, the Spirit which was in those brave Men, may be put upon the surviving Elders of our <hi>Israel.</hi> Thus died the first Preacher of the Gospel to the <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>New-England.</hi> Aged 86.</p>
