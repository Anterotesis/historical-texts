         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is written, He that watches for Iniquity shall be cut off, and the wickednesse of the wicked shall come to an end, although the long suffering of the Lord be great, who waiteth that men might return and cease to work iniquity, and to strive against his holy Spirit by which he reproveth the world of sin and the wicked of their transgressions, and to this end hath he given a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his spirit to every man, (though contemned and dispised by the wicked) that they might see themselves and be humbled for their Iniquity and repent of their transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, yet notwithstanding such is the obstinancy of many, as that they hate the reproof of Instruction, yea the scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and the fools unto whom Wisdom crieth, Return at my reproof, so that all are left without excuse; Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing though they reject the mercy and love of the Lord and gain-sayeth his holy Spirit, though they do for a while perfist in their wickednesse, yet this shall be the end, the wicked shall not go unpunished, of that, certain Testimony is given that God hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the secrets of all hearts by Jesus Christ according to the Everlasting Gospel, which was declared and now is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished again by them that are come and coming out of the Apostacy, and in that day thou <hi>Thomas Underhill</hi> shalt be convinced of thy ungodly deeds, and of thy hard speeches and false accusations, and reproachful calumniations and slanders, and of many false things which thou hast charged against a people whom Christ hath Redeemed by his most precious blood, which thou shalt be judged for in that day, when terror shal fill thy heart &amp; wrath come upon thee from whence thou shalt not be able to flie, though thou may cal to the hard Rocks and to the high Hills which are in the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, whose hands thou wouldst now strengthen against the Just, and blind their eyes, that so they might receive thy false suggestions and instigations, and so would perswade them to stretch out their hands against them which is to be preserved and cherished, who are dear unto the Lord as the

Apple of his eye, but the Lamb of God who taketh away the sins of the World, who is arisen and arising in his power and might to make War in Righteousnesse against the beast and his power, the Mother of Harlots, and her golden Cup of fornication, against Antichrist &amp; his men of War, against the Dragon and his Army, and he is travelling in the greatness of his strength, who shall subdue the Nations to himself, and break all the ungodly that stands is his way as a Potters vessel, and behold a numberlesse number hath taken part with him who rides on in the power and strength of his might, the least of which thou shalt not be able to stand before, but shalt vanish as smoke, and be consumed as stubble before the fire, which shall burn up all the ungodly, and melt them all away that hate the Lord, then shalt thou call to the Rocks and to the Hills, from whence thou now looks for Salvation, that thou might be preserved in safety still in <hi>Babylon</hi> where is thy habitation, and in the Region of the shadow of death which thou hast taken up for thy dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place) and that they might suppress that which thou calls Heresie and Blaspemy which hath invaded thy kingdom already, and put out thy light, and is staining that which thou glories in, and is bringing contempt upon thy mothers Merchandize, of which thy shop is filled with books of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Arts, and made up in the Imaginations of men of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt minds, many of which is good for nothing but for the fire, which hath bewitched people from the simplicity of the Gospel, and hath darkned peoples understandings, and brought a mist and a cloud over peoples hearts, so that the Son of Righteousness could not be seen to arise in the hearts of people; and now thou (with the rest of Babylons Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants) which have long traffickt with their sorceries, art an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry because thou hast had a share in her Merchandize, and hath gotten gain by selling of such traffick, which is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>savoury salt, good for nothing but to be troden under foot of men, thou cryes like <hi>Demetrius</hi> for his shrines, <hi>great is the goddess Diana,</hi> and thou with others who have got a gain and trade by the aforesaid inchantments of the Harlot and her Merchants, thou cryes, <hi>The Church the Church, the Ministry the Ministry, and Religion,</hi> the National Ministry, which when
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99800:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the matter is enquired into, what the Church is, it is found to be no other then the Mother of Harlots who hath sitten upon the waters this many hundred years, and the Ministry is no other but them that are in <hi>Balaams</hi> way, and such whose hearts are exercised with covetous practices, and such as the Prophets and Apostles declared against, who sought for their gain from their Quarter, and who taught those things they ought not for filthy lucre; And for Religion, it is nothing but a profession in words at best without the life, or else some old traditions, humane inventions, and innovated customs, which hath been brought in since the Apostacy; but I say, because of thy gainful craft, thou art now busied as thou hath been diverse years, not onely against the Quakers, but against others who have separated from your hypocritical worships and deceitful formalities, and for this end thou hast bended thy tongue to tell lyes, and thy ear is open to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, that thou might get any thing to accuse the truth withal, and to set up and promote thy long trading with deceit, what, hath not the Hills and the Mountains, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Protectors formerly gratified thee, that thou art so covetous and greedy of persecution and blood-shed? Though thy insatiable desire hath not yet been satisfied, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I believe ever shall, yet thou shalt not go unpunished, and when Judgement comes upon thee, then may thou call to the Rocks and to the Hills to cover thee, and hide thee from the wrath of the Lamb, and from the presence of his holy Host, but they shall not be able to save thee.</p>
            <p>What, hath not all the Beacons that thou hast fired given sufficient warning to all the Dragons host &amp; to all the Beasts Army, and to all the Harlots Merchants, and to all <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons</hi> children, that they might come out all to battel? they have been fired these five years, hast thou not gotten all thy host up together by thy Books which formerly thou calledst so, to withstand the Lamb &amp; his followers, that thou art come on again with a fresh on-set to see if thou canst stop the way of Truth, that people might not receive it? for that is thy end in writing this lying History, as thou thy self hath confest, alas poor man, is this all thy strength that thou art able to make up, and are these all the weapons of thy

warfare, a company of vain Arguments out of the Priests Books which have written as thou hast done against the Truth, and old stories which thou hast received out of our adversaries writings which thou hast heaped up together to fill peoples minds which prejudice, that they might not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Truth? dost thou think this is like to prevail? a company of broken bowes and shattered spears, and lame Chariots, whose wheels have been often taken off, which we have over run and trampled down, that few will have any trust to these, or this is but to set bryars and thorns in battel against the Lord.</p>
            <p>Thy Book thou calls <hi>Hell broken loose, or a History of the</hi> Quakers, published to preserve Christians against formality of Religion and Apostacy, and to the intent that thy Book might not grow old nor stick upon thy hands, as such other mouldy stuff hath done, thou saith <hi>London Printed in the year</hi> 1660. and so hath Printed a lie in the Frontize-piece of thy Book, thy Book by that time thou may hang up with old Almanacks or sell for waste Paper, and if thou begin with a lie and scorn, how dost thou think that this will be an Antidote (as thou calls it) against formality and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy? Is not a lyar an Apostate, is not he that pleads for Popish Trumpery a formalist in Religion without the Power? he that reads but thy Title page may see what thy Book is within if he go no further, the Covenant of death is not yet broken in thee, and the agreement with Hell is not yet disannulled, and therefore all this smoak is come out of the pit in which thou delights to dwell.</p>
            <p>And is this such a worthy piece in thy account, that thou must needs shelter it under the wings of the Officers of the Army of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland?</hi> art thou so great a friend to them? and in thy Book tells them they were the in-let of Heresie and blasphemy, who art but yet an Episcopal stem, or at best a Presbyteral branch. I believe many amongst them will favour thy spirit, and know what uniformity and unity thou art for, which may be more properly called de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity and enmity, and so thy flattering Epistle when they see thy spirit will hardly merit thanks, and so that wicked spirit which could not be satisfied in the time of the former

Parliaments, and Protectors, still persists in the unfatiable desire to see if the Army will gratifie thee, and turn perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, but thou hast mist it far in crying a confederacy to the reverend Pastors or Priests of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Army knows right well or at least might do, that the Priests of <hi>Scotland</hi> whom thou so reverencest have been alwayes hinderers, and obstructors of the way of God and of his work these divers years, instance two or three hundred of them before the fight at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> who prophesied all like <hi>Zedekiah</hi> for the poor <hi>Scots</hi> against the English Army to go up and prosper; and cursed them and Excommunicated them, and gave them up to Satan and for distruction; but such Prophets were made fools, and their divinations was madness, and God gave a sufficient testimony against them and their deceived fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, wch I hope the English Army hath not yet forgotten, and for the Scotch Priests and their Doctrine and practice, 'tis so grosly ignorant and abominably prophane, as I believe many of the Army do right well know, but such as are not satisfied, I refer them to a Book called <hi>the Doctrines and Principles of the Priests of Scotland,</hi> wherein may be seen their deceit, and how some of them hath said they had reason to curse the Magistrates from morning to night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that allowance was granted unto any to worship God in spirit and Truth who could not be subject to their tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional uniformity; and thou tells the Army in thy Epistle <hi>that ruine is like to come upon all Religion and Piety, if God prevent it not by you or some other way;</hi> they may see what Religion thou art of, and what God thou trusts in, and what piety thou art for, which may be rather called irreligious and impious, the Government of Religion and piety lies upon the shoulders of him who is a wonderful Councellor, and mighty to save, and able to defend them that are subject unto him, &amp; would thou have the Souldiers or any others intrude themselves into Christs Throne, unto whom all power is committed both to make Religious and preserve pious them that do believe in him, this were to derogate from the honour and power which belongs to Christ who is head of the Church, who will not give his glory to another, and let all take notice of this that whosoever hath sought to take the honour
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99800:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>

            <p>If thou hadst said the Scripture is the Words of God writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thou hadst said something, for the Word of God is one thing, and the words is another, though the words are a Testimony of the Word, and the Word and the Spirit which is one, which gave forth the words, are the perfect rule and foundation of faith, which was before the words, and is greater then the words, as we have often declared to thy dearest generation though they would not hear; and where doth the Scripture hold forth a humane glorified body in Heaven? thy deceit and ignorant mind holds out a humane glorified body, we say according to the Scriptures that Christs body is spiritual, and he is raised a spiritual body, and is glorified in a spiritual body and in a Heavenly body, which thou never knew, neither art, like while the nature lives in thee in which thou now stands.</p>
            <p>And thou saith in thy Epistle <hi>that one day in seventh should be set apart for rational souls to mind the things of Eternity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And which is that day that thou wilt set apart? some of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylons</hi> Merchants have cryed up one day and some have cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up another day, and some have called the seventh day the Sabbath, and some have called the first day the Sabbath, and whether was Sabbaths made for man, or man for Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, and whether was dayes made for man, or man made for dayes? all time is in the hand of the Lord, and they that have Communion with him do mind the things of Eternity every day, and so they come to know the day of the Lord in which rest is given to the soul, and the creature hath rest though he labour in the Creation when that is done away in himself which hath opprest; thou may go learn what this means.</p>
            <p>In thy post-script (as thou calls it) thou saith <hi>if any shall take offence for thy seeking to civil or Military Power to support Religion,</hi> thy defence is, and thy belief is that thou <hi>ought to seek to the higher powers to support Religion, and this is the Liberty of

thy conscience,</hi> and that this thou may do <hi>more acceptably then they who cross their own profest opinion as they have done</hi> of late years <hi>by motions, Councels books and Papers which they have delivered for these many years for the pulling down the Ministry and steeple-houses, and that their importuning the Magistrate to pull down Ministry and worship is a yielding of the cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I say thy belief is without the true foundation, and so many properly be called unbelief, and thou errs in thy judgement, who seekes to civil or Military power to uphold Religion, which as I said before belongs to him who is the higher, and highest power; Civil and Military Officers are not for making Religion or setting up Religion, but are to keep the Peace, and to stop the violent doer, and to be a terror to evil works and workers, and a praise to them that do well, and that is their place to govern in righteousness, but not to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise Lordship over the conscience, which power belongs onely to Christ; and as for them who have delivered Books and Papers and words and writings to them who were in Authority to pull down the Ministry and Steeple-houses, or publike Ministry and worship, if thou intend the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> as I believe thou dost, thy arrowes being shot onely at them; we have delivered, or caused to be delivered divers Books and Papers, wherein we have shewed them the grievous suffering of the People of God, by the heavy oppressions which they did suffer under, because of the hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings wages and upholding of Mass-houses, things which hath been introduced since the Primitive times in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy, which aforesaid things hath been guarded and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by Lawes made in the Beasts power; now to make null those Lawes which were the ground of many oppressions, and an offence to many tender Consciences, this is not to pull down Religion, and that Ministry which can be pul'd down by taking away of Tythes and forced maintenance is no Ministry of Christ, but Ministers of Antichrist, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny paying to Steeple-houses, Clark wages, burying for the dead and such other like invented things, which many hath groaned under, is not to pull down Religion; for this I say to thee, and that which I can say to all, which no reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or equitable man will deny to be equitable or just, take the hireling Ministry to thee, and give him the fifth part of

thy estate if thou wilt, and erect thy Steeple-house like <hi>Babels</hi> Tower, but trouble not us with none of these things, and for declaring to the Magistrates that these things ought to be done away, and the Law by which they stood which was made in transgression ought to be taken away, this is not to pull down the Ministry nor true Religion, but to overturn deceit and Innovation which hath obstructed and hindered pure Reformation which hath been talkt on, for these are but the rotten raggs of the Whores Menstruous garment; so thy defence is made void and ours standeth true, that the Magistrate or Military power hath nothing to do to prescribe any form of Religion to bind all unto, for this is an intruding into those things that belongs not to them.</p>

I know thy envy in times past with the rest of the Priests was as much against them who were separate from your Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies as now against us, and all these things that thou hast racked up in this book out of Histories of <hi>Germany,</hi> of new <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which I am not credulous to receive from thy mouth, no more then I shall <hi>thy History</hi> as thou calls it of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> for thou which wilt lye of them which are so near thee, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port many untruths at a distance, and these things the hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Priests were wont to charge upon the <hi>Baptists</hi> and <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants;</hi> but now we are become the object of all your reproach and your butt to shoot at, but we are in that which the Devil cannot prevail against, neither the gates of Hell.</p>
            <p>In thy third Chap. thou saith, Thou wilt <hi>Treat of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors of the Quakers,</hi> and thou reckons up <hi>Simon Magus, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nander, Saturnus,</hi> how he taught that Marriage and Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was of Sathan, and <hi>Arians</hi> who denied the Divinity of Christ, and <hi>Pelagius</hi> a Monk who held that a man without the Grace of God was able to fulfil all the Commandements of

God, and of <hi>Balsidies,</hi> that he taught that it was not Jesus, but <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cyrene</hi> that was crucified in his shape.</p>
            <p>These are none of our Predecessours, take them to thy self; and whether hast thou not knowingly wronged us in these things, and how wilt thou make every thing good which thou hast charged us withal? These things foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned and many more which I shall pass over as not to trouble the Reader with, in which thou hast charged us falsly, wherein thou art required to make good the charge, or else cease thy clamerous tongue, these that thou hast reckoned up you use to call them <hi>Arians, Saturnians</hi> and <hi>Palagians,</hi> but now thou hast made them all <hi>Quakers.</hi>

            <p>And thou saith, <hi>It is high time for all the redeemed ones, and sanctifie ones, and Children of Grace, the Favourites of Heaven, honest, godly, sincere Christians, Children that will not lie to improve their intrust in God, for this sinful devided Nation.</hi> What dost thou own any to be redeemed and sanctified, or to be Children of Grace, or that doth not lie, and yet cryes out of perfection as Blasphemie, or that any should come to or live by that which is perfect; if thou exclude the Quakers to be any of these, they will not find many redeemed, sanctified, honest, godly, sincere Christians; and all your improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and your intrust which you have in God and in Christ will but amount to a small dram, you all of you hitherto as you have said, have improved your intrust, and hath sought God, as you have said, by your prayers and humiliations for the suppressing of that which you call heresie, and yet you have had no answer, neither hath he listned nor will he listen nor bow down his ear unto you because your hearts is full of abominations; and as for relapsing into Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, you never came out of it, witness the Priests Popish Ordination, their Popish Attire, your Popish Mass-houses, your Cross and Bells, your Popish Tithes, Easter-reckonings and Mid-summer dues, your Popish Colledges, your Popish Crosses and your Popish Images in and about your Idols Temple, and because of the holding up of these things, the hearts of many of Gods people are made sad, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you would hold up your Religion by swords and clubs, and persecute others who discent from you in this, you are one with the Papists; And is this all thy Reformation that thy godly Ministry can bring forth? You have travelled in vain &amp; spent your strength for
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99800:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nought, and because of these things the hand of God is against all in the Nation who hold them up, and who is he that can alter the Councel of the Lord? and God will not be reconciled to the Nation till these things be done away, because of these things and many more grievous oppressions which hath been holden up; therefore God hath broken them in the midst of their Councels, and confounded them in the midst of their devices, and will confound and overthrow all deceitful workers and unprofitable talkers such as thou art, and one hill shall fall after another till there shall be a great plain, that the ransomed of the Lord may walk over and worship the Lord together in spirit and love and truth, in joy and gladness of heart, even as when <hi>Israel</hi> kept the feast of Tabernacles.</p>
            <p>And now I shall come to let the Reader see how thou hast falsified our words which thou hast added thy own imaginations to, and then hath quoted our Books to make people believe they are our words when as they are thy own forged lies, the which I shall return upon thee.</p>
            <p>First, Thou sayes George Fox <hi>In truth defended</hi> saith <hi>that Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word Praying and singing are no appointments of Christ,</hi> when as he saith no such thing, but the hireling Priests divination and feigned Prayers and other mens words in rhime and Meeter are the inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men and not the Ordinances of Christ.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Thou saith E. B. <hi>In truth defended</hi> saith, <hi>The Priest taking Tythes in the time of the Law was evil, and proved them to be false Prophets and deceivers;</hi> When as he saith quite contrary, that the Priests took Tythes under the Law, according to the command of God, but <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow the Priesthood was changed, and the Law was changed; and them that Preach for hire, and seek for their gain from their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or take Tythes, are in the steps of false Prophets and deceivers, and no Ministers of Christ.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That its dangerous for the ignorant and unlearned to read the Scripture, and the Ministers of it are the Ministers of death;</hi> Now thou hast detracted from the words; There it is said that it is dangerous, for thee to take the Scripture to War against the Saints withal, and to make a trade with it, and give carnal Exposition and then sell them for money.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Thou tells of one Master <hi>Kellet</hi> in <hi>Lancashire</hi> and his queries; <hi>Whether did not Christ Institute his last Supper with bread and wine?</hi> and <hi>R. H.</hi> saith, The bread which Christ called his body is his Church, which words thou hast mangled and perverted, as thou hast done the most thou hath medled with, there is no such man as Master <hi>Kellet;</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:99800:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the words are these in <hi>Truths Defence, 103. Christ did not speak of bread and wine, but he took bread and brake it, and said This is my body;</hi> and we witness the breaking of the bread which is his body, and in this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, there is not one word of Church.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, <hi>E. B.</hi> In answer to <hi>Firmin,</hi> his words thou hast perverted, and would bring this as a contradiction of <hi>R. H.</hi> thou saith <hi>he allowes onely the wicked and ungodly to read the Scripture, such as the Scribes and Pharisees, and not the godly;</hi> And not the godly is thy own adition: he spoke concerning the Scribes and Pharisees who thought to have Eternal Life in the Scripture, he saith this was spoken to the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees, and not to believers, yet believers is not excluded from read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture, for them it pertains to and they understand it; but thou are like the Spider where the Bee gathers honey, gathers that which is corrupt, and in thy conclusion of thy story thou takes in hand to supplicate God; and thou saith it is <hi>for the help of them that need it,</hi> this thou might have spared till the old Prelates had come up again, it may be some Synod of them will add to the Book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer thy late service and worship; dost thou think the Lord will hear thy hypocrisie &amp; lies without returning his judgment on thy head? Thou tells of some <hi>that sets light of Christ and his blood and Word;</hi> thou art one of them that sets light of Christ and counts his blood as a vain thing, as thy own words in thy Book shall testifie, where the Reader may observe, when we have testified of the true light wch lighteth every man that comes into the world, who is the way to the Father, thou hath set down our words for blasphemy and errour, when divers of them are the words of Scripture, and none of them but the Scripture will testifie unto against thee; And as for the blood of Christ and the blood of the everlasting Covenant, thou accounts a vain thing and an unholy thing, even which cleanseth from sin and and bears witness against it, and subdues it, and makes them that receive it conquerers over sin, but thou that cries out against perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or freedom from sin, and counts this errour and blasphemy, <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hou denyes that which sanctifies and cleanseth from sin, and counts it unholy and vain, and so if the Lord should hear thee and grant that thou prayes for, destruction would come upon thee, and thou art one of the formal professors that had need to repent of thy deceit, before thou can pray unto God either for thy self or others; but enmity and wickedness lodges in thy heart against the Lord and the way of truth, and thou hast resisted the Counsel of the Lord against thy self; and therefore woes, plagues, thunders and storms is truely thy portion, and nothing else must thou expect, which undoubtedly will come upon thee, except thou repent, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99800:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it will be hard for thee to find a place of repentance, for it is yet hid from thine eyes. So I have answered thy lying History by which thou would inchant peoples minds, and have discovered thy deceit, and thy poison which thou hast put in that thou calls an Antidote, that so the simple may not be deceived with thy lies and cheats, neither the innocent betrayed; only I shall return a few of thy lies upon thy own head, which thou hath forged up against the <hi>Quakers</hi> out of thy corrupt heart, and out of the lying stories of the Priests, with whom thou art in league; but he that sits in Heaven laughs you to scorn, and all whose eyes the Lord hath opened, will have thy lying History in derision and lothe thy enmity, and testifie against thy spirit as not to be of God; And because thou hast said in thy advertisment to the Reader, that thou hath not knowingly wronged the <hi>Quakers</hi> in the least, I say thou hath either knowing or ignorantly wronged them, and both thou must repent before thou find mercy; and because thou tells the Reader thou will make good every thing thou hast charged against them to any who require it, I do require thee to make these ensuing things good.</p>

               <hi>FRiend,</hi> Consider what thou hast done: O how hast thou brought a vail of bad Report upon thy Name amongst all that fear God? And how hast thou hurt and wounded thy self by thy own wickednesse? and the Scripture is fulfilled upon thee; <hi>The wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the wicked shall slay him;</hi> What hast thou no better use to make of thy time, then to spend it with inventing Mischief against a despised people that seek not the hurt of any one, but thirsteth and waiteth for the glorious Appearance of the Son of God? and what thou hast sought to do against them, shall be the weight upon thy own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science in the dreadful day of God, whose heavy Judgments thou canst not escape. Alas for thee, poor man, thou feeble Child of <hi>Babylon,</hi> whose strength is weaknesse, &amp; whose wisdom is meer folly in the sight of the Lord; The Children of <hi>Zion</hi> do not fear thee, neither do they regard thy Revilings, for they dwell in a safe Habitation, and are at per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Rest, and are above all the fiery darts which in thy envy thou shootest against them, and thy reward shall be according to thy Works, and the multitude of men shall not be able to deliver thee from the wrath that cometh against thee from the Lord, and all the false Prophets and Wolves in Sheeps cloathing, with whom thou hast taken part against the Lamb and his followers, they shall be a broken Reed for thee to lean upon; for why? Alas, the determination of the Lord is against them, and the day of their Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is approaching; and hadst thou been wise for God, and for thy own Soul, thou wouldst not have indangered thy own Soul on their defence; And though we have no Goals, Prisons, Stocks, nor Whips, nor yet any unjust or cruel way of dealing towards you as you have had against us, yet we have the Lord to be our Armour, and he is the only Rock of our Defence, and he is stronger then man, and in him we trust; And what are all thy Lyes and Slanders unto us?

What is the Fruit of such a Work, but eternal Vengeance from the righteous God? And though thou art come in the end of the Battel, and hast helped <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> according to thy strength, yet <hi>Friend,</hi> our City cannot be shaken, its Foundation cannot be removed; And what art thou, vain ignorant Creature, that hast sought against God and his People?</p>
