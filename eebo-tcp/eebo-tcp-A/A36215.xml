            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </add> The DANGER of A COMPREHENSION.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>ANY Reaſons lead me to oppoſe a <hi>Comprehenſion,</hi> and the firſt of them is the very reaſon I pereive which others have given for it, <hi>That it fortifies the Church of</hi> England <hi>againſt Diſſenters;</hi> for ſince our <hi>Fear</hi> was of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to tranſlate it ſo early againſt Proteſtants of other Communions, is to tell them, that having rid our ſelves of Papiſts, we are making <hi>New Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies</hi> againſt them, and that we only halt a while to recruit our Numbers, and when in a poſture to attack them, they ſhall not fail to feel the weight of our Power and Comprehenſion. By this means, of very good Friends againſt Popery, we ſhall grow Parties and Enemies; and if this be not to be moſt carefully avoided in our preſent Condition, I am miſtaken both in my Religion and Politicks.</p>
            <p>
               <label>II.</label> But Secondly, What need is there of a <hi>Comprehenſion,</hi> which carries in it a <hi>Variation</hi> of the Old and Settled Methods of the Church, only to <hi>let in</hi> ſo many Men to Church Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; for when all is done, that muſt be the Mark they aim at, that preſs it on the ſide of the <hi>Presbiterian,</hi> ſince an <hi>Act of Indulgence</hi> would elſe anſwer that Gentleman as well: And if it were a Conſciencious Deſire on the other ſide to <hi>enlarge</hi> the Church, it would become a Duty with her to <hi>fling off</hi> all the reſt that others ſcruple, upon as good grounds, and which cannot be ſaid to be Eſſential to Faith or Worſhip, and ſo make but one Work of it for this Age. Since Conſcience therefore does not ſeem to be the Ground of this Comprehenſion on either ſide, it muſt needs have but an ill bottom to ſtand upon.</p>
            <p>
               <label>III.</label> We are not, nor cannot be aſſured, That the alteration this brings to the <hi>Church of England</hi> will <hi>ſtop</hi> here; for more Knowledge or Deluſion prevailing among themſelves or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, will call for the uſe of the ſame Prudence; and ſo ſhe can never be certain and ſtable, but ſubject to change with the Poſtures and Motions of Opinion or State.</p>
            <p>
               <label>IV.</label> It has ſomething in it of <hi>Irreverence</hi> and <hi>Levity.</hi> Two Churches to bargain about Faith and Worſhip, to take or leave, add or diminiſh, and both Parties to ſhew themſelves ſtiff or <hi>careleſs</hi> for the ſame things, as Humor or Intereſt govern them, which in Men pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Religion, cannot fail to ſcandalize thoſe that are not ſo Believing or Zealous as they ought to be.</p>
            <p>
               <label>V.</label> I conſider the <hi>very differing Temper</hi> of the Two Parties, whether it flow from Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Education given by the Authors or Founders of them, or the Influence of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, or that one has been uſed to <hi>Eaſe</hi> and <hi>Dominion,</hi> and the other to want the firſt and feel the laſt, or from all of them; but 'tis certain, there is a <hi>Latitude</hi> and an <hi>Hoſpitality,</hi> a <hi>Paſſion</hi> and <hi>Reverence to Majeſty,</hi> almoſt to an <hi>Implicite Obedience,</hi> in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and in the <hi>Presbiterian Communion,</hi> a <hi>Stiffneſs,</hi> a <hi>Meddling,</hi> a <hi>Cenſoriouſneſs, not ſparing their Superiours;</hi> naturally indeed inclined to Kings, but loving them as <hi>Boys</hi> do their <hi>Tops, to whip them.</hi> And it is this Diſpoſition that has ever made that Society troubleſome both to Church and State. Now as Men that are not of a Temper live beſt with one another at ſome Diſtance, ſo the <hi>Church of England</hi> will be leſs perplexed, and the <hi>Presbiterian</hi> leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled in an <hi>Act of Indulgence</hi> than in one of <hi>Comprehenſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>VI.</label> If the <hi>Comprehenſion</hi> be not ſtated upon an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of Practice, it can never endure. For look how many different Practices there are, ſo many Parties in a ſhort time there will be; and ſuch a <hi>Comprehenſion</hi> can only ſerve to break and diſſolve, inſtead of ſtrengthening, the preſent Church. Common Senſe teaches us, That one Enemy <hi>within doors</hi> is ſtronger than Ten without doors; and ſuch every perſon comprehended muſt render himſelf after a while, upon a differing Practice from the Old Standers of the Communion. If I ſaw more Piety and Charity in both Parties than formerly, I would forbid my ſelf this liberty; but when I find Paſſions as ſtrong, and Intereſt as prevalent on each ſide as ever, I muſt beg their pardon, if I ſav I cannot think their Notion of a Comprehenſion reaſonable.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Laſtly,</label> No body has ever yet ſucceeded upon this Deſign. It has been endeavor'd by great Men of ſeveral Perſwaſions at ſeveral times, as <hi>Caſſander, Cajetan, Eraſmus, Melancthon, Phlugius, Grotius, Salmaſius, Dury,</hi> and others, as well between <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> but ever to no purpoſe: and tho the Miniſters ſhould come in, their <hi>People</hi> would, in all probability, <hi>fall to their ſhare</hi> that are left out by this Act of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion. Wherefore I conclude, It is an <hi>Attempt</hi> that ſhews, in ſome men, more of Fancy than Judgement, and Intereſt than Religion; and that <hi>Iron</hi> and <hi>Clay</hi> will as ſoon <hi>cement,</hi> as our <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> and <hi>Presbitery,</hi> will or can <hi>joyn</hi> to conſtitute one National Church in <hi>England.</hi>
