            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO M. ROBERT HORNE, THOMAS STAPLETON VVISHETH Grace from God, and true repentance of al Heresies.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F the natural wisedome and foresight, M. Horne, described of our Sauiour in the Gospel by a parable, had bene in you, at what tyme you first set penne to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, to treate of the Othe of Supremacy: you would not, I suppose, so rashly haue attempted an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise of such importance. The Parable saith.<note place="margin">Luc. <hi>14.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>VVho is it amonge you, that minding to build a Castle, sitteth not doune first and reckoneth vvith him self the charges requisit thereunto, to see if he be able to bring it to passe, lest that hauing layed the foundation, and then not able to make an ende, al that see him, begin to laugh him to scorne, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, beholde: this man beganne to builde, but he hath not bene able to make an ende</hi>? The matter you haue taken in hande to proue, is of such and so greate importaunce, as no matter more nowe in Controuersie.</p>
            <p>It is the Castle of your profession. The keye of your doctrine. The principal forte of all your Religion. It is the piller of your Authority. The fountaine of your Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction. The Ankerholde of all your proceedinges.
<pb facs="tcp:18356:3"/>
Without the right of this Supreme Gouernement by you here defended, your cause is betrayed, your doctrine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solueth, your whole Religion goeth to wracke. The wante of this Right shaketh your Authoritye, stoppeth your Iurisdiction, and is the vtter shipwracke of all your Procedings.</p>
            <p>Againe, it toucheth (you say) the prerogatiue of the Prince. It is the only matter which Catholikes stand in, by parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t enacted, by booke Othe required, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> greate penalty refused. Other matters in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersy whatsoeuer, are not so pressed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, you haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon you to persuade so great a matter, first to a right lerned and reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Father, in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: and next to al the realme of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing this your Answer, as you cal it. The weightier the matter is, and the more confidently you haue taken it vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you, the more is it looked for, and reason would, that you did it substantially, lernedly, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d truly: and before you had entred to so great a worke, to haue made your reckoning, how you might bring it to perfection.</p>
            <p>But now what haue you don? Haue you not so wrought, that all your faire building being cleane ouerthrowen, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beginne (as the Ghospell saieth) to laughe you to scorne, saying: Beholde, this man beganne a great matter, but beinge not able to finishe it, he is fayne to breake of?</p>
            <p>You will say: These be but woordes of course, and a
<pb facs="tcp:18356:3"/>
certain triumphe before the Victory. Haue I not grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded this work of myne vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of holy Scriptures? Haue I not posted it vp with the mighty stronge pillers, of the most learned Fathers? Haue I not furnished it with a ioyly variety of Stories deducted from al the most Christian Emperours, Kinges and Princes of more then these .xij. hundred yeares? Haue I not fensed it with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicible rampars of most holy Councels both general and national? And last of al, haue I not remoued all such scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and stayes of conscience, as though it were, brambles and briers out of the waye, to make the passage to so fayre a Forte, pleasant, easy, and commodious?</p>
            <p>You haue in dede M. Horne, in owtwarde shewe, and countenance sette a gay gloriouse and glistering face vppon the matter: A face I say, of holy Scriptures, of Fathers, of the Canon, the Ciuill, and the lawe of the Realme, of manye Emperours, Kinges and Princes (for proufe of a continuall practise of the like Supremacye nowe by Othe to the Q. Highnes attributed) in the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Churches of England, Fraunce, Germany, Spayne, Italy, Grece, Armenia, Moscouia, Aethyopia:<note place="margin">Aug. de ci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uit.

               </note> But all is but a Face in dede, and a naked shewe, without Substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Truth and matter.</p>
            <p>It is like, to the Aples and grapes and other fruits of the countrey of Sodome and Gomorre, which growing to a full rypenes and quantitye in sight, seeme to the eye very faire and pleasant: but when a man cometh to plucke

of them and to tast, he shal finde them vnnaturall and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilente, and to smoder and smoke away, and to resolue into ashes. Such is the effect of your whole booke: It bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a countenance of truth, of reason, of learning. But coming to the trial and examination of it, I finde a pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ranke of most shamefull Vntruths, an vnsauery and vaine kinde of reasoning, and last of al, the whole to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue into grosse Ignorance. For proufe hereof, I wil short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay forth, an abridgement of your whole demeanour.</p>

foure seueral prints that I haue sene: two of Paris, one of Basil, an other of Lyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.

But seing his state is suche, that he presently can not doe it, I being by some of my frendes requested to trauaile in the matter, was at the first not very willing thereto: as for diuerse other causes, namely for that in very dede I was ful purposed, hauing so largely prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked suche sharpe aduersaries, especially M. Iewel, for a season to reste, and to stande at my own defence, if any would charge me: so chiefly for these two causes.</p>
            <p>First, for that many things in this booke pertaine to certaine priuat doinges betwixt M. Feckenham and M. Horne, of the which I had no skil. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dely, for that a number of such priuate matters touching the state of the Realme occurred, as to them without farder aduise, I could not throughly shape any answer. Howbeit afterward it so happened, that by suche as I haue good cause to credit, there came to my knowledge such Instructions, as well for the one as for the other, that I was the better wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to employ some study and paines in this behalfe. Not for that I thinke my self better able the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other, but for that I would not it should seme, that there lacked any good wil in me, either to satisfie the honest desire of my fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, or to helpe and relieue suche, as by such kinde of bookes are already pitefully inueigled and deceiued: or to stay other yet standing, that this booke be
<pb facs="tcp:18356:14"/>
not at any time, for lacke of good aduertisement, a stombling stocke vnto them.</p>
            <p>I haue therefore by such helpes, as is aboue saied, added my poore labour thereto, and with some diligence in the reste, shaped to the whole booke, a whole and a full Reply. Wherein I rather feare, I haue saied to much, then to litle. But I thought good in a matter of suche Importance, to be rather tedious to make al perfitte, then shorte and compendious, to leaue ought vnperfecte. Before then that thou shalt enter (good Reader) into the Replie it selfe, it shal be well, to take some aduertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with a certaine vewe by a shorte and summary compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, of the whole matter. Whereby bothe to the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersy in hande thou shalt come better instructed: and, what in the whole worke is to be looked for, thou shalt be aduertised.</p>
            <p>M. Hornes Answer, as he calleth it, resteth in two partes: In the first and chiefest he plaieth the Opponent, laying forthe out of the holy Scriptures bothe olde and newe, out of Councelles bothe Generall and Nationall, out of Histories and Chronicles of all Countres, running his race from Constantine the greate, downe to Maximilian greate gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dfather to the Emperour that nowe liueth, taking by the way the kinges of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, of Spaine, and of our owne Countre of England since the Conqueste, all that euer he could find by his own study and helpe of his frends, partly for proufe of the like gouuernement of Princes in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical causes, as the Othe attributeth nowe to the Crowne of Englande partly also for disproufe of the Popes Supremacy, which the Othe also principally intendeth to exclude. In the second and later parte he plaieth the defendant, taking vpon him to answer and to satisfie, certaine of M. Feckenhams Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentes and scruples of conscience, whereby he is moued not to take the Othe. Howe wel he hath plaied bothe his partes, the
<pb facs="tcp:18356:15"/>
perusal of this Reply wil declare. The doings of eche part, vpon what occasion they rose, thou shalt vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in our Answer to M. Hornes Preface.</p>
            <p>For the more lightsome and clere Intelligence of the whole that is and shall be saied to and fro, I haue diuided the whole Processe into foure bookes: keping the same order and course, that Maister Hornes Aunswere did leade me vnto. To the first parte of the Aunswere, wherein he layeth forthe his proufes for defence of the Othe, I Replie in three Bookes. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising in the firste booke, his Obiections out of Holy Scripture: In the Second, his Obiections out of the first six hundred yeres. In the third, his Obiections out of the later 900. yeares, vntil our owne dayes. Eche booke I haue diuided into seuerall Chapters, as occasion serued. In the seconde and third bookes, where we enter the course of tymes, I haue noted at the toppe of eache page, in one side the yeare of the Lorde, on the other side, the name of the Pope, Prince, or Councell, or other Principal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in that place debated: to thentent (Gentle Reader) that at the first sight euen by turning of a leafe thou mightest knowe, both where thou arte, and what is a doing: both the Age and tyme (which exceedingly lighteneth the matter) and also the Pope, Prince or Councel of that tyme. In these three bookes, what I haue particularly done, yf thou lyst shortly to see, at the ende of the thirde booke thou shalt find a briefe Recapitulation of the whole.</p>
            <p>To the second part of M. Hornes Answer, I haue replied in the fourth Booke. By perusing wherof it shal wel appeare, both what strong and inuincible Argumentes. M. Fekenham right lernedly proposed, as most iuste causes of his sayed Refusall: and also what seely shifts and miserable escapes M. Horne hath deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, to maintayn that obstinatly, which he ons conceyued erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously.
<pb facs="tcp:18356:15"/>
Especially this thou shalt find in such places of the fourth book, where thou seest ouer the Head of the leaues in this letter, <hi>The Othe: The Othe:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now good Reader, as thou tendrest thy own Saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest to be a saued soule, in the ioyful and euerlasting blisse of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider and weigh wel with thy selfe, the importance of this matter in hand.

               <hi>For no true Religion</hi> (saith S. Augustine) <hi>can by any meanes be receiued without some weighty force of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> Then if this Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whereby thou hopest to be saued, haue no Authority to ground it self vpon, what hope of Saluation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning in this Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> canst thou co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceyue? If it haue any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, it hath the Authority of the Prince, by whose Supreme Gouernement it is enacted, erected and forced vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee. Other Authoritye it hath none. If then that Supreme Gouernement be not dewe to the Laye Prince, but to the Spiritual Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, and to one chiefe Magistrate among the whole Spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lty, thou seest thy Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is but a bare name of Religion and no Religion in dede.</p>
            <p>Again, if this Supreme Gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t be not rightly attributed to the Laye Magistrate, in what state are they, which by booke othe do sweare that it ought so to be, yea and that in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce they are so persuaded? Is not Periury, and especially a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Continuance in the same, a most horrible and da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nable crime in the sight of God? And doth not Gods vengeaunce watche o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them, which slepe in Periury?<note place="margin">Malac. 3. Ero testis velox.</note>

            <p>Nowe if that Supreme Gouernement may dewly and rightly appertayne to our Liege Soueraigne, or be any Principall parte of a Princes Royall power, as Maister Horne stoutelye, but fondely auoucheth, or of his dutifull seruice to God, which neuer

            <p>But if these be suche Absurdities, as euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of any meane consideration seeth and abhorreth: then may not the Othe of any man that hath a Conscience be taken, neither can this Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Gouernement be possibly defended for good and laweful. That al these Absurdites and many yet more, which to auoide prolixitie I here omitte, do hereof depende, this Reply, gentle Reader, abundantly proueth.</p>
            <p>The Primacy of the Bishop of Rome, againste the which the Othe directly tendeth, (as M. Horne auoucheth) is euidently here proued, not only in our dere Countrie of Englande, as well before the Conquest as sythens, but also in all other Christened Countres, not only of all the West Churche, as of Italy, Spaine, Fraunce, Germany and the reste, but of the East Churche also, yea amonge the Aethyopians and Armenians. And that by the witnesses of such Authours, as M. Horne him selfe hath builded his proufes vpon for the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18356:16"/>The practise of the <hi>.8.</hi> first General Councelles, and of many National Councelles beside, in Spaine, Fraunce, and Germanye, hath pronounced euidently for the Popes and Bishoppes Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, and nothing for the Princes in matters Ecclesiasticall. It is now thy parte, Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Reader, not to shutte thy eyes, against the Truthe, so clerely shining before thy face.</p>
            <p>Againste the which Truthe, bicause M. Hornes whole An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, is but as it were a Vayne Blaste, the Confutation of that Answer, to auoide confusion of Replies, whereof so many and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers haue of late come forthe, I haue termed for distinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sake, a Counterblaste.</p>
            <p>And nowe, gentle Reader, most earnestly I beseche thee, of all other Articles, that be this day ouer all Christendo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersious, through the great temerite of selfe willed heretiks raised vp, most diligently to labour and trauaile in this of the Supremacy: As being suche, that to say the Truthe, in effecte al other depende vpon.</p>
            <p>Of Protestantes some be Lutherans, some Zwinglians, some Anabaptistes, some Trinitaries, and some be of other sectes. But as they all being otherwise at mutuall and mortall enemitie emonge themselues, conspire againste the Primacy of the See Apostolike: so a good Resolution ones had in this pointe, staieth and setleth the Conscience, as with a sure and stronge Anker, from the insurgies and tempestes of the foresaide rableme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and of all other sectes, and schismes.</p>
            <p>Contrary wise, they that be ones circumuented and decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in this Article, are caried and tossed, with the raging whaues and flouddes of euery errour and heresy, without staie or settling, euen in their owne errours.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:18356:17"/>But to leaue forayne Countres for triall, what it is to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat our selues from the See Apostolike, our owne domesticall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres maye serue vs for a sufficient example.</p>
            <p>At what time kinge Henry the <hi>8.</hi> first banisshed the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes Authoritie out of Englande, as the kinge and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thought, (though erroneously) that this doing imported no schisme nor heresy, so they thought likewise, in suche sorte to prouide, that the people shoulde not fall into the other er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the newe Lutheran or Sacramentary religion, which then the kinge and the Parliament no lesse abhorred, then they did Turkery. But what was the issewe, all the worlde knoweth, and England, the more pitie, greuously feeleth.</p>
            <p>For immediatly bookes came so thicke abrode, as well of the Lutheran, as of the Zwinglian secte, and the people fell so fast to a contentation and liking with them, that the king was fayne to make diuers streight lawes, and Actes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament for the repressing of heresy,<note place="margin">

Neither the Lutherans and Zwinglians onely swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the realme, but the Anabaptistes also, twelue of the sayed Anabaptistes being burned aboute one tyme.</p>
            <p>Nowe thoughe king Henrye altered no matter of fayth, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing this Primacie onely, but kepte constantlye the Catholike fayth otherwise, and though suppressing the Abbeys, he would not suffer religiouse men, that had vowed chastitye, to marie: yet after hys death, and in the minoritye of hys sonne kinge Edwarde, all the lawes that he had made towching matters of religion (sauing against the supremacie) were repelled and abolisshed. And a new religion was through out the realme set forthe.</p>

            <p>Againe, in the first yeare of our gratious Queene, the Acte of Parliament, for making and consecrating of Bisshoppes, made the .28. of kinge Henrye was reuiued. And yet the Bisshoppes were ordered not accordinge to the acte, but according to an acte made in kinge Edwarde his dayes, and repelled by Quene Marye and not reuiued the sayde first yeare. And yf they will say, that that defecte is nowe supplied, let them yet remember that they are but parliament and no Churche Bisshoppes, and so no Catholike Bisshoppes, as being ordered in such manner and fasshion, as no Catholike Church euer vsed.</p>
            <p>But thys is most to be considered and to be lamented of all thinges, that wheras no Acte of Parliament can geue anye suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient warrant, to discharge a man from the Catholike faythe, and wheras yt was aswel in king He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ries dayes by Acte of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as euer before, through out all Churches of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, sithens, we were christened, taken for playne and open heresie, to denie the reall presence of Christes bodye in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramente of the aulter (for maynteining of the which heresie there is no acte of Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t God be thancked, neither of king Edwardes tyme, nor in the tyme of our graciouse soueraygne Ladie and Quene that nowe is) yet doe these men teache and

            <p>All this haue I spoken to shewe it is most true, that I haue saied, that there will neuer be redresse of errour and heresie, or any staie, where men are once gone from the vnitie of the See Apostolike, which is the welspring and fountaine of all vnitie in the Catholike faith.</p>
            <p>And touching this question of the Supremacie, that we haue in hand, if we wel consider it, we shall find, that we doe not agree, either with the other Protestantes, or with our selues. For in this pointe, that we make the Prince the supreme head of the Churche, we neither agree with Luther him selfe, or his scholers, which denie this primacie: nor with Caluin and his scholers the Sacramentaries. Caluin saieth: They were blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers, that called King Henrie head of the Church: One of his scholers, Iacobus Acontius, in a booke dedicated to the Queenes Mai. blameth openly the ciuil magistrate, <hi>that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him selfe the Iudge of controuersies, or by the aduise of other commaundeth this doctrine to be published, that to be suppressed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe some of Caluins scholers, and our owne countriemen haue taken forth such a lesson, that they haue auouched in their bookes printed and publisshed to the world, that a woman can neither be head of the Church, nor of any Realme at all.</p>
            <p>Againe, manie of the Protestants though they will not, the Pope should haue the chiefe gouernement (because they like not his true doctrine) yet they thinke it meete and conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, that there be some one person ecclesiasticall, that maie haue this supreme gouernement for matters of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18356:19"/>It is also to be considered, that the wordes of the Othe nowe tendered, for the mainteining of the Princes Supremacie, are other, then they were in King Henries, or King Edwardes daies: with a certaine addition of greatest importance, and such as to a ciuil Prince, specially to the person of a woman can in no wise be with any conuenient sense applied: I meane of these wordes, <hi>Supreme Gouernour aswell in all spirituall or ecclesiasticall thinges or causes, as temporall.</hi> Such large and ample wordes were in neither of the foresaied Kings times put into the Othe. And yet had they bene more tolerable in their persons (for that men be capable of spiritual gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the which a woman is expresly by nature, and by scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded) then they are nowe. These wordes are such, I saie, as can not with any colourable pretext be excused.</p>
            <p>Neither is it inough to saie (as the Iniunctions doe) that the Quenes Maiestie entendeth not to take more vpon her, then King Henrie her father, or King Edward her brother did, what so euer that were, more or lesse: but it must be also considered, what she or her Successours may take vpon her or them by the largenes of these wordes (for an Iniunction can not limit an Acte of Parliament:) and whether there be any either Scripture or other good doctrine ecclesiastical, sufficient to satisfie their consciences, that refuse especially this Othe. Which doth not only, as it did before, exclude the Apostolical See, and all Generall Councelles also, as (though not in plaine wordes, yet in effect) in excluding the ecclesiastical Authoritie of al foren persons and Prelates: but doth further adioyne the foresaied newe addition lesse probable, and lesse tolerable, then was any other parte of the former Othe.</p>
            <p>And therefore certaine Protestants of some name and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation being tendred this Othe by commission, haue refused
<pb facs="tcp:18356:19"/>
it. Yea and how well trow you, is this supreme Gouuernement liked of those Ministers, which withstand the Quenes iniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions touching the order of semely Apparell, &amp;c?</p>
            <p>Thus ye perceyue, that as we are gone from the constante and setled doctrine of the Church, touching this primacy, so we agree not, no not among our selues, either in other pointes, or in thys very Article of the Supremacy.

            <p>TOuching certain Authors alleaged in this Reply, about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of our own Countre, it is to be vnderstanded, that of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne writen Copies not yet printed which we haue vsed, as of Henricus Huntingtonensis, and Gulielmus Neubrigensis, or Noueoburgensis, or Neoburgensis many thinges are in the said Copies, which seme not to be writen of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but of Some others. As in the Copie of Henricus Huntingtonensis, certayne thinges are founde, which seme not to be writen of him, but to haue bene ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of his workes, and to haue bene writen by some other: whom we coniecture to be Simeon Dunelmensis. Also in the Copie of our Neubrigensis many thinges are added both at the beginning and at the ende, which seme not to haue ben writen by Neubrigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis him self, but by some other. And that which is added at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, was writen as we vnderstand nowe of one Alphredus Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlacensis, who liued vnder king Steuen: The additions which do followe, who wrote we yet knowe not, except it were Roger Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueden. This I warne thee of, gentle Reader, to thentent that if he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reafter the foresaid Copies come forth in printe (as this very yere Neubrigensis did) and that the printed Copies haue more or lesse then we reporte out of the writen Copies, thou may not suspect any falshood or forgery in vs, but vnderstanding the case as we haue saied, maiest take our dealing to be, as it is, true and sincere. I here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hauing conferred the printed Neubrigensis, with the writen Copie, and finding some difference: as ofte as that which I alleage out of Neubrigensis, is in the printed Copie, so ofte I haue noted in the Margent, the booke and Chapter of that Copie. And when that I alleage, is in the writen, not printed Copie, I note in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent: Neubrig. M.S. for: Manuscriptus.</p>

               <p>I wil not charge M Horne, that his meaning is to ingraffe in the mindes of the subiectes, a misliking of the Queenes Maiestie, as though shee vsurped a power and autoritie in Ecclesiasticall maters, whereto shee hath no right, as he chargeth M.

But this may I boldy say, and I doubt nothinge to proue it, that in al his boke, there is not as much as one worde of scripture, one Doctour, one councell generall or prouincial not the practise of any one countrey throwgh owte the worlde counted Catholike, that maketh for such kinde of regiment, as M. Horne avoucheth, nor any one manner of proufe that hath any weight or pythe in the worlde to perswade, I wil not say, M.

Thirdly that albeit the Bisshop of Rome had no such vniuersal gouernment ouer the whole, yet that he is and euer was, the patriarche of Englande and of the whole weste Church, and so hath as muche to doe here as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther patriarche in his patriarkshippe. Then that all were it, that he had nothing to intermedle with vs nor as Pope, nor as patriarche, yet can not this supremacy of a ciuil prince be iustified: whereof he is not capable especiallye a woman, but it must remayne in some spiritual man.

Herevpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> incontine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Margraue of the towne, the chief Officer in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours absence, being sone aduertised by the Catholikes of some tumult like to arise, drew in al hast to the Church. But the brethren by this time were become Lordes of the Church, and had shut the dores against the Margraue. Notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding at length the Margraue going from doore to dore gat in, and approching to the assemblie of the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinists, willed and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Kings name whose Officer he was, to depart the Church, and not to interrupt Gods seruice as they had begun. Thei answered, thei came also to do God seruice, and to sing a few Psalmes in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, that being a place most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t therfore. Many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des passing betwen the Margraue and them, their number being great and increasing stil, the Margraue departed the Church, nothing preuailing neither by faire wordes nor by foule. The Magistrate being thus reiected (as vnhable in
<pb facs="tcp:18356:39"/>
deede to withstande the faction of the Rebelles, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared well euen that night) the holy brotherhode went to their druggery. First they song Psalmes, pretending that only to be the cause of their meeting there at that time. At their Psalmodie rushed in great numbers of people, some to see and be gone againe, some to remaine and accompanie them. I was my self present at the beginning of this Tragedy (coming by chaunce to the towne that afternone) and I saw after the Margraue was gone out of the Churche, and their Psalmodie begonne, not past (I verely suppose) threescore persons assembled. Mary there rushed in continually greate numbers of such as taried still with them. All this was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore six of the clock. From that time foreward, their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodie sone ended, they proceeded to sacrilege, to breaking of Images, to throwing downe of Aulters, of Organes, and of all kind of Tabernacles, as well in that Churche, as in all other Churches, Monasteries and Chappelles of Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werpe, to stealing of Chalices, to spoiling of Copes, to breaking vppe of seates, to robbing of the Churche War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens boxes as well for the Churche as for the poore. And heerein, I will reporte that whiche I sawe with myne eyes. In Sainte Iames Churche, the spoyle there being not so outragiouse, as in other Churches, al the settles, ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and seates, made aboute the Churche pillers and Aulters for folke to sitte and kneele in, were in maner left whole, one onelye excepted, placed at the west ende of the Churche, in the which were diuers little scobbes and boxes of gatherings for the poore. These scobbes lo, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, were broken vp, and the contents visited: for to them was their chiefe deuotion: All the reste remained whole, and vnspoyled.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:18356:39"/>To be shorte, al that night (which to him that had bene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent thereat, as I then was, might well seme <hi>Nox Siciliana)</hi> the Zelous brotherhood so folowed the chase, that they lefte not one Churche in Antwerpe greate or smal, where they hunted not vp good game, and caryed away fleshe good store. Chalices, patens and cruets of golde and of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, copes and vestiments of silke and of veluet, fyne linnen and course, none came amisse: They tooke al in good parte, and tooke no more then they founde. What shal I speake of the very libraries spoiled and burned, namely of the grey fryers, and of the Abbye of S. Michael? To describe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the horrible and outragious sacrileges of that night, an eternal docume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the ghospellike zele, of this sacred bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood, woulde require a ful treatise of it selfe. Only this much I haue shorthly touched, that you may see a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d palpably feele M. Horne, if any common sense remaine in you, what obedient subiects your brethern are, which with in <hi>.24.</hi> my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of their Princes Courte, which contrary to the expresse admonition of the Magistrat then present, contrary to all law, reason, right, or conscience, vnder pretence forsothe of your ghospels zele (the zele truly of Christes ghospell, was neuer such) feared not in great numbers to committe such open robbery, thefte, felony, sacrilege, and treason. But let vs procede.</p>
               <p>This Noble Strategeme was a way to bringe their prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinges within the towne walles: for now they had I trow, well deserued of the towne, and were right worthy of all fauour and libertye. Therefore the Thursdaye after, they preached openly in our lady Churche, and the Saterday in in the Burge Churche, and required to haue places in al the Churches to preache. But at the first two, and then fowre,
<pb facs="tcp:18356:40"/>
and at last all the Catholiks Churches being forebidden the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they obtayned yet certain places in the new towne to build them new Churches: which they did with great spede. The Caluinists builded foure, and the Lutherans two. This much grounde they gotte, by one nightes worke.</p>
               <p>But was it possible, that such a beastly beginning, should haue eyther long co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance, or any good ending? We shal see by the issue. In this moneth of August not in Antwerp only, but in Gant, Ypres, Valencene and diuers other towns in Fla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dres, Hartoghe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>buske, Lyre, and other in Brabant, in di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerse towns also of Holla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, in some in Zela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wel nere al these low cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tres, Churches wer robbed a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d spoiled, though in few so outragiously or so vniuersally as in the town of Antwerp. The storme of this sodayne spoiles being somwhat asswaged a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d stopped by policy a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d spedy resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, yet the new preachi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs took place about al towns: o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly Louain as I haue said excepted. this bei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly maide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> toun of any importance in al Braba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and Flandres, for being free both within and many a myle aboute, no lesse from al schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical preachings, then fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all sacrilegious spoiles. God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as I haue said, be praised therefore. But to procede, soone after these sacrileges, thei fel to ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t not foreward as it liked the Ministres, by their persuasions, townes began to rebelle, and to shut their gates against the Kings souldiars, which to haue iustice don vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and to stay farder enormities the Prince co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to be admitted.

               <p>This is lo M. Horne, the obedience of the Caluinistes in these low cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tres here, as we hear daily with our eares and see with our eyes.

By the Authority of Hermannus a knowen renna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate now in Englande, and a famous preacher here, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Italy for open baudery no lesse infamous, the towne of Hassels in Lukelande rebelled. By the encouragement and setting on of the Ministres (who for the time were the chiefe Magistrats there) the towne of Tournay for a season also rebelled, and sent out ayde to the rebelles of Vale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cens,

                  <hi>when by Tindall, Frith, Bilney, and other his faithfull seruauntes, God called England to dresse his vineyarde, many promised ful faire, whome I coulde name, but what fruite followed? Nothing but bitter grapes, yea bryers and brambles, the wormewood of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarice, the gall of crueltie, the poyson of filthie fornication flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing from head to fote, the contempt of God, and open defence of the cake Idole, by open proclamation to be read in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in steede of Gods Scriptures.

The bore I graunt was busie, wrooting and digging in the earth, and all his pigges that followed him, but they sought onely for the pleasant fruites, that they winded with their long snoutes: and for their owne bellies sake, they wrooted vp many weeds: but they turned the ground so, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling good and badde togeather, sweet and sower, medecine and poyson, they made, I saye, suche confusion of Religion and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, that no good thing could growe, but by great miracle, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der suche Gardeners.

<pb facs="tcp:18356:44"/>
For this Bore raged against God, against the Diuell, against Christe, and against Antichriste, as the some that he caste out againste Luther, the racing out of the name of the Pope. And yet allowing his lawes, and his murder of many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian souldiars, and of many Papists, doe declare and euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie testifie vnto vs, especially the burning of Barnes, Ierome, and Garrette their faithfull preachers of the truthe, and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the same daye for maintenaunce of the Pope, Poel, Abel, and Fetherstone, dothe clearelie painte his beastlines, that he cared for no Religion. This monsterous bore for all this, must needes be called the Heade of the Churche in paine of treason, displacing Christe our onely head, who ought alone to haue this title. Wherefore in this pointe, O Englande, ye were no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the Romishe Antichriste, who by the same title maketh him selfe a God, and sitteth in mens consciences, bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth the woorde of God, as did your King Henrie, whome ye so magnifie. For in his beste time nothing was hearde but the Kings Booke, the Kings Procedings, the Kings Homilies, in the Churches, where Gods woorde onelie should haue ben preached. So made you your King a God, beleuing nothing but that he allowed. I will not for shame name how he turned to his wonte: I will not write your other wickednesse of those times, your murders without measure, adulteries and incestes of your King, and his Lordes, and Commones. &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Loe Maister Horne, howe well your Protestante fellowe of the beste race, euen from Geneua, lyketh this Supremacie by plaine woordes, saiynge: that this title whiche you so stoutlye in all this your booke auouche, displaceth Christe, who owghte and that onely to enioye it. And whereas ye moste vntruely saye heere, that we <hi>make the Pope our God in earth:</hi> Maister Gilbie saieth, that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18356:44"/>
you make your Prince a God, in attributing to her this wrong title, wherin Christ wil haue no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>partener: Surely, we make no God of the Pope, and sometimes perhappes, no good man neyther. And yet we reuerence him for his office and authoritie, that Christe so amplie and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablie gaue him for preseruation of vnitie and quietnes in his Church. Your wisedome with like truth also appeareth in that you call the Pope <hi>the Archeretike of Rome,</hi> naming no man. And so your woordes so liberallie and wantonly cast out, doe as wel comprehend S. Peter, S. Clement, and other holy Martyrs, and Bishops there, as anye other. I promise you a wel blowen blast and hansomly handeled. With like finenesse you call him Archeretike, that is the supreme Iudge ouer all Heretikes and heresies too, and that hath already iudged you and your Patriarches for Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheritikes. I wisse as well might the fellon at the barre in Westmynster hall to saue his life, if it mighte be, call the Iudge the strongest theef of all: and doubtles (had he a Prince on his side) his plea were as good as youres is: Now where ye say, <hi>we would haue the Pope to raigne here in the Quenes place,</hi> procedeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your lik truth a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wisedom.

As did in our Countrie since the conquest Henrie the second, the sonne of Maude th'Empresse, daughter to King Henrie the firste. As did Phillipp, Charles the late Emperours Father, holde Burgundie, and Charles him selfe the Kingdom of Spaine. I here omit now Petronilla the Prince of the Arragones, Maude of Mantua, bothe Iones of Naples, Margaret of Norwey, and other women Princes els where, as in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre, and in Loraine.

               <p>The cause of his imprisonment then, as I vnderstande by such as wel knoweth the whole matter, was not abowte the ministration of the Sacraments, but towching the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Iustification, by onely faith and the fast of Lent: lyke as it doth appere in the Archbishoppe of Caunterburies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes,<note place="margin">The cause of M.

with your false daungerouse damnable gloses, where with you haue corrupted and watered the same, and made it as it were of pleasante wine most sowre vineger.

And then immediatly foloweth howe he shal busely read the sayde booke and so forth. If this order had of Late yeares ben kept, and that Princes and other had taken the Bible as it is, and euer hath ben, of the priestes of the Catholike Church (orderly and lawfully succeding one the other, as the Leuits did) reade, tawght, and expounded, as wel in Greke and Hebrewe, as in Latin, these errours and heresies should neuer haue taken so deape a roote , as they haue now cawght.</p>
               <p>Neither is this place onely meant, that the King should take the bare lettre, but rather the exposition withal of the said Priests. For what were the King the better or any man else, for the bare lettre, if he had not also as ordinary a waye for his direction, in the vnderstanding, as he had prouided him, for to receiue a true and an incorrupted copy?<note place="margin">Both, the boks of scripture and thex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position must be taken at the priests hands.</note> Where of we may see the practise in al ages in the Catholik Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che: whereof this place is the very shadowe and figure. For as the Protestantes them selues are forced by plaine wordes to confesse, that they know not the true worde or booke of God, but by the Churche: which from tyme to
<pb facs="tcp:18356:62"/>
tyme delyuered these bokes: euen so by al reason and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they should also co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse, that the Church can no more be deceiued in deliuering the sense of the saide word, then in deliuering the worde it self. Which seing they will not confesse (for then were we forthwith at a point and ende with al their errours and heresies) they must nedes conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new in the same.

               <p>Agayne Moyses was suche a speciall Prophet, and so singularlye chosen of God to be heard and obeyed in all thinges, that he is in the holy scripture euidentlye compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Christ him selfe: compared, I say, euen in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of teaching and instructing. Moyses in the Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronom foretelling the Iewes of a Messias to come, saieth:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lorde thy God wil rayse thee vp a Prophet from among thy own nation and of thy brethern such a one as my self, him thou shalt heare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this so spoken of Moyses in the olde Lawe, is in the new testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t auouched a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d repeted, first by S. Peter the chief Apostle, and next by S. Stephen the first Martir,<note place="margin">

to Christ. If the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ must so be heard and obeied of vs, as was Moyses of the Iewes, no doubt as Christ is a Kinge, a Prophet, a Priest and a Bisshop to vs, so was Moyses to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Prince, a Prophet, a Priest and a Bisshop. As Christ is of vs to be heard and obeyed as wel in al matters Ecclesiasticall as Temporal (for no temporal Lawe can haue force against the Law of Christ amonge Christen men) so was Moyses to be heard and obeyed of the Iewes in matters and causes as well temporall as spirituall.

               <head>The .11. Chapter concerning the example of Dauid.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>OTH M. Dorman and M. Doctor Harding affirme that the proceedings of King Dauid are nothing preiudiciall to the Ecclesiasticall authoritie:<note place="margin">Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid.</note> in redressing of disorders before committed, or doing suche things as are here rehersed. No more, then the reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Religion made by Quene Marie, as M. D. Harding noteth, which ye wot wel, imployeth in her no such supremacie. Beside that, it is to be considered, as M. D. Harding toucheth, that he passed other Princes herein, because he had the gift of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie. So that neither those thinges that the Apologie sheweth of Dauid, or those that yee and M. Nowell adde thereunto, for the fortification of the said superioritie, can by any meanes induce it. The scripture in the sayed place by you and M. Nowel alleaged, saith that Dauid did worke <hi>iuxta omnia quae scripta sunt in lege Domini:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Par. 16.</note> according to all things writen in the lawe of God. Wherevnto I adde a notable saying of the scripture, in the said booke by you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged, concerning Dauids doings by you brought foorth touching the Priestes and Leuites: <hi>vt ingrediantur domum
<pb facs="tcp:18356:68"/>
Dei iuxtaritum suum sub manu Aaron Patris eorum, sicut prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceperat Dominus deus Israel.</hi> Kinge Dauids appointmente was,<note place="margin">1. Par. 24.</note> that the Leuites and Priestes shoulde enter in to the house of God, there to serue vnder the gouernment. Of whom, I pray you? Not of King Dauid, but vnder the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of their spiritual father Aaron a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours. The gouernour of them then, was Eleazarus. Where we haue to note: first, that Dauid appointed here to the Leuites nothing of him self: but <hi>sicut praeceperat Dominus Deus Israël:</hi> as the Lord God of Israel had before apointed. Secondlye, that King Dauid did make appointment vnto them, of no strange or new order to be taken in Religion, but that they should serue God in the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, <hi>iuxta ritu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> suu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> after their owne vsage, custome and maner, before time v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Thirdly and last, King Dauids appointment was, that they should serue in the house of God <hi>sub manu Aaron patris eorum,</hi> as vnder the spirituall gouernmente of their Father Aaron, and his successours the high Priests. The whiche wordes of the scripture doe so wel and clearly expres, that King Dauid did not take vpon him any spirituall gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the house of God (namely such as you attribute to the Quenes Ma. to alter Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.) that I can not but very much muse and maruel, why ye shoulde alleage King Dauid, for any example or proufe in this matter. But most of al, that ye dare alleage the death of Oza. Whiche is so directly against our lay men, that haue not onely put their hands, to susteine and staye the fal of the Arke (as Oza did, for which attempt notwithstanding he was punished with present deathe) but haue also of their owne priuate autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie altered and chaunged the great and weightie pointes of Christes Catholike Religion: and in a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner haue quite
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:18356:68"/>
transformed and ouerthrowen the same, and so haue as a man may say, broken the very Arke it self al to fitters. Let them not dout, but that (except thei hartely repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t) they shal be plagued woorse then Oza was, if not in this worlde, yet more horribly in the world to come. As for that you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage of Dauid, that he made Psalmes, ordeined Priests, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites, fingers, and porters &amp;c. thinke you, he did al this and the rest of his owne authority, because he was King of the people? So you would your Reader to beleue. But the holy Ghost telleth vs plainly that Dauid did all this,<note place="margin">2. Par. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>because God had so commaunded by the hands of his Prophets.</hi> And thus you see, that by the declaration of the Prophetes, Gods Ministers then, as Priestes are now, the King did all those Ecclesiasticall matters, and not by his Princely authoritie.

               <head>The 13. Chapter concerning the example of King Iosaphat.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OV alleage for the supreame gouernement of King Iosaphat in spiritual matters (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy doth) the <hi>2.</hi> of Paralip. the <hi>17.</hi> Chapter. And as M.D. Harding and M. Dorman haue writen, so say I, that ye are they, which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent priuate hylles, aulters, and darke groues, that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture speaketh of. Wherein you haue sette vp your Idolls, that is, your abhominable heresies. We also confesse, that there is nothing writen in holy Scripture of Iosaphat tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his Care and diligence aboute the directing of eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical matters, but that godly Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Princes may at this day doe the same, doing it in such sorte as Iosaphat did. That is: to refourm religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Priests, not to enacte a new reli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which the priests of force shal sweare vnto. Ite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to suffer the Priests to iudge in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersies of religion, not to make the decisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of such things, a parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t matter. Ite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe a new forme and order in ecclesiastical causes, but to see that accordi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to the lawes of the Church before made, the religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be set forth, as Iosaphat procured the obseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the olde religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> appointed in the law of Moyses. Briefly that he doe al this as an Aduocat, defendour, and Son of the Churche, with the Authority and aduise of the Clergy (so Iosaphat furdered religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not otherwise:) not as a Supreme absolute Gouernour, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the vniforme co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent of the whole Clergy in full co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uocation, yea and of al the Bisshops at once. Thus the example of Iosaphat fitteth wel Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Princes. But it is a world to see, how wretchedly and sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Maister Horne hath handled in this place the Holye Scriptures. First, promysing very sadly in his preface,
<pb facs="tcp:18356:71"/>
                  <hi>to cause his Authours sentences for the parte to be printed in Latin letters,</hi> here coursing ouer three seuerall chapters of the <hi>2.</hi> of Paralip. he setteth not downe any one parte or worde of the whole text in any Latin or distinct lettre, but handleth the Scriptures, as pleaseth him, false translating, ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling them, and belying them beyonde al shame. He telleth vs of <hi>the Kings visitours, of a progresse made in his own person, throughout all his contrey and of Iustices of the peace:</hi> whereas the texts alleaged haue no such wordes at al. Verely such a tale he telleth vs, that his ridiculous dealing herein (were it not in Gods cause, where the indignity of his demeanour is to be detested) were worthely to be laughed at. But from fonde cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfeyti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, he procedeth to flatte lying. For where he saieth that Iosaphat <hi>commaunded and prescribed vnto the chief Priestes, what fourme and order they shoulde obserue in the Ecclesiastical causes and controuersies of religion &amp;c.</hi> This is a lewde a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a horrible lye, flatly belying Gods holy word, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which, in one that goeth for a bisshop, what can be don more abhominable? No No, M. Horne, it was for greate causes, that thus wickedly you concealed the text of holy Scriptures, which you knew, being faithfully sette down in your booke, had vtterly confounded you, and your whole matter now in hande.</p>
               <p>For thus lo, saieth and reporteth the holy Scripture of King Iosaphat, touching his dealing with persons rather then with matters ecclesiastical. <hi>In Ierusalem also Iosaphat appointed Leuites and Priests,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>Par.</hi> 19 8.</note> 
                  <hi>and the chief of the families of Israël, that they should iudge the iudgement and cause of God to the inhabitants thereof.</hi> How Iosaphat appointed the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites and priestes to these Ecclesiastical functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, it shal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the next Chapter by the example of Ezechias. Let
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18356:71"/>
vs now forth with the Scripture. <hi>And Iosaphat commaunded them saying: Thus you shall doe in the feare of the Lorde faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and with a perfect harte.</hi> But howe? Did Iosaphat here <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> 
                  <hi>prescribe to the Priestes any fourme or order which they should obserue in controuersies of Religion,</hi> as M. Horne saieth he did, to make folcke wene that Religion proceded then by waye of Commission from the Prince onely? Nothinge lesse. For thus it foloweth immediatly in the text. <hi>Euery <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> cause that shall come vnto you, of your brethern dwelling in their Cyties, betwene kinred and kinred, wheresoeuer there is any question of the law, of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, of ceremonies, of Iustificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, shewe vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they syn not against God &amp;c.</hi> Here is no fourme or order prescribed, to obserue in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies of Religion: but here is a generall commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King to the Priests and Leuits, that they should doe now their duty and vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faithfully and perfectly, as they had don before in the dayes of Asa and Abias his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and grandfather: like as many good and godly Princes among the Christians also haue charged their bisshops, and clergy to see diligently vnto their flockes and charges. And therefore Iosaphat charging here in this wise the Priestes and Leuites, doth it not with threates of his high displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, or by force of any his own Iniunctions, but only saith: <hi>So then doing, you shal not sinne</hi> or offende. The which very maner of speache, Christian Emperours and Kinges haue eftesones vsed in the lyke case, as we shall hereafter in the thirde booke by examples declare. But to make a short end of this matter euen out of this very Chapter, if you hadde M. Horne, layed forth, but the very next sentence and say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of King Iosaphat, immediatly folowinge, you shoulde haue sene there, so plain a separation and distinction of the
<pb facs="tcp:18356:72"/>

                  <p>First then, though M.

                  <p>Let vs then procede foorth, and consider vppon what good motiues, ye charge M.

But, as ye surmise, the one is, <hi>because he craftelye and by a subtill shift refuseth the proufes of the olde Testamente, as the Donatists did.</hi> The other, <hi>because he with the said Donatists shoulde auouche, that secular Princes haue not to meddle in matters of Religion, or causes Ecclesiasticall: nor to punishe anye man for suche causes.</hi> Surely for your firste motiue so fine and subtile a blaste of an horne, a man shal not light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye find againe among al the horners in England I suppose. But yet by your leaue Syr, your horne hath a foule flawe. When M Fekenham offereth to yeld, <hi>if ye can proue this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment either by the order that Christ left behinde him in the new Testament, either by the Doctours, either by Councels, or els by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual practise of any one Church,</hi> think you M. Horne that this is not a large and an ample offer? I wil not say, that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:18356:82"/>
this is subtyle shift, but rather a very blind, bytle blonte shifte of yours, to charge him with any refusall of the olde Testament, either openly or couertly. There is not so much as anye coniecture apparente, to gather this vppon, yea the olde Testamente is not by this offerre, as ye blindlye and blontly gheasse, excluded, but verely included. For if the new Testament, which reherseth many things out of the olde, haue any thing out of the olde Testamente, that make for this regimente: yf any Doctour, olde or newe, yf any Councell haue any thinge oute of the olde Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that serue for this regimente, then is Maister Feken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham concluded, yea by his owne graunte. For so the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour or Councel hath yt, he is satisfied accordinge to his demaunde. Whereby it foloweth, that he doth not refuse, but rather alowe and affirme the proufes of the olde Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente. And surely wise men vse not greatly to shew that, that maketh against them, but most for them. Wherefore it is incredible, that Maister Fekenham shoulde ons imagyn any suche syftynge or shyftynge as ye dreame of, hauinge wonne his purpose againste you euen by the verye olde Testamente as we haue declared. And therfore it is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken but in your dreame, when ye say, <hi>ye haue thereby with meruelouse force shaken M.

                  <p>Againe this accusation is incredible. For M. Fekenham him selfe is so farre of from this suspition, that he himselfe, bringeth in against you many and good testimonies of the old Law. (as fol. 109. and 123.) by the force whereof only he

Fekenham maketh no mention in this place of the matter to be proued by the old Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, therfore he subtillie refuseth the proufes thereof. But yee should rather me thinketh induce the contrary, and that he consenteth to you for the olde Testament: <hi>Quia qui tacet, consentire videtur:</hi> (as the olde saiyng is) For he that hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his peace, seemeth to consent: and so ye might haue better forced vppon him that all was yours, presupposing that ye had proued the matter by the olde Testament.</p>
                  <p>But you will needes driue your reason an other waye. Let vs see then, what we Catholiques can saye to you for your Apologie by the like drifte. You and your Collea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, seing your selues charged with many heresies, to wipe away that blotte if it be possible, and for your better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, take vpon you, to shew your whole, ful, and entier belief. And therevpon you recite the Articles of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Crede. But now good Syr, I aske you a questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: What if by chaunce you had omitted any one of them, would ye gladly be measured by this rule, yee measure M. Fekenham by?

Caluin writeth, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may laufully and by Gods law be put to death for heresie, as he practised himself also, burning Seruetus the Arrian at Geneua. But al Luthers schollers in Germany are not so forward. Yea some of your holy martyrs auouche, that the King ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> make no law to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish any maner of crime by death, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that al such lawes are contrary to the Gospel.

For the which your hansome holy dealing, the author of the foresaid Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie, and you, yea and M. Iewel too, are worthy exceding thanks. But M.

He hath placed a Note in his Margin, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (I trow) to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude his principall purpose. And that is this. <hi>The Princes Supremacy in repairing religion decayed.</hi> This is in deed a ioly marginal note. But where findeth M. Horn the same in his text? Forsoth of this, that Nicephorꝰ calleth th'Emperor, <hi>the mighty supreme, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d very holy Anchor, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d stay in so horrible wauering, &amp;c.</hi> Of the word <hi>Supreme ancher,</hi> he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth a <hi>Supremacy.</hi> But ô more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> childish folly! could that crafty Cooper of this allegatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, informe you no better M.

Was he no better sene in Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer, or in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a scholemaister, then thus fowly a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d fondly to misse the true interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the latine word? For what other is <hi>suprema anchora</hi> in good english, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the last ancher, the last refuge, the extreme holde and staye to reste vppon? As <hi>suprema verba,</hi> doe signifye the last woordes of a man in his last will: as <hi>Summa dies,</hi> the last daye, <hi>Supremum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium,</hi> the last iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, with a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the like phrases,
<pb facs="tcp:18356:99"/>
so <hi>Suprema Anchora,</hi> is the last Anchour, signifiyng the last holde and staie, as in the perill of tempest, the last refuge is to cast Ancher. In such a sense, Nicephorus called his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>the last, the mightie, and the holy Anchour or staie in so horrible wauering and errour:</hi> signifiyng that now by him they were staied fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the storme of schisme, as from a storm in the sea, by casting the Ancher, the shippe is stayed. But by the Metaphore of an Anchour, to conclude a Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: is as wise, as by the Metaphore of a Cowe to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude a sadle. For as well doth a saddle fitte a Cowe, as the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of an Anchor resemble a Supremacie. But by suche beggarly shiftes a barren cause must be vpholded. First al is said by the way of Amplification to extolle the Emperour (as in the same sentence he calleth him the sixth Element,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum sextum &amp; sempiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uum.</hi>
                     </note> reaching aboue Aristotles fift body, ouer the foure eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts with such like). Then all is but a Metaphore, which were it true, proueth not nor concludeth, but expresseth and lighteneth a truth. Thirdly the Metaphore is ill transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and last of all, worse applied.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas in the beginning of your matter, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of your proufes hereafter standing in stories, ye haue demeaned your selfe, so clerkly and skilfully here, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may hereof haue a tast: and by the way of preuention and anticipation, haue also a certaine preiudicial vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

which he geueth to the Quenes Maiesty, with copy of wordes, ful statutelyke, he leaueth yet out, and by that leauing out, taketh from the meaning of the Statute the principal cause ecclesiasticall, and most necessary, mete, and conuenient for a Supreme Gouernour Ecclesiasticall. What is that, you aske. Forsoth: Iudgement, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and approuing of doctrine, which is true and good, and which is otherwise. For what is more necessary in the Churche, then that the Supreme gouernour thereof, should haue power in al doubtes and controuersies to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the Truthe, and to make ende of questioning? This in the Statute by Maister Hornes silence is not compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.

                     </note>Yea, which is more notable the case standing in Aphrik, that as I said in many places two bisshops sate in one see to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, of thre hundred Catholik Bisshoppes assembled in a Councel in the sayde Aphrike, they were all, sauing two, (and yet those two relented afterwarde too) contente to geue ouer their bisshopricks, to the saide Donatists, yf they would return to the Church. And yet the Nicene ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons were to the contrarye. Nowe I pray you M. Horne, yf ye had bene then as Melchiades was, what would your wisedome haue done? would you haue stepped forth and haue said to Constantine, that he vsurped an other mans office? that he had nothing to doe in those matters? and that the matter being ons heard by him, it could not be deuol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into any other cowrte? and so not onely haue exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the indurate and obstinat Donatists, but also the good and godly prince, lately conuerted to the faith, and by this admonition thowgh trewe, yet out of ceason hasard all?</p>
                  <p>Nay, Nay, ye wil say, for al this Melchiades was but a mere delegate to Constantin, who lawfully and orderlye proceded in this case as owre prince doth now in like: and that this is but my prety shifte, and ye will put me to my proufes. But I hadde thowght you your selfe would haue proued hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a mere delegate, (seing you speak it so pere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely)

and that nothing was don here extraordinarily.

                     <hi>nomen Synodi suis actis praetexunt, quumres ipsa negotium Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratorium non Synodale haberi debeat. Quippe vbi Comes praesideat, &amp; milites Episcopos suo satellitio cingant, &amp; Impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toria edicta quos ipsi volunt coire compellant.</hi> These ioly Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebians (these were Arrians) to the intent they may blotte out the truth, and their owne writings, doe prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to their owne doings the name of a Synode, whereas the matter it selfe ought to be counted an Imperiall mater, not the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of any Councell or Synod. Loe Maister Horne, you with the Arrians, wil haue this to be a Synod: but we with the Catholique Bisshoppes of Egypt, Thebais, Lybia, and Pentapolis, and with Athanasius him selfe, denye flattelye it was any Synod at all, but onely <hi>Negocium imperatorium,</hi> a matter Imperiall, a ciuile matter, a laie or temporal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie. I truste we with the Catholique Bishoppes, and namely with Athanasius, shal haue more credit herein, then you M. Horne, and Maister Iewell, with the Arrians.
<pb facs="tcp:18356:115"/>
But why doe those Catholike Bishops deny this matter to be any Synodall or Councell matter? <hi>Quippe vbi. &amp;c. As in which matter</hi> (say they) <hi>the Countie,</hi> the Emperours Lieutenaunt, <hi>was president, and souldiours closed the Bisshops round about, and the Emperours proclamations compelled such to mete as them listed.</hi> Behold M. Horne, for this very cause that the Emperour and his Lieutenaunt bore the chief rule, therefore I say, did those Catholike Bishops accompte this matter to be no Synod at al. See I pray you M. Horne: <hi>Homo homini quantum interest, stulto intelligens.</hi> See howe farre square and extreme different your opinion is from the iudgement of the Catholike Fathers and Bisshops so many <note n="*" place="margin">Aboue 12. hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dret yeares.</note> hundred yeares past. You M. Horne and your fellowes, will haue al Synods and Councels to be called, ordered, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,<note place="margin">M. Horne clean co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>like Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Churche</note> gouerned, confirmed, approued and wholy gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Pri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and his officers. And without the Princes authority, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission, order, directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation, and royal assent, you wil haue no Synodes or Councelles of Bishops to auaile, or to haue force. Contrarywise, these Catholike Bishops in the East Church, do for this very cause reproue and reiect the Assembly of certaine Bishops, for no Synode at al, because al was there done by the authoritie, order, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and power of the Princes Lieutenaunt. And they doe make a plaine distinction betwene <hi>Negotium Imperiale,</hi> and <hi>Synodale,</hi> betwene an Imperiall matter, and a Synodall matter: as who shoulde saye, If the Emperour beare all the stroke, it is no Synod, nor so to be called.</p>
                  <p>Therefore these Catholique Fathers say againe, in the same place within few lines after: <hi>Si velut Episcopi sese Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices voleba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t esse,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>quid opus erat vel Comite, vel militibus, aut edictis ad coeundum imperialibus?</hi> If these fellowes would
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:18356:115"/>
be them selues Iudges as Bishops, what neded them to haue either the Countie, or the souldiars, or any Imperial Edicts to make them assemble? As who would say: In the Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iudgement, in the Synode of bishops, it is not meete ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be summoned by the Prince, or to haue his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt present, or to haue his gard of Souldiars. These mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters become the temporal Court, and the Ciuile Consisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, where by force of subiection, lawes do procede. They become not the Synods of Bishoppes, where with quiet of minde, with godly deliberation, freely and franckly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare or partialitie, Gods matters ought to be treated, discussed, and concluded.</p>
                  <p>Therefore againe these Catholik Fathers doe say of this Arrian Conuenticle at Tyrus: <hi>Qua fronte talem conuentum,</hi>

For these wordes he spake against the yong Valentinian, who being seduced in his minoritie, as our late Soueraine King Edwarde was, would haue the matter of faith to be tried in Palaice before him and his benche, as matters of faithe are nowe in the Parliamente concluded.

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:18356:133"/>
expressely in an epistle he wrote to younge Valentinian, this mans sonne. The forme of the law was this. <hi>In causa fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei vel ecclesiastici alicutus ordinis eum iudicare debere,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

Haec enim verba re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripti sunt, Hoc est sacerdotes de sacerdotibus voluit iudicare.</hi> That in the cause of faith, or of any ecclesiastical order, he should iudge, that was neither by office vnequall, neither in right vnlike. Those are the words of the Rescript. That is, he wil haue Priestes to iudge ouer Priestes. Thus S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose plainely and expressely in one sentence quyte ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth al M. Hornes supremacy.</p>
                  <p>Yea so farre was this Emperour from al gouernment ouer Priestes in matters ecclesiastical, that euen in matters ciuil or temporal, he woulde not suffer priestes to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the ciuil court. For thus it foloweth immediatlye in S. Ambrose. <hi>Quinetiam si aliâs quoque argueretur episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, &amp; morum esset examinanda causa,</hi>

                  <p>To returne nowe to Theodosius, and to you M.

You wil perchaunce say I borde with yowe, and am sette vpon my mery pynnes. I woulde to God the matter were suche as yt myght be better lawghed at, then pitied.

For this Archadius being Emperour

of the East, as Honorius was in the West, was exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated of Pope Innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tius for banishing of the said S.

The next narration seing it toucheth nothing, but matters of election, requireth no great answere: namely se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing M. Horne him self, hath made a sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t answer against him self. For if th'Emperour made a law touching th'electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Popes, at the Popes own desire, belike here was no great Supremacy: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no more then the Pope was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent either to geue hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or to suffer at his hand. Neither the banishing of both Popes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rome, especially in a schism, as this was, by M. Horne here specified, causeth any spirituall iurisdiction, the matter it selfe being mere temporall, as the matter of the election being (in this case) only begunne, not brought to perfection. Beside this, here is no presidente of our elections in England. For here is both the Emperors, the Clergyes, and the peoples consente in the Bishoppelye e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</p>
                  <p>I woulde nowe passe ouer to the next matter, sauing M. Horne here commeth in with his Glosatour and Glosar after such a cunninge sorte, lawlike, and gloselike, that it woulde not be to hastely lepte ouer. Firste he alleageth the Glosatour, as he calleth him, and that I am assured, is meante, and so to be proued of him that is the common expositour of the Canon Lawe, as appeareth by Maister Hornes owne allegations. But that he bringeth out of his Glosar, I am assured, is not to be founde in him that he
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:18356:144"/>
calleth Glosatour. And so haue we an other extraordinary glose by M. Horne now first authorised.<note place="margin">A nevve glose of the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> law, now firste au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorised by M.

Horne will needes haue him a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar (with the which perchaunce I will not greatly sticke, especially in that sence, as merely we call a Glosar in our tongue, that is a vaine lyer) and thinke he may truely so call him, I will not muche contende with him.

                  <p>For al Maister hornes declaration resteth in this, that he defended Iohn the Bishoppe of Antiochia, and a fewe of his confederates, the fautours of Nestorius, in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell condemned. Whoe made Cyrillus and the residew of the Ephesine Fathers (two hundred in number) heretiks, and called their doings hereticall, as euidentlye appeareth by the selfe same Authour and chapter, that M.

                     <pb facs="tcp:18356:149"/>Yet will M. Horne saye, that Theodosius practised this Supremacy here. First by the Earle Candidianus his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putie,<note place="margin">The cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses vvhy M.

Then, that after the said Iohn had condemned Cyril and Memnon, and deposed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from their Bishopriks, the Emperour confirmed Iohns sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. Thirdly that seing the dissension betwixt Cyril and Iohn to grow more and more, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded them to agree, otherwise he would depose and banish them both. Last of all, that Iohn being cited to answere before the Popes Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, would not come, but said, he looked for the Princes answere.</p>

Whiche, as we haue before saide, is one point of the Emperours dealing in Councelles, as the Churches best Sonne, not as Supreme gouernour thereof.

Wherein he is no principall worker, but an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutour of the sentence.

But hereof yt may be inferred that in Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels assembled for disciplin ecclesiasticall, and not for faith, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peror and his deputy haue nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to do: which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth the greatest part of your supremacy. And which is plain both by the rules, and by the practise of the Church expressed in the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels of Chalcedon, of Cabylon, and of Milleuitum. Now as we graunt the Emperours deputye may be present in the Councell, where matters of faith are in debate: so how he is present, and to what ende, and that he hath no authoritye to determyne and decide the controuersies, we haue alredy proued by Theodosius him selfe. To stoppe belyke this gappe, ye imagin Florentius to play the Iudges parte, as to <hi>examyne Eutyches openly in the Synod of his faith,</hi> and how he belieued. Examination Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentius vsed none, but as any lay man beside might haue don, he demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded what he beleued: which demaunding is not to determin, what and how he ought to belieue. Again where you adde, <hi>diuerse tymes of his faith,</hi> this is an other vntruth. For Florentius in al that Synode neuer asked him but one question (which you here alleage) and that after the Synode hadde nowe condemned him. But I suppose
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18356:152"/>
ye would fasten the Iudges part vpon him, because he <hi>sayd to Eutyches, he that doth not confesse in Christe two natures, doth not belieue a right.</hi> This might anie other ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue sayd to, and this is but a symple sentence. And as simple as yt is, ye thought not very simply, but dubly and craftely, yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together falsly, minding to beare the ignorant reader in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d as thoughe this had bene the final sentence. And therfore ye say, <hi>and so was Eutyches excommunicated, deposed, and condemned.</hi> But by whom, I pray you, Maister Horne? By Florentius, or Flauianus in the Councell? And when and howe, I praye youe? Did not the Councell before these woordes of Florentius, demaunde of Eutyches his faithe?<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Liberatus cap.</hi> 11.</note> Yea, did not they tell him? <hi>Thou must confesse this, and curse all doctrine contrary to this faith?</hi> Nowe when Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyches would not, and said, as ye say in many thinges, <hi>he would not, because the holy scripture hadde no suche matter,</hi> then did the Councel curse him: And after this curse Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentius spake the woordes by you rehersed. Afterwarde was he cursed again, and depriued of his priestly honour, not by Florenrius, but by his owne bisshop Flauianus, as it is conteined in the chapter by you quoted. Yea that more is, a playn place withal of the Popes primacy to. For both Flauianus sent this his Se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to Rome, and Eutyches thus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>playned by his letters vpon Flauianus, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, to Pope Leo. But <hi>Eutyches rested not here:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Popes pri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>macy pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued by M, Horns ovvn au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thor and chapter.</note> (saieth M. Horne) In dede in Eutyches we haue a paterne of you and your felowes, that wil be ruled by no lawe or order of the Church. This Eutyches being first three seueral tymes cyted by his owne bisshop and Patriarche Flauianus, would not appeare before him, but by the meanes of one Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saphius his Godde childe, a buskyn gentleman aboute
<pb facs="tcp:18356:153"/>
the Emperours preuy chamber, brought the matter to the Prince. Then a prouincial Synode being called by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and Eutyches condemned, he appealed from the Emperour to Pope Leo. Being by him also condemned, he woulde not yet yelde. No in the generall Councel of Chalcedon being thrise summoned by the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of 630. Bisshoppes, his pride and obstinacy was suche, that he woulde not appeare, nor being there with ful co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent condemned, would yet yelde thereunto. And al be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the .ij. natures of Christ in one person (which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied) was not expressely found in the Scriptures. In all these (except his only appealing to Rome) he shewed him selfe as right an heretike, as any that nowe liueth. But this is a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful foly, or rather madnes in you to procede on, and to alleage farder matter of Theodosius doinges for calling other Councels in the mayntenance of Entyches at Constantinople and Ephesus,<note place="margin">

And this maye be answered for the calling of many other generall Councels by the Emperours: especially of the firste seuen hundred yeares after Christ, when the Patriarches them selues were Archeheretikes, and the matters not like easily to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed by the Churche authoritie onely.

If ye thinke not so, as in dede ye doe not, then thinke you farre a wrong: And the <hi>godly and learned Bisshop Leo,</hi> as you call him, is able, if you be capable and willing toward any reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, sone to refourme your wrong iudgement. Who decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth expresselye, that euen the Councell of Chalcedo was summoned, <hi>by the commaundement of the Emperours, with the consent of the See Apostolique.</hi> Surely it was a rule and a Canon in the Church, aboue .12. hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred yeares now past, <hi>that no Councell could be kept</hi> (as Socrates witnesseth) <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the authoritie of the Bisshop of Rome:</hi> And that by a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall prerogatiue and priuilege of that See. This preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Leo also doth signify, speaking of this Emperour Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, who called the Chalcedon Councel, but yet, saith he,

The Fathers on the other side, thought not best to exact the rigour and extremitie of the Canons, but seing these fiue were hartely penitent, and had subscribed to the Epistle of Leo, whiche before they refused, and for feare of a great schisme, as Liberatus noteth, that happely might by this rigorouse dealing ensue, toke the milder way, and suffred them to remaine in their dignitie, and in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell with them. See now M. Horne, if this be not rather a mist then a muste, a darke mist, I say, mete for theues as Homer saith, and not mete, as he saith, nor acceptable to the shepheard. How vnmete then for you M. Horne, that taketh vpn you to be the shepheard and pastor of so many thousand soules, that should kepe your flocke, from al such hurtefull mystes of false doctrine?

And the forme of faith after a sorte was agreed vpon, but not in such sorte as in the Popes letters it was conceiued. And against the foorme of the Popes letters all the Bisshoppes of Aegypt, of Asia, of Illiricum, Ponthus and Thracia, very hotlye resisted, affirming that the definition was otherwise per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect enoughe. Which the Romaines and certaine of the Easte Bisshppes as earnestly denied.

                  <p>Had Maister Horne and his fellowes bene in that case, they woulde haue cryed: <hi>what haue we to doe with Rome, or with that forayne Prelate, the Pope?</hi> But the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes and Fathers of those dayes knewe a better obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the See Apostolike.

as the Emperour and the Popes Legates before threatned, <hi>they should al haue trotted to Rome, and there haue finished the Councel.</hi> Such was the Authority and preeminence of that Apostolike See of Rome, and so wel declared in this fifte Action out of which M.

Thow seest nowe gentle Reader, that by the prince his owne confession, by the Legates protestation, and by the ende and yssue of the whole Action, the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority rested in the Church of Rome, and in a Councel to be had there, in case they would not presently agree.

Fathers confessing your physical supremacy is not worth one pipte nutte.

by your ciuill and parliament authoritie, seing that the Emperours Valentinia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Marcian write, that <hi>those Bisshops can not by themperours lawe be conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  </hi>? Many things else are to be saied out of this Session, but I wil breake of, and shortly ronne ouer the residewe: noting this only for the .4. Session, that it is there declared, that Dioscorus was depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated to, by the Popes Legates and the Councel: <hi>the Emperours deputies,</hi> which in all other Sessions were present, <hi>being then absent, and without themperours or their knowledge.</hi> Which geueth a checke mate to all your supremacy, and to all your booke withall: yea and that with a seely pawne of one only line. This is so declared as I say, in the fourth session: but the sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce passed against Dioscorus in the third sessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Dioscorus not daring to shewe his face, and <hi>requiring, that themperours vicegerents might be there presente:</hi> to whome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere was made, <hi>that when matters of correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and reformation are in hande,</hi> as these were (for Diosco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus was not condemned for heresie and matters of fayth, but for his disobedience against the pope, the councel, and the canons) <hi>neither the Iudges, nor any laye men owght to be presente.</hi> Which answere M. Horne, for all your heuing and sheuing, against the ecclesiasticall reformation, geueth an other paune mate also in one shorte sentence, to a great parte of your boke, and to al such ecclesiastical visitation as is geuen to the prynce, by acte of parliament.</p>
               <p>In the fyfte sessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a litle variance fell among the
<pb facs="tcp:18356:174"/>
Fathers for the framing of the final sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the Senatours said, that <hi>if they did not agree, a Councel should be kept in the west parties</hi>: meaning at Rome. The Bishops of Illyricum cried (as I haue before shewed) <hi>they that doe not agree, lette them trudge to Rome.</hi> In this session when they were all afterwards agreed, the final and resolute sentence of the matter in controuersy, with a denunciation of deposition and curse against suche as should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st it, is pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced by the Bishops, without any voice or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent of themperour, or of his age<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.</p>
               <p>In the sixt session was present Marcian thempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour with the noble and vertuouse Empresse Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheria, to whome Aetius the Archedeaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople declared, that nowe the discord lately rysen among the people in matters of faith, was pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified by the holy Councell: and then read to him their finall determination and sentence. Vnto the which sentence were annexed the subscripions of all the <hi>Bishops</hi>: And first of the Popes vicegerent, after the fourme of these woordes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Bisshop Paschasine President of the Councell, in the stead of my most blessed Lord; and the Apostolical Pope of the vniuersal Church, of the City of Rome, Leo, haue determined, consented and subscribed.</hi> Then followe the subscriptions of his two colleages, one of them being no bishop: after who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Anatolius the Patriarch of Consta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinople, and so other Patriarches and bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops. Marcia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> seing the full and vniforme co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent of al these .630. bishops, doth allowe and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme their decree, and stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gtheneth it with a ciuill and politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t appointed against the tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sgressours. And in this properly resteth the Princes office and authority, in affaires ecclesiastical. In the seue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th session it is declared, that the election of Maximus bishop of Antioche was confirmed by Pope Leo. In the tenth Actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it ys openly auouched, <hi>quia mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si Apostolici semper in Synodis prius loqui &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmare soliti sunt.</hi> That the Popes legates were allwayes wonte in Councels to speake first and to confirme first. In the twelueth Actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the controuersy about the Bishop of Ephesus was ended by the Councel, not by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perours deputies, as it hath ben shewed. In the .16. and last Session, yt is sayde, that Rome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had the primacye: The whole councell sayeth to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour, that God had prouided for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible champion against all errours, meaning of Pope Leo. In thys session a greate parte of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thowghe contrarye to the Nicene decrees, auaunced the patriarche of Constantinople, to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie themperour making his chiefe abode there, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the patriarchs of Alexandria, Antiochia, and Hierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But the Popes Legates would not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to agree, no nor Leo him selfe: though the whole Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel besought him: but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed al other things that the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel had determined vpon: and caused Anatoliꝰ the patriarch of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinople, to surcease fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this his ambitious claime: and to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse his faut. Last of al in a letter of Paschasinus one of the Popes Legates in that Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel touching the conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation of Dioscorꝰ, this pope Leo is expresly called, <hi>Caput Vniuersalis Ecclesiae.</hi> Head of the vniuersall Church.

After the death of Acatius, succe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Flauianus, who woulde not suffer himselfe to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalled without the Popes consent.

Now as Emperours and Princes haue power (though not lawful) to expelle, and depriue men of the Church from their temporal dignities, and possessions: so to depriue a man of the Church from his office of ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to depose a bisshop or a priest fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his spiritual Iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Authority (which deposition only is a cause ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal) to the Church only fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom such Authority came, it belongeth.

Verelye, if M.

There should he haue founde most euident authorities for the Popes Supremacie vppon all states temporall and spirituall. He should also finde the same booke to be confirmed by .CC. and .xxx.

                     <hi>by a singular pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilege due to the See of Rome, because to that See, first the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d principality of S.

The Pope also him self being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, licensed the Bishops to examine his own matter. And a litle after: <hi>Affectu purgationis suae culmen humiliat.</hi> For desire of purging himself he hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bleth his high authority or dignity. Yet M. Horne addeth: <hi>the Synode presumed not to decree any thing without the Kings knowledge.</hi> Yf they had saied they ought not, then had ye said somwhat. But presume not, and may not, are two things farre a sonder. Though yet in one sense in dede they might not, nor ought not to haue proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the Kings consent, or without, against the Pope, who hath no Iudge in this world but God only: Neither ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he be iudged by his inferiours.<note place="margin">

And finally the King referreth the whole mater to the Synode, and plainly protesteth, that <hi>it was the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels part to prescribe what ought to be done in so weighty a mater. As for mee</hi> (saith the King) <hi>I haue nothing to doe with Ecclesiasticall maters, but to honour and reuerence them, I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit to you, to heare or not to heare this matter, as ye shall thinke it most profitable, so that the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in the City of Rome, might

And I praye you good Sir, was Saphoracus deposed by the Kinge, or by the Bishops? and was he as you say <hi>deposed for his iuste demerits?</hi> It had bene wel done to haue tolde vs, why he deserued to be deposed. But I suppose either ye know yt not, or else ye wil not be knowen thereof lyke a wyly shrewe. Forsurelye as farre as I can gather, yt was for that, he being a Bisshoppe vsed the company of his wyfe which he maried before he was prieste, contrarye to the olde canons, and a late order taken in the Councell at Orlyans .

And what bishop, think you, that she setteth in? No better surely then her selfe: that is, Anthimus the captaine of the heretikes of that time. But this geare goeth handsomly in and out, all thyngs I warrante yow in dewe order and proportion: euen in as good, as the matter is good it selfe. For nowe M. Horne, after he hath declared, that Anthimus was deposed from his bishoprike, is retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to shewe howe he was first ordered and made bishop. We haue then a tale tolde, to no purpose in the worlde, of Paulus the bishop and a murtherer, deposed, and well and orderly to, I trowe by Pelagius the Popes proctour, and so howe M. Horne frameth his primacy hereof, God woteth, I wotte not in all the world. For as for Iustinians commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to depose bishops, if M. Horne meane of such as Kyng Edward gaue in England of late, it is M. Hornes commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and not Iustinians. Neither hath hys author any suche thing.

                  <p>You goe on M. Horne, euer like to your selfe, and to your brother M. Iewel. For as at the first, you beginne with a great vntruthe, so you procede on with a greate manye moe. I meane not that ye cal the first for the fifte, lette the printer beare this, but for the residewe ye must take it vpon your own shulders. As first wher ye speake of the title: ther is no such title prefixed before the Councel: there is such a sentence in dede. But that it is a title prefixed before the Councel, as though this ordination were made before the Councel, and so should tel both the matters and who had the cheif authority in the ordering thereof, this is no simple lie. But euer ye shoote to farre, or come to short home.

The order of these sentences, as it is declared in the acts of the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel was this. First there was a sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople against Anthymus. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was there an other sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence geuen there against Seuerus, Petrus, and Zoaras. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was the constitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Iustinian (whereof ye speake) made and sente to the bishop of Hierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which kept there also a Councel and conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned Anthimus.

I was afeard, least ye would haue gonne about to proue, the people to haue song then, some such Geneuical Psalmes as now the brotherhod most estemeth: Wherevnto ye haue here made a prety founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, calling that after your Geneuical sort, <hi>the Communion,</hi> which the Fathers call <hi>the body and bloud of Christ:</hi> and the King him selfe calleth <hi>the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating of the body and bloud of Christ.</hi> Now here by the way I must admonish you, that it was not the Nicene Crede (as ye write) made at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople that was apointed to be rehersed of the people. The which is fuller then the Nicene, for auoiding of certain heresies: fuller I say, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning Christ conceiued and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnated of the holy ghost (which thing I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not tel how or why your Apologie, as I haue said, hath left out) with some other like.

Which the King strengtheneth by all meanes he coulde, yea with the subscription of his owne hande, because the other Kings his predecessours had ben Arians. Otherwise in the firste .7. Generall Councelles, I finde no subscription of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, but onely in the sixte, proceding from the said cause that this dothe, that is, for that his predecessours were he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes, of the heresie of the Monothelites: but not proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding altogether in the same order. For the Emperour there subscribeth after al the Bisshops, saying onely: <hi>We haue read the Decree and doe consent.</hi> But the Bishop of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stantinople saith: <hi>I George by the mercy of God Bisshop of Constantinople to my definitiue sentence, haue subscribed:</hi> after the same sort o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bishops also set to their handes. And this was because the mater was there finally determined against the Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelites. In case this subscriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil not serue the mater, M. Horne hath an other helpe at hand: yea he hath S. Gregory him self, <hi>that</hi> (as he saith) <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth Richaredus for his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in causes Ecclesiastical:</hi> and this is set in the margent as a weighty mater, with an other foorthwith as weighty, that this Richaredus <hi>called Councels, and gouerned Ecclesiasticall causes, without any doing of Pope Gregory therin.</hi> But by your leaue, both your notes are both folish and false. Folish I say, for how shuld Pope Gregory be a doer with hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being at that time no Pope, the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel being kept in the time of Pelagiꝰ .2.

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:18356:209"/>
False, I say: for Richaredus called not Councelles, but one onely Councel: yea and false againe. For there was no go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement Ecclesiasticall in Richaredus doings. Neyther is there any such word in the whole Councel by M. Horn alleaged, nor any thing that may by good consequence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce such gouernement. I say then further, ye doe moste impudently, in going about to make your Readers belieue, that Richaredus and other Princes after him, were take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for Supreme heades of the Church, till now in these later dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: and most blasphemously in calling the Pope, for this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the childe of perdition. As wel might you for this cause haue called Gregorie so too. Who is surnamed, as ye here write, the Great. But God wotteth, and the more pitie, not very great with you and your fellowes. Of al bookes, his writinges beare most ful and plaine testimonie, for the Popes singular praeeminence: whiche thing is in an other place by me largely proued, that though the matter here semeth to require somewhat to be said, I neede not say any thing,<note place="margin">See the 4.

Forsothe that the King Richaredus <hi>by his carefull and continuall prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, brought Arrians into the true faith.</hi> S. Gregorie saith wel. And yet you wil not (I trow) say: The Prince himself preached in pulpit to the Arrians. What then? Verelye that which he did by his Clergie, and to the which he was a godly promoter, that he is saied to doe him selfe. As to preache, to conuert heretiques, to decree this or that, and briefely to gouerne in causes Ecclesiastical. All which the Prince in his owne person or of his owne authority, neuer

Hornes arguments, for such proufes as he pretendeth to serue him, for thinges don with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in those .600. yeares: I am in a great doubte and staye withe my selfe, what order to take for the residewe of myne answere. We haue gone ouer litle more then one half, of that parte of M. Hornes booke, wherein he taketh vpon him to be the challenger, and an apponente: and yf we weighe the nomber of yeares, in the which M. Horne taketh his large race and course, they yet remayne almoste a thowsande to those that be alredy passed. Yf we measure the leaues, almost the one halfe rest behinde to the nomber of .42. Beside the remnante of his booke, wherein he plaith the defendants parte. I speake thus much for this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

On the other syde, yf I should lightlye and breiflye passe yt ouer, perchaunce M. Horne woulde bragge and saye he were not, no nor coulde be answered.</p>
                  <p>But yet bethinkinge my selfe well vppon the matter, the compendiouse waye seemeth to me at this tyme beste. Wherein I could be so shorte and compendiouse, that with one lyne, I shoulde sufficiently discharge my selfe for the whole answere, in saying shortly, but truely, that there is not, no not one onely authority apte and fyt to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude his purpose.

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:18356:214" rendition="simple:additions"/>
because M. Iewel with other his fellowes groundeth him self vppon yt, as a good and a peremptorye exception, I might boldly say, M. Horne, al your proufes after Gregory come to late: your .600. yeres are empted, spente, and gone.</p>
                  <p>Again I might and truly, seing that his pretensed proufes, of the first sixe hundred yeares are so faint and weake, yea seing that he is quyte borne downe, with his own authors, in the same booke, chapter, leafe, and somtyme line to, that him self alleageth: say, that either it is most likelye, that he cannot bring any good or substancial matter, for the latter 900. yeares, or what so euer yt be, it must yeld and geue place, to the Fathers of the first sixe hundred yeares. And with this answere might we, contemning and neglecting al his long ragmans rolle, that hereafter followeth, set vppon him an other while, and see how valiantly he wil defende his owne heade. Which God wote he will full faynte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye doe.

Wherefore yf hereafter he bringe any accustomed or stale marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, yt shall passe: but yf any fyne freshe, farre sought, and farre bowght marchandize come, we will geue him the lokinge on, and now and then cope withe him to.

But your conceytes haue deceyued you. For the legat of pope Agatho in that Councel, so familiar a frend of his, and so much by him honoured, was one Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus, <hi>presbyter Rauennas,</hi> a priest of Rauenna: as both in the life of Agatho,<note place="margin">

                  <p>With like truthe M.

                     </note> would forsake his whole clergy? But it is not possible for these lying superintendentes to tel their tales truly.

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:18356:221"/>
him: at what tyme by the meanes of the Exarchus, they brought him to Churche.</hi> The cause of this enmyty that the Clergy bore to him was, as Nauclerus writeth, for that he was a great almes man, and liberal of the Churche goods, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so very busy to kepe his Clergy in good order. For this cause they hated him, and in so solemne a daye vtterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soke him: Which is more, I trowe M. Horne, then <hi>not so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely to conducte him as the maner was.</hi> To lacke the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary solemnity, and to be cleane destitute are two things. And there is a difference, you knowe, betwene staring and starke blinde. I thincke your selfe M. Horne as holy and as mortified as you be, woulde be very lothe to shewe your self in S. Swithens Quyer at Winchester vpon a Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas day al alone, without any one of your Ministers as see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they are. Again where you say that <hi>Leo the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d made an end hereof causing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour Iustinian to shew great cruelty &amp;c.</hi> This is a very grosse lie.

For what other historians, what other Councels, what other Church can you shewe synce Christes tyme, then of very papistes? If you refuse the papistes historians, you must holde your peace, and let all this discourse passe, from Constantine the first, downe to Maximilia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> next predecessour to Charles the fyft. You must begynne only synce Luthers tyme: Which yet for very shame you haue clene omitted, not speaking one word, of

Charles the fyfte or of Ferdina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de his brother the late most renowmed Emperours, or of any their gouuernement in causes ecclesiasticall: whose examples yet you might as well haue browght, as of any other Catholike Emperour sence Constantines tyme, the first. But that in these, mens eyes and eares yet liuing, and knowing certeynely the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, woulde haue condemned you: In the other being out of the memory of men yet liuing, you thought you might by suche homly shiftes as you haue made with pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched false and forged narrations, worke yet somewhat with the vnlerned Reader, which trusteth you better then he knoweth you. If this be not true, tel me the cause Maister Horne, why coming down to Maximilian Charles his next predecessour, and to Lewys the frenche kinge next before Frauncis the first, yow come not lower to Charles him selfe, and to kinge Frauncis of Fraunce? Why I pray you, but for the reason aboue sayed? Well. If you had come lower, you might in dede haue founde prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant historians for your owne tothe. But nowe, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to haue a coloure of Antiquitie for your doinges, you are driuen to alleage onely papist historians, papist Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, papist doctours, papist Emperours. Brefely all your Authorities, testimonies and allegations, none other but of papistes. Yea the Scriptures them selues of whome haue you them, but of papistes? No merueyll therefore if you are so continuallye by your owne Authorities beaten downe. In the meane season, what historians, what Councels, what Doctours, haue you in any tyme of all the Churche, to speake any one poore worde for your ymagined supremacy? No, no, M. Horne. Either you
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:18356:224"/>
that nowe lyue are not the Churche of Christ, or ells Christ hath had no Churche, these thousand yeres and vpwarde. Either you must condemne so many ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, or they must condemne you. Would God our dere Countrie woulde ones consider this one reason, and worthely regarde the same.</p>
                  <p>To returne to you, Maister Horne, what moueth you to saie, <hi>that the Electours after longe altercation</hi> agreed on Conon, and <hi>Theodorus the Emperours Lyeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant gaue his assent,</hi> inferring thereof, that the Popes election still appertayned to the Emperours Lieutenant, and to hys assent? Your tale is myngled with vntruthe, and your consequent hangeth loosely. For firste alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the election of Conon there was none. Sabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licus your owne alleaged Author saieth. <hi>In nullo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam Pontifice creando maior extitit Ordinum consensus:</hi> There was neuer more agreement of all degrees in the creatyng of anye pope, then in this Conon.<note place="margin">

And thus your whole and onely proufe fayleth, whereby you would persuade vs, that the decree of Constantine the Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perour was so sone after abolished, or els not at al made, but (as you most peuishly talk) <hi>fayned of the Papist</hi> historia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: being yet al such, as wrote before Luther was borne, and

For why? As in the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon Councell it is writen. <hi>Missi Apostolici semper in Synodis prius loqui &amp; confirmare soliti sunt.</hi>

                  <p>By these and the like testimonies yt is cleare, that the Emperour himself, toke the fathers to be the iudges, in this controuersie, and most of al the Pope. To the which saying, it is nothing repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante, that Pope Agatho, according to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Letters, did diligently and obediently as well sende his own deputies to the Councel, as procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that other were also sent thither. Yes, saieth M. Horne: <hi>In those letters is manifestly confessed by the Pope him selfe, as wel the Emperours supreme gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

in Ecclesiasticall causes, as the Popes obedience and subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the same.</hi> This is largely spoken M. Horne. O that your proufes were as clere, as your asseuerations are bolde. Then were you in dede a ioylye writer. But M. Iewell can tel you, that <hi>bolde asseueration maketh no proufe.</hi> For howe I praye you shewe you this out of the Popes owne letters? You tel vs many thinges, that the Pope sent his legates, caused also other bisshops to repayre to the Councell, and woulde haue caused more to come, if great lettes had not hindered him. And all this you saie, <hi>to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme his ready obedience, for satisfying of his obedience, the studious obedience of his seruice,</hi> and yet ones againe, <hi>for the obedience sake which he owed of duty.</hi> Here is I trowe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience on the Popes parte, enoughe and enough. But here is not yet <hi>in ecclesiasticall causes:</hi> Here is not yet <hi>the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours supreme gouuernement.</hi> Here is not, <hi>subiection in the same,</hi> that is, in Ecclesiasticall causes. Then M. Horne hath affirmed foure thinges, and proued but one. And hath he, trowe we, proued that? Verely as well, as he hath proued the rest, of the whiche he hath spoken neuer a worde. For what obedience was this that the Pope so many times speaketh of? Was it any other, then that at the Emperours earnest request he sent his legates, and summoned the bishops to the Councell? Yes, will M. Horn saye: It was vpon the Emperours commaundement, that he so did, and not at his simple request. Then remembre I praye you the Emperours wordes before alleaged, in whiche he protesteth, <hi>that he can only inuite and praye the Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

you M. Horne, heare him speake nowe for him selfe. And that in the selfe same letters where he talketh so muche of <hi>Obedience,</hi> which you liked in him very well. I assure you M.

Lo M. Horn, you are I trowe sufficiently answered, if any thinge can suffyse you. The Emperour forced not the Pope by waye of commaundement, or supreme gouuernement (as yowe allwaies imagyne) but exhorted him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:18356:231"/>He proceded not by waye of oppression or threats, as by vertue of his allegeance or in payne of displeasure, but by gentle admonitions and requestes. So did al the good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours before procede with bishops in ecclesiastical mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: Constantin the first, Theodosius the first and second, Valentinian the first, Marcian, Iustinian, and nowe this Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantin the fyfte: not as with their subiectes or vassals in that respect, but rather as with their Fathers, their pastours and by God appoynted Ouerseers. The obedience then that pope Agatho so much and so ofte protested, proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of his owne humylytie, not of the Emperours supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy: of greate discretion, not of dewe subiection name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye in Ecclesiasticall causes. For seinge the Emperour in his letters so meke, so gracious and so lowly, he could doe no lesse (and the better man he was, the more he did) but shewe him selfe againe lowly and humble also. But when Emperours would tyrannically take vpon them in Church matters, there lacked not Catholike bishops, as stoute and bolde then, as the pope was humble nowe. So were to Constantius that heretical tyran Liberius of Rome, Hosius of Spayne, and Leontius of the East. So was to Valentinian the yonger S. Ambrose, to Theodosius the seconde, Leo the first, to the Emperour Anastasius pope Gelasius, to Mauritius S. Gregory. But M. Horne, if this do fayle, hath yet ready at hand an other freshe, iolye coulorable shifte: that the Emperour, euen by Agathos owne confession, <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied the place and zele of our Lorde Iesu Christe in earth, to geue iuste iudgement and sentence, in the behalf of the truth.</hi> Nowe are we dryuen to the harde wal in dede.

Or howe can yt be, but the whole or the greater parte of the churche, shall with the head miscarie also? Or howe ys yt true, that we heard at your handes euen nowe, that the churche of Rome was neuer caryed away with any errrour in fayth? Or howe is yt trewe, that ye sayd, that Peter had a pryuilege not onely for him self, but for hys successours also (which ye make the popes) not onely not to erre them selues, but also to confirme theire bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne, and to remoue all errour from them? We answere that in case the Pope by his open lawe and decree made with the consent of his brethern in Synod or consistory, promulged to be obserued throwghe christendomme, do set forth any heresy, that your replies are good and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall. But suche a decree ye haue not shewed, nor euer shall shewe. For, from making any suche lawe the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed hande of God doth vpholde, and euer hath vpholden, the popes for his promise sake. Promise, I saye, made to S. Peter, not for his owne priuat person, but for the safegard of the church, which otherwyse must nedes haue a great wracke in the fayth, if the Rock and head thereof shoulde publikly decree heresy. In case therefore the pope be pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately a close heretycke to him self, or to other to, without any open setting forth or proclaiming his errour by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon lawe (as Honorius was, if he were an heretike) he is not proprely to be called an heretike as he is a Pope, nor the church of Rome can be said to haue erred. Neither the other inconueniences wil ensue that ye brought foorth.</p>
                  <p>But verely what soeuer Honorius in his owne person was, yet certein it is, that the See of Rome both in his tyme

For a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Relike: not for a supreme dignitie. For a deuoute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce, not for a princelye preeminence: As you
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:18356:250"/>
moste fondelye and ignorantlye do pronounce. Yea and this you so folowe and pursewe from hence forewarde, as the very grounde and foundation of all the Supreme gouernement, whiche you woulde so fayne fasten vppon princes heads, a thinge of them neuer yet so much as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired or dreamed of.</p>
                  <p>For lo vpon this ioyly grounde you buylde and say. <hi>The heyres and successours of this Charles Martell, did keepe these keyes from rustinge.</hi> Verely I thinke in dede bothe he and his godly successours, vsed that Relike and many other deuoutely, and did not suffer it to ruste aboute them. A poynt for this relike, say you. I saie: <hi>They exercised the same iurisdiction and gouernement in Ecclesiastical causes, that the Emperours and kings had done from the time of Constantine &amp; caet.</hi> Verelye and so thinke I to. But you see nowe Maister Horne, at leste euery discrete Reader seeth, that from the time of Constantin hytherto, neuer Prince but heretikes, as Constantius and Anastasius wythe a fewe suche, gouuerned in causes Ecclesiasticall. Namely in al things and causes, as you by Othe make folke to sweare, I should say, forsweare.</p>
                  <p>But as touchinge thys Charles Martell, and Carolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus his sonne (whom you call his nephewe, and kinge Pipins sonne) and their gouuernement in Ecclesiasticall causes, gouuernement they had none, nor exercised none. You tel vs of such a thinge, but you proue no such thinge. The whole dealing of Gregory the .3. with Charles Martel and of pope Zachary with Carolomannus his sonne, was onely that they shoulde take the Churche of Rome in to their protection, (beinge then the moste mighty prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in this parte of Christendom) seinge the Emperours
<pb facs="tcp:18356:251"/>
of Constantinople had by heresy (as Leo then the Icono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mache) and other crueltyes, rather forsaken it and oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it, then succoured it, and defended it. And therefore of this facte of Gregory the .3. Sabellicus a moste diligente chronicler,<note place="margin">

VVherfore it hath seemed good for vs, to mooue you, ô ye pastours of Christes Churches, leaders of his flocke, and the bright lightes of the worlde: that ye wil trauaile, with vigilant care and diligent admonition to guide Goddes people thorough the pastours of eternal life, &amp;c.

And by reason of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, the Bishops of Reatina coulde not be consecrated, as M.

Then Gratian bringeth in diuers other decrees against the Confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Emperours, as of Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie the .4. pope: of Lewys the firste Charles hys sonne, Henrie the first, and Otho the first Emperours: who all

gaue ouer by open decrees this priuilege graunted first of popes vpon good considerations, and after repealed vpon as good by the same authoritie.</p>
                  <p>And thus you see, M.

                  <p>After this, M.

In this Oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Emperour three things I woulde you should note and beare well away M. Horne. First that the bishops (by his confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) haue power from God to iudge and determine in Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels. Their power and Authoryty herein procedeth not of the Princes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, as a supreme gouernour next vnto God aboue the bishops in ecclesiastical matters, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God him self, saieth this Emperour. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mperours power is a limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted power, not the chief, Supreme, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the highest in all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner causes a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thinges. Thirdly howe it is limited: Forsothe not to commaunde or prescribe to the bisshops what they shall doe, decree or determine in ecclesiastical matters, but to exhorte them to concorde and vnyty in the same.</p>
                  <p>In the seconde Action, diuerse of the Photians offering vp their libelles of repentaunce to the Synod, not to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:18356:279"/>
or his deputyes, were by the Synod with impositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of handes reconciled. In the third and fourthe Actions di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers letters were reade as wel of Michael and Basilius Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours to the Popes, Nicolaus and Adrian, as also of the Popes to them againe touching the condemnation of Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius intruded by Michael, and the restoring agayne of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius. In the fifte Action Photius was brought in, and the popes letters conteyninge his condemnation reade before him, vnto the which the whole Synod cryed. <hi>Recipimus haec omnia &amp;c.</hi> We receaue al these thinges, bicause they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to reason and to the ecclesiasticall rules and lawes. In that action also the Popes legates are called the presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of the Councell. In the sixt Action the Photians ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing agayne, and being moued as well of the whole Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, as of the Emperour, to repentaunce, they yet perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red obstinately in their schisme: Wherupon the Emperour gaue them seuen dayes of deliberation, after which time, if they were not in the meane while reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciled, he bad them appeare againe, saying. <hi>Ventura sexta feria in sancta &amp; vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersali Synodo state omnes, &amp; quicquid definierit vniuersa Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodus, fiet.</hi> The next Friday, be you here present in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vniuersal Synod: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d whatsoeuer the vniuersal Synod shal define or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, that shal be done, where agayne you see the Emperour iudgeth not in the matters then in hand,<note place="margin">

Yea he saieth plainely, <hi>that the restoring of Ignatius, was not his doing, or his deuise. But that longe before, the most holy and most blessed pope Nicolaus examining the mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter thouroughly, decreed by Synod, that he should be restored to the right of his See agayne, and together with the holy Romayn Churche, pronounced Anathema to all suche that should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siste that decree and sentence. And we knowing this before,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:18356:280"/>
saieth the Emperour, <hi>fearinge to haue the iudgement of the Curse promulged: Obsecundare Synodico iudicio Romanae eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae necessarium duximus, &amp; huius rei gratia reddidimus ei pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prium thronum.</hi> We haue thought it necessary to obeye the Synodicall Iudgement of the Churche of Rome, and for that cause we haue restored vnto him his owne See. Of such Authoryty was the Sentence of the Churche of Rome, with the Emperour of the East Churche in those dayes. In the same action he saieth yet farder. <hi>Hoc solum nostrum est si voluerit quis nominare crimina. Alia verò om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia Canonibus &amp; his, quibus imperiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Synodi creditu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> est, tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> This only is our parte to do: if any man will bring forth any crimes, or make anye accusation, to see it put vp to the Councell, &amp;c.

of them the truthe. But they refused to doe so. At the length the Emperour seing them obstinat and full of words to no purpose, sayed to them. <hi>Omnes nouimus, quòd laici estis, &amp; non adduximus vos latrare, &amp; sine ordine facere verba.</hi> We knowe all, that you are but laye men.

Eulapius is condemned and excommunicated of the See Apostolike: and therefore the Emperour ought not to talke with him. Then the Emperour sayed. I haue oftentimes and much desired, that they might not perish: And therefore I called them hither: but if they will not returne to the Church, whatsoeuer the Patriarches shall iudge of them, they shall, will they, nill they, stande vnto it.

                        <hi>Cusanus lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 23.</note> expressing the dewe zeale and dew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of an Emperour in al Synodes and Councels.

For this is the worke, saith he, of Bishops and Priestes. And after, comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the bishops for their greate paynes and trauaile in that Councell, he speaketh to the laye Nobylyte then present thus. <hi>De vobis autem Laicis, &amp;c.</hi> But as touching you that are of the lay sorte, <hi>as wel you that beare offices, as that be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate men, I haue no more to say vnto you, but that it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for you by any meanes to moue talke of Ecclesiasticall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, neither to resiste in any point against the integrity of the Churche, or to gaynesaie the vniuersal Synode. For to searche and seke out these matters, it belongeth to Bisshops and Priests, which beare the office of gouernours, which haue the power to sanctifie, to binde and to loose, which haue obtayned the keyes of the Churche and of heauen. It belongeth not to vs, which
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:18356:281"/>
ought to be fedde, which haue nede to be sanctified, to be bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, and to be loosed from bande. For of whatsoeuer Religion, or wisedome the laye man be, yea though he be indewed with all internal vertues, as longe as he is a lay man, he shal not cease to be called a shepe. Againe, a bisshop howesoeuer vnreuerent he be, and naked of all vertue, as longe as he is a bishop, and prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cheth dewlye the woorde of Truthe, he suffereth not the losse of his pastorall vocation and dignitye. What then haue we to doe, standinge yet in the roome of shepe? The Shepheardes haue the power to discusse the subtiltye of woordes, and to seke and compasse such thinges, as are aboue vs. We must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in feare and sincere faith harken vnto them, and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence their countenances, as being the Ministres of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye God, and bearinge his fourme, and not to seke any more then that which belongeth to our degree and vocation.</hi> Thus farre the Emperour Basilius in the ende and Conclusion of the eight generall Councell, and much more in this sense, which were here to longe to inserte. I blame you not nowe Maister Horne, that you so ouerhipped this whole Generall Councell, and the doinges of those .ij. Popes Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaus and Adrian .2. You sawe perhaps or had hearde say, that it made clerely against you. And yet as I sayed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, apparently you might haue culled out broken narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for your purpose as well out of this Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, as out of the other .7. But seing you tooke such paynes to note themperors demeanour in the former .7.

Adrians decree that the people of Rome shoulde wayte no more for the Emperours confirmation, was no defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge of themperours right, as you vntrulye reporte, but a renewing of the olde liberties and priuileges dewe to the Churche by the order of Canons and Councels, and the whiche neuer came to the Emperours, but by the Popes

                     <hi>The Pope complained</hi> (saith Nauclerus your own Authour) <hi>that liuing betwene the swordes of the Romaines and William of Sicilie, he was forsaken of the Emperoure, contrarye to his great promises, and so vexed for the Emperours sake, that he could not reast at Rome. The Emperoure on the other side, pretended many things, and namely the crowning of William the King of Sicilia, Iamque ad id vsque processum est, vt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perator nullum Rom. Ecclesiae legatum, &amp;c. And now the matter broke out so farre, that the Emperour co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded that no Legate</hi> and so forth, as in Maister Hornes Allegation. You see nowe, good Readers, it was no <hi>horrible vices of the Romissh Church</hi> as this horrible lying spirit of M. Horn prateth, but a priuate quarrell betwene this Emperoure and that Pope, that occasioned the Emperour to forbidde
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:18356:306"/>
appellations to Rome, &amp;c. You see howe this Cacus hathe drawen Nauclerus his woordes by the tayle into the lurkinge denne of his lying Conclusion. And that their fellowes nowe drawing nere to the others compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, the former ioyned with the later, haue euidentlye betrayed the notable thefte of this lying and theeuinge Cacus.</p>
                  <p>But Maister Horne, supposing the Emperour vpon such respecte had so done, tell vs, is the doings of this one Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, so preiudiciall to our cause, and so authorised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue al exception or plea, that because he did so, we must straightwaies co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse he did wel and laufully? Me thinke it were reason ye should proue this withal. Wel let this goe, we wil not charge you at this time so straightly. Yet this questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I must nedes aske you: Whether this was so done because he thought the Pope or See of Rome had no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, or for some priuate grudge and quarell not against the See and Pope, but against this Pope.</p>
                  <p>Yf ye will saye (as ye must nedes saye this quarrel was but a priuate and a personall quarrell, then is the ordinarie authoritie as yet nothing acrased hereby, but your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumente is then muche acrased. Yf ye will say, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, as ye now doe, all maner of authoritie of the See of Rome, then must I aunswere you: It is not so. For he was crowned of this Pope called <hi>Adrianus Quartus,</hi> an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe man: and submitted him selfe after to Alexander the thirde, as we shall anon see. And further I must answere you, that you are the verye Cacus we spake of, and that these stole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> allegations from Nauclerus do bellow wanting their companie, and doe discrie all your theeuish conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce as we haue before declared.</p>

The manifolde practise of the said primacy continued from this Kings tyme, euen to the tyme, and in the tyme of blessed S.

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that from the tyme of S. Augustine, the first Archebis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop among the Saxons, both he and al other Archebishops euen to the conquest receaued their palle from Rome: an infallible token of their subiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Pope, as Peters suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour, vpon whose holy tombe, the palle is first layed, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d after taken of, and sente to the Archebisshop.

It appeareth well both by Fabian and by Polychronicon, that he would sometime like a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>querour for his owne lucre and safetie, both displace the English prelats, as he did the Knights and Nobles of the realme, to place his owne Normans in their roome: and also haue a peece many times of his owne mind co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the precise order of the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and lawes eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical.

About a foure hundred yeres past, he was very busie, and to busie too, for his owne honestie with Spaine: nowe after this long taciturnitie belike he hathe espied out there, some notable matter for his purpose: And what is it thinke ye good Reader? Forsooth he commeth in, as it were in a Mummerie, and sendeth vs to <hi>Arnoldus de Villa Noua,</hi> and telleth vs that we shall learne by him of the doing of Frederike king of Sicilie, and Iames king of Spain, in their Epistles writen by the said Arnoldus. But what this Arnoldus was, Heretique or Catholique, what his bookes were, and where, and when they were printed, and where a man shall finde any thing of him, he telleth vs nothing.</p>
                  <p>Your brother Gesnerus, M.

                     </note> one hundred and fiftie yeares at the leaste, from the tyme ye shoulde haue orderly prosequuted, and as many myles from the matter yt self. For thys Arnoldus is noted to haue writen lyke a blinde and a lewde lying prophete, abowte the tyme of Clemente the fifte, which was made Pope abowte the yeare of our Lorde .1306. This Arnoldus then taking vppon him to be a prophete, sayeth that Antichrist should come within .34. yeres of his blinde prophesiyng. Now here for hys part M. Horne also playeth the lying prophete,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Imo quod deterius est videtur nobis quod pro nihilo habeant Ecclesiam Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, quia nulli ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellationi ad eam factae de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferunt.</hi>
                     </note> and telleth vs of wonderfull epistles that his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour wrote, one hundred yeares before he was borne: Whiche epistles though they be very highe and mysticall, yet there semeth to be no greate poynte of heresie in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And what so euer reformation these kings wente aboute, the epistles seme to geue a playn testimony, for the Popes primacy, and to fynde faulte with certaine religiouse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that they despised the Churche of Rome, and did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sallow appeales to that See. Yea where he telleth vs with a greate mighty assertion, and sayeth. <hi>Quòd concluditur infallibiliter, quòd Antichristus apparebit in mundo ab hoc anno Domini</hi> .1354. <hi>infra immediatè sequentes</hi> 34. <hi>annos,</hi> that
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:18356:323"/>
is, that it is an infallible conclusion, that Antechriste shall appeare in the world, within fowre and thyrty yeares im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly folowing after the yeare of our Lorde .1354. He sayth withall, that within the sayde 34 the Sarasyns should be destroyed, and the Iewes should be conuerted, <hi>&amp; iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictionem summi Pontificis per vniuersum orbe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dilatari:</hi> and that the authoritie of the Pope, should be spredde through owte all the worlde. Well, how so euer yt be, <hi>Arnoldus de Villa noua</hi> seameth not greatly to furder M. Hornes pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy. And it semeth to me that by ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he taketh one Arnoldus for an other.<note place="margin">

Your Brother Bale sayeth, that he was condemned, for that he sayde the clergy might vse no temporal iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And so thys Arnoldus might haue serued your turne for the tyme, and somwhat for the matter to after your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customable reasoninge, if the authority of heretikes maye serue the turne. But let Arnoldus a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Spayne to goe for this tyme. for M.

And though perchaunce some of these cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Maruayle nowe yt is, that M. Horne can not loke vpon the Grecians and Armenians, but with one blind eye bleared with affection to heresie and hatred to the Pope. Otherwyse yf he woulde loke vppon them with the better and indifferente eie, there were more cause whie he should regarde aswell the aunciente Greeke Churche which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the Popes Supreamacye: as also the later ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the same, in the generall councell at Lions: wherof we haue spoken, and also afterward in the general Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel at <hi>Ferraria</hi> and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slated to <hi>Flore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</hi> Where also the Armenians were ioyned with the Roman Church.

supreme gournours. Neither neded yow yet M. Horne to haue loked so far. For if your enuious eie might haue abidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our own late time, and the late councel of Trent, ye should haue found that the Armenians sent ambassadours to the Pope recognising hys supreamacy, and desiring the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of theyre patriarch of Antiochia. Ye should haue founde, that Abdisa the patriarche of the Assyrians inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting nygh to the famous floud of Tygris came to Rome, with no small eyther trauell or daunger of hys life, to be confirmed of <hi>Pius Quartus</hi> the last pope of blessed memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: who also promised as well for hym selfe, as for those that were vnder his spiritual gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that he and they woulde faythfully and constantly keepe suche decrees, as should be set forth by the saied Councell of Trent.</p>
                  <p>Perchaunce ye will the lesse passe for the Armenians, seeyng you haue on your syde, as ye saye, about thys tyme the greate prince of the Aethiopians hauing no lesse then 62. Kingdomes vnder hys Dominion, the same country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng the most auncient part of Christendome Southwarde. And because your selfe haue forsaken your priesthodde, (take heede I pray you, that ye haue not withall forsaken your Christendome) ye are not contented with the Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and other that call hym Prieste Ihon, as thoughe he were a prieste and head Bishoppe ouer those Christian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>almes, hauing suche a power wyth them, as the popes v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation (as ye terme yt) hath challenged here in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, to be an head or vniuersall priest or Kyng. And ye would rather he should be called as Sabellicus telleth, the mighty Gyan So called (as ye by a mighty lying exposition of your own falsly declare) because he is the supreme ruler and gouernour of all causes aswel ecclesiasticall as te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral.</p>

the setting forth of this Kinges storie, to lye extremely, to bring thereby the clergie into hatred and enuie: as in thys storie among other thinges he hath done,<note place="margin">A greate vntruthe of M.

                     <hi>Radulphus Niger,</hi> saying he died, of surfeting in the night: <hi>Roger Houeden,</hi> saying he died of a bluddie flixe: <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus Parisiensis,</hi> saying that by heuines of minde, he fel into a feruente agewe, at the abbey of Swinstead, which he encreased with surfeting, and nawghty diet: by eating pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and drinkinge of newe Ciser, or sydar. Then adde ye farder Maister Foxe that some saye he died of a colde sweate: some of eatinge apples: some of eating peares: and some of eating plummes.

These and many other things the Councell ordeined in this behalfe. The which decrees the Emperour Frederike confirmeth by his Emperial edict, adding perpetual infamie, exile, banishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, death, and the disheryting of their heires: and that he shal not be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for any officer or Magistrat, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that al his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces shal be void that wil not take the othe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid.

And this is the manner, M. Horne, of the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Heretiks, that ye speake of, appointed by your new supreme Head the Emperour Frederike. And so yee see withal, how you and your fellowes were to be ordered, if he now liued. What? Me thinke ye beginne, M.

               <p>And first to beginne with Almaricus, Did not his errors stand in the refusing of Images, Aulters, the inuocation of Saintes, the transubstantiation of the holy Eucharistia, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as your brother Pantaleon writeth, saying (which is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile) that he was burned at Paris for teaching of errours? A man may thinke they were errours in deede, that Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taleon will ones confesse to be errours. For the other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaide, he taketh not for errours, but for true doctrine. What errours were they then? One was, that if Adam and Eue had continued in state of grace, they should neuer haue had children by any carnal copulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but otherwise: Yea that there should haue bene no difference betwen the Male and the Female kinde. Secondly, he saied, that the blessed Saintes in heauen doe not see the essence of God. Whiche errour he learned of <hi>Petrus Abailardus,</hi> againste whome S. Barnarde writeth: and of <hi>Arnoldus Brixiensis,</hi> of whome as I suppose, <hi>Arnoldistae,</hi> of whom we spake of, be called. Thirdly, he said, that the bodie of Christ is no otherwise in the Sacramente of the Aulter, then in other bread, and all other things. Fourthly he said, there was no hell. Fifthly, he denyed the resurrection of the flesh. And yet is this Almaricus a worthy Bisshoppe, and an holy
<pb facs="tcp:18356:338"/>
Martyr, in Maister Foxes madde Martyrologe. Neither can he finde any matter why he was condemned,<note place="margin">

                  </note> but for teaching and holding againste Images, whiche if it were true, as it is false, yet were he but a starke stinking Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr.</p>
               <p>I will nowe vnfolde and rippe vppe the heresies of some other condemned by Frederike, that Maister Horne may see his own iudgement,<note place="margin">Articles of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

of S.

set vp for lying, ye adde for the with an other lie. Ye saye <hi>there was a tribute demaunded of all the clergy by the Legate: but yt was denied him.</hi> Your author saith, he demaunded the tenth of the clergie, to mainteyne warre against the Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens: and yt was sone graunted him. Your authour reciteth also, after the minde of some writers, that in a conuocation, Ottho the Popes Legate, demaunded a certayne yerelye paymente, which was denied him, but he doth improue those that so write. And so withal it is not a single but a double, or rather a treble vntruth, that ye write concerning this tribute. For this demaunde yf yt were made, was not made, <hi>at that tyme</hi> (as you say) when that Councel, that ye call the solemne Councel was holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and wherin the great Charter was graunted, and where, as ye most falsly say, yt was disanulled, but in a conuocation at an other tyme. Now putting the case there were any such payment denied, doth that spoile the pope of his supremacy? By as good reason ye may conclude, yf any thing be denied the King, that he demaundeth in the parliament, that therefore he is no King. This former answere may serue you also for that ye alleage concerning Robert groshead: sauing that I may adde this withall, that he were a very Groshead in dede, that would belieue you, either when ye say to M.

Whereby it wel appereth, that this allegation maketh rather with the Popes Primacy, then against it: but most of all in this place. For Pope Alexander the .4. declared this Manfredus the Romain Churches enemy, as he was in dede, and a traytour also both to Conradus, his brother, and to Conradinus his nephewe, both inheritours to that kingdome, both whome he went about to poyson. By reason of which outrages, he was as I said denounced enemy to the Church of Rome by Alexander the .4. and shortly after, Charles Kinge Lewys his brother, was made King of Sicilie by Clemens the .4. paying to the Pope a tribute, and holding of him by faithe and homage. Such Supreme heads were your Conradus, Conradinus and Manfredus.</p>
                  <p>As for Charles (who only by the Popes Authority came to that dignity, as I haue said) it is not true, that he (as you say, <hi>had all or most of the doing, in the election, or making of diuerse Popes</hi> For the Cardinalls only had the whole doing.

Yf Mortmaine had bene so straightly sene vnto, some hundred yeares before, ye should haue fownde your reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes, I suppose, very slender and poore. But ye beinge as good a Lawier as ye be, either diuine, or Chronicler, think belyke your self to be out of the go<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neshotte, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine reacheth onely to men of relligion. And yt semeth, so he and his mate may be wel prouided for, M. Horne for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth litle, howe litle other haue, and whether they haue ought or nought. Suerly M. Horn it semeth to me straunge that you being a man of the Churche, and knowinge that the Clergy hath vppon the great truste that good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue had of their vpprightnes and vertue, bene endewed with great possessions (which in dede should be and commonly haue bene imployed vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the nedy according to the mynd

of the doners) shuld fynd fault, with Mortmaine, and with that, which good and well disposed men haue voluntarily offered to the Church, to be well and charitably bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But I perceyue why ye are an enemy to Mortmaine. For nowe haue you and your Madge lyue catle of your owne, for the which you haue more care to prouide, then for any Mortmaine for your successours in the see.</p>
                  <p>But as I was about to tell yow, ye must vnderstande, that the statute of Mortmaine doth not reache to religious men onely,<note place="margin">The sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine doth not touch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouse me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only.</note> but to bisshops and other spirituall men, yea to lay men also: And was made aswell for the commodity of spiritualty as temporalty: to saue aswell to the one, as to thother theire wardes, eschetes, and other commodities that by mortifying of Lands, are wont to followe.

Thirdly, that you will graunte me for fiue yeres the tenth of al my realme, to relieue me for the great charges and expences, defraied in my warres against the Flemmings. These conditions the king required the Pope to assure him of by Othe. Then would M.

As for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uestitures let them goe for this time: we haue sayd inough, I suppose, of that matter. And as for deposing of a Bishope, he deposed him not but vnder pretence of heresy (saieth Nauclere) he depriued him of all his temporaltyes, and of his Bishopricke. But why doe ye not M. Horne recite the whole sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of your authors Antoninus and Nauclerus? For as for Blondus, writing nothing of this mater, that is of of the deposing of any Bishop, or of the claimi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of the inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitures, for the which you seeme to alleage him, ye doe but blindly allege, and may blot hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out again: sauing that ye may truly put in, that in the Councel which king Philip called in Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he appealed (as I haue told you) to th'Apostolik See of Rome. But why do ye not, as I sayd, shew the whole a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d entiere sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of your authours, fully to adorne your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy withal? whiche is, that he toke a certayne Bishoppe, laying to hys charge that he was a Patera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heretik, spoyling hym of his Bishopryke and of al his goods: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that he spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led also and robbed the Bishopprykes beinge vacante, and that he would haue had the inuestitures of the Bishoppes? Now if it were so, that king Philip deposed a Bishop for he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:18356:351"/>
yet shuld you M. Horne of al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take smallest reliefe therby. For yf Philip your supreme head were now lyuing,<note place="margin">M.

Horne calleth it) <hi>of matters Ecclesiastical,</hi> and that Paulus Aemilius should be his Authour therein, which is a double vntruth. For neither is it true, that Aegidius was any counsailer or aider to refourme the Churche, or rather defourme it, after the order of M. Hornes Relligion: nor Aemilius saith it. Againe, Sabellicus is eyther twise placed in M.

And therefore al were it true, that they wrote in the fauoure of Lewys the .4. then Emperour, yet were you neuer the nerer of your purpose by one iote. This is M.

He auouched moreouer that it appertained to the Emperour, to make or depose Popes. Furthermore being cited to answere in a cause of heresie, and being accursed for his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tumacy, he hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued almost these te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne yeres in the said curse. He retained al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, one Iohn of Landenio an Archeheretik. He ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth bisshops, he breaketh the interdict, and doth expel the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of their benefices that wil not breake it. He seuereth matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tracted in the face of the Church: and ioyneth persons to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the degrees forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. He meaneth perchaunce</hi> (sayeth Nauclere) <hi>that he maried his sonne Lewys to the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roles, her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Iohn, the king of Beames son, yet liuing: saying that he was impote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d furder, shee was maried to this Lewys being within the degrees prohibited. Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t addeth beside, that he hath set vp an Idole in the Churche, and an Antipope, and hath de facto, deposed the Pope.</hi> These are Nauclere, M.

And what answere so euer the French King made to Eugenius, touching the sayed Basile Councell, the Councell is no further allowed in the Catholike Church, then Eugenius and his successour Nicolaus did allowe the same. And (as ye shewe your selfe) themperour Friderike saieth, that by his office he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of God, to be <hi>the chiefe Aduocate of the Church.</hi> He saieth not, the chiefe head of the Church, the which ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour he did attribute, not to him selfe, but to the Pope only, of whome he was crowned, as his predecessours were. These also are but stale wares, and much woren. And for such I let them passe. As for the Frenche King and hys pragmatical sanction, which Charles his predecessour had made, and whiche he at the requeste of Pope Eugenius, would not reuoke: it contained no such matter, as you M. Horne doe attribute to princes nowe, neyther was that gouernement like to that which you nowe defend. This pragmaticall sanction stode most about monye matters: It denied to the Court of Rome, the great payements which went out of Fraunce, about Reseruations, collations, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendoes of bishoprickes, prebendes and benefices.

                  <p>As for the Generall Councell, that you saye Maximilian and Lewys the Frenche King, called at Pyse, it was neuer taken for anye Generall Councell, nor Councell at all, but a schismaticall assemblie procured against Pope Iulius by a fewe Cardinalles, whome he had depriued of their Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall honour. And it was called onely by the meanes of the Frenche King in despite of Pope Iulius, for making league with the Venetians, and for mouing Genua to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belle againste him.

                     </note> but seeinge the matter growe to a Schisme, he rased that Conuenticle, being remoued from Pise to Millaine, and agreed with Pope Iulius. By whom also, and by Leo the .10. his successoure, this Conuenticle was dissanulled in a Generall Councell holden at Laterane in Rome. To the whiche Councell at length, as wel the Schismaticall Cardinalles, as all other Princes, condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And thus euer, if there be any thing defectuouse or faulty, that you make much of, and that maketh for you: but if the faulte be refourmed, and thinges done orderlye, that you will none of, for that is against you.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:18356:383"/>
where in Sabellicus that should appere, his workes being so large, it semeth to be a manifest Vntruth. For neither in his Aenead. 11. lib. 2. where by the course of time it shoulde be found, neither in <hi>Rebus Venetis,</hi> nor anye otherwhere can I yet finde it.

                  <p>And yet if all were true, what proue you els, but that then the Pope was an euill man, and his Courte licentiously or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered? Whereof if you inferre, M.

Who is ignoraunte, that not one of these Reuerent Fathers did sincerely thinke that to be true, which you here impute vnto them? For whereas
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:18356:387"/>
all vpright iudgement shoulde come of a mans owne free choise, not stained or spotted either with the hope of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate lucre and honoure, or with the feare of great losse, the one of those two things which of all other, most forceably carieth men away, from professing their owne conscience, did stoppe those men from saying and vttering that, which otherwise they would most gladly haue vttered: sithens as they were put in hope of al promotion, if they agreed with the Kings will (of which they made, I iudge, the lesse ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compte) so disagreeing from the same, they were certaine to loose bothe goods and life, and also their good name, in the shew of the worlde, as who shoulde haue bene put to deathe by the name of Traitours, whiche is the thing that all true subiectes doe chieflie abhorre. Yet you knowe in suche sorte suffered a great many, notable both for lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and vertue, as D.

You knowe also, the matter, then was not so sifted and tryed by learning, as it hath bene since. And we know, they were the secrete snakes of your adders broode, that induced the King to that minde, not any of the Doctours here by you named, who all againste their willes, condescended therevnto.</p>
                  <p>Howe then are they broughte foorthe for witnesses of your heresies, who for feare of deathe saied as you doe, and that no longer then the foresaid impedimente laie in theyr waye? For when the state of the worlde was otherwise that without feare of deathe they might vtter their minde freely: who knoweth not, that all they who liued to see those daies of freedome, in all theire woordes and deedes, protested that the Pope, and not the King, was head of the

Hornes plea, but wil ioyne issue, and cope with him euen with our own lawe, and with his owne authour. And that M Horne shall not say I deale with him hardly and pinchingly, but freely and liberally: I do here offer to be tried, not by the Pope (for feare of a premunire) but by the Iudges of the kinges benche: and by al other the Quenes May. Iudges, yea by all the lawyers of the realme to, that by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon lawe of the realme in Braughtons time the king was not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the head of the Churche, but the Pope. And if M. Horne may proue the contrary to my assertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by Braugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, then dare I offerre in M.

Braughtons wordes? Do I misreherse them, sayeth May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Horne? And what will ye haue then more, will he saie? Forsoth Mayster Horne we loke for, but three litle wordes more, that is, that ye proue vs owt of Brawghton, that the kinge is the greatest in his realme, and the Vicar of all, not in matters cyuill, which we willinglye graunte you, but for matters ecclesiasticall.

And so haue you for all this ioly fetche, fetched in nothing to your purpose, but haue fished all this while in Braugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton all in vayne.

And then we haue some hope, that as you can proue nothing by him, for your new primacie: So shall we proue euen by your owne authour, that by the common lawe of the realme, the Pope was then the cheif head of all Christes Churche. And me thincke, thowghe in your texte there is nothing but the duskishe, darke, hornelight of an vnfaythfull and blinde allegation, that yet in your margent, there appereth a glistering day starre, and that the sonne is at hande to open and disclose to the worlde by the bright beames and most cleare light of the catholyque faythe, shyning in youre owne Authoure, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your exceding malice, or your most palpable grosse, and darke ignorance.

Horne blow out of his iolye Horne, a gloriouse and triumphant blaste, to signifie to all the world, what a renowned co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>queste he hath made vppon poore M. Fekenham. He setteth forth his army to the vewe of the worlde, wherby he sayeth he hath obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this famouse victorie: furnished with a number of most holie gouernours amongest Gods people, before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ, as Moyses, Iosue, Dauid, the king of Niniue, Darius, and Nabuchodonosor: furnished with the manifest scriptures of the newe testamente, and the examples of the most godly Emperours, with generall and nationall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles, with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall practise of the Churche, with the Popes sworne vassales, his chaplaines, his cardinalles, his chamberlaines, his secretaries, his librarie kepers, his peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiaries, his legates, his peterpence gatherers, his sworne monks and Abbattes, yea to confirme vp his proufes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, with the testimony of Doctour Gardiner, D. Tonstal, D. Bonner, and D. Thirlbie. And therfore he trusteth that M. Fekenham will nowe at length, yelde and recken hym self wel satisfied, and take the othe of the supremacy.</p>
                  <p>This is a Royall and a Triumphante conqueste in deede, Mayster Horne, if it be as you vaunte. But yet, I would muche soner beleue yt, yf I hearde any indifferent man besides your self, say as much. For thowghe, as I heare say, you coulde handle your clubbe, your buckler, and your waster wel and cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ningly, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye were in Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bridge, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ye wil not sticke as yt is reported, now and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to talke, when ye are disposed to bragge of your yowthly partes
<pb facs="tcp:18356:404"/>
there played, yet to say the truth, in this combate with M. Fekenham I see no such manlines in you. Neither haue ye plaied so closely, but that a man may easely reache you a rappe vppon the head, armes, or shoulders, and cause you there to cratche and claw with your fingers, where it yt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth not. Yea ye are beaten quite out of the field, with your owne proufes and weapons.</p>
                  <p>And as for M. Fekhenha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye haue not fastened vpon him as much as one blow. What speak I of a blowe? No not so much as a good phillip. And therfore wheras ye so brauely bragge, and so triumphau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlie vaunt, that all is yours, when in dede ye haue lost al, I thinke good to put you in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of the great wise man that Atheneus writeth of:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 12.</note> who as often as any ship came to the haue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, would runne thither with al haste, and welcome the mariners with great ioye and gratulation, reioycing exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinglie and thanking God that had sent home his Marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, so sauflie, and so prosperouslie. For the poore man (such was his wisedome) being owner of no part, thought al to be his. I say, it fareth euen so with you, M. Horne. Of al the good Emperours, Kings, Fathers and Councelles by you rehearsed, crie you as much and as long as ye will, that they are al yours, yet there is not so much as one, yours. Ye haue not brought so muche as one authority directly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluding your purpose. Els shew me, but one of al the foresaid Authors that saieth that the Pope hath no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie either in England or in other countries out of Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. Shew me one that saith either plain words, or in equi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ualent, that the Prince is Supreme head in al causes eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall. Yea shewe me one, that auoucheth the Prince to be the Supreme gouernour in any one cause mere ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical.

And thinke you now in the folding vp of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, to perswade your Readers, that yee haue them all on your side?

Now to persuade the conscience, requireth either a soden reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or miraculouse inspiration from God (which is not to be presumed without some euident signe thereof) or els a tract of time, to be instructed, informed and taught that which we neuer lerned before.

Me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be perswaded to take the othe, which is an externall fact, by external respects of force, feare, or fraylty: but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to declare the othe in his conscience, no man can be without an internall persuasion of hart and minde: Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

for his necessary instruction in the Christian faith. Neither did he lacke at home, of his owne subiectes that could well (as yt semeth) haue serued his turne.

It is then to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered, that anon after the death of Christe and so euer after vntil Lucius time, there were amonge the Christians, a number of heretikes, whiche as they bore the name of Christians, so by theyre heresies they loste the benefitte of their Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dome: as the Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians (the schollers of Simon Magus) Menandrians, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turninians, the Basilidians, the Nicolaites, the heretikes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Gnostici,</hi> for the excellent knowledge they pretended to haue aboue other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the Cherinthians, the Cerdonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the Phrygians, the Montanistes, and Marcionites with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse other.

wante of this good choyse of Instructours, was the cause why Valens the Emperour became an Arrian and suche an horrible bloudsucker of the catholikes.

Dowbtles the very same that he toke, that is, to send to the Churche of Rome, which neuer erred in faith, and which <hi>was the principal Churche, and with the which al other Churches muste agree, by reason of the cheif principalitie of that Churche,</hi> as Ireneus that blessed bishop and Martyr wrote, euen in the tyme of this Lucius?

And in case they had so great regarde to scripture onely, and measured and squared their lawes and doings by scripture, belike M.

Neither is it likely, but that before this time, there was some copie of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine lawes in Britain, the yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g Noble men of the Realme being much geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the Romain tong, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Agricola did prefer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before the Galles or French me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and being brought vp in Rome especially Coilus, king Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius father spe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding al his youth there: So that Lucius had no nede to send to Pope Eleutherius for Caesars lawes. And if he had nede, it is more likely he would haue sente to some other then to Eleutherius, who with other blessed Popes at that time, medled (God wot) litle with Caesars Ciuill la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, or with any other lawes of Pagan Princes. But of al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, Eleutherus answer is most vnlikely.

                  <p>This epistle then, be it true, or be it a counterfait doth as yet serue M. Horne to no great purpose: but for any thing we haue brought out of this Epistle, M. Horne perchance wil not him self greatly passe of it. There is an other priuie
<pb facs="tcp:18356:421"/>
treasure hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here, for the which, I suppose this Epistle is chiefly brought forth, and that is to proue eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Pope Eleutherius him self,<note place="margin">How and vvherein King Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius vvas Gods Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care.</note> that the King and not the Pope is the supreme heade in al causes Ecclesiasticall. For Eleutherius saith, that Lucius was <hi>Vicare of God in his Kingdome.</hi> This, this is the marke that M. Horne al this while hathe shot at: this is the cause, that this Epistle, that hath so many hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred yeares lyen dead, is now reuiued by M. Horne. Yea for this clause, this Epistle was solemply alleaged in open par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament against the Popes Primacie. And seeing that your new Diuinitie now, is nothing but English and Parliament Diuinitie: I will remitte you ones againe, M. Horne, to your owne Braughton, who vseth the same woordes. Which must nedes be (as by him appeareth) taken, that the King is Gods Vicare in his Kingdome, that is, in the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall administration of Ciuile, and not for Spirituall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And therfore, this Epistle doth as wel serue M.

This Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, be it a true or a false epi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stle, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for M. Horne nor for M.

Iewel to proue that the seruice must be in the English tongue: which is as true as that other where he saith, that Lucius <hi>sente to Rome to Eleutherius, for his aduice touching the ordering of his Church.</hi> Wherein if M. Iewell meane, that he sent to Rome before he was Christened, then haue ye one witnes more against you. But if he meaneth, as it semeth he doth, by his discourse of these letters that you specifie, parte wherof he also reciteth and among other things, that the King is Gods Vicare: then is he also deceiued. For in these letters king Lucius doth not aske his aduise in any Church matters, but requireth only to haue Caesars lawes sent him, appeareth by the tenour and purport of the said Epistle. So that I perceiue, this Epistle is an Instrument to set forth

for the terme of priestes, and wil nedes haue ministers placed for them. But how chaunceth yt M. Horne, that ye put not in also, for bishops, superintende<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts? Shal the inferiour clergy chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge their papistical name, and wil you reserue to your self stil the name of Bisshops, because it is more lorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke? It is a wonderful thing to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider the practise of these protestants: To make a way to their new diuinity, they first began to alter the vsual names, chaunging confession into knowledge, penance into repentance, Church into co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, Image into idole, with many such like. So to make a way, to induce men to belieue, that Order is no Sacrament, and that there is no sacrifice in the Church, they could not, nor ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> abide the name of priests.

It is spoken not of Bisshops and Priests alo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, which nowe in the Church are properly called Priests: but as we call al (the faithful) Christians, because of the mystical ointment, so we cal al the faithful Priests, because they are the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of one Priest, that is, Christe.

Horn, then your owne chapter and allegatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I reason thus. Christe contineweth a prieste accordinge to the order of Melchisedech for euer: the sacrifice of which order he she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed in his last Supper. <hi>Ergo</hi> there is and euer shall be that sacrifice of our true Meschisedech, which he offred in his laste Supper, whiche is the sacrifice of the masse in the Church. <hi>Ergo</hi> it is vntrue, that Christe hath no ministeriall priesthood or Sacrifice in the Churche.<note place="margin">

And for this cause is Christ called a prieste for euer, in the chapter by yowe rehersed, and in the psalmes. I bringe not, M.

Here perhaps M. Horn wil take some holde, and answere that M. Iewel hath answered suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently to Oecumenius in his Reply to M. D. Hardinge. What kinde of answere it is and howe substantiall, it will wel appere, when the Reioynder shal come to this Article touching the sacrifice. And yet I suppose men that be not to much and to sinistrally wedded to their owne fantasies, may see good cause, by such other answeres as are made to part of his reply, what to iudge of the whole.

For these being the chief matters or things Ecclesiasticall, as your selfe can not denie, and the Prince hauing nothing to doe with them, as you also confesse, it can not be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, that the Prince should haue the Supremacy in al cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses or things Ecclesiastical.<note place="margin">The Princes suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which kind of arguing is as wise as if a man woulde affirme, God to be the maker of al things, the geuer of all things, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruer of al things, and yet by and by to saye: God can not geue the effect of grace to externall Sacramentes, God can not preserue his owne blessed Mother from al actual or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal sinne.

                  <p>Yet one thing would I faine knowe more of you, M. Horne, if I may be so bolde, and learne, what you meane nowe at the length to come in <hi>with the supreme Authority and power of the sworde.</hi> What meane you, I say, to define

In all your booke hitherto, of such supreme Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and power of the sworde, you neuer spake worde. Howe chaunceth it then, the sworde commeth in nowe? Doth the supreme gouernement of the Churche of God consiste in the power of the sworde? Then howe was the Church of God gouerned .300. yeres and more before the time of Constantine the Emperour, who was the very first (as hath bene shewed) that by the power of the sworde, I saie, by the power of the sworde, guided, cared, prouided, directed and aided Gods Churche? Did the Churche of Christ want a Supreme gouernour all those .300. yeres and more? Againe, doe the Lawes of the Church take force by the power of the sword? You with M. Nowell, and with the Acte of Parliament, do take away from the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie the power and Authoritie to make Churche Lawes, and Constitutions: and you say and swere to, that no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation or Councel of Bishops, shal or may haue force or Authoritie to decree any Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stitution Ecclesiastical, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Princes consent, licence, and supreame authoritie.

Wherin how shamefully you haue misreported the whole practise of the Churche, I haue sufficiently shewed in the seconde and third Bookes. But in all your so long processe you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer yet openlie said, that by the power of the sword suche

Canons and Lawes tooke place. And come you nowe to saye, that all this proceded of the power of the sworde? Where is then nowe become the libertie of the Ghospell, that your graundsir Luther, and all your protestant proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors of Germany do in al their writings so much extolle, maintaine, and defende against the Secular swoorde of Ciuill Magistrates?

You see then the Church hath a greater power to punishe withall, then the princes sworde. And to proue vnto you euidently, that the Princes sworde can be no part of Ecclesiastical or Spiritual gouernement, I will wishe you to marke but this one reason. The Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches power, iurisdiction, and gouernement, extendeth to the soule, ouerseeth, guideth, and ruleth the soule of man, not the bodie or any thing appertaining to the bodie. But the Princes swoorde can not reache to the soule of man. Ergo the Princes sworde can not be any fitte meane to gouerne as the Churche doothe, or to beare the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme gouernment in Church matters. The Maior or first Proposition is clere and confessed not onely of al Diuines, but of all Christian men that know what the Churche and the soule meaneth. The Minor is also cleare, if by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Math.</hi> 10. <hi>c.</hi> 28</note> then to teache, that the Prince his sword whyche can not hurte the soule, shoulde be the supreame Gouernoure of the Churche, all whose power is ouer the soule? Whereof I reason thus. The Prince can not punnishe the soule of man: Ergo he hathe no iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ouer it. Item he can not relieue it, or release it,

To this M. Horn answereth: first that this place of S. Paul must be vnderstanded of teaching, preaching, and disputing: and that therfore it wil not follow thereof, that they may not take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any gouernment in Ecclesiastical causes. And then being merily disposed, he saith this Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is much like, as if a yong Nouice shuld reason thus. Nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes must kepe sile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the Cloisture: therfore the Prioresses haue not the gouernment in Nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nish causes and matters. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the first part of his answere, I say that the argument is good a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For if teaching, preaching, and disputing in matters of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, be causes and matters ecclesiastical: and if wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be imbarred fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this, then is there a sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cause, why M. Fekenham may not take this othe, that a woman is supreme head in al causes spiritual a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ecclesiastical: Namely to erect and enact a new and proper religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> throughout her realme by the vertue of her own proper and supreme gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For to this end, M. Horn, is the othe te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ed. It is to euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. It can not be dissembled. Againe, the said place of S. Paul is of the order and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of scripture, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the text. If then S. Paul forbiddeth a woman to expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d scripture: how can a woman take vpon her, to be the chief iudge of al those that expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the scripture? I mean in that very office of expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding Scripture, in decreei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining, and enacting, what religion, what beliefe, what doctrine shal take place. And such shee must nedes be, if she
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:18356:439"/>
be a supreme head. Suche do you and your fellowes make her. Such authority you M. Horn, throughout all this boke, attribute to your new supreme heads, Emperours and Ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs by you alleaged. You make them to preache, to teache, and to prescribe to the Bishops in their Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels, what and how they shal do in their ecclesiasticall matters. If then by you a supreme Gouerner in ecclesiastical maters, must be so qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, as to be present in Councels of Bishops, to prescribe rules for the Bishops to follow, to determine what they shal do, and to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme by royal asse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the decrees of bishops, yea and to make them selues, decrees and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stitutions ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical, but a woman by S. Paule, may not ones speake in the Church, that is, in the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or assembly of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and by you a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may not preache, teach, or dispute: vndoubtedly both by S. Paul, and by your own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession, a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can not be a supreme Gouernour, such as the Othe forceth me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to swere. I say, supreme gouernour in al eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical causes. No nor in so many causes by a great deale, as you pretend in this your booke, other Kings and Princes to haue practised supreme gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider now, M. Horne, how it may sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with S. Paules doctrine, that a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may be a supreme gouerner in al ecclesiastical causes: namely such as you in this boke, would make your Reader beleue, that al Emperours, Kings and Princes hitherto haue bene. Now put the case (as we saw it viij. yeres past) that in a doubtful matter of doctrine and religion to be tried by scripture, the whole number of bishops agree vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate and resolute exposition with their Clergie, and would by an Ecclesiastical law of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uocation or Councel set forth the same? Al their resolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and determination is not worth a rush by your Othe and by your maner of talke
<pb facs="tcp:18356:440"/>
in this booke, if the Prince doe not allowe and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme the same. And how this wil sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with S.

And now are ye come to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s point, and driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therto by the force of this place, to say: that the place doth not proue, but a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may haue some gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in ecclesiastical causes: As though the Questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were now of some gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not of Supreme and absolute Gouernment in al ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thinges and causes ecclesiastical. If therefore this place do proue, that a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath not the Supreme and absolute gouernement in all causes ecclesiasticall, but that in some, and them the chiefest, she must holde her peace, as yt doth euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, and ye can not denie yt: then is M. Fekenham free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taking the othe of the supremacy, and then hath S. Paule vtterly confuted that Othe, and your whole booke withal.</p>
                  <p>This I say also, as by the way, that yf this chapter must be taken, for teaching, preaching and disputing, as M. Horne saith and truely, that M. Iewell went far wide fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> S. Paules meaning, when he applied yt to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon seruice of the Church, whereof it is no more mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> talke in tauernes. As for M.

And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he may as long, and as iolily as he wil, triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ph with him self in his own folly. Yet I would wish M. Horne to speake wel of Nunnes, were it but for his grandsir Luthers sake, and the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly coniunctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of him and a Nonne together: Which vnhappy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunction of that Vulca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Venus, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred the vnhappy brood of M.

I say nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g here of many other articles that ye are aswel bound to belieue as these. As that Christe is consubstantial to the Father, that he hath two natures, and two willes, and that the holy Ghost procedeth from the Father and the sonne, with such like. The opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of many learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is, M. Horne, that there be fowrtene articles of the faith, wherin aswel the diuines as the canonistes do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agree. And to omitte other cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries, the bishops of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in their sinodes haue determined a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> order by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stitutions prouincial, that aswel the articles of the faith accordi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to this nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, as the .10. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts should be quarterly expounded, and declared to the people by theire curates in the vulgar tong. Truth yt is, that they are commonly called the .12. articles of the faith, not because they are precisely but xij. But because yt is thowght that the Apostles before they were dispersed abrode in the worlde to preache, made eche one a parcel of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon crede. And for that cause, they are vsually called the .12. ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.

Or for that they be reducible to .12. principal articles, to the which some do reduce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or to .14. as they are vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reduced in the Schooles. In this sort the Article of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of Saints, may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended in the Article of the holy Catholike Church.

                  <p>You answer. <hi>The Othe maketh no me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion in any one word of the Catholike Church.</hi> But I replie: In that you exclude al foraine power and authoritie, you exclude also the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik Church, which is no lesse forain to you, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the Pope, to whom that Church is subiect, as the body to the head.</p>
                  <p>You saye, the Othe <hi>speaketh of a foraine Prince, Prelate, and Potentate, and so of the foraine power and authority of such a foraine state,</hi> but I replie: First that you belye the Othe.

                  <p>Hereof ariseth this proposition, as M. Fekenham by a si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude setteth it forth, and M. Horn alloweth it. fol. 100. b.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All Englishmen being Christians ought to admitte, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue, professe, and obey the Authority of the Catholike Church, that is, of the bishops of all Christendome (of whome the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part are forayne prelats to our Realme) in matters of faith and doctrine touching the same.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The contrary hereof is.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>No Englishmen though Christians, may admitte, professe or obey any Authority of any forain prelat without the Realme of England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The tenour of one parte of the Othe, as M. Horne reporteth it: pag. 99. b.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All true subiectes ought and muste renounce and forsake all forraine iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdictions, povvers, superiority, preeminences and Authorities of euery forayn prince and prelat, state or potentat.</hi>

                  <p>I say nowe M. Horne: yf by vertue of this othe euerye true subiect must renounce euery foraine prelate: then did S.

Last of all, then was he farre wyde to pronounce them for me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cleane out of the Catholike Churche, which seuered them selues from the society of any part thereof. Then also might the Donatist (had he learned so far furth his lesson as you haue) both easied him self of much trauell out of Afrike into Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Fraunce, and also might sone haue stopped S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines mouth, saying: What haue we to doe with forain prelates beyond the seas, what nede we care for their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, iurisdiction, society, and communion? We are true subiectes of Afrik. We renounce al foraine power, Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Authoritye.</p>
                  <p>And truely I see no cause, but with as good reason and conscience, al subiects of all realmes may and ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce by othe the power and Authoritie of al forain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats or bishops out of their land and Countre, as we of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d must a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ought so to do out of ours.

In the towne of Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werpe your brethren the Sacramentaries of Geneua had theire churches fairly built. The Lutherans also had theire churches. This was euident to the eye. Our owne countre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men the marchants ther can beare me witnesse. Is this an agreement M.

<pb facs="tcp:18356:453"/>
(of Martin Luther so called) the other must be called the Caluinists Church, of Caluin of Geneua? But forth. It came to the point in Antwerpe, that the Caluinistes tooke armes against their Prince, the .xiij. of Marche last being thursday. A worthy monyment of their holy profession. For wil you knowe the cause why? Forsoth because the same daye in the forenoone, certain of their brethern to the number of 200. and vpward were slayne in the fielde beside a number drowned in the ryuer, and taken aliue, nigh to Antwerpe by a power of the Lady Regent, which said brethern with a great number more had made a profession (which also for certain dayes they had put in practise) to range aboute the Countrie, and to ease al Churches and Churchmen of their goods, mary yet of conscience, not iniuring any laye man. The quicke iustice done vpon such open robbers and theues, the holy brethern of your sect not abyding, forese<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that yf such pageants were longe played, their partes were like to followe, moued them immediatly as I said to take armes against their Prince in Antwerpe, to require the kays of the gates, the Churches of the Catholikes to be disposed at their pleasure, the expulsion of al religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and priests &amp;c. All which things were graunted vnto them by the gouernor of the town, vpon a dayes delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that al thinges might be done quietly: And they thus for the space of .ij. nightes and one day ruled al the roste in Antwerpe. What outrages in that small season they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, namely vpon the poore grey friers, whose knowen vertues irked them most aboue al other orders, I let passe. The Saterday being the .x. of Marche in the morning, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your brethern the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taries M.

Horne to their great greefe the very Martinistes or Lutherans (betwene whom and you, you pretend allwaies such agreement) in Armes also against them. And that morning lo M. Horne was the last ioyful houre that your Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tary brethern sawe in that towne. For immediatly finding themselues to weake, they were faine to yeld vp the attillery which vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the soden two dayes before they had seasoned vpon, and in stede of their beggarly and trayterous crie of which all Antwerpe before did ring, in stede I say of <hi>Viue le Geus,</hi> to crye, full sore against their hartes: <hi>Viue le Roy.</hi> God saue the kinge. From that day forewarde your brethern went backewarde. Vale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cene the first and chief rebelling towne wythin ix. dayes after was taken. The preachers within xiiij. dayes after that, bothe Sacramentary and Lutheran haue voyded the towne, yea the whole countre. God be praised. But this I tell you M. Horne, that you may note, howe the Lutheranes them selues stode in Armes against the Caluinistes: Protestants against Protestants, yea in the quarell of protestanticall prowes.</p>

And for mine owne parte (being further touched herein, then I haue yet expressed) my very trust and hope is, that the charity of this our newe refourmed Churche here in this realme, shal not be found so colde and shorte, as in proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding so sharpe lawes and paines of death to force men to take this othe, of the Quenes Highnes Supreamacie, but

                  <p>For a resolute ansvvere to all the saide Scruples, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the forenamed poinctes, his L. sayde, that he did muche lamente, that the right meaninge of the Othe; had not beene in season opened and declared vnto me,
<pb facs="tcp:18356:458"/>
whan the onely lacke of the right vnderstanding thereof, hath bene the cause of such staies and distourbance of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. Whereas the Q. Maiesties meaning in that Othe, is farre otherwise, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the expresse words are, as they lie <hi>verbatim,</hi> like as it doth well appeare by her Highnes interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made thereof in the Iniunctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Therevnto my obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was, that vndoutedly her Highnes did fully meane and mind to claim and take al spiritual gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her: for besides the expres wordes of the Othe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be bound to swere <hi>verbatim</hi> as they lie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out al chaunge and alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> making of any word or sense thereof, her Highnes (in the interpretation set foorth in her Iniu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s) doth by very playn words, claime the same spiritual gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t here in this realme of the Church of England, that her highnes father Kinge Henry, and her brother king Edwarde did enioye and claime before her: in the which iniunctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and in the late acte of Parleame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t also her highnes doth claime no more spiritual gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t nor no lesse, but so much in euery point, as they had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all exception. For answere his L. did still continue in the deniall thereof, and that her Highnes meaning was not to take so much of Spiritual authority and power vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon her, as they did: with affirmation, that he did moste certainly and assuredly know her highnes minde therein. Then for some issue to be had of this matter, seeing that the meaning of the Othe, is not as the expresse words doe
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:18356:458"/>
purport: And seing that his L. did so well vnderstand her Highnes meaning therein, and thereby the very righte sence therof, I besought him, that his L. would take some paines for truthes sake to penne the same: wherevpon his L. did penne and write the interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the said Othe as hereafter followeth. I.A.B. do vtterly testifie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, that the Q. Highnes is the only Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme gouernor of this Realm, and of al other her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and countries, as wel in al spiritual or ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>astical things or causes, as te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral. That is, to haue the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraingtie and rule ouer al manner persons, borne within her Realmes, dominions and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries, of what estate ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ecclesiastical or te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral so euer they be. And to haue authority and power to visit the Ecclesiastical estate, and persons, to refourme, order, and correct the same: and all maner errours, heresies, schismes, abuses, offenses, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptes, and enormities. Yet neuertheles in no wise meaning, that the Kings and Queenes of this Realme, possessours of this crowne, may challenge authoritie or power of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie of diuine offices, as to preache the worde of God, to minister Sacramentes or rytes of the Churche appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Christe to the office of Churche ministers, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, or to binde, or loose. Of the whiche fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer pointes, three belong onely to the Ecclesiastical mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, the fourthe is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to them with the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, namely to exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate. And that no forain Prince,

Person, Prelat, State or Pote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tate, hath or ought to haue any iurisdiction, Power, Superioritie, preheminence, or authority ecclesiastical or Spiritual, within this realme. And therefore I doe vtterly renounce al foraine iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, powers, superiorities, preheminences, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities: That is, as no Secular or Laie Prince, other than the King or Quenes possessours of the Croune of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme, of what Title or dignitie so euer they be, hathe or oughte to haue, anye Authoritie, soueraigntie, or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ouer this Realme, ouer the Prince or Subiectes thereof.

                  <p>THIS processe following standeth vppon certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions of M. Hornes, as M. Feke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> saieth. But M. Horne denieth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And therefore being <hi>quaestio facti</hi> as they cal yt, and the doubte restinge vpon priuate talke, that passed betwene them: I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> geue no certaine iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: but must referre yt, to the discrete consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t reader. Yet so muche as I know, I wil say, and that is, that I vnderstande by suche as haue had at seueral times co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the sayde M. Fekenha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and emong other thinges, of this conference, heard M. Fekenha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> say, that tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching theis resolutions, he hath the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of M. Daniel, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to M. Horne, his hand writing, redie to be shewed at all tymes. If yt be so, yt is likely, that M. Daniel can and wil
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:18356:460"/>
testifie the truth, in case he shoulde be required: of whose hand writing M Fekenha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> saieth he hath also certaine other thinges copied out. But yet because, the euent of things to come are vncertaine, let vs imagine an vnlikely case, that is, that M. Daniel wil deny these forsaied writings to be of his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: and that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> M. Horne will much more sharply and veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly crie out against these resolutions, then he doth now, that they are none of his, <hi>but lyke to him that forged them, false, feyned and maliciouse,</hi> with much other like mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he laieth forth for his defence nowe. Suerly then though M. Fekenham were lyke to haue therbye no great preiudice in the principal matter, (for whether these reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions be true or false, the principal point is neither great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bettered, nor much hindred by them) yet should M. Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perchaunce greatly impayre his honesty and good name therby. Let vs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as I said, thinck vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the worst, and whether that M. Fekenham as he hath, (as ye haue heard,) much good defence for the principall pointe, so he may in this distresse, fynde any good reliefe, for the defending and sauing vpright of his honesty. Ye wil perchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der now thinck, that M. Fekenha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is in a very hard a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d strayt case: and that yt were a great difficulty to find any appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or honest help for him. And yet for al this ther is good and great helpe at ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de. For I wil be so bolde my self for ones, to take vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my self to make a sufficient proufe, that these resolutions are not M. Fekenhams, but M. Hornes owne. And yf his secretary will not serue, I wil bring forth one other witnes that shalbe somwhat nerer him, and that M. Horne can not, nor shall, for all the shiftes that euer he shall make, refuse: and that is Mayster Horne him selfe, and no worse man. For thoughe I be not very priuie and
<pb facs="tcp:18356:461"/>
certaine what passed betwixt M. Horne and M. Feke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ham at Waltham: yet of the contentes of this his printed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to M Fekenham I am assured, and so consequentlie that these are his resolutions, confessed more then ones or twise, by his owne mowthe and penne.</p>
                  <p>Consider therfore good reader, the state of the question touching theis resolutions. Is yt any other, then that as M. Fekenham auowcheth, M. Horne tolde him, for a resolute answere, <hi>that the Quenes Mai. meaning in the othe is farre otherwise, then the expresse wordes are in the statute, as they lie verbatim? And that thinges are therefore with some gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle vnderstanding to be interpreted, and mollified? And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that thoughe the wordes of the statute be general and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, that she onely is the supreame gouernour of the realme aswell in all spiritual or ecclesiasticall thinges or causes, as tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall: Yet in no wise the meaning is that the kinges or Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes may challe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge authority or power of ministerie of diuine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, as to preache the worde of God, to minister Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, to excommunicate, to bynde or lose?</hi> To this effect come M. Hornes resolutions in the interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Othe, made by him at M. Feckenhams request as M. Fekenham saieth. But M. Horne doth flatly denie, that euer he made anie suche moderation or mollification, and laieth forth manie reasons to perswade the Reader, that M. Fekenham hath slaundered him. He saieth <hi>the right sense of the othe, is none other then yt is plainely set forth.</hi> he saith: <hi>that the supremacie is onely in the Quenes highnes: for this exclusiue (onely) ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not haue any other sense, or meaning.</hi> He saith moreouer, <hi>when I adde this supreamacie to be in all spiritual causes or thinges, I shewe an vniuersal comprehension to be meante withowt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, for yf ye excepte or take away any thinge, yt is not all.</hi>
                     <pb n="441" facs="tcp:18356:461"/>
Are not theis your owne words M. Horne? do not then so generall and peremptory wordes of the statute, especially your precise exposition adioyned thervnto, expresly geue vnto the Quenes Mai. not only a simple and parted autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but the cheifest, the principaleste, and a general or vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersal authority in al thinges and causes whatsoeuer, as to preach, to minister the sacraments, and to lose and bynde, aswell as in other matters? Is it not euident, that theis are things spiritual and ecclesiastical? Do ye not attribute <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception,</hi> as we haue declared, by your owne words the supremacy to the Quene in al causes and thinges spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall? How then can it be possible, but that by a necessary consequent, ye doe also attribute, to her the supremacy in the causes Ecclesiastical before rehersed? And think yowe then M. Horne, that M. Fekenha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and his fellowes may take the othe with sauf conscience? And think you, that though the pope had no authority in the realme, the Quenes Mai. might haue so large and ample authority, the holy scripture being so playn to the contrary? Is it not likely therfore, that in your conference with M. Fekenham, ye did forsee this mischief, and therfor (though ye deny it here so stifly) that ye gaue him in dede such resolutions as be here specified? Suerly it is a thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g most probable. For ye make the very same resolutions to hym euen in this your answere also. For doe ye not expressely say a fewe leaues before,<note place="margin">

Fekenham saith he receyued at your handes? Again M. Fenkenham addeth, that in your said resolutions, ye saye that the authority to excommunicate is not properly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning to Princes, but apperteyneth to the whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation aswell as to them.<note place="margin">

Why say you then, that these resolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are feyned by M. Fekenham? Why should any man thinke that M. Feke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Why should not men thinke also such other things as ye here charge M. Fekenham withall to be vntrue, seing that ye doe so falsly accuse M.

Which is nowe so notoriouse, that there is a qualification made in the Quenes Maie. iniunctions, that men should not take the general clause so largely, as to collect thereby, that the Kings or Quenes of our realm may challe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge authority a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d power of ministerie in the diuine offices in the Church.

If any Catholik (good reader) should haue brought a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny out of this Author against M. Horne, yt should haue ben with great contempte refused and reiected by and by.

Yet M. Horne thinketh so to bewytche his reader, as yt were with certayne magical incantations, that he shoulde beleue this Anthony to be of his opinion.

Horne your commission, to excommunicate, that you haue receiued from the Church or congregation. Commission ye haue none from the Quenes highnes: (for as you say, she hath no such power her self) from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation you haue none: (from the which two you deriue all cohibityue iurisdiction) and from the Pope, ye neither haue, nor wil haue any. From whence fetche ye then your cohibityue iurisdiction to excommunicate? Now as I sayd take ye hede, leaste to your greate folly be annexed also a daungerouse premunire.</p>
                  <p>As for M.

The catholiks say, that this iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cometh not originally from the prince, but being in the Church, when fewe or no princes were christened: the princes when they first receiued the fayth, finding this iurisdiction in the Church, so lefte yt, and did rather encrease and amplify it, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in any part diminish the same. The statute sayth, that the prince is supreame head in al causes ecclesiastical: by the statute also all iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical is vnited and annexed to the crowne of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alm.

                     </note> M. Horne, to bring foorth but one such example. I neuer read, I neuer heard of any suche commission. Onely in the late daies of king Edward the sixt his time, I finde such commissions, by the whiche al Archbishops, Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and other Ecclesiastical persons did then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise all their Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction. There I finde, though vntruely, that all iurisdiction as well Secular as Spirituall, sprang from the King as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme head of all men. By the said commission a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things the Bishops tooke their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, not only to heare Ecelesiastical causes iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, but euen to geue holye orders also: as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the tenour of the same. They receiued also by vertue of the commission all manner of power Ecclesiastical: and al this no longer then during the Kings pleasure. And therefore within three mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths afterward, all Bishops and Archbishops were inhibited to exercise any Ecclesiasticall iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vntil the visitation, appointed by the king were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. There was also an other inhibition made, that no Bishoppe nor anye other Ecclesiasticall person should preache any sermon, vntil such time as they were specially thereto licensed by the king. And haue you not read or heard, M. Horne, that in the second yeare of king Edwarde the .6. letters were sent from the L. Protectour to the Bishop of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester, D. Gardiner, <hi>commaunding him in the kings behalfe, and charging him by the authority of the same, to absteine in his sermon from treating of any matter in controuersy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Aulter,

<pb facs="tcp:18356:474"/>

                  <p>Thus haue you taken awaye the very Scripturely visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Reformation, and Correction, (as you call it) from the Bishoppes and from theyr commission geuen to them by the woorde of God, and haue made it to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende vppon a further commission of the Queenes Hygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes pleasure: For that by letters patentes shee maye and hath inhibited for a season the Bishoppes of her realme to preache the worde of God, as her brother kinge Edwarde before did. And this you call M.

And hereof it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, that religion in our countrie shal neuer be setled, or of long continuaunce, excepte Princes alwaies of one minde and Iudgement doe Raygne. Hereof it followeth, that we shall neuer ioyne in Faithe and Doctrine with other christened Realmes and with the whole vniuersal Church except our happe be, to haue a prince so affected, as other Christen princes are. Hereof it followeth, that though our Prince be Catholike, yet thys Authorytie standinge, our Faythe is not Authorysed by Gods worde and the church, but by Gods woorde and the Prince, that ys, by Gods woorde so expounded and preached, as the prince shall commaunde and prescribe it.</p>

                     <pb n="454" facs="tcp:18356:474"/>Briefely hereof foloweth, that the faith of England is no faith at al builded vpon the authority of God and his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, who haue charge of our soules, but is an obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a temporal law, and an opinion chaungeable and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable according to the lawes of the Realme.</p>
                  <p>These are in dede moste horrible absurdities, and moste dyrecte againste the vnitie of the Churche, whiche aboue all thinges ought to be tendred, and without the whiche there is no saluation. This destroyeth the obedience of faithe, and setteth vp onely a philosophicall perswasion of matters of Religion. This cleane defaceth all true Religion, and induceth in place therof a ciuil policie. To co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, this maketh a plaine and directe waye to al heresies. For if euer (which God forbidde) any Prince of our land should be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to any heresie, as of Arrianisme, or any such like, the supreme Authority of the prince remaining as the Othe graunteth, and as king Edward practised, should not al the Bishops either be forced to preache that heresy, or to leese their bishopriks, other placed in their romes which to please the Prince, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to climbe to hònor, would be quick enough to farder the procedings? Any man of mean co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideration may see these inconueniences, and many moe then these, which of purpose I leaue to speake of. To returne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to you, M.

Ye may thinke vpon this at your good leasure. Remember also how you wil stand to this your saying: <hi>that the expresse woordes of the Statute doe not geue to the Prince all maner of iurisdictions.</hi> The Acte saith so expresselie in these wordes. <hi>And that your Highnes, &amp;c. shall haue ful po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and authoritie by vertue of this Act, &amp;c. to assigne, name, and authorise, when and as often as, &amp;c.

Dare you then to restraine the Act of Parliament, to the only second kind of Cohibitiue Iurisdiction, a kinde of Iurisdiction by your selfe inuented? But marke howe you haue confounded your selfe.

Forsoth say you, <hi>In that part where the Act afterward geueth power to the Prince to execute the Iurisdiction, NOW VNITED and annexed to the CROWNE, by mete delegates to be assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, &amp;c.</hi> Marke wel what you haue said. You auouch the same iurisdiction which is by the Prince to be assigned, and authorised in all maner, &amp;c. as before you haue heard, the same so Generall and vniuersall Iurisdiction, I saye, you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouche to be <hi>vnited and annexed to the Crowne.</hi> If that, so generall Iurisdiction (as hath ben saied) be vnited vnto the Crowne, whie denie you, <hi>that the expresse words of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute doe geue to the Prince all maner of Iurisdictions.</hi> Are you not contrary to your selfe? The Prince hath power to execute all maner Iurisdiction by meete delegates by him assigned by your owne confession, and the plaine woordes of the Act. The same Iurisdiction so by the Prince to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, is vnited to the Crowne, you say: Ergo all maner of Iurisdictions are vnited to the Crowne: you saye. It is vnited to the Crowne: Ergo it is geuen to the Prince. Thus by your owne wordes you are confounded, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vntruely and wrongfully to reproue M Fekenham for missereporting the Othe in that thing, which bothe the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Othe hath, and your own confession agniseth.
<pb facs="tcp:18356:476"/>
You thinke this general gifte may be auoyded by the limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that you say, is added. But you report the Othe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly. That limitation is not added to these general wordes: For it goeth before these general words in a former bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che of this Statute. And your selfe confesse, that these general wordes are sette after the gifte or restitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of spiritual Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction made to the Prince, in the which that limitation as you say, is fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de. And how ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I pray you, that which we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t before, be a limitation of that which came after? Who seeth not your extreme foly herein, and the miserable shifts that you are driuen vnto?</p>
                  <p>Now, you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessing the same general and vniuersall Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of which by vertue of th'Acte, the Prince hath the assigning a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d authorising, to be vnited to the crown, which is to be in the Prince, and reprouing M. Feckenham for so saying, doe find fault also with his reason, why he should so say, and do cal his reason or argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <hi>a foul sophisticatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> His reason, as your self reporteth it, is this. Princes haue not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues al maner of ecclesiasticall Iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: ergo they can not geue and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit the same to others. That they haue not al maner of Iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s your self denieth: for they haue saie you only the forinsecal and Courtly Iurisdiction, or as you call it the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cohibitiue Iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and not any spiritual Iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> touching the secret Courte of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science. Thus the Antecede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t you graunt, being forced therto by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures by M. Feckenha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alleaged. Why deny you then the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequent? You pretend for your denial, a limitation to be made in the Acte, of those generall wordes, <hi>al maner, in any wise,</hi> and <hi>any spiritual Iurisdiction:</hi> but that is now found to be but a fable, by reason that this limitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> goeth before in an other braunche of the Acte, and these generall wordes
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:18356:476"/>
do folow afterward, as your self also confesse. But to make a limitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, before the thing to be limited is spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of, is agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st al order and course of writing, or reason. Yet your vrge this to your Reader, againe and again: saying: <hi>that the matter or obiect wherin or wherabout these spiritual Iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> (to be by the Prince assigned) <hi>are exercised, is limited a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d added in these expresse wordes (for the visitation &amp;c.</hi>) which wordes are not added to the general gifte of assigning and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing all maner &amp;c. For they goe before that generall gifte, neither do or ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they limit that generality going (as I haue oft said) before it. I desire the Reader for better trial hereof to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider and peruse the Act it self. Thus the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this limitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that you prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d being but a mere forged and fained matter, the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of M.

Suche a prince called a Councell: or inuestured Bishoppes, or deposed Bishoppes, or made constitutions ecclesiasticall: ergo such and suche a prince were the supreme Gouernours in al ecclesiastical causes: I say not, you haue proued they did so, absolutely by their own Pri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cely authority: You haue missed in al your

proufes as well appereth to any indifferent Reader and peruser of bothe our writinges: But I saie, in case you had proued your Antecede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts good, was not this allwaies your Consequent? I say vpon one or diuers particulars to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude affirmatiuely an vniuersal?

Vpon this imagined Conclusion of M. Feckenhams you induce a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma, that whether the Conclusion folow or not folow, yet he shal alwaies remayne in some absurdite.

                  <p>For, Commission of Spiritual gouernement being geuen (as he reasoneth, and you expresly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse) to Bishops im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly from God, by Christ him selfe true God, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in some, but euen in the principall spirituall causes, as to
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:18356:477"/>
fede the Church with true doctrine, to preache the worde, to bind and loose, to minister the Sacraments, it foloweth euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, that the Prince is not the Supreme Gouernour in al Spiritual causes: And that the Acte hath wrongfully ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Prince the ful authorising <hi>for al maner of spiritual causes in any wise concerning any Spirituall or Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction to be vsed and exercised by persons, when and as often, and for such and so long time, as it shal please the Prince to authorise them:</hi> It foloweth, I saye, that the Acte hath wrongfully geuen al this to the Princes authorising, seeing that God him selfe hath already geauen it to the Apostles and their successours, Bishops and Priestes in his Churche, without any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission or authorisatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for any prince of the earth whatsoeuer. <hi>God hath</hi> (your self say, M. Horn) <hi>geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Bisshops sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission for the discharge of their cures: It were therfore</hi> (you say) <hi>an horrible absurdity, if they might not exercise any iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, without a furder co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Quenes highnes.</hi> But bothe by the practise in king Edwardes daies (at what time by the Kings letters pate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, bishops had a special co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to minister the Sacraments, and to preach the word, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Prince, and at the Princes pleasure, as it hath before ben declared) a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d also by the plaine Act in the Quenes M. daies now reigning, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops can not exercise, vse, or execute any Spiritual iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, without the Authorising, naming, and assigning of the Prince, yea and that no oftener, nor no longer, then it shall please the Prince to Authorise them (so that beeing a Bishoppe to daye, to morowe (by the Acte) he shall be none, if it please the Prince to dissauthorise him, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge him) <hi>Ergo,</hi> by Maister Hornes own confession and plaine constante assertion, bothe in King Edwardes dayes
<pb facs="tcp:18356:478"/>
and now in the Acte, <hi>an horrible absurdity,</hi> is committed. You haue saied M. Horne a great deale more against the Acte, then euer M. Feckenham saied. Beare therefore with him and vs I pray you, yf to auoide such <hi>an horrible absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,</hi> bothe he and we refuse the Othe of this acte. Some reason, I perceiue, M. Sampson and D. Humfrey of Oxford had, when they refused this othe, being tendred vnto them by a Commission. They saw it was in dede a most horrible absurdity, so to weake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods authority, that it must yet not of congruite, but of necessite and by force of lawe be bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered as of it selfe insufficient, with the Princes authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and letters patents. The sawe it was a great impiety, that bishops and Pastours by Gods lawe ordayned to suche offices, should not oftener exercise their offices, nor no len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger remaine in the saied offices, then it should please the Prince for the time to Authorise them and allowe them. Therefore these men them selues, no doubte true subiectes to the Quenes highnes, and well willers to her Maiest. Person, refused yet this Othe, as is aboue saied.</p>
                  <p>But what a conclusion is this M. Horne, how fowle an absurdity is it, to take the Othe of supreme gouernemente in al spiritual thinges or causes, in which Othe also you say, <hi>nothing may be excepted</hi>:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Fol.</hi> 104.</note> 
                     <hi>for if you except any, it is not al</hi> (these are your owne wordes) and yet to make nowe a limitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and to except so many and so principall causes ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, in the which (as you say also) the Prince hath no go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement at all, but only the Bishops, as hauing sufficient commission herein from God him selfe? Whereas if there were in dede any limitation by the Acte expressed or inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, (as there is not in dede any at all in the Authorising of mete persons to execute all maner of spirituall Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions)
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:18356:478"/>
it were yet open and manifest periury to sweare to a supreme gouernement in all causes without exception. What yf you, and your felowes intende not, or meane not al maner spirituall causes? Can this excuse them which sweare to all, from manifest periury? How many haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued the Othe, which neuer vnderstode worde of any suche limitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? If you meane in dede a limitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> M. Horne, procure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the limitation be put to the Othe expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that men may sweare to no more then is intended. Els if you intangle mens soules in open periury, vnder a couert limitation, assure your selfe, you and al other the procurers hereof shal answer full derely to God for all the soules that hereby haue perished. And assure your self, that,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Malach.</hi> 5</note> as the holy ghost infallibly threatneth, <hi>he wil come as a quicke witnesse against al periured and forsworen persons.</hi> Neither yet doth the limitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, excuse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> periury, which sweare Princes to be supreme gouernors in some spirituall causes, who are in dede no gouernours at al in such causes, nor euer had by the lawe of God, any spiritual charge or Iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto them. But yet if this limitation were annexed, the periury were the lesse, and the dealing were more playne, though not therfore good. In the meane while you which force men to sweare to al ecclesiastical causes, and yet will except so many ecclesiastical causes, how vnreasonably a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d how absurdely do you write? But of these your contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory assertions I haue before spoken.</p>
                  <p>If I should here aske M.

<pb facs="tcp:18356:479"/>
it would trouble him or any wise man els to geue any good reason therefore, the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of a Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Catholike Church (which al Christians in their Crede doe professe) presupposed. If I should farder aske M.

                  <p>Last of al take you yourself in dede M. Horn for a bishop? If so, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may you preache the word, minister the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, bind a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d lose, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you by God in holy scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, without any furder co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the prince. If you may so do, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> put the case, the Q.

But this shal you neuer be able to do while you liue, sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to that, which in this your booke you haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessed.

And therfore Dionysius Areopagita, Gregory Nazianzene and others say, that the Church of Christ, sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth as it were in the midle betwene the state of the sinagog of the Iewes, and the state that shal be in heauen: whervppon it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that as those thinges, that be done in the Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, are a figure of those things that we shall see in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen (as S.

Which also haue in our tyme so terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and hugely encreased, by nothinge more, then that we geue no eare to this one iudge: and that we do not, as our forefathers haue done, staye our selues, and depende vppon this the highest cowrte of all Christendome. Ye see nowe good reader both the figure, and the reason of the figure: what sayeth nowe M. Horne to it?<note place="margin">M. Horne setteth forth his ovvn ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts as thoughe they vver M. Feken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams.</note> Full pretely I warrante yow: and that is, that Maister Fekenham doth not aptly conclude, that <hi>the bisshoppes in the tyme of the Ghospell owght to haue iurisdiction by the expresse woorde of God, to kepe cowrts, to call Councells, to make Lawes, to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, and to reforme &amp; caet. because the highe priest, and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall iudge, did determyne doubtfull cases, in the tyme of the olde testament: for the priest alone did not determyne all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as M. Fekenham seameth to alleage the text.</hi> Here may yow playnelie see, that Maister Fekenham can not vse his owne armure, but such onely as Maister Horne wil graunt him. For neither M. Fekenham speaketh <hi>of the temporall iudge,</hi> nor his texte, be it Latin, Greke or Hebrewe. They
<pb facs="tcp:18356:485"/>
all speake of a iudge, but nothing is there to signifie this woorde <hi>temporall.</hi> This woorde is shamefully infarsed by Maister Horne, to vpholde his temporall supremacye, by this place most greauously battered. The iudge and the high Priest is al one, as doth appere by the letter, and by the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Kinge Iosaphat, which was conformable to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of Moyses, where as Amarias is appointed the chief for spiritual matters, as Zabadias was for those thinges that perteyned to the Kinges office. Which may be wel vnderstanded for the bodilie punishment of those that disobeyed the high priest, and to put them to death, yf the case required, according to the Lawe. And in that sense yt may be taken perchaunce for a temporal Iudge. This notwithstanding yt agreeth well enowghe, with the high priest to.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Mach.</hi> 14</note> For that diuerse tymes aswell before there were any Kings as afterward, the high priest had the cheif regiment, both temporal and Ecclesiasticall: but though he had not euer the temporal, yet had he euer the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call supremacy: And therefore it is writen of the Prophete Malachie,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mala.</hi> 2.</note> that <hi>the lipps of the priestes shall preserue knowledg, and they shall seke the lawe at his mowthe.</hi> And it is here wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,<note place="margin">

                     </note> al one person, and not two. And so S. Cyprian with the other fathers taketh place. When I speake of the high priest, I exclude not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the clergy, with whome the Pope, in all graue and weighty causes vseth to consult, and of congruence ought so to do, and so it was in the old Law. Neither M. Fekenham, as ye charge him, saith so, but layeth forth the text as it is, saying, that he
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:18356:485"/>
that disobeyeth the priest, shall die for it. Nowe the highe priest being this authorised, and Moses, Aaron, and Eleaza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus being successiuely the highe priestes, it must nedes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that they had the chiefe superiority for matters eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical, neding no further authority, then that they had by the expresse woorde of God, for the executing of theire office, whether it were in geuinge sentence, and making decrees Ecclesiasticall, or in visiting and reforming the priests, and Leuites that were vnderneth them: which if ye can shewe they did not, nor coulde do, but by the ciuill magistrates authority, we shall then geue you some eare. But ye proue it not, nor euer shall be able to proue this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxe. And therfore we passe not, whether it be true or no, that in the .29. of <hi>Exodus,</hi> there is neuer a worde of iurisdiction. It is sufficiente, that Maister Fekenham proue Aaron to haue bene the highe prieste, as he was in dede, and so yt appeareth there. Where nowe ye would returne against M. Fekenham the .24. of <hi>Exodus,</hi> ye haue forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten your selfe. For at that tyme Aaron was not yet made highe priest, but afterward he was so made, as appereth in the 3. chapter after: <hi>Videlicet cap. 28.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vide Exod.</hi> 24. <hi>&amp;.</hi> 28.</note> And therfore he might haue a commission to heare causes in Moses absence well inowgh: Moses being then both the prince, and the highe priest also, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d he, as is sayd, being yet no priest at al. For your answere to the .3. place by M. Fekenha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alleaged, we might passe it, sauing that by your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming in with <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim</hi> you haue much holpen M. Fekenha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his argument, and cut your self with your Thunim quite ouer the thume. For though theis outward miraculouse signes, do not nowe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in our high priest, yet the thing that was signified by <hi>Vrim</hi> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <hi>Thunim</hi> set in the brestplate of the high priest, that
<pb facs="tcp:18356:486"/>

And therfore the true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is to be fetched at the high priests or bisshops hands, in al doubts and perplexities of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequently all lawes, decrees, and ordinau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, made for the obseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are to be obserued.

                  <p>We haue here a Lawe of Constantine, that those that be of the Clergie, may choose whether they wil answere for any matter, what so euer it be before a laie man.

In such Consta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tine geueth the bishops no iurisdiction, for they had it before. Neither is there here any one woorde, that the Bishoppes should neither summon Councelles, nor make

ecclesiastical Lawes without the Princes consent. Here is a plaine ordinaunce that the lay Magistrates shal see, that the Synodical Decrees shall be put in execution. Wherby contrary to the conclusion that ye mainteine through out this your answere, it well appeareth, that the Princes part is onely to see, that the Ecclesiasticall decrees made by the Bishops be kept and put in vre, and not to haue any neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie consente, in the allowing, or disallowing of them.</p>

                  <p>There followeth now an other reason out of the newe testamente, browght forth by M. Fekenham.

And bishops they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led those, whiche in olde time were called Apostles. So Epaphroditus was the Apostle of the Philippenses, so Titus of the people of Creta, and Timothe of the Asians. Thus then, those which were in dede Bishops, being in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles time called Priestes, verely in this place also of the Actes, by these wordes Priests, may very wel be taken not

only simple Priests, but euen those that were Bishops too. And then hath M. Horne lost al the grace of his Pharisaical iesting. But now is the man in a great muse with him selfe, whether he may graunt to M.

                     <hi>Your vvhole drifte in this parte is, to proue that Bishoppes and Priestes may visite, geue the holy Ghoste, by the imposition of their handes: and make lavves orders, and decrees to their flockes and cures. Your proufe consisteth in the example of the Apostles, and this is your argument: The Apostles visited, gaue the holy Ghost, and made Lavves, orders, and decrees, vnto their flockes and cures,</hi> Ergo, <hi>Bishoppes and Priestes, haue authoritie and may make Lavves, visit and geue the holy Ghost to their flockes and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. The insufficiency of this consequent, doth easely appeare, to those that doo consider the state and condicion of the Apostleship, and compare ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvith the office of a Bishop or Priest. The Apostles did, might, and could doo, many thinges that Bishoppes and Priestes, neither may, nor can do. The matter is more plaine than that needeth any proufe. But as the sequele faileth in forme, so let vs consider the matter, vvhervpon ye grounde the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quele, that your frindes may see vvhat foule shiftes ye are driuen to make, for the maintenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of an vniust claime.

For the scriptures report so much in effect.</note> 
                     <hi>feine the Scriptures to say, that it saieth not: for in the eight of the Actes, there is no mencio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made of any visitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the other place speaketh only of a</hi> (.604.)<note place="margin">The .604. vntruth.

                     <hi>Scripturely visitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and nothing at al of your Forinsecall or Canon Lavve visitation.

                     <hi>knovveth not.

                     <hi>againste the Scriptures. The personnes that may lavvfullye visite in youre Canon Lavve visitation,</hi> are Popes, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates from the side: Legates sent and borne, Legates and messengers of the Apostolik sea, Patriarches, Archebishoppes, Bishoppes, Archdeacons, Deanes, Archepriestes, Abbottes, and other inferiour personnes hauing iurisdiction.

All these visitours muste beginne their visitation with a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne Masse of the holy ghost. The Bishoppe and euery ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary visitour, must beginne his visitation at his Cathedrall

Churche and Chapter. He must come into the Church where he visiteth, and first kneele downe and pray deuoutly, chieflie directing his eies and mind to the place wherein the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Christes Body is hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and kepte. <hi>The matters of the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Lavve visitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are in parte these.</hi> The visitour ought to view dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, whether the place wher the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is kept, be cleane, wel garnished and close, for the Eucharist, and the holy Chrysme ought to be kept shut vnder locke and key. He must see, that there be great lightes of waxe to geue light in that place, The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must he visit the place of the holy reliquies, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of Baptisme.

Besides this he muste visit the Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars and litle Chappelles, and must with his eies viewe the whole Church whether it be clea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly and cleane. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he must visit the vesselles and Churche vestymentes, whether they be cleane, and kepte in a cleane place, as they ought to be, and whether the vestime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes be ouermuche worne and broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and in case the visitour shal finde suche vestime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes vncleane, re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sumed with occupying, he muste burne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the fire, and cause the ashes to be buried in some place, whereby ther is no passage. But in any wise let him not suffer (<hi>saith Socius)</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses or such like thinges to worldly vse to be made of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes or tunicles. Last of al, let him suruey the houses and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions belonging to the Churche. The Bishop dooth visit also, to bisshop enfantes, and to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrate or hallow Churches. The visitour also shall enquire and examine, whether any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knowe or beleeue, or that the fame is, that the Sexten, the Treasurer, or the Vesture keeper, hath well and saufly kepte, the vessels, vestimentes, and other thinges or ornamentes of the Churche, as Masse bookes, Grayles, Antiphoners, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendes, and other thinges appointed to diuine Seruice, and whether any thing moueable, or vnmoueable, be diminished, and by whome, wherefore, whan, and after what sorte, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be diligently present at the Dirigees for the dead. And whether the vesture keeper or Sexten, keepe warelie

cleanly the Churche, the Eucharist, the Reliques, the Fount, the Churchyardes, and suche other things. And he shal exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Priestes in the countrie in saying of their Masses.</p>
                  <p>But lette euerye Visitour vnderstande (<hi>saith mine Authour</hi>) that same the greatest question or controuersie which was betwixt three rurall Personnes or Priestes: vvherof tvvo of them stroue about the vvoordes of Consecration, the one affirming, that the vvordes are to be pronounced thus: Hoc est corpus meus: the other, Hoc est corpus (I <hi>thinke he should haue said</hi> corpum) me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. These tvvo chose a thirde Prieste, vvho vvas taken to be better learned, to be arbitour, and to decide this high question: vvhose ansvvere vvas, that he him selfe stoode euer doubtfull in this question: and therfore in steede of these vvordes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration, did alvvaies vse to saye one Pater noster. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more the Visitour must enquire, vvhether the laity make their confession once in the yeare, and receiue the Euchariste at Easter. And vvhether they be slovve, or denie to paie their tythes and fruites. The Archebisshoppe must in visiting any of his Suffraganes, exactly enquire and examine the Canons and Clerkes of the Cathedrall Churche, vvhether they knovv, beleue, or that the fame is, that the Bisshop hath couered or borne vvith some mens faultes for money, or other temporall commoditie. <hi>Can you finde in the Scriptures any one of these Visitours, or anie one of these vveightie matters enquired of, by Peter, Iohn, Paule, Sylas, Barnabas, or by any of the Apostles in their Visitations, vvhich vvere Scripturely visitations?

                     <hi>against the greatest parte of the matter vvhereabout your Popish or Canon Lavve visitation is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: Euen so the holy Scripture that you auouche, for the geuing of the holie Ghoste, maketh</hi> (.611.)<note place="margin">The .611 Vntruthe.

                     <hi>nothing at all to proue your purpose. For Saint Luke in that place speaketh</hi> (.612.)<note place="margin">The 612. Vntruthe. For he speaketh bothe of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie vse of that Sacrament, and of the extraordinarie gift of Miracles,</note> 
                     <hi>not of an ordinarie povver, that shoulde remaine in the ministers of the Churche for euer, but of a speciall gifte to vvorke miracles, and to geue that povver to others, vvhiche shoulde continue but for the time vvhiles Christes Churche vvas to be erected, and the vvoord to be sounded through the vvorlde: And therefore Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome saieth: That this gift pertained onely to the Apostles. For (saieth he) the Conuertes in Samaria had receiued before Peter and Iohn came, the spirit of Remission of Sinnes: But the spirite of Myracles, that is, the gift of tongues, healing, propheci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and suche like, vvhich are the giftes of the holie Ghoste, and therefore are called the Holie Ghoste, they had not as yet recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. There vvere many that by the povver of Goddes Spirite coulde vvorke miracles, but to geaue this povver to others, none coulde doe but the Apostles. For that vvas propre and onelye in them.

                     <hi>you argue: the Apostles gaue by the imposition of their handes, to the Samaritanes, the giftes of Healing, Prophecying, of Tongues, &amp;c. Therefore euerye Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop and Priest hath povver to geue the same gifts to their flocks and cures. There vvas neuer none so blind or so ignorantly brought vp in your cures, belonging to the Abbey of VVestminster, but that did vvel perceiue, that neither your Bisshops, Abbottes, or Priests, had or could doe any such feate. They like Apes, imitated the outvvarde signe or ceremonie, but the invvard grace they vvanted.</hi>

being a special prerogatiue gratiously geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to him. But here we must vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that Peter was priuileged for his owne person, and he was priuileged also, in respect, of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale of the whole Church. And therfore yf we respect S. Peters person, the perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his successor is not so priuileged, but he may fal and erre in his own priuat opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. But if we respect the whole Church, whereof he hath the rule, then we say he can not erre in any decree or order that he shal publikely make for any matter of faith: Least by this his ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> errour the whole Church fal also into the same.

                  <p>Again, the Apostles had personal priuileges of more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple grace, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their successours haue. And therfore by theis wordes, <hi>what so euer, ye shall bynde vppon the earth &amp;c.</hi> And by those other, <hi>as my father sent me, so I send you:</hi> they had authority eche of them to preach throughout the whole world and in whatsoeuer part therof: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in this respect they were equal with S. Peter: but their successours at Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, Antiochia, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Ephesus do not succede to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor inioy this extraordinary powre of preaching a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d teachi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g through out the world, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d euery part therof, but the ordinary o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vsual power within their own Diocesse or Patriarchship. The said extraordinary authority remayni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g with the popes only as the successours of S. Peter: who was head of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles (not in the Apostleship for in that all the Apostles were equall) but in bishoply Iurisdiction. After lyke sort the Apostles had a certain peerlesse authority to speak in diuers tongs, to prophecy, to reuiue the dead, to heale the sicke, to cast out diuels, and to do many other miracles. This power doth not desce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to al their successours ordinately, but now and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to some certain, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it pleaseth God, to dispe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce

M.

that the Apostles set forth in holy scripture, which Christe him selfe taught the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: as concerning baptisme, the holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charistia, and some other thinges. Some other lawes there are that the Apostles set forth, but not suche as they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at Christes own ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, and by his mouth, but by his holy spirite after his ascension: whiche are for that cause called Christes a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Gods lawes: as for that the Apostles had al their authority to make suche lawes of him,<note place="margin">A differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <hi>I wil dispose other things when I come.</hi> Which is the place M. Fekenham groundeth him self vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against you. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon S. Augustine thinketh, <hi>that whiche is vniformely and generally vsed throughout Christendome, touching the order in the administration of this Sacrament, to haue ben ordeined by S. Paule, which he could not so conueniently prescribe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point in his Epistle.</hi> So that ye see, that though it be true, these orders and lawes may be called Gods ordinau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces and lawes, yet they are and may also well be called, the lawes and ordinaunces of the Apostles. And thus M. Fekenhams Argument standeth as before, in his ful force euery way. And all your talke concerning the Lords supper, is quite from the purpose. You tell vs, that all was Gods Law that S. Paule appointed in the saide Epistle to the Corinthians. Which if it were so, yet ye reason not against M. Feken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, who speaketh not of those things that he tooke order for in his Epistle, but of those things that he toke order for at his comming. Whereof he said: <hi>Caetera cùm venero, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponam,</hi> Other things I wil set in order when I come. Which as they were done without writing (as many things also that he deliuered by tradition to the Thessalonians, as M. Fekenham rehearseth out of S. Paule) so were they done against your fond conclusion, that is, without any other warrant of any lay persons. Neither is the ordinaunce of praying and preaching, the head vncouered, proprely Gods law: for then had it bene indispensable: And then had you and your fellowes, that preache with your cappe on your heades, nede to thinke vpon some good answeare, for the violating of Gods Law. And wemen come to the Church to be maried with their heads open, whiche might not be
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:18356:508"/>
suffred, if it were directly against Gods law. And though S. Paul geueth this reason of superioritie, and subection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (as it seemeth) it was a custome or maner proper to the Iewes, yet both among the Romaines and other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils, in S. Paules time, and also throughout al Christendome at this daie, the opening and discouering of the heade, is a token of subiection, and of duetifull honour to our Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates and other Superiours.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, if we consider the Scripture well we shall finde, that S. Paule and the Apostles gaue many precepts in their Epistles, of which in the written Gospell, nothing is mentioned or ordeined. And so your Lutheran Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wil appeare starke false and dangerouse, where you say:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vide Hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacolo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. L. Campestri co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiam. An.</hi> 1523.</note> 
                     <hi>That Paul gaue not his owne lawes beside the Ghospel, but Gods ordinaunces comprehended within his Ghospell.</hi> And againe, <hi>That Paule whether being present, he taught them by worde, or being absent, by writing, he neither wrote nor spake other then he had receiued of the Lorde.</hi> And last of al, <hi>So that the traditions that Paule speaketh of, are not other then the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Ghospell.</hi> This is, M. Horne (as I said) a Lutheran and a dangerous conclusion. For by this rule you woulde frustrate al the lawes of the Church (as Luther your Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir did) which are not expressely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Ghospell.

And therefore thoughe he politykely relented at this time, yet afterwarde at the councel at Tyrus he shewed hym selfe as supreame Iudge in causes Ecclesiasticall.</hi>

For ye that are indewed with the grace of God, and shyne brightlie with that light, may much better make this election.</hi> The Emperour also vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that S.

Ambrose) <hi>to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted mens bodies.</hi> For before S. Ambrose was chosen bisshop of Millane, he was the gouernour of those quarters vnder the Emperour. But to put the matter out of doubt, let vs harken to S.

Ambrose an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered: <hi>Sir: your father did not onely say it in wordes, but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned by a law, that in matters touching fayth, or ecclesiastical order, he ought to be iudg, that is neither vnequal in office, nor vnlike in right. For theis are the words of his rescript or Law: that is, that priests should be iudges vpon priestes. Yea if a priest
<pb facs="tcp:18356:517"/>
were otherwise accused, and that he were to be examined of his manners and lyfe, he would that the bisshops should be iudges.</hi> Wherfore his owne lawe may best serue, for the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his answere made to the bisshops of <hi>Hellespontus.</hi> And this with the other premisses declare euidently, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours meaning, and that he thought it did not properly belong to him, but to the bishops, to intermedle with the affayres Ecclesiasticall.</p>
                  <p>Neither doth Nicephorus any thing hinder our purpose. For that, that he saith, wil wel stand with Sozomenus. And it is probable the Emperour sayd both. And as yt is in holy scripture, that one place supplieth the defect of the other: so is it also in chroniclers. And that perchaunce ye sawe your self, and therfore ye runne to your accustomable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as yt were to your Bulwork, <hi>that the princes had autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to call councels, and not the bishops: for else</hi> (say you) <hi>what neaded them to haue craued Licence of themperour</hi>? Wherein I answer, they neaded his ayde for oportunyte of time and place. And as at all tymes the bishops haue wrought in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Councels with the princes assista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, so at this time, (the Arrians and other heretiks bearing such a sway in the worlde) yt was great wisedome, to attempte no councell without notice geuen to the prince, and his consente had thereunto. Namely considering what persequutions the Catholikes of late had suffred vnder the Arrian Emperour Constantius, and that theire decrees could not be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally executed against rebelliouse heretyks, who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temned excommunication, and al other Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, neither they them selues coulde safely and quietly assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble together, without the speciall ayde of the Prince.</p>

This I say, I wil now leaue largelie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to discourse vppon (.3.) and also that this Storie destroyeth your other heresie, that Priests do not remit sinnes, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare onely sinnes to be remitted. For Theodosius confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that by the sentence of this Bishoppe, he was excluded not only from the Church, but from heauen also. I wil now discourse only, whether this storie be aptly brought foorth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>(.4.) for M. Fekenhams purpose, which ye denie. But he that doth not see most euidentlie, that this Storie proueth S. Ambrose, for causes Ecclesiastical to haue bene the head of the Church of Millaine, and not the Emperour, he will neuer see any truth, as long as he liueth, and is like to him that in a faire sunny daie stoppeth his eyes with his handes at midnoone, and then crieth out that they are fooles, that saie it is daie lighte. No, no, euery man may easely see by this Storie, that the tenour of your othe can not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie be iustified: whereby men are vrged to swere, that the Prince is supreme head not in one or two, but <hi>in AL cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses or things ECCLESIASTICAL.</hi> Surely an vntrue and an horrible proposition. The which S. Ambrose, if he now liued, rather then he woulde confesse, he woulde be dismembred with wilde horses. This is to open, and to eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent an absurditie, and though ye will not, or dare not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse it with plaine wordes,<note place="margin">M. Horns starting holes, vvhen he is pressed mere.</note> yet as we haue declared, it may be wel gathered your selfe doe not like it. And therfore ye craftelie wind your selfe from that, as much as ye may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siblie, and finde many starting holes: as in the former leafe, <hi>That out of Constantinus Storie it may not be gathered, that
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:18356:520"/>
Bisshoppes haue all manner of Cohibitiue Iurisdiction.</hi> And here: <hi>that it can not be proued by this Storie of Theodosius, that they haue the seconde Cohibitiue Iurisdiction.</hi> But in case out of bothe it may be gathered (as it is in deede ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarilie gathered) that the Prince is not supreame Heade in all matters Ecclesiastical: then is Maister Fekenham free from taking the Othe, as being such, as neither he, nor any good man may with safe conscience receiue.</p>
                  <p>Now further, what if of this Storie, it shalbe proued most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> euidently, that Bishops haue not only the .2. Cohibitiue, but the first Cohibitiue too, as ye call it? And that it is so, I sette fast footing, and ioyne issue with you. And first, for your first Cohibitiue Iurisdiction, as ye call it, in which by you is comprehended exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, whiche ye see here practised without any Princes commission, yea vppon the Prince him selfe. And as no man euer read or hearde, that S. Ambrose had any other commission, either from Prince or from his Churche, to excommunicate Theodosius, and that as it is not likely, that the whole Church and Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Millaine woulde agree to the exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication of the Emperour: or that they had any such authoritie: So a man may doubte, whether there were any one laie man or Priest, that was of such courage, as herein to ioyne with S.

This is he, whose institutions against Christ, and the true diuine religion, are in such price with you, that there be few of your protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te fellowe Bisshops that wil admit any man, to any cure, that hath not reade them, or wil not promise to reade them. The Catholiks deny your new supremacy: the Lutherans also deny it: Caluin calleth it blasphemous. Howe can then any Catholike man persuade his conscience to take this othe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">M. Horne is not a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to M. Feck. touching Caluin that saith it is blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy to cal the Prince head of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che.</note>And what say you now at length to this authority M. Horne? Mary saith he: <hi>I say, that though it be true, yet it will no more followe thereof that Bishops may make lawes, orders, and decrees, then of his former saying: that Christ gaue to the Churche authority to excommunicate, to binde, and to lose.</hi> In dede ye say truthe for the one, it is but a slender argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente: The Ciuil Magistrate is heade of the Churche: <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> Bisshoppes may make Lawes: and Maister Fekenham was neuer yet so yll aduised and so ouersene, as to frame such madde argumentes. This argumente cometh fresh and newe hammered out of your owne forge. But for the other parte, if a man woulde reason thus, Bishoppes haue power to binde and to loose: <hi>Ergo</hi> they haue power to
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:18356:526"/>
make lawes, orders and decrees <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he should not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son amisse: seing that by the iudgement of the learned, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of binding and loosing, the power of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king lawes is contayned. Which also very reason for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth. For who haue more skill to make lawes and orders for directing of mens consciences, then such whose whole study and office consisteth in instructing and refourming mens consciences? But Maister Fekenham doth not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son so, but thus. It is blasphemy to call the Prince heade of the Church: <hi>Ergo</hi> Maister Fekenham can not with saufe conscience take the othe of the supremacy, and that the Prince is the supreme head. Againe the Prince hath no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or iurisdiction to binde or lose, or to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate: <hi>Ergo,</hi> M. Fekenham can not be persuaded to swere to that statute that annexeth and vniteth al iurisdiction to the Prince, and to swere that the Prince is supreme gouernour in all causes Ecclesiastical. These be no childish matters M. Horne. Leaue of this your fonde and childishe dealings, and make vs a directe answere to the arguments as M. Feken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham proposeth them to you: and soyle them well and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, and then finde faulte with him, yf ye wil, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing the othe. But then am I sure, ye wil not be ouer hastie vpon him, but wyll geue him a breathing tyme for this seue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yeres at the least, and for your life to. For as long as your name is Robert Horne ye shall neuer be able to soyle them. Neither thinke you, that in matters of suche importance, wise men and such as haue the feare of God before their eies, wil be carried away from the Catholike faith with such kind of aunsweres.</p>

And not they only, but such Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours also, as either for negligence or feare forslowe to do theyr dewtie: whether it be in the exercising of the pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral word, or els of the pastoral sworde: and suche chiefly as take awaie from them, and deny them theyr pastoral sword. Which heresie tendeth to the vtter destruction of al eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall power and discipline: which power is (as all other things of the newe testament are) verie plainely shadowed, by the old Testament: Namely by these wordes of God spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Hieremy, representinge the parson of the Christian Pastour: expressed, as yt were, by the office of an hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman or gardiner: or as Ezechiell expresseth his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, by the office of a Shepherde. As the husbandman doeth not onelie donge and fatte hys grounde: as the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner doeth not onelie water hys garden, but bothe of
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:18356:540"/>
them rooteth out vnprofitable herbes, weedes, and rootes: And as the shepherd doth not only bring his flocke to good and holsome pastours, but hath his tarre, to tarre them, his staffe to beate awaye the rauenouse beastes and birdes, his knyfe to launce them, and his place to sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and shutte vp the infected from the sownd and whole: Euen so it is not inough for the spiritual gardiner, as it were by Gods worde to water the harde stonie hartes of the sinners, and with the same as it were to fatte the leane and barren harte of man: but he must also, when the case so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, weed out of Christes garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the wilful, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinat: as it were brambles, briers, and thistles choking the good grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te in their place other good graffes. And must not only with his to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, as it were with his barki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g dog, but with hys pastorall staffe also dryue awaye the wolfe from the flocke: partly by excommunication, partly by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priuation. And he must in this part remember, that Christe had his whip also, to whip and scourge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple that prophaned the same. The spiritual pastour hath beside preaching, authority also to bind and lose the sinnes of hys flocke: so that if he lose the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Christ loseth them: if he bindeth them, Christ also bindeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

And so is Moses, so are others also, called in scripture me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatours. I would now knowe of this scrupulouse conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed man concerninge the other poynt, whether, in case a prince did appoint any one man in his realme, to geue out his pardon in his name to such as were offendours, and that no man shoulde ones loke to enioy any pardon, but hauing recourse to this his deputy: I say I woulde knowe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by thys the prince shoulde be counted inferiour to his subiecte.</p>
                  <p>But what meane I, to defende that renowmed auncient Father and his golden mouth, against the foolish blast of so lewde an horners mouth? What nede I seeke any defence for the wordes alleaged by M. Fekenham, when that, M. Horne is quite ouerblowen with his owne blast: telling vs by his own allegation, yea truely, and out of the said Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome, that <hi>the king hath the administratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of earthly things, and beside this power hath no further authority.</hi> The matter also of his Ministery, sayth M. Horne, is but earthly and outwarde. <hi>Ergo</hi> say I for M. Fekenham, the kinge is not su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame head in all causes Ecclesiasticall, or spiritual. What say I in all causes? Nay not in one cause mere spirituall or Ecclesiasticall: as hauing nothing to doe in any such, but in worldly and earthly causes only. And thus ye see, howe wel theis two fathers, Gregory Nazianzene, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Iohn Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome the two greate pillers of the Greke Church, may be easely drawen without any great force, to helpe M. Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenhams cause.</p>
                  <p>Here nowe by the way, may be noted, that M. Horne, for al his great reading, and for all the want of reading that he fyndeth in M. Fekenham, hath wonderfully ouershotte him selfe, and hath by his ouersight lost a ioly triumphante
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:18356:543"/>
matter that he might haue had, to haue triumphed vppon M. Feke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ham. He might haue sayd, I pray you M. Feke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ham: was Iulian the wicked Apostata a sheepe of Christes flock, being a renegate, a panyme, and a most cruel persequutour of the Christians? What?

                  <p>M. Fekenham concluding his obiections with Ignatius adioyneth a general protestation of his faith taken out of blessed S. Augustin his bookes against the heretike Iulianus. Thus. <hi>That they belieue, I belieue: that they hold, I hold: that they teache, I teache: that they preache, I preach: yeld to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and thow shalt yelde to me.</hi> Here doth M. Horne so reuell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst M. Fekenha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as he hath not don the like in all his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere. First he denieth, that of this place of S. Augustine may any good sequele be gathered, that Bishops may make lawes, or vse al cohibitiue iurisdiction. Then as hauing now M. Fekenham in such a fowle euident faulte, as by no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text maye be couered, he thinketh that for this false dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, his owne frendes wil take him, for a deape dissembler, yea rather will abhorre him as an open slaunderer and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier of the fathers, as a manifest mangler, alterer, peruerter, and corrupter of S. Augustine. For in stede of <hi>istis cede, &amp; me non caedes,</hi> yelde to them, and thou shalt strike or whip me, he hath put in: <hi>istis cede, &amp; mihi cedes.</hi> Yelde to them, and thow shalt yelde to me. And then saith further, that belike M. Fekenham will not sticke to corrupte that which maketh flatte against him, that thus vseth to corrupt that, which maketh neither to nor fro, with him self, nor against him selfe. After this he rolleth in S. Augustines sentences,
<pb facs="tcp:18356:548"/>
and layth them forth against M. Feke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for this his euil dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with him, as S. Augustin doth against Pelagius a Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn monke. Finally as though now the battel were wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, and a ful conquest made vpon poore. M. Fekenham, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vpon him to yelde and relente. Mary sir this is a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blaste in dede blowen out of Maister Hornes mouth for his farewell: This is such a blustering tempest sturred vp by our newe Aeolus, that (as it seemeth) M. Fekenham must nedes be ouerblowen with the vehemency of yt. But we will yet seeke out, and see the very foundation, and the original cause of all this broyle. By al likelihodde M. Fekenham hath founde some good apparance of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage in corrupting these wordes of S. Augustin. For no man lightly is so doltish, to vse such foule and sluttish shifts, without some co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort and hope to further his matter by. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the old saying <hi>Cui bono.</hi> Nay saith M. Horn: The corrupting of the sentence serueth no whit the more for M. Fekenha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s purpose. No doth it not M. Horne? and would M. Fekenha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deale so fondly by ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> falshod to staine his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for <hi>whippe me,</hi> tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slate, <hi>yelde to me,</hi> without any be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nefit of his cause? Suerly the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were he worthy (aswel as I loue him) to be twise whipped, once for falshod, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ons more for folly. Therefore this your accusation eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by your own tale, and by <hi>Cui bono,</hi> is vtterly incredible.</p>
                  <p>And yet yf he had so falsly and so folishly demeaned him self, seing it toucheth no part of the substance of the questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that lieth betwixt you a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him: you playe with him yf not a folish, yet to veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t an oratour: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d haue sauced your ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory with ouer much gal a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d egernes.

order, yet by forgetfulnes M. Fekenham hath not set in the booke. And wil ye see, howe wel the matter is amended by M. Horne?

                  <p>The perfourming of his promise was as hereafter fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. First there was a rumour spersed abroade very shortly after by his seruantes, that I had subscribed to certaine articles, tenne in number.</p>
                  <p>Second, there was by his seruantes a further rumour raised, of my recantation, time and place appointed therof to be at the Parishe Church of VValtham, where his L. did then manure and abide.</p>
                  <p>Thirdely, his L. did at his open table, and in the praesence of many, chardge me with the change of my Religion nine times, and beinge putte in further remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance by one M. Denny who was a Sogener with him, his L. saied, that I had altered and chaunged my Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not onely nine times, but nineteene times, and that I was of no Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:18356:552"/>Fourth, his L. did permitte the saied M. Denny at his open table to to much to abuse me. Where the saied M. Dennie did openly and before manie, chardge me with these three crimes following. First, with incontinencie of life, thus saying: That if I had not as many children, as he, he did knowe, that I had deserued to haue so manie. Second, with glottonie, affirming that I was an Epicure. Third and last, with hypocrisie, and that I was a greate dissembler and an hypocrite. The saied M. Dennie being a man to me wholly vnknowen. His L. did shewe him self openly to be so well pleased with these his slaunderouse wordes, that he ministred iust occasion for me to thinke, that his L. had procured the saied M. Dennie therevnto.</p>
                  <p>Fifth, by so much the more I had good cause to thinke so, for that his L. did immediatly therevpon, viz. within one houre after, in fortifiyng the saied talke, commaunde me to close imprisonment.</p>
                  <p>Sixth and last, after that he had kept me sixe weekes in close imprisonment, by his L. complaint I am nowe at this present prisoner in the Tower, much contrary to his promise before made.</p>
                  <p>The premisses being true (lyke as they are all moste true) being to openly commited, and before to many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses to be denied: your Honour may easily iudge, with what wisedome, discretion, and charitie I haue hene vsed, I being a poore man, the Q.

his L. committed (I dare boldly affirme) to be well vsed. It was very straunge to me, to see suche behauiour openly shewed at the table of such a man. Surely for mine owne parte, I was neuer so vsed, neither openly nor priuately at any mans table before in my whole life. My humble sute therefore vnto your Honour is, that proufe and trial may he had of my trueth herein, and what my deseruings hath bene for the whole time of mine abode there. In due search and examination hereof I doubt not but there shal fall out matter betwixt vs, either of much simplicitie and trueth, or els of greate crafte and falsehood: either of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, vertuouse and godly, or els dishonest, vitiouse and vngodly vsage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and either of much light, learning, and knowledge, or els of very grosse ignoraunce, and palpable darkenesse: let it fall and light on the whiche side it shall happe, vppon the triall and examination made, I doubt not, but that your Honour shall haue a full shewe and a sufficient proufe made, of euery thing that hath passed betweene vs. There may be deniall made for a shifte and some short time: but for any long time it may not possibly endure, euery thing being so openly committed and done, so diuerse and manie beyng of knowledge and witnesse thereof.</p>

                  <p>THis being the last parte of all, standeth moste vppon mutuall accusations: M. Fekenham fynding him selfe greaued, that he should be missused at M. Hornes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and there to be noted of incontinencie, gluttonie, and hypocrisie: that rumours should be spread abrode by M. Hornes seruantes of his subscription and recantation: and finally that contrary to M. Hornes promise made to hym, that he should suffer no domage or hurte for any wordes passed betwixt them, he was first restrained of his libertie accustomable by M. Horne, and kepte there close prisoner vj. wekes: and afterward by his procurement remitted to the Towre.</p>
                  <p>M. Horne on the other side denieth, that euer he was priuie to any such rumour, and complayneth as fast vppon M. Fekenham, and his disorder, as calling M. Deny Epicure at his owne table, and for openly calling him self almost in plaine termes heretike. He putteth M. Feke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ham in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of certaine talke passed betwene them: <hi>as that a man may fast aswell with fleshe, as with fishe: of mortall and deadly synne,</hi> and other matters. As for the restraynte of his liberty, he sayth it came vppon his owne disorder: and that in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>playning vpon him to the Councell, he brake no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse with him. These matters then being such as priuately passed betwene them, I beinge one that neither was then present, nor yet sithence fully vnderstanding any certainty of them, must leaue this to M. Fekenhams owne defence,
<pb facs="tcp:18356:555"/>
when the time shal serue. Sauing that so muche, I can say, that I haue bene credibly enformed, that M. Feke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ham doth deny, as wel that he misused M. Deny, as such other things as M. Horne chargeth him withal, and is ready to stand to, and to iustifie al such things as are conteined in this his she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule if he may be suffred. And suerly among other things, to them that knewe his order and diet, either before his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to prison, either in the towre, when he had the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the same, wheras I am credibly enformed, he neuer made three meales, it can not seme credible and likely, that he shuld at Waltham as M. Horne saith, make three meales, aswel friday as other daies.</p>
                  <p>One thing I am sure of M. Horn, he toke no part of your fleshly breakfasts and suppers, that ye haue had in good store in your house vppon the fridaies and other fasting daies. Which example to be shewed in your house, being a man of such vocation and countenaunce, against the Lawes of the Church and the realme, how it may be allowed, I leaue it to the consideration of others. For I suppose neither your self, nor Maistres Madge, with al your other fleshly compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, are fallen into suche weaknes, feblenes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, nor are of so timerouse and scrupulouse a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, that either ye neade, or will tarrie for a Licence: I wil not say to be sought at Rome, but nearer hand, at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Which (to make an ende hereof shortly) is as much to say, as euery sicknesse infirmitie or disease is of it self death. For as the body liueth by the soule, so the soule liueth by
<pb facs="tcp:18356:559"/>
God. As the body dieth, when the soule is separated from it, so the soule dieth, when God is gone from it. Which matter S. Augustin most excellently handleth in his notable worke <hi>de Ciuitate Dei.</hi>

Which euil men doe, without any fight or combat at al. But good men either not at al, or very seldom and after great fight: and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are they no more good men or the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, but are nowe become the children of wrathe, so to perish euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stingly, except they repente. This is a greate and a clere di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction betwene mortal sinne and venial synne.</p>
                  <p>Now where you adde, that though euery synne be of yt selfe mortal, yet <hi>it is also venial to be purged by the merites of Christ only,</hi> yf you take venial for pardonable or remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, we grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te, euery synne be it neuer so mortall, is in such a sense venial the synne against the holy Ghoste, which is finall impenite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, alonely excepted. But yf you take venial, as it is an opposite to mortal, as M. Fekenha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> toke it, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:18356:559"/>
auouched that by a godly ceremony venial synnes may be remitted, and as you must take it, yf you wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary M. Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenhams assertion, then are you in an other foule errour. For as the venial synne is not mortal (as I haue proued) so neither is any mortal synne venial, as longe as it is mortall. This confounding of degrees in synne, to make all mortall, is a Stoical and Barbarous paradoxe, opening the gate to al dissolutenesse and licentiousnesse: not only co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to truth and lerning, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to good life and good maners. And it semeth to agree iumpe with Luthers paradoxe, wherein he taught and defended, <hi>That a good worke, be it neuer so wel done, is according to the mercy of God a venial sinne and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God a mortal sinne.</hi>

                  <p>Where you adde, <hi>by the merites of Christe onely,</hi> yf you meane as by the principal effect, and by the vertue wherof only all other workes of men are auaylable and meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, I grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t you say wel.

And thus the Crosse that came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Iesuites to M. Feken. came in a good howre. As by the occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherof, you haue discouered vnto you some of your lurking heresies, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the Catholike faith is somwhat opened (more perhaps the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you wold it wer) to al such as haue grace to harke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thervnto.

But see you not, that when ye saye there is no mortall sinne, but the sinne against the holy Ghoste, howe contrary you are to your selfe, saying that al sinnes are mortal, and yet againe affirming there is no mortal sinne at all, but one? Whereby ye go very nere to the Pelagians heresie, taking away ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall sinne. For if there be no mortall sinne, but the sinne against the holy Ghoste (that is, lacke of repentance, as Wicleff declareth) then did not Adam co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitte any mortal
<pb facs="tcp:18356:561"/>
sinne: for he died penitently.<note place="margin">

                  <p>Neither wil it helpe you to say, that there is no synne, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing lacke of repentaunce, but is purged by the merits of Christ. For the question is not, when we speake of veniall and mortall synne, howe it may be taken away or forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, but what payne and penalty eche of his owne nature deserueth.
