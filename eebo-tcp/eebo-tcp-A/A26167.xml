            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note> THE Subſtance of what follows was intended to be ſpoken by me before a <hi>Committee</hi> of the late Houſe of <hi>Commons;</hi> but my <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients</hi> at the Bar, thought it better to rely upon the ſuppoſed Defect of Proof for the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters alledged againſt the <hi>Eaſt-India Company,</hi> than to juſtify the Fact; which if proved, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, was likely to have that Conſequence which is well known to have hapned.</p>
            <p>I have here conſidered all the Objections which have occurred to me againſt the Exerciſe of ſuch Powers, as 'tis not to be denied but the Company thought were warrantable.</p>
            <p>I urge not this as if an Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> for ſetling convenient Powers were needleſs, or not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by them; but to ſhew that thoſe their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which have been moſt complained of, have not been without Precedent and Countenance from <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Authorities.</hi>

The paſſing Sentence of Death, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Men, by the Governor at St. <hi>Helena,</hi> in a Method not wholly agreeable to the Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> or elſe the procuring a Commiſſion from the King, for trying and executing Men there, by <hi>Martial Law.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Firſt ſeizing Ships and Goods.</note> I.

A <hi>Prerogative</hi> to forbid Trade with <hi>Infidels,</hi> who remaining perpetual Enemies to the Nation, yet were to be Friends to part: and this upon a Principle that would reſtrain the Propagation of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as well as of <hi>Trade;</hi> as if the Danger of being infected with their Infidelity were greater than the hopes of converting them: or that they who were free of ſuch a <hi>Company</hi> had a particular Antidote againſt it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The other ground, though not ſo ridiculous, has leſs colour of Law, which was the King's Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for the benefit of particular Perſons, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with <hi>Acts of Parliament</hi> reſtraining Trade; from whence they would infer an equal Power of reſtraining, where <hi>Common or Statute Law</hi> gave a Liberty. But without the help of ſuch falſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums, I doubt not to prove very plainly, that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109752:3"/>
neither Common nor Statute Law, give any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for <hi>interloping</hi> within the Extent of the <hi>Eaſt-India Company's Charter:</hi> and that ſuch as trade thither, not being of the <hi>Company,</hi> or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed by them, incur the Forfeiture of the Ships and Goods with which they interlope, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Law of England,</hi> as it has been taken ever ſince Foreign Trade appears to have fallen under its Regard.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Company's Charter</hi> and <hi>Proclamations</hi> thereupon prohibit <hi>interloping</hi> upon ſuch Penalties, is not denied: So that the only Queſtion here is, What Countenance ſuch <hi>Prohibitions</hi> have in our Law.</p>

            <q>Alſo the ſaid Commons pray that ſince our Lord the King has granted to the People of <hi>Flanders,</hi> that the Staples for Wools be in the Town of <hi>Bruges;</hi> at the time of which Grant all manner of Merchants, <hi>viz. Lombards, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeſes, Catalonians, Spaniards,</hi> and others who uſed to buy the greateſt part of the Wools, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them from thence whither they would, out of the Land of <hi>Flanders</hi> by Land and Sea at their Pleaſures, to the great Profit and Encreaſe of the Price of Wools coming thither. The Towns of <hi>Bruges, Gant,</hi> and <hi>Ipre</hi> have lately ordained for their Profit, that no Wools coming to the <hi>Staple</hi> be ſold to Strangers, nor carried out of the ſaid Land of <hi>Flanders,</hi> as they uſed to be. To the Damage of the <hi>Merchants of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and of all the <hi>Commons</hi> whereof they pray Remedy.</q>
            <p>Anſw.</p>
            <q>As to the 5th Article it is agreed by the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> of the Realm, that the Petition is reaſonable. And moreover it is aſſented that every <hi>Merchant,</hi> as well <hi>Stranger</hi> as <hi>Privy,</hi> may buy <hi>Wools</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> as they uſed to do. And of this, let there be Writs made to the Sheriffs to make Proclamation thereof.</q>
            <p>Upon which it is obſervable;</p>
            <p>1<hi>ſt.</hi> That the <hi>King</hi>'s Power of erecting <hi>Staples</hi> is allowed, and the <hi>Staple</hi> of his erecting is continued by this Statute: For though leave is given to buy <hi>Wools</hi>any where in <hi>England; Bruges</hi> ſtill remained
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:109752:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the <hi>Foreign Staple,</hi> to which all Wools that were exported were to be conveyed.</p>
            <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> That this being only a Liberty to buy <hi>Wools</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> does not in the leaſt imply a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for <hi>Merchants</hi> to paſs abroad with their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes where it ſhall pleaſe them: for that would be wholly to deſtroy the <hi>Foreign Staple,</hi> which is by no means taken away: Wherefore if either the Writ to the Sheriff, or the Proclamation thereupon, miſtake the Liberty there mentioned, which Merchants formerly had, to paſs by Land and Sea from <hi>Flanders,</hi> as if it related to paſſing from <hi>England,</hi> and that through the Inadvertency of the Compiler of the Statute-Book, be foiſted in for the Act of Parliament, I am ſure it neither is, nor ought to be of any Avail.</p>
            <p>And 'tis further to be conſidered, that even that Liberty which is given by this Act to buy <hi>Wools</hi> any where in <hi>England,</hi> is reſtrained by the Statute of the <hi>Staple,</hi> nine Years after, which erects <hi>Staples</hi>
               <note place="margin">27 <hi>E.</hi> 3.</note> in ſeveral parts of <hi>England,</hi> to which all <hi>Wools,</hi> &amp;c. which ſhall be carried out of this Realm ſhall be brought. Nor are they according to that, to be exported by <hi>Merchants Denizens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor do the Statutes 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. &amp; 2 <hi>R.</hi> 2. which provide that <hi>Merchants</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>Aliens,</hi> and <hi>Denizens</hi> may buy and ſell all things vendible, of and to whom they will; amount to a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Liberty for <hi>Foreign Trade.</hi> For,</p>

               <hi>Act for Encouragement of Trade,</hi> 15 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. and ſome others of the like Nature. In that there is a Liberty given for exporting Corn or Grain when at certain <hi>Prizes, into any Places beyond the Seas as Merchandize.</hi> But 1. This being for <hi>Merchandize,</hi> can reach to no other places beſides thoſe whoſe Trade is lawful. And as no Man can ſay that by this Act they may ſend this to an Enemies Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; neither, if the King may by Law prohibit ſending to any other, may it be ſent thither. Wherefore the publick Prohibition excepted in <hi>Magna Charta</hi> muſt needs run through this Act. 2.

               <note place="margin">Second Charge of Power over Life.</note> The Power over Life exerciſed under the King's Authority, is of greater ſound, but not of any higher Nature, than the foregoing: For according to the Degrees of Power over Property, ſo it muſt by Conſequence be over <hi>Perſons:</hi> And it will be no harſh Suppoſal, that if the King is not tied to the Rules of <hi>Common Law</hi> in Relation to <hi>Foreign Trade;</hi> neither is he as to the <hi>Perſons</hi> of ſuch <hi>Traders.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>If the Powers of the <hi>Charter</hi> were duly purſued, then the only Queſtion will be, whether the <hi>King</hi> may give a Power to judg upon the Place, ſuch as tranſgreſs the Laws either of <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>by-Laws</hi> made for that Place?

            <p>If the Powers in the <hi>Charter</hi> have not been duly purſued, that will be the Fault of the <hi>Governor</hi> entruſted with the Execution of them, but not of the <hi>Company,</hi> unleſs it appear that they have given ſuch Inſtructions, which neither did nor could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, in their Caſe who were tried by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour at St. <hi>Helena:</hi> It being immediately upon their Rebellion, before there could come any Orders from hence concerning them.</p>
            <p>The heavieſt part of the Charge, is, that of a Commiſſion for <hi>Martial Law;</hi> which 'tis ſuppoſed that the <hi>Company</hi> obtained; &amp; that ſome of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee gave Inſtructions to have it put in Execution.</p>
            <p>For this 'tis requiſite to give a ſhort Account of the Inducements to that Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>The People of St. <hi>Helena</hi> having riſen to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency on a ſuddain, from the Grant of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, had grown inſolent with their good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and impatient of any Government; and four times rebell'd againſt the <hi>King's Auhtority</hi> admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred by the <hi>Governours</hi> there, meerly for Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions ſake, before they had any manner of Charge laid upon them for Maintenance of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: being only required to defend it with their
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:109752:14"/>
Bodies, and ſuch Arms as were given them by the Company; for which end they were bound to keep Guard in their turns, as well as to riſe in general upon occaſion: They having taken a Diſtaſte at the Deputy-Governor, upon the falſe Suggeſtions of the moſt Seditious among them, came down to the Fort in an hoſtile manner, demanding the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-Governor to be delivered up to their Fury; and it being refus'd, endeavour'd to force open the Gate.</p>
            <p>Some would juſtify their Recourſe to Arms, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Company</hi> finding more need of Defence againſt them than againſt Invaders, had been obliged to ſend Souldiers for ſecuring the Peace; and diſcharging them from their ordinary Attendance, had required the Payment of one Shilling <hi>per</hi> Acre for this neceſſary Support of the Government. Whereas 1. There was no Stipulation with them that they ſhould have any Vote or Intereſt, in the making any Laws or Proviſions about the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: However, 2. This which they would make a juſt occaſion, was not done till it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated by this very Rebellion, which thus they would ligitimate by way of Prophecy.</p>
            <p>The Rebels (for ſuch they were againſt the King's Power adminiſtred there) being diſperſed by the <hi>Company's</hi> Souldiers, ſome of them were taken and tried, and if the Witneſs produced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Company,</hi> ſwore true, they were not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding found guilty but of a Riot or Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult.

            <p>But did not the Common and Statute Law of the Land, the Civil Law of the Romans, or other Maritime or Marſhal Laws, afford ſufficient Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for an Apology, we might have Recourſe to the Foundation of them all, and what upon Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies ſuperſeeds all, the <hi>Salus Populi:</hi> To which the Intereſt both of Prince and People muſt give way; whenever there is a Competition.</p>
            <p>It is neceſſary that this ſhould be preſerved: And the Law of Neceſſity is ever held ſuperior to Forms and Proviſions for common Caſes.

That an <hi>Eaſt-India Company</hi> is for the Good of the Nation, is now paſt Controverſy, and is not only admitted on all ſides; but they who would deſtroy this, would be of a new one, that themſelves might ſhare in the Spoils of the Old. If therefore

the deſtroying this, the taking from its Credit, or leſſening the Powers which it has; though the like Powers ſhould immediately be veſted in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; may indanger the Loſs of Trade, or Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt in <hi>India;</hi> then 'tis certain 'twill be more expedient that the old Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſhould have a Supply of ſuch Powers as are ſuppoſed not to be Legal, than that it ſhould be leſſened in any Reſpect.</p>

            <p>Nay whatever tends to the ſinking its Credit, not only makes the Trade with the <hi>Indians</hi> to be upon more diſadvantageous terms, but gives ſuch an over-Ballance of Credit to our too powerful Competitors, as perhaps may not be retrieved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in ſome Ages. The denying the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company that Power, which is exerciſed there by others, would deprive it of means neceſſary to its Preſervation. It being impoſſible that a People at ſuch Diſtance can receive Laws from hence for all Emergencies, timely enough to obviate their Deſigns, who act by full Power upon the Place. And the very transferring this Power to another Company, but newly entred upon the Methods of advancing its Intereſt in the <hi>Indies,</hi> may occaſion the hazarding that publick Benefit, which the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is now in Poſſeſſion of.
