            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>We Declare and Proclaim, That we have obtained now
ſtrength of the Lord, and do as One Nan reſolve (by his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Help) one theſe Particulars.</p>
            <p>1. Liberty of Conſcince; but not of Sin.</p>
            <p>2. Gods Lawes to be Enthroned; but not the Jewes.</p>
            <p>3. Judges to be choſen in every City; but not impoſed.</p>
            <p>4. Taxes and Exciſe to be taken off, and never more lay'd
on.</p>
            <p>5. Free Trade for all Victuals, Ammunition and materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
inported, &amp; for all Manufactures exported.</p>
            <p>6. To indeavour a maintenance for Souldiers that have
been for the Good Old Cauſe, without Taxes or Oppreſſion
of the People.</p>
            <p>7. To indeavour all the Poor may be imployed and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97571:3"/>
without injury to any mans Propriety.</p>
            <p>8. Priſon Doors to be ſet open, to let out Debtors to
labour toward the payment of their Debts.</p>
            <p>9. And for preventing Royaliſts and Malignants from ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in Parliament to diſpoſe of the Eſtates, Lives and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of thoſe whoſe Vaſſels they ought to be by Conqueſt,
and ſo revenge by Councils what they loſt in Warr, the
qualifications were thought fit for the Election of either
new ſupplies, or new Parliaments.</p>
            <p>10. A Parliament or ſupply to be called from all Parts
of the three Nations for the better ſettling of this intended
Good.</p>
            <p>11. Elections not to be by a confuſed Rabble, nor yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
by a more Corrupt Sheriff; but to be choſen, or at
leaſt approved by the ſeveral Congregations for places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid.</p>
            <p>12. Such Parliament men to be maintained by the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
reſpective places they are choſen for, and to bring with
them the Atteſtation of the ſaid Election, under the Hands
and Seals of the reſpective Congregations at large, certify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alſo their Imployment, Converſation, and time of abode
amongſt them.</p>
            <p>13. That each Congregation have liberty to demand an
Account of the ſeveral Repreſentatives; And upon their
not diſcharging the Truſt, to redemand them, and to chuſe
others.</p>
            <p>14. That neither the Army, nor any Officer of the Army
ſhall have to do with Judicature, after the ſettling of the
Laws of God throughout the Nations, ſo long as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
Members of the Army.</p>
            <p>15. Becauſe that Mercy is better than Sacrifice; and to
ſave Life more then to deſtroy it: Therefore an Act of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion
for all men that may be pardoned, without leaving
the Guilt of Sin upon the Nation, or doing injury to any
difference between man and man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:97571:4"/>
16. That there may be ſufficient Proviſion for a godly
Miniſtery throughout all three Nations, upon ſuch Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as may ſatisfie each Religious Conſcience without
wounding the Liberty of any.</p>
            <p>17. That there may be an honourable entertainment for
above 1000 Lawyers or Judges, if ſo many honeſt may be
found, with ſufficient Clarks and Regiſters under them.</p>
            <p>Since this was gathered, as the intent &amp; meaning of ſome
old Souldiers and Officers, together with the mind of ſome
godly people of the Nation; It hath pleaſed God to haſten
the Reſurrection of that Parliament, that firſt modelized
theſe Kingdoms into a Common-wealth: to whoſe grave
conſultations, as to all others that deſire the good of this
Reipublick, and the eſtabliſhment thereof, upon ſolid and
unalterable foundation; this lies open without interrupting
either publick Councils, or private affairs; wherein theſe 3
difficulties chiefly appear. 1. To pay the Souldier. 2. To take
off Taxes. 3. To quicken Trade; For it were great Ingratitude
to let the good old Souldier periſh for want of pay, who
hath ſtood in the breach, and born the heat of the day.</p>
            <p>It were Tiranny and Oppreſſion ſtill to burthen the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
People with Aſſeſſements, Taxes, and Exciſe, who have
ſpent themſelves to Poverty and ruin for the Good Old
Cauſe.</p>
            <p>It were deſtructive to the Nation, &amp; would expoſe us na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to the mercy of Forreigners, not to encourage Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
and Sea-men.</p>
            <p>All which, having been the long meditations of ſome able
and well-meaning men, and God having anſwered their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
deſires, and Petitions in this behalf: ſo as to ſhew
them a very probable way, not onely for the maintaining of
the Good Old Officers and Souldiers, but of their Families
alſo without Aſſeſſements, Exciſe, or other Taxes on the
people, Together with the maintenance of the Navie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Cuſtomes on Ammunition, Victual, on materials im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
or any Manufactures, exported, or without invading
any mans propriety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:97571:4"/>
They look upon this juncture of time as the Voice of
God calling upon them, and giving them opportunity to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
ſo good a work. Nevertheleſs deſirous to be aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in ſo great an Enterprize, by as many perſons of note &amp;
ability as God hath made willing and able, together with
themſelves to put in ſufficient ſecurity for performance
hereof; they are intreated to ſend in their names to <hi>Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
Chapman,</hi> Book-Seller in Popes-head-Ally by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
who hath promiſed to keep them ſecret, till by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and freequent meetings the matter may be digeſted, fit
to be preſented to the Parliament and chief Officers of the
Army. Where if the Propoſitions prove acceptable, there
will be a ſumme of 500000 l. ready towards performance of
the ſame.</p>
            <p>This Paper having found favour in the eyes of ſome wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyes
of the Parliament, Army, and the City. It is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of thoſe in <hi>London</hi> (who are willing to engage their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
in the undertakings, when all difficulties are remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
That they likewiſe in the Countries, whom God hath
made able men of Eſtates, and of a willing mind thereto,
might alſo ſend in their Names, that ſo there may be a full
meeting to adviſe, both how to perform theſe great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
to the Nation, and how to obtain the favour and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Parliament and Army herein.</p>
            <p>There being very great encouragements and Probabilities
to anſwer all Objections, and overcome all Difficulties that
may ſeem at firſt ſight to appear therein,</p>
