            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

though lying at the <hi>gate,</hi> in the passage
and view of all; or if taken notice of, yet
so as not to be relieved; naked, so as not to
have wherewith to cover his Body, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
his <hi>sores</hi> from the cold, and that found
more pity among the <hi>dogs</hi> than men, while
alive (for they <hi>came and licked his sores);</hi> and
when dead through want, pain and anguish,
found as little charity to bury him. Thus far
we find them as unlike as can be in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
condition.</p>
            <p>But now let us follow them beyond the
Grave, and see what becomes of them in the
other world. There we find the poor <hi>Lazarus,</hi>
that once pitiful, contemptible, necessitous
wretched Creature, that wanted what the dogs
had here,<note place="margin">Mat. 15. 27.</note> the <hi>crumbs of the Table,</hi> taken care of
at his death by the Holy Angels, and <hi>carried</hi>
by them into a place of safety and rest, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and happiness, where <hi>Abraham</hi> was, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107012:3"/>
there preferr'd to a place of honour and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
for he lay <hi>in Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Bosom,</hi> having no
poverty, nor sores, nor contempt, nor any of
the <hi>evil things</hi> he received in his Life-time here.</p>
            <p>This he had because of his afflictions that he
endured, and bore with admirable patience;
because of his steady dependance upon God,
and an humble submission to him in the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
condition.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the Rich man when he
died went to Hell, where he had none of the
Ease and Luxury, the Respect and Honour,
none of the good things he received in his
life-time, but was <hi>tormented in a flame,</hi> wanting
<hi>water</hi> there as much to <hi>cool his tongue,</hi> and quench
his insatiable thirst, as <hi>Lazarus</hi> did before the
<hi>crumbs which fell from his Table</hi> to satisfy his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
There he was, and there he was to abide,
for there was <hi>a great Gulph fixed,</hi> that rendred him
as uncapable of receiving relief in the other
world, as he was neglectful and unwilling to
give it to such as needed in this.</p>
            <p>This he had for his Pride and Unmercifulness,
for his Contempt of God, and of others better
than himself. This he was too late sensible of
as to himself; <hi>he lift up his eyes,</hi> but he was <hi>in
torments;</hi> he cried to his <hi>Father Abraham,</hi> but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107012:4"/>
he proves inexorable; he calls for mercy, but
is minded of his former ingratitude to God,
and his uncharitableness to others, and is put to
silence with a <hi>Son remember, that thou in thy life-time
receivedst thy good things,</hi> ver. 25.</p>
            <p>When he could not prevail for himself, he
then turns his thoughts towards his <hi>Five brethren,</hi>
whom he left behind, that were as careless,
and so likely at last to be as miserable as
himself, and intreats <hi>Abraham</hi> that <hi>Lazarus</hi>
might be sent <hi>to testify unto them,</hi> how it
was with him, and how it would also be with
them unless they repented, <hi>ver. 27.</hi> To which
<hi>Abraham</hi> replies, <hi>ver. 29. They have Moses and the
Prophets, let them hear them.</hi> But that doth not
satisfy him, and he urges further: <hi>Nay, Father
Abraham, but if one went from the dead, they will
repent, ver. 30.</hi> This he speaks from his own
Experience, who had <hi>Moses and the Prophets</hi>
as well as they, and yet he was as secure and
careless, as if he had never heard or knew
what they Taught; and therefore unless some
other Expedient be thought of, or some other
means used, they are like in the conclusion
to be as miserable as himself; and surely that,
if any, would prevent it, <hi>if one went from the
dead.</hi> But to this <hi>Abraham</hi> replies in the Text,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107012:4"/>
               <hi>If they hear not Moses and the Prophets, neither will
they be persuaded, though one rise from the dead;</hi> that
is, if they give no Credit nor regard to what
is contained in their Writings concerning a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
State of rewards and punishments, they
are incurable, neither <hi>will they be persuaded</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
(as it is <hi>ver. 30.) though one rise from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That there is a Future State of Happiness or
Misery, in which the Souls of men do live after
a separation from their Bodies, has been in all
Ages universally received; But yet was not so
convincingly to be proved from the sole light
of <hi>Reason,</hi> but that a fuller evidence of it was
very desirable: For which there are but two
ways, Either that of Divine Revelation, by
persons Divinely Inspired; Or by the return of
one from the Dead, who was before known
to the Living. And these are the ways taken
here into consideration by our Saviour, in the
case before us: Where there may be three sorts
of persons concerned.</p>
            <p>1. Those that had not <hi>Moses</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and were wholly without a Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
as was the case of the Heathens: And
<hi>how shall they believe, who have not heard?</hi> Rom.
10. 14.</p>
            <p>2. Those that had <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107012:5"/>
and yet were incredulous, and did not believe
what <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets relate concerning a
Future State. Such were the <hi>Sadducees, who held
there was no resurrection,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 22. 23.</note> 
               <hi>angel, nor spirit</hi> exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of a Body.<note place="margin">Acts 23. 8.</note>
            </p>
            <p>3. Those that had <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets,
and did believe what was therein revealed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Soul's Immortality and a Future
Life, but were not thereby persuaded to repent.
Such were the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who professed to believe
what the <hi>Sadducees</hi> denied: And of this sort were
the Rich man (here spoken of) and his Five
Brethren supposed to be.</p>
            <p>Now toward the conviction of each of these,
it might be supposed, that if one rose from the
dead, the former would be persuaded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and the latter to repent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus the Heathens reasoned, who had no
Revelation. As that Excellent person</hi> Canus
Julus <hi>(that</hi> Seneca <hi>speaks of) who just before his
Execution said to his Friends,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Vos quaeritis an Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tales animae sint. Ego jam sciam.</note> Ye
are inquisitive to know whether the
Souls are Immortal; I shall now know.
<hi>And he promised,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Si quid Explorasset, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumiturum amicos, &amp; indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turum, qui esset animarum status. De Tranquil. c. 14.</note> If he found it
so, that he would go about among his
Friends, and would inform themwhat
was the state of departed Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:107012:5"/>
And the same <hi>Seneca,</hi> when discoursing to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilius</hi>
about the behaviour of <hi>Bassus Aufidius,</hi>
how dying he spake of Death as a Friend, and
what a confirmation this gave to the Doctrine
of the Souls Immortality, he
adds,<note n="*" place="margin">Plus ut puto haberet fidei apud to, si quis revixisset, &amp; in morte nihil mali esse narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret Expertus. <hi>Epist. 30.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>But I suppose you would more
firmly believe it, if one should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to life again, and should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that he found no evil in death.</hi>
To this they gladly repaired as an evidence
where they found it. And therefore <hi>Plato</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
the instance of <hi>Erus Armenius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Rep. l. 10.</note> that after
he had been dead Twelve days, revived, and
gave much such an account of the other State, as
we have in this Parable.</p>
            <p>But 'tis the case of Revelation we Christians
are more immediately concerned in, and which
our Saviour here speaks to, and prefers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Testimony of one rising from the
dead.</p>
            <p>The way here proposed concerning the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of one from the dead, has somewhat of
common Experience on its side. For we see
that notwithstanding the clear Revelation of
another state in Scripture, and the belief that
men have of it, yet generally they are but
little affected with these Arguments, though al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107012:6"/>
to be of the greatest importance, because
they lie dead in a Book, and are proposed to
them by such as have no more personal Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of these things than themselves, having
never been out of this world, nor had any
sight of, or conversation with the other.</p>
            <p>But now if a special Messenger should be
sent from the other world; a <hi>Lazarus</hi> who
was known to them when alive, and known by
them to be dead; one that had been an ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
witness of the things he spoke of and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
and should tell them, that as there
is a state of Happiness for good men, so
a state of Misery for the wicked, a state
of Misery without ease, respit, or hope of
deliverance, and confirmed all by his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
surely this would move them: Surely no
heart so hard, but this must penetrate; no mind
so stup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, but this must awaken; no Sinner so
incorrigible, but this must reclaim. And it
may be left to every one to judge, Whether
if there were such an Apparition that should
come upon this terrible Errand, any one could
see and hear it with the same calmness and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference,
as he hears a Sermon, or reads a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the Bible upon this serious Argument.</p>
            <p>So that the advantage seems to be much on
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107012:6"/>
the side of the Apparition; and the Proposal
here made, agreeable to the Common sense of
Mankind.</p>
            <p>But how probable a course soever this seems
to be, yet our Saviour here determines on the
contrary, <hi>If they hear not Moses and the Prophets,
neither,</hi> &amp;c. Which Answer may be resolved into
these Two parts.</p>
            <p>1. That the Arguments contained in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
are sufficient to persuade men to repent.</p>
            <p>2. When men disregard the Holy Scriptures,
(the ordinary means of Salvation) so as not
to be persuaded to repent by the Arguments
therein contained, they will not be persuaded
by means extraordinary, and <hi>though,</hi> for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<hi>one should rise from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The first of these,</hi> viz. That the Arguments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
<hi>&amp;c. is supposed,</hi> ver. 29. <hi>when</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
<hi>saith,</hi> they have Moses and the Prophets, let
them hear them: <hi>And this the other doth not
deny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the chief Arguments relating to this
Subject are briefly touched upon in this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
which are these:</p>
            <p>1. That the Souls of men are Immortal,
This is implied when the Rich man and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi>
are said to be in Being after they were
dead, <hi>ver. 22.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:107012:7"/>
2. That the state into which the Souls of
men are disposed after death, is a state of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence,
<hi>Abraham</hi> saith, <hi>ver. 25. He is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,
and thou art tormented.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>That that state of recompence is a state
of unchangeable happiness to some, and of
endless misery to others,</hi> ver. 26. Between us
and you there is a great gulph fixed, so that they
which would pass from hence to you <hi>[to relieve you],</hi>
cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come
from thence <hi>[for relief].</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>That men are disposed to happiness or
misery there, according to their behaviour in
this world,</hi> ver. 25. <hi>saith</hi> Abraham, Son, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that thou in thy life-time receivedst thy good
things, and likewise Lazarus evil things, but now he
is comforted, and thou art tormented.</p>
            <p>These are Considerations of such force and
consequence, that this miserable person desires
not that <hi>Lazarus</hi> should be sent to argue upon
them with his Five Brethren, but to <hi>testify</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
their reality.</p>
            <p>Arguments they are of such force, that he
that will not by these be persuaded to repent,
will never be persuaded by any other. But
though this be all granted to be true (as it's
supposed), yet in his opinion, as the case would
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107012:7"/>
admit further evidence, so it seemed to need
it; and therefore if this extraordinary course
were taken of sending one from the dead, <hi>they
would</hi> (in his opinion) certainly <hi>repent,</hi> who with
the ordinary means continue impenitent.</p>
            <p>This brings to the 2d General.</p>
            <p>2. When men disregard the ordinary means
of Salvation, and are not to be persuaded to
repent by the Arguments revealed in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
they will not be persuaded by means ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
and though one should come from
the dead to persuade them.</p>
            <p>For the resolving of which point, we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what are the reasons why the ordinary
means of Salvation, such as the holy Scriptures
are, prove ineffectual; which cannot be from the
want of proper and forcible Arguments; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
one from the dead can say to move or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade,
is as plainly deliver'd in Scripture. He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
more expresly tell them that there is a God,
that the Souls of men are Immortal, that there is a
Heaven and a Hell, than the Scripture doth.
And therefore if what is thus revealed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
upon such Revelation, should not prove
as effectual, as what is reported by a special
Messenger from the dead; it must be from
some reasons which belong to the one, and not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107012:8"/>
to the other; but that there is no ground for; and
therefore from whence can this proceed, but from
the excessive love to the things of this Life, and
the indulgence men give to themselves in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments
of it? Whence should this proceed
but from the power of those Lusts and Vicious
Habits they have contracted?</p>
            <p>And where these and the like causes are, a
Messenger from the other world will make no
stronger an impression, nor will an impression
thereby made, be of any longer continuance,
than in the other case: But that he that will
not be persuaded by <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets,
will not be persuaded though one come from
the dead.</p>
            <p>And this I shall make good,</p>
            <p>1. By parallel and sutable cases and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>
            <p>2 By a particular inquiry into the causes of
impenitence, which will hold in one case as
well as the other.</p>
            <p>1. By parallel cases.</p>
            <p>As,</p>
            <p>(1.) If means as extraordinary, and more
extraordinary than the coming of one from the
dead, have failed in this point, and not persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
men to repentance, we have as little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107012:8"/>
to expect, nor can it reasonably be presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
that the coming of one from the dead,
should persuade and become effectual.</p>
            <p>As for instance; Let us consider the case
of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> before whom such stupendious Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
were wrought, and upon whom such
astonishing Judgments were inflicted, as could
not in reason be supposed resistible: When the
Waters, Earth, and Air, Beasts, Fishes, and
Fruits of the Earth, Men and Children, either
felt or were made the instruments of Divine
Vengeance. Could it be thought that when the
Waters were turned into Blood, and Frogs co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the face of the Earth, and the Dust of it
was converted into Lice, and the plague of
Flies followed that of Lice; and Murrain, Flies;
and Boils, the Murrain; and Hail, Boils; and
Locusts, Hail; and Darkness Locusts; and the
killing of the First-born, the Darkness; that he
should yet be so obstinate as not to let the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Israel</hi> go; and when he did, should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them into the midst of the Sea? Could
disappointment, vexation, and revenge, so far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuate
him, that Miracle after Miracle, Scourge
upon Scourge, could not persuade him, nor the
sense of so imminent a danger stop him in his
carier, but that he persisted in his first resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107012:9"/>
and blinded thus with rage, pursued it to
his destruction?<note place="margin">Exod. 7. 8, 9, 10.</note> Can it be supposed now, that
one from the dead could more have prevailed
upon him than this Scene of Judgments? Could
it have come with so much terror? Or if it
should, may not the Sinner be alike obstinate
and infatuated? May not the like passions and
sensual affections, or a habit of Sin, keep a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
from hearkening to, or following the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of one come from the dead?</p>
            <p>Let us consider again, how it was with the
<hi>Israelites,</hi> who had not only been Spectators of
those Miracles and Judgments in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but
stood safe in the midst of them;<note place="margin">Deut. 1. 32.</note> that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
<note place="margin">Psal. 78. 22. 32. 56. 106. 24.</note> directed, and fed by a continued Series
of Miracles, and yet were not only upon every
occasion tempting and provoking God by their
distrust,<note place="margin">Nehem. 9. 16.</note> impatience and murmuring, but were
for returning into <hi>Egypt</hi> again.</p>
            <p>Thus it was also with their Posterity in our
Saviour's time, who notwithstanding the plain
fulfilling of their ancient Prophesies in him,
notwithstanding the Innocency of his Life, the
Purity, Sanctity, and Evidence of his Doctrine,
the Power of his Miracles, changing the course
of Nature as he pleased; healing the Sick, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Eyes of such as were born blind, cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107012:9"/>
out Devils, and raising the Dead. Nay,
notwithstanding his Resurrection, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable
confirmation of it, yet continued
obstinate and incredulous,<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 13.</note> and what they could
not deny, would impute to <hi>Beelzebub.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now what comparison is there between the
coming of one from the dead, and this case? Or
what reason is there to conceive that a wicked
<hi>Jew</hi> should have been more effectually reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from a Vicious course of Life, and be made
a penitent by the coming of one from the dead,
than the <hi>Jewish</hi> Infidel should be made a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
by all those numerous Miracles, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Christian? And why may not the one
be as well impenitent, as the other an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del?</p>
            <p>2. It may be supposed in reason, that what
a person hears from another, should in a matter
of importance alike affect him in one case as
in another: And if he is not persuaded by the
one, there is no reason to expect he should be
prevailed upon by the other.</p>
            <p>Such indeed is the Testimony of one rising
from the dead, who must be acknowledged to
be a very fit Evidence concerning the reality of
a Future State, and the condition of Separate
Souls in it, as he has been personally
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107012:10"/>
acquainted with it, and had a part in it.</p>
            <p>But such also is the Testimony of a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
Sinner, that after a vicious course of Life,
entring upon the confines of death, and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every moment to be snatched away by that
inexorable Enemy, feels now the anguish no
less than he formerly relished the pleasures of
his Sin; that cries out in the bitterness of his
Soul, That he is sensible, but he fears too late,
of his former folly: That he is now prey'd
upon by a Thousand Vipers, and feels a Hell in
himself before he descends into it.</p>
            <p>And in this Agony calls upon all about him,
and the once Sworn Companions in his Vices, to
take warning by him, and no longer to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
themselves with the charms of those noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
pleasures he is now burdened with the guilt
of, and would not for a world repeat, if he was
to live his Life over again.</p>
            <p>Is not here a living and present Testimony?
And if one should come from the dead, can
he say more, or can his Testimony be of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
force concerning the State he comes from,
than this of the awakened penitent, if not
despairing Sinner, is, concerning the Evil, the
Guilt, and Terror of Sin?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:107012:10"/>
And yet if this be not attended to, or the
force of it be soon carried off by a Glass of
Wine, and the charms of Company and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,
or tract of Time; Can it be supposed
that the same Event may not happen to the
other? And will not the hardned and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Sinner as much despise, or as soon forget the
admonitions of this ghostly Monitor, as those
of a dying desponding Friend?</p>
            <p>3. It may be expected that what a person
sees himself, should more affect him, than what
he hears only by the report of others. And
if what he sees, (though in a matter of necessity
and importance) makes little or no impression
upon him; how can it be supposed, that what
he hears only from another should affect him?
And this is the case: For if one came from the
dead to bear witness to the truth of a Future
State of recompence, and of the misery of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent
Souls in it, it's only testimony and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
and what can neither be of that certainty
nor force, as if the person to whom he comes
upon this errand, had himself been in that
State.</p>
            <p>But now there are those things which a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
sees, and which should in reason, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the nature of the things, as much move
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107012:11"/>
him, as the Testimony of one coming from the
dead.</p>
            <p>And of this kind is Death, which we every
day have in view, and are no more secured
against the very next moment, than those that
are already departed.</p>
            <p>The plain consequence of which is this, That
'tis then our greatest wisdom so to order our
selves and all our affairs, that we may meet it
withour surprize or terror, and may live as we
would wish we had done, when that fatal hour
doth approach.</p>
            <p>And yet if we take a view of Mankind, we
find them generally as secure, as if they alone
were immortal; or as improvident, as if they
had death under such an obligation, that it
must give them time and leisure sufficient to
put all things in order, before it shall proceed
to executeits Sentence.</p>
            <p>Now if in a matter so apparent, sensible, and
certain, there is so little, where there ought to
be the greatest concernment, and Mankind is
so difficultly moved, that they either don't con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
or the consideration of it makes them no
wiser or better; what reason is there to imagine,
that the testimony of another, though it be one
from the dead, should make any lasting im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107012:11"/>
upon them, and persuade them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent?</p>
            <p>4. What a person feels himself, should in
reason more affect him, than what he hears or
sees of others.</p>
            <p>And if what he himself feels makes little or
no impression upon him, 'tis not to be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that what he only sees or hears should
move him.</p>
            <p>In confirmation of which, we may reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the common state and behaviour of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
in the Judgments and Afflictions that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal
them, the Dangers they are in, the Terrors
they are under. In which and the like cases, we
shall find them too often insensible and incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,
or inconstant and unresolved.</p>
            <p>Sometimes they are insensible under the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
Judgments: As it was with <hi>Ahaz,</hi> who for
his Idolatry was delivered up to his Enemies;
On the East, the King of <hi>Assyria;</hi> on the North,
the King of <hi>Israel;</hi> on the South, the <hi>Edomite;</hi> on
the West, the <hi>Philistines,</hi> invade and spoil his
Territories; as we have it, <hi>2 Chron. 28. 5, 6,
17, 18.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet when brought thus low for his
Transgressions, it's said of him, <hi>In the time of his
distress he trespassed yet more against the Lord,</hi> ver. 22.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:107012:12"/>
               <hi>At other times, if sensible, yet they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant,
and in the event prove incorrigible.
As it was with the</hi> Israelites, <hi>Psal. 78. 34,</hi> &amp;c.
When he slew them, then they sought him, and enquired
early after God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nevertheless they did flatter
him with their mouth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For their heart was not
right with God, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.</p>
            <p>Now can it be supposed that an Apparition
of one from the dead should do more than
these; and that He should by that be disposed
to repent, whom the severest Judgments left
impenitent?</p>
            <p>Or suppose the Sinner terrified hereby, and
melted into an affectionate temper; yet have we
not examples of that kind every day, of persons
that after all the terrors they are under, are set no
nearer to a true repentance; and though they
seem for a while by some good resolutions to
make towards the Kingdom of Heaven, are
<hi>never able to enter,</hi> (as our Saviour expresses it)
<hi>Luk. 13. 24.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>View we then a Sinner under the power of
his convictions, in the time of danger and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress,
when he has no way to escape.</p>
            <p>How terrified has he been in his own mind at
the approaches of death! How Grave, Solemn
and Serious has it made him! How importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107012:12"/>
has he been for Mercy, and for some longer
time to finish his Repentance! What Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
Resolutions, and Vows has he made!
What Imprecations has he wished upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
if ever he should prove false to them;
and desired no mercy if ever he should break
them! Lord, will he say, <q>Spare me but
this once; try me but once more, and then
if I return to my former Sins, or neglect to
put my self into a capacity for thy favour
and mercy, let me never find it.</q> As it was
with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who said to <hi>Moses, Forgive my Sin
only this once, and intreat the Lord that he may take
away from me this death only,</hi> Exod. 10. 16.</p>
            <p>Now could the Apparition of one from the
dead do more than this? Can we suppose the
Sinner more terrified, more seriously concerned
and resolved, than when he had his own
Conscience thus impartially representing the
case to him, and Almighty God awakening
his Conscience by an extraordinary Providence?</p>
            <p>And now let us consider the event of this, and
whether after this tender disposition of mind, and
seeming resolution, he is a true Penitent; or that,
in the Phrase of the Text, <hi>he will repent,</hi> and
that this will necessarily be the issue of it.</p>
            <p>Suppose we then this Languishing person
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107012:13"/>
rescued out of the jaws of Death by a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
Providence, and put into the Condition
of making a second tryal, and of giving a
proof of his thankfulness to God, and of his
fidelity to his Sick-bed Vows and Resolutions.</p>
            <p>Let us suppose him again breathing in a free
Air, and having all the inticing Objects afresh
presented to him, that he was before conversant
with.</p>
            <p>Let us trace him along, and we shall find
him, as the terror and sense of his danger wears
off, first covertly looking, then remotely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
at last overtaking and closing with
the same temptations; and perhaps plunging
himself further into the same Licentious state
than before.</p>
            <p>Grant we now that there is a just reason for
the Sinner's terror, if the Ghost of his Decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Friend, and the once inseparable Partner in his
Vices, should appear, and plainly represent to
him the desert of Sin in the Miseries of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Life, and the certainty of his having a
Portion in them without repentance. Grant
we (and he must be a stone rather than a
man, whom it has no influence upon) that
he is brought by it into the state of <hi>Belshaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi>
Dan. 5. that his <hi>Countenance</hi> is <hi>changed,</hi> and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107012:13"/>
his <hi>Thoughts</hi> so <hi>trouble him,</hi> that the <hi>joints of his
Loins</hi> are <hi>unloosed,</hi> and his <hi>Knees smite one against
another.</hi> Yet still this may be, and he be no
true Penitent, nor this prove a means effectual
enough to reform him. For a man repents no
further than his Will and Temper is changed;
and if these remain the same, he no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
to whom the dead has appeared (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
terrors he may be under) than he that
was upon the borders of Death: And he may
and will as soon as he, upon occasion, repent
of his repentance. So certainly true is that
which was before observed, That the causes
which hinder men from being persuaded
to repentance by the Arguments of Scripture,
will also keep them from being persuaded by
means extraordinary, such as the coming of one
from the dead. And that the <hi>cares of this world,
and the deceitfulness of riches,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark 4. 19.</note> 
               <hi>and the lusts of other
things,</hi> will as well render the extraordinary
means ineffectual, as <hi>choke the Word</hi> of God, and
make it <hi>unfruitful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let God send all the Plagues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and
yet <hi>Pharaoh</hi> will harden his heart: Let the Sea
be divided, and <hi>Manna</hi> rained from Heaven,
and Water break out of the Rock, and the
Water of the Rock <hi>follow</hi> them for 40 years
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107012:14"/>
together.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 4.</note> Let them have a Cloud by Day,
and a Pillar of Fire by Night as their Guide,
and an Angel for their Safeguard, and yet the
<hi>Israelites</hi> will be tempting, provoking, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring.
Let one come <hi>and do the works which
never man did;</hi> give sight to the Blind; feet to
the Lame; health to the Sick; life to the
Dead. Let the Sun be darkned; the Rocks
rend; the Graves be opened, and the Dead
appear: Nay, let him that did all this, and
for whose sake it was done, rise again from the
Dead, and visibly ascend into Heaven; yet
the obstinate <hi>Jew</hi> will be incredulous. Let a
Ghost appear, and preach over the despised Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of the Soul's Immortality, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of a Future State, and of a Judgment to
come, and reinforce it from his own Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Experience, and verify all this by
his return from the Dead: And yet the Sinner,
the customary Sinner, is not to be reclaimed;
who <hi>like the deaf Adder stops his ears against the
voice of the charmer, charm he never</hi> so powerfully
and <hi>wisely,</hi> Psal. 58. 5.</p>
            <p>It's then all one whether it be <hi>Moses</hi> and
the Prophets, Christ and the Apostles, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
or the Resurrection of one from
the Dead, when the Temper is otherwise

inclined: And if the Honours, Profits, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
and Pleasures of the world do ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the one, they will also render the other
ineffectual. So true is that, <hi>Wisd. 4. 12.</hi> that
<hi>wickedness by bewitching, obscureth the things that are
good;</hi> and will disarm all Arguments can be
produced, of their Force and Efficacy.</p>
            <p>2. I might further prove this, by consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the reasons why Men don't believe and
repent, and the Excuses they make for delays
in it, which will as well frustrate the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
and Persuasions of one from the Dead,
as it doth the Arguments of Divine Revelation.</p>
            <p>(1.) The reasons have been partly shewed
already, and they are the prevalency of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Inclinations; the Presence of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
the Habits of Vice; or a Worldly Interest;
which are the usual Obstructions to Repentance,
and have a greater power over Men to detain
them in Sin, than all the Arguments of the
Gospel, and the Convictions of their own
Minds, have to reclaim them from it. We see
that though they have Line upon Line, the
most powerful Motives in the World, such
threatnings as make them at some times with
<hi>Foelix</hi> to tremble:<note place="margin">Acts 24. 25.</note> Such comfortable Doctrines
as make them at other times with <hi>Herod</hi> to <hi>hear
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:107012:15"/>
gladly:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark 6. 20.</note> Such moving and awakening conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
as bring them with <hi>Balaam</hi> to desire to
<hi>dye,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numb. 23. 10.</note> and further than him, to a desire to <hi>live</hi>
the life of the Righteous; yet they soon fail
of their force; and the <hi>Foelix</hi> was the <hi>Foelix</hi>
that left his Preacher <hi>Paul</hi> in bonds:<note place="margin">Acts 24. 27.</note> And
the <hi>Balaam</hi> was the <hi>Balaam</hi> that as well took, as he
<hi>loved,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numb. 31. 16.</note> 
               <hi>the wages of unrighteousness:</hi> And the <hi>Herod</hi>
was the <hi>Herod</hi> that beheaded <hi>John</hi> Baptist whom
he observed and heard with pleasure.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 15.</note>
            </p>
            <p>For all these Passions are like Qualms that
soon pass off, and prevail not so far as to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Temper. And where persons are thus
under the power of their Lusts, they will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in the same state, if one came from the
Dead to warn and reprove them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if <hi>John</hi> B. had rose from the Dead, as <hi>Herod</hi>
once imagined and believed,<note place="margin">Matt. 14. 2.</note> it would no more
have made him a true Penitent, than the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that Holy Man did, when alive; as long
as <hi>Herodias</hi> was by him to seduce him, and he
was contented to be seduced.</p>
            <p>(2.) The case is the same with persons in
delaying heir Repentance; and if the Excuse
against the present necessity of it prevail in one
case, they will also prevail in the other. So
that he that will not be persuaded to a present
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107012:15"/>
Repentance, by the Arguments of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
will not be persuaded by the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
and Admonition of one from the Dead.</p>
            <p>And upon the whole the Question is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a person may not reason the same way, and
as much to his own Delusion, against the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
and Persuasions of one from the Dead,
as against the Authority and Arguments of
Scripture, and at last be as far from Repentance
and a present Repentance?</p>
            <p>And whether there is not reason to conclude,
That if these and the like Excuses prove suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to detain men in impenitency notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all the Arguments to the contrary,
contained in Scripture; the same will not be of
as much force, and have as much influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Sinner, if one should come from the
Dead to admonish him?</p>
            <p>I am confident that this is not to be gainsaid.</p>
            <p>And so the Proposition before laid down re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
good, That the reasons for which persons
give no heed to, or are not persuaded by the
Authority and Arguments of Scripture, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and repent, will keep them from giving
heed to, and being persuaded by the coming of
one from the Dead.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:107012:16"/>
But this is a case I shall not further prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute;
for it needs Consideration, rather than
Proof.</p>
            <p>I shall therefore close all with Three or
Four Inferences.</p>
            <p>1. From hence I infer, That there is no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
need of any other course to be taken for
the Conviction and Conversion of Sinners,
than what is already taken; or that extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
means should be used, where the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
are sufficient.</p>
            <p>If there be a Revelation, which is believed
certainly to be Divine, and the Arguments
contained in that Revelation are sufficient to
persuade men to believe and repent, Then there
is no need of Miracles, nor of a Voice from
Heaven, nor the Resurrection of one from the
Dead. If there be impenitency with reason
and proof sufficient to convince and persuade
men, there will be impenitency still, with
such proof as is more than sufficient. <hi>These
things are written that ye might believe,</hi> Joh. 20. 30.
And consequently, what is Written, is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to persuade us to a belief of what is
Written.</p>
            <p>2. God is not bound to give, nor can men
in reason desire or expect, that he should use
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107012:16"/>
an extraordinary course where the ordinary is
sufficient; and that one should rise from the
Dead for their Conviction, who have <hi>Moses</hi>
and the Prophets, Christ and the Apostles. It
was the Temper of <hi>Thomas, Except I shall see in
his hands the print of the nails, and thrust my hand
into his side, I will not believe,</hi> Joh. 20. 25.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This was the Temper of the incredulous</hi>
Jews, Let him come down from the cross, and we will
believe, <hi>Matt. 27. 42. So</hi> Celsus <hi>the Heathen will
have it,</hi> If Christ were the Son of God, that he should
have been <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, like the Sun;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Origen,</hi> l. 2.</note> 
               <hi>and the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
person here would have</hi> one rise from the
dead.</p>
            <p>There will be no end if once we exceed the
ordinary bounds, and expect evidence beyond
what is sufficient: For then men may require
to be rapt up into Paradise,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 4.</note> as St. <hi>Paul</hi>
was;<note place="margin">Acts 7. 56.</note> or <hi>to see the heavens opened, and the Son of man
standing on the right hand of God,</hi> as did St. <hi>Stephen:</hi>
Nay,<note place="margin">John 14. 8.</note> they may be as impertinent as <hi>Philip,</hi> and
say, <hi>Shew us the Father, and it sufficeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. We are bound to believe what we have
sufficient evidence for; and to repent when
the Reasons and Motives to it are sufficient,
though we have not all the Evidence that may
be given, and that 'tis possible for God to give.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107012:17"/>
'Tis possible for God to send a <hi>Lazarus</hi> from
the Dead, to <hi>testify</hi> unto the impenitent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the certainty of <hi>a place of torment</hi> in
the other World.</p>
            <p>And 'tis possible, though not very probable,
(as I have shew'd) that may be a means to
awaken such, and bring Them to repentance,
whom the Doctrine of Divine Revelation, and
the Arguments of Scripture could not prevail
upon. But that doth not lessen the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of believing and doing according to Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
and which without such further evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is of it self sufficient for their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>4. Those that have the Evidence of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Revelation, and yet do not believe and
repent according to that Revelation, are wholly
inexcusable; <hi>They have Moses and the Prophets,</hi>
saith our Saviour, <hi>let them hear them;</hi> for that
was sufficient, and all that was necessary to bring
them to Repentance here, and Salvation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
And if they that had <hi>Moses</hi> and the
Prophets only, were inexcusable, what can
those plead, who have not only <hi>Moses</hi> and the
Prophets, but Christ and the Apostles, who have
brought <hi>life and immortality to light through the
Gospel?</hi> And who must therefore have so many
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107012:17"/>
more reasons against them, as there are more
for the confirmation of the Truth of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and for the conviction of Unbelievers,
than there were under the Law: And therefore
if any continue in a state of Unbelief and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence
under the Gospel, <hi>it will be more tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of Judgment</hi>
than for them. If such do perish, 'tis wholly
from themselves: If such do perish, 'tis not
through want of Information sufficient to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
them; not through want of Arguments
powerful enough to convince them; not
through want of Authority sufficient to oblige
them; not through want of sufficient Grace
to enable them; not through want of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in God, or Merit in a Saviour, or a Will,
Desire or Endeavour in both to save them, but
from themselves. And how just will then the
Sentence of Condemnation be to such! How
will all Pleas then be prevented! And how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
must his case be, that is Condemned by
himself before he is Condemned by God!</p>
            <p>To conclude,</p>
            <p>Here is Life and Death set before us, in
the most pressing Arguments; the most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Motives; the most persuasive invitations
to Repentance. We have here proposed to us
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:107012:18"/>
all that <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, Christ and the
Apostles have said to convince us: And we
have still, through the Merciful Providence of
God, means to assist us in it, and time and
opportunity for the performance of it. But
the time is coming, and will most certainly
come, when, if we have not before believed
and repented, Neither <hi>Moses</hi> nor the Prophets,
neither <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor one <hi>greater than Abraham,</hi>
will or can relieve us. And therefore how
necessary is it for all now to hearken to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
and the Prophets, to Christ and the Apostles,
in this their Day? For if they now hear them
not, they can no more hereafter be saved, than
they would have been <hi>persuaded though one had
rose from the dead.</hi>
