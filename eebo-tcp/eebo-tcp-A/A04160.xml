            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>For the Prophets of the old Teſtament, in ſome ages God raiſed up many, in ſome very few, in ſome none: From the time of <hi>Malachie</hi> untill Chriſt we have no writings nor knowledge of any, which was about 400. yeares at the leaſt. <note n="*" place="margin">

with judgements, comfort the godly, and make the wicked excuſeleſſe, who contemned God and his word; this being often and moſt heavily laid to their charge, that he did riſe up early and late, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all his Prophets, but they would not heare <note n="i" place="margin">Ier. 11. 7. 35. 15.</note>.</p>
            <p>Concerning our preſent Prophet, hee was an excellent man of God, ſanctified in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe, and abundantly furniſhed with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie graces and gifts of God: his name was <hi>Ieremie,</hi> about the <hi>Etymon</hi> whereof, the godly learned are ſomewhat divided in opinion; two of them are good, you may chuſe whether yee will: One deriveth his name from ſuch rootes in the Hebrew tongue, as ſignifie an excellent man of <note n="a" place="margin">Iirmijah.

            <p>But that which is preciſely regiſtred, and <note place="margin">The whole time betwixt the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of the ten Tribes, and of Iudah, was 130. yeares, towards the latter end whereof our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet was ſent, and ſo continued till the captivity. <hi>Joſep.

               <note n="x" place="margin">Eſay 58.</note>: Oh that is comfortable, that God is more ready to heare and helpe, than his people are to call upon him. But here God telleth the Prophet, he will not heare him; oh this is fearefull! As then <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> awaking out of his dreame, ſaid, <hi>How dreadfull is this place? this is none other, but the gate of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> 
               <note n="y" place="margin">Gen. 28. 17.</note>; ſo may I ſay, when I muſe upon theſe words, Oh how dreadfull is this text! this is none other, but the gate of deſtruction; Oh ſinne, oh ſinne, whither leadeſt thou? how vile and odious a thing art thou! that bindeſt Gods hands, that he cannot helpe; ſtoppeſt Gods eares, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not heare; ſhutteſt his eyes, that he cannot ſee; turneſt compaſſions into cruelties; ſmiling coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3489:12"/>
into frownes; promiſes, into threatnings; mercies, into judgements; and of a loving Father, makeſt an angry Iudge! Oh wofull, the condition of Gods people now! That it may not be yours, be ware of their ſins. And this is the maine marke I aime at, both in the choyce and handling of this Scripture; which that I may the more orderly and profitably doe, I will firſt give you the ſenſe of the words, and then raiſe the Doctrines, with their ſeverall Uſes and Applications: and becauſe they are many, and very uſefull, let me ſtand a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle longer, in the inlightning of this darke Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauſe upon the true underſtanding thereof, as on an immovable foundation, the enſuing Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines are raiſed and builded.</p>
            <p>The queſtion then is, whether this be an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <note place="margin">Senſe.</note> interdiction or no? whether God meant, as the words ſound, that indeed the Prophet muſt not pray for them? if he did, it were a ſinne of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience againſt Gods revealed will, or no?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, It was an abſolute prohibition, as the letters ſound, ſo as if hee had prayed for them, hee had ſinned; yet with this qualification, that he is forbidden to pray for them, that they may not be carried into captivitie. Their captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in Babylon was the burthen of his prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and againſt that he may not pray <note n="*" place="margin">Eſt ſpeciale in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdictum. Piſcat. in locum.</note>; as a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Divine ſaith on the place, hee might not pray for the ſtate of the kingdome <note n="“" place="margin">Non debuit pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtatu regni or are. Calv.</note>; hee might, and doubtleſſe did, pray for many bleſſings of God, yea for greater bleſſings than this was, or could be; hee might pray to God to give them
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3489:12"/>
knowledge, faith, repentance, remiſſion of ſinnes, redemption from eternall captivitie; he might pray to God, to give them comfort and patience in their captivitie, and to ſend them deliverance, according to promiſe; he might pray for delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from ſome other judgements, as famine, or peſtilence; but to pray for the ſtate of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that it might ſtand and flouriſh, and the enemie not prevaile, ſo he might not pray: God was reſolved, for their ſinnes, they ſhould goe into captivitie, as their brethren before them had done. That this is the true ſenſe, ſeemeth to mee ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently confirmed by theſe foure Reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, after this time, we doe not reade that ever <note place="margin">1. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Hee did not pray for them.</note> the Prophet did pray for them. It may be, ſome that are well acquainted with this propheſie, will ſay, I failed in memory, for he prayed, and prayed moſt earneſtly for them, ſaying, <hi>We acknowledge, ô Lord, our wickedneſſe, and the iniquitie of our fathers, for we have ſinned againſt thee, doe not abhorre us, for thy names ſake, doe not diſgrace the throne of thy glory, remember, and doe not breake thy covenant with us</hi> 
               <note n="z" place="margin">Ierem. 14. 20.</note>: Could there be a more powerfull and patheticall prayer made than this? I anſwer, that the very next words to that prayer, the laſt verſe of that chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, doth declare, that at that time there was a great famine, by reaſon of drought; and for remove of that judgement, and for the bleſſing of raine he prayed, ſaying, <hi>Is there any among the vanities of the Gentiles, that can cauſe raine? or can the Heavens give ſhowers? art not thou he, ô Lord our God? therefore we will wait upon thee.</hi> But (I ſay againe)
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3489:13"/>
he never prayed, that the people might not goe into captivitie, which proveth that this was an abſolute prohibition.</p>
            <p>Yea, for further fortification of this Reaſon, take notice, that he was ſo farre from praying for <note place="margin">Fortification.</note> their deliverance, that, occaſioned from the great wrongs they offered him, by the motion of Gods Spirit, he doth moſt fearefully imprecate them, <hi>Poure out their bloud by the force of the ſword, let their wives be bereaved of their children, and be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, let their men be put to death, and their young men ſlaine by ſword in battaile</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Ierem. 18. 21.</note>. And againe, <hi>Let me ſee thy vengeance upon them, for unto thee have I opened my cauſe</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Ierem. 20. 12.</note>. Thus humbly did the Prophet ſubſcribe to Gods revealed decree, and zealouſly pray for the execution of it, though moſt contrary to his naturall deſire: neither did ever any thing ſo much grieve and afflict him, as his Lamentations beare witneſſe.</p>
            <p>If any object, that herein the Prophet was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> in love:</p>
            <p>No, no, we muſt love one another, but it muſt <note place="margin">Sol.</note> be in God: <hi>Abraham</hi> muſt, but love his ſonne <hi>Iſaack</hi> in God: if God command him to take and ſacrifice him, he muſt riſe earely <note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 22.</note>, and go as chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully about that, as if he went to his marriage: <hi>Eli</hi> muſt not love himſelfe, nor his ſonnes, but in God, if hee crave ſuch a meſſage againſt him and his houſe, as whoſoever heareth it, would make his eares to tingle; <hi>It is the Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Eli) let him doe what ſeemeth him good</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">1 Sam. 3. 18.</note>: Hath not Chriſt taught us to pray, that Gods will may be done <note n="e" place="margin">Matth. 6.</note>? This

Prophet loved Gods people dearely; and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth unto God, <hi>Remember that I ſtood before thee, to ſpeake good for them, and to turne away thy wrath from them</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">Ierem. 18. 20. Gods will be done with us, and on us.</note>: but when God forbiddeth him to pray, he muſt either hold his peace, or pray for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of Gods judgements.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Prophet ever perſwaded the King, Princes, and people, without any reſiſtance <note place="margin">2. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Hee ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded them to yeeld.</note> to yeeld themſelves to the King of Babylon; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, behold I ſet before you the way of life, and way of death: he that abideth in the Citie ſhall die by the ſword, by famine, and by peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; but he that goeth out, and falleth to the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans that beſiege you, he ſhall live, and his life ſhall be unto him for a prey; for I have ſet my face against this Citie, for evill, and not for good, it ſhall be given into the hands of the King of Babylon, and he ſhall burne it with fire,</hi> ſaith the Lord <note n="g" place="margin">Ierem. 21. 9.</note>. The like he counſelled <hi>Zedekiah</hi> the King, <hi>Bring your necks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the yoke of the King of Babylon, and ſerve him and his people, and live; why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the ſword, by the famine, and by the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">Ierem. 27. 8. 12.</note>? And as he adviſed the King and people to yeeld themſelves; ſo he wrote a letter to thoſe that were carried away captives, requiring them in the name of the Lord to be quiet, and to pray to the Lord for the peace of the Citie <note n="i" place="margin">Ierem. 29. 7.</note>; which ſheweth, that <hi>Ieremie</hi> well knew that the Lords purpoſe was abſolute, and his prohibition to pray for them ſo too.</p>
            <p>If any man ſhall aske me, whether Gods threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings <note place="margin">Quest.</note> be not conditionall?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:3489:14"/>
I anſwer, that many of Gods threatnings of <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> temporall puniſhments are conditionall: ſo ſaith God by our Prophet, <hi>At what inſtant I ſhall ſpeake concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdome to plucke up, pull downe, and deſtroy it; if that nation againſt whom I have pronounced, turne from their evill, I will repent of the evill I have thought to doe unto them</hi> 
               <note n="k" place="margin">Ierem. 18. 7, 8.</note>. It was the caſe of Ninivie, againſt which <hi>Ionah,</hi> by commiſſion from the Lord, pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, <hi>Yet fortie dayes, and Ninivie ſhall be deſtroyed</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">Ionah 3.</note>: yet Ninivie repenting, Ninivie was not then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, God changed his revealed will and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, the propheſie fell, but the Citie fell not; yea, the ſame puniſhment, which at the firſt threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is conditionall, yet afterwards may become abſolute and unavoidable; as the deſtruction of Sodome, conditionally threatned, when as at <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſuit the Lord was brought from fiftie to ten, <hi>If there be found but ten righteous perſons in Sodome, I will ſpare it for the ten ſake</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Gen. 18. <hi>penult.</hi>
               </note>: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they could not be found, the deſtruction was abſolutely threatned, when the Angell ſaid to <hi>Lot, We will deſtroy this place, the Lord hath ſent us to deſtroy it</hi>

the Prophet, the Lord grew to be reſolute, they ſhould into captivitie as well as their brethren, he revealed it unto his Prophet, and forbade him to pray for them, which he did, and only counſelled them to yeeld themſelves into their enemies hands.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by way of prevention, God ſatisfied his Prophet, in what he foreſaw might be obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. <note place="margin">3. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Prevention of objections.</note> The Prophet might object, that hereby both his juſtice and truth might be queſtioned; he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfieth the Prophet in both: firſt he cleareth his juſtice, and that two wayes; firſt, by declaring the greatneſſe of this peoples ſinne; (whereof you <note place="margin">Iuſtice.</note> ſhall more hereafter) for a taſte, looke but the next verſe following my text: <hi>Seeſt thou not what they</hi>

               <hi>doe in the Cities of Iudah, and ſtreets of Ieruſalem?

            <p>Secondly, he declareth his ſoveraigne and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute <note place="margin">2. Declaration of abſolute ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie.</note> authoritie, over all people and nations, ſo as without controll, he may juſtly build and plant, or pull downe and deſtroy: which he ſhewed in the pottershouſe, in whoſe hands a veſſel that he made of clay being marred, he made it another veſſell, as ſeemed good to the potter <note n="o" place="margin">Ierem. 18. 1, 6.</note>; then came the word of the Lord, ſaying, <hi>O houſe of Iſrael, cannot I doe with you, as this potter? behold, as the clay is in the hands of the potter, ſo are yee in mine hands.</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:3489:15"/>
The clay is not beholden to the potter, for it had being before; and the clay never offended the pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet the potter may make what veſſell he will, and the veſſell not complaine, <hi>Why haſt thou made me thus?</hi> But we are beholding to God for our being, and we have ſinned againſt him, and may he not doe with us as pleaſeth him?

Then ſayd the Lord, the Prophets propheſie lies in my name, I ſent them not, neither have I commanded them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpoken unto them, they propheſie a falſe viſion and divination, the deceit of their owne heart, but I will bring the ſword, yea and by the ſword ſhall thoſe falſe Prophets alſo be conſumed</hi>

               <note n="q" place="margin">Ier. 27. 9, 10, 14.</note>. Thus God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteth his Prophet, and declareth that this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is well deſerved, and ſtandeth with juſtice and truth, and would have the Prophet to reſt therein, and not pray for them.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3489:15"/>
was firſt with many words of moſt earneſt and vehement aſſeveration, ſaying, <hi>The land ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate, the earth ſhall mourne, and the heavens above be blacke, I have ſpoken it, I have purpoſed it, and will not repent, neither will I turne backe from it</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">Ierem. 4. 28.</note>. That muſt needs ſtand, which the Lord thus avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; yet to make it, if it were poſſible, more ſure, the Lord hath ſworne it, <hi>I ſweare by my ſelfe, (ſaith</hi>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3489:16"/>
himſelfe to Gods holy will and pleaſure.</p>
            <p>The maine objection (which I know of) that may be made either againſt this ſenſe delivered, or <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> the practice of our Prophet, is a like Prohibition to <hi>Moſes:</hi> which yet was but conditionall, for he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently prayed and prevailed; ſo we reade, that in <hi>Moſes</hi> abſence, the people cauſing <hi>Aaron</hi> to make a golden calfe, which they worſhipped, God told <hi>Moſes</hi> what a great ſinne they had committed, and addeth, <hi>Now therefore let me alone, that I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume them, and I will make of thee a great nation; and Moſes beſought the Lord, and he repented of the evill which he thought to doe to his people</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 32. 10.</note>. I anſwer, that betwixt that to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and this to <hi>Ieremie,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Forme.</hi>
               </note> there is a great difference; for howſoever that be delivered to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Imperative as well as this, yet that carrieth the face of a milde inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and intimateth, that it was in <hi>Moſes</hi> power to give leave, or to let God: ſo as <hi>Moſes</hi> receiveth thereby encouragement to pray. What is it for God to ſay, <hi>Let me alone,</hi> but to make him bold to pray <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Quid eſt,</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte, <hi>niſi depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candi anſam prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere? Gregor.</hi>
               </note>; but this charge is with waightie words, <hi>Thou ſhalt not pray, nor crie, nor make interceſsion, for I will not heare thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Moſes</hi> was but once bid let God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; <note place="margin">2. <hi>Repetition.</hi>
               </note> but our Prophet was thrice expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to pray for them <note n="x" place="margin">Ierem. 7. 16. 11. 14. 14. 11.</note>. Now if <hi>Ioſeph</hi> told <hi>Pharaoh</hi> his dreame was doubled, becauſe the thing was eſtabliſhed of God; he will bring it to paſſe <note n="y" place="margin">Gen. 41. 32.</note>; how much more may I ſay, this charge is tripled to his Prophet, to ſignifie that he meaneth good ſooth, their captivitie is decreed and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3489:16"/>
of God, and he will bring it to paſſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and laſtly, God threatned to <hi>Moſes,</hi> he would utterly conſume the people, yea, <hi>and blot</hi> 
               <note place="margin">3. <hi>Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>out their name from under heaven</hi> 
               <note n="z" place="margin">Deut. 9. 14.</note>; that God could not doe, but much diſhonour his name; and therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> urgeth in his prayer, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould the Aegyptians ſpeake and ſay, <hi>For miſchiefe did he bring them out, to ſlay them in the mountaines, and to conſume them from the face of the earth.</hi> Againe, to doe ſo, were to breake promiſe and oath, which he had made with their fathers, and therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> doth ſpecially urge that, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Abraham, Iſaack, and Iſrael thy ſervants, to whom thou ſwareſt by thine owne ſelfe, and ſaydſt unto them, I will multiply your ſeed, as the ſtarres of heaven, and all this land that I have ſpoken of, will I give unto your ſeed, and they ſhall inherit it</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 32. 12, 13.</note>. So that what face ſoever it carried, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw well enough, God did not meane he ſhould not pray for them. But the caſe is here altered; firſt, Gods glorie is no way endangered, no more than it was by the captivitie of the ten Tribes; nay, this was greatly for his glorie; firſt, that all nations might ſee what a juſt God he is, who will not forbeare to puniſh ſinne, no not in his owne people; for many nations ſhall ſay, <hi>Wherefore hath the Lord done thus to this great Citie?</hi> and they ſhall anſwer, <hi>Becauſe they have forſaken the covenant of the Lord their God, and worſhipped other Gods, and ſerved them</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Ierem. 22. 9.</note>; but his deliverance of them out of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie ſhould be much more for his glorie, for hee meant that ſhould be more eminent and glorious
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3489:17"/>
than their deliverance out of Aegypt was, ſo as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that time it ſhould be no more ſaid, <hi>The Lord liveth that brought up the children of Iſrael out of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt; but the Lord liveth that brought up the children of Iſrael from the land of the North, and from all the lands whither he had driven them</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Ierem. 16. 14.</note>. See how great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their captivitie ſhould be for his glorie. Neither was this againſt any promiſe or oath: for hee had already performed them, he had caſt out the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and planted Iſrael in. Yea rather herein God was as good as his word, for hee had threatned them, if they were rebellious and diſobedient, he would give them into the hands of their enemies, and they ſhould reigne over them <note n="d" place="margin">Deut. 28. 48.</note>. Thus I hope, by conference of Scriptures, I have ſufficiently cleared the ſenſe of this, <hi>viz.</hi> that it was an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute prohibition <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Abſolutè &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitè imperaſſe Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiae, ne oraret. Barrad. Itinerar. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 19. <hi>pag.</hi> 379.</note>; and therefore, howſoever the Prophet was exceedingly afflicted; to foreſee in ſpirit, and afterwards to ſee with the eyes of his bodie the captivitie of the Iewes, and deſolation of the Citie and Temple, neither was hee ever wanting to give them good counſell, and pray in other caſes for them; yet in this, he might not; in this he did not. Now it followeth to build do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, for Inſtruction, Conſolation, and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion; and by application to make them uſefull unto us: which doctrines naturally ariſing, are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and namely theſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, God commonly giveth warning, before <note place="margin">1. <hi>Doct.</hi>
               </note> he bring any judgement upon any place or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſpecially on his Church or people, or on any place, where his people are. This doctrine will
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3489:17"/>
be ſufficiently proved, both from poſitive and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarie Scriptures. Thus ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Lord God will doe nothing, but hee revealeth his ſecrets unto his ſervants the Prophets</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Amos 3. 7.</note>. Before God brought the floud, God revealed it to <hi>Noah</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 6. 13.</note>, who by word of mouth, and building the Arke, gave warning to the old world, for 120. yeeres <note n="g" place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 20.</note>: before hee ſent fire and brimſtone to conſume the Cities in the plaine, hee revealed it to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and then to <hi>Lot,</hi> and his children <note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 18. 17. 19. 12, 13.</note>: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the judgements were executed on <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and Aegypt, God revealed it to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="margin">Exod. 3. 19, 20.</note>: before he deſtroyed Ninivie, he gave knowledge thereof to <hi>Ionah,</hi> and he proclaimed, <hi>Yet fortie dayes, and Ninivie ſhall be deſtroyed</hi> 
               <note n="k" place="margin">Ionah 4. 10.</note>. The Iewes ſhall not be deſtroyed, but the day and time ſhall be firſt proclaimed, that Gods people may betake themſelves to faſting and prayer. Before the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie of the ten Tribes, God revealed it to many of his Prophets, as <hi>Iſaiah, Iehu, Eliah, Michaiah, Obadiah, Hoſheah, Amos, Ioel:</hi> that, as before a great ſtorme the cocks crow loud and thicke; ſo before this great judgement, the Prophets threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and cried loud and ſhrill; before the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Beniamin,</hi> many other Prophets knew of it, and were ſent to threaten it, as <hi>Eſay, Ezechiel, Zephanie,</hi> and our Prophet, who moſt plainly told them, for how long it ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue. How were the Iewes abundantly warned, before their finall deſtruction and diſperſion? how is Babylon fore warned? how thoſe golden Churches in Aſia Minor? how are wee all fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3489:18"/>
of the deſtruction of the world by fire? how are we all forewarned of the deſtruction of the wicked in hell fire? yea, what judgement can befall us, but our conſciences muſt needs teſtifie, that ſome way or other, yea many wayes, God hath given us warning? All which doe ſufficiently confirme our doctrine, that commonly God doth give warning, before hee bring any great judgement upon his people, or any place where his people are. Only this is to be lamented, that people will take no warning. <hi>As it was in the dayes of Noah, ſo ſhall it be at the end of the world, Matth.</hi> 24. The men of the old world had warning faire enough, and yet knew nothing, would know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: wee have warning enough, but moſt will take no warning, but walke on ſtill, and will know nothing, till the heavens be all on a flaming fire, the trumpet ſound, yea hell fire ſeaze upon them; and then it is too late.</p>
            <p>You will aske me, by what meanes doth God <note place="margin">2. <hi>Meanes.</hi>
               </note> give people ſuch warning?</p>
            <p>I anſwer: the meanes are of two ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie, and extraordinarie; the ordinarie meanes, is the miniſterie of his ſervants: as of <hi>Noah</hi> to the old world, <hi>Lot</hi> to Sodome, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to Aegypt, Prophets to Iudah and Iſrael, Chriſt and his Apoſtles to the Iewes, <hi>Ionah</hi> to Ninivie, (as you have heard) Meanes extraordinarie are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; as terrible ſignes in Sunne, Moone, and Stars; earth-quakes, thunders, flaſhes of lightning, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging windes, roaring of ſeas; of all which, though ſome naturall reaſons may bee probably
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3489:18"/>
rendred, yet being extraordinarie, they doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime, in their kinde, Gods anger, and threaten ſome judgement. So Chriſt ſaid, before his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to judgement, <hi>there ſhould be ſignes in Sunne, Moone, Stars, Aire, Earth, Sea, ſo as mens hearts ſhould faile with feare, Luc.</hi> 21. 25. <hi>Ioſephus</hi> and others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſtrange things, before the finall deſtruction of Ieruſalem, as a dreadful blazing ſtar, fearfull ſights, of armies of men, chariots and horſes in the aire, a voice heard in the Temple, <hi>Migremus hinc,</hi> Let us goe hence. But of all preſages, that is moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, which <hi>Ioſephus</hi> hath, <hi>De bello Iudaico, lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. <hi>De prodigijs &amp; praeſagijs:</hi> One <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Ananus,</hi> foure yeeres before the Romanes came, when the Citie was in great peace and opulencie, hee began to cry up and downe in the Citie, and ſpecially in the Temple, and that upon their moſt ſolemne feſtivities, Woe, woe to Ieruſalem: and being privately by many, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards publikely by Magiſtrates, both rebuked, puniſhed, and threatned, to hold his peace; yet he held on, ſo long as he was able day and night, till in the end the enemies came, and hee walking upon the wals, and crying as before, Woe to the people, woe to Ieruſalem, and woe to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, at the laſt he alſo cryed out, And woe to me. At which words, <hi>lapis tormento miſſus,</hi> a ſtone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing throwne by ſome warlike inſtrument then in uſe, it hit him in the head: ſo ended he his life and preſage; which ſome accounted to proceed from divine inſtinct.</p>
            <p>God often gave them into the hands of their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3489:19"/>
enemies, and often delivered them, and everie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance was as a warning-peece, to ſinne no more, leſt he would deliver them no more. Everie mercie abuſed is a warning-peece, and threatneth judgement, <hi>Woe to Capernaum, which had beene ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted to heaven.</hi> Likewiſe leſſer judgements (when people doe not repent) doe threaten greater, as everie leſſer plague in Aegypt did threaten a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the heele of it, according to Gods threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>If for theſe things thou wilt not repent, I will puniſh thee ſeven times more, Levit.</hi> 26. Now Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah and Ieruſalem muſt to it, becauſe they would not be warned by the calamitie of their brethren. Deliverances from evils not thankfully received, nor godly uſe made of them, threaten judgements: yea, mercies abuſed threaten judgement: and the greater mercies abuſed, the greater judgements threatned; loe theſe are the meanes, beſides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, for it is not poſſible to reckon up all.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, would you know the Reaſons of this <note place="margin">3. Reaſons.</note> the Lords manner of dealing, why he doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly warne and threaten, before hee bring a judgment? The reaſons are principally theſe three. Firſt, in regard of himſelfe: Secondly, in regard of the godly: Thirdly, in regard of the wicked.</p>
            <p>For the firſt; This he doth, to declare the riches of his mercie; how ſlow to judgement, and loth to <note place="margin">1. <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
               </note> avenge himſelfe he is; and therefore will not ſmite any, before he diſcharge a warning-peece, that all the world may give him glorie for his mercie, goodneſſe, and (when no meanes will ſerve) moſt righteous judgements.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:3489:19"/>
Secondly, for his peoples ſake, that being threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and warned, they teſtifying their faith and <note place="margin">2. <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
               </note> repentance, by faſting and prayer, may either turne away Gods wrath, or finde comfort in the day of calamitie.</p>
            <p>The third &amp; laſt reaſon is in regard of the wicked, that they being threatned and warned, and taking <note place="margin">3. <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
               </note> none, but flattering themſelves, lulling themſelves aſleepe in ſecuritie, winking with their eyes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will not ſee Gods judgements, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themſelves there is no ſuch matter, eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Prophets words but as winde, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of all ſignes from heaven and earth, but as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from naturall cauſes, &amp; laughing at thoſe as ſilly fooles, that make any divine uſe, or are afraid of Gods anger and judgements; <hi>Put the evill day farre off, ſay peace, peace; having made a covenant with death, and are at an agreement with hell, that all ſuch wickedneſſe may be cut off, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh without excuſe.</hi> Lo theſe are the reaſons.</p>
            <p>Now if wee make Application, who ſeeth not that the hand of God is verie heavie upon divers <note place="margin">Application.</note> of the reformed Churches abroad, in famine, war, and all the miſeries that accompanie it. But I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand with the Apoſtle, Have they not heard? were they not warned? did theſe judgements come upon them, like a flaſh of lightning, no fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of them? Yes, yes, they had the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſervants of God, who zealouſly reproved their profanation of Sabbaths, taking of Gods name in vaine, drunkenneſſe, whoredome, pride, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, and foretold the judgements of God
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3489:20"/>
without repentance: They ſaw that terrible bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, and heard that ſtately tongue of Heaven <note n="*" place="margin">Magniloqua lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gua Coeli.</note>, which preached theſe things to them that had eares to heare <note n="p" place="margin">Matth. 24. 25.</note>. To come to our ſelves, we Gods Miniſters have told you of theſe things before. What have wee told you? When and how God will puniſh this land? No, we could not tell you ſo, but we have faithfully told you, the ſinnes of this land crie unto God for vengeance, God is a juſt God, and if ſinne be not repented of, hee will puniſh; there is no corner of the land, but for many yeeres hath rung with theſe warnings. We ſaw alſo that prodigious ſtarre, we heard that Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, (I feare you will forget it.) God hath moſt marvellouſly delivered us from forraine Invaſion, and fierie furnace of Gunpowder treaſon. The windes have roared, and ſea broken in, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of whole valleyes, and diſpeopling of many pariſhes; the laſt winter hath beene long and extreme, the preſent ſpring backward, the fruits of the earth in great meaſure deſtroyed, a famine ſuddenly come upon us: are not all theſe as warning peeces? And unto them all adde this, as the greateſt of all, that by the calamitie of our neighbours he doth admoniſh us to repent, who (for any thing that I know) are as great ſinners as they; ſo as if God ſhould bring upon us a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier judgement than he hath done upon them, yet were it moſt juſt, our conſciences muſt needs wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, we have had warning abundantly: But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, bleſſed be God, who hath given, and doth daily give us ſuch faire and full warning of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3489:20"/>
the laſt judgement and deſtruction of all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate in hell fire, oh beware of them.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Doctrine is, that all Gods true ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, when they ſee by evident ſignes, that the <note place="margin">2. <hi>Doct.</hi>
               </note> Lords anger is kindled againſt his people for their ſinnes, and perceive ſome fearefull judgements to come upon them, they are wonderfully affected therewith, take it to heart, and labour by all good meanes to pacifie and prevent it.</p>
            <p>This doctrine ariſeth from this word, <hi>Doe not</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> 
               <hi>lift up a (crie) unto mee;</hi> which noteth, that hee would not in a cold and ſenſleſſe manner have prayed, but as being wonderfully affected to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee the miſerie of Gods people for their ſinnes, he would with ſighes and groanes, yea and bitter teares, have prayed to God for them, if he had not bid him hold his peace; for to cry in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, when it is referred to praying, noteth, to pray unto God in moſt earneſt and vehement manner; as where God asked <hi>Moſes, Why crieſt thou unto mee</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">Exod. 14. 15.</note>? and <hi>David</hi> complaineth, <hi>O my God, I crie by day,</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">Pſal. 22. 2.</note> 
               <hi>and thou heareſt not;</hi> and the Apoſtle ſaith, That our Saviour, <hi>in the dayes of his fleſh did offer up prayers and ſupplications, with ſtrong crying and teares</hi> 
               <note n="s" place="margin">Heb. 5. 7.</note>: In all which (and many other places which might be alledged to this purpoſe) <hi>crying</hi> doth rather ſignifie mournfull intention of <note place="margin">Examples.</note> heart, zeale and fervencie of ſpirit, rather than any loud vociferation and contentions of words. And from this word our Doctrin ariſeth; which would firſt bee confirmed and backed with ſome other Scriptures. And to begin with <hi>Moſes:</hi> when hee
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:3489:21"/>
ſaw imminent deſtruction to the people of God at the red ſea, he cried unto God <note n="t" place="margin">Exod. 14. 15.</note>: little did any know the bitter affliction of his ſoule, but God who ſaw it, and revealed it, <hi>Moſes why crieſt thou?</hi> How was <hi>David</hi> moved, when he ſaw the Angell that ſmote the people, and ſaid, <hi>Lo, I have ſinned and dealt wickedly, but theſe ſheepe what have they done</hi> 
               <note n="u" place="margin">2 Sam. ult. 17.</note>? Holy King <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> when hee heard from reading the Booke of the Law that was found, what great wrath of God was kindled againſt the people for their ſinnes, to <hi>make them a deſolation and a curſe,</hi> he rent his cloathes, his heart melted, and his eyes poured out abundance of teares <note n="*" place="margin">2 King. 22. 19.</note>. How did godly <hi>Mordechai</hi> and <hi>Heſther</hi> take to heart the decree gone out for the deſtruction of the people of God, and humble themſelves with ſack-cloth, faſting, weeping, and praying, crying with loud and bitter cries <note n="x" place="margin">Heſt. 4. 1.</note>? When <hi>Ezrah</hi> heard of the great ſinnes of the people, and foreſaw ſome imminent judgement, <hi>hee rent his garment, plucked off the haire of his head and beard, and did neither eat bread, nor drinke water, but mourned ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly</hi> 
               <note n="y" place="margin">Ezrah 9. 5.</note>: The Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> foreſeeing the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie of Gods people, ſaid, <hi>Turne away from me, I will weepe bitterly, labour not to comfort me, becauſe of the ſpoiling of the daughter of my people</hi> 
               <note n="z" place="margin">Eſay 22. 4.</note>: Our Prophet exceeded in this, who thus complained, <hi>My bowels, my bowels, I am pained at the very heart, mine heart maketh a noiſe in mee, I cannot hold my peace, becauſe I have heard the ſound of the trumpet, and alarum of warre, deſtruction upon deſtruction is cried</hi>

               <note n="c" place="margin">Ierem. 14. 17.</note>: The Prophet <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> upon the ſame occaſion, ſeeing the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels deſtroying Gods people, feil on his face, and cried, <hi>Oh Lord God, wilt thou deſtroy all the reſidue of Iſrael, in pouring out thy furie on Ieruſalem</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Ezech. 9. 8.</note>? Our bleſſed Saviour wept, when hee propheſied the deſtruction of Ieruſalem <note n="e" place="margin">Luk. 19. 41.</note>.

By which cloud of witneſſes, out of the old and new Teſtament, our doctrine is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently confirmed, <hi>viz.</hi> That when Gods anger is ſeene, and ſome great judgement to befall Gods people is foreſeene, Gods true ſervants are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected therewith, and labour to prevent it. It being then moſt cleere that it is ſo, let us now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to conſider the reaſons thereof, why it is ſo, and why they are thus affected.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, becauſe there is nothing ſo ſweet <note place="margin">1. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Gods love.</note> and deare unto them as Gods love and favour, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doth ſo much affect them with joy as the ſenſe thereof.

            <p>The ſecond reaſon is, becauſe (next unto God) Gods Church and people are dearely beloved, of all the true members thereof, as being the people <note place="margin">2. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> They love his Church.</note> that God hath redeemed with his bloud <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 20. 28.</note>, entred into perpetuall league and covenant with, yea, the ſpouſe of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 32. and therefore it wonderfully affecteth Gods ſervants with griefe, and maketh them cry, when they foreſee any judgement or miſerie befall them; the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">Amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> in the miſerie of Gods Church, Gods glory ſeemeth to be ſtained; whereof they are ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, that rather than that ſhould happen, <hi>Moſes</hi> wiſhed to be <hi>blotted out of the booke</hi>

               </note>. Oh how father <hi>Eli</hi> was afflicted at the report of heavie newes, when one told him, that Iſrael was fled before the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims, his two ſonnes ſlaine, and the Arke of God taken!

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3489:23"/>
from his ſeat, and broke his necke <note n="z" place="margin">1 Sam. 4. 18.</note>; and his daughter in law hearing the ſame newes, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fell into the throwes of travaile, and being delivered of a ſonne, called his name <hi>Ichabod.</hi> When zealous <hi>Nehemiah</hi> heard how the people of God were in great affliction, Ieruſalem broken downe, and the gates burnt with fire, he could not containe himſelfe, but ſate downe and wept, and being the Kings Cup-bearer, (and as much as his office and life was worth, to appeare ſad, and hee never had beene ſo before) yet now he could not hide it, his countenance bewrayed it, the King tooke notice of it, and asked him, <hi>Why is thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance ſad,</hi>

               <hi>ſeeing thou art not ſicke, this is nothing elſe but ſorrow of heart?</hi> Oh the ruines of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem lay at his heart; which alſo made the people of God ſo imprecate themſelves, <hi>If I forget Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, let my right hand forget her cunning, yea, let my tongue cleave to the roofe of my mouth, if I preferre not Ieruſalem to my chiefeſtioy</hi>

            <p>The third and laſt reaſon (whereof fleſh and bloud are more ſenſible, than the two former) is, <note place="margin">3. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Wrapping in the ſame judgement.</note> That the godly may be wrapped with the wicked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the ſame temporall puniſhment: and therefore when they ſee it comming, they are much affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and labour to prevent it.

               <note n="e" place="margin">Exod. 32. 10.

Let him that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that ſtory, conſider how farre the judgements of God may extend themſelves, towards all ſuch as are not affected with Gods anger, and doe not to the uttermoſt of their power endevour to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſin.

               <note n="i" place="margin">Ioſh. 22. 18.</note>. If then the zeale of Gods glorie, and love to Gods people will not move, yet the love to ourſelves and eſtates, may move us to mourne for ſinnes and abominations of the land, and to take great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to heart, the tokens of anger, and threatnings of judgements, becauſe wee alſo may be wrapped up in them.</p>

And hiſtories report, that before the laſt and finall deſolation of Ieruſalem, there was a voice heard amongſt the Chriſtians, Goe forth to Pella, goe forth to Pella; which ſo ſoone as ever the Chriſtians had done, and that they were ſafe there, the Citie was ſacked, and the wrath of God poured out upon it to the uttermoſt <note n="c" place="margin">1 Theſſ. 2. 16.</note>.

Doth it availe <hi>Ieremie,</hi> that he hath ſo bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly wept, mourned and lamented, and prayed unto God? Yes, yes, becauſe hee had beene ſo faithfull, God provided well for him, for <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> himſelfe gave charge to <hi>Nebuzaradan</hi> his chiefe ſteward, to looke well to <hi>Ieremie,</hi> and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3489:25"/>
doe for him as he would, and let him goe whither he would; and indeed he did ſo, putting him to his choice, whether he would goe to Babylon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive kindneſſe there, or ſtay in Iudah: and becauſe he deſired rather to ſtay in Iudah, hee gave him vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals and a reward, and let him goe whither hee would <note n="f" place="margin">Ier. 40. 2, 3, 4, 5.</note>, ſo as he found a great deale more favour from the enemies, than hee did from his owne Princes and people. Yea (and worthie to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) <hi>Ebedmelech,</hi> who had ſpoken good to the King, and beene a meanes to deliver him out of the dungeon, God promiſed him his life for a prey, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 39. <hi>ult.</hi> And <hi>Gedaliah,</hi> whoſe father <hi>Ahikam</hi> had beene his great friend, and ſaved his life, <hi>Ier.</hi> 26. <hi>ult.</hi> And <hi>Baruch</hi> his Scribe, and others that feared God, and had beene <hi>Ieremies</hi> friends, and encouragement, even theſe had their lives given for a prey, were left behinde in the land, and <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daliah</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Ahikam,</hi> made their governour in Mizpah <note n="g" place="margin">Ierem. 38. 7. 39. 15. 26. 24. 40. 5.</note>.</p>
            <p>Oh thus the Lord hath many wayes to deliver his out of troubles and miſeries, and hee will doe it, if it be for his glorie and their good; if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <note place="margin">Vſe.</note> hee be pleaſed to wrap them up in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon calamitie, yet even that ſhall turne to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of their ſalvation, and God will ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich them with patience and comfort in aſſurance of Gods love, that in ſuch miſerie, they ſhall bee moſt happie.

            <p>The Doctrine being thus confirmed, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <note place="margin">Teſtimonies.</note> thereof rendred, and objection againſt the

practiſe thereof removed; it now followeth to conſider what are the teſtimonies, whereby Gods ſervants doe witneſſe to others, and ſpecially to God, and their owne ſoules, that they are amongſt the ſmall number of ſuch as doe take Gods anger and judgements to heart:</p>
            <p>And they are of two ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> common to all <note place="margin">Diviſion.</note> Gods good ſervants, and ſpeciall or proper to <note place="margin">Common.</note> ſome ſorts of them: the common teſtimonies are of two ſorts, private and publike; private teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies <note place="margin">Teſtimonies pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.</note> are praier, and interceſſion, helped with faſting and humiliation, that ſo they may pray the more fervently, and cry mightily unto God to ſpare his people. No ſooner did God reveale to <hi>Abraham,</hi> his purpoſe to deſtroy Sodome, but he fell inſtantly to praier, and moſt vehemently importuned him to ſpare them <note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 18. 22.</note>. When did God ever manifeſt to <hi>Moſes</hi> his conceived anger againſt his people, and threatned a judgement, but <hi>Moſes</hi> was downe on his face crying to the Lord, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with him, and urging of him, for his name and glory, grace and goodneſſe, mercies, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, oath, and covenant, to forgive and ſpare <note n="i" place="margin">Deut. 9. 18.</note>? When <hi>Nehemiah</hi> heard of the miſery of Gods people, and Ieruſalem, <hi>he ſate downe and wept, and faſted, and prayed, before the God of heaven</hi> 
               <note n="k" place="margin">Neh. 1. 4.</note>: The ſecond are more publike, and are either of geſture, as in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> or words, when every <note place="margin">2.

So <hi>Mordechai,</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:3489:26"/>
(when he heard of the bloudy Decree that was paſſed) was not contented to put on ſackcloth and mourne in ſecret, but went into the midſt of the City, and cried with a loud and bitter cry, and made it knowne to <hi>Heſther,</hi> and <hi>Heſther</hi> would have all the Iewes in Shuſhan to faſt too <note n="l" place="margin">Heſt. 4. 1. 16.</note>. The Prophet ſaith, <hi>All ſuch as feared God, ſtirred up one another, by ſpeaking often to one another, ſaying, feare the Lord</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Malac. 3. 16.</note>. This is it the Apoſtle aimeth at, <hi>Exhort one another daily whilſt it is called to day, leſt any of you be hardened through the deceitfulneſſe of ſinne</hi>

            <p>The more proper and ſpeciall teſtimonies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne <note place="margin">Proper teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</note> two ſorts of Gods ſervants, <hi>viz.</hi> the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Magiſtrate. The faithfull Miniſter of <note place="margin">1. The Miniſters.</note> God, teſtifieth that he taketh to heart the anger of <note place="margin">1. Giving war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> God, and threatned judgement, by three things. Firſt, <hi>by lifting up his voice like a trumpet</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">Eſay 58. 1.</note>, and giving warning, for which purpoſe they have the titles of <hi>Seers</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">1 Sam. 9. 9.</note>, and <hi>Watchmen</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">Eſay 62. 6.</note>, <hi>I have ſet watchmen upon thy wals, O Ieruſalem.</hi> They muſt have eies in their heads, and from their watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tower, <note place="margin">As the ſleepie and careleſſe watchman is hanged, that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth no warning, ſo the Miniſter muſt anſwer for bloud of ſoules.</note> ſee anger and judgement afarre off, and like faithfull watchmen, from the wall, give war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the City, as ſoone as ever they deſcry the Lord comming againſt his people. Secondly, they muſt labour by their Miniſtery, to bring the people to repentance, that ſo Gods wrath may be <note place="margin">2. Preach repent.</note> pacified, and judgements prevented; and to that end, they muſt faithfully reprove them for their
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3489:27"/>
ſinnes, and let them ſee the hainouſneſſe of their tranſgreſſions, and call earneſtly upon them for repentance. Thus did <hi>Noah</hi> before the floud, <hi>Lot</hi> before the burning of Sodom, the Prophets <hi>Iſay, Ieremy, Ezechiel, Ioel,</hi> before the Captivities: <hi>Rent your hearts and not your garments, and turne to the Lord your God,</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">Ioel 2. 13.</note>: thus did Chriſt and <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> before the finall deſtruction of the Iewes, <hi>Repent, repent, Except yee repent yee ſhall all periſh</hi> 
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Luk. 13. 3.</note>: <hi>Now is the axe laid to the root of the tree;</hi> and, <hi>O gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of vipers, who hath forewarned you to flee from the anger to come? bring forth fruits worthy amendment of life</hi> 
               <note n="t" place="margin">Matt. 3. 7. 10.</note>: yea thus have all Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants done, that deſire to be free from the bloud of all men <note n="u" place="margin">Act. 20. 26.</note>: for if they give not warning, the bloud is required at their hands <note n="*" place="margin">Ezek. 3. 18.</note>, and therefore it behoveth them to beſtirre themſelves, that if it be poſſible they may ſave Gods people from the wrath to come, or at leaſt deliver their own ſoules, and be found a ſweet ſavour unto God, even in them that perish <note n="x" place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 15.</note>.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is the faithfull Miniſters duty to be very tenderly affected towards all ſuch as mourne <note place="margin">Thirdly, preach comfort.</note> in Sion <note n="y" place="margin">Eſay 61. 3.</note>; and with <hi>David</hi> are afraid of Gods judgements <note n="z" place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note>; they muſt be ſure to ſpeake a word in due ſeaſon to ſuch as are weary <note n="a" place="margin">Eſay 50. 4.</note>. God gave the Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> a charge, to ſpeake comfortably to the heart of Ieruſalem <note n="b" place="margin">Eſay 40. 2.</note>. And hence it is that the Prophets, Chriſt, <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, did ever interlace reproofes and threatnings, with heavenly comforts, to prepare them for times of triall and tentations; that howſoever
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:3489:27"/>
they lived amongſt the wicked, and ſome great judgement and generall might come, yet come what will, it ſhould goe well with them; yea let vs Miniſters be aſſured, the Lord will require as ſtrict an account of us, how we have cheared and comforted the godly, as that we have reproved and threatned the wicked.</p>
            <p>And I ſay upon this occaſion, in the word of the <note place="margin">Exhortation.</note> Lord, Be of good comfort all godly Magiſtrates, <note place="margin">1.

            <p>The ſecond duty particular, is for the chiefe <note place="margin">2. To Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates.</note> Magiſtrate to command ſuch as are ſubordinate and inferiour, to ſee execution; theſe are to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, how greatly they are affected with tokens of Gods wrath, and appearance of judgements, by labouring to reforme ſinne, and enjoyning fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and humiliation, for pacifying of Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and preventing of judgements. Thus did <hi>Moſes, Ioſhuah, David, Iehoſhaphat, Nehemiah, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi> King of Ninivie. It would aske too long a time, to ſhew you how wonderfully God hath beene appeaſed, and how ſtrangely judgements have beene prevented, by this moſt godly and Chriſtian exerciſe: the Scriptures are plentifull in this point. Yea it is regiſtred, that even <hi>Ahab,</hi> only thereunto moved with a baſe feare of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment threatned, and but faſting and wearing
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:3489:28"/>
ſackcloth in hypocriſie, God deferred the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment untill his ſonnes daies <note n="m" place="margin">1 King. 21. 27.</note>. Oh what a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing did this Land receive hereupon in <hi>Ann.</hi> 1588. I am perſwaded, never any did humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before the Lord, in true faſting and praier, but found a bleſſing from heaven thereon. Oh that I could but perſwade you to make triall hereof, and to prove the Lord herein: I aſſure my ſelfe, God is the ſame loving God, as ready now as ever, moſt graciouſly to anſwer the ſoule that ſetteth it ſelfe aright to ſeeke God, by ſuch waies and meanes as he hath preſcribed.</p>
            <p>Now let us come and make application of theſe things to ourſelves. That God hath many waies <note place="margin">Application.</note> teſtified his anger and diſpleaſure, and not only threatned, but alſo in ſome meaſure executed his judgements, who ſo blinde as ſeeth not? But how <note place="margin">Examination.</note> are men and women affected herewith? Doe we, in the conſcience of our ſinnes, judge our ſelves <note place="margin">Sight of ſinne.</note> unworthy of any common bleſſing, peace, food, <note place="margin">Vnworthineſſe.</note> ſleepe, apparell; and moſt worthy of all thoſe heavie judgements, which either he hath threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or executed on any others? Are we afraid of Gods judgements, and ſpecially of thoſe that <note place="margin">Feare.</note> are ſpirituall? I ſay againe, of thoſe that are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and moſt dreadfull? Doe we grieve excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly <note place="margin">Sorrow.</note> and mourne in our ſoules, that we have ſo juſtly offended God, and purchaſed his anger and diſpleaſure, and to have the very floudgates and all the ſluces of his judgements drawne up, to our utter overthrow and deſtruction? Doe we bend our ſelves with all our ſtrength to pacific <note place="margin">Prevention.</note>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:3489:29"/>
God, and prevent his judgements? And to that end, doe we with full purpoſe of heart, reſolve to forſake our owne knowne ſins? and to put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe all holy purpoſes and vowes? to reforme pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently whatſoever we know to be amiſſe in us? and to ſhew forth more true zeale of Gods glory, and the power of godlineſſe in our lives, than we have done? Doe we poure out our ſoules in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant praiers and ſupplications, with ſighs and groanes unto God, for ourſelves and his Church? and as our callings and gifts enable and give leaue, doe we ſtirre up and provoke others to doe ſo?</p>
            <p>If this be ſo, it is happy, and I cannot but comfortably aſſure myſelfe, there are thouſands <note place="margin">Conſolation.</note> and ten thouſands that doe ſo; yea how abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly have men and women in this Land, in this Countrey, and in this City, declared their love to the Goſpell, and compaſſion to the poore diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saints that profeſſe it? which, I doubt not, but God hath regiſtred in his booke, and will, in his good time, remunerate with a large recompence of reward; and I truſt we ſhall yet ſee Ieruſalem in proſperity, and peace upon Iſrael. How ever it pleaſe God to deale, yet all ſuch ſhall finde grace, mercy, and peace with God; let ſuch caſt their care on God, for he careth for them.</p>
            <p>But let me lament, that there are too too many amongſt us, Atheiſts, Papiſts, prophane and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious <note place="margin">Lamentation.</note> perſons, as ſenſleſſe as blocks and ſtones of their ſinnes, Gods anger, and Gods judgements: who being called to weeping and mourning, bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

Tell them of their ſinnes, they doe not know any ſuch things, nor beleeve that any are better than themſelves.

               <note n="u" place="margin">Eſay 28. 15.</note>. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are angrie with the Prophets that threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as they accuſed <hi>Ieremie</hi> to the King, that the world was not able to beare his words, that hee diſcouraged the people, and was never well, till he was in priſon, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 38. 4. Thus they put off the evill day farre from them, and approach to the ſeat of iniquitie, going from evill to worſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all feare of God or man, hating to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
            <p>Oh prophane Atheiſts, Belly-gods, and World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, <note place="margin">Concluſion.</note> know that it is not for your ſakes that God ſpareth, it is for his ſervants ſakes, amongſt whom yee live, that yee enjoy ſo large a ſhare in many good bleſſings of God; ſuch as yee deſpiſe and make a mocke of, yea extremely hate and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, are they, that ſtand in the breach, and turne <note place="margin">Commination</note> away Gods judgements; but if our ſinnes grow ſo full, and God make way for his fierie wrath, by taking away ſuch, and that his judgements doe breake out, you ſhall not eſcape, nay you ſhall drinke deepe of the cup of Gods wrath, yea ſucke and wring out the verie dregs of the ſame <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 75. 8.</note>; you ſhall finde your ſtaves to be but broken reeds <note n="x" place="margin">Eſay 36. 6.</note>, and all your ſhelter for defence, lying, falſhood, and vanitie; ſhift and ſhuffle, and flie whither you will, you ſhall not bee able to flie from his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance; though you could dig to hell (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaketh <note n="y" place="margin">Amos 9. 2.</note>) yet Gods hand would fetch you thence; though climbe up to Heaven, hee

            <p>If therfore thou deſireſt to finde mercie and comfort, Repent, be ſorrie for thy ſinnes, mourne that thou haſt diſpleaſed and offended God, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thinke of his judgements, doe thy beſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour to prevent them: for how ſoever it ſhall pleaſe God to deale, ſuch and ſuch only ſhall bee moſt happie. And ſo much for the ſecond Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. It followeth.</p>
            <p>The third Doctrine is, That Gods faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants <note place="margin">3. <hi>Doct.</hi>
               </note> are verie powerfull with God, and as his deare favourites, by their prayers, to prevent and turne away judgments and calamities, from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and Gods people. This Doctrine I raiſe from the word <hi>(Pagarg)</hi> which ſignifieth to reſiſt, or withſtand, as <hi>Ierome</hi> tranſlateth it <note n="*" place="margin">

               <note n="z" place="margin">Iudg. 8. 21.</note>; and is, by metaphor, frequently aſcribed unto prayer; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Gods ſervants uſe an holy force and violence unto God, in their deprecations; which thing alſo our Engliſh tranſlation ſignifieth, Doe not <hi>(intercede)</hi> which is properly a Latine word, and ſignifieth to come betwixt <note n="*" place="margin">Inter &amp; cede.</note>; and ſo to let, hinder, withſtand, or prohibit the doing of a thing. As if God had more plainly ſaid, according to the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall and Tranſlations, I am purpoſed that this people ſhall be carried into Captivitie, and doe not thou by thy prayers come betwixt me and them, to let, hinder, withſtand, or reſiſt mee. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine thus naturally and properly raiſed, is well fortified and backed by many other, both poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and exemplarie Scriptures. The Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Confirmation</note> complaining of the great want of prayers, doth it in this forme, <hi>There is none that calleth upon thy name, that ſtirreth up himſelfe to take hold of thee</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Eſay 64. 7.</note>. Firſt, obſerve how in times of greateſt need, Gods <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi>
               </note> ſervants may be ſo dull, as to have need of ſtirring up, like unto that elegant metaphoricall decompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite of the Apoſtle unto <hi>Timothie, Stir up the gift of God.</hi> The graces of God being like fire, muſt ever and anon be ruſſled and ſtirred up, elſe will grow cold, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. Oh ſtirre up your ſelves.</p>
            <p>Secondly, being ſtirred up by prayers faithfull and fervent, men lay hold on God: And againe, <hi>I ſought for a man among them, that ſhould make up the hedge, and ſtand in the gap before me, for the land, that I ſhould not deſtroy it</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Ezech. 22. penult.</note>. Our Saviour ſpeaketh of offering violence to the Kingdome of Heaven,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3489:31"/>
and the violent taking it by force <note n="d" place="margin">Matth. 11. 12.</note>; wherein prayer hath a ſpeciall part; for woe were it with many, if bodily ſtrength carried it away, but the pooreſt and weakeſt Chriſtian ſicke in bed, and ſcarce able to breathe, yet by ſighes and groanes may offer violence, and take Gods kingdome by force: and <hi>S. Paul</hi> beſeecheth the Romanes, <hi>For the Lord Ieſus Chriſts ſake, and for the love of the Spirit, that they would ſtrive with him in their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God for him</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 15. 30.</note>. He would have them pray, but not coldly and negligently, as the Papiſts mumbling and tumbling over their beads, when their mindes are wandring about earthly occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but hee would have them ſtrive with God, and put all their ſtrength to it; yea, to ſtrive to the ſhedding of bloud, as <note n="*" place="margin">

To this purpoſe, ſweet are the ſentences of ſome of the Fathers. An ancient one ſaith, When prayers joyne together in devotions, they doe (as it were) even band themſelves together to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter God <note n="*" place="margin">Quaſi manu fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta Deum ambiunt orantes.

Loe, loe, the incomprehenſible mercie and loving kindneſſe of God, towards ſuch as truly feare and ſerve him, making them in his goodneſſe, in his bottomeleſſe goodneſſe (I ſay) ſo powerfull and mightie with him, that their prayers are as it were bands to tie

his hands, and as a wall againſt him, that hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not execute his anger (though moſt juſtly deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) unleſſe they will ſuffer him, and (as it were) ſtand out of his way. How may the conſideration hereof make us exclaime, <hi>O Lord, what is man, that thou art mindfull of him, or the ſonne of man, that thou regardeſt him</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Pſal. 8. 4.</note>! or (as <hi>Iob</hi> hath it) <hi>That thou doeſt ſet thine heart upon him, Iob</hi> 7. 17.

Take a few, ſelected out of many, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. When <hi>Iacob</hi> ſoreſaw deſtruction threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to himſelfe, and wives and children, by his cruell and bloudie brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> comming out againſt him with 400. men, then ſaith the Text, <hi>was Iacob greatly afraid and diſtreſſed, and falleth to prayer unto God for deliverance;</hi> yea, and with that fervencie, that hee is ſaid <hi>to wreſtle with God, and told him hee would not let him goe, till hee had bleſſed him</hi>

            <p>The ſecond reaſon hereof, is Gods owne free <note place="margin">2.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3489:34"/>
and Kings, that have ſet their love upon them, as the leaſt of Gods Saints may doe with the Lord: for if earthly Kings be exceedingly offended, favourites muſt give way, <hi>Hamans</hi> face muſt be covered, he ſhall never ſee the Kings face any more <note n="f" place="margin">Heſt. 7. 8.</note>: But though God be angry, and have muſtred his Armies, yea and beſieged, and battered, ſo powerfull are Gods ſervants, that they can ſtand up in the breach, and by their praiers turne away threatned judgements. Oh who would not be ſuch a Kings favourite! who cannot deny any thing, which is for his glory, and their true good? The more I thinke on this, the more I am aſtoniſhed, that man, poore, miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man, weake, ſicke, diſeaſed, vile and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in his owne eies, deſpiſed of others, yet ſhould be ſuch a favourite to the King of Kings: Oh the free mercy and love of God!

            <p>This being ſo, when the ſinnes of a people are full, and when the Lord is purpoſed to bring a judgement upon a people, hee commonly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth way thereunto. As an earthly King purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to doe a thing which he knoweth is diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to his favourite, who would hinder him in it, will make way, by ſending him out of the way, or forbidding him to ſpeake, or ſome way taking him off: So the Lord, ſometimes by taking to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <note place="margin">1.

            <p>Or if he ſuffer them to live, he reſtraineth them from praier, as here he did our Prophet; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked <hi>Samuel, How long wilt thou mourne for Saul, ſeeing I have reiected him from reigning over Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>

            <p>As then it is a moſt comfortable thing to ſee godly men to live, and to ſee men zealous in preaching, praying, and ſerving God; as when a ſtorme commeth, to ſee all men betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their tacklings, as the Prophet ſaith, to ſtirre up them ſelves to lay hold on God: ſo is it a fearefull thing to ſee the righteous taken away by death; or ſuch as have beene zealous, to become cold, careleſſe, and negligent, ſet all at ſix and ſeven, let others care whom it doth more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, and ſo poſt it over from one to another.

only threatned to our ſelves, and in fearefull meaſure executed, ſpecially on our brethren in other Countries; let us practiſe this Doctrine, ſtirre up our ſelves, by moſt humble, hearty, and devout praiers, to lay hold on God, and as it were reſiſt him in his courſe, and not let him goe till his indignation be overpaſt. Doe you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe your ſelves the ſervants of God, and will you not doe this? Doe you beleeve, God will heare your praiers, and yet will yee not pray? Oh be not wanting to your ſelves, and to the Church of God in this! In ſome things, Kings and Princes may doe the Church of God good, wherein ſubjects cannot; in other things Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters may doe that good, which common Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans cannot; in other things rich men may doe that good, that poore cannot; in other things ſtrong and able men may doe that good, which weake, and feeble, and impotent cannot; yea in many things men may doe that good, which wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men cannot; but in this, all men and women, may doe alike good, by praier for the good of Gods Church: What can we doe more eaſily, or more fruitfully? It may be we have not ſilver, gold, food, raiment, but none ſo poore, (of Gods Saints) as have not praier. If we were rich, the poorer ſort are only thereby releeved, but by praier we doe good to all, even the richeſt. Againe, whereas ſome other duties, require the preſence of friends, and all of them ſeaſon and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; it is never out of ſeaſon to pray; yea there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with even in the twinckling of an eie, we may

helpe ſuch as are thouſands of miles off. Oh fie on our dulneſſe then, ſpecially the members of Chriſt <note place="margin">Reprehenſion.</note> (to whom we cannot otherwiſe doe good) ſo greatly ſtanding in need hereof, that we ſhould ſo ſeldome and coldly, (if at all) helpe them with our praiers; ſpecially God ſo calling upon us for it, and giving ſuch comfortable aſſurance we ſhall be heard. If an earthly Prince ſhould make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation <note place="margin">Simile.</note> to all his ſubjects, that if they would come to the Court, and make ſuit, they ſhould all of them have Lordſhips, houſes, lands, mannors, offices; imagine what riding and running there would be; how would they thinke him moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to beg his bread, yea to ſtarve through want, if he would not goe and aske? But that the King of heaven hath commanded us to pray, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, whatſoever good thing we ſhall aske in his Sonnes name, according to his will, we ſhall have it, for this life preſent, or a better hereafter, for our ſelves or others; and we ſee how well others have ſped, yea our ſelves have had great experience of Gods goodneſſe in this kinde: and it may be God hath cut us  and others ſhort, and threatned much evill, and all becauſe he would provoke us to pray, as delighting to be importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and wreſtled with: Yet all this will not ſerve to provoke us ſo to pray as we ought.

            <p>Oh where are theſe friends? Why doth the Church of God ſuffer ſo much evill? Why doth ſhe lie open to the execution of ſuch fearefull judgements? Becauſe Gods faithfull ſervants give way, and doe not ſtand in the breach for her, to reſiſt God. There was a curſe, yea a bitter curſe, laid upon the inhabitants of Meroz, becauſe they did not helpe the Lord againſt the mighty, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 5. 23.

Lord is in armes, that doe not by their prayers helpe the poore weake Church againſt God: that doe not lay hold on him and reſiſt him, but ſuffer him to cruſh and deſtroy. The greateſt victories and deliverances that ever we read of, were obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by faſting and prayer, yea ſeldome, if ever, was the Church in any trouble and danger, and delivered, but it was procured by prayer: and ſurely it is not without divine providence and grace, that Gods Miniſters doe ſo labour to ſtirre you up, for even that ſheweth God hath a great bleſſing in ſtore for his Church, if his ſervants would but aske it of him. Wherefore I ſay againe, Pray, pray, pray for the welfare of Ieruſalem, they ſhall proſper that love it. Wherefore God <note place="margin">Concluſion.</note> hath ſent me to you, and to call on all that heare me this day, Pray, pray, pray, and to make you excuſeleſſe if yee neglect it. And that mine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation hereunto may bee the more waightie and powerfull, I will deliver it in the words of the holy Prophet <hi>Zephanie,</hi> our Prophets fellow-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer, who having in the firſt chapter threatned the heavie and ſevere iudgements of God againſt Iudah for her ſinnes, <hi>That the Lord would utterly</hi>

One of theſe two, or both, they ſhall be ſure to finde; and the very leſſer of them is an abundant reward, for all the labour any can take in ſeeking, God, though it were day and night. An example whereof we have in our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, who taking exceedingly to heart, the miſery of Gods people which he foreſaw, and wiſhing his <hi>head were waters, and his eies a fountaine of teares, that he might weepe day and night for his people</hi>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:3489:40"/>
and in the end God forbade him to pray for them, yet his praiers and teares were returned into his owne boſome; for as God promiſed him, <hi>Verily I will make the enemies to entreat thee well, in the time of evill, and in the time of affliction</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">Ierem. 15. 11.</note>, ſo God performed it: For <hi>Ieremy</hi> being in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon when Ieruſalem was taken, <hi>Nabuzaradan</hi> the chiefe Steward, (according to the command which <hi>Nebuchad-nezzar</hi> had given him) not only ſet him at liberty, but gave him victuals, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, with leave to goe whither he would <note n="r" place="margin">Iere. 40. 2, 3, 4, 5.</note>; ſo good a thing it is to be faithfull unto God, how ever things goe with his Church.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe grounds from Gods Word, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new <note place="margin">Concluſion.</note> mine exhortation againe, Pray, pray, pray, you ſhall at the leaſt deliver your owne ſoules.

Oh therefore that it would pleaſe God, that the Lords Miniſters could ſtirre up all the meeke of the Land, to ſeeke the Lord in repentance and praier, to ſtep up into the breach, intercede, and reſiſt God, I would not doubt, but as to ſee judgements paſſe over us, ſo to ſee peace on Gods Iſrael abroad. There is helpe for Ieruſalem in her God, and when the Lord hath brought her on her knee, and clothed her with ſackcloth, for
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:3489:41"/>
her ſinnes, he will viſit the fruit of the proud heart of the King of Aſhur, and the glory of his high lookes, who doth not know, that he is <hi>the rod of Gods wrath</hi> 
               <note n="s" place="margin">Eſay 10. 6, 7.</note>. The ſtripes of Ieruſalem ſhall be healed, but the wounds of Babylon are incurable, there is no Balme in Gilead for her; Ieruſalem may be ſhaken, but it is Babylon ſhall fall, and never riſe againe: Oh then pray, and pray heartily, for the welfare of Ieruſalem, and then <hi>ſtand ſtill, and ſee the ſalvation of God</hi> 
               <note n="t" place="margin">Exod. 14. 13.</note>, who hath meanes that we ſee not, to accompliſh his act, his ſtrange act, and to bring to paſſe his worke, even his ſtrange worke <note n="u" place="margin">Eſay 28. 21.</note>.</p>

            <p>And here give me leave (upon ſo juſt occaſion) <note place="margin">Reprehenſion.</note> to reprove the unthankfulneſſe of the world, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſuch, as, under God, are a ſingular meanes of our preſervation. Never were <hi>Noah,</hi> or <hi>Lot,</hi> more mocked, ſcorned, and derided, than the godly in theſe daies, diſgraced, and loaded with all indignities, as the men unworthy to live in the world; who if they humble their ſoules with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and put on ſack cloth, they that ſit in the gate ſpeake againſt them, and the drunkards make ſongs of them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.

how Italy hath beene harrowed and brought to deſolation by the fire and ſword of barbarous Nations, the Goths, Hunnes, and Vandals, and made the Theater of moſt lamentable Tragedies, Hiſtories doe report. In places where enemies are up in Armes, chariots and horſes are in great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; and when enemies beſiege, there is great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard had to the wals; if they have breaches made in them, and none to defend, or fall downe flat (as the wals of Iericho did <note n="z" place="margin">Ioſh. 6. 20.</note>) thoſe Cities muſt needs be ſurpriſed: Now good men are as the wals of the Common-wealth, City, or Towne, where they dwell; if it were not for them, the judgements of God would breake in, and deſtroy them. How are ſuch to be eſteemed? <hi>Noah</hi> was as a wall to the old world, and no ſooner in the Arke, but the floud came and deſtroyed them all. <hi>Lot</hi> was as a wall to Sodome, and no ſooner in Zoar, but fire and brimſtone fell and conſumed them all. The Chriſtians were as the wall to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and no ſooner in Pella, but Ieruſalem was ſurpriſed and ſacked. No ſooner had <hi>Ioſiah</hi> his eies cloſed, that he might not ſee the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but be taken to reſt, as God had promiſed, but ſtraightway the wofull tragedy of Iudah and Ieruſalem beganne. Wherefore the Prophet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth, that good and mercifull men are taken away, and men doe not take it to heart <note n="a" place="margin">Eſay 57. 1.</note>, as a great loſſe, and fearefull prognoſtication of evill.</p>
            <p>For concluſion, ſeeing Gods ſervants are ſo <note place="margin">Concluſion.</note> powerfull with God, and that only by praier, and <hi>we doe not know how to pray, as we ought ourſelves,</hi>

God convert, or confound, the enemies of his Church and Truth; even theſe, uttered, not for forme, faſhion, vſe, cuſtome, but fervently, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, are moſt excellent and powerfull praiers; yet herein we are not to reſt, but to ſeeke after a growth in this, as in other graces of the Spirit, and never to ceaſe begging of God, till in good meaſure, according to the Scripture phraſe, even in the language of Canaan, we be able to expreſſe our owne wants, and the wants of his Church; and in his owne words, to crave ſuch bleſſings and graces, as we, or his people, doe ſtand in need of; Standing in the breach, with his owne wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, of gracious Covenant, and Promiſe, and Oath, in one hand, and urging his owne Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of truth, grace, glory.

            <p>
               <hi>For I will not heare thee.]</hi> It is very common <note place="margin">Senſe.</note> in the Scriptures of Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to promiſe and threaten, the grant or deniall of mens praiers, in this forme of hearing or not hearing. One place of Scripture (ſelected out of a great multitude) may ſerve for proofe of this: <hi>Wee know that God heareth not ſinners: but if any man be a worſhipper of God, and doth his will, him he heareth</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Ioh. 9. 31.</note>. So then, the meaning (of <hi>not hearing)</hi> is, God will denie what the Prophet ſhould thus begge of God. If the Prophet (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his charge) ſhould make his ſuit unto
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:3489:44"/>
God, to ſpare his people, and preſerve them from captivitie, hee would not heare, hee would not grant his deſire; he ſhould but ſinne againſt God himſelfe, and doe the people no good; God was now unchangeably reſolved, <hi>Iudah</hi> ſhould into captivitie, as well as their brethren the ten Tribes; he was reſolved to caſt them out of his ſight, as he had done the whole ſeed of <hi>Ephraim;</hi> and it were bootleſſe for the Prophet to pray againſt this, which he ſignifieth thus, <hi>I will not heare thee</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Non ego exau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diam.</note>. Indeed it is true, that the judgements of God are commonly conditionall, as God himſelfe hath <note place="margin">Prevention.</note> ſaid, <hi>At what time I ſhall ſpeake concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdome, to plucke up, to pull downe, and deſtroy it; if that nation againſt whom I have pronounced, turne from their evill, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of the evill which I thought to doe unto them</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">Ierem. 18. 7, 8.</note>. And in threatnings, ſometimes the condition is expreſſed, as divers times God threatneth his people thus; <hi>If ye walke contrary to me, and will not hearken unto me, I will puniſh you ſeven times more</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="margin">Levit. 26. 18, 21, 24.</note>. Sometimes the condition is not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but neceſſarily underſtood, as when <hi>Ionah</hi> threatned <hi>Ninivie, Yet fortie dayes, and Ninivie ſhall be deſtroyed</hi> 
               <note n="k" place="margin">Ionah. 3. 4.</note>; the fortie dayes came, and <hi>Ninivie</hi> was not deſtroyed, God changed his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will, becauſe the concealed condition was kept, for <hi>Ninivie</hi> repented, and therefore muſt not be deſtroyed. Yea the ſame judgement which at the firſt threatning may be conditionall, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards may become abſolute, and unavoidable; as the deſtruction of <hi>Sodome</hi> was at the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:3489:44"/>
threatned, and therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> ſo farre prevailed with God, that if there were but ten righteous perſons found in it, he would ſpare them for thoſe tens ſake <note n="l" place="margin">Gen. 18. penult.</note>; but that condition fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, it was in the next place abſolutely threatned, the Angels ſaid to <hi>Lot; The Lord hath ſent us to deſtroy this City, and we will deſtroy it</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Gen. 19. 13.</note>. It might be the caſe of this people: if when Gods ſervants <note place="margin">Application.</note> reproved them for their ſinnes, and threatned them with captivity, they had repented in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth and aſhes, peradventure the Lord would have heard them, and repented of the evill: But ſeeing they would not be reformed, but grew worſe and worſe, and unto all their other ſinnes, adding this crying one, of evill entreating, yea moſt ſhamefully abuſing Gods ſervants, who dealt faithfully with them, to bring them to the ſight of their ſinnes and repentance; honouring and eſteeming none but the falſe Prophets, who preached peace, and pleaſing things: God is now reſolved to bring a heavie judgement, even the ſword of the enemie upon them, and to give them over into captivity, revealeth this purpoſe to his Prophet <hi>Ieremy: The Land ſhall be deſolate, the earth ſhall mourne, and the heavens above be blacke; I have ſpoken it, I have purpoſed it, and will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, neither will I turne backe from it</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">Ierem. 4. 28.</note>. Yea to make it (if it were poſſible) more ſure, he told him, <hi>He had ſworne by himſelfe, that houſe (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ſo truſted) ſhould become a deſolation</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">Ierem. 22. 5.</note>. And to adde yet more waight thereunto, expreſly forbiddeth the Prophet to pray, cry, or make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion

fearfull thing to fall into the hands of God.</p>
            <p>And verily (if we had grace) the remembrance <note place="margin">Vſe.</note> hereof would be a notable bridle, to reſtraine us from ſinne, if when Satan tempteth us, and wee are in danger of falling, wee would ſay as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did to his impudent miſtreſſe, <hi>How ſhall I commit this great ſinne againſt God</hi>

Would not God heare his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ieremie,</hi> no nor <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Samuel, Noah, Iob,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> though praying for his owne people, but caſt them off, a prey to the peſtilence, famine, and ſword?

            <p>The ſecond reaſon, is for declaration of his <note place="margin">2.

Church, neither doe the true Miniſters of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell now take upon them to foretell, wherewith, when, and how the Lord will puniſh the ſinnes of a people; yet aſſuredly the providence of God is wonderfull, to direct them in their miniſterie, what texts of Scripture to handle, what Doctrines to raiſe, what promiſes or threatnings, comforts or reproofes, to uſe.</p>

And ſo much for the maine reaſons, why ſometimes God will not be intreated to the contrary, but will puniſh a people, <hi>viz.</hi> The declaration of his juſtice, and truth, that he may be feared, and beleeved, when by his ſervants he doth threaten.</p>
            <p>It now followeth according to my propoſed <note place="margin">3. The ſinnes.</note> method, to declare what ſinnes they are, which then did, now doe, and for ever will, ſo provoke God, and exaſperate him, that he will not ſpare; and namely what were the ſinnes, which brought this miſerable and inevitable captivity upon this people, and which threaten the like judgement, whereſoever found. And therein two things are to be conſidered, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſinnes for their kindes; and the meaſure or proportion of them. What their ſinnes were, will appeare from the Prophets ſent unto them, to reprove them, and threaten their captivity, which were, our Prophet, <hi>Ezechiel, Nahum, Zephany, Habacuck,</hi> and <hi>Ioel</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> fore-notes on the ſmall Prophets, cap. 11.</note>. Wherefore from their Propheſies only, and ſpecially of thoſe two great and worthy Prophets, I will gather light to this purpoſe, and from them prove what
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:3489:51"/>
I ſhall deliver. And that I and you, may the more orderly proceed, and better remember them, I will range them in certaine rankes.</p>
            <p>As firſt, the ſinnes of the Prieſts, and then of the people: the ſinnes of the Prieſts, either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <note place="margin">Method.</note> of their Miniſtery, or converſation: the ſins of the people, were either the greater, as againſt the firſt Table; or leſſer, as againſt the ſecond Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The laying open of theſe things, will both declare the juſtice of God, who would not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to ſpare ſo ſinfull a people, and alſo admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all people to beware of ſuch ſinnes, for feare of a like judgement.</p>
            <p>And firſt note, that judgement beginneth at Gods Sanctuary <note n="z" place="margin">Ezech. 9. 6.</note>. And no marvell; for there beganne the corruption of all ſorts of men <note n="a" place="margin">Ierem. 23. 15.</note>. The Prophets did moſt reprove, and cry out againſt the Prieſts, who in their Miniſtery, firſt, <note place="margin">1. For Miniſtery.</note> were blinde and ignorant. It is true, they were wonderfully conceited of their learning and <note place="margin">1. Ignorant.</note> knowledge, and like enough they had a great meaſure (at leaſt ſome of them) of worldly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and humane learning; but they rejected the word of the Lord, and then what wiſdome was in them <note n="b" place="margin">Ierem. 8. 8, 9.</note>? Whereby it appeareth, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <hi>the Prieſts lips ſhould preſerve the knowledge of God</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Malac. 2. 7.</note>; and God made his Prophets Seers, and Watchmen, to preſerve the people from judgements to come, by declaring their ſinnes, and directing them in the waies of God; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the captivity, they generally rejected the word of God, and were ſimple, without any power
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:3489:51"/>
to tell the people of their ſinnes, or give direction what courſe to take, whereby to prevent enſuing judgements. Secondly, they dealt falſely in their <note place="margin">2.

               <note n="d" place="margin">Ierem. 23. 22.</note>. And the Prophet bewaileth this fault: <hi>Thy Prophets have not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered thine iniquity, to turne away thy captivitie</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Lament. 2. 14.</note>; <hi>but gave themſelves to ſerve the time, and pleaſe men, flattering, and ſaying, peace, peace</hi>

And if any one dealt more faithfully with the people, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſinnes, and labouring to touch their conſciences, and to humble them, that ſo they might prevent the judgement (as <hi>Ieremy, Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel,</hi> and ſome others did) thoſe wicked Prieſts and Prophets were angry, and aſſured the people, they did but terrifie and diſcourage them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe; all was well: Yea that falſe Prophet <hi>Hananiah,</hi> tooke away the yoke (which by Gods command <hi>Ieremy</hi> did weare, whereby to ſignifie their captivity) and brake it, &amp; propheſied falſely. <hi>Thus within two yeeres, will God breake the yoke of Nebuchad-nezzar King of Babylon</hi>

being carnall and earthly minded: <hi>From the leaſt to the greateſt, every one was given to cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe; and from the Prophet to the Prieſt, every one did deale falſely</hi>

Now before the captivity, they heaped all manner of diſcontents, diſcouragements, and diſgrace, upon them: they would not heare them, or elſe it was but to talke of them, when they came home, as one that had a pleaſant voice, and could ſing well <note n="a" place="margin">Ezech. 33. 31.</note>: if they reproved them for ſinne, or threatned them with judgement, they regarded it no more than winde <note n="b" place="margin">Ierem. 5. 12, 13</note>; but ſaid, <hi>evill ſhall not come upon us, we ſhall neither ſee ſword nor famine</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Ierem. 5. 12, 13</note>. They did but mocke, and deride, and reproch him for his Miniſterie <note n="c" place="margin">Ierem. 20. 7, 8.</note>; his owne countrey-men of Anathoth threatned him, to preach no more unto them, in the name of the Lord; for if he did, he ſhould die by their hands <note n="d" place="margin">Ierem. 11. 21.</note>: yea at another time, when he had in a publike and great aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, delivered what he had received from the Lord; <hi>Prieſts, and Prophets, and all the people, caught him, and ſaid, Thou ſhalt die the death</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Ierem. 26. 8.</note>. They grievouſly ſlandered and accuſed him, as a man that diſcouraged the people by his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:3489:53"/>
and weakned the hands of the men of warre, and ſought not the wealth of the people, but their hurt; and therefore the Princes beſought the King to put him to death <note n="f" place="margin">Ierem. 38. 4.</note>: his enemies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired againſt him <note n="g" place="margin">Ierem. 11. 19.</note>; and his owne familiar friends watched for his halting <note n="h" place="margin">Ierem. 20. 10.</note>; yea they did ſinite and impriſon him both <note n="i" place="margin">Ierem. 20. 1.</note>, and much endanger his life with the filth of the priſon; for he did ſticke faſt in the mire <note n="k" place="margin">Ierem. 38. 6.</note>; which made him ſo bitterly to complaine: <hi>Woe is me, my mother, that thou haſt borne me a man of ſtriſe, and a man of contention, to the whole earth: I have neither lent nor borrowed an uſury, yet every one of them doth curſe me</hi>

Thus have you ſeene the great corruption that was in the Prieſts and Prophets generally, both in regard of their Miniſtery, and converſation; and how the people behaved themſelves, both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the good and bad. Now let us ſee what was the generall condition, and the ſinnes of the people. As, to beginne with ſuch as were grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt:</p>
            <p>Firſt, they were ignorant of God, as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth: <note place="margin">1. Ignorance.</note> 
               <hi>My people is fooliſh, they have not knowne me; they are ſottiſh children, and have no underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; they are wiſe to doe evill, but to doe good, they have not knowledge</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">Ierem. 4. 22.</note>: yea they were more
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:3489:53"/>
blockiſh and ſenſleſſe, than the bruit creatures: <hi>For the Storke of heaven knoweth her appointed times; the Turtle, Crane, and Swallow, obſerve the time of their comming, but my people know not the iudgement of the Lord</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">Ierem. 8. 7.</note>.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Atheiſme; they profeſſed, <hi>The Lord</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. Atheiſme.</note> 
               <hi>hath forſaken the earth, he ſeeth not</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">Ezech. 9. 9.</note>. Neither was this the ſinne of the common people onely, but the Princes, like Atheiſts, <hi>deviſed miſchiefe, gave evill counſell, mocked the threatning of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and ſaid, Iudgement was not neere, they might build houſes</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">Ezech. 11. 2.</note>. Yea King <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> himſelfe, like an Arch-Atheiſt, having heard ſome of <hi>Ieremies</hi> Propheſie read unto him, <hi>he cut the roule in peeces, with a pen-knife, and caſt it into the fire, and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">Ierem. 36. 23.</note>.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, foule and groſſe Idolatry; both pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, in the houſes of their imagery, in the darke; <note place="margin">3. Idolatry.</note> 
               <hi>God let his Prophet, through an hole in the wall, ſee ſeventy of the Ancients worſhipping Idols</hi> 
               <note n="s" place="margin">Ezech. 8. 8.</note>; and alſo publike, <hi>On every hill, and under every greene tree playing the harlot; ſaying to a ſtocke, thou art my father, and to a ſtone, thou haſt brought me forth</hi> 
               <note n="t" place="margin">Ierem. 2. 20. 27.</note>: <hi>yea in the Cities of Iudah, and ſtreets of Ieruſalem, offering cakes to the Queene of heaven, and powring out drinke offerings to other gods</hi> 
               <note n="u" place="margin">Ierem. 7. 18.</note>; <hi>yea they ſet their abominations in the houſe, which is called by my name, to defile it</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Ierem. 32. 34.</note>. See how Idolatry groweth, from chambers, to hils; from hils in the Country, to ſtreets in the Cities; yea into the Temple. This was that ſpirituall whordome, which all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets with open mouth cried out againſt: and no
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:3489:54"/>
marvell; for as a man will beare with much fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe and unkindneſſe in his wife, but by no meanes will endure her to commit whordome; ſo God will beare with many ſinnes in his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but cannot endure Idolatry, ſpirituall whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and adultery; that never eſcaped heavie pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the taking of Gods name in vaine; <note place="margin">4. Taking Gods name in vaine.</note> hearing the word but of faſhion, cuſtome, or ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter reſpects. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>their eare is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed, they cannot hearken; behold, the word of the Lord is to them a reproch, they have no delight in it</hi> 
               <note n="x" place="margin">Ierem. 6. 10.</note>.</p>
            <p>Adde hereunto their ſoule hypocriſie, whereby <note place="margin">5.

Is this houſe become a denne of robbers in your eies? behold, I have ſeene it, ſaith the Lord</hi> 
               <note n="y" place="margin">Ier. 7. 9, 10, 11.</note>. And he told his Prophet <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> the people would ſay one to another; <hi>Come, let us heare what is the word that commeth forth from the Lord: and they come and ſit before thee, and heare thy words, but they will not doe them: for with their mouthes they ſhew much love, but their hearts goe after their covetouſneſſe</hi> 
               <note n="z" place="margin">Ezech. 33. 30.</note>. And againe, <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous Iudah hath not turned unto me with her</hi>

               <note n="a" place="margin">Ierem. 3. 10.</note>.</p>
            <p>Prophanation of the Sabbaths, another ſinne cauſing their captivity, and much reproved and
threatned, by the Prophets of God <note n="b" place="margin">

            <p>

Moreover, the land was <hi>full of bloudie crimes</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Ezech. 7. 23.</note>, <note place="margin">7. Murther.</note> by reaſon of murder, man ſlaughter, quarrelling, fighting.

               <note n="d" place="margin">Ierem. 5. 7.</note>? Yea this was ſo common a ſinne, that he called them <hi>all, adulterers</hi>

            <p>Likewiſe they did oppreſſe, defraud, and wrong <note place="margin">9. Oppreſſion.</note> one another, by falſe weights, and meaſures, and devoure one another by cruell uſurie, and unjuſt gaine, and did even <hi>ſet traps and ſnares to catch men</hi>

And when Gods Prophets did moſt threaten ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and they ſhould have humbled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſackcloth and aſhes; loe, then did they <note place="margin">11. Pride in apparell.</note> moſt give themſelves to gariſhneſſe, tricking, pranking, and painting themſelves, in ſcorne of God. Wherefore the Lord threatned them, that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:3489:55"/>
he would <hi>puniſh the Princes, and Kings children, and all ſuch as were clothed with ſtrange apparell</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">Zeph. 1. 8.</note>. Alſo they gave themſelves to maintaine exceſſe <note place="margin">12.

               <note n="m" place="margin">Hab. 2. 15.</note>.</p>
            <p>Moreover, they were moſt unthankfull for <note place="margin">13.

               <note n="n" place="margin">Ierem. 5. 24.</note>. Neither did they amend by gentle corrections: the Prophet <note place="margin">14.

Thou haſt ſtricken them, but they have not grieved; thou haſt conſumed them, but they have refuſed to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rocke, they have refuſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">Ierem. 5. 3.</note>. Loe, theſe are the maine linnes which reigned in <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> before their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie; which God ſent his Prophets to reprove and threaten; but all in vaine, for they did truſt, becauſe they had the Temple and worſhip of God, no evill ſhould happen unto them; and therefore anſwered their threatnings, with theſe words of vaine confidence, <hi>The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord.</hi> Wherefore the Lord aſſured the Prophet, he would caſt them out of his ſight, they ſhould goe into captivitie, and he <hi>would doe to that houſe, wherein they ſo vainly truſted, as he had done to Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loh in the dayes of their forefathers</hi>

As theſe were their ſinnes for kinde, ſo had they <note place="margin">2.

            <p>Secondly, that we are at this time nothing ſound, <note place="margin">2. A ſinfull people.</note> but all ſwellings and ſores, a ſinfull nation; and loaded with iniquitie. You have heard what were the ſinnes of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> doe you not

Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall with reverence and conſcience, reade the writings of thoſe worthy Prophets, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our times thereto, ſhall finde, they doe ſo lively picture out the iniquities of our daies, as if they had beene ſent unto us, and had propheſied againſt us; and therefore their writings are ours, either to admoniſh us, and turne us away from all our evill waies, and to prevent the like judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; or to make our condemnation the more juſt, and our plagues the more terrible, if in his juſtice he ſhall execute them upon us.</p>
            <p>It may be, ſome exception may be taken againſt <note place="margin">Prevention.</note> one ſinne, and indeed one of the greateſt; <hi>viz.</hi> that we cannot be charged with Idolatry, as <hi>Iudah</hi> was. I anſwer, it is true, (God be bleſſed) that Romiſh Idolatry, is, by our Chriſtian and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Lawes, ſuppreſſed, and his Excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, both by peereleſſe labours, and exquiſite writings, hath throughly diſcovered the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, and by godly Edicts and Proclamations, advanceth pure Religion to the utmoſt; wherein the Lord enable him to perſiſt, that he and his may be bleſſed for ever. Amen. But give me leave to make a few Quaeres. Have we not too many Chemarims, Seminaries, Prieſts, and Ieſuites, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing to Baal? Have we not too many that ſweare by the Lord &amp; Malcom, as all our Church-Papiſts, that profeſſe religion in Gods houſe, and

have alſo their cloſe chambers of Imagerie at home? Is not the number of Idolatrous Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants greatly increaſed, even ſince that moſt hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh powder-treaſon, (for which no name can ever be deviſed able to ſet forth the nature of it) which a man would have thought would have beene the bane of Poperie thorow the world; it being a fruit of their Religion, and practiſe of their poſitions and principles: oh, how fearefull, that Idolatrie (even ſince that time) ſhould ſo increaſe!</p>
            <p>Thirdly, as we have many enemies, ſo are they <note place="margin">3.

greaterthan <hi>Iohn,</hi> who was alſo greaterthan any of the Prophets <note n="t" place="margin">Matth. 11. 9, 11.</note>; thereby declaring to all the world, how unwilling he is to enter into judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with us, of all other people, though wee have provoked him, above all people profeſſing his holy and heavenly truth: and to this end, whereas his hand is ſo heavie on our neighbours, he ſendeth us his Miniſters unto you; as on the one ſide, both to ſet your ſinnes before your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whereby you anger him, and the meanes how to pacifie and appeaſe him, that he may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually continue a good God to you and yours; ſo on the other ſide, to threaten you, that he will make you a ſpectacle of wrath and miſery to all people, (as he made Ieruſalem) without ſpeedy and unfained repentance.</p>

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:3489:57"/>
Yea, that which is worſe than all this; are not the <hi>Ieremies,</hi> and <hi>Ezechiels,</hi> ſent unto them, hated, mocked, ſcorned, and derided, and even loaded with malicious ſlanders, as the vileſt men on earth, and not worthy to live?</p>
            <p>Who ſo blinde as ſeeth not theſe things? and <note place="margin">Concluſion.</note> who ſo ſimple as from them cannot conclude; therefore ſurely, God muſt needs be avenged on ſuch a Nation, unleſſe we repent ſpeedily, and whilſt there is time, we all meet him with entreaty of peace. Oh England, at the laſt, know the time of thy viſitation, and awake out of thy deepe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; watch, faſt, and pray.</p>
            <p>But I foreſee, many objections will be made againſt this concluſion. As firſt, ſome (like the <note place="margin">1. <hi>Obiection.</hi>
               </note> proud Phariſie <note n="y" place="margin">Luk. 18. 11.</note>) may ſay, I thanke God, I am not an Atheiſt, Idolater, blaſphemer, murtherer, adulterer, nor ſuch a ſinner as you have named, and reproved, out of the Prophet; therefore I need not ſo take things to heart, and humble my ſelfe; I ſhall eſcape well enough.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, though thou werteſt as juſt, and <note place="margin">Sol.</note> righteous, as thou braggeſt for, yea as righteous as <hi>Noah, Iob,</hi> or <hi>Daniel;</hi> yet thou knoweſt theſe ſinnes doe every where reigne, and abound, and thou maiſt be wrapped in a generall judgement. The Scriptures afford us memorable examples, of great and generall judgements, procured by the ſinnes of ſome few; and indeed, all make but one body; <hi>quilibet homo eſt pars communitatis;</hi> and the ſinnes of the wicked, are in ſome ſort the ſins of all them, where they dwell; but ſpecially their
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:3489:58"/>
open and knowen abominations. If thou ſeeſt an Atheiſt, Idolater, a murtherer, a drunkard, and doſt not to the uttermoſt of thy power, ſeeke to ſtop and reforme the ſame; or if that way thou canſt doe but little, yet if thou doſt not mourne in thy ſoule, to ſee Religion thereby diſgraced, God diſhonoured, and his anger kindled, and doſt not pray to God for pardon; how juſt ſoever thou art in thine owne perſon, yet thoſe ſinnes are in ſome ſort thine, and the judgements temporall may wrap thee in them.</p>
            <p>Let it never be forgotten, that when <hi>Achan</hi> had <note place="margin">Confirmation</note> ſtollen the excommunicate thing for which God was angry, and <hi>Ioſhuah</hi> lamented, ſaying; <hi>Oh Lord God, what ſhall I ſay, when Iſrael turneth their backs, before their enemies?</hi> God anſwered, <hi>Iſrael hath ſinned, and they have alſo tranſgreſſed my covenant; they have taken of the accurſed thing, and have ſtollen and diſſembled, and have put it even amongst the ſtuffe</hi> 
               <note n="z" place="margin">Ioſh. 7. 8.</note>. See how God challengeth, and puniſheth all Iſrael for <hi>Achans</hi> ſinne: and at his execution, <hi>Ioſhuah</hi> asked him, <hi>Why haſt thou troubled us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh Lord! if this were remembred and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, it would juſtly cauſe a great deale of feare, to <note place="margin">Concluſion.</note> ſee or heare, of the ſinnes of the Land or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, much more of the City, Towne, or Pariſh, wherein we live; and therefore how innocent ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we thinke our ſelves, let us be grieved for the ſinnes of others, and labour to prevent ſuch judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as may juſtly wrap us in them: of which more was ſaid, from the ſecond Doctrine; this being ſaid to be one of the reaſons, why the godly
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:3489:58"/>
are ſo exceedingly affected, when they perceive his anger, and heare his threatnings.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſay ſome, we ſee ſuch as are profeſſed <note place="margin">2. <hi>Obiection.</hi>
               </note> Idolaters, and moſt corrupt in doctrine, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane in converſation, in whom all the forenamed ſinnes doe reigne, yet live, and thrive, and proſper in the world: why ſhould we then be ſo affected for our ſinnes?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, That ſmall ſinnes, of ſuch a people <note place="margin">Sol.</note> as have entred into league and covenant with God, and have received the knowledge of his truth, and make profeſſion of his feare, are more grievous and diſpleaſing unto God, than great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions of profeſſed Atheiſts and Idolaters. God is more offended with the ſinnes of Iudah and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, than ten thouſand times greater in Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon. <hi>If his children obſerve not his Lawes, nor keepe his Commandements, he will be ſure to viſit their offences with the rod, and their ſinnes with ſcourges</hi>

            <p>I beſeech you, remember this; No ſinnes ſo diſpleaſing, and provoking God, as the ſinnes of <note place="margin">Exhortation.</note> his people, for whom he hath done moſt, and who profeſſe moſt: <hi>You only have I knowne of all the families of the earth, therefore I will puniſh you for all your iniquities</hi>

               </note> ſelves, that God will never ſuffer them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, This is it ſo offended the Prophets, <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and made them ſo to expoſtulate the matter with God; as our Prophet, <hi>Righteous (O Lord) art thou when I plead with thee: yet let me talke with thee of thy iudgements.

               <note n="n" place="margin">Hab. 1. 13,</note>? Whereby it appeareth, the Prophet had a great combat in

himſelfe, to thinke that the Babylonians, more wicked and ungodly, ſhould ſo proſper, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure the Iſrael of God; as no doubt but it trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth many, that the Papiſts, ſuch Hereticks, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, bloudie men, and generally moſt prophane, that they ſhould ſo devoure the Proteſtants, more righteous than they.</p>
            <p>But let Gods children humble themſelves; it is <note place="margin">Vſe.</note> juſt: and let not the enemies boaſt; for their day is comming.

Oh, the conſideration of theſe things makes many an one ſo ſecure, that no warning fro heaven or earth, word or works, of mercie or juſtice, will doe them good, but they proceed from evill to worſe, as though no hurt could come unto them.</p>
            <p>But give me leave: as I doe moſt unfainedly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <note place="margin">Sol.</note> the great mercies of God, ſo I would plucke away theſe pillowes from under their el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowes, whereupon they ſleepe in ſecurity.

            <p>Now to come to ourſelves, that we may make <note place="margin">Vſe.</note> good uſe of all that hath beene ſpoken and heard.

As a great Argument to perſwade me ſo, it is, <note place="margin">Argument.</note> that God doth both ſtirre up many his faithfull ſervants, by word and writing, preaching and Printing, publikely, privately, and every way they can, to provoke men and women to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and alſo for that we ſee, men and women generally, to take to heart the afflictions of their brethren, and to helpe them with their praiers, and purſes, and every way they can: yea, me thinketh, in all places I ſee a quickning of zeale and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a commendable care to ſeeke the face of God in his holy Ordinances, both publikely and privately: Every where, more thankfulneſſe for our peace, and the bleſſed day of viſitation. Oh, the ſanctified uſe of their troubles, is a ſweet aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that our ſins are not full, but the Lord will be our protector ſtill, and doe great things for us.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the Ieſuit (ſeeing his fellowes and the Romiſh Catholikes could not ſwallow us up <note place="margin">Exhortation.</note> quicke, as they intended in the gunpowder-plot, yet to keepe life in them, that they may with good hope, hold on in their deuilliſh plots and devices, againſt us) doth propheſie, ſaying; The ſinnes of <hi>England</hi> will ſhortly be full <note n="*" place="margin">Veniet tandem iniquitatis comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum.</note>.

            <p>I have armed at no mans perſon, or particular <note place="margin">Concluſion.</note> calling. Only as one of Gods ſervants, deſiring to be faithfull, and free from the bloud of all men, I have ſet Trumpet to my mouth, and according to that ability I have received, laboured to ſtirre up all ſuch as have heard me, to the practiſe of ſpeedy and unfained repentance. This hath beene the maine end of all my diſcourſe, which now by Gods good hand I have finiſhed. If it worke that effect in many, if in any, I have my deſire; if but in one, if in none but my ſelfe, my labour is not loſt in the Lord. I ſhall be found a ſweet ſavour unto God, even in thoſe that periſh; and at the leaſt ſave mine owne ſoule. And ſo, to his bleſſing, from whom I have received it, I doe commend it.</p>
