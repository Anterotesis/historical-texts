            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41424:4"/>
ſome in the prime of their years, and all in perfect health, and the midſt of their ſtrength; to ſee ſo many able Bodies ready to drop into the Grave: But above all, it ſhould ſtir up our utmoſt Commiſeration, to conſider ſo many Souls, for whom Chriſt died, (without his infinite interpoſing Goodneſs) juſt ſinking into the Dwellings of Everlaſting Miſery.</p>
            <p>And indeed ſad is the State, deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Condition you have brought your ſelves to; adjudg'd by the Laws of your Countrey, and by them accounted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy any longer to live, unworthy to tread this Earth, or breathe this Air; and that up further good, no other benefit to Mankind can be expected from you, but only by the Example of your Death; and to ſtand like Marks on fatal Rocks, and Sands, to warn others from the ſame Ruin for the future. And may the Miſery, and publick Shame you are expoſed to, make a better impreſſion on others, than
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41424:4"/>
the like Puniſhment of others has made on you. For 'tis the aggravation of your Iniquities, that you have been full proof againſt Warnings of all kinds; not only the frequent Sufferings of others, for Crimes of the ſame nature, who were deſign'd for <hi>your examples, to the intent you ſhould not have luſted after evil things as they alſo did;</hi> but doubtleſs, nay certain it is, that many of you have had a good Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, tender Mothers, that wept, and prayed for you; and careful Fathers and Maſters, that kindly withſtood you in your evil Courſes; admoniſh'd you of your Duty to God, and often gave you that Advice which you then diſdain'd, and thought irkſome and uneaſy to hear, but now remember, and with regret of Soul wiſh you had attentively liſten'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, but all in vain; <hi>For becauſe you their hated knowledge, and did not chuſe the fear of the Lord; becauſe you refuſed counſel, and deſpiſed all manner of reproof, therefore you muſt now eat of the fruit of your own ways; and be fill'd with your own devices; for the</hi>

               <hi>turning away of the ſimple ſhall ſlay them, and the proſperity of fools will in the end deſtroy them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though your Circumſtances are ſo truly lamentable, <hi>though the wickedneſs of your heels has encompaſt you about, and you are ready to fall into the pit, which by your Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities you have dug for your ſelves; though you are tied and bound with the chain of your ſins, and are ſo faſt in priſon that you cannot get out,</hi> but to an evil and ſhameful Death; though, I ſay, your Condition is every way ſurely able to excite the utmoſt pity, and imploy our Eyes more than our Tongues, yet we come not here ſo much to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile, as to inſtruct you; and that your departure hence may not be to you <hi>the beginning of true ſorrows,</hi> may not conſign you over to a doleful Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, is the End and Deſign of this Diſcourſe, by perſuading you carefully to make uſe of the few remaining mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments allotted to you, to lay them all out with the utmoſt of your power, in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41424:5"/>
bringing, in forcing your ſelves to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; that your paſt Offences, by the infinite Mercy of God on your ſhort, but ſincere Endeavours, may be done away; and the patient and humble Reſignation of your Bodies to the Sufferings you have deſerved, be accepted in Chriſt Jeſus, and tend to the Salvation of your Souls: <hi>Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Diſcourſing on which Words, I ſhall (as I have a great deal of reaſon now to do) proceed with caution, purſue the beſt and ſafeſt method, and that, which in your diſtreſs'd Circumſtances, appears moſt profitable for you; and that, I think, is this:</p>
            <p>Leſt you ſhould any way deceive your ſelves in this your great and laſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, as to the nature or degree of that <hi>Repentance</hi> which God requires in order to eternal Salvation, I ſhall in the</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:41424:6"/>
1ſt. Place endeavour to detect and lay open to you, the many Errors and Miſtakes men uſually run into in relation to this Duty: And to every one of theſe I ſhall add an Application very ſuitable for you to lay to Heart.</p>
            <p>2dly. I ſhall in plain and expreſs terms ſhew you what the Duty of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is, to which ſo valuable a Bleſſing as Forgiveneſs of Sins is annex'd; and an infinite, unvaluable Bleſſing 'twould be to you, becauſe without it you muſt in a very little time become Everlaſtingly Miſerable. Of theſe in the order pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
            <p>And the firſt Error I ſhall take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, is not properly concerning the Nature, but the Original of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; from whence, or from whom it comes, but yet an Error of a very pernicious conſequence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:41424:6"/>
For moſt People, at leaſt the Actions of moſt, ſuppoſe Repentance to be purely and perfectly in their own power, and that they may begin it when they pleaſe; and therefore though it is daily offered unto them by Almighty God, and preſs'd on their Conſciences by the good Motions of his Holy Spirit, yet they every day refuſe it, and go on in gratifying their Luſts and evil Affections, and delay their Repentance from day to day, becauſe they think that while Life laſts, they may take it up when they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>But all this is downright deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a wilful miſapprehenſion of things of the greateſt moment; for ſure enough it is, that Repentance is not in our own power, but is merely a Gift of God; and ſuch a Gift as may, and is often forfeited by an ungrateful rejecting and refuſal of it; and God is the God of them that Repent, not
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41424:7"/>
only becauſe he offers it to us, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe without his Grace we cannot effect it. We have ever ſince the Fall a backwardneſs in our Nature to all Good, and a readineſs to all Evil; and without the immediate Aſſiſtance of Heaven, <hi>We can never ceaſe from that evil, or learn to do that good; we can do nothing of our ſelves, 'tis God alone that enables us both to will and to do: His Grace indeed is ſufficient for all things;</hi> but if we abuſe that Grace, it may be taken from us, and never offer'd to us again; for there is abundance of truth in that known and ancient ſaying (which ſo nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns you), That though Repentance be never too late before God when it is true, yet it ſeldom happens to be true when it is ſo very ſlow and late; and that God who has promiſed Pardon to the Penitent, has no where promiſed the Grace of Repentance to thoſe that continually turn their backs upon it, and wilfully neglect the Opportunities of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:41424:7"/>
This part of my Diſcourſe then, is to beg you ſeriouſly to reflect on the fatal Exigences you are now involv'd in, by ſo long, and ſo ungratefully reſiſting the Grace of God; which, without that reſiſtance, would have led you to Repentance; and to loſe no part of your ſhort time, <hi>but to cry aloud for that Repentance, and ſpare not;</hi> and do not expect cheaply to get that which you have ſo much undervalued and deſpiſed; <hi>but return unto the Lord your God with uninterrupted weeping, and faſting, and mourning; and rent your hearts, and turn unto him with all your hearts; and who knows but he too will then return and repent, and yet pour down the bleſſing of converſion upon you?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But 2dly. The next great Error that I ſhall mention is, when we take a part of the Duty, and a very ſmall part too, for the whole: Thus moſt men reſolve to believe it conſiſts in a bare Sorrow and Remorſe for Sin. But how
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41424:8"/>
widely does he miſtake the true nature of Repentance, that thinks it only Grief and a ſelf-reprehenſion for having done ſomewhat amiſs? How unjuſtly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out equity does he confine and impriſon it? For if this were Repentance, we need not perſuade men to it, 'tis impoſſible for them to forbear it, and there would always be juſt as many Penitents as Sinners.</p>
            <p>For Actual Sin is ſuch a ſhock and force on right Reaſon, ſuch a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to that inward ſtanding Principle of Conſcience, which Almighty God has Mercifully implanted in the breaſt of every Man, that as nothing but want of due conſideration can be the parent of wickedneſs, or put us upon doing it; ſo on the leaſt reflection afterwards, eſpecially when our Sins have taken ſuch hold upon us, that they have conſign'd us over to Puniſhment, we muſt ſenſibly know, <hi>that 'tis an evil and a bitter thing to depart from the living God.</hi> We muſt of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41424:8"/>
courſe, and with grief wiſh our Sins un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>committed, as naturally as the Mad-man does diſlike the ſad effects of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive fury when his fit of Frenzy is over, and the ſober interval come.</p>
            <p>And therefore now when you are juſt a going to reap the fruit of your paſt Iniquities, when the allurements of thoſe Wickedneſſes, that brought you hither, have loſt their Charms, and you ſee them as they are in themſelves, and not under their former deceitful appearances, when the World and all things in it has thus diſcarded and flung you off; 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that in this caſe you ſhould retire into your ſelves, and caſt a Melancholy look both backwards, and forwards; backwards on the Actions of your paſt Life; and forward on your future Eternal condition, depending on thoſe Actions; and with grief and ſorrow, ſnay with bitter ſighs and tears, reflect on what you have done amiſs, and where you have dealt Wickedly; for this is as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41424:9"/>
as Rains and Storms in Winter; and without a frozen benumm'd Stupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, 'tis impoſſible it ſhould be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
            <p>What judgment then of a future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition can here be given? Who in ſuch Circumſtances (beſide God himſelf) can ſeparate or diſtinguiſh the acts of ſincere Repentance, from the natural horror and anguiſh that does ariſe from Sin? Who can ſay this is Divine, this Human? This proceeds from a due ſenſe of Sin, and ingratitude to a Merciful God, a Compaſſionate Redeemer, a Bleſſed Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier, and not from the ſervile fear of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Puniſhment?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God knows it wounds my very Spirit within me, to ſpeak theſe things to you, but 'tis for your Salvation that thus I ſpeak;</hi> and therefore put not too great a confidence in your preſent ſorrow, do not too ſpeedily call it a ſign or effect of Repentance, but try your ſelves to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41424:9"/>
the utmoſt; and reſolve to bring your ſelves to this frame of mind, that you would not only grieve, (which is nothing elſe but Paſſion) but be alſo active and willing to do any thing to gain your God; and that you would rather dye for your ſins, than live in them. But Thirdly,</p>
            <p>The next Miſtake which I ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to you, lies in this; If to our grief and ſorrow for ſin, we add Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of avoiding it, and to theſe join Reſolutions of obedience for the future, then we are ſure we are got into the very heart and center of Repentance, and that all the Benefits belonging to it, cannot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much wrong, or injury, be denied us; but alas! the wrong is not done to the Man, but to the Vertue, if we aſſign it no larger a ſphere to act in.</p>
            <p>If indeed we leave Sin before temptation, and the opportunity of Sinning has left us; if we depart from Iniquity before it brings us to puniſhment, and <hi>Chriſtianly</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:41424:10"/>
fence our ſelves againſt it, by Vows and Promiſes, by Reſolutions and Ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the contrary, this, I confeſs, looks as if we were in earneſt with God and our own Souls; but yet even here, 'tis time only can tell us whether we are ſo or no: For as reſolute as we appear now, our old Sins may in a little while get the dominion over us: 'Tis true, <hi>God, who is the ſearcher of hearts, and the trier of the reins,</hi> and who ſees all things at once, which Men by degrees draw out into action; knows on what motive we go, at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment we reſolve, and the ſtrength or weakneſs of our Reſolutions; but 'tis Time only can ſhew us to our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Hence the Promiſes that are made when the fear of the <hi>Grave</hi> is upon us, and the <hi>Righteous Tribunal</hi> almoſt in our view, are juſtly liable to ſuſpicion, and ſeldom laſt longer than the Occaſion of them; and nothing is more ordinary, than to ſee the moſt Profligate Sinner, when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the apprehenſion of Death, very ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41424:10"/>
for his paſt Sins, and making the higheſt Proteſtations, That if God would but ſpare him, he would become a new Creature; and yet to think that all who do this, go to Heaven, is certainly an Opinion the moſt deſtructive to <hi>Practical Chriſtianity</hi> that can poſſibly be invented.</p>
            <p>I doubt not, but you who have been ſo very ſollicitous to urge your Friends to mediate for your Pardons, have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times applied your ſelves to God, though, I'm afraid, not with the ſame fervour and concern; and, I believe, you have made many Vows of a better life, if life had been lengthen'd to you, but the date of that is almoſt run out; and therefore here you may behold the imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of your Condition, in the impoſſibility that lies on you to know or try the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of your hearts in the performance of this part of Repentance (for a part of Repentance I allow it to be). You may indeed make Reſolutions, but you have not time to prove your ſelves as to the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41424:11"/>
keeping of them; without which, all Reſolution is nothing but Fallacy and Deceit; nay, without queſtion, your own Hearts can dictate terrible things to you on this account. Have not many of you made former Reſolutions as ſtrongly, to appearance, as you can do now? and yet you have broke them; and 'twas the breach of them that brought you hither: Believe not then your own ſelves too much; truſt not your Hearts, too apt to be deceived, and which have actually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd you heretofore in this very matter, but do every thing that ſhall be advis'd you, to take of all ſuſpicion.</p>
            <p>Freely give God the Glory, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe your Detection and Puniſhment to the Eye of his Juſtice: Sincerely take ſhame to your ſelves, and candidly lay the cauſe of your Ruin at your own door; make no trivial Excuſes, alledge no Pretences, and leave not the leaſt ſting on your Conſciences; diſcharge them to the utmoſt; and without any reſerve,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41424:11"/>
do all the whole little you can toward ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king your peace with Heaven, and then you may the better believe your ſelves, and, in your Circumſtances, have the beſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe your God in his abundant Mercy may accept of thoſe Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons you unfeignedly make, inſtead of thoſe Actions you have not time to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
            <p>And you will immediately, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any artifice or diſguiſe, cloſe with this Advice, if attentive to the <hi>Second General</hi> now to be diſcours'd on; which is in plain and expreſs terms to ſhew you <hi>what the Duty of Repentance is,</hi> to which ſo valuable a Bleſſing as Forgiveneſs of Sins is annext; and an infinite, unvalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Bleſſing it would be to you, becauſe without it you muſt in a very ſhort time become everlaſtingly miſerable.</p>
            <p>And here, not to raiſe falſe Schemes, the product of Preſumption and deceitful Hopes, let us go to the Law and the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41424:12"/>
Prophets, to Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and there we ſhall be ſure to find what true Repentance is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When the wicked man turneth away from his wickedneſs that he hath committed, and does that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſave his ſoul alive,</hi> ſays the Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 27.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that covereth his ſins ſhall not proſper; but he that confeſſes and forſakes them, ſhall have mercy,</hi> ſays the <hi>Wiſeman,</hi> Prov. 28. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bring forth fruits meet for repentance,</hi> ſays the Fore-runner of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 8. And Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down, and caſt into the fire,</hi> Matth. 7. 19. To all which agrees his Apoſtle in the Text, <hi>Repent, and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out.</hi> So that to <hi>turn away from ſin,</hi> to <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it,</hi> to <hi>bring forth fruits meet for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> to <hi>repent, and be converted,</hi> are equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent Terms, and mean the ſame thing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41424:12"/>
in the ſtyle of the <hi>Holy Scriptures:</hi> And the reaſon that God himſelf, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 28. gives for his pardoning a Sinner, is not becauſe he grieves, or reſolves, but becauſe he conſiders, (that is, upon mature deliberation) <hi>turns away from the tranſgreſſions that he has committed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From all which places (and a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of others to the ſame purpoſe) it will inevitably follow, That Repentance is the ſolid change of our Life; not a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation in words or Tears only, but a practical retracting our former evil ways, a leaving and forſaking our trade, and courſe of ſinning, and <hi>living righteouſly, ſoberly, and godly in this preſent world:</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is properly an habit, not a few doleful wiſhes of amendment, forc'd from us by the imminent danger our Sins have meritoriouſly plung'd us in.</p>
            <p>For when our Iniquities, by a firm cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, are become familiar to us; and adopted into our very Temper; when we have for a long time given up our
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41424:13"/>
ſelves into the full and intire poſſeſſion of them, and acted them with all manner of greedineſs; tis unreaſonable to ſuppoſe they can be conquer'd by a few ſingle Acts, or fearful Reſolutions of the mind; we may as well believe our ſelves capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of apprehending the moſt intricate, of doing the moſt difficult things at firſt ſight; we may on as good grounds expect to remove a Chronical Diſtemper, and tear up all the Seeds of it, with one Doſe of Phyſick; or at once to change the frame and turn of our Bodies, grown up with us, to move ſwiftly and regularly backward, or on a ſudden to alter any other ſetled ſtate or poſture we have been accuſtom'd to from our Infancy, as to think our ſelves with careleſs ſpeed, and eaſe, able to break down the ſtrong-holds of Sin, or looſe thoſe perplext cords of Wickedneſs ſo often thrown about us. No, this muſt be the effect of much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and thoughtfulneſs, of great ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and contending, of fervent Prayers, and repeated Petitions to the Throne of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41424:13"/>
Grace, and we muſt exert the whole force and power of our Souls, before we can any way hope to accompliſh it. And therefore no miſtake has drawn a longer train of Evils with it, or produc'd more unhappy conſequences to the Souls of men, than the common Opinion that poſſeſſes moſt Chriſtians, and perſuades them that Repentance is a ſudden and momentary Act, which begins and is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected on the Mind in an inſtant; 'tis this weakens every Argument for a Good life, and makes people leave all things of the other World, to the laſt periods of their abodein this, and then they uſually call for help, and ask, <hi>What they ſhall do to be ſaved?</hi> 
               <q>When in their own Conſciences they know they can do ſcarce any thing at all; and then muſt One come, and as they call it, ſpeak Comfortably to them; that is, Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter a little Divinity Stupefaction; which like the intoxicating Potion given to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Malefactors, will render them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of their approaching Execution, and of the Wrath that is to come.</q> Whereas
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41424:14"/>
there is not the leaſt ground for this fancy in Holy Scripture, but the direct contrary is there aſſerted to us. The Query here is not, Whether on a ſudden or at the laſt hour, God can convert, or turn a Sinner from the <hi>evil of his ways;</hi> no doubt he can do that as eaſily as Create him at firſt; as we may ſee in the Quick Converſion of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and Speedy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of St. <hi>Peter</hi> (whoſe Sin was Unpremeditated and of little continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and therefore was the ſooner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton'd for): But the main Queſtion is, Whether this is the ordinary method of God in bringing us to Heaven? and that it is not, the whole ſtream and intrinſick deſign of the Goſpel ſufficiently declares. And methinks nothing can more plainly demonſtrate this, than the conſideration of what our Saviour lays down in the Fourth of St. <hi>Mark</hi> at the 26th, 27th, and 28th Verſes, as a manifeſt deſcription of the uſual Operation of the Bleſſed Spirit of God on the Souls of men; <hi>And he ſaid, So is the Kingdom of God; as if a man ſhould</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:41424:14"/>
               <hi>caſt ſeed into the ground, and ſhould ſleep, and riſe night and day, and the ſeed ſhould ſpring and grow up he knows not how; for the earth bringeth forth fruit of her ſelf, firſt the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear, and then cometh the harveſt.</hi> Where evident it is, That our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from Sin to Holineſs, our progreſs from Vice to Vertue, is no haſty head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long courſe, but a deliberate regular journey, paſſing from one ſtage to another, till <hi>we become perfect men in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The growth of our Mind in Goodneſs, is like that of the Body in Stature, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible at firſt to thoſe that daily look on, but in a little time apparent to all.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour gives us the Knowledge of his ways, and Grace to walk in them; he ſowes the ſeed of his Word in our Hearts (the proper Soil for it) and then leaves it to our management, as the Husbandman does his Seed to the Ground; and if there be no defect in the Soil, if we
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41424:15"/>
permit the good Word to fix in our Hearts, and add our Care and Induſtry to the Dews and Showers of the Holy Spirit, and the Warmth and Influences of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, it will then <hi>take root downward</hi> and <hi>bear fruit upward,</hi> it will proceed from one degree to another, till the Crop kindly comes to full ripeneſs and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>And therefore Chriſtianity is often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a Walk, to denote Steadineſs and a conſtant gradual Progreſs; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to Running, Fighting, and Striving, to urge our Zeal and Fervour in the Chriſtian Courſe; but it never ſuppoſes unnatural Starts, a violent Tranſition, or a precipitate Turn from one thing to another; but Conviction always goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Converſion, and is followed by a regular proceedure from <hi>ſtrength to ſtrength, from grace to grace, till in due time we come to the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt.</hi> And we have no inſtance, I think, in the whole Scripture to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41424:15"/>
unleſs you imagine that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to be one, who, as himſelf affirms, <hi>found mercy becauſe he ſinn'd through ignorance:</hi> Or the Thief on the Croſs, who is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by all to cloſe with Chriſt at his firſt Call, and own him for his Saviour, when he ſaw him under the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation with himſelf, and derided or deſerted by every one beſide, even by his own Apoſtles. Neither of which is any thing near, but very ſadly different from your Caſe, who have reſiſted a Thouſand of his Calls, and known and own'd him <hi>in Words, but in your works de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now upon a ſhort review of what has been ſaid, we muſt Firſt aſſert, That Repentance is not in our own Power, but is a Gift from God, which may be forfeited by an ungrateful reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or refuſal of it; And how often has he offer'd this Gift to every one of you? And how unkindly have you refuſed it? How then can you expect it again? Or
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41424:16"/>
ſhould he out of his unwearied pity, once more, in this needful time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, vouchſafe to ſtretch it out to you, How ſhould you with wonder and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment at his Mercy lay hold on it? And therefore whatever goood Motions of Reſtitution, Confeſſion, of giving God the Glory, or taking Shame on your ſelves; whatever Motions of this kind deſcend into your Hearts, ſtifle them not, as you have too long perniciouſly done, but receive them with gratitude, follow their guidance exactly, and look upon them as the laſt trial, the utmoſt effort of the Bleſſed Spirit for your Repentance and Salvation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We muſt affirm, That Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is more than a bare Sorrow for Sin; for 'tis often a meer natural effect of Miſery to make men let go every falſe hold, lay down their Pride, drop their Security, and with Fear and Tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling come to a knowledge of themſelves, and there may be little or no Religion in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41424:16"/>
all this; and therefore if any of you are without this leaſt, this loweſt mark of Penitence, 'tis the height of Stupidity; and let me with ſorrow tell you, That a careleſs deportment in your Condition, argues a ſtiff Neck, an hard Heart, a ſear'd Conſcience, inſenſible of Wrath, and incapable of Mercy.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We muſt be forc'd to aver, That even Vows and Reſolutions are only the beginnings of Repentance, and if not ſincere, are not ſo much as that; for our Saviour came not to fright us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to good Reſolutions, but to convince us of the happineſs, ſafety, and neceſſity of Goodneſs, the neceſſity of beginning it ſoon, leſt we have not time to perfect it; and here therefore I muſt once more remind you of the Injury you have done your ſelves; you have cut off all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of knowing whether your Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ſincere or no; nothing but time (ordinarily ſpeaking) can ſhew that to any one but God; and your
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41424:17"/>
own time, the thread of your life, you have abruptly broke aſunder by the weight and violent courſe of your Sins; and therefore not only reſolve, but faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully do every thing to unweave the web of your Iniquities, to appeaſe and reconcile your ſelves to your Offended Maker, ingenuouſly inquire <hi>What you ſhall do to be ſav'd?</hi> and carefully fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Inſtruction, and think nothing to hard, that is maturely advis'd you to approve the ſincerity of your Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and Laſtly. We muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that Repentance (the Condition of Eternal Salvation) is properly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the ſolid change of our Life, not a Recantation in Words, or Tears, or Wiſhes only, but a practical retracting our former Evil Ways, and living <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, ſoberly and godly in this preſent world;</hi> and if ſo (as without all perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture ſo it is) to what a miſerable uncertainty of Salvation are you then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd?
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41424:17"/>
for how can you be ſaid to live a good Life, when you are juſt a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? How can you be ſaid to finiſh your Chriſtian Courſe, when you have ſcarce time to begin it? You left not Sin, but Sin has left you (if it has indeed left you); for your Evil Deſires (as far as we can judge) are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, or chang'd for the better; but are only beat down, and ſtunn'd at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching ſight of Death; you cannot give any convincing Proof of your Enmity to Sin, or Obedience to God, you can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſh you had obey'd; and 'tis not good Wiſhes, but good Actions, that muſt carry us to Heaven: God forbid I ſhould exclude you thence; and God forbid but I ſhould tell you, That 'tis no eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, under your Circumſtances, to get thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the Way is narrow, and you have made it narrower by your Tranſgreſſions; the Gate is ſtrait, and you have made it ſtraiter; nay almoſt clos'd it up by the multitude of your Offences, and your obſtinate continuance in them:
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41424:18"/>
And therefore ſeek diligently, ask im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately, and knock without ceaſing, that it may be opened unto you; do not too much fear Deſpair, but fear Preſumption, and groundleſs Hopes of Future Happineſs; willingly retain Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and Anguiſh with you, they are the moſt decent Company for you to appear in; will do moſt good on others, and ſooner lead you to Heaven, than the bold miſtaken Pretences of Peace and Aſſurance: Exerciſe every Act of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation. Be always converſant with your God, and always meditating on the odiouſneſs of Sin, and the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of your Saviour for it. Loſe no part of the ſhort time allow'd you to prepare for Eternity.</p>
            <p>Gratify no ſuperfluous Bodily Deſire, though never ſo innocent; eat the Bread, drink the Water of Afflicton; wholly regard your better, your Immortal Part, and remember whatever the Condition of that is, your Body too muſt ſhare
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41424:18"/>
in it; and therefore ſpare no pains, but kneel, and weep, and read, and watch, and faſt, and pray, and uſe your utmoſt endeavours, that you may not enter into Eternal Condemnation.</p>

            <p>The word of God plainly tells us, <hi>That the end of ſin is ſhame and deſtruction,</hi> Phil. 3. 19.

            <p>And if we look into the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we ſhall find frequent mention of an <hi>acceptable time,</hi> and of <hi>a day of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> which we are earneſtly advis'd on no account to let ſlip.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:41424:21"/>
Thus ſays <hi>David</hi> to God, <hi>Pſal. 69. 13.

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41424:22"/>
ſpace of time, in which ſome of the Children of Men ſhall not be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in which they ſhall not be ſuccoured, at leaſt from the Temporal Calamities they are under, though they never ſo pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly intreat for it, and in which God will not be found of them though they diligently ſeek him; this the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> calls <hi>a time of the great water-floods,</hi> in which they ſhall not come near him; when the overflowing of Sin and wrath as a mighty ſtream and deep gulph ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe, and cut off all communication of Mercy between them and their God; thus again ſays God, <hi>Iſa. 1. 15. Though they call I will not anſwer; when you ſpread forth your hands I will hide mine eyes from you; and when you make many Prayers I will not hear;</hi> and the reaſon of this carriage of our Merciful God is moſt plainly and emphatically given in the Text, and is there ſet down as an act of juſt <hi>Retaliation</hi> towards us; <hi>Then ſhall they cry unto the Lord, and he will not hear them; he will even hide his face from</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:41424:22"/>
               <hi>them at that time, as they have behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ill in their doings:</hi> That is, though God may for ſome time ſeem to be ſlack, as ſome Men count ſlackneſs, though for a while he may ſeem to wink at the repeated Wickedneſs of ungrateful Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and appear by his ſlowneſs to Puniſh, as if he never deſigned it; yet this at laſt will be found a ſad miſtake, and a time will come, in which he will ſurely repay the deeds of the obſtinate wicked Perſon on his own head, and will then take example by him; and as he in the time of Sin ſhut his Eyes and clos'd his Ears to God, <hi>and would have none of his Counſel;</hi> ſo in the time of Puniſhment God will do the ſame to him. And 'twill not be an Objection of any weight to tell us, that theſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited places do not immediately relate to us Chriſtians, but concern the Temporal Calamity of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and do denote that they had a time of Repentance, and turning to their God allow'd them, which if laps'd by their continuance in Sin, they
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41424:23"/>
would thereby forecloſe themſelves, and make the Sentence of their Calamity irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſible: I ſay, this will be no ſolution of the caſe in hand, but rather a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right denying of the truth; for we know that all things that relate to the Practice of Holineſs, or the Puniſhment of Sin, all things of this kind that were written aforetime, were written for our Example; <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the Fleſh, was a Type of <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the Spirit; that is, a Type of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and the Profeſſors thereof; and their <hi>Canaan</hi> did prefigure thoſe Manſions of Reſt and Happineſs prepar'd for us above: And therefore whatſoever did keep them out of that good Land, or cut them off from it, the ſame, proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, will cut us off from Heaven, and caſt us into Hell; and this very thing throughout the 3d. and 4th. Chapters to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> is all along urg'd; the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel is exactly, and to a tittle carried on by the Apoſtle, and Inferences are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually drawn from thence; thus Unbelief or Diſobedience, ſays St. <hi>Paul,</hi> kept them
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41424:23"/>
in the Wilderneſs, barr'd them out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and made <hi>God ſwear in his wrath, that they ſhould not enter into his reſt:</hi> And then it follows, <hi>Let us</hi> (us Chriſtians) <hi>likewiſe fear, leſt a promiſe being left us of entring into his reſt, any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it.</hi> And what is point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blank to the purpoſe in hand, chap. 4. v. 7. <hi>Again he limiteth a certain day, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, To day if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts;</hi> and then it follows v. 11. <hi>let us labour therefore to enter into that reſt,</hi> (he means Heaven, the reſting-Place of Chriſtians) <hi>leſt any man fall after the ſame example of diſobedience or unbelief;</hi> and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1, 2. he quotes the very words of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and directly applies them to the ſtate of Chriſtianity; <hi>We then as workers together with him, beſeech you alſo, that ye receive not the grace of God in vain; for he ſaith</hi> (ſpeaking of God) <hi>I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of ſalvation I have ſuccoured thee; behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of ſalvation.</hi> So then to Chriſtians there is a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41424:24"/>
time of Salvation, a certain preſcrib'd time, in which their Repentance and ſincere En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of Obedience ſhall be accepted and crown'd with Succeſs; and the oppoſite to this muſt be ſome other portion of time, in which theſe bleſſed advantages (being wilfully overſlip'd) will not be again ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: Some period of this nature there muſt be even to Chriſtians, elſe the Apoſtle's compariſon of the limited time, would not hold good, and his laſt cited words would quite loſe their Emphaſis and Deſign, <hi>Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what the particular admeaſurement of theſe limits are, how far this <hi>day of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> reaches, and when 'twill be clos'd and ſhut up by the approach of the unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted period, is hard diſtinctly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, and I am very willing now not to inquire into it, but will paſs on to the practical Application deſigned.</p>
            <p>And 1ſt. For you that by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41424:24"/>
of God and your Superiors, are Mercifully withdrawn from the Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you were under;</p>
            <p>Remember, and always bear it in your Mind, <hi>That you have cryed unto the Lord and he has heard you; he has not hid his face from you at this time, though you have behaved your ſelves ſo</hi> very <hi>ill in your doings towards him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider your ſelves as <hi>brands pluck'd out of the fire;</hi> and regard not ſo much your Bodies deliver'd from the <hi>Grave,</hi> as your Souls preſerv'd from the <hi>nethermoſt Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Look ſtedfaſtly back on the Danger you have eſcaped, and with Tears of Gratitude in your Eyes, ſtand amazed at the Patience, Long-ſuffering, and Forbearance of your God, not tir'd out by ſo many Iniquities; and repay it not with Falſhood, and Perjury, but let ſuch Gracious uſage forcibly <hi>lead you to repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:41424:25"/>
You have, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſays, <hi>been fooliſh people, plagu'd for your offence, and becauſe of: your wickedneſs;</hi> you <hi>have been faſt bound in miſery and Iron:</hi> You have for many days <hi>ſate in darkneſs and the ſhadow of death, and been even hard at death's door.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And you have <hi>cryed unto the Lord in your trouble, and he has deliver'd you out of your diſtreſs: he has brought you out of darkneſs and the ſhadow of death, and broke your bonds aſunder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>O that you would therefore praiſe the Lord for this his goodneſs, and declare the wonders that he has done for you: that you would offer unto him the ſacrifice of thankſgiving, and tell out his works with gladneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to this purpoſe, make a careful diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction at this juncture, between Nature and Grace; between Paſſion, and the juſt ſenſe of your Duty towards God. A joyful Surprize, a glad Aſtoniſhment at your Deliverance, may look agreeably well, and much like Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41424:25"/>
may throw you with extaſie on your Knees, and make you run over all your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Reſolutions; repeat, and vow them all again to indulgent Heaven, and yet this may be nothing but the effect of that warmth of Admiration, which ſuch a ſudden turn in your Affairs will naturally produce; and which without more ſolid fuel will ſoon again expire.</p>
            <p>All the Motions of Wonder and Joy which ſeiz'd you at the firſt notice of your Reprieve, were Animal, and not Chriſtian, (for Nature will exult at the unexpected Preſervation of her ſelf): But I would have you turn them all into the right Channel; Rejoice in the Lord; fear his Juſtice, and love and adore his Infinite Mercy towards you, and improve them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the End intended.</p>
            <p>And you will do ſo, if you make this <hi>Act of Grace</hi> a new life to your Souls, as well as Bodies; if with a juſt abhorrence of your ſelves, and a deſign for the future to retract
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41424:26"/>
them, you deliberately conſider what were the beginnings of Wickedneſs, and by what progreſs you arriv'd to that heighth of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, that the Earth was ſcarce able any longer to bear you.</p>
            <p>And if any of you are accounted unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to ſtay in the Land of your Nativity, carry not your old Crimes to New Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, for God can find you out there, and puniſh you for your repeated abuſe of Mercy.</p>
            <p>Have always then in your minds the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Fruits of Sin; the ſervile Fear, Shame, and meanneſs of Spirit it betrays its Vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to; and the Temporal and Eternal Ruin that without Repentance will at length accompany it; and <hi>hear, and forbear, and do no more ſo wickedly.</hi> And ſince you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd ſuch miſerable Uſage from Vice, with a juſt diſdain forſake its Service, and for the future zealouſly ingage for Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, <hi>againſt which there is no law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Call to mind the loſt Profeſſion of your
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41424:26"/>
Chriſtianity, <hi>the Grace of God,</hi> that heaps not Wrath and Miſery on our heads, but <hi>brings ſalvation; teaching us, that denying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs, and worldly luſts, we ſhould live righteouſly, ſoberly and godly in this preſent world. Looking for that bleſſed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The neglect of this Leſſon has coſt you dear, and the practiſing of it for the time to come, is the only true Return you can make to that Merciful God, who <hi>has deliver'd your Souls from death, your Eyes from tears,</hi> and now offers his Grace for the future, to <hi>keep your feet from falling. Let the time paſt of your life therefore ſuffice to have wrought the luſts of your fleſh, when you walkt according to the courſe of this world, according to the Prince of the power of the air, the ſpirit that worketh in the children of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;</hi> for your Prayers are heard, and more days added to your Life, <hi>that you ſhould no longer</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:41424:27"/>
               <hi>live the reſt of your time to the luſts of men, but to the will of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is mercy with God,</hi> ſays the <hi>Pſalmiſt, that he may be feared;</hi> to be drawn by the cords of a man, to be won to our Duty, and melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down by loving-kindneſs, is what an ingenuous Temper can hardly withſtand; but <hi>to continue in ſin, becauſe grace has abounded,</hi> is the mark of a baſe, abject Nature, fit for nothing but ruin; and therefore ſhould you (forgetful of the Goodneſs extended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you) abandon your preſent Safety, return to your old Sins, and by them be brought into the ſame condemnation again, your Behaviour, though never ſo dejected, and full of ſubmiſſion, will not be believ'd, will move no pity, will procure no commiſeration, becauſe of your renew'd falſe and perfidious dealings with God, and your own Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now</hi> I ſhall come to the laſt and moſt deplorable Portion of my Diſcourſe, to ſpeak particularly to <hi>you</hi> that are doom'd to dye,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41424:27"/>
and to perſuade you to endeavour to behave your ſelves ſo, that though your Temporal Calamity be unavoidable, yet your God may not ſtill cover the Eye of his Mercy from you, or be deaf to your Requeſts for pity on your poor Souls.</p>
            <p>And truly, I confeſs, I ſcarce know where to begin, or how to find out words mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enough for your Condition. I am ſure if you look into your own Conſciences, every one of you can ſay, <hi>I well remember the time when thou, O God, waſt near unto me by thy Grace, and the good Motions of thy Spirit; that Bleſſed Spirit which would have been a lamp unto my feet, and a lanthorn unto my path, if I had not ungratefully turned my back upon it.</hi> But not to aggravate that which is too heavy of it ſelf, or fruitleſly lament, but compaſſionately to help you to regain the Aſſiſtance of that Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Spirit, ſo needful for you in your preſent Circumſtances; I will (if the former part of my Diſcourſe has fully bent your minds to good Counſel before it be evidently too late) endeavour to ſhew you a Glimpſe of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41424:28"/>
Mercy; tho after all my Wiſhes and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, I muſt acknowledge that there is but one <hi>whole</hi> Virtue you are now capable to practice, or ſo to practice as you your ſelves may judge of the Truth of it; but yet 'tis a Virtue that will ſupply the place of a great many others; and perhaps, by the Mercy of God, atone for the Breach of all the reſt; but if you willingly fail in this (and next to the Grace of God it depends wholly on your Will) I think you are undone for ever.</p>
            <p>And this Virtue is <hi>Sincerity;</hi> which abhors any evaſive Arts or Shifts, which excludes all Hypocriſy, all Double dealing, all feign'd Pretences, or deceiving of God or your own Souls; it admits no Mixture of Diſſimulation, or ſiniſter Aim, no relying on your own private deprav'd Judgments, but a ready unbiaſs'd Freedom of Mind to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part and lay open every thing plain and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, to be judg'd of by thoſe who ſincerely deſire to direct you to Heaven: And let me beſeech you to yield to their advice, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41424:28"/>
truſt thoſe whoſe deſire is the Salvation of your Souls, rather than thoſe who have done all they can to deſtroy them.</p>
            <p>And the Ground of this Virtue is Honeſty of Heart, Uprightneſs of Intention; and God who ſearches the Heart, and ſees into the cloſeſt Receſſes there, knows when you act from this Inward Principle, and when not, and will certainly deal with you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. And he that is ſcarce able to do any thing, and yet refuſes to do the little he can, ſullenly lies down in miſery, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly accepts of his deſtruction.</p>
            <p>But if this be not enough to ſay; as I know not what is enough to reſcue you from the blindneſs and hardneſs of heart a long train of iniquity has involv'd you in; I will yet ſpeak my mind more plainly to you (for your Circumſtances will not admit Palliation or Delay) I know no way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for you, but by abundance of Remorſe and Contrition; and that manifeſted to God, the World, and your own Conſciences, by
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41424:29"/>
Reſtitution to the utmoſt of your power; and a candid Conſeſſion, to prevent the like Evils to others, which have befallen you: And Repentance is ſcarce any thing elſe but Reſtitution, (join'd with a due Sorrow and Confeſſion) a Reſtoring to God the loſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Creature; a Reſtoring to our Wrong'd Countrey or Neighbours, what we have injuriouſly depriv'd them of; and a Reſtoring our Selves (by the Grace of God) to the firſt Dignity of our Nature, to the Purity and Holineſs, which was that Image of God in which we were created.</p>
            <p>And if you will not do this in part, in that part which you are able to do, 'tis folly to expect it in the whole; the whole you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perform, you have not time for it; a part you may do, and let me intreat you to do it freely, ſo freely, that you your ſelves may have a rational ground to ſuppoſe you would have done the whole, if you had time and ſpace to effect it.</p>
            <p>'Tis in vain, and beyond belief, to ſay you
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41424:29"/>
would do what now you can't, when you will not do what you can: I do allow you have reſolv'd to live a good life, if you had been ſpar'd; but ſpar'd you are not, and therefore can never prove your ſelves as to this; but ſomething you may do, and by it judge of all the reſt: Reſtitution to the utmoſt of your power, and Confeſſion to the Glory of God, and hindring the progreſs of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in others, is a neceſſary part of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. This you can do, and if you refuſe this, you would have certainly refus'd all the reſt, if it had been left to your choice; you would in a little time have return'd to your old Sins in ſpight of the Reſolutions which not a due ſenſe of Sin, but your preſent Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger has extorted from you.</p>
            <p>And, believe me, a Vow, or an Oath, for concealing a real Evil, is a Confederacy and League with Hell, and a Train of <hi>Satan</hi> to ſend others after you in the ſame perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Tract.</p>
            <p>Humane Nature is ſociable, and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41424:30"/>
is the life of Society; but a conjunction of ill Men, to ill Practices, is the deſtruction both of Society, and them that ingage in it; and nothing can in this Caſe free your Souls, but a generous Deſign and Deſire to break the Infernal Combination, that you may be the laſt; that no more may be ruin'd by it as you have been.</p>
            <p>And he that, tho late, yet does all he can to gain Chriſt, may not loſe him; but he that in the very view of Death, prefers Shame, or Fear, or the love of Wickedneſs, or any other Paſſion before him, will never have him; and therefore ſay and do, reſtore and confeſs every thing neceſſary to unravel thy former Wicked Life, to take off the ill effects of thy Example, to diſingage thy Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions from the Evils thou haſt brought them into, or accompanied them in.</p>
            <p>And let not the Spirit of ſlumber reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, do not willingly ſtupify your ſelves, do not (now 'tis ſo very near) <hi>put the evil day far off,</hi> by endeavouring not to think of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41424:30"/>
it, much leſs by diverting the thoughts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by any thing really ſinful, as Drink, vain Diſcourſe, or evil Company; but rather employ the ſmall remainder of your time to the beſt purpoſes, in continually proſtrating your ſelves before the Throne of Mercy, in freely owning to all the Righteous Judgment of God upon you for your former Trangreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in making your Departure hence as profitable to the Souls of Men as poſſibly you can, by beating down all pernicious vain glorious thoughts of dying bravely, as an impious World expreſſes a ſtubborn and hardened demeanor; but with much Remorſe and great Contrition, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Humility and Penitence, reſolve to reſign your Spirits into the hands of your Creator.</p>
            <p>And, O Righteous God, how ſincerely ſhould they prepare! how cordially ſhould they behave themſelves, that in a few days are ſure to appear before thee! how unfeignedly ſhould they diſcharge their Conſciences before they ſtand at thy Juſt
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41424:31"/>
Tribunal! and willingly lay down every weight of Sin that has ſo long beſet them, and which without laying down, will ſoon ſink them into the Dwelling of Everlaſting Miſery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But O Lord, thou Lover of Souls, who doſt not deſire the death, the utter deſtruction of thy ſinful Creatures, but rather that they ſhould turn from their ſins and be ſav'd: return thou, O Lord, and do not any longer hide thy face from them, when they ſpread forth their hands unto thee; aſſiſt them by thy Grace in this their extremity; make them willing and ready to be reconcil'd unto thee before they go hence and be no more ſeen; and then be thou fully reconcil'd unto them, for his ſake, and through his Mediation, who came to Bear and Atone for the Sins of the World, thy beloved Son, and our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
