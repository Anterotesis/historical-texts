            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BY the Letters from <hi>Dublin</hi> of the 29th paſt, which came in this Morning we have an account, That an Expreſs arrived there the day before from the Camp, and brought the good News; That the General, the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> and Lieutenant General <hi>Scravenmore,</hi> having paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>Shannon</hi> on the 22d very early in the Morning, with all the Horſe, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Colonel <hi>Coys</hi> Regiment and 50 out of each Regiment of Dragoons) and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>0 Regiments of Foot, taking with him 14 pieces of Cannon, and 7 days Proviſion, the reſt of the Army remaining under the Command of Major-Generals <hi>Mackay</hi> and <hi>Talmaſh,</hi> for the ſecurity of our Works on the other ſide. About 12 at Noon all our Troops drew up before the Town on <hi>Clare</hi> ſide, the Enemy playing upon them all the while from the Caſtle and ſeveral Towers both with great and ſmall ſhot, but with little Execution. About 5 the General ordered a detache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to attack the Fort near <hi>Thomond Bridge,</hi> and tho' two great Detachements ſallied out of the Town to ſupport thoſe that defended it, we carried it, and purſued the Enemy over the Bridge to the Town, and were ſo near that they were forced to draw up the Bridge for fear we ſhould have entred with them, by which means they left a great many of their men Expoſed, of whom we kill'd 700, and took 200, among which was Colonel <hi>Skelton,</hi> two Lieutenant-Colonels, 3 Majors, 5 Captains, and about 15 other inferior Officers; we took alſo 3 pieces of Cannon and 5 Colours. Soon after we poſted our ſelves in all the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Forts and Retrenchments on that ſide the Water; we loſt not one Officer of Note, and about 50 private Soldiers. The 23th, Colonel <hi>Corbet</hi> came over to us from the Enemy, and propoſed to the General the bringing over <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s and <hi>Galway's</hi> Regiments of Horſe, and out of them to make one good Regiment to ſerve Their Majeſties in <hi>Flanders.</hi> On the 24th about 4 in the Afternoon the Enemy hung out a White Flag, and beat a Parley all round the Town, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to Capitulate; and thereupon a Treaty was ſet on foot, and Hoſtages exchanged. Thoſe from the Enemy are the Lords <hi>Weſtmeath, Iveagh, Trimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtown,</hi> and <hi>Lowth,</hi> and from us the Lord <hi>Cutts,</hi> Sir <hi>David Collier,</hi> Colonel <hi>Tiffany</hi> and Colonel <hi>Pipar.</hi> Our men who were Priſoners in the Town were already ſet at Liberty, and a like number of theirs would be ſent them in Exchange. The Enemy have about 1500 Horſe who were not in the Town, but <hi>Sarsfield</hi> deſired they might be included in the Capitulation, which ſeems to be carried on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Conſent of the French Governor, againſt whom, and all the other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of that Nation the Iriſh are highly incenſed for ſhutting the Gate upon their men, and ſuffering them to be deſtroy'd as they were.</p>
            <p>The Lord Juſtice <hi>Porter,</hi> and the Lord Juſtice <hi>Coningsby</hi> parted from <hi>Dublin</hi> on the 29th paſt towards <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> to aſſiſt at the Treaty if there was occaſion, and to concert with the General the ſetling the Winter-Quarters.</p>
            <p>The Letters from <hi>Briſtol</hi> of the 3d of <hi>October,</hi> juſt now come in, ſay, that a Veſſel was newly arrived there, who came from <hi>Waterford</hi> on Wedneſday the 30th paſt, the Maſter whereof gives an Account, that two Expreſſes came in there that Morning to the Governor of <hi>Duncannon</hi>-Fort, with an account of the Surrender of <hi>Limerick,</hi> the Gariſon marching out, and our Troops marching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Place on Sunday the 27th of <hi>September.</hi> And as the Maſter terms it, the Gariſon marched out almoſt Naked, and without Arms.</p>
