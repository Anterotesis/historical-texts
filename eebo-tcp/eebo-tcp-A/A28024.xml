         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>AN
ACCOUNT
Of all the
Lord BACON'S
WORKS.</head>
                  <p>IT is my purpose to give a true and
plain Account, of the Designs and
Labours of a very great Philosopher
amongst us; and to offer to the World,
in some tollerable Method, those <hi>Remains</hi>
of his, which to that end, were put into
my Hands.</p>
                  <p>Something of this hath been done alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
by his Lordship himself; and something
further hath been added by the Reverend
Dr. <hi>Rawley:</hi> But their Remarks lay scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
in divers Places; and here they are
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48001:8"/>
put under one View, and have received
very ample Enlargements.</p>
                  <p>In this last and most comprehensive Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
I have, on purpose, used a loose
and <hi>Asiatic</hi> Style, and wilfully committed
that venial fault with which the <hi>Laconian</hi>
(in <hi>Boccalini</hi>) is merrily taxed, who had
said that in <hi>three words,</hi> which he might
possibly have express'd in <hi>two.</hi> I hop'd,
by this means, to serve the more effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>ordinary Readers,</hi> who stand chiefly in
need of this Introduction; and whose Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities
can be no more reach'd by a close
and strict Discourse, than Game can be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by a Net unspread.</p>
                  <p>For any praise upon the account of this
small Performance, it is not worth the while
to be solicitous about it. Yet sometimes,
mean Men get a stock of Reputation, by
gathering up the <hi>Fragments of the Learned;</hi>
as Beggars (they say) have gotten Estates
by saving together the <hi>Alms of the Rich.</hi>
If that falls not out here where it is not
expected, it will be abundantly enough to
me if the Inferiour Reader may have Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
and any Honour may be done to the
Memory of his Lordship, whose more <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Encomium</hi> I shall first set down, and
then annex <hi>a particular Narrative</hi> of those
Designs and Labours of his, which may be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48001:8"/>
said, not only to merit, buteven to exceed
all my Commendations.</p>
                  <p>I begin (as I said) with his Lordship's
Praise, in a more general way. And here
I affirm, with good assurance (for Truth
is bold) that amongst those few, who by
the strength of their private Reason, have
resisted popular Errors, and avanced real
and useful Learning; there has not arisen
a more Eminent Person, than the <hi>Lord
High Chancellor Bacon.</hi> Such great Wits,
are not the common Births of Time: And
they, surely, intended to signifie so much
who said of the Phoenix (though in Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbole
as well as Metaphor) that Nature
gives the World that <hi>Individual Species,</hi> but
once in five hundred Years.</p>
                  <p>It is true, There lived in part of the last,
and this, Century, many memorable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancers
of Philosophical Knowledg. I
mean not here such as <hi>Patricius,</hi> or <hi>Telesius,
Brunus, Severinus</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi> or <hi>Campanella.</hi>
These, indeed, departed from some Errors
of the Ancients, but they did not frame
any solid <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of their own. They
only spun new Cobwebs, where they had
brush'd down the old. Nay, I intend not,
in this place, either <hi>de Chart,</hi> or <hi>Gassendi,</hi>
They were, certainly, great Men, but they
appeared somewhat later, and descended
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48001:9"/>
into the depths of Philosophy, after the
Ice had been broken by others. And those
I take to have been chiefly <hi>Copernicus, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Paul</hi> the <hi>Venetian, Galileo, Harvey, Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>
and the Philosopher before-remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> who, if all his
Circumstances be duly weigh'd, may seem
to excel them all. He was by <hi>Profession,</hi> a
common Lawyer; by <hi>Office,</hi> in the <hi>Queen's</hi>
time, one of the <hi>Clerks</hi> of the Council;
in the Reign of King <hi>Iames,</hi> one of the
<hi>King's Counsel</hi> Learned, then <hi>Solicitor</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and one of the <hi>Iudges</hi> in the Knight-Marshals
Court; then <hi>Attorney</hi> General, and
one of the King's <hi>Privy-Council;</hi> then <hi>Lord-Keeper</hi>
of the Great Seal, and during the
Kings absence in <hi>Scotland, Lord Protector:</hi>
And last of all, <hi>Lord High Chancellor of
England.</hi> So that in such a Life as his, so
thickly set with Business of such Height, it
is a Miracle that all Seeds of Philosophy
were not daily overdropped, and in a short
time, quite choaked; and that any one of
them sprung up to Maturity. And yet his
prosper'd beyond those of the Philosophers
before-mentioned, though they were not
pressed on with such a crowd of secular Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Copernicus,</hi> he concern'd himself espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the Revolutions of the Heavenly
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48001:9"/>
Bodies, in reviving and perfecting the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solete
Doctrine of <hi>Philolaus,</hi> touching the
motion of the Earth, and in setting free
the Planets from those many Epicycles, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrics,
and Concentries, in which <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy,</hi>
and others had entrangled them.
And he well understood the Course of the
Stars, though he did not much study that
natural motive Power which carries them
about in their several <hi>Elliptics.</hi> The like
Remark may be made concerning Mr. <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>
who applied himself particularly to
the consideration of Magnetic Powers;
as also concerning Dr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> who inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
principally into the Generation of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
and the motion of the Heart: Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in which he made great progress,
though into the former, the help of Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopes,
would have given him further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
<note n="a" place="margin">See Dr. <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> of Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>P.</hi> 70, 71.</note>; and in both, he rather pursued
the proofs of his Hypotheses, than the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Mechanic force, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
those great Effects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Father Paul,</hi> was a more general Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher,
and the Head of a <hi>Meeting of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuosi</hi>
in <hi>Venice.</hi> He excelled in <hi>Mechanics,</hi>
in <hi>Mathematics</hi> of all kinds, in <hi>Philological</hi>
Learning, in <hi>Anatomy.</hi> In his Anatomical
Studies, he exercis'd such Sagacity, that he
made further discoveries in the fabrick of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48001:10"/>
the Eye, and taught <hi>Aqua-pendente,</hi> those
new Speculations which he publish'd on
that Subject; he found out (saith <hi>Fulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio</hi>)
the <hi>Valvulae in the Veins,</hi> and began the
Doctrine of the Circulation of the Blood:
Though there is reason to believe, that he
receiv'd the hints of it from Sir <hi>Henry Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
who himself had taken them from
Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi>

                     </note>. But, the
present state of the Affairs
of <hi>Venice</hi> so requiring, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Paul</hi> bent his Studies to
Ecclesiastical Polity, and
chiefly employ'd his Pen in detecting the
Usurpations and Corruptions of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy:</hi>
Endeavouring (so far as Books could
do it) to preserve the Neck of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick,
from the Bondage of <hi>Paul the
Fifth,</hi> who attempted to set his Foot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Galileo</hi> further improv'd the Doctrine of
<hi>Copernicus;</hi> discover'd by Telescopes, new
Stars in the Heavens; wrote <hi>Dialogues</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>System of the World,</hi> and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Local Motion;</hi> which latter is the Key
that openeth Nature. But he descended
not to the several Classes of Bodies in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the particulars contained in them,
and their respective Motions, and Uses.
Neither did he publish any thing till many
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48001:10"/>
Years had pass'd, since Mr. <hi>Bacon</hi> had form'd
and modelled in his thoughts, his larger
Idea of Experimental Knowledg. His <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereus
Nuncius,</hi> came not forth till towards
the midst of the Reign of King <hi>Iames.</hi>
And King <hi>Charles</hi> had sate some Years on
his Throne, er'e he publish'd his Dialogue
of the System of the World. Whereas
Mr. <hi>Bacon</hi> had not only publish'd two
Books of his <hi>Advancement,</hi> in the beginning
of <hi>K. Iames</hi>'s Reign, but early in the <hi>Queen</hi>'s
time, (as from his Letter to <hi>Fulgentio,</hi>
plainly appeareth) he had written his
<hi>Temporis Partus Maximus.</hi> That Book
(pompous in its Title, but solid in its Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
like a great Feather put sometimes on
a good Head piece) contained in it, though
in imperfect manner, and so far as the
greenness of his Years permitted, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Rudiments of his <hi>Instauration.</hi> The
work therefore of the <hi>Instauration,</hi> was an
Original; and a Work so vast and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
in its design, that though others
in that Age, might hew out this, or the
other <hi>Pillar;</hi> yet of him alone it seemeth
true, that he fram'd the <hi>whole Model</hi> of the
<hi>House of Wisdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In those days in which he began his
Studies, <hi>Aristotle</hi> was, in effect, the Pope
in Philosophy. The Lectures, both in his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48001:11"/>
private College, and in the publick Schools,
were generally Expositions upon <hi>Aristotle's</hi>
Text. And every Opinion, wrote by him
as his own, was esteem'd as Authentick, as
if it had been given under the <hi>Seal of the
Fisher.</hi> It was, therefore, a very singular
Felicity in a young Gentleman to see fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into Nature, than that celebrated Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher,
at whose feet he was plac'd. And
it was as happy as it was extraordinary,
that he took distaste betimes at the Vulgar
Physicks. Use and Custome in that way,
might have reconciled it to him, as it had
done to others of great Learning. For a
Philosopher is like a Vine, of which they
say, It must be set of a Plant, and not of
a Tree.</p>
                  <p>But, though there was bred in Mr. <hi>Bacon</hi>
so early a dislike of the Physiologie of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi>
yet he did not despise him with that
Pride and Haughtiness, with which Youth
is wont to be puffed up. He had a just

than that which <hi>Aristotle</hi>
himself expressed towards
the Philosophers that went
before him. For he endeavour'd (some
say) to stifle all their Labours; design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to himself an universal Monarchy over
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48001:11"/>
Opinions, as his Patron <hi>Alexander</hi> did
over Men. Our Heröe owned what was
excellent in him; but, in his Inquiries
into Nature, he proceeded not upon his
Principles. He began the Work a-new,
and laid the foundation of Philosophick
Theory in numerous Experiments.</p>
                  <p>By this Theory is not (as I conceive)
so much to be understood, that most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted,
and more narrow one, of the meer
nature and definition of Matter, Motion,
Place, Figure, Sight, Quantity, and the
like, which a Man's Reason may find out,
by a few common and daily Appearances in
Nature, or Operations of Art: But we
are to understand by it, a truer and fuller
Knowledg, of the Systeme of the World,
of the several Actions and Passions of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
in it, and of the divers Ways where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
in themselves, or by the application
of Art to them, they may be made ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to Humane Life.</p>
                  <p>Now this was a Work for a Man of a
thousand Hands, and as many Eyes, and
depended upon a distinct, and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
History of Nature. It was a way
laborious and tedious, yet useful and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
and in this, like that way of the
Snail, which <hi>shineth</hi> though it is <hi>slow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such an useful and noble Philosophy did
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48001:12"/>
our Author design, instead of the <hi>Art of
Disputation,</hi> which then generally prevail'd,
and which he compar'd to the condition of
Children who are apt for <hi>Talk,</hi> but not
for <hi>Generation.</hi> And certainly, that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
was most due unto himself which he
gave to <hi>Xenophanes,</hi> of whom he said, that
he was <hi>a Man of a vast Conceit,</hi> and that

                  <p>Easie it is to add to things already <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented;</hi>
but to <hi>Invent,</hi> and to do it under
Discouragement, when the World is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced
against the Invention, and with
loud Clamour hooteth at the Projector;
this is not an Undertaking for Dulness, or
Cowardize. To do this, argues an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive
and <hi>Sagacious Wit; A mind free</hi>
from slavish prepossession; <hi>a piercing Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
able to see through the mists of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
a great <hi>Power</hi> in the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
giving to a Man sufficient <hi>Courage</hi> to
bear up the Head against the common Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of Philosophical Doctrines, and <hi>Force</hi>
to beat out its own way in untravelled
Places.</p>
                  <p>With such Intellectual Ability, was the
Lord <hi>Verulam</hi> endow'd: And he <hi>stood on
the old Paths,</hi> and perceiv'd, the unsound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their Bottom; their intricate Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
their tendency to an useless End, or
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48001:12"/>
rather to endless Disputation; and the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Justlings and Rencounters of those who
travail'd in them: And he looked atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
round about him, and he espied a
new, and better, and larger, and safer
way; and he journey'd far in it himself;
and he left a Map of it for Posterity, who
might further pursue it; and he has been
happy in being follow'd, by Men of the
ablest Understandings, with singular suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess;
and the <hi>Societies</hi> for improving of
Natural Knowledg, do not at this day, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from his Directions, though they tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
further than Death would suffer him to
adventure.</p>
                  <p>I can, at present, call to remembrance
but one Man, who hath undervalued his
Lordship's Method; and it is the same Man
who hath libell'd the Holy Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
the Infidel <hi>Spinoza</hi>
                     <note n="e" place="margin">B. D. <hi>Spinoza</hi> in Ep. 2. ad H. <hi>Oldenburg.</hi> with op. Posth. <hi>p.</hi> 398, 399.</note>. This Man objecteth
against his Way, that it fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the very entrance of
it, through a mistake about the <hi>Original of
Error.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Lordship's Opinion is the same with
that which <hi>de Chart</hi> insisteth on, in his latter
Philosophy. Both shew that therefore Man
deceives himself, because his <hi>Will</hi> (being
larger in its desires, than the <hi>Vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:48001:13"/>
is in its Comprehensions; and hastning
its opinion of such Objects as it covets to
know, before it hath sufficiently attended
to them, and obtain'd a clear and distinct
perception of them) does cause it to yield
a blind and rash, and therefore groundless
Assent to insufficient Evidence.</p>
                  <p>His Lordship hath expressed it <hi>thus,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his better way of saying things. <q>The
<hi>Vnderstanding</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Nov. Organ. l. 1. Aph. 49. p. 44, 45.</note> is not only made up
of dry Light, but it receives an infusion
from the <hi>Will</hi> and Affections: And that
begets such Sciences as the Heart desireth.
For a Man soonest believes that which
he would have to be true. Wherefore
he rejects <hi>difficult Truths,</hi> through impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
in inquiring; and <hi>sober Truths,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they restrain his hope [or desire;]
and the <hi>deeper Natural Truths,</hi> by reason of
Superstition; and the <hi>Light of Experiments,</hi>
by reason of Arrogance and Pride, lest the
Mind should seem to be conversant in mean
and transitory Things; and <hi>Paradoxes,</hi> out
of respect to the opinion of the Vulgar. In
sum, the <hi>Will</hi> seasons and infects the <hi>Mind,</hi>
by innumerable Ways, and by such as are,
sometimes, not at all perceived.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, how, think you, doth <hi>Spinoza</hi> shew
this opinion, to be a gross and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<hi>Mistake?</hi> Why, by denying that there
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48001:13"/>
is any such thing in Man as a <hi>Will:</hi> (as if
that general name was ever used to signifie
a particular Act, and not rather to express
the general notion of that Power:) By
telling us that all Volitions are particular
Acts, and as fatally determin'd by a Chain
of Physical Causes, as any effects whatsoever
of Natural Bodies. So that we are like to
learn well, from his Philosophy, how to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
our Erroneous Assent, whilst it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us that it is necessary, and not to be mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
unless Men could have other Bodies, and
there were another Scheme of Nature.</p>
                  <p>It must be confess'd, that the Lord I
write of, was not without Infirmities, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
or Moral: And the latter of these
have made the greater Noise from the
greatness of his Fall. I do not, here, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to speak of an Angel, but of a Man:
And no Man, <hi>great in Wit,</hi> and <hi>high in
Office,</hi> can live free from suspicion of both
kinds of Errors. For that <hi>Heat</hi> which is
instrumental in making a <hi>great Wit,</hi> is apt
to disorder the attention of the Mind, and
the stability of the Temper. And <hi>High
Place,</hi> because it giveth power to Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
though no Athority to offend, is
ever look'd on with a jealous Eye: And
corrupt Men who mete by their own
Measures, think no Man can be Great, and
Innocent too.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:48001:14"/>
His Lordship own'd it under his Hand,
<note n="g" place="margin">In his Letter to King <hi>James, March</hi> 25. 1620. In the Cab.</note> that, <hi>He was frail, and did partake of
the Abuses of the Times:</hi> And, surely, he
was a partaker of their Severities also;
though they proved, by accident, happy
Crosses and Misfortunes. Methinks they
are resembled by those of Sir <hi>George Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi>
who being bound, by his Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to another Coast, was by Tempest,
cast upon the <hi>Barmudas.</hi> And there, a
Shipwrack'd Man made full discovery of
a new temperate fruitful Region, which
none had before inhabited; and which
Mariners, who had only seen its Rocks,
had esteemed an inaccessible and enchanted
Place. The great cause of his Suffering,
is to some, a secret. I leave them to find
it out, by his words to King <hi>Iames</hi>
                     <note n="h" place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shels</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. <hi>p.</hi> 19.</note>,
<hi>I wish</hi> (said he) <hi>that as I am the first, so I
may be the last of Sacrifices in your Times.</hi>
And when from private Appetite, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd,
that a Creature shall be sacrific'd;
it is easie to pick up sticks enough, from
any Thicket whither it hath straid, to make
a Fire to offer it with.</p>
                  <p>But whatsoever his Errors were, or the
causes of his Misfortunes, they are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballanc'd
by his Vertues, and <hi>will die with
Time.</hi> His Errors were but as some Excres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies,
which grow on those Trees that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48001:14"/>
are fit to build the Palaces of Kings: For
though they are not proper and natural
Parts, yet they do not very much deprive
the Body of its use and value. And, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
(to express my self by a more decent
Image, a Comparison of his own;) <q>His
Fall will be to Posterity, but as a little
Picture of <hi>Night-work,</hi> remaining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Fair and Excellent Tables of
his <hi>Acts and Works</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I doubt not but his <hi>Mechanical Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
were many. But I can call to mind
but Three, at this time, and of them I can
give but a very broken Account: And,
for his Instruments and Ways in recovering
deserted <hi>Mines,</hi> I can give no account at
all; though certainly, without new Tools
and peculiar Inventions, he would never
have undertaken that new and hazardous
Work. Of the three Inventions which
come now to my Memory, the</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First was an Engine representing the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Planets.</hi> Of this I can say no
more than what I find, in his own words, in
one of his Miscellany Papers in Manuscript.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48001:15"/>
The words are these: <q>I did, once, cause
to be represented to me, by <hi>Wires,</hi> the
motion of some <hi>Planets,</hi> in fact as it is,
without <hi>Theories</hi> of <hi>Orbs,</hi> &amp;c. And it
seemed a strange and extravagant Motion.

themselves in <hi>Spires backwards:</hi> One while
they made larger Circles, and higher;

And yet, it should seem to be a secret of
high value by the Reward, it is said to
have procured. For the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> (as
he in his <hi>Extract. pag.</hi> 17. reporteth) when
Mr. <hi>Bacon</hi> had made a Present of it to him,
was pleas'd to be very bountiful in his
Thanks, and bestow upon his <hi>Twicknam-Park,</hi>
and its Garden of Paradise, as a
place for his Studies. I confess, I have not
Faith enough to believe the whole of this
Relation. And yet I believe the Earl of

to Profuseness; that <hi>he was a great lover of

Beams of the Sun, on purpose that
the warmth distill'd into them through the

the affection of the Heart, by a visible
sign of their Attraction and Appetite to
each other, like the hand of a Watch,
within ten Minutes after they are laid on
a Marble Table, or the Theatre of a great

many are extant, and some are lost, in

                  <p>His <hi>Abecedarium Naturae,</hi> is in part lost,
and there remaineth nothing of it besides

the Fragment, lately retrieved, and now
first publish'd. But this loss is the less to
be lamented, because it is made up with
advantage, in the second and better thoughts
of the Author, in the two first Parts of
his Instauration. The World hath sustain'd
a much greater loss in his <hi>Historia Gravis &amp;
Levis,</hi> which (I fear) is wholly perished.
It is true, he had gone no further than the
general Delineation of this Work; but
those Out-lines drawn by so great an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,
would have much directed others, in

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48001:17"/>
and if it had been preserved, it might have
delighted and profited Philosophical Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
who could then have seen the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of that great Work, as it were from
the first Egg of it.</p>
                  <p>Of those Works of the Lord <hi>Bacon's</hi>
which are <hi>Extant,</hi> some he left imperfect,
that he might pursue his Design in others;
<hi>As the New Atlantis:</hi> Some he broke off
on purpose, being contented to have set
others on-wards in their way; as <hi>The Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of a Holy War.</hi> In some he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by Death; as in the History of
<hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth. Of some he despaired;
as of the <hi>Philosophia Prima,</hi> of which he left
but some few Axioms. And lastly, some
he perfected; as some parts of the <hi>Great
Instauration.</hi> And amongst all his Works,
that of his <hi>Instauration,</hi> deserveth the first
place. He thought so himself, saying to
Dr. <hi>Andrews,</hi> then Lord Bishop of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi>
                     <note n="t" place="margin">In Epist. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic. before his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement touching a holy War.</note>, <q>This is the Work, which, in
my own judgment, <hi>(Si nunquam fallit
Imago)</hi> I do most esteem.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this Work, he designed to take in
pieces the former Model of Sciences; to
lay aside the rotten Materials; to give it a
new Form, and much Enlargement; and
to found it, not upon Imagination, but
Reason helped by Experience. This
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48001:18"/>
                     <hi>Great Instauration,</hi> was to consist of <hi>Six
Parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>First Part</hi> proposed was, the <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Sciences:</hi> And this the Author
perfected in that Golden Treatise of the
<hi>Advancement of Learning,</hi> addressed to
King <hi>Iames,</hi> a Labour which he termed<note n="u" place="margin">In his Letter to Sir <hi>T. Bodley,</hi> p. 34. <hi>Resus.</hi>
                     </note>
the comfort of his other Labours. This
he first wrote in two Books, in the <hi>English</hi>
Tongue, in which his Pen excelled. And
of this First Edition that is to be meant,
which, with some Truth, and more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
he wrote to the Earl of <hi>Salisbury;</hi>
telling him<note n="w" place="margin">In a Letter in <hi>Resusc.</hi> p. 31.</note>, <q>That, in his Book, he was
contented to awake better Spirits, being
himself like a Bell-ringer, who is first up
to call others to Church.</q> Afterwards he
enlargeth the Second of those Two Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
which contained especially the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovesaid
Partition, and divided the Matter
of it into Eight Books. And, knowing
that this Work was desired beyond the Seas,
and being also aware, that Books written
in a modern Language, which receiveth
much change in a few Years, were out of
use; he caus'd that part of it which he
had written in <hi>English,</hi> to be translated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue, by Mr. <hi>Herbert,</hi> and
some others, who were esteemed Masters
in the <hi>Roman</hi> Eloquence. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48001:18"/>
which, he so suted the Style to his
Conceptions, by a strict Castigation of the
whole Work, that it may deservedly seem
his own. The Translation of this Work
(that is, of much of the Two Books writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by him in <hi>English</hi>) he first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to Dr. <hi>Playfer,</hi> a Professour of
Divinity in the University of <hi>Cambridg;</hi>
using, amongst others, these words to him.
<q>The<note n="x" place="margin">Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. of Letters in <hi>Resusc.</hi> p. 33, 34.</note> privateness of the Language consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
wherein the Book is written, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
so many Readers; as, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side, the obscurity of the Argument,
in many parts of it, excludeth many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
I must account it, a second Birth
of that Work, if it might be translated
into <hi>Latine,</hi> without manifest loss of the
Sence, and Matter. For this purpose I
could not represent to my self any Man,
into whose hands I do more earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
that Work should fall, than your
Self: For, by that I have heard, and
read, I know no Man a greater Master,
in commanding Words to serve Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Doctor was willing to serve so Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
a Person, and so worthy a Design;
and, within a while, sent him a Specimen
of a <hi>Latine</hi> Translation. But Men, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
come short of themselves when they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48001:19"/>
strive to out-doe themselves. They put a
force upon their Natural Genius, and, by
straining of it, crack and disable it. And
so, it seems, it happened to that Worthy
and Elegant Man. Upon this great Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
he would be over-accurate; and he
sent a Specimen of such superfine Latinity,
that the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> did not encourage him
to labour further in that Work, in the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of which, he desired not so much neat
and polite, as clear Masculine, and apt
Expression.</p>
                  <p>The whole of this Book was rendred into
<hi>English</hi> by Dr. <hi>Gilbert Wats,</hi> of <hi>Oxford;</hi>
and the Translation has been well received
by many. But some there were, who
wished that a Translation had been set
forth, in which the Genius and Spirit of
the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> had more appeared. And
I have seen a Letter, written by certain
Gentlemen to Dr. <hi>Rawley,</hi> wherein they
<hi>thus</hi> importune him for a more accurate
Version, by his own Hand. <q>It is our
humble sute to you, and we do earnestly
solicit you,—to give your self the
Trouble, to correct the too much defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Translation of <hi>de Augmentis
Scientiarum,</hi> which Dr. <hi>Watts</hi> hath set
forth. It is a thousand pities, that so
worthy a Piece should lose its Grace
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48001:19"/>
and Credit by an ill Expositor; since
those Persons, who read that Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
taking it for Genuine, and upon that
presumption not regarding the <hi>Latine</hi>
Edition, are thereby robbed of that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
which (if you would please to
undertake the Business) they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
This tendeth to the dishonour of
that Noble Lord, and the hindrance of
the <hi>Advancement of Learning.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This Work hath been also translated into
<hi>French</hi> upon the motion of the <hi>Marquis
Fiat.</hi> But in it there are many things
wholly omitted, many things perfectly mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
and some things (especially such
as relate to Religion) wilfully perverted.
Insomuch that, in in one place, he makes his
Lordship to magnifie the Legend: A Book,
sure of little Credit with him, when he
thus began one of his Essays<note n="*" place="margin">Essay of Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism.</note>; <q>I had

and the Talmud, and the Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,

without a Mind.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fairest, and most correct Edition of
this Book in <hi>Latine,</hi> is that in Folio, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at <hi>London, Anno</hi> 1623. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever

the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Italic</hi> shapes of them are
confounded.</p>
                  <p>To this Book we may reduce the first
four Chapters of that imperfect Treatise,

and called <hi>The Description of the Intellectual

the Partition of the Sciences, so accurately

of the Advancement of Learning. To
this Work, also, we may reduce, the
Treatise called <hi>Thema Coeli,</hi> published like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in <hi>Latine,</hi> by <hi>Gruter.</hi> And it parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
belongeth to the Fourth Chapter,

tending to an improvement of the
System of the Heavens, which is treated of
in that place, the Houses of which (had God
granted him life) he would have understood
as well almost as he did his own. For the

for the Composure of it, from his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie's
other Affairs, he had made some sort
of Restitution, by doing Honour to his
Name and his Reign. The King wrote to
him, then Chancellor, a Letter of thanks,
with his own Hand<note n="c" place="margin">Dated Octob. 16. 1620. See Collect. of Letters in <hi>Resusc.</hi> p. 83.</note>; and this was the
first part of it. <q>My Lord, I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
your Letter, and your Book, than
the which you could not have sent,
a more acceptable Present, to me. How
thankful I am for it, cannot better be
expressed by me, than by a firm Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I have taken; First, to read it
through with Care and Attention;
though I should steal some Hours from
my Sleep; having, otherwise, as little
spare Time to read it, as you had to
write it: And then to use the liberty of
a true Friend, in not sparing to ask you
the question in any Point, whereof I
stand in doubt, <hi>(Nam ejus est explicare,
cujus est condere;)</hi> as, on the other part,
I will willingly give a due commendation
to such Places, as in my Opinion, shall
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48001:21"/>
deserve it. In the mean time, I can with
comfort, assure you, that you could not
have made choice of a Subject, more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting
your Place, and your Universal,
and Methodical Knowledg.—</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Three Copies of this <hi>Organum,</hi> were sent
by the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> to Sir <hi>Henry Wotton,</hi>
one who took a pride (as himself saith)
in a certain Congeniality with his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
Studies. And how very much he va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
the <hi>Present,</hi> we may learn from his own
words. <q>You Lordship (said he<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Sir</hi> H. Wotton'<hi>s Remains,</hi> p. 298, 299.</note>) hath
done a great and ever-living Benefit to
all the Children of Nature, and to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
her self in her uttermost extent of
Latitude: Who, never before, had so
noble, nor so true an Interpreter, or
(as I am readier to style your Lordship)
never so inward a Secretary of her Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net.
But of your Work (which came
but this Week to my hands) I shall find
occasion to speak more hereafter; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
yet read only the First Book there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and a few Aphorisms of the Second.
For it is not a Banquet that Men may su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficially
taste, and put up the rest in
their Pockets; but, in truth, a solid
Feast, which requireth due Mastication.
Therefore, when I have once, my self,
perused the whole, I determine to have
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48001:21"/>
it read, piece by piece, at certain Hours,
in my Domestic College, as an Ancient
Author: For I have learned thus much
by it already, that we are extremely mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
in the Computation of Antiquity,
by searching it backwards; because, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
the first Times were the youngest;
especially in points of Natural Discovery
and Experience.—</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Novum Organum</hi> containeth in it,
Instructions concerning a better and more
perfect use of Reason in our Inquisitions
after things. And therefore the Second
Title which he gave it was, <hi>Directions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Interpretations of Nature.</hi> And, by
this Art, he designed a Logick more useful
than the Vulgar, and an <hi>Organon</hi> apter to
help the Intellectual Powers, than that of
<hi>Aristotle.</hi> For he proposed here, not so
much the Invention of Arguments, as of
Arts; and in Demonstration, he used In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
more than Contentious Syllogism;
and in his Induction, he did not straightway
proceed from a few particular Sensible No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to the most general of all; but rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Axioms by degrees, designing the most
general Notions for the last place; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
on such of them as are, not merely
Notional, but, coming from Nature, do
also lead to her.</p>

                  <p>In the bringing this Labour to Maturity,

one after another; and every Year alter'd
and amended in the Frame thereof, till at
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48001:23"/>
last it came to the Model in which it was
committed to the Press. It was like a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

will, probably, be like to it in its Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance.</p>
                  <p>Now he received from many parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

not (he saith,<note n="*" place="margin">In Epi. to Bishop <hi>Andrews.</hi>
                     </note>) expect at the first, in
so abstruse an Argument; yet nevertheless
(he saith again) he had just cause to doubt
that it flew too high over <hi>Mens Heads:</hi>
He purpos'd therefore, (though he broke
the order of Time) to draw it down to
the sense by some Patterns, of <hi>Natural Story

                  <p>This Work consisteth of several Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</p>
                  <p>The First is his <hi>Parasceve,</hi> or Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
to the History Natural and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental.
It is a short Discourse written in
<hi>Latine,</hi> by the Author, and annexed to the
<hi>Novum Organum Scientiarum.</hi> There is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
in it, in Ten Aphorisms, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48001:23"/>
manner of framing a Natural History.
After which followeth a Catalogue of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Histories, of Coelestial and Aereal
Bodies, and of those in the Terrestrial
Globe, with the Species of them: Such
as Metals, Gems, Stones, Earths, Salts,
Plants, Fishes, Fowls, Insects; Man, in
his Body, and in his Inventions mechanic
and liberal.</p>
                  <p>A late Pen has travelled in the Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this little Description of Natural
History; and it is extant in the Second Part
of the <hi>Resuscitation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this <hi>Parasceve,</hi> it is proper to reduce
the <hi>Fragment of the Abecedarium Naturae;</hi>

                  <p>Neither do we, here, unfitly place the
<hi>Fable of the New Atlantis:</hi> For it is the
Model of a College to be Instituted by
some King who philosophizeth, for the
Interpreting of Nature, and the Improving
of Arts. His Lordship did (it seems)
think of finishing this Fable, by adding to
it a Frame of Laws, or a kind of <hi>Vtopian</hi>
Commonwealth; but he was diverted by
his desire of Collecting the Natural Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48001:24"/>
which was first in his esteem. This
Supplement has been lately made by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Hand<note n="o" place="margin">See <hi>R. H.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin. of N. <hi>Atlantis</hi> Octo. <hi>Lon.</hi> 1660.</note>: A great and hardy Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

in the <hi>Latine</hi> Edition of it, and in
the <hi>Franckfort</hi> Collection, goeth under
the false and absurd Title of <hi>Novus Atlas:</hi>
As if his Lordship had alluded to a Person,
or a Mountain, and not to a great Island,
which according to <hi>Plato,</hi> perished in the
Ocean.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Second Section is,</hi> the History of
Winds, written in <hi>Latine</hi> by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
and by <hi>R. G.</hi> Gentleman, turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>English.</hi> It was Dedicated to King
<hi>Charles,</hi> then Prince, as the First-fruits of
his Lordship's Natural History; and as a
grain of Mustard-seed, which was, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
to grow into a Tree of Experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Science. This was the Birth of the first
of those Six Months, in which he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
(God assisting him) to write Six
several Histories of Natural Things. To
wit, of <hi>Dense and Rare Bodies,</hi> of <hi>Heavy and
Light Bodies;</hi> of <hi>Sympathy and Antipathy;</hi>
of <hi>Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury;</hi> of <hi>Life
and Death;</hi> and (which he first perfected)
that of <hi>Winds,</hi> which he calls the Wings
by which Men flie on the Sea, and the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48001:24"/>
Beesoms of the Air and Earth. And he,
rightly, observeth concerning those <hi>Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati</hi>
(for, as he saith, they are not a
part of the Six Days Works, or Primary
Creatures) that the Generation of them
has not been well understood, because
Men have been Ignorant of the Nature
and Power of the Air, on which the
Winds attend, as <hi>Aeolus</hi> on <hi>Iuno.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>English</hi> Translation of this Book of
Winds, is printed in the Second Part of
the <hi>Resuscitatio,</hi> as it is called, though im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly
enough; for it is rather a Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Books already Printed, than a
Resuscitation of any considerable Ones,
which before slept in private Manuscript.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Third Section is,</hi> the History of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity</hi>
and <hi>Rarity,</hi> and of the Expansion and
Coition of Matter in Space. This Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
was written by his Lordship in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine;</hi>
and was publish'd very imperfectly
by <hi>Gruter,</hi> amongst other Treatises, to
which he gave the Title of <hi>Impetus Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phici</hi>
                     <note n="o" place="margin">See Verulamii Scripta, <hi>p. 336, 337, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </note>;
and very perfectly and correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by Dr. <hi>Rawley,</hi> out of whose Hands none
of his Lordship's Works came lame and ill
shapen into the World.</p>
                  <p>In this Argument, his Lordship allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that nothing is substracted, or added
to the total Sum of Matter, does yet grant,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48001:25"/>
that in the same Space there may be much
more or less of Matter; and that (for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
sake) there is ten times more of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in one Tun of Water, than in one of
Air. By which his Lordship should seem
to grant, what yet I do not find he does
in any other place; either that there is a
<hi>Vacuum</hi> in Nature, or <hi>Penetration</hi> of parts
in Bodies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Third Section is,</hi> the History of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi>
and <hi>Levity,</hi> which (as before was
said) was but design'd; and remaineth
not (that I can hear of) so much as in
the rude draught of its Designation. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
there are published his Lordship's To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pics,
or Articles of Inquisition, touching
<hi>Gravity</hi> and <hi>Levity,</hi> in his Book of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
<note n="q" place="margin">De Augm. Scient. l. 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. 3. p 386.</note>; and a brief <hi>Aditus</hi> to this
History, annexed to the <hi>Historia Ventorum.</hi>
In that <hi>Aditus,</hi> or Entrance, he rejecteth
the Appetite of heavy Bodies to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Earth, as a Scholastic Fancy:
He taketh it for a certain Truth, That Body
does not suffer but from Body, or that
there is any local motion which is not soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited,
either from the parts of the Body
it self which is moved; or from Bodies
adjacent, either contiguously, or in the
next Vicinity, or at least within the Orb
of their Activity: And lastly, he commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48001:25"/>
the Magnetic Virtues introduced by
<hi>Gilbert,</hi> whom yet in this he disalloweth,
that he made himself as 'twere a Magnet,
and drew every thing to his Hypothesis.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Fourth Section is,</hi> the History of <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy</hi>
and <hi>Antipathy.</hi> Of this we have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>Aditus</hi> annexed to that of <hi>Historia
Gravis &amp; Levis;</hi> and a few Instances in
his <hi>Sylva Sylvarum</hi>
                     <note n="r" place="margin">See Exper. 95, 96, 97. 462, 480, to 498.</note>. In this History he
designed to avoid Magical Fancies, which
raise the Mind, in these things, to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
height; and pretence of occultness of
Quality, which layeth the Mind asleep,
and preventeth further Inquiry into these
useful secrets of Nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Fifth Section is,</hi> the History of <hi>Salt,
Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> the three Principles
of the common <hi>Chymists;</hi> of which three, he
thought the first to be no primordial Body,
but a Compound of the two others, knit
together by an acid Spirit. The <hi>Aditus</hi>
                     <note n="s" place="margin">All these <hi>Adi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> are transl. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Engl.</hi> by the Trans. of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of Winds.</note>
to this is annexed to that of <hi>Historia Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathiae
&amp; Antipathiae Rerum;</hi> but the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
it self was (I think) never written.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Sixth Section is,</hi> the History of <hi>Life</hi>
and <hi>Death;</hi> written by his Lordship in
<hi>Latine;</hi> and first turn'd into <hi>English</hi> by an
injudicious Translator; and rendred much
better a second time, by an abler Pen, made
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48001:26"/>
abler still by the Advice and Assistance of
Dr. <hi>Rawley.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Work, though ranked last, amongst
the Six Monthly Designations; yet was
set forth in the second Place: His Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
(as he saith) inverting the Order,
in respect of the prime use of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in which the least loss of time was,
by him, esteemed very precious. The
Subject of this Book (which Sir <hi>Henry
Wotton</hi>
                     <note n="t" place="margin">Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, p. 455.</note> calleth, none of the least of
his Lordship's Works) and the Argument
of which, some had before undertaken<note n="u" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa</hi> de pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pag. vitâ Octo. <hi>Lips.</hi> 1615.</note>;
but to much less purpose is the first of
those, which he put in his Catalogue of the
<hi>Magnalia Naturae.</hi> And doubless, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
undertook both a great and a most
desirable Work, of making <hi>Art short,</hi> and
<hi>Life easie and long.</hi> 
                     <q>And it was his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
wish, that the nobler sort of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians
might not employ their times
wholly in the sordidness of Cures, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be honoured for necessity only; but
become Coadjutors and Instruments of
the Divine Omnipotence and Clemence,
in prolonging and renewing the Life of
Man: And in helping Christians who
pant after the Land of Promise, so to
journey through this World's Wilderness,
as to have their Shoes and Garments,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48001:26"/>
(these of their frail Bodies) little worn
and impair'd.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Seventh</hi> and greatest Branch of the
<hi>Third Part of the Instauration, is his</hi> Sylva
Sylvarum, <hi>or Natural History;</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
many <hi>Materials</hi> for the building of
Philosophy, as the <hi>Organum</hi> doth <hi>Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
for the <hi>Work.</hi> It is an History not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Nature freely moving in her Course,
(as in the production of Meteors, Plants,
Minerals); but also of Nature in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint,
and vexed and tortur'd by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Art and Experiment. And it is not
an History of such things orderly ranged;
but thrown into an Heap. For his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
that he might not discourage other
Collectors, did not cast this Book into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
Method; for which reason it hath the
less Ornament, but not much the less Use.</p>
                  <p>In this Book are contain'd Experiments
of Light, and Experiments of Use (as his
Lordship was wont to distinguish); and
amongst them some <hi>Extraordinary,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<hi>Common.</hi> He understood that what
was Common in one Country, might be
a Rarity in another: For which Reason,
Dr. <hi>Caius,</hi> when in <hi>Italy,</hi> thought it worth
his pains to make a large and Elegant De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of <hi>Our way of Brewing.</hi> His Lordship
also knew well, that an Experiment mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48001:27"/>
to the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> was a good ground for
the Wise to build further upon. And him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
rendred <hi>Common ones, extraordinary</hi> by
<hi>Admonitions,</hi> for further Trials and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements.
Hence his Lordship took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to say<note n="w" place="margin">Nat. Hist. Cent. 1. <hi>p.</hi> 25. Exper. 93.</note>, that his writing of <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va
Sylvarum,</hi> was (to speak properly)
not a Natural History, but a high kind of
Natural Magic: Because it was not only
a description of Nature, but a breaking
of Nature into great and strange Works.</p>
                  <p>This Book was written by his Lordship
in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, and translated by
an obscure Interpreter, into <hi>French,</hi> and
out of that Translation, into <hi>Latine,</hi> by
<hi>Iames Gruter,</hi> in such ill manner, that they
darkned his Lordship's Sence, and debased
his Expression. <hi>Iames Gruter</hi> was sensible
of his Miscarriage, being kindly adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
of it by Dr. <hi>Rawley:</hi> And he left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him divers amendments, published by
his Brother <hi>Isaac Gruter,</hi> in a second Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<note n="x" place="margin">Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stel. 1661. in 16<hi rend="sup">•</hi>.</note>. Yet still so many Errors have
escaped, that the Work requireth a Third
Hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mounsieur Aelius Deodatus</hi> had once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
an able Person in the translation of
this Book; one who could have done his
Lordship right, and oblig'd such Readers
as understood not the <hi>English</hi> Original. He
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48001:27"/>
began, and went through the <hi>Three first
Centuries,</hi> and then desisted; being desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by him who set him on work, to take
his hand quite off from that Pen, with
which he moved so slowly. His Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Third Century</hi> is now in my
Hands; but that of the two first, I believe
is lost.</p>
                  <p>His Lordship thus began that Third Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury
in <hi>English.</hi> 
                     <q>All Sounds (whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver)
move round; that is to say, on all
sides; upwards, downwards, forwards,
and backwards. This appeareth in all
Instances.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Sounds</hi> do not require to be convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the sense in a right Line, as <hi>Visibles</hi>
do, but may be arched. Though it be
true, they move strongest in a right Line;
which nevertheless is not caused by the
<hi>rightness</hi> of the Line, but by the <hi>short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of the Distance; <hi>Linea rect a brevis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sima.</hi>
And therefore we see, if a <hi>Wall</hi>
be between, and you speak on the one
side, you hear it on the other; which is
not because the Sound passeth through
the <hi>Wall,</hi> but archeth over the <hi>Wall.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>These words are thus turned, by <hi>Iames
Gruter,</hi> in his last Edition; and tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
well: Especially if we compare with
some other places in his Translation.</p>

                  <p>The Judicious Reader may discern by
this little, how much this latter Translator
excell'd the former, in comprehending and
expressing his Lordship's Sence. And yet
I cannot say, that throughout those Three
Centuries in which he hath labour'd, he
hath every where truly hit his Conceit.
His Lordship had a very peculiar Vein with
him; and I may resemble it to the singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in the <hi>Face</hi> of <hi>Cardan,</hi> who tells us, in
his own Life, that he set to Painters of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Countries, yet could never have the
Air of <hi>it</hi> taken by them.</p>
                  <p>Whilst I am speaking of this Work of
his Lordship's, of <hi>Natural History,</hi> there
comes to my mind a very Memorable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
reported by him who bare a part
in it, the Reverend Dr. <hi>Rawley.</hi> One day,
his Lordship was dictating to that Doctor,
some of the Experiments in his <hi>Sylva.</hi> The
same day, he had sent a Friend to Court,
to receive for him a final Answer, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the effect of a Grant which had been
made him by King <hi>Iames.</hi> He had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
only hope of it, and hope deferr'd;
and he was desirous to know the event of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48001:29"/>
the Matter, and to be free'd, one way or
other, from the suspence of his thoughts.
His Friend returning, told him plainly,
that he must thenceforth, despair of that
Grant, how much soever his Fortunes need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it. <hi>Be it so,</hi> said his Lordship; and
then he dismissed his Friend very chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
with thankful acknowledgments of his
Service. His Friend being gone, he came
straightway to Dr. <hi>Rawley,</hi> and said thus
to him. Well Sir! <hi>Yon Business won't go

                  <p>For it was his Lordship's

a distinct and comparative one, of
their Virtues, such as those of Density and

and Levity; Heat and Cold.</p>
                  <p>Such a Collection of <hi>Natural History,</hi> was
of necessity to be undertaken a-new. For
the Collections, which were before in Mens
Hands, were but a small and inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48001:30"/>
heap, when the Chaff and Fable were
sifted from them; though the more consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
for that Separation. And further,

these Histories were at first framed rather
for Delight, and Table-talk, than for Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy.
Stories were feigned for the sake
of their Morals; and they were frequently
taken upon groundless Trust; and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Writers borrowed out of the more An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
and were not Experimenters, but
Transcribers: And such a one was <hi>Pliny</hi>
himself, both in his larger and lesser
Work; I mean that of <hi>Solinus,</hi> who is but
<hi>Pliny</hi> contracted.</p>
                  <p>There are who have accused the Lord
<hi>Bacon</hi> himself, for taking Experiments too
readily upon Trust, and without delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and discreet Choice. To such I will
return Answer in his own words. <q>The
Rejection<note n="f" place="margin">Nat. Hist. Cent. 1. <hi>p.</hi> 6. Exper. 25.</note> which I continually use;
of Experiments (though it appeareth
not) is infinite; but yet, if an Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be probable in the Work, and of
great use I receive it, but deliver it as
doubtful.</q>

                  <p>The Fourth Part of the Instauration <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed,
was</hi> Scala Intellectû s.</p>
                  <p>To this there is some sort of entrance in
his Lordship's distribution of the <hi>Novum
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48001:30"/>
Organum,</hi> and in a Page or two under that
Title of <hi>Scala,</hi> published by <hi>Gruter</hi>
                     <note n="g" place="margin">See Scripta, <hi>p.</hi> 379.</note>:
But the Work it self passed not beyond
the Model of it in the Head of the Noble
Author.</p>
                  <p>That which he intended, was a particular
Explication, and Application of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Part of the Instauration,</hi> (which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
general Rules for the Interpretation
of Nature) by gradual Instances and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</p>
                  <p>He thought that his Rules, without some
more sensible Explication, were like Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
in Geometry, or Mechanics, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Figures, and Types of Engines. He
therefore designed to select certain Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in Nature, or Art; and as it were, to
draw to the Sense a certain Scheme of the
beginning and progress of Philosophical
Disquisition in them; shewing by degrees,
where our consideration takes Root, and
how it spreadeth and advanceth. And
some such thing is done by those who, from
the <hi>Cicatricula,</hi> or from the <hi>Punctum Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liens,</hi>
observe and register all the <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi>
of the Animal unto its Death, and
after it also in the Medical, or Culinarie,
or other use of its Body; together with
all the train of the Thoughts occasioned
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48001:31"/>
by those <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> or by others in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
with them.</p>
                  <p>And because he intended to exhibit such
Observations, as they gradually arise;
therefore he gave to that Designed Work,
the Title of the <hi>Scale,</hi> or <hi>Ladder of the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</hi>
He also expressed the same
Conceit by another Metaphor<note n="h" place="margin">See Scriptae, <hi>p.</hi> 384.</note>, advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Students to imitate Men, who by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by degrees from several Eminencies of
some very high Mountain, do at length ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
at the Top, or Pike of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Fifth Part of the Instauration,</hi> design'd,
was, what he call'd <hi>Prodromi sive Anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones
Philosophiae Secundae.</hi> To this we find a
very brief Entrance, in the <hi>Organum</hi>
                     <note n="i" place="margin">In Distrib. Op. <hi>p.</hi> 17.</note>,

                     </note>.
And though his Lordship is not known to
have composed any part of this Work by
it self, yet something of it is to be Collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Axioms, and greater Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
interspersed in his Natural Histories,
which are not pure but mixed Writings.
The Anticipations he intended to pay
down as Use, till he might furnish the
World wit the Principal, in</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Sixth and last Part of his Instauration,</hi>
designed, which was, <hi>Philosophia Secunda
sive Scientia Activa.</hi> This General Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,
founded upon Sensible Nature, or
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48001:31"/>
Artificial Experiments, and built up by
degrees in Observations and Axioms, he
at length despaired of, and commended to
Posterity. Time only can throughly finish
what his Lordship began, and sufficiently
commend his Diligence and Sagacity, who
collected so many Materials, and dispos'd
them into such Order; and made in so
short a Time, and (for the most part)
in the midst of Civil Business, such
mighty Preparations towards the building
of the <hi>House of Wisdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After having mentioned the several
Parts of this great Work, which concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
especially, <hi>Body Natural;</hi> we proceed
to enumerate others of his Lordship's
Writings, which concern <hi>Civil,</hi> or <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Matters.</hi> And though most of them
are of a mixed nature, and History is sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
written without some Political Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections;
yet to those who are not over
Nice, the division of them into Historical
and Political, may be passable.</p>
                  <p>His Historical Works are these:</p>
                  <p>The first, Is the History of <hi>Henry</hi> the
Seventh<note n="l" place="margin">Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished first 1622.</note>, written Elegantly, by his
Lordship in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed
to his Highness the Prince of <hi>Wales;</hi>
and turned afterwards into <hi>Latine.</hi> An
History which required such a Reporter:
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48001:32"/>
those Times being Times both of great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution,
and Settlement, through the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
and Union of the Roses.</p>
                  <p>This was the First Book which he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
after his Retirement from an Active
Life<note n="m" place="margin">See the Cat. of his Works then writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his Life, by <hi>D. R.</hi>
                     </note>. Upon which occasion he wrote
thus to the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi>
                     <note n="n" place="margin">In Epist. bef. Dial of an holy War.</note>. Being
(as I am) no more able to do my Country
Service, it remaineth unto me, to do it
Honour: Which I have endeavoured to
do in my Work, of the Reign of King
<hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Second is,</hi> the Fragment of the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of Henry the Eighth,</hi> printed at the end
of his Lordship's Miscellany Works, of
which the best Edition is that in Quarto,
in the Year 1629. This Work he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took,
upon the Motion of King <hi>Charles</hi>
the First, but (a Greater King not lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him time) he only began it; for that
which we have of it, was (it seems) but
one Mornings Work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Third is,</hi> a Memorial, intituled the
<hi>Felicities of Queen Elizabeth</hi>

Ability, translated it into <hi>English</hi>

(the Addition of the Pope's Bull)

of his Skill in writing an History of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
leaving the World, to the unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
loss of the learned part of it; his late
Majesty, a great favourer of that Work,
and wise in the choice of fit Workmen,
encourag'd Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> to endeavour
it, by his Royal Invitation, and a Pension

Discipline amongst the <hi>Christians</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
The <hi>Third,</hi> of Propagation of the
Faith amongst <hi>Vnbelievers.</hi> In all which
it is plain, that his Lordship dealt in the
Affairs of the Church, as he was wont to
do in Civil Matters, <hi>Suavibus Modis,</hi> and
in the Mean. Accordingly he was wont
to compare himself to the Miller of <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi>
a Village by <hi>Cambridg.</hi> Of him
his Lordship telleth, that he was wont to
pray <hi>for Peace among the Willows:</hi> For
whilst the Winds blew, the Wind-mills
wrought, and his Water-mill was less Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom'd
<note n="d" place="margin">See Letter to Mr <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> in <hi>Resusc. p.</hi> 36.</note>. His Lordship was for pacify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Disputes, knowing that <hi>Controversies
of Religion,</hi> would hinder the <hi>Advancement
of Sciences.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Writings which relate to <hi>Civil Polity,</hi>
are very considerable; and yet they fall
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48001:35"/>
much short of that which he had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in design. For he aimed at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
Model of a Commonwealth, though he
hath left only some preparation towards
it in his <hi>Doctrine of Enlarging the bounds
of Empire;</hi> and in a few <hi>Abhorisms</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Vniversal Iustice</hi>
                     <note n="e" place="margin">In Augm. Scient. <hi>l. 8 c. 3. p.</hi> 668. to <hi>p. 690, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </note>. He also
made a Proposal to King <hi>Iames,</hi> of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
of the Laws of <hi>England.</hi> But other
Studies, together with want of Time and
Assistance, prevented the ripening of these
Thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Now his Lordship's Writings in this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of Civil Polity, are either more
<hi>General,</hi> or such as have more <hi>Especial</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the several Dominions of the King
of <hi>England.</hi> His Political Writings of a
more <hi>general</hi> Nature, are his <hi>Apothegms,</hi> and
<hi>Essays,</hi> besides the <hi>Excerpta,</hi> out of the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement</hi>
above remembred. Both these
contain much of that Matter which we
usually call <hi>Moral,</hi> distinguishing it from
that which is <hi>Civil:</hi> In the handling of
which sort of Argument, his Lordship has
been esteemed so far to excel, that he hath
had a Comment written on him as on an
Author in <hi>Ethics</hi>
                     <note n="f" place="margin">See <hi>V. Placcii</hi> Comment. in <hi>l.</hi> 7. Aug. Scient. de Philosophiâ Morali augendâ. in <hi>Octavo. Franc.</hi> an. 1677.</note> and an Advancer of
that most useful part of Learning. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48001:35"/>
which, I am bold to put these
Books under this Head of <hi>Matter Political:</hi>
Both because they contain a greater por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Matter; and because in true
Philosophy, the Doctrine of <hi>Politics</hi> and
<hi>Ethics,</hi> maketh up but one Body, and
springeth from one Root, the End of God
Almighty in the Government of the
World.</p>

for the Brain of so great a Man;
they may think with themselves how little
a time <hi>he went with it,</hi> and from thence
make some allowance. Besides, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

his Lordship entertain'd this persuasion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

                     </note>, that the <hi>Latine Volume

I once heard from Dr. <hi>Rawley;</hi> but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
now recal them. To this <hi>Latine</hi> Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he gave the Title of <hi>Sermones Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deles,</hi>

of the <hi>Wise, Faithful Sayings;</hi> that is, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
Propositious worthy of firm Assent,
and ready Acceptance. And (as I think)
he alluded more particularly, in this Title,
to a passage in <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Eccles. 12. 10, 11.</note>, where the
Preacher saith that he sought to find out

                  <p>Touching these latter Pieces, which may
be termed Writings in <hi>Iuridical Polity,</hi> and
which he wrote as a debtor to his Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48001:41"/>
it is beyond my Skill, as well as out
of the way of my Studies, to pass a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Judgment on them. Onely I may note
it in the general, that if he reached not
so far in the Common Law, as Sir <hi>Edward
Cook,</hi> and some other Ornaments of the
long Robe: the prepossession of his Mind
by Philosophical Notions, and his regard
to Matters of <hi>Estate,</hi> rather than to those
of <hi>Law,</hi> may be assigned as the true Causes
of it: For doubtless Parts were not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
On this Subject it is, that he thus
writeth to Sir <hi>Thomas Bodley</hi>
                     <note n="i" place="margin">Coll. of Letters in <hi>Resusc.</hi> p. 34.</note>. <q>I think
no Man may more truly say with the
Psalm, <hi>multùm incola fuit Anima mea,</hi> than
my self. For I do confess, since I was
of any Understanding, my Mind hath,
in effect, been absent from that I have
done: And, in absence are many Errors,
which I do willingly acknowledg, and
amongst the rest this great one that led
the rest; That knowing my self, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Calling, to be fitter to hold a Book
than to play a Part, I have led my Life
in civil Causes, for which I was not very
fit by Nature, and more unfit by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occupation
of my Mind.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To a like purpose is <hi>this,</hi> in a Manuscript
Letter to the Lord Chancellor <hi>Egerton,</hi>
which I have sometimes perus'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:48001:41"/>
—<q>I am not<note n="k" place="margin">M S. <hi>Letter of L.</hi> Bacons.</note> so deceived in my
self, but that I know very well, (and I
think, your Lordship is <hi>major Corde,</hi> and
in your Wisdom you note it more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than I can in my self) that in Practising
the Law, I play not my best Game, which
maketh me accept it with a <hi>nisi quid
potius;</hi> as the best of my Fortune, and a
thing better agreeable to better Gifts than
mine, but not to mine.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it appeareth, by what he hath said
in a Letter to the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>
                     <note n="l" place="margin">Coll. in <hi>Resusc.</hi> p. III.</note>, that
he once thought not to practise in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.
<q>I am purposed (said he) not
to follow the practice of the Law.—And
my Reason is only, because it drinketh
too much Time, which I have dedicated
to better purposes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this Head of <hi>Polity,</hi> relating to the
Affairs of these Kingdoms, we may reduce
most of his <hi>Lordship's Letters,</hi> published
correctly in the <hi>Resuscitatio,</hi> and in these
<hi>Remains,</hi> and from uncorrect Copies, in
the <hi>Cabala.</hi> These they though often contain
private Matters, yet commonly they have
Matters of Estate intermingled with them.
Thus, his Letter to the Lord-Treasurer
<hi>Burghley</hi>
                     <note n="m" place="margin">P. 1.</note>, was writ in Excuse of his
Speech in Parliament, against the Triple
Subsidy. So, many of the Letters to the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48001:42"/>
Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>
                     <note n="n" place="margin">Pag. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <note n="o" place="margin">P. 76.</note>, relate plainly to the <hi>Irish</hi> Affairs. So,
some Letters to King <hi>Iames,</hi> relate to the
Cases of <hi>Peacham</hi>
                     <note n="p" place="margin">P. 48, 51.</note>, <hi>Owen</hi>

to one certain Head.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Last of all,</hi> For his Lordship's Writings
upon <hi>Pious Subjects,</hi> though for the Nature
of the Argument, they deserve the first

appearing nothing so extraordinary in the

an earlier mention.</p>

good Friend, Mr. <hi>George Herbert:</hi> For he
judged the Argument to be sutable to him

<note n="y" place="margin">In l. 2. de Augm. Scient. c. 13.</note> about it; and he had some sort
of Talent that way also. Hence, when

made it. The truth is, 'tis one of the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
things in the World, to excel in Poetry;
and to Attempt, and not to Excel, is to
lose both Time and Reputation: For in

And yet the Stationer (who, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
by his performance, was both Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
and Publisher) does tell us of this
Edition, that it was purged of all Faults.
But his Collection cannot be so purged,
unless the whole Volume be made one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Blot. Posterity (I hope) will do his
Lordship Honour, and Benefit to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
in a larger and more accurate Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of his Works. These <hi>Latine</hi> ones,
as also the <hi>Miscellanies,</hi> and the two parts
of the <hi>Resuscitatio,</hi> (which are the only
attempt in English) being far short of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                  <p>Thus far I have travell'd in an Account,
(such as it is) of those Genuine Writings
of the <hi>Lord Bacon,</hi> which are already pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd;
and which, being (like <hi>Medals of
Gold</hi>) both <hi>rich</hi> in their <hi>Matter,</hi> and <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful</hi>
in their <hi>Form,</hi> have met with a very
great, and well nigh, equal number of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasers
and Admirers.</p>
                  <p>This general Acceptance of his Works,
has expos'd him to that ill and unjust usage
which is common to Eminent Writers. For
on such are fathered, sometimes Spurious
Treatises; sometimes most Corrupt Copies
of good Originals; sometimes their Essays
and first Thoughts upon good Subjects,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48001:44"/>
though laid aside by them Unprosecuted
and Uncorrected; and sometimes the very
Toys of their Youth, written by them in
trivial or loose Arguments, before they had
arriv'd either at ripeness of Judgment, or
sobriety of Temper.</p>
                  <p>The veriest <hi>Straws</hi> (like that of <hi>Father

                  <p>The Press hath been injurious in this
kind, to the Memory of Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi>
to whom it owed a deep and solemn Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence.
It hath sent forth a Pamphlet
upon an Idle Subject, under the venerable
Name of that great Man, who (like the
Grass in hot Countries, of which they are
wont to say that it groweth Hay) was
born Grave and Sober: And still, further
to aggravate the Injury, it hath given to
that Idle Subject, the idler Title of the
<hi>Ex-ale-tation of Ale.</hi>

                  <p>In such an unbecoming manner it hath
dealt, long ago<note n="d" place="margin">About the Year 1658.</note>, with the very Learned
and Ingenious Author of the <hi>Vulgar Errors.</hi>
It hath obtruded upon him, whilst alive,
a dull and worthless Book stollen, for the
most part out of the <hi>Physic's</hi> of <hi>Magirus,</hi>
by a very Ignorant Person: A Plagiary so
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48001:44"/>
ignorant and so unskilful in his <hi>Rider,</hi> that
not distinguishing betwixt <hi>Laevis</hi> and <hi>Levis,</hi>
in the said <hi>Magirus,</hi> he hath told us of
the <hi>Liver,</hi> that one part of it is <hi>gibbo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s,</hi>
and the other <hi>light.</hi> And yet he had the
confidence to call this Scribble, <hi>The Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
of Nature unlocked:</hi> An arrogant and
fanciful Title, of which his true Humility
would no more have suffer'd him to have
been the Father, than his great Learning
could have permitted him to have been
the Author of the Book. For I can assure
the Reader upon my knowledg, that as he
is a Philosopher very inward with Nature,
so he is one who never boasts of his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with her.</p>
                  <p>Neither hath the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> gone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his share in this Injustice from the Press.
He hath been ill dealt with in the Letters
printed in the <hi>Cabala,</hi> and <hi>Scrinia,</hi> under
his Name: For Dr. <hi>Rawley</hi> professed, that
though they were not wholly False, yet
they were very corrupt and embased Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies.
This I believe the rather, having
lately compar'd some Original Letters with
the Copies in that Collection, and found
them imperfect. And to make a particular
Instance; in comparing the Letter of Sir
<hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> to Sir <hi>Robert Car,</hi> of whom
a Fame had gone that he had begg'd his
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48001:45"/>
Estate; I found no fewer then forty Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
of which some were of moment.</p>
                  <p>Our Author hath been still worse dealt
with, in a Pamphlet in <hi>Octavo,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Trial of the <hi>Earl</hi> and <hi>Countess</hi> of
<hi>Somerset:</hi> And likewise in one in <hi>Quarto,</hi>
which beareth the Title of <hi>Bacon's Remains,</hi>
though there cannot be spied in it, so
much as the <hi>Ruines</hi> of his beautiful Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</p>
                  <p>His Lordship, and other such memorable
Writers, having formerly been subject to
such Abuses; it is probable that many will,
at first, suspect the faithfulness of this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection;
and look upon that as adulterate
Ware, which is of such a sudden here
brought forth to them, out of the Dark.</p>
                  <p>But let them first make trial, and then
pass Sentence. And if they have suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
knowledg of the peculiar <hi>Air</hi> of this
Author, they will not only believe that
these <hi>Remains</hi> are his, but also set a value
upon them as none of his most useless and
wast Papers. They say, the Feather of
a <hi>Phoenix</hi> is of price: And here such will
own, they have some little of the Body, as
well as part of the Plumage.</p>
                  <p>It is difficult to imitate such great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
in so lively and exact a form, as
without suspicion, to pass for them. They
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48001:45"/>
who are the most artificial Counterfeits in
this way, do not resemble them as the Son
does the Father, but at best, as the dead
Picture does the living Person. And those
who have true skill in the Works of the
Lord <hi>Verulam,</hi> like great Masters in Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
can tell by the <hi>Design,</hi> the <hi>Strength,</hi>
the <hi>way of Colouring,</hi> whether he was the
Author of this or the other Piece, though
his Name be not to it.</p>
                  <p>For the Reader, who has been less ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in his Books, he may understand, that
nothing is here offered to him as the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi>
of that <hi>Lord,</hi> which was not written
either by his own Hand, or in Copies tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
by the most faithful Pen of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestic
<hi>Chaplain,</hi> Dr. <hi>William Rawley:</hi> A
Person whom his Lordship chiefly us'd in
his Life-time, in Writing down, Transcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing,
Digesting, and Publishing his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posures;
and to whom, at his death, he
expressed his Favour, by bequeathing to
him in Money, One Hundred Pounds,
and in Books, the great <hi>Bibles</hi> of the <hi>King
of Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I refer him, who doubteth of my Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
in this Matter, to my worthy Friend
Mr. <hi>Iohn Rawley,</hi> (the Executor of the
said Reverend Doctor) by whose care
most of these Papers have been preserved
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48001:46"/>
for the public Good; and who can bear
me witness, (if occasion serveth) that I
have not herein impos'd upon the World.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that Dr. <hi>Rawley,</hi> in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
to the <hi>Opuscula</hi> of his Lordship, hath
forbidden us to expect any more of his
<hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>mains</hi> in <hi>Latine,</hi> or <hi>English:</hi> He addeth
in express Terms, that nothing further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in his Hands. He meant, when
he said this, that such Writings of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
were to be esteemed as not in being,
which were not worthy to appear. This
meaning of his, he more plainly deliver'd
in his Preface to the Collection, called <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suscitatio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There he saith, <q>That he had left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to a future hand, which he found to
be of moment, or communicable to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic,
save only some few <hi>Latine</hi> Works
soon after to be publish'd.</q> He deliver'd
himself from the Obligation of that Promise
in the Year fifty eight; publishing then, with
all due care, those <hi>Latine</hi> Works<note n="e" place="margin">Opus. Posth. Philos. Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logica <hi>F. B. B.</hi> de Ver.</note>. Soon
after, he was accus'd by an obscure Prefacer,
to a new Edition of the <hi>Essays,</hi> in <hi>Octavo,</hi>
as one that had still concealed some of his
Lordship's Philosophical Treasures. In vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of himself from this Censure, I
find him using these words in one of his
papers, wherein he animadverteth on that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48001:46"/>
preface. <q>I have publish'd all I thought
fit, or a well advised Man would have
thought fit to be publish'd by me.</q> He
judged some papers, touching <hi>Matters of
Estate,</hi> to tread too near to the heels of
Truth, and to the times of the Persons
concerned, from which now they are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
remov'd, by the distance of Twenty
Years. He thought his Lord's Letters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his Fall, might be injurious to his
Honour, and cause the old Wounds of it
to bleed anew; whereas if the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of them had not been fresh in the
Minds of many, and in the Books of some,
the Collection of the <hi>Cabala,</hi> had revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
part of it in a corrupt Copy; and the
matter of those Letters is of such a nature,
(as afterwards I shall shew) that it rather
cleareth his Lordship's Fame, than throws
more dirt upon it. For the <hi>Philosophical
Remains,</hi> he judged them unfit to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Press, because they were but
Fragments; and such too, as his Lordship's
last Hand had not rendred Correct.
The excess of Veneration which he had
for his Lordship, inclin'd him to think
nothing worthy to bear his Name, which
was not a Masterpiece. And for this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
If Surreptitious Copies had not moved
him to do his Lordship right by printing
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48001:47"/>
the true ones, we had wanted divers Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
which the World now enjoys, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
with thankfulness. And where the
substance is Gold, Men will readily accept
it, though in the Ore and unrefined: Nor
is it any disparagement to the <hi>Inventory</hi> of
his Lordship's philosophical Goods, if there
are numbred amongst them certain broken
uncoined pieces of valuable Metal.</p>
                  <p>Some few imperfect Papers, about his
Lordship's private Affairs, or of very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
moment in Philosophy, are still kept
where they ought to be, in private Hands.
But those which have been judged worthy
the Light, by those Learned and Prudent
Men whom I have consulted, are now,
with no small Labour, communicated to
the World. For so blotted were some of
the Papers, so torn, so disjoynted, so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed
in Contents of a different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
that the <hi>Sense,</hi> as it now stands, may
seem like <hi>Mercury</hi> reduced to its <hi>proper
Form,</hi> after its divers Shapes and Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutations.</p>
                  <p>Now these <hi>Remains</hi> which I have been
moved to publish, I have digested accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the nature of their Contents, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
them to these several Heads of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
<hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Moral; Physiological;
Medical; Theological;</hi> and <hi>Bibliographical.</hi>
                  </p>

Under the first Head of <hi>Remains, Civil</hi>
and <hi>Moral,</hi> are contained these Papers.</p>
                  <p>The First is, His <hi>Charges</hi> against the

the death of Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The proper place for these <hi>Charges</hi> was,

his, on the Margent of those papers) did
at that time forbear the inserting of them,
lest they should be offensive to some then
alive. Now, more than Sixty Years have

Men, one useful Memorial of Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice:
A Memorial apt to deter Greatness
from a Practice, which if it were common,

At the Trial, some Body, of bad Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
and no better Pen, wrote down
most imperfectly, a little of that which
Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> had spoken, largely and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly
upon this solemn Occasion: And,
in the Year fifty one, (a time of general

The Publisher had the confidence to affirm,
that the Narrative was Collected out of the
Papers of Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi>
                     <note n="i" place="margin">'Tis so said in the Title Page.</note>, which, by

never had seen. But a good Name
in the Title-page, was an useful Bush for
the putting off the crude and unfined Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the Book it self.</p>
                  <p>Little hath the Relator told of much
which was said by Mr. <hi>Attorney;</hi> and that
which he hath told, he hath repeated in
such ill manner, that it is no longer Sir
<hi>Francis Bacon</hi>'s, but his own.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>one Place</hi>
                     <note n="k" place="margin">Pag. 107, 108.</note>, he introduceth Mr.
<hi>Attorney,</hi> speaking thus. <q>This is the
second time since the King's coming these
thirteen Years, that any <hi>Peers</hi> have been
Arraigned, and both these times your
<hi>Grace</hi> hath had the Place of <hi>High Steward.</hi>
The first was <hi>Grey,</hi> and <hi>Cobham;</hi> and
though they were Convicted, yet Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution

                     <q>The first was Revenge, of Treason
against Male-contents; and this of the
particular offence to a private Subject,
against those that have been so high in
the King's Grace and Favour; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
deserves to be written in a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beam:
but his being the best Master in
in the World, hinders him not from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the best King; for <hi>He can as well plain

For he spake that which followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>In all this mean time, the King hath
Reigned in his White Robe, not sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with any one drop of Blood of any of
his <hi>Nobles</hi> of this Kingdom: Nay, such
have been the depths of his Mercy, as
even those Noble-mens Bloods (against
whom the proceeding was at <hi>Winchester)
Cobham</hi> and <hi>Grey,</hi> were attainted and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
but not spilt, or taken away;
but that they remained rather <hi>Spectacles</hi>

                     <q>It is true, that the Objects of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
then, and now, were very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring:
For then it was the Revenge of an
Offence against his own Person and
Crown, and upon Persons that were
Male-contents, and Contraries to the
<hi>State</hi> and <hi>Government:</hi> But now it is the
the Revenge of the Blood and Death of
a particular <hi>Subject,</hi> and the Cry of a
<hi>Prisoner:</hi> It is upon Persons that were
highly in his Favour, whereby his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
to his great Honour hath shewed
to the World, as if it were written with a
Sun-beam, that he is truly the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of him, with whom there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of Persons; That his Affections
Royal are above his Affections Private;
That his Favours and Nearness about
him are not like <hi>Popish Sanctuaries,</hi> to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege
Malefactours; and that his being
the best Master in the World, doth not
let him from being the best King in the
World. His People, on the other side,
may say to themselves, I will lie down
in peace; for God, and the King, and
the Law, protect me against the great

the Speech of Sir <hi>Edward Cook,</hi> a part of
Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi>'s, and (like the worser
sort of Thieves) he does not only rob,
but mangle him. Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> spake
on this manner: <q>My Lords! He is not
the Hunter alone that lets slip the Dog
upon the Deer; but he that <hi>lodges the
Deer,</hi> or rouses him, or puts him out;
or <hi>he that sets a Toyl</hi> that he cannot
escape.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Instead of which, the Relator hath sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted

only that slips the Dog, but he that <hi>loves</hi>
the Toyl, that kills the Deer.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This (I thought) was not unnecessary
to be said in Vindication of Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi>'s

                  <p>The Second Paper is, his Letter to the

Sworn of the Privy-Council to the King.
This I judged fit to bear that other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

                  <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> is, a Letter to the same

with that <hi>other of Submission</hi> in the <hi>Cabala,</hi>
seem to some to blemish his Lordship's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
to others, to clear it: For <hi>in this,</hi>
he appealeth to the King himself, whether
he had not ever found him direct and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
in his Service, so as not once to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked
by him, during Nineteen Years Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.
He sheweth that his Fall was
not the King's Act; and that the Prince
was ready to reach out his Hand to stay him
from falling. In the other he maketh this
profession of his being free from malicious
Injustice. <q>For the Bribery and Gifts
wherewith I am charged, when the Books
of Hearts shall be opened, I hope I shall
not be found to have the troubled Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

                  <p>The <hi>Sixth</hi> is, a Supply of his Collection
of Judicious and Elegant Sentences, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by him <hi>Ornamenta Rationalia.</hi> He also
gave to those Wise and Polite Sayings, the
Title of <hi>Sententiae Stellares;</hi> either because
they were Sentences which deserved to be
pointed to by an Asterisc in the Margent;
or because they much illustrated and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd
a Discourse, in which they were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
in due place and order; as the Stars
in the Firmament, are so many glorious
Ornaments of it, and set off with their
Lustre, the wider and less adorned Spaces.</p>
                  <p>This Collection is either wholly lost,
or thrown into some obscure Corner; but
I fear the first. I have now three Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues
in my Hands, of the unpublish'd
Papers of Sir <hi>Francis Bacon;</hi> all written
by Dr. <hi>Rawley</hi> himself. In every one of
these appears the Title of <hi>Ornamenta Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalia,</hi>
but in the Bundles which came with
those Catalogues, there's not one of those
<hi>Sentences</hi> to be found. I held my self ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48001:51"/>
in some sort, and as I was able, to supply
this defect; it being once in my power to
have preserved this Paper. For a Copy
of it was long since, offer'd me by that
Doctor's only Son, and my dear Friend
(now with God) Mr. <hi>William Rawley,</hi> of
whom, if I say no more, it is the <hi>greatness
of my Grief</hi> for that irreparable loss, which
causeth my <hi>Silence.</hi> I was the more negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in taking a Copy, presuming I might,
upon any occasion, command the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
and because that was then in such
good Hands. Now, there remains nothing
with me, but a general Remembrance of
the quality of that Collection. It consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of divers short Sayings, aptly and smart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expressed, and containing in them much
of good Sense in a little room.</p>
                  <p>These he either made, or took from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
being moved so to do by the same
Reason which caus'd him to gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his <hi>Apothegms,</hi> which (he saith) <hi>he
collected for his Recreation,</hi> his Lordship's
Diversions being of more value than some
Men's Labours. Nor do such <hi>Sentences</hi> and
<hi>Apothegms,</hi> differ much in their Nature.
For <hi>Apothegms</hi> are only somewhat longer,
and fuller of Allusion, and tell the Author,
and the occasion of the <hi>Wise Saying;</hi> and
are but the same Kernel, with the Shell
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48001:51"/>
and Leaf about it. That which he faith
of the one, is true of the other. <q>They
are both <hi>Mucrones Verborum</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">In Preface to his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegms.</hi>
                        </note>, pointed
Speeches, or Goads. <hi>Cicero</hi> (saith he)
calleth them <hi>Salinas,</hi> Salt-pits, that you
may extract Salt out of, and sprinkle it
where you will. They serve to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlaced
in continued Speech: They serve
to be recited, upon occasion, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such <hi>Ornaments</hi> have been noted in all
Ages and Places, and in many Collected.</p>
                  <p>Amongst the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> they had (of
old) the Proverbs of <hi>Agur,</hi> and <hi>Salomon.</hi>

                  <p>In Times more Modern, there have been

                  <p>Amongst the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> we find such
Aenigmatic Proverbial Forms as these;
<hi>He hath a Wing of a Bat.</hi> That is, the Man
is impotent, yet daring; and so like a <hi>Bat,</hi>

                  <p>Amongst the <hi>Romans, Iulius Caesar,</hi> and

and the Sentences of <hi>Laberius,</hi> and also of

                  <p>Some, a-while ago, have gathered and

Last Year, the <hi>Sieur de Laval,</hi> did

St. <hi>Austin</hi>
                     <note n="s" place="margin">Sent. tirées des Oeuvres de <hi>S. Aug. A. Paris,</hi> 1677. in Octavo.</note>. And it is not long since,
<hi>Mounsieur Hache</hi> set forth a whole Folio of
Sentences, Collected out of Twelve of the
<hi>Tomes</hi> of the <hi>Bibliotheca Patrum</hi>
                     <note n="t" place="margin">Sent. ex 12. <hi>Bib. Patr.</hi> tomis selectae per <hi>Fr. Hache,</hi> An. 1666.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Among the <hi>Italians, Spaniards, French,
Dutch, Turks,</hi> (which two last I put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for the alike bluntness and coursness
of their Sayings) there are divers Collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>Apothegms</hi> and Proverbs.</p>
                  <p>Among our <hi>Selves,</hi> we have the like, and
particularly the <hi>Wise Sayings</hi> by Mr. <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
and the <hi>Iacula Prudentum,</hi> in Mr.
<hi>Herbert;</hi> which latter some have been bold
to accuse as having too much Feather, and
too little Point. But the sense of that
Metaphor, may be more truly apply'd to
the Collection call'd <hi>Flores Edvardi Coci</hi>
                     <note n="u" place="margin">By <hi>Tho. Ash.</hi> Lon. 1617. in 16<hi rend="sup">•</hi>.</note>. Those Sayings, as they are represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
without the Context of that Eminent
Lawyer, are like the Flowers in an Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,
of which no Man would put the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality

The use of such little things, no Man
knew better than Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> who
could turn every saying to Advantage;
and if it wanted Lustre in it self, he could
by Art create it, and by setting it well.</p>
                  <p>His own Collection was (as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber)
gathered partly out of his own Store,
and partly from the Ancients, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
'tis supplied out of his own Works,
and the <hi>Mimi</hi> of <hi>Publius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Under the <hi>Second Head</hi> of <hi>Remains Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siological,</hi>
or <hi>Natural,</hi> is contain'd in the
<hi>First place,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>Fragment</hi> of his Lordship's <hi>Abeceda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium
Naturae.</hi> This is commonly said to be
lost, and it is well nigh so, the latter part
of it only remaining. But where the
whole is good, each part is of value. And
Antiquaries who travel in the Dominions
of the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> do not despise the
ancient Statues which they find there,
though <hi>Mahometan</hi> Superstition hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off their Heads.</p>
                  <p>This Work is said to be a <hi>Metaphysical
Piece;</hi> but it is not so, in the strictest sense.
Its principal design is the Partition of
things into their several Classes; a design
which his Lordship brought to more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in his <hi>Organon,</hi> and Book <hi>De Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis
Scientiarum.</hi> And though in it were
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48001:53"/>
handled <hi>Condittons of Being,</hi> yet not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractly
from all Body, but with reference
to it. And therefor his Lordship did not
call it <hi>Abecedarium Hyperphysicum,</hi> but the
<hi>Alphabet of Nature.</hi> And his Lordship gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
express Caution, in his Book of <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement</hi>
                     <note n="w" place="margin">De Augm. Scient. <hi>l. 3. c. 2. p.</hi> 228.</note>, that where he speaks of
Conditions of Entities, which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Transcendental; (such as, <hi>Much, Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
The Same, Divers, Possible, Impossible</hi>)
he be not interpreted in a <hi>Logical,</hi> but
<hi>Physical</hi> Sense. His Lordship was much
averse to high and useless Speculations, and
he was wont to express that Aversness
in the following Comparison. The <hi>Lark</hi>
(said he) is an high flier, and in its flight
does nothing but Sing: But the <hi>Hawk</hi> flies
high, and thence descends and catches its
Prey.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second Paper</hi> about Natural things,
is his Lordship's Inquisition touching the
<hi>Compounding of Metals.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then follow, in the <hi>Third Place,</hi> his
<hi>Articles of Questions, touching Minerals.</hi>
Of these, the first inquireth about the same
Subject with the foregoing Paper; but
finding them distinguish'd by his Lordship,
I have not joyn'd them together.</p>
                  <p>These Questions were turn'd into <hi>Latine,</hi>
and in that Tongue, publish'd by Dr. <hi>Rawley,</hi>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:48001:54"/>
amongst his Lordship's <hi>Opuscula;</hi> but the
<hi>English</hi> Originals are now, the first time
set forth. And having by me three Copies,
I publish them by that one on which his
Lordship had endorsed with his own Hand,
<hi>This is the clean Copy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now these Inquiries being in themselves
Imperfect, and without much Solution of
his Lordship's adjoyn'd; I have here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to them the several Answers of Dr. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verel,</hi>
to whom they were proposed by his
Lordship. It has not been in my power,
as yet, to inform my self duly about this
<hi>Doctor;</hi> but doubtless, he was a <hi>Chymist,</hi>
as those Times went, of the first Order.
It was his Lordship's manner, on divers
mornings, to set down Inquiries for the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Days, in some loose Papers. And
in one of them, I find this, among other
<hi>Memoranda.</hi> 
                     <q>To send to Dr. <hi>Meverel.</hi>
Take Iron and dissolve it in <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi>
and put a Loadstone near it, and see
whether it will extract the Iron: Put also
a Loadstone into the Water, and see
whether it will gather a Crust about it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the Questions of his Lordship a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Minerals, and the Answers of Dr.
<hi>Meverel,</hi> there follows, in the <hi>Fourth
Place,</hi> an <hi>Inquisition</hi> concerning the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
Transmutations, Multiplications, and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48001:54"/>
Effections of Bodies, not hitherto publish'd
in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, in which his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
wrote it<note n="x" place="margin">See D. <hi>R's.</hi> Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among the Opus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula.</note>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> There is annexed a certain
Speech touching the recovery of Drowned
Mineral Works, prepared, as Mr. <hi>Bushel</hi>
saith, for that <hi>Parliament</hi> under which he
fell. His Lordship, no doubt, had such a
Project; and he might prepare a Speech al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
for the Facilitating of it. But that this
is a true Copy of that Speech, I dare not
avouch. His Lordship's Speeches were wont
to be digested into more Method; his
Periods were more round, his Words more
choice, his Allusions more frequent, and
manag'd with more decorum. And as no
Man had greater command of Words, for
the illustration of Matter, than his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
so here he had Matter which refus'd
not to be cloth'd in the best Words.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sixth Paper</hi> about Natural Things,
containeth certain Experiments about <hi>weight
in Air and Water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Seventh</hi> containeth a few Proposals
to the Country-Man, called <hi>Experiments for
Profit.</hi> The <hi>Eighth,</hi> Experiments about
the <hi>Commixture of Liquors.</hi> The <hi>Ninth,</hi> a
Catalogue of <hi>Bodies Attractive and not At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive,</hi>
with Experimental Observations
about them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:48001:55"/>
Under the <hi>Third</hi> Head of <hi>Medical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,</hi>
is contain'd in the <hi>First place,</hi> a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
which he called <hi>Grains of Youth.</hi> In
it he prescribeth divers things, as means to
keep up the Body in its Vigour. Amongst
these is the Receipt of the <hi>Methusalem Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
against the Driness of Age,</hi> which his
Lordship valued and used.</p>
                  <p>Next follows a <hi>Catalogue of Astringents,
Openers, and Cordials,</hi> Instrumental to Health.
Then comes in the <hi>Third place,</hi> an <hi>Extract,</hi>
by his Lordship, for his own use, out of
the <hi>History of Life and Death,</hi> together
with some new Advices in order to Health.</p>
                  <p>Last of all, <hi>there are added</hi> Four Medical
Receipts.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>First</hi> is, his <hi>Lordship's Broth and
Fomentation against the Stone,</hi> which I judg'd
acceptable to the Public, seeing his <hi>Receipt
against the Gout</hi> had been so, though it work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not an Infallible Cure. And here it
may seem strange, that his Lordship does
not mention Spirit of <hi>Nitre,</hi> which he so
often used, and which a very ingenious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimenter

of <hi>Acids</hi> against the Stone.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is, the Receipt of an Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
called by his Lordship, <hi>Vnguentum
Fragrans sive Romanum.</hi> By this he mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
an Unguent which consisteth of <hi>Astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,</hi>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:48001:55"/>
preventing excess of Transpiration;
and <hi>Cordials</hi> comforting the Parts. And
he called it (I suppose) the <hi>Roman Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent,</hi>
because that People did eminently
make use of Baths and Anointings. <q>He
himself held, that the anointing with Oyl,
was one of the most potent Operations

detaining the Spirits within, and prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting
the resolution of them; and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the force of the Air, which is then
most predatory.</q> Yet it was his Lordship's
opinon, that it was best to anoint without
Bathing, though he thought Bathing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Anointing bad.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>Fourth,</hi> are Receipts to
comfort the Stomach. One of them he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
a Secret; and I suppose it might be
communicated to him by Sir <hi>Henry Wotton.</hi>
For Sir <hi>Henry</hi> speaks of his preparation of

                  <p>Under the <hi>Fourth Head,</hi> of <hi>Theological

                  <p>Under the <hi>Fifth Head</hi> of <hi>Bibliographical
Remains,</hi> are contained some of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
own Papers concerning his Works,
and likewise some Letters and Discourses of
others upon the same Subject, together with
a few interspersed Remarks concerning his
Life.</p>
                  <p>His Lordship's Papers are these <hi>Six.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>First</hi> is, a Letter to <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the
Sister of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr, and Wife
to <hi>Frederic,</hi> Prince <hi>Palatine</hi> of the <hi>Rhine;</hi>
a Princess who found so many Thorns in the
Crown of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> She pleased to write
to his Lordship, and he return'd Answer,
and sent along with it as a Present, his
<hi>Discourse of a War with Spain;</hi> though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
came to her Hands, till after his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
Death.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is, a Letter to the <hi>Vniversity</hi>
of <hi>Cambridg,</hi> when he sent them his Book
of the <hi>Advancement of Learning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Third</hi> is, a Letter to the same Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,
upon his sending to them his <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum
Organum:</hi> This he wrote in a loose
sheet of paper; the <hi>former,</hi> in one of the
spare leaves at the beginning of the Book.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> is, a Letter to <hi>Trinity College,</hi>
in <hi>Cambridg</hi> (of which Society he had been a
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48001:56"/>
Member) upon his sending thither the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
Book <hi>De Augmentis Scientiarum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi> is, a Letter to the Bishop of
<hi>Lincoln;</hi> in which I note the goodness of
his Lordship's Nature, whilst he still main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
his Friendship with him, though he
had succeeded him in his place of Lord-Keeper.
For Envy hates every one that
sits in that Chair from whence it self is
fallen.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sixth</hi> is, a Letter to Father <hi>Fulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi>
a Divine (if I mistake not) of the
<hi>Republic of Venice,</hi> and the same who wrote
the Life of his Colleague, the excellent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Paul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Seventh</hi> is, a Letter to the <hi>Marquess
Fiat,</hi> then Embassadour from <hi>France,</hi> soon
after the Marriage betwixt his late <hi>Majesty</hi>
and <hi>Henrietta Maria,</hi> in the knitting of
which he had been employ'd. This <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess</hi>
was the Person, who, impatient of
seeing so Learned a Man, was admitted to
his Lordship when he was very ill, and
confin'd to his Bed; and who saluted him
with this high Compliment: <q>Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
hath been to me hitherto like the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
of which I have often heard and
read, but never saw them before.</q> To
which piece of Courtship, he return'd such
answer, as became a Man in those Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48001:57"/>
                     <q>Sir, the Charity of others,
does liken me to an Angel, but my own
Infirmities tell me I am a Man.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Eighth</hi> is, a Transcript out of his
Lordship's <hi>Will,</hi> concerning his Writings.
There, in particular manner, he commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the Press, the <hi>Felicities</hi> of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth.</hi> This I noted before; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it here again as an Argument of the
Impartiality of his Lordship's Judgment and
Affection. He was zealous in bearing testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
to the wise Administration of the
Public Affairs in those Times, in which
himself advanced little either in Profit, or
Honour. For he was hindred from grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at Court by a great Man, who knew
the slenderness of his Purse, and also fear'd
that if he grew, he might prove Taller
than himself<note n="d" place="margin">See his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Sir <hi>R. C.</hi> in C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him, was the representing of him as
a <hi>Speculator;</hi> though it is plain, no Man
dealt better, and with kinder ways, in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
Business than himself: And it generally
ripened under his Hands.</p>
                  <p>For the Papers written by others, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Lordship and his Labours, they are
these.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>First</hi> is, a Letter from the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of <hi>Oxford,</hi> to his Lordship, upon his
sending to them his Book of <hi>Advancement
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48001:57"/>
of Learning,</hi> in its second, and much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
Edition. It should seem by a Passage
towards the end of this Letter, that the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which his Lordship sent to them, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with his Book, was written (like the
first to the <hi>Vniversity of Cambridg</hi>) in one
of the spare leaves of it, and contain'd
some wholesome Admonitions in order to
the pursuit of its Contents.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is, a Letter from Dr. <hi>Mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waring,</hi>
to Dr. <hi>Rawley,</hi> concering his <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
Confession of Faith.</hi> This is that Dr.
<hi>Maynwaring,</hi> whose Sermon upon <hi>Eccles. 8. 2.
&amp;c.</hi> gave such high Offence, about One
and Fifty Years ago.</p>
                  <p>For some Doctrines, which he noteth in
his Lordship's Confession, the Reader ought
to call to mind, the times in which his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
wrote them, and the distaste of that
Court against the proceedings of <hi>Barnevelt,</hi>
whose State-faction blemish'd his Creed.</p>
                  <p>The rest are, <hi>Letters</hi> of Dr. <hi>Rawley,
Mounsieur Deodate, Isaac Gruter,</hi> touching
the Edition of his Lordship's Works: <hi>An
Account of his Lordship's Life</hi> and <hi>Writings,</hi>
by Sir <hi>William Dugdale,</hi> together with some
new Insertions: <hi>Characters</hi> of his Lordship,
and his <hi>Philosophy,</hi> by Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sprat,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Abraham Cowley.</hi>

All these Papers I have put under the
Title of <hi>Baconiana,</hi> in imitation of those,
who of late, have publish'd some Remains
of Learned Men, and called them, <hi>Thuana,
Scaligerana, Perroniana.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These then are the particular Writings, in
which I have labour'd, and in setting forth
of which, I have undertaken the lower Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of a Prefacer. And I think it more
desireable to write a mean Preface to a
good Book, than to be Author of a mean
Book, though graced with a Preface from
some excellent Pen: As it is more Honour,
with a plain <hi>White Staff,</hi> to go before the
King, than being an unpolish'd Magistrate
of a mean and antiquated Corporation, to
be usher'd forth with a Mace of Silver.</p>

                     <p>IT may please your Grace, my <hi>Lord

Lords the <hi>Peers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I am very glad to hear this unfortunate
Lady doth take this Course, to confess
fully, and freely, and thereby to give
Glory to God, and to Justice. It is (as
I may term it) the Nobleness of an Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to confess; and therefore those meaner
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48001:59"/>
Persons, upon whom Justice passed before,
confessed not, she doth. I know your
Lordships cannot behold her without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion.
Many things may move you, her
Youth, her Person, her Sex, her noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
yea, her Provocations, (if I should
enter into the Cause it self) and Furies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
her; but chiefly her Penitency and
Confession. But Justice is the work of this
Day; the Mercy-Seat was in the inner part
of the Temple; the Throne is publick.
But since this Lady hath by her Confession
prevented my Evidence, and your Verdict;
and that this Day's labour is eased; there
resteth in the Legal Proceeding, but for me
to pray that her Confession may be recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and Judgment thereupon.</p>
                     <p>But because <hi>your Lordships</hi> the Peers are
met, and that this day and to morrow are the
Days that crown all the former Justice; and
that in these great Cases it hath been ever the
manner to respect Honour and Satisfaction,
as well as the ordinary Parts and Forms of
Justice; the Occasion it self admonisheth me,
to give <hi>your Lordships</hi> and the Hearers this
Contentment, as to make Declaration of the
Proceedings of this excellent Work of the
King's Justice, from the beginning to the
end.</p>
                     <p>It may please your Grace, my <hi>Lord High
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48001:59"/>
Steward of England,</hi> this is now the second
time, within the space of thirteen years
Reign of our Happy <hi>Sovereign,</hi> that this
high Tribunal Seat (ordained for the Trial
of <hi>Peers</hi>) hath been opened and erected,
and that with a rare event, supplied and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
by one and the same Person, which
is a great Honour unto you, my <hi>Lord
Steward.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In all this mean time the King hath reigned
in his white Robe, not sprinkled with any
one Drop of the Blood of any of his Nobles
of this Kingdom. Nay, such have been the
Depths of his Mercy, as even those Noble-Mens
Bloods, (against whom the Proceeding
was at <hi>Winchester) Cobham</hi> and <hi>Grey,</hi> were
attainted and corrupted, but not spilt or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away; but that they remained rather
<hi>Spectacles of Iustice</hi> in their continual Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment,
than <hi>Monuments of Iustice</hi> in
the Memory of their Suffering.</p>
                     <p>It is true, that the Objects of his Justice
then and now were very differing; for then
it was the Revenge of an Offence against his
own Person and Crown, and upon Persons
that were Male-Contents, and Contraries to
the State and Government; but now it is
the Revenge of the Blood and Death of a
particular Subject, and the Cry of a Prisoner;
it is upon Persons that were highly in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48001:60"/>
whereby his Majesty, to his great
Honour, hath shewed to the World, as if it
were written in a Sun-beam, that he is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Lieutenant of him <hi>with whom there is
no respect of Persons;</hi> that his Affections
Royal are above his Affections private; that
his Favours, and Nearness about him, are
not like <hi>Popish Sanctuaries,</hi> to privilege
Malefactors; and that his being the best Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
in the World, doth not let him from
being the best King in the World. His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
on the other side, may say to themselves,
I will lie down in Peace, for God, the King,
and the Law, protect me against great and
small. It may be a Discipline also to great
Men, especially such as are swoln in their
Fortunes from small beginnings, that the
King is as well able to level Mountains, as
to fill Vallies, if such be their desert.</p>
                     <p>But to come to the present Case, The
great Frame of Justice <hi>(my Lords)</hi> in this
present Action, hath a <hi>Vault,</hi> and hath a
<hi>Stage:</hi> A <hi>Vault,</hi> wherein these Works of
Darkness were contrived; and a <hi>Stage,</hi>
with Steps, by which it was brought to
Light.</p>
                     <p>For the former of these, I will not lead
your <hi>Lordships</hi> into it, because I will engrieve
nothing against a Penitent, neither will I
open any thing against him that is absent.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48001:60"/>
The one I will give to the Laws of Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the other to the Laws of Justice;
for I shall always serve my Master with a
good and sincere Conscience, and I know
<hi>that</hi> he accepteth best. Therefore I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that till to morrow, and hold my self
to that which I called the <hi>Stage</hi> or <hi>Theater,</hi>
whereunto indeed it may be fitly compared:
for that things were first contained within
the Invisible Judgments of God, as within
a Curtain, and after came forth, and were
acted most worthily by the King, and right
well by his Ministers.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> was murthered by
Poison, <hi>Septemb.</hi> 15. 1613. This foul and
cruel Murder did for a time cry secretly in the
Ears of God; but God gave no answer to
it, otherwise than by that Voice, (which
sometime he useth) which is <hi>Vox Populi,</hi>
the Speech of the People: For there went
then a Murmur that <hi>Overbury</hi> was poisoned;
and yet the same submiss and low Voice of
God (the Speech of the Vulgar People)
was not without a Counter-tenor or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-blast
of the Devil, who is the common
Author both of Murder and Slander; for it
was given out, that <hi>Overbury</hi> was dead of a
foul Disease; and his Body (which they
had made <hi>Corpus Iudaicum</hi> with their Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
so as it had no whole part) must be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48001:61"/>
said to be leprosed with Vice, and so his
Name poisoned as well as his Body. For
as to Dissoluteness, I have not heard the
Gentleman noted with it; his Faults were of
Insolency, Turbulency, and the like of that
kind.</p>
                     <p>Mean time there was some Industry used
(of which I will not now speak) to lull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep
those that were the Revengers of the
Blood, the Father and the Brother of the
Murdered. And in these terms things stood
by the space of two years, during which
time God did so blind the two great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curers,
and dazle them with their Greatness,
and blind and nail fast the Actors and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
with security upon their Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as neither the one looked about them,
nor the other stirred or fled, or were convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away, but remained here still, as under
a privy Arrest of God's Judgments; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as <hi>Franklin,</hi> that should have been
sent over to the <hi>Palsgrave</hi> with good store
of Money, was by God's Providence, and
the Accident of a Marriage of his, diverted
and stayed.</p>
                     <p>But about the beginning of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
the last Summer, God's Judgments
began to come out of their depths. And as
the revealing of Murder is commonly such
as a Man said, <hi>à Domino hoc factum est;</hi> it
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48001:61"/>
is God's work, and it is marvellous in our
eyes: so in this particular it was most admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
for it came forth first by a Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a matter of Courtesy. My Lord of
<hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> that is now with God, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to a Councellor of State, (of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Trust by his place) the late Lieutenant
<note n="*" place="margin">

and worthy Gentleman, and desired
him to know him, and to be acquainted with
him. That Councellor answered him civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That my Lord did him a favour, and
that he should embrace it willingly; but he
must let his Lordship know, that there did
lie a heavy imputation upon the Gentleman,
<hi>Helwisse,</hi> for that Sir <hi>Tho. Overbury,</hi> his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner,
was thought to have come to a violent
and an untimely Death. When this Speech
was reported back by my Lord of <hi>Shrews<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
to <hi>Helwisse, percussit ili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ò animum,</hi> he
was strucken with it, and being a politick
Man, and of likelihood doubting, that the
matter would break forth at one time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and that others might have the start of
him, and thinking to make his own Case by
his own Tale, resolved with himself upon
this occasion, to discover unto my Lord of
<hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and that Councellor, that there
was an Attempt (whereunto he was privy)
to have poisoned <hi>Overbury,</hi> by the hands of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48001:62"/>
his Underkeeper, <hi>Weston;</hi> but that he
checked it, and put it by, and disswaded it.
But then he left it thus, that it was but as an
Attempt, or an untimely Birth, never exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted;
and as if his own Fault had been no
more, but that he was honest in forbidding,
but fearful of revealing, and impeaching or
accusing great Persons. And so with this
fine point thought to save himself.</p>
                     <p>But that Councellor of Estate wisely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering,
that by the Lieutenant's own Tale
it could not be simply a Permission, or
Weakness; for that <hi>Weston</hi> was never displa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the Lieutenant, notwithstanding that
Attempt; and coupling the Sequel by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
thought it matter fit to be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Majesty, by whose appointment. <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wisse</hi>
set down the like Declaration in writing.</p>
                     <p>Upon this Ground the King playeth <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s
part, <hi>gloria Dei celare rem, &amp; gloria
Regis investigare rem,</hi> and sets down certain
Papers of his own hand, which I might
term to be <hi>Claves Iustitiae,</hi> Keys of Justice,
and may serve both for a Precedent for
<hi>Princes</hi> to imitate, and for a Direction for
<hi>Iudges</hi> to follow. And his Majesty carried
the Ballance with a constant and steady hand,
evenly and without prejudice, whether it
were a true Accusation of the one part, or a
Practice and factious Scandal of the other.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48001:62"/>
Which Writing, because I am not able to
express according to the worth thereof, I
will desire your Lordships anon to hear
read.</p>
                     <p>This excellent Foundation of Justice being
laid by his Majesties own hand, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
unto some Councellors to examine
further, who gained some Degrees of Light
from <hi>Weston,</hi> but yet left it imperfect.</p>
                     <p>After it was referred to Sir <hi>Ed. Cook,</hi> Chief
Justice of the Kings Bench, as a Person best
practised in Legal Examinations, who took
a great deal of indefatigable pains in it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
intermission, having (as I have heard
him say) taken at least three hundred Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
in this Business.</p>
                     <p>But these things were not done in a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
I need not speak of them. It is true,
that my Lord Chief Justice, in the dawning
and opening of the Light, finding the matter
touched upon these great Persons, very dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly
became Suitor to the King, to have
greater Persons than his own Rank joined
with him; whereupon your Lordships, my
Lord High Steward of <hi>England,</hi> my Lord
Steward of the King's House, and my Lord
<hi>Zouch,</hi> were joined with him.</p>
                     <p>Neither wanted there (this while) Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
to suppress Testimony, to deface Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
to weaken the Kings Resolution, to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48001:63"/>
slander the Justice, and the like. Nay when
it came to the first solemn Act of Justice,
which was the Arraignment of <hi>Weston,</hi> he
had his lesson to stand mute, which had ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested
the whole Wheel of Justice: but this
dumb Devil, by the means of some discreet
Divines, and the potent Charm of Justice
together, was cast out; neither did this
poisonous Adder stop his Ear to these
Charms, but relented, and yeilded to his
Trial.</p>
                     <p>Then followed the other Proceedings of
Justice against the other Offenders, <hi>Turnor,
Helwisse, Franklin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But all these being but the Organs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of this Fact, (the Actors, and not
the Authors) Justice could not have been
crowned without this last Act against these
great Persons; else <hi>Weston</hi>'s Censure or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
might have been verified, when he
said, <hi>He hoped the small Flies should not be
caught, and the greater escape.</hi> Wherein the
King, being in great straits between the defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of his Houour and of his Creature, hath
(according as he useth to do) chosen the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part, reserving always Mercy to himself.</p>
                     <p>The time also of Justice hath had its true
Motions. The time until this Ladies delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
was due unto Honour, Christianity,
and Humanity, in respect of her great Belly.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48001:63"/>
The time since was due to another kind of
Deliverance too, which was, that some Causes
of Estate which were in the Womb might
likewise be brought forth, not for matter of
Justice, but for Reason of State. Likewise
this last Procrastination of Days had the
like weighty Grounds and Causes.</p>
                     <p>But (my Lords) where I speak of a
Stage, I doubt I hold you upon the Stage
too long. But before I pray Judgment, I
pray your Lordships to hear the Kings Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
read, that you may see how well the
King was inspired, and how nobly he carried
it, that Innocency might not have so much
as Aspersion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Frances,</hi> Countess of <hi>Somerset,</hi> hath
been indicted and arraigned, as acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
before the Fact, for the Murder
and Impoisonment of Sir <hi>Tho. Overbury,</hi>
and hath pleaded guilty, and confesseth
the Indictment: I pray Judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

Earle of Somerset, concerning the
poisoning of Overbury.</head>
                     <p>IT may please your Grace, my Lord
High Steward of <hi>England,</hi> and you my
Lords the Peers; You have here before you
<hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Somerset,</hi> to be tried for his
Life, concerning the procuring and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
to the Impoisonment of Sir <hi>Thomas
Overbury,</hi> then the King's Prisoner in the
Tower of <hi>London,</hi> as an Accessary before
the Fact.</p>
                     <p>I know your Lordships cannot behold
this Nobleman, but you must remember his
great favour with the King, and the great
Place that he hath had and born, and
must be sensible that he is yet of your
Number and Body, a Peer as you are;
so as you cannot cut him off from
your Body but with grief; and therefore
that you will expect from us, that give in the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48001:64"/>
King's Evidence, sound and sufficient matter
of Proof, to satisfy your Honours and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.</p>
                     <p>And for the manner of the Evidence also,
the King our Master (who among his other
Vertues, excelleth in that Vertue of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Throne, which is Justice) hath given
us Commandment that we should not expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate,
nor make Invectives, but materially
pursue the Evidence, as it conduceth to
the Point in question; a matter that (tho
we are glad of so good a Warrant) yet we
should have done of our selves; for far be
it from us, by any strains of Wit or Art to
seek to play Prizes, or to blazo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in Blood, or to carry the Day otherwise
than upon just Grounds. We shall carry
the Lanthorn of Justice (which is the
Evidence) before your Eyes upright, and
be able to save it from being put out with
any Winds of Evasions, or vain Defences,
that is our part; not doubting at all, but
that this Evidence in it self will carry that
force, as it shall little need Vantages or Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations.</p>
                     <p>My Lords, The Course which I shall hold
in delivering that which I shall say (for I
love Order) is this,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:48001:65"/>
                        <hi>First,</hi> I will speak somewhat of the nature
and greatness of the Offence which is now
to be tried, and that the King, however he
might use this Gentleman heretofore, as the
<hi>Signet upon his Finger</hi> (to use the Scripture
Phrase) yet in this Case could not but put
him off, and deliver him into the hands of
Justice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> I will use some few words tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the Nature of the Proofs, which in
such a Case are competent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I will state the Proofs.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>lastly,</hi> I will produce the Proofs,
either out of the Examinations and Matters
in Writing, or Witnesses <hi>viva voce.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the Offence it self; it is of Crimes
(next unto High-Treason) the greatest;
it is the foulest of Fellonies. And take this
Offence with the Circumstances, it hath
three Degrees or Stages; that it is Murder;
that it is Murder by Impoisonment; that it
is Murder committed upon the Kings Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
in the Tower: I might say, that it is
Murder under the Colour of Friendship;
but that is a Circumstance moral, I leave
that to the Evidence it self.</p>
                     <p>For Murder, my Lords, the first Record
of Justice which was in the World was a
Judgment upon Murder, in the person of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48001:65"/>
                        <hi>Adam</hi>'s first born, <hi>Cain:</hi> And though it
were not punished by Death, but with Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
and mark of Ignominy, in respect
of the primogeniture, or of the populati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the World, or other points of God's
secret Will, yet it was adjudged, and was
(as I said) the first Record of Justice. So
it appeareth likewise in Scripture, that the
murder of <hi>Abner</hi> by <hi>Ioab,</hi> though it were
by <hi>David</hi> respited in respect of great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
past, or Reason of State, yet it was
not forgotten. But of this I will say no
more. It was ever admitted, and so ranked
in God's own Tables, that Murder is of
offences between Man and Man (next to
Treason and Disobedience of Authority,
which some Divines have referred to the
First Table, because of the Lieutenancy of
God in Princes and Fathers) the greatest.</p>
                     <p>For Impoisonment, I am sorry it should
be heard of in this Kingdom: It is not <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stri
generis nec sanguinis;</hi> It is an Italian
Crime fit for the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> where
that Person that intoxicateth the <hi>Kings</hi> of
the Earth with his Cup of Poison in Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Doctrine, is many times really and
materially intoxicated and impoisoned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
                     <p>But it hath <hi>three Circumstances,</hi> which
make it grievous beyond other Murders:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48001:66"/>
Whereof the <hi>first</hi> is, That it takes a Man
in full Peace; in God's and the King's
Peace; He thinks no harm, but is comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Nature with Refection and Food: So
that (as the Scripture saith) <hi>His Table is
made a Snare.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>second</hi> is, That it is easily commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and easily concealed; and on the
other side, hardly prevented, and hardly
discovered: For Murder by violence
Princes have Guards, and private Men
have Houses, Attendants, and Arms: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can such Murders be committed but
<hi>cum sonitu,</hi> and with some overt and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Act, that may discover and trace the
Offender. But for Poison, the said Cup it
self of Princes will scarce serve, in regard
of many Poisons, that neither discolour nor
distast; and so passeth without noise or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.</p>
                     <p>And the <hi>last</hi> is, Because it containeth not
only the destruction of the maliced Man,
but of any other; <hi>Quis modo tutus erit?</hi>
For many times the Poison is prepared for
one, and is taken by another: So that Men
die other Mens Deaths; <hi>Concidit infelix
alieno vulnere:</hi> and it is as the Psalm cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
it, <hi>Sagitta nocte volans; The Arrow that
flies by night,</hi> it hath no aim or certainty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="19" facs="tcp:48001:66"/>
Now for the <hi>third Degree</hi> of this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Offence, which is, that it was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
upon the King's Prisoner, who was out
of his own Defence, and meerly in the
King's protection, and for whom the King
and State was a kind of Respondent, it is
a thing that aggravates the Fault much.
For certainly (my Lord of <hi>Somerset</hi>) let
me tell you this, That Sir <hi>Tho. Overbury</hi> is
the first Man that was murdered in the
Tower of <hi>London,</hi> since the murder of the
two young Princes.</p>
                     <p>For the Nature of the Proofs, <hi>your
Lordships</hi> must consider, that Impoisonment,
of Offences is the most secret: So secret, as
if in all Cases of Impoisonment you should
require Testimony, you were as good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
Impunity. I will put Book-Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
                     <p>Who could have impeached <hi>Livia,</hi> by
Testimony, of the impoisoning of the
Figs upon the Tree, which her Husband
was wont, for his pleasure, to gather with
his own hands.</p>
                     <p>Who could have impeached <hi>Parisatis</hi> for
the poisoning of one side of the Knife that
she carved with, and keeping the other side
clean; so that her self did eat of the same
piece of Meat that the Lady did that she
did impoison? The Cases are infinite, (and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48001:67"/>
indeed not fit to be spoken of) of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy
of Impoisonments; But wise Triers
must take upon them, in these secret Cases,
<hi>Solomon's</hi> Spirit, that where there could be
no Witnesses, collected the Act by the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                     <p>But yet we are not to come to one Case:
For that which <hi>your Lordships</hi> are to try,
is not the Act of Impoisonment (for that is
done to your hand) all the World by Law
is concluded, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>t to say that <hi>Overbury</hi> was
impoisoned by <hi>Weston.</hi> But the Question
before you is of the procurement only,
and of the abetting (as the Law termeth
it) as accessary before the Fact: Which
abetting is no more, but to do or use any
Act or Means, which may aid or conduce
unto the Impoisonment.</p>
                     <p>So that it is not the buying or making of
the Poison, or the preparing, or confecting,
or commixing of it, or the giving or send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or laying the Poison, that are the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Acts that do amount unto Abetment.
But if there be any other Act or Means
done or used, to give the opportunity of
Impoisonment, or to facilitate the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it, or to stop or divert any impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that might hinder it, and this be with
an intention, to accomplish and atchieve
the Impoisonment; all these are Abetments,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48001:67"/>
and Accessaries before the Fact. I will put
you a familiar Example. Allow there be a
Conspiracy to murder a Man as he jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
by the ways and it be one Man's part
to draw him forth to that Journey by invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
or by colour of some business; and
another takes upon him to disswade some
Friend of his, whom he had a purpose to
take in his Company, that he be not too
strong to make his defence: And another
hath the part to go along with him, and to
hold him in talk till the first blow be given.
All these <hi>(my Lords)</hi> without scruple are
Abetters to this Murder, though none of
them give the Blow, nor assist to give the
Blow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>My Lords,</hi> he is not the Hunter alone
that lets slip the Dog upon the Deer, but
he that lodges the Deer, or raises him, or
puts him out, or he that sets a Toyle that
he cannot escape, or the like.</p>
                     <p>But this <hi>(my Lords)</hi> little needeth in
this present Case, where there is such a
Chain of Acts of Impoisonment as hath
been seldom seen, and could hardly have
been expected, but that Greatness of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
maketh commonly Grossness in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending.</p>
                     <p>To descend to the Proofs themselves, I
shall keep this course.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:48001:68"/>
                        <hi>First,</hi> I will make a Narrative or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of the Fact it self.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> I will break and distribute
the Proofs, as they concern the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>thirdly,</hi> according to that distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I will produce them, and read
them, or use them.</p>
                     <p>So that there is nothing that I shall say,
but your Lordship (my Lord of <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set</hi>)
shall have three thoughts or cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to answer it: <hi>First,</hi> when I open it,
you may take your aim: <hi>Secondly,</hi> when I
distribute it, you may prepare your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
without confusion: And <hi>lastly,</hi> when
I produce the Witnesses, or Examinations
themselves, you may again ruminate and
readvise how to make your defence. And
this I do the rather, because your Memory
or Understanding may not be oppressed or
overladen with length of Evidence, or with
confusion of order. Nay more, when
your Lordship shall make your Answers in
your time, I will put you in mind (when
cause shall be) of your omissions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First</hi> therefore, for the simple Narrative
of the Fact. Sir <hi>Tho. Overbury,</hi> for a time
was known to have had great Interest, and
great Friendship with my Lord of <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set,</hi>
both in his meaner Fortunes, and after:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48001:68"/>
Insomuch as he was a kind of Oracle of
Direction unto him; and if you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
his own vaunts (being of an insolent
<hi>Thrasonical</hi> disposition) he took upon him,
that the Fortune, Reputation, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of this Gentleman (who is
well known to have had a better Teacher)
proceeded from his Company and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel.</p>
                     <p>And this Friendship rested not only in
Conversation and Business of Court, but
likewise in Communication of Secrets of
Estate. For my Lord of <hi>Somerset,</hi> at
that time, exercising (by his Majesties spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
favour and trust) the Office of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
provisionally, did not forbear to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
<hi>Overbury</hi> with the King's Packets of
Dispatches from all parts, <hi>Spain, France,</hi>
the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> &amp;c. And this not by
glimpses, or now and then rounding in the
Ear for a favour, but in a setled manner:
Packets were sent, sometimes opened by
my Lord, sometimes unbroken unto <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
who perused them, copied, registred
them, made Tables of them as he thought
good: So that I will undertake, the time
was, when <hi>Overbury</hi> knew more of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of State, than the Council Table did.
Nay, they were grown to such an inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as they made a Play of all the World
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48001:69"/>
besides themselves: So as they had <hi>Ciphers
and Iargons</hi> for the King, the Queen, and
all the great Men; things seldom used, but
either by Princes, and their Embassadours
and Ministers, or by such as work and
practise against, or at least upon Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                     <p>But understand me (my Lord) I shall
not charge you this day with any Disloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
only I say this for a foundation, That
there was a great communication of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
between you and <hi>Overbury,</hi> and that
it had relation to Matters of Estate, and
the greatest Causes of this Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>But (my Lords) as it is a principle in
Nature, that the best things are in their
corruption the worst: And the sweetest
Wine makes the sharpest Vinegar: So fell
it out with them, that this excess (as I
may term it) of Friendship, ended in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Hatred on my Lord of <hi>Somerset</hi>'s
part.</p>
                     <p>For it fell out, some twelve months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Overbury</hi>'s imprisonment in the Tower,
that my Lord of <hi>Somerset</hi> was entred into
an unlawful love towards his unfortunate
Lady, then Countess of <hi>Essex;</hi> which went
so far, as it was then secretly projected
(chiefly between my Lord Privy Seal and
my Lord of <hi>Somerset</hi>) to effect a Nullity
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48001:69"/>
in the Marriage with my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi>
and so to proceed to a Marriage with <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Marriage and Purpose did <hi>Overbury</hi>
mainly oppugn, under pretence to do the
true part of a Friend (for that he counted
her an unworthy Woman) but the truth was,
that <hi>Overbury,</hi> who (to speak plainly) had
little that was solid for Religion or Moral
Vertue, but was a Man possessed with Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
and vain Glory, was loth to have
any Partners in the favour of my Lord of
<hi>Somerset,</hi> and specially not the <hi>House of the
Howards,</hi> against whom he had always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
hatred and opposition. So all was
but miserable Bargains of Ambition.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>(my Lords)</hi> that this is no sinister
construction, will well appear unto you,
when you shall hear that <hi>Overbury</hi> makes
his brags to my Lord of <hi>Somerset,</hi> that he
had won him the love of the Lady by his
Letters and Industry: So far was he from
Cases of Conscience in this Matter. And
certainly <hi>(my Lords)</hi> howsoever the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
misery of that poor Gentleman <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
ought somewhat to obliterate his
Faults; yet because we are not now upon
point of Civility, but to discover the Face
of Truth to the Face of Justice: And that
it is material to the true understanding of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48001:70"/>
the state of this Cause, <hi>Overbury</hi> was nought
and corrupt, the Ballades must be amended
for that point,</p>
                     <p>But to proceed, When <hi>Overbury</hi> saw that
he was like to be dispossessed of my Lord
here, whom he had possessed so long, and
by whose Greatness he had promised him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to do wonders; and being a Man of
an unbounded and impetuous spirit, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
not only to disswade, but to deter him
from that Love and Marriage; and finding
him fixed, thought to try stronger Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
supposing that he had my Lord's
Head under his Girdle, in respect of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of Secrets of Estate, or (as he
calls them himself in his Letters, Secrets of
all Natures) and therefore dealt violently
with him, to make him desist, with menaces
of Discovery of Secrets, and the like.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon grew two streams of hatred
upon <hi>Overbury; The one</hi> from the Lady, in
respect that he crossed her Love, and abused
her Name, which are Furies to Women;
<hi>The other</hi> of a deeper and more Mineral
Nature from my Lord of <hi>Somerset</hi> himself;
who was afraid of <hi>Overbury</hi>'s Nature, and
that if he did break from him and fly out,
he would mine into him, and trouble his
whole Fortunes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:48001:70"/>
I might add a <hi>third</hi> stream from the Earl
of <hi>Northampton</hi>'s Ambition, who desires to
be first in favour with my Lord of <hi>Somerset,</hi>
and knowing <hi>Overbury</hi>'s malice to himself,
and his House, thought that Man must be
removed and cut off. So it was amongst
them resolved and decreed, that <hi>Overbury</hi>
must die.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon they had variety of Devices.
To send him beyond Sea, upon occasion of
Employment, that was too weak; and
they were so far from giving way to it, as
they crost it. There rested but two ways,
Quarrel or Assault, and Poison. For that
of Assault, after some proposition and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
they passed from it; It was a thing
too open, and subject to more variety of
chances. That of Poison likewise was a
hazardous thing, and subject to many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
and cautions, especially to such a
jealous and working Brain as <hi>Overbury</hi> had,
except he were first fast in their hands.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the way was first to get him
into a Trap, and lay him up, and then they
could not miss the Mark. Therefore in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of this Plot, it was devised, that
<hi>Overbury</hi> should be designed to some ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Employment in Foreign Parts,
and should under-hand by the Lord of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset</hi>
be encouraged to refuse it; and so
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48001:71"/>
upon that contempt he should be laid Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
in the Tower, and then they
would look he should be close enough, and
Death should be his Bail. Yet were they
not at their end. For they considered, that
if there was not a fit Lieutenant of the
Tower for their purpose, and likewise a
fit under-keeper of <hi>Overbury: First,</hi> They
should meet with many Impediments in
the giving and exhibiting the Poison: <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
They should be exposed to note
and observation, that might discover them:
And <hi>thirdly, Overbury</hi> in the mean time
might write clamorous and furious Letters
to other his Friends, and so all might be
disappointed. And therefore the next
Link of the Chain, was to displace the then
<hi>Lieutenant Waade,</hi> and to place <hi>Helwisse</hi> a
principal Abetter in the Impoisonment:
Again, to displace <hi>Cary,</hi> that was the under-Keeper
in <hi>Waade's time,</hi> and to place <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston,</hi>
who was the principal Actor in the
Impoisonment: And this was done in such
a while (that it may appear to be done, as
it were with one breath) as there were but
fifteen days between the commitment of
<hi>Overbury,</hi> the displacing of <hi>Waade,</hi> the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of <hi>Helwisse,</hi> the displacing of <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ary</hi> the
under-Keeper, the placing of <hi>Weston,</hi> and the
first Poison given two days after.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:48001:71"/>
Then when they had this poor Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in the Tower close Prisoner, where he
could not escape nor stir, where he could
not feed but by their Hands, where he
could not speak nor write but through their
Trunks; then was the time to execute the
last Act of this Tragedy.</p>
                     <p>Then must <hi>Franklin</hi> be purveyour of
the Poisons, and procure five, six, seven
several Potions, to be sure to hit his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion.
Then must Mris <hi>Turner</hi> be the <hi>Say-Mistris</hi>
of the Poisons to try upon poor
Beasts, what's present, and what works at
distance of time! Then must <hi>Weston</hi> be the
Tormenter, and chase him with Poison after
Poison, Poison in Salts, Poison in Meats,
Poison in Sweetmeats, Poison in Medicines
and Vomits, until at last his Body was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
come, by use of Poisons, to the state
that <hi>Mithridate</hi>'s Body was by the use of
Treacle and Preservatives, that the force of
the Poisons were blunted upon him: <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi>
confessing, when he was chid for not
dispatching him, that he had given him
enough to poison twenty Men. <hi>Lastly,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all this asked time, courses were taken
by <hi>Somerset,</hi> both to divert all means of
<hi>Overbury</hi>'s Delivery, and to entertain <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
by continual Letters, partly of Hopes
and Projects for his Delivery, and partly
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48001:72"/>
of other Fables and Negotiations; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
like some kind of Persons (which I
will not name) which keep Men in talk of
Fortune-telling, when they have a felloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
meaning.</p>
                     <p>And this is the true Narrative of this Act
of Impoisonment, which I have summarily
recited.</p>
                     <p>Now for the Distribution of the Proofs,
there are four Heads of Proofs to prove
you guilty (my Lord of <hi>Somerset</hi>) of this
Impoisonment; whereof two are prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to the Imprisonment, the third is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and the fourth is following or subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent:
For it is in Proofs, as it is in Lights;
there is a direct Light, and there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion
of Light, or Back-Light.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>first</hi> Head or Proof thereof is, That
there was a root of Bitterness, a mortal
Malice or Hatred, mixed with deep and
bottomless Fears, that you had towards
Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>second</hi> is, That you were the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Actor, and had your hand in all those
Acts, which did conduce to the Impoison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and which gave opportunity and
means to effect it; and without which the
Impoisonment could never have been, and
which could serve or tend to no other end,
but to the Impoisonment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="31" facs="tcp:48001:72"/>
The <hi>third</hi> is, That your hand was in the
very Impoisonment it self, which is more
than needs to be proved; that you did
direct Poison, that you did deliver
Poison, that you did continually hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to the success of the Impoison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and that you spurred it on, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for dispatch, when you thought it lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>lastly,</hi> That you did all the things
after the Impoisonment, which may detect
a guilty Conscience for the smothering of
it, and avoiding punishment for it, which
can be but of three kinds. That you sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
as much as in you was, Testimony:
That you did deface, and destroy, and clip,
and misdate all Writings that might give
light to the Impoisonment; and that you
did fly to the Altar of Guiltiness, which is a
Pardon, and a Pardon of Murder, and a
Pardon for your Self, and not for your
Lady.</p>
                     <p>In this <hi>(my Lord)</hi> I convert my speech
to you, because I would have you attend
the Points of your Charge, and so of your
Defence the better. And two of these
Heads I have taken to my self, and left
the other two to the King's two Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>first</hi> main part, which is the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48001:73"/>
mortal Hatred coupled with Fear, that was
in my Lord of <hi>Somerset</hi> towards <hi>Overbury,</hi>
although he did palliate it with a great deal
of hypocrisie and dissimulation even to the
end; I shall prove it <hi>(my Lord Steward,</hi>
and you <hi>my Lords and Peers)</hi> manifestly,
by matter both of Oath and Writing. The
root of this Hatred was that that hath cost
many a Man's Life; that is, Fear of disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
Secrets. Secrets (I say) of a high
and dangerous nature; wherein the course
that I will hold shall be this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First;</hi> I will shew that such a Breach
and Malice was between <hi>my Lord</hi> and <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
and that it burst forth into violent
Menaces and Threats on both sides.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly;</hi> That these Secrets were not
light, but of a high nature, for I will give
you the Elevation of the Pole. They were
such as my Lord of <hi>Somerset</hi> for his part had
made a Vow, That <hi>Overbury</hi> should neither
live in Court nor Country. That he had
likewise opened himself, and his own fears
so far, that if <hi>Overbury</hi> ever came forth of
the Tower, either <hi>Overbury</hi> or himself must
die for it. And of <hi>Overbury</hi>'s part, he
had threatned my Lord, That whether he
did live or die, my <hi>Lord</hi>'s shame should
never die, but he would leave him the most
odious Man of the World. And farther
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48001:73"/>
that my Lord was like enough to repent it,
in the place where <hi>Overbury</hi> wrote, which
was the Tower of <hi>London.</hi> He was a true
Prophet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> that: So here in the height of
the Secrets.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly;</hi> I will shew you, that all the
King's Business was by my Lord put into
<hi>Overbury</hi>'s Hands: So as there is work
enough for Secrets, whatsoever they were.
And like Princes Confederates, they had
their <hi>Ciphers</hi> and <hi>Iargons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>lastly;</hi> I will shew you that it is but
a Toy to say that the Malice was only in
respect he spake dishonourbly of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
or for doubt of breaking the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age:
For that <hi>Overbury<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> was a Coadjutor to
that Love, and the Lord of <hi>Somerset</hi> was as
deep in speaking ill of the Lady, as <hi>Overbury.</hi>
And again, it was too late for that Matter,
for the Bargain of the Match was then
made and past. And if it had been no more
but to remove <hi>Overbury</hi> from disturbing of
the Match, it had been an easy matter to
have banded over <hi>Overbury</hi> beyond Seas,
for which they had a fair way; but that
would not serve their turn.</p>
                     <p>And lastly, <hi>Periculum periculo vincitur,</hi>
to go so far as an Impoisonment, must have
a deeper malice than flashes: For the Cause
must bear a proportion to the Effect.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="34" facs="tcp:48001:74"/>
For the next general Head of Proofs,
which consists in Acts preparatory to the
middle Acts, they are in eight several points
of the Compass, as I may term it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First;</hi> That there were devices and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to dispatch <hi>Overbury,</hi> or to overthrow
him, plotted between the Countess of
<hi>Somerset,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Somerset,</hi> and the Earl
of <hi>Northampton,</hi> before they fell upon the
Impoisonment: For always before Men fix
upon a course of Mischief, there be some
rejections; but die he must one way or
other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly;</hi> That my Lord of <hi>Somerset</hi> was
principal Practicer (I must speak it) in a
most perfidious manner, to set a Train or
Trap for <hi>Overbury</hi> to get him into the
Tower; without which they never durst
have attempted the Impoisonment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly;</hi> That the placing of the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<hi>Helwisse</hi> one of the Impoisoners, and
the displacing of <hi>Waade,</hi> was by the means
of my Lord of <hi>Somerset.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly;</hi> That the placing of <hi>Weston</hi> the
under-Keeper, who was the principal Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poisoner,
and the displacing of <hi>Cary,</hi> and
the doing of all this within fifteen days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Overbury</hi>'s Commitment, was by the
means and countenance of my Lord of
<hi>Somerset.</hi> And these two were the active
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48001:74"/>
Instruments of the Impoisonment: And
this was a Business that the Ladies power
could not reach unto.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly;</hi> That because there must be a
time for the Tragedy to be acted, and
chiefly because they would not have the
Poisons work upon the sudden: And for
that the strength of <hi>Overbury</hi>'s Nature, or
the very custom of receiving Poison into
his Body, did overcome the Poisons that
they wrought not so fast, therefore <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
must be held in the Tower. And as
my Lord of <hi>Somerset</hi> got him into the
Trap, so he kept him in, and abused him
with continual hopes of Liberty; and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
all the true and effectual means of
his Liberty, and made light of his Sickness
and Extremities.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly;</hi> That not only the Plot of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>Overbury</hi> into the Tower, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
to hold him and keep him there, but
the strange manner of his close keeping
(being in but for a Contempt) was by
the device and means of my Lord of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset,</hi>
who denied his Father to see him,
denied his Servants that offered to be shut
up close Prisoners with him, and in effect
handled it so, that he was close Prisoner to
all his Friends, and open and exposed to all
his Enemies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="36" facs="tcp:48001:75"/>
                        <hi>Seventhly,</hi> That the Advertisement which
my Lady received from time to time, from
the <hi>Lievtenant</hi> or <hi>Weston,</hi> touching <hi>Overbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s
state of Body or Health, were ever sent
up to the Court, though it were in Progress,
and that from my Lady: such a thirst and
listening this Lord had to hear that he was
dispatched.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lastly,</hi> There was a continual Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to set <hi>Overbury</hi>'s Head on work, that
he should make some recognition to clear
the honour of the Lady; and that he should
become a good Instrument towards her and
her Friends: All which was but entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
For <hi>your Lordships</hi> shall plainly see
divers of my Lord of <hi>Northampton</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
(whose hand was deep in this Business)
written (I must say it) in dark Words and
Clauses; That there was one thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
and another intended; That there
was a real Charge, and there was somewhat
not real; a main drift and a dissimulation.
Nay further, there be some passages which
the <hi>Peers</hi> in their wisdom will discern to
point directly at the Impoisonment.</p>
                     <p>After this Inducement followed the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
it self.</p>

                     <p>YOur worthy <hi>Chancellour</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Chaenc.</hi> Egerton.</note> (I fear)
goeth his last day. God hath hitherto
used to weed out such Servants as grew
not fit for Your <hi>Majesty.</hi> But now He hath
gather'd to Himself one of the choicer
Plants in Your <hi>Majesties Garden.</hi> But Your
<hi>Majesties</hi> Service must not be mortal.</p>
                     <p>Upon this heavy Accident, I pray your
<hi>Majesty,</hi> in all humbleness and sincerity, to
give me leave to use a few words. I must
never forget when I moved your <hi>Majesty</hi>
for the <hi>Attorney's Place,</hi> that it was your
own sole Act, and not my <hi>Lord of Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set</hi>'s;
who, when he knew your <hi>Majesty</hi>
had resolv'd it, thrust himself into the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to gain thanks. And therefore I have
no reason to <hi>pray to Saints.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I shall now again make Oblation to your
<hi>Majesty;</hi> first of my Heart; then of my
Service; thirdly, of my Place of <hi>Attorney;</hi>
and fourthly, of my Place in the <hi>Star-Chamber.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I hope I may be acquitted of Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48001:78"/>
if I think of it; both because my
Father had the Place, which is some civil
inducement to my desire, (and I pray God
your Majesty may have twenty no worse
years than Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had in her
Model after my Father's placing) and
chiefly because the Chancellor's place, after
it went to the Law, was ever conferred upon
some of the Learned Counsel, and never upon
a Judg. For <hi>Audley</hi> was raised from King's
Serjeant; my <hi>Father</hi> from Attorney of the
Wards; <hi>Bromlie</hi> from Sollicitor; <hi>Pucke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
from Queen's Serjeant; <hi>Egerton</hi> from
Master of the Rolls, having newly left the
Attorney's place.—</p>
                     <p>For my self, I can only present your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
with <hi>Gloria in Obsequio;</hi> yet I dare
promise, that if I sit in that Place, your
Business shall not make such short turns up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you as it doth; But when a Direction
is once given, it shall be pursued and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed:
And your Majesty shall only be
troubled with the true Care of a King;
which is to think <hi>what</hi> you would have
done in chief; and not <hi>how</hi> for the Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
                     <p>I do presume also, in respect of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Memory, and that I have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
gracious in the <hi>Lower-House,</hi> I have
some interest in the Gentlemen of <hi>England;</hi>
                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:48001:78"/>
and shall be able to do some good Effect in
rectifying that Body of Parliament, which
is <hi>Cardo Rerum.</hi> For, let me tell your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
That <hi>that part</hi> of the Chancellor's
place, which is to judg in equity between
Party and Party, that same <hi>Regnum Iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ale</hi>
(which since my Father's time is but too
much enlarged) concerneth your Majesty
least, more than the acquitting of your
Conscience for Justice. But it is the <hi>other
Parts</hi> of a <hi>Moderator</hi> amongst your <hi>Council;</hi>
of an <hi>Overseer</hi> over your <hi>Iudges;</hi> of a
<hi>Planter</hi> of fit <hi>Iustices</hi> and <hi>Governors</hi> in the
Country, that importeth your Affairs, and
these Times, most.</p>
                     <p>I will add likewise, that I hope, by my
Care, the <hi>Inventive Part</hi> of your <hi>Council</hi>
will be strengthned; who, now common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
do exercise rather their <hi>Iudgments</hi> than
their <hi>Inventions;</hi> and the <hi>Inventive Part</hi>
cometh from Projectors, and Private Men;
which cannot be so well: In which kind
my <hi>Lord of Salisbury</hi> had a good Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.—</p>
                     <p>To conclude; If I were the Man I would
be, I should hope, that as your Majesty of
late hath won Hearts by Depressing, you
should in this lose no Hearts by Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.
For I see your People can better
skill of <hi>Concretum</hi> than <hi>Abstractum;</hi> and that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48001:79"/>
the Waves of their Affection flow rather
after Persons than Things. So that Acts of
this nature (if this were one) do more
good than twenty Bills of Grace.</p>
                     <p>If God call my <hi>Lord Chancellor,</hi> the
Warrants and Commissions which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
for the taking of <hi>the Seal,</hi> and for
working with it, and for reviving of
Warrants under his Hand, which die with
him, and the like, shall be in readiness.
And in this Time presseth more, because it
is the end of a Term, and almost the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Circuits; so that the <hi>Seal</hi>
cannot stand still. But this may be done
as heretofore, by <hi>Commission,</hi> till your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi>
hath resolved on an <hi>Officer. God</hi> ever
preserve your <hi>Majesty.</hi>

                     <p>IN the midst of my misery, which is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
asswaged by Remembrance than
by Hope; my chiefest worldly comfort is,
to think, That since the time I had the first
Vote of the Commons House of Parliament
for Commissioner of the Union, until the
time that I was this last Parliament, chosen
by both Houses for their Messenger to your
Majesty in the Petition of Religion, (which
two were my first and last Services) I was
ever more so happy as to have my poor
Services graciously accepted by your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
and likewise not to have had any of
them miscarry in my Hands. Neither of
which points I can any ways take to my
self, but ascribe the former to your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie's
Goodness, and the latter to your pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Directions; which I was ever careful
to have and keep. For as I have often said
to your Majesty, I was towards you but as
a Bucket, and a Cistern, to draw forth and
conserve, your self was the Fountain.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48001:80"/>
Unto this comfort of nineteen years pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,
there succeded a comfort even in
my greatest adversity, somewhat of the
same nature; which is, That in those of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
wherewith I was charged, there was
not any one that had special relation to
your Majesty, or any your particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.
For as, towards Almighty
God, there are Offences against the first
and second Table, and yet all against God.
So with the Servants of Kings, there are
Offences more immediate against the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign:
Although all Offences against Law
are also against the King. Unto which
Comfort there is added this Circumstance,
That as my Faults were not against your
Majesty, otherwise than as all Faults are;
so my Fall was not your Majesties Act,
otherwise than as all Acts of Justice are
yours. This I write not to insinuate with
your Majesty, but as a most humble Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to your Majesties gracious remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
how honest and direct you have
ever found me in your Service; whereby
I have an assured belief, that there is in
your Majesties own Princely Thoughts, a
great deal of serenity and clearness to me
your Majesties now prostrate and cast-down
Servant.</p>
                     <p>Neither (my most gracious Sovereign)
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48001:80"/>
do I by this mention of my Services, lay
claim to your Princely Grace and Bounty,
though the priviledg of Calamity doth
bear that form of Petition. I know well,
had they been much more, they had been
but my bounden Duty. Nay, I must also
confess, that they were from time to time,
far above my merit, over and super-rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by your Majesties Benefits which you
heaped upon me. Your Majesty was and
is that Master to me, that raised and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
me nine times; thrice in Dignity,
and six times in Office. The places indeed
were the painfullest of all your Services;
But then they had both Honour and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits:
And the then Profits might have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
my now Honour, if I had been
wise. Neither was your Majesties immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
liberality wanting towards me in some
Gifts, if I may hold them. All this I do
most thankfully acknowledg, and do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
conclude, That for any thing arising
from my self to move your Eye of pity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me, there is much more in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Misery, than in my past Services; save
that the same your Majesties Goodness, that
may give relief to the one, may give value
to the other.</p>
                     <p>And indeed, if it may please your Majesty,
this Theme of my Misery is so plentiful, as
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48001:81"/>
it need not be coupled with any thing else.
I have been some Body by your Majesties
singular and undeserved favour, even the
prime Officer of your Kingdom. Your
Majesties Arm hath been over mine in
Council, when you presided at the Table;
so near I was: I have born your Majesties
Image in Metal, much more in Heart: I was
never in nineteen years Service chidden by
your Majesty, but contrariwise often over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed,
when your Majesty would sometimes
say, I was a good Husband for you, though
none for my self: sometimes, That I had a
way to deal in Business <hi>suavibus modis,</hi> which
was the way which was most according to
your own Heart: And other most gracious
speeches of Affection and Trust, which I
feed on to this day. But why should I
speak of these things which are now va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
but only the better to express the
Downfal?</p>
                     <p>For now it is thus with me: I am a year
and an half old in Misery; though I must
ever acknowledg, not without some mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of your Majesties Grace and Mercy;
For I do not think it possible, that any you
once loved should be totally miserable.
Mine own Means, through mine own Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>providence
are poor and weak, little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than my Father left me. The poor
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48001:81"/>
Things which I have had from your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
are either in Question, or at Courtesy.
My Dignities remain Marks of your Favour,
but Burdens of my present Fortune. The
poor Remnants which I had of my former
Fortunes in Plate or Jewels, I have spread
upon poor Men unto whom I owed, scarce
leaving my self a convenient Subsistence.
So as to conclude, I must pour out my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
before your Majesty, so far as to say,
<hi>Si deseris tu, perimus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But as I can offer to your Majesties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
little arising from my self to move
you, except it be my extream Misery, which
I have truly laid open; so looking up to
your Majesty's own self, I should think I
committed <hi>Cain</hi>'s fault if I should despair.
Your Majesty is a King, whose Heart is as
unscrutable for secret motions of Goodness,
as for depth of Wisdom. You are, Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor-like,
<hi>Factive,</hi> and not <hi>Destructive.</hi> You
are the Prince, in whom hath been ever
noted an aversation against any thing that
savoured of an hard Heart; as, on the
other side, your Princely Eye was wont to
meet with any motion that was made on
the relieving part. Therefore as one that
hath had the happiness to know your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
near hand, I have (most Gracious
Sovereign) Faith enough for a Miracle,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48001:82"/>
much more for a Grace, that your Majesty
will not suffer your poor Creature to be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
defaced, nor blot that Name quite
out of your Book, upon which your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Hand hath been so oft for new Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
and Additions.</p>
                     <p>Unto this degree of compassion, I hope
God above, (of whose Mercy towards me,
both in my Prosperity and Adversity I
have had great Testimonies and Pledges,
though mine own manifold and wretched
unthankfulnesses might have averted them)
will dispose your Princely Heart, already
prepared to all Piety. And why should I not
think, but that <hi>thrice Noble Prince,</hi> who
would have pulled me out of the Fire of a
Sentence, will help to pull me (if I may
use that homely phrase) out of the Mire
of an abject and sordid condition in my last
days: And that <hi>excellent Favorite</hi> of yours,
(the goodness of whose Nature contendeth
with the greatness of his Fortune; and
who counteth it a Prize, a second Prize,
to be a good Friend, after that Prize which
he carrieth to be a good Servant) will kiss
your Hands with joy for any Work of
Piety you shall do for me. And as all
commiserable Persons (especially such as
find their Hearts void of all malice) are apt
to think that all Men pity them; I assure
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48001:82"/>
my self that the Lords of your Council, who
out of their Wisdom and Nobleness, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be sensible of humane Events, will
in this way which I go for the Relief of my
Estate, further and advance your Majesty's
Goodness towards me: For there is, as I
conceive, a kind of Fraternity between
Great Men that are, and those that have
been, being but the several Tenses of one
Verb. Nay, I do further presume, that
both Houses of Parliament will love their
Justice the better, if it end not in my ruin.
For I have been often told, by many of
my Lords, as it were in excusing the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Sentence, that they knew they
left me in good Hands. And your Majesty
knoweth well, I have been all my life long
acceptable to those Assemblies, not by flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
but by moderation, and by honest
expressing of a desire to have all things go
fairly and well.</p>
                     <p>But if it may please your Majesty, (for
Saints I shall give them Reverence, but no
Adoration; my Address is to your Majesty
the Fountain of Goodness) your Majesty
shall, by the Grace of God, not feel that
in Gift, which I shall extreamly feel in
Help: For my Desires are moderate, and
my Courses measured to a Life orderly and
reserved, hoping still to do your Majesty
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48001:83"/>
honour in my way. Only I most humbly
beseech your Majesty, to give me leave to
conclude with those words which Necessity
speaketh: Help me, (dear Sovereign Lord
and Master) and pity me so far, as I that
have born a Bag, be not now in my Age
forced in effect to bear a Wallet; nor I
that desire to live to study, may not be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to study to live. I most humbly crave
pardon of a long Letter, after a long si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
God of Heaven ever bless, preserve,
and prosper your Majesty.</p>

                     <head>Certain Apothegms of the Lord Bacon's,
hitherto unpublished.</head>
                     <p>1. <hi>PLutarch</hi> said well, It is otherwise in
a Common-wealth of <hi>Men</hi> than of
<hi>Bees.</hi> The Hive of a City or Kingdom is
in best condition, when there is least of
noise or Buzze in it.</p>
                     <p>2. The same <hi>Plutarch</hi> said, of Men of
weak Abilities set in Great Place, that they
were <hi>like little Statues</hi> set on <hi>great Bases,</hi>
made to appear the less by their Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>3. He said again; Good <hi>Fame</hi> is like
<hi>Fire.</hi> When you have kindled it, you may
easily preserve it; but if once you extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
it, you will not easily kindle it again;
at least, not make it burn as bright as it
did.</p>
                     <p>4. The Answer of <hi>Apollonius</hi> to <hi>Vespasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
is full of excellent<note n="*" place="margin">This Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegm is also found in his Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, <hi>P.</hi> 107</note> Instruction: <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spasian</hi>
asked him, <hi>What was</hi> Nero's <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw?</hi>
He answered, Nero <hi>could touch and
tune the Harp well; but in Government,
sometimes he used to wind the Pins too high,
sometimes to let them down too low.</hi> And
certain it is, that nothing destroyeth Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48001:84"/>
so much as the unequal and untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enterchange of Power <hi>pressed</hi> too far, and
<hi>relaxed</hi> too much.</p>
                     <p>5. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> seeing Sir <hi>Edward—</hi>
in her Garden, look'd out at her Window,
and asked him in <hi>Italian, What does a Man
think of when he thinks of nothing?</hi> Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
(who had not had the effect of some
of the Queen's Grants so soon as he had
hop'd and desir'd) paused a little, and then
made answer, <hi>Madam, He thinks of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
Promise.</hi> The <hi>Queen</hi> shrunk in her
Head, but was heard to say, <hi>Well, Sir</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<hi>I must not confute you. Anger makes
dull Men witty, but it keeps them poor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. When any Great Officer, Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
or Civil, was to be made, the <hi>Queen</hi>
would enquire after the Piety, Integrity,
Learning of the Man. And when she was
satisfied in these Qualifications, she would
consider of his Personage. And upon
such an Occasion she pleas'd once to say to
me, <hi>Bacon,</hi> How can the <hi>Magistrate</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his Authority when the <hi>Man</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spis'd?</p>
                     <p>7. In <hi>Eighty Eight,</hi> when the <hi>Queen</hi> went
from <hi>Temple-Bar</hi> along <hi>Fleetstreet,</hi> the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
were rank'd on one side, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
of the City on the other; said Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Bacon</hi> to a Lawyer that stood next him,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48001:84"/>
do but observe the Courtiers. If they
bow first to the Citizens, they are in Debt;
if first to us, they are in Law.</p>
                     <p>8. King <hi>Iames</hi> was wont to be very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
with the Country Gentlemen to go
from <hi>London</hi> to their Country Houses.
And sometimes he would say <hi>thus</hi> to them;
Gentlemen, at <hi>London</hi> you are <hi>like Ships
in a Sea,</hi> which show like nothing; but in
your Country Villages, you are like <hi>Ships
in a River,</hi> which look like great things.</p>
                     <p>9. Soon after the death of a great Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,
who was judged no advancer of the
King's Matters, the King said to his Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<hi>Bacon,</hi> who was his Kinsman; Now tell
me truly, what say you of your Cousin
that is gone? Mr. <hi>Bacon</hi> answered, Sir,
since your Majesty doth charge me, I'le
e'ne deal plainly with you, and give you
such a character of him, as if I were to
write his Story. I do think he was no fit
Counsellor to make your Affairs better;
but yet he was fit to have kept them from
growing worse. The King said, <hi>On my
So'l, Man, in the first thou speakest like a
True Man, and in the latter like a Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10. King <hi>Iames,</hi> as he was a Prince of great
Judgment, so he was a Prince of a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
pleasant humour; and there now come
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48001:85"/>
into my mind two instances of it.</p>
                     <p>As he was going through <hi>Lusen</hi> by <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi>
he ask'd what Town it was? they
said, <hi>Lusen.</hi> He ask'd a good while after,
What Town is this we are now in? They
said, still 'twas <hi>Lusen. On my So'l,</hi> said
the King, <hi>I will be King of</hi> Lusen.</p>
                     <p>11. In some other of his Progresses, he
ask'd how far 'twas to a Town whose name
I have forgotten; they said, <hi>Six miles.</hi> Half
an hour after he ask'd again; one said, <hi>Six
miles and an half:</hi> The King alighted out
of his Coach, and crept under the Shoulder
of his Led Horse. And when some ask'd
his Majesty what he meant; <hi>I must stalk,</hi>
said he, <hi>for yonder Town is shie and flies
me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>12. Count <hi>Gondomar</hi> sent a Complement
to my Lord St. <hi>Albans,</hi> wishing him <hi>a good
Easter.</hi> My Lord thank'd the Messenger,
and said, He could not at present requite
the <hi>Count</hi> better, than in returning him

                     <p>13. My Lord Chancellor <hi>Elsmere,</hi> when
he had read a Petition which he dislik'd,
would say; <hi>What! you would have my hand
to this now?</hi> And the Party answering, yes;
He would say further; <hi>Well, so you shall.
Nay, you shall have both my hands to't.</hi> And
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48001:85"/>
so would, <hi>with both his hands,</hi> tear it in
pieces.</p>
                     <p>14. I knew a<note n="*" place="margin">See this also in his Essay of Dispatch, <hi>p.</hi> 143.</note> 
                        <hi>Wise Man,</hi> that had it

                     </p>
                     <p>15. Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> was wont to say
of an angry Man who suppressed his Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
That <hi>he thought worse than he spake:</hi>
and of an angry Man that would chide,
That <hi>he spoke worse than he thought.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>16. <hi>He was wont also to say, That Power
in an ill Man, was like the</hi> Power of a
black Witch; He could do hurt, but no good
with it. <hi>And he would add, That</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians
could turn Water into Blood, but could
not turn the Blood again to Water.</p>
                     <p>17. When Mr. Attourney <hi>Cook,</hi> in the
Exchequer, gave high words to Sr. <hi>Francis
Bacon,</hi> and stood much upon his higher
Place; Sir <hi>Francis</hi> said to him, <hi>Mr. Attour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney!
The less you speak of your own great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the more I shall think of it; and the
more, the less.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>18. Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> coming into the
Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi>'s Garden, where there were
a great number of Ancient Statues of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Men and Women, made a stand, and
as astonish'd, cryed out, <hi>The Resurrection.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>19. Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> (who was always
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48001:86"/>
for moderate Counsels) when one was
speaking of such a Reformation of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> as would in effect make
it no Church; said thus to him, Sir, The
Subject we talk of is the Eye of <hi>England:</hi>
And <hi>if there be a speck or two in the Eye, we
endeavour to take them off; but he were a
strange Oculist who would pull out the Eye.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>20. The same Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> was
wont to say, That those who left useful
Studies for useless Scholastic Speculations,
were like the <hi>Olympic Gamsters, who ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain'd
from necessary Labours, that they
might be fit for such as were not so.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>21. He likewise often used this Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison.

                        <hi>The Empirical Philosophers</hi> are like
<hi>to Pismires;</hi> they only lay up and use their
Store. <hi>The Rationalists</hi> are like <hi>to Spiders;</hi>

give me a Philosopher, who <hi>like the Bee,</hi>

own virtue.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>22. <hi>The Lord St. Alban,</hi> who was not
overhasty to raise <hi>Theories,</hi> but proceeded
slowly by Experiments, was wont to say to
some Philosophers who would not go his
Pace; <hi>Gentlemen!</hi> Nature <hi>is a Labyrinth,
in which the very hast you move with will make
you lose your way.</hi>

23. The same Lord when he spoke of
the <hi>Dutchmen,</hi> used to say, That we could
not abandon them for <hi>our safety,</hi> nor keep
them for <hi>our profit.</hi> And sometimes he would
express the same sense on this manner; <hi>We
hold the Belgic Lion by the Ears.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>24. The same Lord, when a Gentleman
seem'd not much to approve of his Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to his Retinue, said to him; Sir, <hi>I am all
of a Piece; If the Head be lifted up, the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
parts of the Body must too.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>25. The Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> was wont to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the Advice of the plain old Man at
<hi>Buxton</hi> that sold Beesoms; A proud lazy
young Fellow came to him for a Beesom up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Trust; to whom the <hi>Old Man</hi> said;
Friend! hast thou no Mony? borrow of
thy Back, and borrow of thy Belly; they'l
ne're ask thee again, I shall be dunning thee

any other come that has better Iron than you, he
will be master of all this Gold.</p>
                     <p>27. <hi>Iack Weeks</hi> said of a great Man (just

                        <p>14. That Envy is most malignant which
is like <hi>Cain</hi>'s, who envyed his Brother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his Sacrifice was better accepted,
when there was no body but <hi>God</hi> to look
on.</p>
                        <p>15. The lovers of Great Place are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
of Privateness, even in Age which
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48001:90"/>
requires the Shadow: like old <hi>Townsmen</hi>
that will be still <hi>sitting at their Street-Door,</hi>
though there they offer Age to scorn.</p>
                        <p>16. In Evil, the best condition is, not to
<hi>will;</hi> the next, not to <hi>can.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>17. In great Place, ask counsel of both
Times: of the <hi>Ancient Time,</hi> what is <hi>best;</hi>
and of the <hi>latter Time,</hi> what is <hi>fittest.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>18. As in Nature things move more <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently</hi>
to their <hi>Place,</hi> and <hi>calmly</hi> in their
<hi>Place:</hi> So Virtue in Ambition is <hi>violent;</hi>
in Authority, setled and calm.</p>
                        <p>19. <hi>Boldness</hi> in civil Business, is like
<hi>Pronuntiation</hi> in the Orator of <hi>Demosthenes;</hi>
the first, second, and third thing.</p>
                        <p>20. <hi>Boldness is blind:</hi> wherefore 'tis ill
in <hi>Counsel,</hi> but good in <hi>Execution.</hi> For in
Counsel it is good to <hi>see dangers,</hi> in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<hi>not to see them,</hi> except they be very
great.</p>
                        <p>21. Without <hi>good Nature,</hi> Man is but a
better kind of <hi>Vermin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>22. God never wrought Miracle to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
<hi>Atheism,</hi> because his ordinary Works
convince it.</p>
                        <p>23. The great <hi>Atheists</hi> indeed are <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,</hi>
who are always handling Holy
Things, but without feeling; so as they
must needs be cauteriz'd in the end.</p>
                        <p>24. The Master of <hi>Superstition</hi> is the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48001:91"/>
People. And in all Superstition, wise Men
follow Fools.</p>
                        <p>25. In removing <hi>Superstitions,</hi> care would
be had that (as it fareth in ill Purgings)
<hi>the good be not taken away with the bad,</hi> which
commonly is done, when the <hi>People</hi> is the
<hi>Physician.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>26. He that goeth into a Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he hath some entrance into the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
goeth to <hi>School,</hi> and not to <hi>travel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>27. It is a miserable state of mind (and
yet it is commonly the case of Kings) <hi>to
have few things to desire, and many things to
fear.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>28. Depression of the Nobility may
make a King more <hi>absolute,</hi> but less <hi>safe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>29. All Precepts concerning Kings, are,
in effect, comprehended in these Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances;
<hi>Remember thou art a Man; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
thou art God's Vicegerent.</hi> The one
bridleth their <hi>Power,</hi> and the other their
<hi>Will.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>30. Things will have their <hi>first</hi> or <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi>
agitation. If they be not tossed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Arguments of Counsel,</hi> they will be
tossed upon the <hi>Waves of Fortune.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>31. The true composition of a Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
is rather to be skill'd in his Masters <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness</hi>
than his Nature; for then he is like to
<hi>advise him,</hi> and not to <hi>feed</hi> his humour.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="69" facs="tcp:48001:91"/>
32. Private Opinion is more <hi>free,</hi> but
Opinion before others is more <hi>reverend.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>33. <hi>Fortune</hi> is like a <hi>Market,</hi> where
many times if you stay a little the <hi>price will
fall.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>34. Fortune sometimes turneth the <hi>han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the Bottle,</hi> which is easie to be taken
hold of; and after the <hi>belly,</hi> which is hard
to grasp.</p>
                        <p>35. Generally it is good to commit the
beginning of all great Actions, to <hi>Argus</hi>
with an <hi>hundred Eyes;</hi> and the ends of
them to <hi>Briareus</hi> with an <hi>hundred hands;
first to watch, and then to speed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>36. There's great difference betwixt a
<hi>cunning Man</hi> and a <hi>wise Man.</hi> There be
that can pack the Cards, who yet can't play
well; they are good in <hi>Canvasses</hi> and <hi>Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and yet otherwise mean Men.</p>
                        <p>37. Extreme self-lovers will set a Man's
<hi>House on fire,</hi> tho it were but to <hi>roast their
Eggs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>38. New Things, like Strangers, are
<hi>more admir'd,</hi> and <hi>less favour'd.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>39. It were good that Men in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations,
would follow the Example of
Time it self, which indeed innovateth
<hi>greatly,</hi> but <hi>quietly;</hi> and by degrees scarce
to be perceived.</p>
                        <p>40. They that reverence too much <hi>old
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48001:92"/>
Time,</hi> are but a scorn to <hi>the New.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>41. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Spartans</hi> have
been noted to be of small dispatch. <hi>Mi
venga la muerte de Spagna;</hi> let my death
come from <hi>Spain,</hi> for then it will be sure
to be long a coming.</p>
                        <p>42. You had better take, for Business, a
Man somewhat <hi>absurd,</hi> than <hi>overformal.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>43. Those who want Friends to whom
to open their Griefs, are Cannibals of their
own Hearts.</p>
                        <p>44. Number it self importeth not much
in Armies, where the People are of weak
courage. For (as <hi>Virgil</hi> says) <hi>it never
troubles a Wolf how many the Sheep be.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>45. Let States, that aim at Greatness,
take heed how their Nobility and Gentry
multiply too fast. In <hi>Coppice Woods,</hi> if you
leave your <hi>Staddles</hi> too <hi>thick,</hi> you shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have clean <hi>Vnderwood,</hi> but <hi>Shrubs and
Bushes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>46. A Civil War is like the <hi>heat of a
Feaver;</hi> but a Forreign War is like the
<hi>heat of Exercise,</hi> and serveth to keep the
Body in health.</p>
                        <p>47. <hi>Suspicions</hi> among thoughts, are like
<hi>Bats</hi> among Birds, They ever <hi>fly by twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>48. Base Natures, if they find themselves
once suspected, will never be true.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="71" facs="tcp:48001:92"/>
49. Men ought to find the difference
between <hi>saltness</hi> and <hi>bitterness.</hi> Certainly he
that hath a Satyrical Vein, as he maketh
others afraid of his Wit, so he had need be
afraid of others Memory.</p>
                        <p>50. <hi>Discretion</hi> in Speech is more than
Eloquence.</p>
                        <p>51. Men seem neither well to understand
their <hi>Riches,</hi> nor their <hi>Strength:</hi> of the
former they believe <hi>greater things</hi> than they
should, and of the latter <hi>much less.</hi> And
from hence certain fatal Pillars have boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the progress of Learning.</p>
                        <p>52. <hi>Riches</hi> are the <hi>Baggage</hi> of Vertue;
they can't be spar'd, nor left behind, but
they hinder the <hi>march.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>53. Great <hi>Riches</hi> have <hi>sold</hi> more Men
than ever they have <hi>bought out.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>54. <hi>Riches have Wings;</hi> and sometimes
they fly away of themselves, and sometimes
they must be set flying to bring in more.</p>
                        <p>55. He that defers his Charity 'till he is
dead, is (if a Man weighs it rightly) rather
liberal of another Man's, than of his own.</p>
                        <p>56. <hi>Ambition</hi> is like <hi>Choler;</hi> if it can
move, it makes Men <hi>active;</hi> if it be stop'd,
it becomes adust, and makes Men <hi>melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>57. To take a Souldier without Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is to pull off his Spurs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="72" facs="tcp:48001:93"/>
58. Some ambitious Men seem as Skreens
to Princes in matters of <hi>Danger</hi> and <hi>Envy.</hi>
For no Man will take such parts, except he
be like the <hi>Seeld Dove,</hi> that mounts and
mounts because he cannot see about him.</p>
                        <p>59. Princes and States should chuse such
Ministers as are more sensible of <hi>Duty</hi> than
<hi>Rising;</hi> and should discern a <hi>busy Nature</hi>
from a <hi>willing Mind.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>60. A Man's Nature <hi>runs</hi> either to <hi>Herbs</hi>
or Weeds; Therefore let him seasonably
water the one, and destroy the other.</p>
                        <p>61. If a Man look sharply and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
he shall see <hi>Fortune;</hi> for though she
be <hi>blind,</hi> she is not <hi>invisible.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>62. <hi>Vsury</hi> bringeth the Treasure of a
Realm or State into few hands: For the
Usurer being at certainties, and others at
uncertainties; at the end of the Game, <hi>most
of the Mony will be in the Box.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>63. Beauty is best in a Body that hath
rather <hi>dignity of Presence,</hi> than <hi>beauty of
Aspect.</hi> The beautiful prove accomplish'd,
but not of great Spirit; and study, for the
most part, rather <hi>Behaviour</hi> than <hi>Vertue.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>64. The best part of Beauty, is that which
a Picture cannot express.</p>
                        <p>65. He who builds <hi>a fair House</hi> upon an
<hi>ill</hi> Seat, commits himself to <hi>Prison.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>66. If you will work on any Man, you
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48001:93"/>
must either know his <hi>Nature</hi> and Fashions,
and so <hi>lead him;</hi> or his <hi>Ends,</hi> and so <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade</hi>

have interest in him, and so govern him.</p>
                        <p>67. Costly Followers (among whom we
may reckon those who are importunate in
Suits) are not to be liked; lest while a
Man maketh his Train longer, he maketh
his Wings shorter.</p>
                        <p>68. Fame is like a River that beareth up
things light and swollen, and drowns things
weighty and solid.</p>
                        <p>69. Seneca <hi>saith well, That</hi> Anger is like
Rain, which breaks it self upon that it falls.</p>
                        <p>70. Excusations, Cessions, Modesty it
self well govern'd, are but Arts of Osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                        <p>71. High Treason is not written in Ice;
that when the <hi>Body</hi> relenteth, the <hi>Impression</hi>
should go away.</p>
                        <p>72. The best Governments are always
subject to be like the fairest <hi>Crystals;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
every <hi>Isicle</hi> or <hi>Grain</hi> is seen; which, in a
fouler Stone is never perceiv'd.</p>
                        <p>73. Hollow Church Papists are like the

not; but yet they bear all the stinging
Leaves.</p>

                     <head>Inquisitions touching the Compounding of
Metals, by Sir Francis Bacon,
Baron of Verulam.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>TO make proof of the Incorporation of Iron
with Flint, or other Stone.</hi> For if it
can be incorporated without over-great
charge, or other incommodity, the cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Flint or Stone, doth make the
Compound Stuff profitable for divers Uses.
The Doubts may be three in number.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First;</hi> Whether they will incorporate at
all, otherwise than to a Body that will not
hold well together but become brittle and
uneven?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly;</hi> Although it should incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
well, yet whether the Stuff will not
be so stubborn as it will not work well
with a Hammer, whereby the charge in
working will overthrow the cheapness of
the material?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly;</hi> Whether they will incorporate,
except the Iron and Stone be first calcined
into Pouder? And if not, Whether the
charge of the Calcination will not eat out
the cheapness of the material?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="93" facs="tcp:48001:103"/>
The <hi>Vses</hi> are most probable to be; <hi>First</hi>
for the Implements of the Kitching; as
Spits, Ranges, Cobirons, Pots, <hi>&amp;c. then</hi>
for the Wars, as Ordinance, Portcullasses,
Grates, Chains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Note; The finer Works of Iron are not
so probable to be served with such a Stuff;
as Locks, Clocks, small Chains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Stuff is not like to be tough
enough.</p>
                     <p>For the better use in comparison of Iron,
it is like the Stuff will be far <hi>lighter;</hi> for
the weight of Iron to Flint, is double and
a third part; and, secondly, it is like to
rust not so easily, but to be <hi>more clean.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ways of tryal are two. <hi>First;</hi> By
the Iron and Stone of themselves, wherein
it must be inquired, What are the Stones
that do easiliest melt. <hi>Secondly;</hi> With an
Additament, wherein Brimstone is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to help to the melting of Iron or Steel.
But then it must be considered, Whether
the Charge of the Additament will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the Profit.</p>
                     <p>It must be known also what proportion
of the Stone the Iron will receive to incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate
well with it, and that with once
melting; for if either the proportion be
too small, or that it cannot be received but
peece-meal by several meltings, the Work
cannot be of value.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="94" facs="tcp:48001:104"/>
                        <hi>To make proof of the incorporating of Iron
and Brass.</hi> For the cheapness of the Iron
in comparison of the Brass, if the Uses
may be served, doth promise Profit.
The Doubt will be, touching their incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating:
for that it is approved, that Iron
will not incorporate, neither with Brass
nor other Metals of it self by simple fire:
So as the inquiry must be upon the Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and the Additament, and the charge
of them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Vses</hi> will be for such things as are
now made of Brass, and might be as well
served by the compound Stuff; wherein
the Doubts will be chiefly of the toughness
and of the beauty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First;</hi> Therefore, if Brass Ordinance
could be made of the compound Stuff, in
respect of the cheapness of the Iron, it
would be of great use.</p>
                     <p>The Vantage which Brass Ordinance hath
over Iron, is chiefly, as I suppose, because
it will hold the blow, though it be driven
far thinner than the Iron can be, whereby
it saveth both in the quantity of the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
and in the charge and commodity of
mounting &amp;carriage, in regard by reason of
the thinness it beareth much less weight:
there may be also somewhat in being not so
easily overheated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:48001:104"/>
                        <hi>Secondly;</hi> For the Beauty; those things
wherein the beauty or luster are esteemed,
are, Andirons, and all manner of Images,
and Statues, and Columns, and Tombs, and
the like. So as the <hi>doubt</hi> will be <hi>double</hi> for
the Beauty; the <hi>one</hi> whether the colour
will please so well, because it will not be so
like Gold as Brass? the <hi>other,</hi> whether it
will pollish so well? Wherein for the latter
it is probable it will; for Steel glosses are
more resplendant than the like Plates of
Brass would be; and so is the glittering of
a Blade. And besides, I take it, Andiron
Brass, which they call White Brass, hath
some mixture of Tin to help the luster.
And for the Golden Colour, it may be by
some small mixture of Orpiment, such as
they use to Brass in the Yellow Alchymy,
will easily recover that which the Iron
loseth. Of this the Eye must be the Judg
upon proof made.</p>
                     <p>But now for Pans, Pots, Curfues, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and the like; the beauty will not be
so much respected, so as the compound
Stuff is like to pass.</p>
                     <p>For the better use of the compound Stuff,
it will be sweeter and cleaner than Brass
alone, which yieldeth a smell or soilness,
and therefore may be better for the Vessels
of the Kitchen and Brewing. It will also
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48001:105"/>
be harder than Brass where hardness may
be required.</p>
                     <p>For the tryal, the <hi>Doubts</hi> will be <hi>two:
First;</hi> The over-weight of Brass towards
Iron, which will make Iron float on the top
in the melting. This perhaps will be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
with the <hi>Calaminar Stone,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth
so well with Brass, and as I take it,
is lighter than Iron. The <hi>other Doubt</hi> will
be, the stiffness and driness of Iron to melt;
which must be holpen either by <hi>moistning</hi>
the Iron, or opening it. <hi>For the first,</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
some mixture of Lead will help.
Which is as much more liquid than Brass,
as Iron is less liquid. The <hi>opening</hi> may be
holpen by some mixture of Sulphur, so as
the trials would be with Brass, Iron, <hi>Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minar
Stone,</hi> and Sulphur; and then again
with the same composition, and an additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of some Lead; and in all this the Charge
must be considered, whether it eat not out
the Profit of the cheapness of Iron?</p>
                     <p>There be <hi>two Proofs</hi> to be made of <hi>incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
of Metals for magnificence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy.</hi>
The <hi>one</hi> for the <hi>Eye,</hi> and the <hi>other</hi>
for the <hi>Ear.</hi> Statua Metal, and Bell Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
and Trumpet Metal, and String Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;
in all these, though the mixture of
Brass or Copper, should be dearer than the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48001:105"/>
Brass it self, yet the pleasure will advance
the price to profit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First;</hi> Therefore for <hi>Statua-Metal,</hi> see
<hi>Pliny</hi>'s Mixtures, which are almost forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and consider the charge.</p>
                     <p>Try likewise the mixture of Tin in large
proportion with Copper, and observe the
Colour and Beauty, it bein<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> polished. But
chiefly let proof be made of the incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
of Copper or Brass with Glass-Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
for that is cheap, and is like to add a
great glory and shining.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Bell-Metal. First,</hi> It is to be known
what is the Composition which is now in
use. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is probable that it is the
driness of the Metal that doth help the
clearness of the sound, and the moistness
that dulleth it: and therefore the Mixtures
that are probable are Steel, Tin, Glass-Metal.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>String-Metal,</hi> or <hi>Trumpet-Metal,</hi> it is
the same reason; save that Glass-Metal may
not be used, because it will make it too
brittle; and trial may be made with mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Silver, it being but a delicacy with
Iron or Brass.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To make proof of the Incorporation of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and Tin,</hi> in equal quantity, or with two
parts Silver, and one part Tin, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48001:106"/>
whether it be of equal beauty and
luster with pure Silver; and also whether
it yield no soiliness more than Silver? And
again, whether it will indure the ordinary
Fire, which belongeth to Chafing-dishes,
Posnets, and such other Silver Vessels?
And if it do not endure the Fire, yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by some mixture of Iron it may not be
made more fixt? For if it be in Beauty, and
all the Uses aforesaid equal to Silver, it were
a thing of singular profit to the State, and
to all particular Persons, to change Silver
Plate or Vessel into the Compound Stuff,
being a kind of Silver <hi>Electre,</hi> and to turn
the rest into Coin. It may be also questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
Whether the Compound Stuff will
receive gilding as well as Silver, and with
equal luster? It is to be noted, That the
common allay of Silver Coin is Brass, which
doth discolour more, and is not so neat as
Tin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Drownings of Metals</hi> within other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
in such sort as they can never rise
again, is a thing of great profit. For if a
quantity of Silver can be so buried in Gold,
as it will never be reduced again, neither
by Fire, nor parting Waters, nor other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways;
and also that it serve all Uses as well
as pure Gold, it is in effect all one, as if so
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48001:106"/>
much Silver were turned into Gold; only
the weight will discover it: but that taketh
off but half of the profit; for Gold is not
fully double weight to Silver, but Gold is
twelve times price to Silver.</p>
                     <p>The burial must be by one of these two
ways, <hi>either</hi> by the smallness of the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as perhaps fifty to one, which will be
but six pence gains in fifty shillings: or it
must be holpen by somewhat which may
fix the Silver, never to be restored or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour'd
away, when it is incorporated into
such a Mass of Gold; for the less quantity
is ever the harder to sever; and for this
purpose Iron is the likest, or Coppel Stuff,
upon which the Fire hath no power of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The making of Gold</hi> seemeth a thing scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
possible; because Gold is the heaviest of
Metals, and to add Matter is impossible:
and again, to drive Metals into a narrower
room than their natural extent beareth, is
a condensation hardly to be expected. But
to make Silver seemeth more easy, because
both Quick-silver and Lead are weightier
than Silver; so as there needeth only fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and not condensing. The degree un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this that is already known, is infusing of
Quick-silver in a Parchment, or otherwise
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48001:107"/>
in the midst of molten Lead when it cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
for this stupifieth the Quick-silver that
it runneth no more. This trial is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
three ways. <hi>First,</hi> By iterating
the melting of the Lead, to see whether it
will not make the Quick-silver harder and
harder. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To put <hi>Realgar</hi> hot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the midst of the Quick-silver, whereby
it may be condensed, as well from within
as without. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To try it in the midst
of Molten Iron or Molten Steel, which is
a Body more likely to fix the Quick-silver
than Lead. It may be also tried, by incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating
Pouder of Steel, or Copple Dust,
by pouncing into the Quick-silver, and so
to proceed to the stupifying.</p>

                        <hi>Vpon Glass, four things would be put in
proof.</hi> The <hi>first,</hi> means to make the Glass
more Crystalline. The <hi>second,</hi> to make
it more strong for falls, and for fire,
though it come not to the degree to be
malleable. The <hi>third,</hi> to make it coloured
by Tinctures, comparable or exceeding pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Stones. The <hi>fourth,</hi> To make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
Body of Glass and Galletyle; that
is, to have the colour milkey like a <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
being a Stuff between a Procelane
and a Glass.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>first;</hi> It is good first to know
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48001:107"/>
exactly the several Materials, whereof the
Glass in use is made; Window-glass, <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi>
and <hi>Burgundy,</hi> Alehouse-glass, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
drinking-Glass: and then thereupon to
consider what the reason is of the coarseness
or clearness; and from thence to rise to a
consideration how to make some Addita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to the coarser Materials; to raise
them to the whiteness and crystalline splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
of the finest.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>second;</hi> We see Pebbles, and
some other Stones will cut as fine as Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stal,
which if they will melt, may be a
mixture for Glass, and may make it more
tough and more Crystalline. Besides, we
see Metals will vitrify; and perhaps some
portion of the Glass of Metal vitrified,
mixed in the Pot of ordinary Glass-Metal,
will make the whole Mass more tough.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>third;</hi> It were good to have of

                     <p>It is also to be observed, whether any two
Metals which will not mingle of themselves,
will mingle with the help of an other; and
what.</p>

What Compounds will be made of Metal
with Stone and other Fossiles; As Latten
is made with Brass and the <hi>Calaminar</hi> Stone;
As all the Metals incorporate with Vitriol; all
with Iron poudered; all with Flint, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some few of these would be inquired of,
to disclose the nature of the rest.</p>
                     <p>Whether Metals or other Fossiles will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate
with molten Glass, and what Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
it makes?</p>
                     <p>The quantity in the mixture would be
well considered; for some small quantity
perhaps will incorporate, as in the Allays
of Gold and Silver Coin.</p>
                     <p>Upon the Compound Body, three things
are chiefly to be observed; The Colour;
the Fragility or Pliantness; the Volatili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or Fixation, compared with the simple
Bodies.</p>
                     <p>For present use or profit, this is the Rule:
Consider the price of the two simple Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
consider again the dignity of the
one above the other in use; then see if you
can make a Compound that will save more
in price than it will lose in dignity of the
use.</p>
                     <p>As for Example; Consider the price of
Brass-Ordnance; consider again the price of
Iron-Ordnance, and then consider wherein
the Brass-Ordnance doth excel the Iron-Ordnance
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48001:111"/>
in Use: Then if you can make
a Compound of Brass and Iron that will
be near as good in use, and much cheaper
in price, then there is profit both to the
Private, and the Common-wealth. So of
Gold and Silver, the price is double of
twelve: The dignity of Gold above Silver
is not much, the splendor is a like, and more
pleasing to some Eyes, as in Cloth of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
silvered Rapiers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The main dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
is, That Gold bears the Fire, which
Silver doth not, but that is an excellency
in Nature, but it is nothing at all in use;
for any dignity in use I know none, but
that silvering will fully and canker more
than gilding; which if it might be corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with a little mixture of Gold, there is
profit: And I do somewhat marvel that
the latter Ages have lost the Ancient <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrum,</hi>
which was a mixture of Silver with
Gold: whereof I conceive there may be
much use, both in Coin, Plate, and Gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>It is to be noted, That there is in the
version of Metals impossibility, or at least
great difficulty, as in making of Gold, Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
Copper. On the other side, in the
adulterating or counterfeiting of Metals,
there is deceit and villany. But it should
seem there is a middle way, and that is by
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48001:111"/>
new Compounds, if the ways of incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
were well known.</p>
                     <p>What Incorporation or Inbibition Metals
will receive from Vegetables, without being
dissolved in their Substance: As when the
Armorers make their Steel more tough and
pliant, by aspersion of Water or Juice of
Herbs; when Gold being grown somewhat
churlish by recovering, is made more pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
by throwing in shreds of tanned Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or any Leather oiled.</p>
                     <p>Note; That in these and the like shews
of Inbibition, it were good to try by the
Weights whether the weight be increased
or no; for if it be not, it is to be doubted
that there is no inbibition of Substance, but
only that the application of that other Body,
doth dispose and invite the Metal to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
posture of parts than of it self it would
have taken.</p>
                     <p>After the Incorporation of Metals by
simple Colliquefaction, for the better disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of the Nature, and Consents, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
of Metals, it would be likewise tried
by incorporating of their Dissolutions.</p>
                     <p>There is to be observed in those Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
which will not easily incorporate,
what the Effects are: As the Bullition;
the Precipitation to the bottom; the Ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
towards the top; the Suspension in
the midst; and the like.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="110" facs="tcp:48001:112"/>
Note; That the dissents of the Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strual
or strong Waters, may hinder the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation,
as well as the dissents of the
Metals themselves; Therefore where the
<hi>Menstrua</hi> are the same, and yet the Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
followeth not, you may conclude
the Dissent is in the Metals; but where the
<hi>Menstrua</hi> are several, not so certain.</p>

                     <head>The Lord Bacon's Articles of Inquiry
concerning Minerals. The second Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Cross-Row, touching the
separation of Metals and Minerals.</head>
                     <p>SEparation is of three sorts; The <hi>First,</hi>
is the separating of the pure Metal from
the Ore, or Dross, which we call Refining.
The <hi>Second,</hi> is the drawing one Metal or
Mineral out of another, which we call Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting.
The <hi>Third,</hi> Is the separating of
any Metal into his Original, or <hi>Materia Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
or Element, or call them what you
will; which Work we will call <hi>Principia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
For Refining, we are to enquire of
it according to the several Metals; as Gold,
Silver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Incidently we are to inquire
of the First Stone or Ore, or Marcasite of
Metals severally, and what kind of Bodies
they are, and of the degrees of Richness.
Also we are to enquire of the means of
Separating, whether by Fire, parting Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
or otherwise. Also for the manner
of Refining, you are to see how you can
multiply the heat, or hasten the opening,
and so save charge in the Fining.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:48001:114"/>
The means of this in Three manners,
that is to say, In the Blast of the Fire; In
the manner of the Furnace, to multiply
Heat by Union, and Reflection; and by
some Additament, or Medicines which will
help the bodies to open them the sooner.</p>
                     <p>Note the Quickning of the Blast, and
the Multiplying of the Heat in the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,
may be the same for all Metals;
but the Additaments must be several, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Nature of the Metals. Note
again, That if you think that the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
of the Additaments in the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
that you multiply the Ore, the
Work will follow, you may be deceived:
for quantity in the Passive will add more
Resistance, than the same quantity in the
Active will add force.</p>
                     <p>For Extracting, you are to enquire what
Metals contain others, and likewise what
not; As Lead, Silver; Copper, Silver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Note, Although the Charge of Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
should excede the Worth, yet that is
not the matter. For at least it will disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Nature and Possibility, the other may
be thought on afterwards.</p>
                     <p>We are likewise to inquire what the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
are of those Metals which contain
more or less other Metals, and how that
agrees with the poorness or richness of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48001:115"/>
the Metals or Ore in themselves. As the
Lead that contains most Silver is accounted
to be more brittle, and yet otherwise poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in it self.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Principiation,</hi> I cannot affirm whether
there be any such thing or not; and I
think the Chymists make too much ado
about it, but howsoever it be, be it Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Extraction, or a kind of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
by the Fire; it is diligently to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
what Salts, Sulphur, Vitriol, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,
or the like Simple Bodies are to be
found in the several Metals, and in what
quantity.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>Doctor Meverel's Answers to the Lord
Bacon's Questions, touching the sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of Metals and Minerals.</head>
                     <p>1. FOr the <hi>means of Separating.</hi> After
that the Ore is washed, or cleansed
from the Earth, there is nothing simply ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
save only a Wind Furnace well
framed, narrow above and at the Hearth,
in shape Oval, sufficiently fed with Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal
and Ore, in convenient proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="117" facs="tcp:48001:115"/>
For Additions in this First Separation,
I have observed none; the Dross, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
brings, being sufficient. The Refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of Iron observe, that that Iron-Stone
is hardest to melt, which is fullest of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
and that easiest which hath most Dross.
But in Lead, and Tin, the contrary is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Yet in melting of Metals, when they
have been calcined formerly by Fire, or
Strong-Waters, there is good use of Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taments,
as of Borax, Tartar, Armoniac,
and Salt-Peter.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>In Extracting of Metals.</hi> Note, That
Lead and Tin contain Silver. Lead and
Silver contain Gold. Iron contains Brass.
Silver is best separated from Lead, by the
Test. So Gold from Silver. Yet the best
way for that is <hi>Aqua Regia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. <hi>For Principiation.</hi> I can truly and
boldly affirm, that there are no such prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
as <hi>Sal, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> which
can be separated from any perfect Metals.
For every part so separated, may easily be
reduced into perfect Metal without Substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of that, or those principles which
Chymists imagin to be wanting. As sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
you take the Salt of Lead; this Salt,
or, as some name it Sulphur, may be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into perfect Lead, by melting it with
the like quantity of Lead which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48001:116"/>
principles only for it self.</p>
                     <p>I acknowledg that there is Quick-Silver
and Brimstone found in the imperfect Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals;
but those are Nature's remote Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials,
and not the Chymists Principles.
As if you dissolve Antimony by <hi>Aqua Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi>
there will be real Brimstone swimming
upon the Water; as appears by the colour
of the Fire when it is burnt, and by the
smell.</p>

As tinging Silver Yellow, tinging Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
White, and tinging Red, Green,
Blew, especially with keeping the Lustre.</p>

                     </list>
                     <p>For <hi>turning into Rust,</hi> two things are
chiefly to be inquired; By what Corasives
it is done, and into what Colours it turns;
As Lead into White, which they call <hi>Cerus;</hi>
Iron into Yellow, which they call <hi>Crocus
Martis;</hi> Quicksilver into Vermilion; Brass
into Green, which they call Verdigrease.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Calcination,</hi> how every Metal is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined,
and into what kind of Body, and
what is the exquisitest way of Calcination.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Sublimation;</hi> To enquire the manner
of Subliming, and what Metals indure Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liming,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48001:117"/>
and what body the Sublimate
makes.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Precipitation</hi> likewise; by what strong
Water every Metal will precipitate, and
with what Additaments, and in what time,
and into what body.</p>
                     <p>So for <hi>Amalgama,</hi> what Metals will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
it, what are the means to do it, and
what is the manner of the body.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Vitrification</hi> likewise; what Metals
will endure it, what are the means to do
it, into what Colour it turns, and further
where the whole Metal is turned into Glass,
and where the Metal doth but hang in the
Glassy parts; Also what weight the Vitrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
body bears, compared with the Crude
body; Also because Vitrification is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a kind of Death of Metals, what Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trification
will admit of turning back again,
and what not.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Dissolution</hi> into Liquour, we are to
enquire what is the proper <hi>Menstruum</hi> to
dissolve any Metal, and in the Negative,
what will touch upon the one, and not
upon the other, and what several <hi>Menstrua</hi>
will dissolve any Metal, and which most
exactly. <hi>Item</hi> the Process or Motion of
the Dissolution, the manner of rising, boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
vapouring more violent, or more
gentle, causing much heat or less. <hi>Item</hi>
                        <pb n="121" facs="tcp:48001:117"/>
the Quantity or Charge that the strong
Water will bear, and then give over. <hi>Item</hi>
the Colour into which the Liquor will
turn. Above all it is to be enquired, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be any <hi>Menstruum</hi> to dissolve any
Metal that is not Fretting, or Corroding,
and openeth the Body by Sympathie, and
not by Mordacity, or violent Penetrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Sprouting or Branching,</hi> though it be
a thing but transitory, and a kind of Toy
or Pleasure, yet there is a more serious use
of it; for that it discovereth the delicate
Motions of Spirits, when they put forth
and cannot get forth, like unto that which
is in Vegetables.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Induration,</hi> or Mollification; It is
to be enquired what will make Metals har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and harder, and what will make them
softer and softer. And this enquiry tendeth
to two ends: First, for Use; As to make
Iron soft by the Fire makes it Malleable.
Secondly, Because Induration is a degree
towards Fixation, and Mollification to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Volatility, and therefore the Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of them will give light towards the
other.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Tough and Brittle,</hi> they are much of
the same kind, but yet worthy of an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
apart, especially to joyn Hardness
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48001:118"/>
with Toughness, as making Glass malleable,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and making Bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>des strong, to resist
and pierce, and yet not easie to break.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Volatility and Fixation.</hi> It is a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Branch to be enquired: The utmost
degree of Fixation is that whereon no
Fire will work, nor strong Water joyned
with Fire, if there be any such Fixation
possible. The next is when Fire simply
will not work without strong Waters.
The next is by the Test. The next is when
it will indure Fire not blown, or such a
strength of Fire. The next is when it will
not indure, but yet is malleable. The next
is when it is not malleable, but yet is not
fluent, but stupified. So of Volatility,
the utmost degree is when it will flie away
without returning. The next is when it
will flie up, but with ease return. The
next is when it will flie upwards over the
Helm by a kind of Exufflation without
Vapouring. The next is when it will melt,
though not rise. The next is when it will
soften, though not melt. Of all these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
Enquiry is to be made in several
Metals, especially of the more extreme
degrees.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Transmutation,</hi> or Version. If it
be real and true, it is the furthest part of
Art, and would be well distinguished,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48001:118"/>
from Extraction, from Restitution, and
from Adulteration. I hear much of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Iron into Copper; I hear also of the
growth of Lead in weight, which cannot
be without a Conversion of some body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Lead: but whatsoever is of this kind,
and well expressed, is diligently to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
and set down.</p>

                     <head>Doctor Meverel's Answers to the Lord

of Metals and Minerals.</head>
                     <p>1. FOr <hi>Tinctures,</hi> there are none that I
know, but that rich variety which
springs from mixture of Metals with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
or imperfect Minerals.</p>
                     <p>2. The imperfect Metals are subject to
<hi>rust,</hi> all of them except Mercury, which
is made into Vermilion by Solution, or
Calcination. The rest are rusted by any
salt, sowr, or acid Water. Lead into
a white body called <hi>Cerussa.</hi> Iron into a
pale red called <hi>Ferrugo.</hi> Copper is turned
into green, named <hi>Aerugo, Aes Viride.</hi>
Tin into white. But this is not in use, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath it obtained a name.</p>

                        <pb n="124" facs="tcp:48001:119"/>
The Scriptures mention the rust of Gold,
but that's in regard of the Allay.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Calcination.</hi> All Metals may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined
by strong Waters, or by admixtion
of Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
Metals may be Calcined by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of simple Fire; Iron thus calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
is called <hi>Crocus Martis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this is their best way. Gold and
Silver are best calcined by Mercury. Their
Colour is Gray. Lead calcined is very
Red. Copper, duskie Red.</p>
                     <p>4. Metals are <hi>sublimed</hi> by joyning them
with Mercury, or Salts. As Silver with
Mercury, Gold with Sal Armoniac, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury
with Vitriol.</p>
                     <p>5. <hi>Precipitation,</hi> is, when any Metal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dissolved into a strong Water, is bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
down into a Powder by salt Water.
The chiefest in this kind is Oyl of Tartar.</p>
                     <p>6. <hi>Amalgamation,</hi> is the joyning, or mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Mercury with any other of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.
The manner is this, in Gold, the rest

make them hot in a Crusible, and
pour them to one part of Gold made red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hot

7. For <hi>Vitrification.</hi> All the imperfect
Metals may be turned by strong Fire into
Glass, except Mercury; Iron into Green;
Lead into Yellow; Brass into Blew; Tin
into pale Yellow. For Gold and Silver,
I have not known them Vitrified, except
joyned with Antimony. These Glassie bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies

may be dissolved.</p>
                     <p>1. Iron may be dissolved by any tart, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or vitriolated Water, yea, by common
Water, if it be first calcined with Sulphur.
It dissolves in <hi>Aqua forti</hi> with great ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and heat, into ared Liquor, so red as
Blood.</p>
                     <p>2. Lead is fittiest dissolved in Vinegar,
into a pale Yellow, making the Vinegar
very sweet.</p>
                     <p>3. Tin is best dissolved with distilled
Salt-water. It retains the colour of the
<hi>Menstruum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. Copper dissolves as Iron doth, in the
same Liquor, into a Blew.</p>
                     <p>5. Silver hath his proper <hi>Menstruum,</hi>
which is <hi>Aqua fortis.</hi> The colour is Green,
with great heat and ebullition.</p>
                     <p>6. Gold is dissolved with <hi>Aqua Regia,</hi>
into a yellow Liquor, with little heat or
ebullition.</p>

7. Mercury is dissolved with much heat
and boyling, into the same Liquors which
Gold and Silver are. It alters not the colour
of the <hi>Menstruum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note.</hi> Strong Waters may be charged
with half their weight of fixed Metals,
and equal of Mercury; if the Workman
be skilful.</p>
                     <p>9. <hi>Sprouting.</hi> This is an accident of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.
For if the <hi>Menstruum</hi> be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged,
then within short time the Metals
will shoot into certain Crystals.</p>
                     <p>10. For <hi>Induration,</hi> or <hi>Mollification,</hi>
they depend upon the quantity of fixed
Mercury and Sulphur. I have observed
little of them, neither of Toughness nor
Bitterness.</p>

return, either by their extreme Fixings;
as in some Vitrifications, or by extreme
Volatility.</p>
                     <p>It is also to be inquired of the two means
of Reduction; and first by the Fire, which
is but by congregation of Homogenial
parts.</p>
                     <p>The second is, by drawing them down
by some Body that hath consent with them.
As Iron draweth down Copper in Water;
Gold draweth Quick-Silver in vapour;
whatsoever is of this kind, is very diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be inquired.</p>
                     <p>Also it is to be inquired what time, or
age, will reduce without help of fire, or
body.</p>
                     <p>Also it is to be inquired what gives im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment
to Union, or Restitution, which
is sometimes called Mortification; as when
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48001:121"/>
Quick-Silver is mortified with Turpentine,
Spittle, or Butter.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, It is to be inquired how the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

Metal rare; as whether it become not more
churlish, altered in colour, or the like.</p>

                     <head>Certain Experiments, of the Lord Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con's,
about the Commixture of
Liquors only, not Solids, without
Heat or Agitation, but only by simple
Composition, and Settling.</head>
                     <p>SPirit of Wine mingled with common
Water, although it be much lighter
than Oyl, yet so, as if the first fall be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
by means of a Sop, or otherwise, it
stayeth above; and, if it be once min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled,
it severeth not again, as Oyl doth.
Tried with Water coloured with Saffron.</p>
                     <p>Spirit of Wine, mingled with common
Water, hath a kind of clouding, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
shewing no ready Commixture. Tried
with Saffron.</p>
                     <p>A dram of Gold dissolved in <hi>Aqua Regis,</hi>
with a dram of Copper in <hi>Aqua forti</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed,
gave a Green Colour, but no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
motion in the parts. Note, That the
dissolution of the Gold, was twelve parts
Water, to one part Body: And of the
Copper was six parts Water, to one part
Body.</p>

                        <pb n="141" facs="tcp:48001:127"/>
Oyl of Almonds commixed with Spirit
of Wine, severeth, and the Spirit of Wine
remaineth on the top, and the Oyl in the
bottom.</p>
                     <p>Gold dissolved commixed with Spirit of
Wine, a dram of each, doth commix, and
no other apparent alteration.</p>
                     <p>Quick-silver dissolved with Gold dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
a dram of each, doth turn to a moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Liquor, black, and like Smith's water.</p>
                     <p>Note, The dissolution of the Gold was
twelve parts Water, <hi>ut supra,</hi> and one part
Metal: That of Water was two parts, and
one part Metal.</p>
                     <p>Spirit of Wine, and Quick-silver com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed,
a dram of each, at the first shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a white Milky substance at the top, but
soon after mingled.</p>
                     <p>Oyl of Vitriol commixed with Oyl of
Cloves, a dram of each, turneth into a
red dark Colour; and a substance thick,
almost like Pitch: And upon the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
gathereth an extream Heat, not to be
endured by touch.</p>
                     <p>Dissolution of Gold, and Oyl of Vitriol
commixed, a dram of each, gathereth a
great Heat at the first, and darkneth the
Gold, and maketh a thick Yellow.</p>
                     <p>Spirit of Wine, and Oyl of Vitriol, a
dram of each, hardly mingle; the Oyl
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48001:128"/>
of Vitrriol going to the bottom; and the
Spirit of Wine lying above in a Milky sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
It gathereth also a great Heat, and
a sweetness in the Taste.</p>
                     <p>Oyl of Vitriol and dissolution of Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver,
a dram of each; maketh an extream
strife, and casteth up a very gross fume,
and after casteth down a white kind of
Curds, or Sands; and on the top a slimish
substance, and gathereth a great Heat.</p>
                     <p>Oyl of Sulphur, and Oyl of Cloves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed,
a dram of each, turn into a thick
and red-coloured substance; but no such
Heat, as appeared in the Commixture with
the Oyl of Vitriol.</p>
                     <p>Oyl of Petroleum, and Spirit of Wine,
a dram of each, intermingle otherwise than
by Agitation, as Wine and Water do;
and the Petroleum remaineth on the top.</p>
                     <p>Oyl of Vitriol, and Petroleum, a dram
of each, turn into a mouldy Substance,
and gathereth some warmth; there resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

monstrous thick Oyl on the top.</p>
                     <p>Spirit of Wine, and Red-wine Vinegar,
one ounce of each, at the first fall, one of
them remaineth above, but by Agitation
they mingle.</p>
                     <p>Oyl of Vitriol, and Oyl of Almonds,
one ounce of each, mingle not; but the

Oyl of Almonds remaineth above.</p>
                     <p>Spirit of Wine, and Vinegar, an ounce

apparent separation, which might be in
respect of the Colour.</p>
                     <p>Dissolution of Iron, and Oyl of Vitriol,
a dram of each, do first put a Milky sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

                     <p>Spirit of Wine commixed with Milk, a
third part Spirit of Wine, and two parts
Milk, coagulateth little, but mingleth; and
the Spirit swims not above.</p>
                     <p>Milk and Oyl of Almonds mingled, in
equal portions, do hardly incorporate, but
the Oyl cometh above, the Milk being
poured in last; and the Milk appeareth in
some drops, or bubbles.</p>
                     <p>Milk one ounce, Oyl of Vitriol a scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
doth coagulate; the Milk at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom

                     <p>Dissolution of Gum <hi>Tragacanth,</hi> and Oyl
of Sweet Almonds, do not commingle, the
Oyl remaining on the top, till they be stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

It is written without Bitterness, or Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,

But if I be not deceived, it hath Edge e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.
I have yet some Spirits left, and

to the King's Service, and your Majestie's;
for whom I pour out my daily Prayers to
God, that he would give your Majesty

it will much please me to repose in your
Bosom, the Issue which I have lately brought
forth into the World; for otherwise I
should look upon it as an exposed Child.
Let it not trouble you, that the Way in
which I go is new: Such things will of
necessity, happen in the Revolutions of
several Ages. However, the Honour of
the Ancients is secured: That, I mean,
which is due to their Wit. For Faith is
only due to the Word of God, and to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.
Now, for bringing back the
Sciences to Experience, is not a thing to
be done: But to raise them a-new from
Experience, is indeed, a very difficult and
laborious, but not a hopeless Undertaking.

                     <p>I find that the Ancients (as <hi>Cicero, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesthenes,
Plinius Secundus,</hi> and others)
have preserved both their Orations and
their Epistles. In imatation of whom, I
have done the like to my own: Which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless,
I will not publish while I live:
But I have been bold to bequeath them to
your Lordship, and Mr. Chancellor of the
Dutchy. My Speeches (perhaps) you
will think fit to publish: The Letters, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them; touch too much upon late
Matters of State, to be published; yet I
was willing, they should not be lost. I
have also by my Will, erected two
Lectures in Perpetuity, in either Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity

                     <head>A Letter written in Latine, by the Lord
Verulam, to Father Fulgentio, the
Venetian, concerning his Writings;
and now Translated into English by
by the Publisher.</head>
                     <opener>
                        <salute>Most Reverend Father,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>I Must confess my self to be a Letter in
your Debt; but the Excuse which I
have, is too too just. For I was kept from
doing you right by a very sore Disease,
from which I am not yet perfectly deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="197" facs="tcp:48001:155"/>
I am now desirous to communicate to
your Fatherhood, the Designs I have
touching those Writings which I form in
my Head, and begin; not with hope of
bringing them to Perfection, but out of
desire to make Experiment, and because I
am a Servant to Posterity: (For these
things require some Ages for the ripening
of them.)</p>
                     <p>I judg'd it most convenient to have them
Translated in the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue, and to
divide them into certain Tomes.</p>
                     <p>The first Tome consisteth of the Books
of the <hi>Advancement of Learning,</hi> which
(as you understand) are already finish'd,
and publish'd; and contain the <hi>Partition of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi>
which is the <hi>First part of my Instauration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Novum Organum</hi> should have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
follow'd. But I interpos'd my
<hi>Moral and Political Writings,</hi> because they
were more in Readiness.</p>
                     <p>And for them, they are these following.
The first is, <hi>The History of</hi> Henry <hi>the</hi> 7th,
<hi>King of England.</hi> Then follows that Book
which you have call'd in your Tongue,
<hi>Saggi Morali.</hi> But I give a graver name to
that Book; and it is to go under the Title
of <hi>Sermones Fideles,</hi> [Faithful Sayings,]
or <hi>Interiora Rerum,</hi> [The Inside of Things.]
Those <hi>Essayes</hi> will be increased in their
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:48001:156"/>
number, and enlarged in the handling of
them.</p>
                     <p>Also that <hi>Tome</hi> will contain the Book of
the <hi>Wisdom of the Ancients.</hi> And this
Tome (as I said) doth, as it were, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lope,
and doth not stand in the Order of
the <hi>Instauration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After these, shall follow the <hi>Organum
Novum,</hi> to which a second part is yet to
be added, which I have already compriz'd
and measur'd in the Idea of it. And thus,
the <hi>Second Part</hi> of my <hi>Instauration,</hi> will be
finished.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Third Part</hi> of the <hi>Instaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
that is to say, the <hi>Natural History,</hi> it
is plainly a Work for a <hi>King,</hi> or a <hi>Pope;</hi>
or for some <hi>College,</hi> or <hi>Order;</hi> and cannot
be, by Personal Industry, performed as it
ought.</p>
                     <p>Those Portions of it, which have already
seen the Light (to wit, concerning <hi>Winds,</hi>
and touching <hi>Life and Death</hi>). They are
not <hi>pure History,</hi> by reason of the <hi>Axioms,</hi>
and larger <hi>Observations,</hi> which are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.
But they are a kind of <hi>mixed Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,</hi>
composed of <hi>Natural History,</hi> and a
rude and imperfect <hi>Instrument</hi> [or Help]
of the Understanding.</p>
                     <p>And this is the <hi>Fourth Part</hi> of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration.</hi>
Wherefore that Fourth Part
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48001:156"/>
shall follow, and shall contain many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of that <hi>Instrument,</hi> more exact, and
much more fitted to <hi>Rules of Induction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> There shall follow a Book, to
be entitled by us, <hi>Prodromus Philosophiae
Secundae, [The Fore-runner of Secondary
Philosophy].</hi> This shall contain our Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
about <hi>new Axioms,</hi> to be raised from
the Experiments themselves, that they,
which were before as Pillars lying [use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly]
along, may be raised up. And this
we resolve on for the <hi>Fifth Part</hi> of our
<hi>Instauration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Lastly, There is yet behind, the <hi>Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary
Philosophy it self,</hi> which is the <hi>Sixth
Part</hi> of the <hi>Instauration.</hi> Of the perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, I have cast away all hopes; but
in future Ages, perhaps, the Design may
bud again. Notwithstanding, in our <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Meanness</hi> (you see) attempteth

                     <p>And I am, by two Arguments, thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded.</p>

deep and devout <hi>Tract</hi> of your decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Lord;</hi> and send back a few Notes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                     <p>In the first Page, Line 7,<note n="a" place="margin">
                           <hi>That is, in</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suscit. p. 117. l. 8. <hi>to,</hi> for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>in</hi> P. 118.</note> are these
words:</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>I <hi>believe,</hi> that God is so Holy, Pure,
and Jealous, that it is impossible for Him
to be pleased in any <hi>Creature,</hi> though the
Work of his own Hands: So that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Angel, Man,</hi> nor <hi>World,</hi> could
stand, or can stand, one moment in his
Eyes, without beholding the same in the
Face of a <hi>Mediator:</hi> And therefore, that
before Him, with whom all things are
present, the <hi>Lamb of God</hi> was slain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>all Worlds:</hi> Without which eternal
Counsel of his, it was impossible for <hi>Him</hi>
to have descended to any work of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but he should have enjoyed the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:48001:162"/>
blessed and individual Society of <hi>Three
Persons in Godhead, only,</hi> for ever.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Point I have heard some Divines
question, <hi>Whether God, without Christ, did
pour his Love upon the Creature?</hi> And I had,
sometimes, a Dispute with
Dr. <hi>Sharp,</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">The same (I think) who was committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> having taught <hi>Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> his Allusion to the <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Vespers. See <hi>Reliqu. Wotton.</hi> p. 434.</note> of your Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,
who held, that the
<hi>Emanation of the Father's
Love to the Creature, was Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate.</hi>
His Reason, amongst
others, was taken from that Text, <hi>So God
loved the World, that he gave his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Son.</hi> Something of that Point, I have
written amongst my Papers, which on the
suddain, I cannot light upon. But I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that I held the Point in the <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>
and that St. <hi>Austin,</hi> in his Comment
on the Fifth Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
by <hi>Beda,</hi> is strong that way.</p>
                     <p>In Page 2, line the <hi>9th</hi> to the <hi>13th,</hi>

                     <p>—<q>God, by the Reconcilement of the
<hi>Mediator,</hi> turning his Countenance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his <hi>Creatures,</hi> (though not in equal
Light, and Degree) made way unto the
Dispensation of his most holy and <hi>secret</hi>
Will; whereby some of his Creatures might
<hi>stand</hi> and keep their State; others might
(possibly) fall, and be restored; and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:48001:162"/>
others might <hi>fall, and not be restored</hi> in
their Estate, but yet <hi>remain in Being,</hi>
though <hi>under Wrath</hi> and Corruption;
all with respect to the <hi>Mediator:</hi> Which
is the great <hi>Mystery,</hi> and perfect <hi>Center</hi>
of all God's Ways with his Creatures;

Wonders do but serve and refer.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here <hi>absolute Reprobation</hi> seems to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
in that the <hi>Will of God</hi> is made the
Reason of the <hi>Not-restitution</hi> of some:
At least-wise his Lordship seems to say,
that <hi>'twas God's will that some should fall:</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
that may be meant of <hi>Voluntas Permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siva</hi>

the Unity of God and Man in

Church; the <hi>Holy Ghost being the Worker
of both these latter Vnities:</hi> For by the

                     <p>Here two of the Unities are ascribed to
the Holy Ghost. The First seems exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;

                     <p>A Few Days ago, I received your most
acceptable and most desired Letter,
in which, to comfort me for the loss of
your most agreeable Company (of which
I was depriv'd by your sudden leaving the
Town) you make me a new promise of a
near and lasting Friendship. Nothing
could have happened to me more pleasing,
than this Kindness (which I shall diligently
endeavour, to the utmost of my Power,
by all ways of Love and Observance, to
deserve); so much I value your own
Worth, and the ever estimable Memory,
of our most <hi>Illustrious Heroe,</hi> a portion of
whose <hi>Spirit,</hi> resides in your Brest.</p>
                     <p>I so greedily expect the speedy <hi>Edition</hi>
of his <hi>Works,</hi> which you have promised;
that I have already almost devour'd the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:48001:167"/>
whole of it in my Hopes. Suffer not (I
beseech you) any delay by any means, to
obstruct this my earnest desire: Seeing,
especially, it much concerns your self (as
you confess) upon many accounts, to
promote it with all Expedition.</p>
                     <p>My design of a <hi>Translation</hi> of the <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
History,</hi> has not succeeded so happily as
I could wish, as you will perceive by the
<hi>Specimen</hi> which I send to you. Wherefore
I desired him, who had undertaken the
Work, to desist from it, he having done
only that little which you will see in a few
Leaves; whereas he undertook the doing
of the whole, two Years ago. I am not
yet resolv'd about the time of my return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into <hi>France.</hi> I will let you know it e're
I go, and tell you by whom our Letters
may be convey'd to one another. <hi>Farewel.</hi>

Affairs of the Person deceased. Returning

my necessary absence from the <hi>Hague</hi> had

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:48001:170"/>
Argument of such extent, and rendred
difficult by such an heap of things of which
it consists, and for the expressing of which
there is not a supply of words from the
Ancients, <hi>but some of a new stamp, and such
as may serve for present use,</hi> are required)
I intreat you not to deny me the sight of
them: That so I may compare them with
the Corrections which my Brother (now
with God) did make with a very great deal
of pains. But, whether the <hi>truth</hi> of them
answers his diligence, will be best under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by your self, and those few others
by whom such Elegancies can be rightly
judged of.</p>
                     <p>I send you here a Catalogue of those
writings<note n="a" place="margin">These were the Papers which <hi>J. Gruter,</hi> afterwards publish'd, under the title of <hi>Scripta Philosophica.</hi>
                        </note> which I had,
in <hi>MS.</hi> out of the study
of Sir <hi>William Boswel,</hi> and
which I now have by me,
either written by the <hi>Lord
Bacon</hi> himself, or by some <hi>English Amanu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ensis,</hi>
but by him revised; as the same Sir
<hi>Willam Boswel</hi> (who was pleased to admit
me to a most intimate familiarity with him)
did himself tell me. Among my Copies
(as the Catalogue which comes with this
Letter shews) you will find the History of
<hi>rare and dense Bodies,</hi> but imperfect, though
carried on to some length.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="228" facs="tcp:48001:171"/>I had once in my hands, an entire and
thick Volume concerning <hi>Heavy and
Light Bodies,</hi> but consisting only of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
delineation of the <hi>Model,</hi> which the
<hi>Lord Bacon</hi> had framed in his Head, in
<hi>titles of Matters,</hi> without any description
of the Matters themselves. There is here
enclosed, a Copy of that
<hi>Contexture</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">This Letter came to my hands without that Copy. See, in lieu of it, <hi>Topica de Gravi &amp; Levi,</hi> in lib. 5. cap. 3. de <hi>Augm. Scien.</hi>

only the Heads of the

Draught; which supplement I dispair of</p>
                     <p>For the Book of <hi>Dense and Rare Bodies,</hi>
which you have by you, perfected by the
Author's last Hand, as likewise the <hi>Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
which are an <hi>Appendix</hi> to it, I could
wish that they might be here publish'd in
<hi>Holland,</hi> together with those hitherto unpub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
<hi>Philosophical Papers</hi> copied by me, out
of <hi>M S S.</hi> of Sir <hi>William Boswel;</hi> seeing, if
they come out together, they will set off,
and commend one another.</p>
                     <p>I have begun to deal with a <hi>Printer,</hi>
who is a Man of great Diligence and Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity.
I will so order the matter, that you
shall have no reason to complain of my
Fidelity and Candor, if you leave that
Edition to me. Care shall be taken by me,
that it be not done without honourable men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48001:171"/>
of your self. But be it what it will
you shall resolve upon, it shall abate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the offices of our Friendship,
which, from this beginning of it, shall still
further be promoted upon all occasions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lewis Elzevir,</hi> wrote me word lately,
from <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> that he was designed to
begin shortly, an <hi>Edition in Quarto,</hi> of all
the Works of the <hi>Lord Bacon,</hi> in <hi>Latine,</hi>
or <hi>English:</hi> But not of the <hi>English,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the <hi>Translation</hi> of them into <hi>Latine.</hi>
And he desir'd my advice, and any assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
I could give him by <hi>Manuscripts,</hi> or
<hi>Translations;</hi> to the end that, as far as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
those <hi>Works</hi> might come abroad with
advantage, which have been long receiv'd
with the kindest <hi>Elogies,</hi> and with the most
attested Applause of the <hi>Learned World.</hi>
If you have any thing in your <hi>Mind,</hi> or
your <hi>Hands,</hi> whence we may hope for as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
in so famous a Design, and condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
so much to the Honour of those who
are Instrumental in it, pray let me know
it, and reckon me henceforth amongst the
devout Honourers of the name of the <hi>Lord
Bacon,</hi> and of your own Vertues.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="230" facs="tcp:48001:172"/>I expect from you what you know, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Ancestors of the <hi>Lord Bacon,</hi>
especially concerning his <hi>Father, Nicholas
Bacon;</hi> concerning his Youth, his Studies
in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> his Travels, his Honours, his
Office of <hi>Chancellour,</hi> and his deposal from
it by <hi>Sentence</hi> of <hi>Parliament.</hi> The former I
will undertake in a more florid and free
Style, expatiating in his just Praises; the
latter, with a wary Pen, lest out of my
<hi>Commentary</hi> of the Life of this most Learned
Man, matter be offered of pernicious Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,

                     <p>IT is not just to complain of the slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of your Answer, seeing that the
difficulty of the Passage, in the season in
which you wrote, which was towards
Winter, might easily cause it to come no
faster: Seeing likewise, there is so much
to be found in it which may gratifie Desire,
and perhaps, so much the more, the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
it was e're it came to my Hands. And
although I had little to send back, besides my
Thanks for the <hi>little Index,</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">A Note of some Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>'s in <hi>D. R's.</hi> hands.</note> yet that seemed to me of
such moment, that I would
no longer suppress them;
especially because I accounted it a Crime
to have suffer'd Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Of <hi>Christ's Colledg</hi> in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> and Keeper of the publick Library there.</note> to have been without
an Answer: Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> my
most kind Friend, and to
whose care in my Matters, I owe all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:48001:174"/>
and Affection, yet without diminution
of that part (and that no small one nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
in which Dr. <hi>Rawley</hi> hath place: So
that the <hi>Souls</hi> of <hi>us Three</hi> so throughly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing,
may be aptly said to have united
in a <hi>Triga.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though I thought that I had already,
sufficiently shew'd, what Veneration I had
for the <hi>Illustrious Lord Verulam,</hi> yet I shall
take such care for the future, that it may
not possibly be deny'd, that I endeavour'd
most zealously to make this thing known to
the learned World.</p>
                     <p>But neither shall this Design, of setting
forth in one Volume, all the <hi>Lord Bacon</hi>'s
Works, proceed without consulting you,
and without inviting you to cast in your
Symbol, worthy such an excellent Edition:
That so the Appetite of the Reader, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
already by his publish'd Works, may
be further gratifi'd by the pure novelty of
so considerable an Appendage.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>French Interpreter,</hi> who patch'd

                        </note>, and tack'd
that motley piece to him;
they shall not have place in
this <hi>great Collection.</hi> But
yet, I hope, to obtain your leave to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
apart, as an Appendix to the <hi>Natural

History,</hi> that <hi>Exotick Work,</hi> gather'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from this and the other place [of his
Lordships Writings] and by me translated
into <hi>Latine.</hi> For seeing the genuine Pieces
of the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> are already Extant, and
in many Hands, it is necessary that the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Reader be given to understand, of what
Threds the Texture of that Book consists
and how much of Truth there is in that,
which that shameless person does in his
Preface to the Reader, so stupidly write of
you.</p>
                     <p>My Brother, <hi>of blessed Memory,</hi> turn'd
his words into <hi>Latine,</hi> in the <hi>first Edition</hi>
of the <hi>Natural History,</hi> having some suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Fidelity of an unknown Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.
I will, in the <hi>second Edition,</hi> repeat
them, and with just severity, animadvert
upon them: That they, into whose hands
that Work comes, may know it to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positious,
or rather patch'd up of many
distinct Pieces; how much soever the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
bears himself upon the specious Title
of <hi>Verulam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Unless, perhaps, I should particularly
suggest in your Name, that these words
were there inserted, by way of Caution;
and lest Malignity and Rashness should any
way blemish the Fame of so eminent a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>

                     <p>HOw much I hold my self honour'd by
your <hi>Present</hi> of the Lord <hi>Bacon's

had let you understand, if ill For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
in the Passage (which is, for divers
causes, uncertain) had not deluded the
care of a Friend, who did here with much
readiness, undertake the Conveyance of
them.</p>
                     <p>Now, the Gift is by so much the greater,
by how much the more benefit I reap'd by
diligent reading of those Papers, and by
comparing them with some of the Lord

published. For to you we owe the

One Paper I wonder I saw not amongst
them, the <hi>Epistle</hi> of the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> to Sir
<hi>Henry Savil, about the Helps of the Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Powers,</hi> spoken of long ago in your
Letters, under that, or some such Title,
if my Memory does not deceive me. If
it was not forgotten, and remains among
your private Papers, I should be glad to
see a <hi>Copy</hi> of it, in the use of which, my
Faithfulness shall not be wanting. But,
perhaps, it is written in the <hi>English Tongue,</hi>
and is a part of that greater <hi>Volume,</hi> which
contains only his <hi>English Works.</hi> If you
will please to let me understand so much,
and likewise give me assurance of obtaining
that Book, in which the <hi>Speeches,</hi> and it
may be the <hi>Letters</hi> of the Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi>
written by him in <hi>English,</hi> are digested;
you will render your Memory sacred in my
Mind, in the veneration of which, the

shall never be weary. <hi>Farewel.</hi>

                     <p>Of his Death, this is said
<note n="*" place="margin">This Account is inserted by the Publisher, who took it out of a Paper of the Lord <hi>Bacon's.</hi>
                        </note> to be the occasion. <q>He had
his Barber rubbing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
his Head. And, because it
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:48001:179"/>
was very hot, the Window was open to let in a
fresh Wind. He fell asleep, and awaked all
distemper'd, and in a great sweat, Said
he to the Barber, Why did you let me sleep?
Why, my Lord, said he, I durst not wake
your Lordship. Why then, saith my Lord
Keeper, you have killed me with Kindness.
So he removed into his Bed-Chamber, and
within a few days died.</q>

As to his Education, he was<note n="u" place="margin">Ibid.</note> of <hi>Trinity
College,</hi> in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> under the tuition of
Doctor <hi>Iohn Whitgift,</hi> then Master there,
but afterwards the renowned Arch-Bishop

proficiency, spent some time, he was sent
<note n="x" place="margin">Ibid.</note> into <hi>France,</hi> with Sir <hi>Amias Paulet,</hi> her
Majestie's Leiger Ambassador, and thence
intrusted with a Message<note n="y" place="margin">Ibid.</note> to the Queen,
which he performed with much approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and so returned.</p>
                     <p>After this, coming from Travail, and
applying himself to the study of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

that the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
to vex the very Soul

In which few words there are two

                     <p>For first, The King himself sent for the

from; both in pleading the like sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:48001:182"/>
into the hands of some of my
best Friends; and also in an honourable
and answerable Commendation of me,
to her Majesty. Wherein I hope, your
Lordship (if it please you call to mind)
did find me, neither overweening, in
presuming too much upon it, nor much
deceived in my opinion of the Event, for
the continuing of it still in your self; nor
sleepy in doing some good Offices to the
same purpose.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This favour of the Lord <hi>Egerton's,</hi> which
began so early, continued to the last. And
thus much Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> testified in a
Letter to Sir <hi>George Villiers,</hi> of which this
is a part.<note n="b" place="margin">

                        <q>My Lord Chancellor told
me, yesterday, in plain terms, that if the
King would ask his opinion, touching the
Person that he would commend to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
him, upon Death, or Disability;
he would name me, for the fittest Man.
You may advise, whether use may not be
made of this Offer.</q> And the like ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by what Master Attorney wrote to
King <hi>Iames,</hi> during the sickness of my
Lord Chancellor. Amongst other things,
he wrote this to the King.<note n="*" place="margin">Ibid. p. 50.</note> 
                        <q>It pleased my
Lord Chancellor, out of his ancient and
great Love to me, which many times, in
Sickness, appeareth most; to admit me
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:48001:182"/>
to a great deal of Speech with him this
Afternoon; which, during these three
Days, he hath scarcely done to any.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the same<note n="*" place="margin">Court of K. <hi>James, p.</hi> 119.</note> Libel, my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> is
reproach'd as a very necessitous Man, and
one, for that Reason, made Keeper by
the Duke, to serve such Turns, as Men of
better Fortunes would never condescend
to. And this, also, is a groundless and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
Insinuation. He had now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd,
a good while, many profitable
Places, which preserv'd him from Indigence,
though his great Mind did not permit him
to swell his Purse by them, to any extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Bigness. And, in the Queen's time,
when he was in meaner Circumstances, he
did not look upon himself as in that estate
of Necessity, which tempteth generous
Minds to vile things. Hear himself repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
his Condition; no Man knew it
better, or could better express it. Thus
he states his Case in the aforesaid unpub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
Letter to the Lord Chancellor <hi>Eger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
of the whole of which, I sometime had
the perusal, though now much of it is lost,
and, as I believe, beyond all recovery.
<q>My Estate (said he) I confess a truth to
your Lordship, is weak, and Indebted,
and needeth Comfort. For both my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(though, I think, I had greatest
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:48001:183"/>
part in his Love of all his Children)
in his Wisdom served me in, as a last
Comer: And my self, in mine own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,
have rather referred, and aspired
to <hi>Vertue,</hi> than to <hi>Gain;</hi> whereof I am
not yet wise enough to repent me. But
the while, whereas <hi>Salomon</hi> speaketh, <hi>That
Want cometh first as a Wayfaring Man, and
after as an Armed Man;</hi> I must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
my self to be in <hi>primo gradu;</hi> for it
stealeth upon me. But, for the second, that
it should not be able to be resisted; <hi>I hope
in God, I am not in that case.</hi> For the
preventing whereof, as I do depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God's Providence all in all; so in the
same, his Providence I see, opened unto
me, three not unlikely expectations of
Help. The one, my Practice; the other,
some proceeding in the Queen's Service;
the third, the Place I have in Reversion,
which as it standeth now unto me, is but
like another Man's Ground buttalling
upon my House, which may mend my
Prospect, but it doth not fill my Barn.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Place he meaneth, was the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
Office in the Star-Chamber, which fell
to him in the time of King <hi>Iames,</hi> and
was worth about 1600 <hi>l.</hi> by the Year.</p>
                     <p>But to return from this Digression.
When Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> was constituted
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:48001:183"/>
Lord-Keeper, the King admonisht him,
that he should Seal nothing rashly; as also
that he should Judg uprightly, and not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the Royal Prerogative too high. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which, <hi>viz.</hi> upon the seventh Day of
<hi>May,</hi> (which was the first Day of <hi>Easter
Term</hi> next ensuing) he made his solemn
proceeding<note n="c" place="margin">Ibid.</note> to <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> in this
order. First, The Writing Clerks and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Officers belonging to the Court of
Chancery. Next the Students of the Law.
Then the Gentlemen of his own Family.
After them, the Sergeant at Arms, and
bearer of the Great Seal, on foot. Then
himself on Horsback, in a Gown of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Satin, riding betwixt the Lord-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer,
and Lord Privy-Seal. Next divers
Earls, Barons, and Privy-Councellors.
Then the Judges of the Courts at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
whose place in that proceeding, was
assigned after the Privy-Councellors. And
when he came into the Court, the Lord-Treasurer,
and Lord Privy-Seal, gave him
his Oath, the Clerk of the Crown read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it.</p>
                     <p>Upon the fourth of <hi>Ianuary, 16 Iac.</hi>
he was made Lord Chancellor<note n="d" place="margin">Claus. 16 <hi>Jac.</hi> in dorso. p. 15.</note> of <hi>England.</hi>
On the eleventh of <hi>Iuly</hi> next ensuing,
created<note n="e" place="margin">Pat. 16. <hi>Jac.</hi> p. 11.</note> Lord <hi>Verulam,</hi> and on the

<hi>Theobalds;</hi> his Robe carried before him
by the Lord <hi>Carew,</hi> and his Coronet by

the King sevenfold thanks;<note n="h" place="margin">Annal. R. <hi>Jac.</hi> in an. 1621.</note> first, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him his Solicitor; secondly, his Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
thirdly, one of his Privy Council;
fourthly, Lord-Keeper of the Great Seal;
fifthly, Lord-Chancellor; sixthly, Baron <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulam;</hi>
and lastly, Vicount <hi>St. Alban.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But long he enjoyed not that great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Lord-Chancellor: for in <hi>Lent, 18
Iac.</hi> Corruption in the exercise thereof
being objected<note n="i" place="margin">Orig. Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid. in Chr. p. 102.</note> against him, (of which
'tis believed, his Servants were most guilty,
and he himself not much accessory) the
Great Seal was taken<note n="k" place="margin">This is inserted by the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisher.</note> from him.</p>
                     <p>This Fall<note n="l" place="margin">Ibid.</note> he foresaw, yet he made no
shew of that base and mean Spirit, with
which the Libel before remembred, does
unworthily charge him<note n="m" place="margin">Court of K. <hi>James,</hi> 122, 123.</note>. The late King,
of blessed Memory (then Prince) made
a very differing observation upon him.
<q>Returning from Hunting,<note n="n" place="margin">Aul. Coqu. p. 174.</note> he espied a
Coach attended with a goodly Troop of
Horsemen, who, it seems, were gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together to wait upon the Chancellor
to his House at <hi>Gorhambury,</hi> at the time
of his Declension. The Prince smiling,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:48001:184"/>
said, <hi>Well! Do we what we can, this Man
scorns to go out like a Snuff.</hi> And he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
his undaunted Spirit, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Parts, not without some Regret, that
such a Man should be falling off.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is true, that after the Seal was taken
from him, he became a great example of
Penitence and Submission. But it was a
Submission which both manifested his just
sense of his Fault, and the more Venial
Nature of it, as arising from Negligence,
rather than Avarice and Malice.</p>
                     <p>He shewed by it, that there was not in
his Heart that stiffness of Pride, which
openly denies or justifies those Crimes of
which it self is secretly convinced: But
it appeared not by any thing, during all
the time of his Eclipse of Fortune, that
there was any abjectness of Spirit in him.
The many and great Works which he wrote,
shew a mind in him, not distracted with
Anxiety, nor depressed with Shame, nor
slow for want of Encouragement, nor
broken with Discontent. Such a Temper is
inconsistent with such noble Thoughts and
Designs, such strict Attention, such vigour
of Conceit, such a Masculine Style, such
quickness in Composition, as appeared in
his learned Labours.</p>

                        <pb n="256" facs="tcp:48001:185"/>
When the Great Seal was taken from
him, it was committed to the Custody of
<hi>Henry</hi> Vicount <hi>Mandevil,</hi> (at that time

                  <p>THe Lord Chancellor <hi>Bacon,</hi> was a

his Endeavours to the perfecting of the
<hi>Works of Nature;</hi> or rather improving <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
to the best Advantages of Life, and
the common Benefit of Mankind. Pity it
was, he was not entertain'd with some libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Salary, abstracted from all Affairs both
of Court and Judicature, and furnished
with Sufficiency, both of Means and Helps,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:48001:189"/>
for the going on in his Design: Which had
it been, he might have given us such a
body of <hi>Natural Philosophy,</hi> and made it so

devest themselves of many vain Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and overcome a thousand false
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:48001:189"/>
Images, which lie like Monsters in their
way, before they can get as far this. And
of these, I shall only mention one Great
Man, who had the true Imagination of
the whole extent of this <hi>Enterprize,</hi> as
it is now set on foot; and that is, the
Lord <hi>Bacon.</hi> In whose Books there are,
every where scattered, the best Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that can be produc'd for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of <hi>Experimental Philosophy;</hi> and
the best directions that are needful to
promote it. All which he has, already
adorn'd with so much Art; that if my
desires could have prevail'd with some
excellent Friends of mine, who engag'd
me to this Work, there should have been
no other Preface to the <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>Royal
Society,</hi> but some of <hi>his Writings.</hi> But,
methinks, in this one Man, I do at once
find enough occasion, to admire the
strength of Humane Wit, and to bewail
the weakness of a Mortal Condition. For,
is it not Wonderful, that he, who had
run through all the degrees of that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi>
which usually takes up Mens whole
time; who had Studied, and Practised,
and Governed the <hi>Common Law:</hi> Who
had always liv'd in the Crowd, and born
the greatest burden of Civil Business;
Should yet find leisure enough for these
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:48001:190"/>
retird Studies, to excel all those Men,
who separate themselves for this very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose?
He was a Man of strong, clear,
and powerful Imaginations: His <hi>Genius</hi>
was searching, and inimitable: And of
this I need give no other Proof, than his
Style it self; which as, for the most part,
it describes Men's minds, as well as Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
do their Bodies: So it did <hi>His,</hi>
above all Men living. The <hi>Course</hi> of it
Vigorous, and Majestical: The <hi>Wit</hi> bold
and familiar: The <hi>Comparisons</hi> fetch'd out
of the way, and yet the most easie: In
all, expressing a Soul equally skill'd in
<hi>Men,</hi> and <hi>Nature.</hi>
                     </q> All this, and much
more, is true of him: But yet his <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical</hi>
Works do shew, that a single and
busie Hand, can never grasp all this whole
Design, of which we treat. His <hi>Rules</hi>
were admirable: Yet his <hi>History</hi> not so
faithful as might have been wish'd in many
places: He seems rather to <hi>take all that comes,</hi>
than to choose; and to <hi>heap</hi> rather than
to <hi>register.</hi> But I hope this Accusation of
mine, can be no great injury to his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
seeing, at the same time, that I say he
had not the strength of <hi>a thousand Men,</hi> I
do also allow him to have had as much as
<hi>Twenty.</hi>
