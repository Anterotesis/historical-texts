            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

You see what <hi>palpebrae</hi> are. I could giue you
strange examples, perhapps not proper to this daie
more then others, yet neither impertinent to my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
nor vnacceptable to a loiall auditorie, nor stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers

aliene from the worke we haue in hand, our greate

For doe we blesse God for preseruing the life

<hi>discrimen</hi> and narrow exigent of life, which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
was put vnto, when he was in the fanges of the

so much afflict him, as an vndeserued crime &amp; impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

the fifth of August last, that the <hi>Gowries</hi> conspired

it. But what hath the Lord done the meanetime? Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
<hi>oculus non respexit,</hi> his eie did not open out of
hand, and giue them present satisfaction, yet <hi>palpebrae
explorarunt, his eieliddes considered,</hi> he thought vpon
it in secret, in the counsaile of his owne heart, and by
a posthumous, penitent tonfession (after the conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:8493:21"/>
were most of them dead, and almost rotten) of
one of the complices themselues, laid it as it were
in the sunne-beames, and put it past al question. It
were strange to giue you a parallele to this, coeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
I thinke in time, and of the same standing. It
was eight yeares since likewise, in the daies of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
the eighth, that Letters were sent vnto Rome,
to the Pope and two Cardinals, <hi>Aldobrandine</hi>
and <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> wherein the hande of the King was
abused, his heart neuer coulde. (I doe but touch
by the way: I am <hi>vox clamantis,</hi> the voice to a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
crier and lowde trumpetter of these thinges)
The matter hath long slept, yeares after yeares haue
expired, and Pope deceased after Pope. But <hi>pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pebrae
eius explorârunt,</hi> though the eie of the Lorde
hath not seemed to stirre al this while, his <hi>Eie-liddes</hi>
haue considered, and bethought of the meanes and
opportunitie to bring all forth. And now at length,
truth the daughter of time, or rather of the euerli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God, though not by that miracle in the Psalme
<hi>Ex ore infantium,</hi> yet by an other not inferiour,
<hi>Ex ore malignantium,</hi> out of the mouthes and hearts
of enimies, which intended a scandall to his sacred
person, hath as strangely discouered this as that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to the glorie of his great name, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
both of king and kingdome. Both these haue
the eie-liddes of the Lorde considered and revealed
the one after eight yeares, and the other after eight;
the one by an actor or accessarie to the fact, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the actour; the one by occasion of papers
and skrolles, the other by occasion of papers and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:8493:21"/>
pamphlets. And now to the seruice of this happie
day, wherein wee sing our <hi>Hosanna,</hi> and commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
our great and general <hi>iubilee,</hi> Let this bee added
as not the least part of our Christian ioie, that his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Maiestie, so farre is it from him, with other
kings of the earth to receaue the marke of the beast
imprinted in his forehead, that he is iealous, impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
cannot endure that any scratch of a pen, or type
of a Printers Presse should leaue the least note or sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
vpon him, as if euer he had but a thought in
his heart to fal downe and worship that golden calfe.
I returne where I left. <hi>The Lord is in his holy pallace,
&amp;c.</hi> There he sitteth, and seeth, and considereth both
with eie and eieliddes,<note place="margin">Psal. 58.</note> and in the ende shall iudge.
<hi>Laetabitur iustus cum viderit vindictam.</hi> If the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
shal reioice to beholde, much more to escape
vengance. If when he washeth his feet in the bloud
of the wicked, much more that the wicked wash not
their feete in the bloud of Saints. <hi>Factum est istud à
domino:</hi> this was the Lords doing alone. He shut the
mouth of that pestilent quiver that not an arrow was
shot against vs to hurt one haire of our heades; and
stood as a wall of fire about vs, 2. <hi>Zach.</hi> to keepe vs
from that merciles <hi>Tophet</hi> of fire, even ready to haue
devoured vs. And therefore, <hi>non nobis domine, non
nobis, not vnto vs, O Lord, not vnto vs,</hi> but vnto thine
<hi>all-onely name,</hi> not the names of our king nor princes,
our Sages nor Senators (the greatest names amongst

it, <hi>da gloriam,</hi> giue thou the honour and glory of that

and Commons, high and low, one with an other, old
men and maidens, young men and sucklings, praise
the name of the Lord, sing praises, sing praises vnto
him whilest you haue any being. It is the cause of our
meetings and panegyrickes this day, and it shalbee
<hi>a Law in Israell and an ordinaunce in Iacob</hi> amongst
our childrens children to the last day. <hi>Sit nomen do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini
