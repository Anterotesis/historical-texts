            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Natures have ever both amongst
the Ancients and Modernes in the
best times, presented spectacles,
and personall representations, to
recreate their Spirits wasted in
grave affaires of State, and for the
entertainment of their Nobilitie, Ladies, and Courts.</p>
            <p>There being now past three yeers of Intermission,
that the King and Queenes Majesties have not made
Masques with shewes and Intermdij, by reason the
roome where formerly they were presented, having
the seeling since richly adorn'd with peeces of painting
of great value, figuring the acts of King <hi>Iames</hi> of
happy memory, and other inrichments: lest this
might suffer by the smoake of many lights, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
commanded the Surveyor of his workes, that a
new temporary roome of Timber, both for strength
and capacitie of spectators, should bee suddenly built
for that use; which being performed in two moneths,
the Scenes for this Masque were prepared.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>BRitanocles,</hi> the glory of the Westerne world,
hath by his wisedome, valour, and pietie,
not onely vindicated his owne, but farre distant
Seas, infested with Pyrats, and reduc'd the land
(by his example) to a reall knowledge of all good
Arts and Sciences. These eminent Acts <hi>Bellero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi>
in a wise pittie willingly would preserve
from devouring time, and therefore to make them
last to our Posteritie, gives a command to Fame,
(who hath already spred them abroad) that shee
should now at home (if there can bee any malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
insensible) awake them from their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
sleepe, that even they with the large yet still
increasing number of the good and loyall, may
mutually admire and rejoyce in our happinesse.</p>
               <p>THe Queens Majestie being seated under the State,
and the roome fild with Spectators of qualitie, at
the lower end of the roome was a Stage raised of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
height, and an Ovall staire downe into the
roome: That which first presented it selfe to the eye,
was the Ornament that enclosed the Scene.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:8287:3"/>
In the under part of this were two pedestalls of a
solid order whereon captives lay bound, above sate two
figures in neeches; on the right hand a woman in a
watchet drapery, heightned with silver, on her head a
<hi>Corona Rostrata,</hi> with one hand holding the rudder of a
ship, &amp; in the other a little winged figure with a branch
of Palme, and a Girland; this woman represented
Navall victory. Opposite to this in the other neech sate
the figure of a man bearing a Scepter with a hand and
an eye in the Palme, and in the other hand a booke,
on his head a Girland of <hi>Amaranthus,</hi> his Curace was
of gold, with a <hi>Palludamentum</hi> of blue and Antike ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Crimson, his foot treading on the head of a
Serpent; by this figure was signified right govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
above these were other composed ornaments
cut out like cloth of silver, tied up in knots with scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fings
all touch'd with gold.</p>
               <p>These Pillasters bore up a large Freese with a Sea
triumph of naked children, riding on sea horses &amp; fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
and young Tritons with writhen trumpets, and other
maritime fancies. In the midst was placed a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiment
of gold, with branches of Palme comming
out of the scrowles, and within that a lesser of silver
with this inscription, <hi>VIRTVTIS OPVS,</hi> proper to
the subject of this Masque, and alluding to that of
<hi>Virgil—Sed famam extendere factis, &amp;c.</hi> from this
came a drapery of Crimson, which tied up with great
knots in the corners hung downe in foulds on the sides
of the Pillasters.</p>
               <p>A curtaine flying up discovered the first Scene,
wherein were English houses of the old and newer
formes, intermixt with trees, and a farre off a prospect
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8287:4"/>
of the Citie of London, and the River of Thames,
which being a principall part, might bee taken for all
great Britaine.</p>
               <p>From severall parts of the Scene came <hi>Action</hi> and
<hi>Imposture. Action</hi> a young man in a rich habit downe to
his knees, with a large gard of purple about the skirt,
wherein was written with silver letters, <hi>MEDIO
TVTISSIMA,</hi> on his head a girland of Laurell, and
in one hand a branch of willow: <hi>Imposture</hi> in a coar
with hanging sleeves and great skirts, little breeches,
a high crownd hat one side pind up, a little ruffe, and
a formall beard, and an angling rod in his hand with a
fish at the hooke, with a bag and a horne at his girdle.</p>

running farre in: the Pillasters were silver of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke
worke, their bases and capitels of gold, in the

doores leaves with figures of Basse-relieve, with Jambs
and frontispice all of gold, above these ran an Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traue
Freese and Coronis of the same; the Freese
enricht with Jewels; this bore up a Ballestrata, in the

stood Fame in a Carnation garment, trimd
with gold, with white wings and flaxen haire, In one

Arms with a Curace and plumed Helme, and
a broken Lance in his hand.</p>
               <p>On the left hand, a woman in a watchet robe trim'd
with silver, on her head a Bend, with little wings like

seeming of white marble, the Basesxs and Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
of gold; this joyning with the former having so
many returnes, openings, and windowes, might well
be knowne for the glorious Palace of Fame.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Chorus</hi> of Poets entred in rich habits of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall

               <p>The habit of the Masquers was close bodies of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
embroydered with silver, their arming sleeves
of the same; about their waste two rowes of severall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioned
leaves, and under this their bases of white, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
to the middle of their thigh, on this was an under
basis with labels of Carnation embroidered with silver,
and betwixt every paine were pufts of silver fastned in
knots to the labels, the trimming of the shoulders
was as that of the Basis, their long stockins set up were
Carnation with white shooes, and roses, their bands
and cuffes made of purles of Cutworke, upon their
heads little carnation caps embroydered as the rest,
with a slit turned up before, out of the midst came

severall falls of white feathers diminishing upwards in
