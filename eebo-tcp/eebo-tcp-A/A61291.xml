            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E are entring upon a Subject which I confesse,
is in it self harsh, and exotick, very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
for our Tongue; yet I doubt not but
they will pardon this, who shall consider,
that other Philosophies and Sciences have
been lately well received by several Nations translated into
their own Languages; and that this, as being the first,
contributes not a little to the understanding of the rest.</p>
                  <p>Another disadvantage this Subject incurres far more
considerable: There is not any thing more difficult to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd
out of the Ruins of Antiquity than the Learning of
the Eastern Nations, and particularly that of the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeans.</hi>
What remains of it is chiefly transmitted to us by
the <hi>Greeks,</hi> of whom, some converted it to their own use, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixing
it with their Philosophy, as <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;</hi>
others treated expressely of it, but their Writings are
lost. Of its first Authors nothing remains; what others
took from it, is not distinguishable from their proper Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy.
The <hi>Greeks</hi> were first made acquainted with it
by <hi>Osthanes,</hi> and, long after, by <hi>Berosus,</hi> the former living
in the time of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> the other, under <hi>Ptolomaeus Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphus.</hi>
Whence it may be inferr'd, that the <hi>Discourse,</hi>
which <hi>Democritus</hi> writ of <hi>Chaldaea,</hi> and his <hi>Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
of the <hi>Sacred Letters at Babylon,</hi> either came short of
these Sciences, or were so obscure, that they conduced little to
their discovery. Neither seems the Treatise, entituled <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi>
ascribed, by some, to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> by others, to <hi>Rhodon,</hi>
but indeed written by <hi>Antisthenes,</hi> to have considered the
Learning and Sciences, so much as the History of the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors.
Of which kind were also the Writers concerning the
<hi>Magi,</hi> cited, under that general Title, by <hi>Diogenes La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:49660:4"/>
But there wanted not those, who further explain'd to the
<hi>Greeks</hi> what <hi>Osthanes</hi> and <hi>Berosus</hi> had first communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<hi>Hermippus</hi> (to use <hi>Pliny</hi>'s words) wrote most dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
of <hi>Magick,</hi> and Commented upon the Verses of <hi>Zoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aster.</hi>
About the time of <hi>Antonius Pius</hi> flourished the two
<hi>Julians,</hi> father &amp; son, Chaldaick Philosophers: the first wrote
<hi>concerning the Chaldaick Rites,</hi> the later, <hi>Theurgick Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
in Verse, and other secrets of that Science.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
wrote <hi>Symbulus</hi> and <hi>Pallas, concerning the Magi;</hi>
and the later <hi>Platonick</hi> Philosophers more frequently:
<hi>Amelius,</hi> 40 Books, of confutation; <hi>Porphyrius,</hi> 4. on
the <hi>History of Julian the Chaldaean; Jamblichus,</hi> 28.
intituled, <hi>Of the most perfect Chaldaick Theology;</hi>
and <hi>Syrianus,</hi> 10. upon the Oracles.</p>
                  <p>Of all these, there is nothing extant, unlesse (which we
shall have occasion hereafter to prove) the few <hi>Oracles,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spers'd
among the <hi>Platonick</hi> Writers, be part of those,
which were, by the <hi>Greeks, (Hermippus, Julian</hi> the son,
and others) translated out of the <hi>Chaldaick,</hi> Some of these
<hi>Pletho</hi> and <hi>Psellus</hi> have explain'd with a Comment, adding
two brief obscure Summaries of the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> Doctrine,
which we have endeavoured to supply and clear, by adding
and digesting the few remains of those Sciences which ly
dispers'd amongst other Authors; taking care to reject such
as are supposititious, or of no credit, as, in the Historical
part, <hi>Annius Viterbiensis, Clemens Romanus,</hi> and the
like: in the Philosophical, the <hi>Rabbinical Inventions,</hi>
which (though incuriously admitted by <hi>Kircher, Gaulmin,</hi>
and others) manifestly appear to have been of later inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

into <hi>Greece. Troy,</hi> according to the <hi>Marmor Arundelianum</hi> was
taken 434. years before the first Olympiad. <hi>Xerxes's</hi> expedition was
on the first of the 75. Olympiad, <hi>viz.</hi> the of the Julian Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod.
The accompt of <hi>Suidas</hi> therefore falls on the 3030. that of
<hi>Xanthus</hi> on the 3634. of the Julian Period. The latest of these

the Chaldeans, Philosophy is deliver'd by Tradition in the family, the Son
receiving it from the Father, being exempted from all other employment;
and thus having their Parents for their Teachers, they learn all things
fully and abundantly, believing more firmly what is communicated to
them: and being brought up in these Disciplines from Children, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a great habit in Astrology, as well because that age is apt to Learn,
as for that they imploy so much time in Study. But among the Greeks,

this Profession erect new Sects, and contradicting one another in the most
considerable Theorems, make their Disciples dubious; and their minds, as
long as they live, are in suspense and doubt, neither can they firmly believe
any thing: for if a man examine the chiefest Sects of the Philosophers,
he will find them most different from one another, and directly opposite in

                              <p>The <hi>third</hi> is of Intellectuals; which only understand: as being
Intellect, either essentially or by participation. By which distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
we may conceive that the highest Order is above Intellect,
being understood by the middle sort of Minds. The middle Order
participates of the Superiour, but consists of Minds which understand
both the superiour and themselves also. The last Order seems to be
of Minds, whose office is to understand not only themselves but su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours
and inferiours also.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Of the first of which Orders, the</hi> Anonymus <hi>Author of the Summary
of the Chaldaick Doctrine, thus:</hi> Then <hi>(viz. next the one &amp; good)</hi> they

hath a Father, a Power, and a Mind: Psellus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                                 <hi>somewhat more fully;</hi>
Next the One they assert the paternal Depth compleated by three Triads:
each of the Triads having a Father first, then a Power middle, and a
Mind the third amongst them: which <hi>(Mind)</hi> shutteth up the Triad with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
itself, these they call also Intelligibles.</p>
                              <p>This Triple Triad seems to be the same with the Triad mention'd
in the Oracles of <hi>Zoroaster.</hi> What <hi>Psellus</hi> terms <hi>Father,</hi> he calls
<hi>Father</hi> also.
<q>The Father perfected all things, <hi>and</hi> Paternal Monad
Where the Paternal Monad is.—</q>
                                 <hi>The second which</hi> Psellus <hi>calls</hi> Power, <hi>he terms also</hi> the power of
the Father.
<q>Neither did he shut up his own fire in his Intellectual power.
<hi>and</hi>—The strength of the Father</q>
And the <hi>Duad</hi> generated by the Monad and resident with him:
<q>The Monad is enlarged which generates two.</q>
And again,
<q>The Duad resides with him.</q>
This is also <hi>the first paternal Mind;</hi> for the third of this Triad, which
<hi>Psellus</hi> terms the Mind, he saith is the second Mind.
<q>
                                    <l>The Father perfected all things, and delivered them over</l>
                                    <l>To the second Mind, which all Man-kind calls the first.</l>
                                 </q>
And as <hi>Psellus</hi> saith, that this Mind shuts up the Triad and paternal
Depth within it self; so <hi>Zoroaster</hi>
                                 <q>It is the Bound of the paternal Depth and Fountain of Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuals.</q>

Of the Animal-productive Principles, <hi>(continues the Anonymus)</hi>
the top is called Hecate, the middle principiative Soul, the bottom princia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

(<hi>as</hi> Psellus <hi>saith)</hi> esteem Hecate a Goddesse, seated in the middle
rank, and possessing as it were the Center of all the Powers; in her right
parts they place the fountain of Souls, in her left the fountain of goods or
of Virtues; Moreover they say, the fountain of Souls is prompt to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
but the fountain of Virtues continueth within the bounds of its
own Essence, and is as a Virgin incorrupted; which setlednesse and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mobility,
it receives from the power of the Amilicti, and is guirt with a
Virgin Zone. What <hi>Psellus</hi> here calls the fountain of Souls, and the
fountain of Virtues, is the same which the Anonymus styles, principiative
Soul, and principiative Virtue.</p>

Neither can it seem strange that the three last only should be
called Material: for the Chaldaeans conceiving matter to be a dark
substance or rather Darkness it self, the Empyreal and Aetherial
Worlds, which (as we shall shew) consist only of Light or Fire,
cannot in their sense be said to be Material, though Corporeal.</p>

down, and enemies of Mankind.</hi> Of the First we have treated alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
of the Latter <hi>Psellus,</hi> in his discourse upon this subject, gives a
large accompt from one <hi>Marcus</hi> of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> who having been
of this Religion, and well acquainted with their Institutions, was
afterwards converted to Christianity: what he relates, as well from
the Doctrine it self, as from the place, sufficiently appears to be
of the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> Tradition. It is to this effect.</p>
                              <p>These Daemons are of many kinds, and various sorts, both as to
their Figures and Bodies, insomuch that the Air is full of them, as
well that which is above us, as that which is round about us. The
Earth likewise is full, and the Sea, and the most retired cavities
and depths.</p>
                              <p>There are six general kinds of these Daemons. The first named
<hi>Leliurius,</hi> which signifies Fiery. This kind dwelleth in the Air that
is above us: for from the places next about the Moon, as being
Sacred, all kinds of Daemons, as being prophane, are expelled. The
second kind is that which wandreth in the Air contiguous to us, and
is by many peculiarly called Aërial. The third, Terrestial. The
fourth, Watery and Marine. The fifth, Subteraneous. The sixt Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifugous,
and hardly sensible.</p>
                              <p>All these kind of Daemors are haters of God, and enemies of

that he who speaks, being a far off, is forced to use a greater
sound, being neer, he speakes softly into the ear of the Hearer, and if
he could get into the spirit of the Soul, he would not need any sound,
but what discourse soever he pleaseth, would, by a way without
sound, arrive there where it is to be received, which they say is
likewise in Souls, when they are out of the body, for they discourse
with one another without noise. After this manner the Daemons
converse with us, privately, so as we are not sensible which way
the war comes upon us.</p>
                              <p>Neither can this be doubted, if we observe what happens to the
Air. For, when the Sun shineth it assumeth several colours and
forms, transmitting them to other things, as we may see in Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glasses.
In like manner the Daemons, assuming figures and
colours, and whatsoever forms they please, transmit them into our
animal Spirit, and by that meanes afford us much businesse, suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
counsels, representing figures, resuscitating the remembrance
of pleasures, exciting the images of passions, as well when we sleep
as when we wake, and sometimes, titillating the genital parts,
inflame us with frantick and unlawful desires, especially if they
take, co-operating with them the hot humidities which are in us.</p>
                              <p>The rest of the Daemons know nothing that is subtile, nor how
to breed disturbance, yet are they hurtfull and abominable, hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the same manner as the spirit or vapour in <hi>Charon</hi>'s Cave:
For as that is reported to kill whatsoever approacheth it, whether
Beast, Man, or Bird; in like manner these Daemons destroy those
upon whom they chance to fall, overthrowing their Souls and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and their natural habits, and sometimes by fire, or water, or
precipice, they destroy not men only, but some irrational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>

wishing them ill, but out of the love they have of their Animal heat:
For dwelling in the most remote cavities, which are extremely cold
and dry, they contract much coldnesse, wherewith being afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they affect the humid and animal heat, and, to enjoy it, they
insinuate themselves into Irrational creatures, and go into Baths
and Pits; for they hate the heat of Fire and of the Sun, because it
burns and dryeth up.</p>
                              <p>But they most delight in the heat of Animals, as being temperate,
and mixt with moisture, especially that of men, being best tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
into which insinuating themselves, they cause infinite distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,
stopping up the pores in which the Animal spirit is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
and streightning and compressing the spirit, by reason of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49660:20"/>
grossnesse of the bodies with which they are indued. Whence it
happeneth, that the bodies are disordered, and their principal
faculties distemper'd, and their motions become dull and heavy.</p>
                              <p>Now if the insinuating Daemon be one of the Subterraneous
kind, he distorteth the possessed Person, and speaketh by him,
making use of the Spirit of the patient, as if it were his own Organ.
But if any of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a Man, he causeth relaxation of the limbs, and stoppeth the voice,
and maketh the possessed Person in all respects like one that is dead.
For this being the last kind of Daemons is more Earthly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
cold and dry, and into whomsoever it insinuates, it hebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
and makes dull all the faculties of his Soul.</p>

and for that reason most persons aptly call it Dumb and Deaf,
nor can they who are possessed withit by any other meanes be
freed from it, but by the Divine favour obtained by Fasting and
Prayer.</p>
                              <p>That Physicians endeavour to perswade us, that these Passions
proceed not from Daemons, but from Humours, and Spirits ill affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and therefore go about to cure them, not by Incantations and
Expiations, but by Medicines and Diet, is nothing strange, since
they know nothing beyond Sense, and are wholly addicted to study
the Body. And perhaps not without reason are some things ascribed
to ill-affected Humours, as Lethargies, Melancholies, Frenzies,
which they take away and cure, either by evacuating the Humours,
or by replenishing the Body if it be Empty, or by outward applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
But as for Enthusiasms, ragings, and unclean Spirits, with
which whosoever is possessed is not able to act any thing, neither by
Intellect, Speech, Phantasie nor Sense; or else there is some other thing
that moves them unknown to the Person possessed, which sometimes
foretelleth Future events; How can we call th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

such affections are only proper to Compounds: but the Bodies of
Daemons are simple, and being very ductile and flexible are ready
to take any Figure. As we see the Clouds represent sometimes
Men, somtimes Bears, sometimes Dragons, or any other F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>gures:
so is it with the Daemoniack Bodies. Now the Clouds appear in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Figures according as they are driven by exteriour blasts or
winds: but in Daemons, who can passe as they please into any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes,
and sometimes contract, sometimes extend themselves like
wormes on the Earth, being of a soft and tractable Nature, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Bulk is changed, but the Figure and Colour, and that several
wayes; for the Daemoniack body being by Nature capable of all
these, as it is apt to recede, it is changed into several forms; as it is
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49660:21"/>
Aërial, it is susceptible of all sorts of Colours, like Air, but the Air
is coloured by something extrinsecal.</p>
                              <p>The Daemoniack Body, from it's intrinsecal Phantastick Power
and energy, produceth the forms of colours in it self, as we some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
look Pale, sometimes Red, according as the Soul is affected
either with Fear or Anger. The like we must imagine of Daemons:
for from within they send forth several kinds of colours into their
Bodies. Thus the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>r Bodies being changed into what Figure, and
assuming what Colour they please, they sometimes appear in the
shape of a Man, sometimes of a Woman, of a Lion, of a Leopard,
of a wild Boar, sometimes in the figure of a Bottle, and sometimes,
like a little Dog fawning upon us.</p>
                              <p>Into all these forms they change themselves, but keep none of
them constantly: for the figure is not solid, but immediately is
dissipated; as when we pour somthing coloured into Water, or
draw a figure in the Air. In like manner is it with Daemons, their
Colour, Figure, and Form presently vanish.</p>
                              <p>But all Daemons have not the same power and will, there is much
inequality amongst them as to these. Some there are Irrational, as
amongst Compound Animals; for as, of them, Man, participating of
Intellect and Reason, hath also a larger Phantasie, extending also to

but Horses, Oxen, and the like, have a narrower and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Phantasie, yet such as extends to the knowledg of the Creatures
that feed with them, their Mangers, and their Masters; lastly,
Flies, Gnats, and Worms have it extremely contracted, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherent;
for they know neither the hole out of which they came,
nor whither they go, nor whither they ought to go, they have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one Phantasie which is that of aliment. In like manner there are
different k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

these have a various Phantasie, which is capable of extending to
any thing maginable. The Subterraneous and Lucifugous are not
of this Nature; whence it comes to passe, that they make not use
of many Figures, as neither having variety of Phantasms, nor a
Body apt for action and transformation. But the watery and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restial,
being of middle kind between these, are capable of taking ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
forms, but keep themselves constantly to that in which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.
They which live in humid places, transform themselves
into the shapes of Birds and Women; whence termed by the
Greeks <hi>Naiades</hi> and <hi>Nereides</hi> and <hi>Dryades</hi> in the Feminine gender.
But such as are conversant in dry places have also dry Bodies, such
as the <hi>Onosceles</hi> are said to be. These transform themselves into
Men, sometimes into Dogs, Lions, and the like Animals, which
are of a Masculine d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>The Bodies of Daemons are capable of being struck, and are
pained thereby, though they are not compounds, for Sense is not
only proper to compounds. That thing in Man which feeleth, is

neither the Bone nor the Nerve, but the Spirit which is in them.

be sensible of pain, but in as much as it partaketh of Spirit, and
therefore being broken into pieces, or dead, it is absolutely insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
because it hath no Spirit. In like manner a Daemon being all
Spirit; is of his own nature sensible in every part; he immediately
seeth, and heareth, he is obnoxious to suffering by touch; being

within their proper circumscriptions, but only together with their obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the seven Planets, it came at length into their minds to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the whole Circle into twelve parts: The manner they relate thus;
they say that the Antients having observed some one bright Star of those in
Zodiack, filled a vessel (in which they bored a hole) with water, and
let the water run into another vessel placed underneath, so long untill the
same Star rose again; collecting that from the same Signe to the same,
was the whole revolution of the Circle; Then they took the twelfth part
of the water which had run out, and considered how long it was in runn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
affirming that the twelfth part of the Circle past over in the same
space of time; and that it had that proportion to the whole Circle which
the part of water had to the whole water: By this Analogy (I mean of the
Dodecatemorion or twlelfth part) they marked out the extreme term
from some Signal Star which then appeared, or from some that arose
within that time, Northern or Southern; the same course they took in the
rest of the Dodecatemoria.</p>

Aspect, or not at all; for most of the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> have absolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
that the Signs which are next to one another behold one
another; But when he is in the third Sign, that is, when
there is a Sign betwixt them, then he is said to behold the first
place whence he came, but with a very oblique &amp; weak light, which
Aspect is termed Sextile; for it subtends the sixth part of a Circle:
for if we draw lines from the first Sign to the third, from the third
to the fifth, and from thence to the seventh, &amp; so on, we shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
an aequilateral Hexagone; This Aspect they did not wholly of,
for that it seemed to conduce the least to the Nativity of the Child,
but when he comes to the fourth Sign, so that there are two betwixt,
he looks on it with a Quarterly Aspect: for that line which his Aspect
makes, cuts off a fourth part of the Circle. When he is in the fifth
there being three betwixt, it is a Trine Aspect, for it subtends a third
part of the Zodaick: which two Aspects the Quartile and Trine being
very efficacious afford much increase to the Birth. But the Aspect from
the sixth place is wholly inefficacious, for the line there makes not a side of
any Polygone, but from the <hi>7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

those which are predominant in every Nativity, and chiefly
to be considered in Prognosticks, are four, which by one common Name
they term Centers <hi>(or Angles,)</hi> but more particularly, they call one
the Horoscope, <hi>or Ascendant,</hi> another the Medium Caeli, <hi>(the

the Subterrestrial and opposite to the <hi>Medium Caeli, (the

if <hi>Cancer</hi> be the Horoscope, <hi>Aries</hi> is the <hi>Medium Coeli, Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn</hi>
Descendant, and <hi>Libra</hi> Subterrestrial. That House which goes
before either of these Houses they call cadent, that which followeth,
succedent; now that which goes before the Horoscope being apparent
to us, they affirm to be of the ill <hi>Genius,</hi> that next which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the <hi>Medium Coeli</hi> of the good <hi>Genius,</hi> that which is before
the <hi>Medium Coeli,</hi> the inferior Portion and single Lot, and God:

of Death; that which is after the Ascendant, and is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
to us, the Fury and ill Fortune; that which cometh under
the Earth good Fortune, opposite to the good <hi>Genius:</hi> that which
is beyond the <hi>Imum Coeli</hi> towards the East, Goddesse; that which
followeth the Horoscope slothful, which also is opposite to the slothful.</p>
                              <p>Or more briefly thus:<note place="margin">Sex. loc. cit.</note> The Cadent of the Horoscope is called the
ill <hi>Genius,</hi> the Succedent slothful, the Cadent of the <hi>Medium

Coeli,</hi> Goddesse, the Succedent good Fortune, the Cadent of the

Upon these Grounds the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> made their <hi>Apotolesmatick</hi>
Praedictions,<note place="margin">Sext. loc. cit.</note> of which there is a difference; for some of them are
more simple, others more accurate: the more simple, those which are
made from any one Sign, or the simple force of a single Star, as
that a Star being in such a Sign shall cause such kind of Men: the
more accurate, those which are made by the Concourse, and as they
say, the Contemporation of many. As if one Sar be in the Horos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope,

The First is of those which deal in Plants, Animals, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.
The Second consists in Circumscription and Determination
of some time, in which the Operations are to be performed. The
Third consists in Human Gestures and Actions; as in Clapping the
Hands, Leaping, Crying aloud, Laughing, Lying Prostrate on the
Earth, Burning of any thing, Kindling of Smoak, and Lastly in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
certain words Intelligible or Unintelligible; these are the
kinds of their Magical Operations.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <note n="b" place="margin">loc. cit.</note> Some there are which are not performed but by all these Kinds: As
when they say, take such a Leaf of such an Herb when the Moon is in
such a Degree and Place: Or, take of the Horn of such a Beast, or of
his Hair, Sweat or Blood, such a quantity, when the Sun is in the
middle of Heaven, or in some other certain Place. Or, take of
such a Metall, or of many Metalls, melt them under such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation,
and in such a Position of the Moon; then pronounce such
and such words; make a suffumigation of such and such leaves, in such and
such a figure, and this or that thing shall come to passe.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <note n="c" place="margin">loc. cit.</note> Other Magical operations there are which they conceive may be
performed by one of the fore-mentioned kinds, only these (say they) are
performed for the most part by Women, as we find amongst them: for
the bringing forth of Waters, if ten Virgins shall adorn themselves
and put on red Garments, and leap in such manner that one shall
thrust on the other, and this to be done going backwards and forwards,
and afterwards shall stretch out their fingers towards the Sun, make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
certain Signes, this action being finished, they say that waters
will issue forth. In like manner they write, that if fower Women
&amp;c. using certain words and certain gestures, by this action they
shall divert hail from falling down. Many other such like vanities
they mention all along their writings, which are to be performed by
Women.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <note n="d" place="margin">Maim. Mor. Ne.</note> But none of these (as they imagine) can be performed without
having respect and consideration <hi>of the Stars; for thy conceive that
every Plant</hi> hath it's proper Star: they ascribe also certain Stars to
all living Creatures and Metalls; Moreover these operations are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
worships of the Stars, and that they are delighted with such
an action, or speech, or Suffumigation, and for it's sake afford them what
they wish. <hi>Hitherto</hi> R. Maimonides, <hi>who only hath preserved these

Silver to the Moon, and so distributed the Metalls and Climates of
the Earth among the Stars, for they said, that such a Star is the God of
such a Climate. There they built Temples, and placed the Images
in them, conceiving that the Power of the Stars did flow into those
Images, and that those Images had the faculty of understanding, and
did give to Men the gift of Prophecy, and in a word did declare to
them what things were good for them. So also they say of Trees which
belong to those Stars, every Tree being dedicated to some Star, and
planted to it's Name, and worshipped, for this or that reason, because
the Spiritual Vertues of the Stars, are infused into that Tree, so that

that they were statues made in the figure of men under certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellations,

that if any had a Mind to know any secret concerning his Wife, he was
to have recourse to the Image of the Dove which answered his Demands;
if concerning his Children, he went to the Boys; if concerning Riches,
to the Eagle; if concerning Power and Strength, to the Lion; if it anything
concerned Sons and Daughters, he went then to the Calves; and if about
the length of Years and Dayes, he was to consult the Image of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon.

<hi>opinion thus:</hi> The Gods give those things that are truly good, to such
as are purified by sacrifices; with whom also they converse, and by their
communication drive away wickedness and passion far from them; and by
their brightness chace from thence the dark Spirit; for the evill Spirits,
when the light of the Gods cometh in, fly away as shadows at the light of
the Sun: neither are they able any longer to disturb the pious sacrificer,
who is free from all wickedness, perversness, and passion: but such as are
pernicious, and behave themselves insolently in opposition to sacred Rites
and Orders, these by reason of the imbecillity of their action, and want of
power, are not able to attain to the Gods, but because of certain pollutions
are driven away from the Gods, and associated with ill Daemons, by whose
bad breath they are inspired, and depart thence most wicked, profane and
dissolute; unlike the Gods in desire, but in all things resembling the bad
Daemons with whom they converse daily. There men therefore being full
of passion and wickedness, by the affinity that is betwixt them, draw the
evil Spirits to them, by whom being quickly possest, they are again excited
to all iniquity, one assisting and strengthning the other, like a Circle
whose beginning and end meet.</p>

                              <p>The Daemons <hi>(saith</hi> Psellus) that are neer the Earth are by Nature
lying, as being far off from the Divine Knowledge, and filled with dark
matter. Now if you would have any true discourse from these prepare an
Altar and Sacrifize the Stone Mnizuris. This Stone hath the power of
evocations, the other greater Daemon who invisibly approacheth to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Daemon will pronounce the true relation of demands, which
transmits to the demandant the Oracle the vocatine name with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing

                              <p>Another of these Rites mentioned by the same Oracles, is

                              <p>The <hi>Hecatine Strophalus (saith</hi> Psellus) is a golden ball, in the

over with Characters; Thus whipping it about they made their Invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
These they use to call Iynges whether it be round or triangle or any
other Figure, and whilst they are doing thus they make insignificant or
brutish cries, and lash the Air with their whips. The Oracle adviseth to
the performance of these Rites, or such a Motion of the <hi>Strophalus,</hi> as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an expressible power. It is called <hi>Hecatine</hi> as being dedicated to
<hi>Hecate. Hecate</hi> is a Goddesse amongst the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> having at her

                              <p>No little Efficacy was attributed to certain words used in these
Rites, which the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> Oracles expresly forbid to be changed.</p>

If a Man threaten to send them thither, and pronounce the names of

property of Compounds, but of Spirits; That thing in a Man which feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
is neither the Bone, nor the Nerve, but the Spirit which is in
them: whence if the Nerve be press'd or seized with cold or the like,
there ariseth pain from the Emission of one Spirit into another Spirit;
for it is impossible that a compound Body should in it self be sensible of
pain, but in as much as it partaketh of Spirit, and therfore being cut
into pieces, or dead, it is absolutely insensible; because it hath no

Bodies; only herein differing from them, that other things being cut
assunder can by no meanes or very hardly be made whole again, whereas
the Daemon immediately commeth together again, as Air or Water parted
by some more solid Body. But though this Spirit joyns again in a moment,
neverthelesse at the very time in which the dissection is made it is pained;
for this reason they are much affraid of swords, which they who chase them
away knowing, stick up pointed Irons or swords in those places where

God, though after an Idolatrous manner: The Author of
the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> Summary affirms, that <hi>they held one principle of all
things, and declare that it is one and good.</hi> That by this <hi>one</hi> and <hi>good</hi>
they meant the true God, (to whom alone those attributes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long)
may be gathered from<note n="a" place="margin">Praepar. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vang.</note>
                                 <hi>Eusebius,</hi> who saith, (speaking
doubtless of the Followers of <hi>Zoroaster)</hi> that <hi>in the first place they
conceive God the Father and King ought to be ranked;</hi> for this reason
the <hi>Delphian</hi> Oracle attested by <hi>Porphyrius,</hi> joyns them with the
Hebrews;
<q>
                                    <l>Chaldees and Iews wise onely, worshipping</l>
                                    <l>Purely a self-begotten God and King.</l>

but (notwithstanding the Oracle) that this Worship, though
of the True God, was Idolatrous, is beyond doubt: so as to them
might be applied what St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of the <hi>Romans,</hi>

being of Gold <hi>(of which Metall</hi> Maimonides <hi>describes those Telesmes

Law; every Woman of that Countrey, must once in her life sit
in the Temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> and there accompany with a stranger. Some
of the Richer sort not deigning to associate themselves with the rest of
ordinary quality, are caried thither in covered Chariots: and stand
before the Temple, a long train of attendants coming after them;
the greater part do in this manner; there are many Women sitting in
the Temple of <hi>Venus</hi> Crowned with Garlands of Flowers, some co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
others going: There are also several passages distinguished by
cords, which guide the strangers to the Women; of whom they make
choice as they best like; No Woman being once set there, returns
home, untill some stranger hath cast money in her lap, and taking her
aside, lain with her. The stranger who offers this money must say, I
invoke the Goddess <hi>Mylitta</hi> for thee; the <hi>Assyrians</hi> call <hi>Venus Mylitta;</hi>
the money she must not refuse whatever it be; for it is Sacred: Neither
may the Woman deny any man, but must follow him that first offers her
money, without any choice on her part. As soon as she hath lain with
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49660:36"/>
him, and performed the Rites of the Goddess, she returns home, nor
from thence forward can be allured by any price whatsoever. Such as
are handsome are the soonest dismist; but the deformed are forced to stay
longer before they can satisfy the Law; sometimes it happens that they
attend a whole year, or two, or three in expectation. <hi>Hitherto</hi> Herodotus,

Imaginary Mythology, (though later Writers treat of it after
the same manner) but had reference to the Celestial Bodies,
which they Worshipped under several Names and Idols; It is
no less probable than consonant to the Chaldaick Doctrine, that
those other Assyrian Idols, <hi>(Ashim, Nibhaz, Tartak, Adrammelek,
Anammelek, Nisroch,)</hi> mention'd in the Scripture, were of the
same kind with the rest, and belonged to several others of the
Stars; But this conjecture is not easily evinc'd, in regard that
there is little extant of those Idols more than the bare mention of
their Names.</p>

kinds. Over the first kind he conceived <hi>Horomazes</hi> to be president, <hi>the
same</hi> whom the Oracles call <hi>the Father.</hi> Over the last, <hi>Arimanes;</hi>
Over the middle kind, <hi>Mithra,</hi> whom the Oracles call <hi>the second
Mind.</hi> And that <hi>Horomazes</hi> made himself three times as big as the
Sun (who in the Persian language is called <hi>Cyrus.) Mithra</hi> made
himself twice as big (as the Sun) who was next to <hi>Horomazes.</hi> To
which these Platonick assertions are correspondent, That all things are
about the King of all, and that all things are for him, That he
is the cause of all good things, The second is employed about the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary

things, The third is employed about the third kind of things.
The three parts into which <hi>Zoroaster</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> divided all things,
are these, The first is aeternal; The second had a beginning in
time, but is aeternal; The third is corruptible. <hi>Thus</hi> Plitho <hi>citing</hi> Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch

to the other; one, working good, the other, ill. Others call him
who is the good, God, the bad, Daemon: of this opinion was <hi>Zoroa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
the Magus, whom they report to have preceded the Trojan War
5000. years. This <hi>Zoroaster</hi> declared the names of the good, to be
<hi>Oromazes,</hi> of the bad, <hi>Arimanius,</hi> adding, that, of sensible things,
the one did most resemble light, and knowledge, the other, darkness, and
ignorance. Wherefore the Persians call <hi>Mithra</hi> the mediator. He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
taught, that, to one, we ought to offer votives and gratulatory sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
to the other, averruncative and dismal oblations. For, pound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a certain herb called <hi>Omomi</hi> in a morter they invoke hades and
darkness, then, mixing it with the blood of a slain Wolf, they carry
it forth and throw it into a place, where the beams of the Sun come not,

the ill Daemon, and that, of animals, some, as Dogs, Birds, and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupines

of which kind is this I will allege, That <hi>Oromazes</hi> was produced of
purest light, <hi>Arimanes</hi> of darkness, and that these two war against

The second, of truth; The third, of aequity; the rest of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
riches, and pleasure, which good things are attendant upon the
Maker; That then <hi>Horomazes</hi> tripled himself, and removed himself so far
from the Sun, as the Sun is distant from the Earth, and that they adorned
the Heaven with Stars, appointed one the Dog-star as Guardian and watch
for the rest; That he made 24. other Gods, and put them in an Egge, and
that <hi>Arimanius</hi> having made as many more, they broke the Egge: Whence

amongst the <hi>Sabaeans,</hi> there is not any certain agreement

this Invention to <hi>a certain Persian, named Zerodast,
contemporary with Terah</hi> father to <hi>Abraham; Zerodast</hi> and <hi>Zoroaster</hi>
are the same; whereby it appears, that <hi>Patricides</hi> means one of
those two <hi>Zoroasters,</hi> whereof one was the first Author of Sciences
amongst the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> the other introduced the same Sciences
amongst the <hi>Persians;</hi> and though he calls this <hi>Zerodast</hi> a <hi>Persian,</hi>
yet by the antiquity of the time in which he conceives him to have
liv'd, it is probable he rather intended the <hi>Chaldaean.</hi>

<hi>(saith he)</hi> conceive that the Religion of the Sabaeans was manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
by a certain King of the Persians, whose name was Tachurith.</p>
                           <p>Elmacinus <hi>mentions another</hi> Persian, <hi>to whom the same Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was attributed,</hi> In those dayes, <hi>saith he,</hi> came forth Nazarib a

Others <hi>(continues</hi> Patricides) derive the infancy of the Sabaeans
from a certain Grecian named <hi>Juvan</hi> or <hi>Javan,</hi> son of <hi>Berkley,</hi> and
him they will have to be of the City Zaittuna, which was built in
Attica. <hi>Thus he: where</hi> Hottinger <hi>for</hi> Berkley <hi>reads</hi> Mercolim,
Mercury, <hi>confirmed by</hi> Elmacinus <hi>upon the same subject.</hi> Others
<hi>saith he,</hi> affirm, that the Religion of the Sabaeans was brought forth
by a Man whose name was <hi>Juvan,</hi> son of <hi>Markoli,</hi> a Grecian, who
first found out the Science of the Stars.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>To these</hi> Patricides <hi>adds the Opinions of some</hi> others, <hi>who</hi> held
that the Authors of this Sect were some of those who were at the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Tower of Babel. <hi>Thus the</hi> Arabians.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Some attribute the Institution of the</hi> Sabaeans <hi>to</hi> Cham, <hi>son of</hi>
Noah, <hi>who</hi> being banish'd from his Fathers sight, fled thither, and
<hi>(to use the words of</hi> Lactantius) settled in that part of the Earth
which is now called Arabia. This was the first Nation that knew
not God, because the principal Founder thereof had not received the
Worship of God by Tradition from his Father: <hi>Thus</hi> Lactantius, <hi>with
whom Many agree in attributing the Original of Idolatry to</hi> Cham,
<hi>and to his son</hi> Chus <hi>the first Planter of</hi> Chaldaea, <hi>from whose son</hi>
Saba <hi>the</hi> Sabaeans <hi>were so named, and, upon this ground, some
have laboured to prove</hi> Cham <hi>and</hi> Chus, <hi>to be same with the first and
second</hi> Zoroasters, <hi>of which formerly.</hi>
                           </p>

                              <hi>Others (as</hi> Damascen) <hi>ascribe the Original of Idolatry to</hi> Serug.
Epiphanius, <hi>and the Author of the</hi> Chronicon Alexandrinum, <hi>affirm
that</hi> Hellenism began in the time of Serug, <hi>This</hi> Hellenism <hi>some
conceive the same with the</hi> Sabaean <hi>superstition; what the</hi> Greek
<hi>Fathers call</hi> Hellenism, <hi>the Rabbins term</hi> Goth, <hi>the</hi> Arabians, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giaheleiton,
the time of Ignorance and Paganism. <hi>And though
to determine any thing of those early and obscure times be very
difficult, yet we cannot doubt, but that the Idolatrous Worship
of Fire and of the Sun (ascribed to the</hi> Sabaeans) <hi>was of great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
among them, since mentioned by the most antient of Authors,</hi>

                              <hi>The Rabbinical Traditions are more particular herein:</hi> R. Solomon

with his son</hi> Abraham, <hi>in the presence of</hi> Nimrod, <hi>for breaking his
Idols, and that</hi> Abraham <hi>was thereupon cast into a fiery Furnace.</hi>
Moses Gerundensis <hi>confirms the same story, but</hi> R. Chain <hi>relates it
otherwise:</hi> Abraham, <hi>saith he,</hi> met with a Woman holding a Dish
in her hand, and the Woman asking him whether he would offer any
thing to the Gods, he took a staff, and broke the Images which the
Woman had, and threw away the staff; his Father coming thither at
the same time, demanded what was the matter, <hi>Abraham</hi> answer'd,
that she had asked him, whether he would make an offering, and
that upon his answering that he would first eat something, there arose
a dispute betwixt them: but his Father urged that the businesse was
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49660:45"/>
otherwise, and that he was heard to say many reproachful things of
<hi>Nimrod.</hi> The Controversy was brought before <hi>Nimrod</hi> the King of
Babel: he commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to worship the Fire that was set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him; <hi>Abraham</hi> answered, If so, then adore you the Water,
Water which quencheth Fire. <hi>Nimrod</hi> said to him, VVorship the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
<hi>Abraham</hi> answered, If so, worship the Clouds which distil the
Water. <hi>Nimrod</hi> said, Then worship the Clouds; whereupon <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
If it be so, then the Wind is to be worshipped which agitates
and scatters the Clouds. Again <hi>Nimrod,</hi> VVorship the Wind; but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
if so, then is Man much more to be worshipped who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
the Wind. At length <hi>Nimrod</hi> growing angry, You talk, saith
he, idlely, I worship none but the Fire, into the midst of which I will
cast thee. Let the God whom thou worshipest come and free thee by
his right hand. <hi>Aran</hi> stood by and talked; they asked of which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

Writer, of which I shall cite only so much as most particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly

who after <hi>Enoch,</hi> the son of <hi>Seth,</hi> the son of <hi>Adam,</hi> on whom peace,
wrote with a pen. This thing afterwards <hi>Edris</hi> taught his sons, and
said to them, O sons, know that you are Sabaeans, learn therefore to read
Books in your youth. Now Sabaeans are Writers, of whom the High
<hi>(he means</hi> Mahomed) said <hi>(Alk. Sur. 2.)</hi> The Sabaeans and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarenes.

Ghesira, and there he found a people of the Zabaeans who read old
Books, and believed such things as were contained in them. But
<hi>Abraham</hi> said, <q>O my God, I did not think that besides my self
and those that are with me, there had been any of the Faithful who
believed thee to be one;</q> and God breathed to <hi>Abraham</hi> this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.
<q>O <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Earth is never destitute, but that
there are some in it that dispute for God:</q> But God commanded
him to call them to his Religion, and he called them, but they would

not, saying, How shall we believe thee, when thou readest not a Book?
and God sent among them a forgetfulness of these things whicb they
knew of Sciences and Books, for they conceived the Books which they
used to be from God, and some of them believed, others not. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Zabaeans were divided, and some of them believed, <hi>viz.</hi> the
Barhameans, who did not separate themselves from <hi>Abraham</hi> of
blessed memory, but the rest followed their own Religion very eagerly,
<hi>viz.</hi> those who are in the land of Charan, who went not with <hi>Abraham</hi>
into Syria, and said, we follow the Religion of <hi>Seth, Edris,</hi> and
<hi>Noah; Thus according to</hi> Kissaeus, <hi>the Religion of the</hi> Sabaeans <hi>was
the same with that of the</hi> Haranaeans, <hi>or</hi> Mesopotamians. <hi>What he

make the first day sacred to the Sun, the second, to the Moon; the

<hi>Mahumed ben Isaac,</hi> cited by <hi>Hottinger;</hi> They begin the year from the
moneth <hi>Nisan,</hi> of which they keep holy the first, second, and third
dayes; adoring and praying to their Goddess <hi>Beltha:</hi> they go to her
Temples, sacrifising Sacrifices, and burning living Creatures:
On the sixt day of the same moneth they kill a Bull to their God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse
the Moon; and towards the evening of the same day eat it:
On the eighth day they a keep Fast, and likewise celebrate (at night)
a Feast in honour of the seven Gods and of the Daemons; offering
a Lamb to the God of the Blind <hi>(Mars):</hi> On the fifteenth day is
the Festival of <hi>Sammael,</hi> (by this name the <hi>Talmudists</hi> understand
the Devil) celebrated with many Sacrifices, Holocausts, and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings:
On the twentieth they visit a <hi>Coenobium</hi> of the <hi>Harranae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
called <hi>Cadi,</hi> where they kill three Oxen, one to <hi>Saturn;</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
to <hi>Mars,</hi> the blind God; the third to the Moon: they kill
likewise nine Lambs, seven to their seven Gods (the Planets) one
to the God of the Geniusses, and one to the God of the Houres.
They likewise burn many Lambs and Cocks. On the 28. day,
they go into the Temple which they have in the City <hi>Saba,</hi> at a
certain gate of <hi>Charran,</hi> called the gate <hi>Assarah;</hi> and kill to <hi>Hermes</hi>
their God a great Bull; as also seven Lambs to their seven Gods;
one to the God of the Daemons, and to the God of the Houres,
eating and drinking; but they burnt nothing of any Beast that day.</p>

                           <p>The 23. day of the third moneth they keep in honour of <hi>Sammael,</hi>
whom they affirm to be <hi>the God that maketh the Arrows fly;</hi> the
<hi>Cumar,</hi> or Priest, makes an Arrow take fire twelve times, by
rubbing another stick against it: the last time he creeps upon the

middle of it, called the Festival <hi>Albukal, of the weeping VVomen:</hi>
The original of which is thus related by <hi>R. Maimonides:</hi> In the same
Book, saith he, they tell a story of a certain Idolatrous Pseudo-Prophet,
named <hi>Thammuz:</hi> who calling upon the King to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the seven Planets, and the twelve signs of the Zodiack,
and being by the King put to an ignominious death, the same
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49660:48"/>
night in which he was slain, all the Images from all parts of
the Earth met in the Palace which was erected at <hi>Babylon</hi> to the
great Golden Image of the Sun, suspended betwixt Heaven and
Earth: There this Image of the Sun fell down prostrate in
the midst, and (all the rest of the Images standing round about
it) bewailed <hi>Thammuz,</hi> and began to relate what had happened
to him; whereupon the rest of the Images fell a-weeping, and
lamented all that night: But assoon as the morning appeared
they all flew away and returned home to their several Temples.
Hence came the Custome, that on the first day of the moneth
<hi>Thammuz (Iune)</hi> they weep, lament, and bewail <hi>Thammuz.</hi>
This Custome of <hi>VVomen weeping for Tammuz</hi> is mentioned also

Cocks, and as many Hens; He who made a prayer and request

the Lord of Fortune accepts not his Prayer, nor Offerings, nor
Sacrifices. On the 27. and 28. they have their Mysteries, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49660:48"/>
Offerings, and Holocausts to <hi>Sammael,</hi> (who is the greatest

defend them, and bestow good fortune on them.</p>
                           <p>The seventh moneth, which the <hi>Syrians</hi> and <hi>Sabaeans</hi> call <hi>the
first Tischri,</hi> hath peculiar Rites, thus described by the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor:
About the middle of this Moneth, they burn Meat to the
dead, in this manner: Every one buys of every sort of meat that
is in the Market; of all kind of Flesh, Fruits, green and dry;
they likewise dresse it several wayes; all which they burn in the
night-time to the dead, and wish it the thigh-bone of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel;
they also pour mixed Wine upon the fire, for the dead
to drink.</p>
                           <p>In the eighth moneth, which is called the <hi>later Tischri,</hi> they fast
on the 21. day, and so on, for nine dayes, the last of which is the
29. this day they do in honour of the Lord of Fortunes, &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>The ninth moneth, called <hi>the first Canun,</hi> is chiefly sacred to
<hi>Venus;</hi> On the fourth day they set up a Tabernacle, which they
call the Bed of <hi>Beltha;</hi> adorning it with several Leaves, Fruits,
Roses, &amp;c. Before they offer their Sacrifices of Beasts and
Birds, they say, Let these Sacrifices be destined to our God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse
<hi>Beltha;</hi> this they do for seven dayes: all wich time they
burn many Beasts to their Gods and Goddesses. On the 30.
day of the same moneth, the Priest sits in a High Chair,
to which he gets up by nine steps; and, taking in his hand a
stick of Tamarisk, stretcheth it out to them all, and striketh
every one of them with it three or five or seven times. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he makes a Discourse to them, wherein he declareth to
the Congregation their continuance, multitude, places, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
above all other Nations; he likewise tells them the
largenesse of their Empire, and the dayes of their Reign: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which he comes down from the Chair, and they eat of the
things offered to the Idols, and drink: and the Prince exacts
of every one of them this day two Drachmes to the Exchec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.</p>
                           <p>The tenth moneth, called <hi>the other Canun,</hi> seems particularly
devoted to the Moon; for on the 24. day thereof is the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of the Lord, that is, the Moon, at what time they cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
the Rites of <hi>Sammael,</hi> sacrificing, and burning fourscore li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Creatures four-footed Beasts and Fowl; They also eat and
drink, and burn Badi, sticks or canes of Palm slender at the bottom,
to their Gods and Goddesses.</p>
                           <p>In the eleventh moneth, <hi>Sijubat,</hi> they fast seven dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
beginning from the ninth day, upon which they proclame
a Fast to the Sun, who is the great Lord, the Lord of good:
They eat not in all this time any thing of Milk; nor drink Wine;

lesse probable, in regard they lye dispersed amongst several Authors;
nor are they to be neglected, in that they have been held in great ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration

since those (as he acknowledgeth) were by the Platonick Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,

and <hi>demonstrated to be spurious and suppositions.</hi>

Hear the inscriptions, and you will believe it. The Chaldaick Books, (if they
are Books and not rather Treasures) are, The Oracles of <hi>Aben Esra, Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roaster</hi>

                     <hi>Ottho Heurnius,
anno</hi> 1619. under
the Title of <hi>The sincere Magical Oracles of</hi> Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roaster
<hi>King of</hi> Bactria, <hi>and Prince of the Magi;</hi> but <hi>Heurnius</hi> under
the pretence of<note n="m" place="margin">pag.</note> 
                     <hi>putting them into good Latin,</hi> (as he calls it) <hi>and
polishing them with a rougher File,</hi> hath patch'd up and corrupted
what <hi>Patricius</hi> deliver'd faithfully and sincerely, endeavouring
to put these Fragments into a Continued Discourse, which in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are nothing Coherent but Dispersed amongst several Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Patricius</hi> indeed hath taken much Learned pains in the Collection
of them; but with lesse Regard to their Measures and Numbers,
and (as from thence may be shown) sometimes of the Words
themselves: nor is there any certain means to redresse this Omission,
by comparing them with the Authors out of which he took them,
since few of those are extant, neither doth he (as he professeth to
have done) affix the Names of the Authors to the several Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
except to some few at the beginning; However, we shall
give them here according to his Edition, that being the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
together with such Additions as we meet withall else where,
and some Conjectures to supply the Defect we mention'd.</p>
                  <p>And whereas many of these Oracles are so Broken and Obscure,
that they may at first sight seem rather Ridiculous than Weighty,
yet he who shall consider, that as many of them as are explain'd by
<hi>Pletho, Psellus,</hi> and others, would without those Explications seem
no lesse absurd than the rest, but being explain'd disclose the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> in a profound and extraordinary manner, will
easily believe all the rest (even those which appear least intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
to be of the same kind, and consequently ought no more to
have been omitted than any of the rest.</p>

                     <l>

                  <p>THe <hi>Magi</hi> that are followers of <hi>Zoroaster,</hi> as also many others,
hold that the Human Soul is immortal; and descended from
above to serve the mortal Body, that is, to operate therein for a
certain time; and to Animate, and Adorn it to her power; and
then returns to the place from which she came. And whereas there
are many Mansions there for the Soul, one <hi>wholly-bright,</hi> another
<hi>wholly-dark;</hi> others betwixt both, <hi>partly-bright, partly-dark:</hi> The
Soul, being descended from that which is wholly-bright, into the
Body, if she perform her Office well, runs back into the same place;
but if not well, she retires into worse Mansions, according to the
things which she hath done in Life. The Oracle therefore sayeth,
<hi>Seek thou the Souls path,</hi> or the way by which the Soul flowed into
thee; or by what course <hi>(viz</hi> of Life) having performed thy
charge toward the Body, thou mayst Mount up to the same place
from which thou didst flow down, <hi>viz.</hi> the same Track of the
Soul, <hi>joyning action to sacred speech. By sacred speech,</hi> he understands
that which concerns Divine Worship; by action, Divine Rites. The
Oracle therefore sayeth, that to this Exaltation of the Soul, both
speech concerning Divine Worship (Prayers,) and Religious
Rites (Sacrifices) are requisite.</p>

the Terrestrial and Mortal Body, the Earth: for by the Earth he
understands mortal Nature, as by the fire frequently the Divine;

Planets, beneath which there is seated a certain dire and unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Necessity: The Oracle therefore adviseth, that thou stoop not

                  </q>
                  <p>The Followers of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> conceive the Soul to be a
Substance not wholly separate from all Body, nor wholly inseparate;
but partly separate, partly inseparate; separable potentially, but
ever inseparate actually. For they assert three kinds of Forms, One
wholly separate from matter, the Supercelestial Intelligences; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wholly inseparable from matter, having a Substance not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
by it self but dependant on matter; together with which Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which is somtime dissolved by reason of its nature subject to Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
this kind of Soul is dissolved also and perisheth: this kind
they hold to be wholly irrational. Betwixt these they place a middle
kind, the rational Soul, differing from the Supercelestiall Intelligences,
for that it alwayes co-exists which Matter; and from the irrational
kind, for that it is not dependant on matter; but, on the contrary, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it is dependant on it, and it hath a proper substance potentially
subsistent by it self; it is also indivisible, as well as the supercelestial
Intelligences, and performing some works in some manner allyed to
theirs, being it self also busied in the knowledge and contemplation
of beings even unto the Supreme God, and for this reason is incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible.
This kind of Soul is alwayes co-existent with an Aetherial
Body as it's <hi>Vehiculum,</hi> which she by continual approximation
maketh also immortal: neither is this her Vehiculum inanimate in
it selfe, but is it self animated with the other species of the Soul
the irrational, (which the Wise call the Image of the rational
Soul) adorned with Fantasie and Sense which seeth and hears it self
whole through whole, and is furnished with all the Senses and with
all the rest of the irrational faculties of the Soul. Thus by the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
faculty of this Body, Phantasie, the rational Soul, is continually
joyned to such a Body and by such a Body sometimes the humane
Soul is joyned with a Mortal Body by a certain affinity of Nature,
the whole being infolded in the whole enlivening Spirit of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryon.
This Vehiculum it selfe being of the nature of a Spirit. The
Daemons Souls differ not much from the humane, onely they are
more noble and use more noble Vehicles: Moreover, they cannot be
mingled with corruptible Nature: Likewise the Souls of the
Starres are much better than the Daemons, and use better Vehicules;
are Bodies splendid by reason of the greatnesse of the operative fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty:
These Doctrines concerning the Soul the Magi, followers of
<hi>Zoroastres,</hi> seem to have used long before. Defile not this kind of
Spirit of the Soul, sayeth the Oracle, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

He calls it Superficies, not as if it had not a triple Dimension
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49660:71"/>
for it is a Body; but to signifie its extraordinary rarity: nor make it
become grosse by accession of more matter to its Bulk: for this Spirit
of the Soul becomes grosse, if it declines too much towards the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Body.</p>

the Irrational; of the Irrational, Nature; of Nature, the Body;
of the Body, Matter. Here the <hi>Chaldaick Oracle</hi> calleth the irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Soul the Image of the rational, for it is connatural to it in
Man, and yet worse then it. It sayeth, moreover, that there is a
part assigned to the Image in the circumlucid Region, that is to say,
the irrational Soul, which is the Image of the rational Soul, being
purified by Vertues in this Life, after the Dissolution of the human
Life, ascends to the place above the Moon, and receives its Lot in
the <hi>Circumlucid place,</hi> that is, which shineth on every side, and is
splendid throughout; for the Place beneath the Moon is circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebulous,
that is, dark on every side: but the Lunary, partly Lucid,
and partly Dark, that is, one half bright, the other half dark; but
the place above the Moon is circumlucid or bright throughout.
Now the Oracle saith, that the circumlucid Place, is not design'd
only for the rational Soul, but for its Image also, or the irrational
Soul is destin'd to the circumlucid place, when as it cometh out of
the Body bright and pure, for the Graecian Doctrine asserting the
irrational Soul to be immortal, also exalts it up to the Elements
under the Moon: but the <hi>Chaldaick Oracle,</hi> it being pure and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous

above the Moon. These are the Doctrines of the <hi>Chald<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This Oracle is recited by <hi>Plotinus</hi> in his Book of the Eduction of
the irrational Soul; it is an Excellent and Transcendent Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
It adviseth, that a Man busie not himself about the <hi>going
forth of the Soul,</hi> nor take care how it shall go out of the Body;
but remit the Businesse of its dissolution to the Course of Nature;
for, Anxiety and Solicitude about the Solution of the Body, and the
Eduction of the Soul out of it, draws away the Soul from better
Cogitations, and busieth it in such cares that the Soul cannot be
perfectly purifyed; for if Death come upon us at such time as we
are busied about this Dissolution, the Soul goeth forth not quite
free, but retaining something of a passionate Life. Passion the
Chaldaean defines, A Mans sollicitous thinking of Death; for we
ought not to think of any thing, but of the more Excellent Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations;
neither concerning these ought we to be sollicitous, but
resigning our selves to the Angelical and Diviner powers, which raise
us up, and shutting up all the Organs of Sense in the Body and in
the Soul also without Distractive cares and sollicitudes, We must
follow God, who calls us.</p>
                  <p>Some interpret this Oracle more simply; <hi>Bring it not out lest it
go forth, having something:</hi> that is, Anticipate not thy natural
Death, although thou be wholly given up to Philosophy; for as
yet thou hast not a compleat Expiation; So that if the Soul passe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49660:74"/>
out of the Body by that way of Educting, it will go forth retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
something of mortal Life: for if we Men are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The sacred Paradise of piety, according to the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> is not
that which the Book of <hi>Moses</hi> describes, but the Meadow of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limest
Contemplations, in which there are several Trees of Virtues;
and the Wood, (or Trunk) of Knowledge, of Good and Evil,
that is, Dijudicative prudence which distinguisheth Good from
Evil; likewise the Tree of Life, that is, the Plant of Divine Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
which bringeth forth to the Soul, the Fruit of a more holy
and better Life; In this Paradise, therefore, grow Vertue, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and Aequity; Vertue is one in General, but hath many
Species; Wisdome comprehendeth within it self all the Vertues,
which the Divine Mind pronounceth, as only unspeakable.</p>

and served the Body, and how Men cherishing and raising it up by
the Exercise of Divine Rites, may reduce it to the place whence it
came. <hi>Uniting Action to sacred Reason,</hi> is to be understood thus.
<hi>Sacred Reason</hi> (or Discourse) in us is the Intellectual Life, or rather
the supreme faculty of the Soul, which the Oracle elsewhere styles
the <hi>flower of the Mind;</hi> but this sacred Reason cannot by its own
guidance aspire to the more sublime Institution, and to the compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of Divinity; the work of Piety leads it by the hand to God,
by assistance of Illuminations from thence: but the <hi>Chaldaean,</hi> by
the Telestick Science, perfects (or initiates) the Soul by the power
of Materials here on Earth. To this sacred Reason, saith he, when
thou hast united Action, that is, joyn'd the Work of Initiation to
the sacred Reason, or better faculty of the Soul.</p>
                  <p>Our Theologist <hi>Gregory</hi> raiseth the Soul to the more Divine
things by reason and Contemplation: by Reason which is in us the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49660:75"/>
best and most intellectual faculty; by Contemplation, which is
an illumination comming from above: But <hi>Plato</hi> affirms, that we

But the <hi>Chaldaean</hi> saith, that there is no other Means for us to arrive at
God, but by strengthning the Vehiculum of the Soul by material
Rites; for it supposeth that the Soul is purifyed by Stones and
Herbs and Charmes and is rendred expedit for Assent.</p>

praiseth all violent Death, because the Soul, which leaveth the Body
with trouble, abhorrs this Life, and hateth conversation with the
