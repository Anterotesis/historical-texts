            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Paper which was Seized in the E. of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Closet, by <hi>Fran. Gwin,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> one of the Clerks of His Majesties Most Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Privy Council, and Read <hi>Novemb.</hi> 24. 1681. at the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> before His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Commissioners of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WE the Knights, &amp;c. Finding to the grief of our Hearts, the Popish Priests and Iesuits, with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, and their Adherents and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betrors, have for several years last past pursued a most pernicious and hellish Plot, to root out the true Protestant Religion as a pestilent Heresie, to take away the Life of our Gracious King, to subvert our Laws and Liberties, and to set up Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary power and Popery.</p>
            <p>And it being Notorious that they have béen highly encouraged by the Countenance and Protection given and procured for them by J. D. of Y. and by their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of his succéeding to the Crown, and that through crafty Popish Councils, his Designs have so far prevailed that he hath created many and great Dependents upon him by his bestowing Offices and Preferments both in Church and State.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49204:3"/>
It appearing also to us, That by his Influence, Mercenary Forces have béen levied and kept on Foot for his secret Designs contrary to our Laws; the Officers thereof having béen named and appointed by him, to the appparent hazard of His Majesties Person, our Religion and Government, if the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger had not béen timely foreséen by several Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and part of those Forces with great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, caused by them to be Disbanded at the Kingdoms great Expence: And it being evident, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the continual endeavours of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to deliver His Majesty from the Councils, and out of the power of the said D. yet his Interest in the Ministry of State and others have béen so prevalent, that Parliaments have béen unreasonably Prorogued, and Dissolved when they have béen in hot pursuit of the Popish Conspiracies, and ill Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of State their Assistants.</p>
            <p>And that the said D. in order to reduce all into his own power, hath procured the Garrisons, the Army and Ammunition, and all the power of the Seas and Souldiery, and Lands belonging to these thrée Kingdoms, to be put into the hands of his party and their Adherents, even in opposition to the Advice and Order of the last Parliament.</p>
            <p>And as we considering with heavy Hearts how greatly the Strength, Reputation and Treasure of the Kingdom both at Sea and Land is Wasted and Consumed, and lost by the intricate expensive ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of these wicked destructive Designs; and finding the same Councils after exemplary Iustice upon some of the Conspirators, to be still pursued with the utmost devilish malice, and desire of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49204:3"/>
whereby his Majesty is in continual hazard of being Murdered to make way for the said D's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement to the Crown, and the whole Kingdom in such case is destitute of all security of their Religion, Laws, Estates, and Liberty, sad experience in the Case, Quéen Mary having proved the wisest Laws to be of little force to kéep out Popery and Tyranny un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Popish Prince.</p>
            <p>We have therefore endeavoured in a Parliamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way by a Bill for the purpose to Bar and Exclude the said Duke from the Succession to the Crown, and to Banish him for ever out of these Kingdoms of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland and Ireland. But the first Means of the King and Kingdoms Safety being utterly rejected, and we left almost in Despair of obtaining any real and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual security, and knowing our selves to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted to Advise and Act for the preservation of His Majesty and the Kingdom, and being perswaded in our Consciences that the dangers aforesaid are so eminent and pressing, that there ought to be no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay of the best means that are in our power to secure the Kingdom against them. We have thought fit to propose to all true Protestants an Union amongst themselves by solemn and sacred promise of mutual Defence and Assistance in the preservation of the true Protestant Religion, His Majesties Person and Royal State, and our Laws, Liberties and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and we hold it our bounden Duty to joyn our selves for the same intent in a Declaration of our United Affections and Resolutions in the Form in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:49204:4"/>
I A. B. Do in the presence of God Solemnly Promise, Uow, and Protest to maintain and defend to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of my Power, with my Person and Estate, the true Protestant Religion against Popery and all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish superstition, Idolatry, or Innovasion, and all those who do or shall endeavour to spread or advance it within this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>I will also as far as in me lies, maintain and defend His Majesties Royal Person and Estate; as also the power and priviledge of Parliaments, the lawful Rights and Liberties of the Subject, against all Incroachments and Usurpation of Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power whatsoever, and endeavour intirely to Disband all such mercenary Forces as we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to believe, were raised to Advance it, and are still kept up in and about the City of London to the great Amazement and Terrour of all the good people of the Land.</p>
            <p>Moreover J D. of Y. having publickly professed and owned the Popish Religion, and notoriously gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Life and Birth to the Damnable and Hellish Plots of the Papists against His Majesties Person, the Protestant Religion, and the Government of this Kingdom; I will never consent that the said J. D. of Y. or any other, who is or hath béen a Papist, or any ways adher'd to the Papists in their wicked Designs be admitted to the Succession of the Crown of England. But by all lawful means and by forte of Arms, it néed so require, according to my Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, will oppose him, and endeavour to Subdue, Expel and Destroy him, if he come into England, or the Dominions thereof; and séek by force to set up his pretended Title, and all such as shall Adhere
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49204:4"/>
unto him, or raise any War, Tumult, or Sedition for him, or by his Command, as publick Enemies of our Laws, Religion and Country.</p>
            <p>To this end we, and every one of us whose hands are here under-written, do most willingly bind our selves and every one of us unto the other, joyntly and severally, in the bond of one firm and loyal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety or Association, and do promise and vow before God, That with our joynt and particular Forces we will oppose and pursue unto Destruction all such as upon any Title whatsoever shall oppose the Iust and Righteous ends of this Association; and Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Protect and Defend all such as shall enter into it, and the just performance of the true intent and meaning of it. And lest this just and pious work should be any ways obstructed or hindered for want of Discipline and Conduct, or any evil-minded persons under pretence of raising Forces for the service of this Association, should attempt or commit Disorders, we will follow such Orders as we shall from time to time receive from this present Parliament, whilest it shall be sitting, or the major part of the Members of both Houses subscribing this Association when it shall be, Prorogued or Dissolved, and obey such Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers as shall by them be set over us in the several Countries, Cities, and Burroughs, until the next méeting of this or another Parliament, and will then shew the same Obedience and Submission unto it, and those who shall be of it.</p>
            <p>Neither will we for any respect of Persons or Causes, or for Fear, or Reward separate our selves from this Association, or fail in the Prosecution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of during our Lives, upon pain of being by the rest of

us prosecuted, and suppressed as perjur'd persons, and publick Enemies to God, the King, and our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Countrey.</p>
            <p>To which pains and punishments we do volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily submit our selves, and every one of us, without benefit of any Colour or Pretence to excuse us.</p>
            <q>In Witnesses of all which Premisses to be inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly kept, we do to this present Writing put our Hands and Seals, and shall be most ready to accept and admit any others hereafter into this Society and Association.</q>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU have turned me to a hard Chapter; for so it is, to give you my opinion of the <hi>Association,</hi> that lyes under so great debate. I must tell you, 'tis a <hi>Riddle</hi> not easie to be deciphered; The <hi>Assertors</hi> of it call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a <hi>Society</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>The Bond of one Firm and Loyal Society,</hi> after the Protest: And <hi>This Society</hi> at the end.</note>, and twice for falling. This, Sir, is the <hi>Distinctive Character</hi> of the <hi>Jesuites,</hi> and you must imagine an Instrument of such a <hi>Make,</hi> is full of <hi>Mental Reserves</hi> and <hi>Equivocations;</hi> for seeing they have so auspiciously assumed <hi>their Title</hi> and <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellative,</hi> 'twill be hard if you will not allow them to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate something of their <hi>Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Body</hi> of this Monster has already been most accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dissected by skilful hands, and ingenious Lectures read upon every <hi>Member, Vein</hi> and <hi>Muscle</hi> of it. If you think there may be something yet in the Belly of this <hi>Trojan</hi> Horse, that is worthy of your notice, at your command, I shall venture in to search it.</p>
            <p>We the Knights: They were influenced (it seems) by one of <hi>the other House,</hi> in whose <hi>Custody</hi> this Instrument
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49204:6"/>
was found, if he were not rather the crafty <hi>Contriver</hi> of it. A person so well known, there's no need of any new Character to describe him: How he has play'd <hi>fast and loose</hi> both with King and Subject, needs no other instance to demonstrate than the shutting up of the <hi>Exchequer.</hi> Having been at the head of so many Seditious <hi>Juncto</hi>'s, Trayterous <hi>Cabals, Councils of State,</hi> usurped and Tyrannical Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, you may very well conclude, though he hath learn'd the Art of <hi>shifting</hi> sides, he is not over-stockt with <hi>Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> If any insolency in his carriage has made him <hi>jealous</hi> that he is obnoxious to a <hi>high</hi> displeasure, no wonder the discontents arising from such <hi>Reflections,</hi> should prompt him to the courses he has taken; 'Tis natural for the wounded <hi>Deer</hi> to run into the common <hi>Herd</hi> for shelter. And such is the Spirit of our little <hi>Heroe,</hi> whatever stands in the way of his Ambition, he'll leave nothing unattempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to remove it. Let Religion sink or swim among the States General, <hi>Delenda Carthago</hi> is his <hi>Motto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let's proceed: We the Knights, &amp;c.] This [&amp;c.] is a fatal <hi>Character,</hi> if we can remember that <hi>Et caetera-Oath</hi> which made such a hideous noise in the year 40.</p>

               <l>Who views it well, with the same eye beholds</l>
               <l>The old false Serpent in his numerous folds.</l>
               <l>The Banes are ask'd, and now the times give way,</l>

Something certainly is involved in the subtile twirl of this <hi>Dragons</hi> Tayl: If they be <hi>True Protestants,</hi> in the sense of these <hi>Associates,</hi> they must be such as Protest against the <hi>present</hi> Church of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Succession</hi> of the Crown, and the <hi>Brittish</hi> Monarchy.

            <p>And they say, Finding to the grief of our Hearts, the Popish Priests and Iesuites, with the Papists, and their Adberents and Abettors, have, for several years last past, pursued a most pernitious and Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Plot, to root out the True Protestant Religion, as a pestilent Heresie, to take away the life of our Gracious King, to subvert our Laws and Liberties, and to set up Arbitrary Power and Popery.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Have not these pretended Protestants and <hi>Et caetera</hi>'s been eager (even to <hi>Sedition</hi> and <hi>Blood)</hi> to throw down the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closure,</hi> to <hi>Repeal</hi> those Laws, and <hi>subvert</hi> that Church-Government which have kept out Popery ever since the <hi>Reformation?</hi> Have they not given their <hi>Emissaries</hi> advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by their Projected <hi>Toleration</hi> and <hi>Indulgence,</hi> and shelter'd the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Jaesuites</hi> (whom they pretend to <hi>Associate</hi> against) in their own <hi>Conventicles:</hi> Nay, to come home to the business, have not these men <hi>Rivall'd</hi> the Papists in their Treasons?

            <p>For, if we put in <hi>Fanaticism</hi> instead of <hi>Popery,</hi> and change the <hi>Popish Priests</hi> and <hi>Jesuites,</hi> into <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents,</hi> with their <hi>Adherents</hi> and <hi>Abettars,</hi> the design (they set on foot) has not only been, for several years pursued;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49204:8"/>
but effectually <hi>performed</hi> and really <hi>executed,</hi> as we very well remember by sad and woful experience. For did they not <hi>root out</hi> the True Protestant Religion, establisht here by the <hi>Authority</hi> of pious <hi>Princes,</hi> as well as the <hi>Blood</hi> of Holy <hi>Martyrs?</hi> Did they not take away the <hi>Life</hi> of our most <hi>Gracious King,</hi> the most incomparable Prince of Christendome? Did they not subvert our <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,</hi> and set up <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> amongst us? All this they did most accursedly accomplish to the astonishment of all Christendome: And yet we have reason to believe, that such of these <hi>Associators</hi> as were ingaged in it (and perhaps they were not a few) never lookt upon't as such a pernicious and Hellish <hi>Plot,</hi> nor were toucht with such <hi>Remorse and grief of Heart,</hi> for that <hi>actual Guilt and Notorious Crime,</hi> as they pretend to have upon the account of this, which is but their own <hi>jealousie</hi> and <hi>surmise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the most prudent and faithful <hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>State</hi> cannot escape their <hi>Malicious</hi> Insinuations, we are not at all to wonder at: 'Tis the frequent practice of all <hi>Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents,</hi> when they become <hi>Seditious:</hi> For though it be the <hi>Majesty</hi> of the Government they aim at, yet they think they can no way wound <hi>That,</hi> with so much safety, and to so great effect, as through the sides of such Worthy <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To traduce the <hi>Duke</hi> is the main Design of this <hi>Associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And indeed, if we well observe it, 'tis an unusual strain of Modesty in them, that they do not positively, as well as by implication, impute it to <hi>the Devilish Malice, and desire of Revenge</hi> in his <hi>Royal Highness,</hi> that his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty is in continual hazard of being Murdered, to make way for his own advancement to the Crown.</hi> For they say expressly, <hi>That by his Influence, Mercenary forces have been levied, and kept on foot for his secret Designs:</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:49204:8"/>
Which, it seems, are not so <hi>secret</hi> but they can, if not penetrate, yet conjecture and imagine them. But as the King is most concerned herein, so hath he best opportunity to examine it and find it out, if there were any truth in't, or colour for it.</p>
            <p>Whereas it is suggested, that <hi>the levying of those Forces was unaccountable,</hi> their <hi>Disbanding difficult; and at the Kingdoms great expence:</hi> There's not a little Malice coucht in that allegation. To what purpose <hi>those</hi> Forces were raised, is not unknown to such as have a mind to understand; and the Service which some of them perform'd, was not <hi>secret,</hi> but in the open <hi>Field,</hi> and so <hi>eminent,</hi> that Foreign States and Princes will remember it to their Honour.</p>
            <p>But let them ask themselves this question, were <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>'s Forces Levied, or kept up, or Disbanded, without the Kingdoms great expence? Or will the Forces design'd by these <hi>Associators</hi> be raised without money? and will not their <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Conductors</hi> expect their Pay? and at whose charge must all this be? and how shall they be Disbanded? do they Promise and Vow here, that <hi>They will never Separate themselves from this Association, or fail in the prosecution thereof during their lives?</hi> And (if they were once in Arms) we might believe them, though they were not engag'd upon such <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Eternal pain</hi> as is due to <hi>Perjur'd</hi> persons.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Party</hi> hath sometimes been very earnest to <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broil</hi> his Majesty in a War with the <hi>French</hi> King, but without any <hi>fond</hi> or considerable <hi>Subsidy</hi> to maintain it. To what end this was projected, wise men will judge, but I shall forbear to mention.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:49204:9"/>
But because they cannot to easily embroll his Majesty <hi>abroad,</hi> they resolve to do it <hi>at home.</hi> To this effect, several <hi>Plots</hi> have been set a foot, and they have made their utmost advantage of them. And because the great <hi>obstacle</hi> (which is their greatest <hi>Grievance</hi> too) is, <hi>The</hi> Militia <hi>in the Kings hand;</hi> They design very dutifully (no doubt) to feize it without his leave, that they may have it once again in their Power, to set up <hi>Committees</hi> of <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> in every County, to make <hi>Delinquents,</hi> and then to <hi>Tax, Decimate</hi> and <hi>Sequester,</hi> or make them <hi>Compound</hi> for their <hi>own</hi> Estates at their pleasure: And what will follow but a <hi>High Court of Justice,</hi> to bring <hi>whom</hi> they please, to (what they please to call) <hi>Condign punishment,</hi> and at last to extinguish (as much as in them lyes) the <hi>Royal Family,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> root and branch. And this shall be voted the <hi>Defence</hi> of the <hi>Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> and our <hi>Liberties,</hi> without our <hi>Properties,</hi> the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> against the encroachments of an <hi>Arbitrary Power.</hi> Yea, and the <hi>Janizaries</hi> they employ, shall not wear the name of <hi>Mercenary Souldiers,</hi> but be rewarded, as <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s were (for their good service) and be <hi>honour</hi>'d with the Character and Title of <hi>English</hi> Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the <hi>Godly Party.</hi> These are the <hi>Priviledges</hi> of the Saints.</p>
            <p>But we use to say, <hi>The Burnt Child dreads the Fire:</hi> And I hope this <hi>Generous</hi> and <hi>Manly</hi> Nation is not grown too <hi>stupid</hi> to be taught by <hi>Proverbs,</hi> nor yet become so infatuated as to forget so fresh and chargeable an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:49204:9"/>
But they take it for granted, <hi>'Tis notorious, that</hi> 
               <q>the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Priests and Jesuits, with the Papists and their Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, </q>
               <hi>have been highly encouraged by the Countenance and Protection given and procured for them by</hi> J. D. <hi>of</hi> Y. and that <hi>He has publickly profess'd and own'd the Popish Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This they peremptorily averr: but it can hardly be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that <hi>Any</hi> free Prince, at this time of day, should be so fast asleep, or ill advised, as to make himself the <hi>Pope's</hi> Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, to admit a <hi>Supremacy</hi> into his Realm <hi>paramount</hi> to his own; To have his own Royal Authority <hi>confronted</hi> by the <hi>Check</hi> of foreign <hi>Bulls</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> or the <hi>Treasure</hi> of his Kingdoms exhausted by such <hi>Engines</hi> of Extortion, as can serve him to no other end, but to endanger, impoverish, and inthrall him.</p>
            <p>Consider but the Sense of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, who will not brook that pretended Supremacy in the lowest state of their Declination; or the present Posture and Resentments of the <hi>French,</hi> who seem so weary of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Inchroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Usurpation, that they <hi>kick</hi> and <hi>wince,</hi> as if they were in pain and Travel, to throw his <hi>Holiness</hi> out of the <hi>Saddle,</hi> in those Dominions.</p>
            <p>As for his <hi>Royal Highness,</hi> perhaps he may disdain to have his Integrity questioned by a common <hi>Test:</hi> many times <hi>Great Spirits</hi> are irritated by such Attempts, (which are therefore, for the most part, better let alone than put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;) they will not be forced by such <hi>Screwed Engines</hi> to gratifie their Adversaries with an open profession of that, which notwithstanding, in their Hearts they may most sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly believe.</p>
            <p>Yet we cannot take it for a wonder, if his <hi>Royal</hi> Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity, and the deep Resentments he has for his Blessed <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>'s Sufferings under the <hi>bloody</hi> hands of seditious Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, will not suffer him to be <hi>hector'd</hi> by them into an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of their <hi>Fanatical</hi> Delusions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:49204:10"/>
But his <hi>Royal Highness</hi> is so well satisfied with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as by Law <hi>established,</hi> that he professeth a great Kindness and <hi>Veneration</hi> for it, for the very <hi>Loyalty</hi> remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in her Religion above all others; and for that Reason, upon all occasions he declares his Readiness to preserve and support it.</p>
            <p>Nor have we only his <hi>Highness</hi>'s bare Word or Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to relye upon, his eminent <hi>Deeds</hi> are such a signal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplification hereof in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that the Bishops of that Kingdom have made their Profession to my Lords <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in these Words;</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Since his Royal Highness's coming to this Kingdom, we find our Case much chang'd to the better, and our Church and Order (which through the cunning and power of their Adversaries, were exposed to extream hazard and contempt) sensibly relieved and rescued; which, next to the watchful Providence of God, (that mercifully superintends his Church) we can ascribe to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so much as to his Royal Highness's gracious owning and vigilant protection of us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Upon all occasions he gives fresh Instances of his eminent Zeal against the most unreasonable Schism, which by renting, threatens the Subversion of our Church and Religion; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns himself, as a Patron to us in all our publick, and even personal Interests; so that all men take notice of his signal Kindness to us, and observe that he looks upon the Enemies of the Church, as Adversaries to the Monarchy it self: nor did we ever propose or offer to his Royal Highness any Rational Expedient which might conduce for the Relief or Security of the Church, which he did not readily embrace and effectuate.</hi>

If <hi>Officers</hi> have been <hi>named</hi> and <hi>appointed</hi> by his <hi>Royal Highness,</hi> none can blame it, but such as have an Ambition to get <hi>that</hi> Power into their own hands. And, if it were lodged in the hands of these <hi>Associates,</hi> would the hazard of the King's Person, or of our Religion and Government be any whit less, or less apparent?

            <p>That <hi>Parliaments</hi> have been unreasonably <hi>Prorogued</hi> and <hi>Dissolved,</hi> is another of their <hi>specious</hi> Allegations: but herein his <hi>Majesty</hi> has given such ample Satisfaction, as su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persedes all attempts of the like Nature; For, <hi>What can the Man do who cometh after the</hi>

and transcendent Goodness which the Finger of God has impress'd upon his <hi>Royal</hi> Bosom? A <hi>Declaration</hi> so full of <hi>Princely Grace</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and generally so suitable to their Wishes, that it did but <hi>anticipate</hi> what of Duty (as well as Interest and Inclination) should have been their own <hi>Petition?</hi> and that it left them no room, but for the lively Expressions of their Joy and Gratitude?

            <p>Though we have as great a Reverence for <hi>Parliaments</hi> as we ought, yet we cannot but reflect upon't with Grief, that the Composition of those Assemblies have not of late proved so <hi>harmonious</hi> as the state of Affairs required: which puts me in mind of what the Author of that ingenious <hi>Essay</hi> upon the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Third</hi> has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, <note place="margin">

               </q> The Fruits and Effects of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited <hi>Session,</hi> who were call'd to Parliament in <hi>Forty One,</hi> we cannot but with bleeding Hearts remember. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever respect they pretend to have for <hi>Parliaments,</hi> 'tis (as formerly) but to serve their own ends: for, (if they may have their own Will) according to the <hi>Project</hi> and Design laid in this <hi>Association,</hi> all <hi>Parliaments</hi> for the future (as they were once already in my own Memory) will be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced (without a <hi>King</hi> or <hi>a House of Lords)</hi> to a <hi>select Pack</hi> of well-flesh'd <hi>Rumpers,</hi> to do the <hi>Drudgery</hi> of their <hi>Army.</hi>

The <hi>Bill</hi> of <hi>Exclusion</hi> and <hi>Banishment</hi> is so unreasonable, and so <hi>absolutely</hi> unjust, that we cannot look upon't as <hi>a means of the King and Kingdoms Safety.</hi> And if the D. be of such a <hi>vindictive</hi> Spirit as they suggest, nay allow him but the <hi>Magnanimity</hi> that becomes his <hi>Highness,</hi> or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Resentments</hi> of <hi>Humanity,</hi> and the <hi>passing</hi> such a <hi>Bill</hi> had been so great and just a <hi>Provocation,</hi> it must needs have exposed the King's <hi>Person</hi> to great <hi>hazard,</hi> and the Kingdom to the lamentable Fate of a <hi>Civil War,</hi> if not an <hi>inevitable Invasion</hi> thereupon. And when we reflect upon the <hi>Rise</hi> and <hi>Progress</hi> of our late Confusions, (so black and dismal in the Event, and so fresh in Memory) all good men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be deeply sensible of his Majesties great Care and Princely Wisdom, in keeping us from the more dreadful Rage of such a <hi>Rupture</hi> as the restless Malice of ill men study to promote, whether for the Accomplishment of their own Ambition, or the setting up of their Darling <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas they say, <hi>They are persuaded in their Consciences, that the dangers they suggest are so eminent and pressing, that there ought to be no delay of the best means in their power, to secure the Kingdom against them:</hi> We comfort our selves, that they are no Prophets, (though 'tis no hard matter to fore-tell what they do project, if it be in their Power to effect it,) and that this is not the first time they have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted very ill things, (if not out of Malice, Ambition, and Design,) to make the best on't, upon the account of an <hi>erroneous</hi> Conscience.</p>
            <p>And whereas they say, <hi>They are intrusted to advise and act for the preservation of his Majesty and the Kingdom:</hi> We are satisfied, that they are no farther intrusted by the Laws and Loyal Commons of <hi>England,</hi> than may consist with their Duty and Allegiance; that is, no farther than the King shall please to require their Advice, and allow them to act by
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49204:14"/>
his Direction or Consent. Whereupon, the so much Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> commanded the <note place="margin">In the 35. of her Reign. 1592.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Consequently hereunto, though they call this <hi>Association the best means that are in their power to secure the Kingdom,</hi> we are well assured, that it is not in their Power at all when the King forbids it, and (as <note place="margin">Sed tantum pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumus quod jure possumus.</note> in Reason and Justice in this Case he may and ought) declares it a Design to subvert both his <hi>Prerogative</hi> and <hi>Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For to be plain with you, in this detestable Contrivance which is here recommended under the specious Title of an <hi>Association,</hi> every man of Sense may observe with half an Eye, what the Hypocrisie and Subtilty of those ill men have projected, <hi>to set up themselves,</hi> upon the Ruins of the <hi>Royal</hi> Family, the <hi>English</hi> Protestant Church and Nation. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To secure his Majesty's <hi>Sacred Person,</hi> they'll disband his <hi>Guards,</hi> and remove his Faithful <hi>Ministers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To preserve his <hi>Royal State</hi> and Dignity, they'll cut off the <hi>Succession,</hi> and banish his dear and only <hi>Brother</hi> out of his Dominions.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To support his <hi>Crown,</hi> they'll <hi>usurp</hi> the Government into their own hands, and turn it into a <hi>Military</hi> State of <hi>Safety.</hi>

4. For the Honour of their <hi>Country,</hi> they'll subvert that which (to all <hi>Loyal</hi> Subjects, and in the Estimation of all wise and sober persons) is the happiest <hi>Monarchy</hi> under Heaven.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That out <hi>Properties, Laws,</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> may be kept inviolable, they'll set up an <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> and some Regiments of <hi>Janizaries,</hi> to rule over us, and make us <hi>Slaves</hi> to our Fellow-Subjects.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To defend <hi>Religion,</hi> they'll not consult a Legal and Learned <hi>Convocation;</hi> but they'll lay aside the <hi>decent</hi> and <hi>distinctive</hi> Garment of the <hi>Minister,</hi> they'll take away the <hi>Cross</hi> in Baptism, that ancient <hi>Badge</hi> of Cathollck and Primitive Christianity; they'll abandon <hi>kneeling</hi> at the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> with all <hi>external Adoration;</hi> they'll turn the <hi>Reverend</hi> Bishops out of the House of Lords, and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal</hi> those <hi>Acts</hi> by which <hi>Uniformity</hi> in the Worship and Service of God, stands established; and so destroy (the <hi>Bulwark</hi> of the <hi>Reformation)</hi> the best Protestant Church in <hi>Christendom.</hi> All which Particulars, here enumerated, are the <hi>visible</hi> and <hi>avowed</hi> Designs of this <hi>Society</hi> and their <hi>Association.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To effect all this, they'll <hi>wrest</hi> the <hi>Sword</hi> out of the King's hands, and appoint <hi>Officers</hi> of their <hi>own,</hi> to <hi>levy, discipline,</hi> and <hi>conduct</hi> Forces (how far they'll be <hi>Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> we desire not to make experiment) without his <hi>Majesty</hi>'s Consent, and to pursue to <hi>Destruction</hi> all such as shall <hi>oppose</hi> them.</p>
            <p>And for all this, we have not only their Lives and Fortunes engaged, under their <hi>Hands</hi> and <hi>Seals;</hi> but
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49204:15"/>
their solemn <hi>Promise, Vow,</hi> and <hi>Protestation</hi> in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Almighty God.</p>
            <p>So that here is a <hi>Design</hi> and <hi>Train</hi> laid, to act over again the same <hi>Scene</hi> of <hi>Treason</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi> which has once already (and within our Memory) turn'd this our flourishing Kingdom into an <hi>Aceldama,</hi> and smothered the Glory of it in Confusion.</p>
            <p>An <hi>Association</hi> this is, so <hi>hypocritical</hi> in the <hi>Disguise,</hi> so <hi>devilish</hi> in the <hi>Design,</hi> and so <hi>destructive</hi> in the <hi>Tendency</hi> of it, That what <hi>Knights</hi> or <hi>Et Caetera</hi>'s soever they be, that pretend to give it Countenance (in the <hi>Front</hi> of it) we are sure it could no more be <hi>subscrib'd</hi> (or tendered to Subscription) by Subjects that have any <hi>Sense</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> of their <hi>Duty,</hi> than assented to by any <hi>Prince</hi> that has Regard to his own <hi>Prerogative,</hi> or the <hi>Welfare</hi> of his People and the Church of God.</p>
            <p>In a sad Resentment whereof, we find that all <hi>Loyal</hi> Subjects do humbly <hi>protest</hi> their utter <hi>Abhorrence</hi> of the said <hi>Association,</hi> with all other <hi>Plots, Designs,</hi> and <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices</hi> of the like Nature; and we see also, they resolve not only to <hi>deprecate</hi> them in their <hi>Litany,</hi> (wherein we beg Deliverance from all <hi>Sedition, Privy Conspiracy,</hi> and <hi>Rebellion)</hi> but also to engage their <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Fortunes</hi> under his <hi>Majesty</hi> and his Lawful <hi>Successors,</hi> to suppress them.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, as you observe, the pretences of <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> (for <hi>Religion, King,</hi> and <hi>Country)</hi> are too apt to gratifie the good meaning of some, and to impose upon the weakness of others. And I am not ignorant, that such
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49204:15"/>
               <hi>Insinuations</hi> have prevailed so far with many, as to make them ready to submit their Necks to the same Yoke which gall'd us formerly, and to become Slaves a second time to the Designs of <hi>Faction,</hi> and the Lusts of their Fellow-Subjects.</p>
            <p>But when a stupid <hi>Insatuation</hi> has prevailed with such <hi>easie</hi> men, to put on the like Chains with their own hands, we esteem it not the least of our happiness, that 'tis still in his <hi>Majesty</hi>'s Power to knock them off, and reprieve us from that Thraldom.</p>
            <p>I tell you not my own <hi>single</hi> Sense, but the Sense of all <hi>Loyal</hi> and <hi>Sober</hi> men, that being taught by so late Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that such as snatch at the <hi>Jewels</hi> of the Crown can never think themselves secure of that <hi>Booty,</hi> till our <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty</hi> becomes their Prey too, (as it was in the late <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> which began with an <hi>Association)</hi> we are highly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to his Majesties <hi>Fatherly</hi> Care and Tenderness, that he will not more suffer an <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> to insult over his Subjects <hi>Liberty</hi> than to invade his own <hi>Prerogative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Sense his Majesty is pleased to express of our sad Affliction or Bondage under the late <hi>Tyranny</hi> of <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical</hi> Reformers, gives us an assured Confidence, that so <hi>Divine</hi> a Clemency (as shines in him) can never delight to hear us groan under the like oppressions.</p>
            <p>And His <hi>Royal</hi> Word to secure us against the Attempts of it in <hi>others,</hi> as well as against the practice of it in his own <hi>Dispensations,</hi> is a <hi>Supersedeas</hi> to all our Doubts and Scruples upon that account.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:49204:16"/>
And having the same Security for the full Fruition of our <hi>Religion,</hi> in this Church established, (the most steady and inflexible <hi>Prop</hi> and <hi>Bulwark</hi> of the <hi>Throne,</hi> which therefore makes it no less his Majesties <hi>Interest</hi> than his <hi>Obligation</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> to support it) we cannot conceive it in any Danger unless betray'd by a <hi>Latitudinarian Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality,</hi> or our own froward <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Dissentions.</hi> And we should be secure enough in this point too if we could be timely awakened to consult our own Safety, and <hi>unanimously</hi> agree to make the known Laws the <hi>Standard</hi> of our <hi>Duty,</hi> as his Majesty has graciously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to make them the <hi>Rule</hi> of his own Government.</p>
            <p>After such Agonies as we have conflicted with through the neglect hereof, the concurrent Practise of this Rule would be the best Atonement of our Differences, and the Ensurance of our Concord. This would extinguish all our present <hi>Plots,</hi> and prevent the Emergency of the like <hi>Projects</hi> for the future; then the Kingdom would be set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in <hi>Peace,</hi> the Church in <hi>Order,</hi> and all sorts of men become <hi>conformable</hi> in a due Obedience. <hi>Succession</hi> would be no more disputed, the Government no more <hi>libell'd,</hi> Loyalty no more <hi>defam'd,</hi> nor the <hi>Dutiful</hi> persecuted by the Tongues or Pens of the <hi>Malicious,</hi> the Pillow of the Crown would be no longer stuff'd with <hi>Thorns,</hi> His Majesties <hi>Throne</hi> would become <hi>safe</hi> and <hi>easie,</hi> his <hi>Sword</hi> victorious, and his Royal <hi>Scepter</hi> had in Veneration.</p>
            <p>And seeing His Majesty has even prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our most early <hi>Addresses,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Peruse His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Gracious Declaration.</note> in professing  that to be his <hi>Royal</hi> Will and Resolution, which should have been our Prayer and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and having his <hi>Sacred</hi> Word (published in the
