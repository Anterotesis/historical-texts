         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I my Self was an Eye-Witness of many of his Fits, and there are others (not a few) yet alive about <hi>Walpoole</hi> and <hi>Cookly</hi> who can attest them; So as the matter of Fact hath c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cing Evidences, and is undeniable in the Substance of it.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>Atheistical</hi> and Irreligious Pers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ns in this Age, which would perswade us that all such matters are Cheats, or come only from a Natural Cause.</p>
            <p>If some be Cheats and Counterfeits, must all be so? Surely not. It is not imaginable that this should be a Cheat, for the dispensation was so Stupendous and Terrible, that no Man would Voluntarily have b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en biassed by Interest; or hired into such a Condition for such a number of Years whatever Worldly advantage could be laid before him.</p>
            <p>If some strange Convulsive Motions may be from a Natural Cause, yea even in this Person in part, yet it is Irrational to think that the Principal or chief of his unusual Fits should be reducible thereunto. Men might more probably say, that the sore Boils which <hi>Job</hi> was smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with were from a Natural distemper, and not from Satan, <hi>Job</hi> 2.7.</p>
            <p>Many of these Motions were beyond Mr. <hi>Spatchets</hi> skill (as his acting the part of a Drummer, a Musician) others were apparently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary, even against his own Life, others not only Morally, but Naturally impossible (without Super added strength) as far transcending his Natural power; which together with the speedy recovery (in a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or half an hour after the removal of the Fits) from such Torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wracking Pains by Violent Distorting of Limbs, sufficiently ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue its not proceeding meerly from a Natural bodily distemper.</p>
            <p>To this I might add what I my self and my Friend Mr. <hi>William Bidbank</hi> (a Minister) did observe in another Famous Case at <hi>Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoft</hi>; where divers persons (not only Dissenters but also others) had Torturing Fits, and raised or Vomited many Pins, all Wrankled and bent, so as I could not observe two Pins of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se which I saw that were bent in the same manner.</p>
            <p>Can any imagine that these Pins were from a Natural Cause, engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in their Bodys and thus bent? and when divers of them had Fit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s together at the same time, if one recovered and did but go and lay a hand upon the others, they would immediately recover, and be well again Surely these things may be enough to evince that these things were pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:64609:3"/>And those <hi>Lowstoft</hi> Witches had their Tryal before that Renowed, Cautious and Iudicious Iudge <hi>Hale,</hi> were found guilty and Executed, and afflicted persons freed, we hope as an answer of Prayer Solemnly made there on the accou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t of the persons before so sorely Visited.</p>
            <p>It remaineth then that if those things were not meerly from a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cause, then they must be Diabolical. And in the present instance of Mr. <hi>Spatchet,</hi> it is unquestionabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I would therefore Caution such as are Witch-Advocates to take heed of being incredulous, Mockers and Deriders at such things, lost the Lord leave them to find by sad Experience that there are such wicked Creatures in the World.</p>
            <p>If any should stumble at it, that such a good man as Mr. <hi>Spatcher,</hi> should suffer by the hands of Witches, such Children of the Devil.</p>
            <p>Let them know, that God, (for Wise ends) permitted Satan sorely to afflict his Servant <hi>Job</hi>; a man who had a Testimony from the mouth of God himself, <hi>Job</hi> 1.8 and 2.3.

            <p>YOU are very desirous to obtain a faithful Narrative (<hi>a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite ad Calcem</hi>) of these wonderful and almost unparallel'd Fits wherewith Mr. <hi>Thomas Spatchet</hi> was afflicted for some years: I here present it to your view, as a matter that deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to be had in remembrance in Ages to come.</p>
            <p>I have lived some Miles distant from the place of his abode; but yet co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing often thereabouts, I had the advantage to be an Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a great part of what you find in this Story, and more I had from his own mouth; for he was always free to declare how it wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> with him before many Witnesses.</p>
            <p>The various passages seemed to me so remarkable, as from time to time I could not but commit them writing, for a memorial of them; and I suppose some others have done the like, yea many (if they have not yet) might have done it; for this was no private business, but commonly known in this Country.</p>
            <p>I submit it to your Iudgment, whether all proceeded from a Natural Cause, or a Diabolical.</p>
            <p>He still findeth those shatterings in his head (within mentioned) in Religious Duties, at some times, especially if he travelleth beyond his strength.</p>
            <p>I shall add no more but this, that the wording of it is not all his, but partly mine, and therefore I must crave excuse for failures there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.

            <p>THE purpose and design of this Undertaking is, to give a faithful Narrative and true Relation, of the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and almost unparallel'd bodily Afflictions, which (of late years) <hi>an Eminent Servant of Christ</hi> hath been exercised with, by a variety of violent and torturing Fits, <hi>the History</hi> whereof may be admirably useful for the striking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and astonishment into the hearts of Sinners, and especially such who are of an Atheistical Spirit, hardly perswaded that there is either a God or a Devil, here they may read of both; <hi>and if this be done to the green Tree, what will be done to the dry?</hi> It may also serve for the <hi>Encouragement and Consolation of True Christians,</hi> who may be exercised in a like condition, and may labour under doubtings and despondency of spirit upon that account, crying o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But it may not be amiss to look back and touch upon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going part of his Life.</p>
            <p>His Name is Mr. <hi>Thomas Spatchet</hi>; he was born <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>
               <hi>The aforesaid Mr. Thomas Spatchet</hi> is one, whom the special Providence of God hath watched over for good, even from his Childhood.</p>
            <p>He had almost a miraculous preservation in his very Infancy; for, being then carried by a Servant carelesly upon her shoulders,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64609:4"/>
in a Yard set with Stone; she stumbling, he fell over her head, and <hi>pitched his head upon a Stone,</hi> whereby his Skull was broken, and the wound so deep and dangerous, that the mark is still ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent; there is a great seam to be seen on the left side of his Head, down towards the outside of his Eye, and the upper part of it turneth like a square about the midst of the sore-part of his Head; it seemeth to be two Inches or more both ways. But here the Lord had given his Angels such a charge concerning him, that altho' he dashed his head against a stone, yet he was preserved and kept from this threatned death, and delivered, that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the mighty Works of God.</p>
            <p>Afterward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> when he was <hi>between</hi> 21, <hi>and</hi> 22 <hi>years of Age</hi>; being in a married state, going to a Well (in the same Yard where he had the aforementioned fall) upon occasion to draw Water; the Pully and Bucket falling, he fell with them headlong into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Well, which was about 21 yards deep; the Water there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was at that time about knee deep; but the All-wise God so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected his fall, that he missed the bucket, the fatt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and great s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A Man going down, found him standing on his legs, and fetched him up; but when he came to the Air, he grew very ill, and kept his Bed many days after this his retirement into the Chambers of Death; he having been but a little while in the bowels of the Earth (that whilst he was alive he might have a foretast of the Grave) he hardly knew how to live in the common Air any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; but the Lord had intendments to make his Power known in his restoration; he had further work for him to do, and more for him to suffer; and therefore altho' the dreadful effects of this fall began now to shew themselves in a <hi>Vrin red like blood,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is not to be passed in silence, what mercy was mixt with this sad dispensation, that in this dangerous fall not one of his bones was broken; that hand that held the Rope lost some flesh, almost

to the bone, and he had a hole in his wrest, a range on the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and the skin beaten off his ankles, no other hurt outwardly appearing either in head or elsewhere, the skin not so much as broken, but as aforesaid.</p>
            <p>It also deserveth observation that a Woman in the same Town falling into a Well, was taken up alive, but soon died.</p>

               <hi>Chap.</hi> II. Of his Fits, their beginning and continuance for some time; Benumming, Shaking, Skipping.</head>
            <p>IT pleased the Lord after walking towards him in such a varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of merciful Providences, at last by his Spirit to bring him into a saving acquaintance with himself in his Son Jesus Christ, through the exceeding great and precious Promises of the Gospel; with what brightness the Grace of Christ hath shined forth in his conversation, to the refreshing the bowels of other Christians, is well known to those who have had the advantage to converse with him. For many years such a Gospel-conversation hath been found with him, as (tho' he hath infirmities common to all men and Christians, yet) men who have made the strictest observation thereof, and have pryed into it with the most curious Eye, could not descry any Apostacy or Backsliding; his steps have not visibly declined from the ways of God to this day; yet the Lord (whose ways are in the deep, which doth great things and unsearchable, marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous things without number <hi>Iob</hi> 5.9.) hath in those latter years shewed him great and sore troubles, led him in unwonted paths, which few have known, tryed him with a variety of strange<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if not unpresidented violent Fits, the rise, progress, &amp; end whereof so far as can be remembred) will be rehearsed in these following lines.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>About the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nth of March</hi> 1660. as he was speaking to some, he found a mutation or alteration in his head, causing such a failure either in the use of his understanding, memory or senses (call it what you will) as put him to a stand; he was at a loss, knew not how to go on in speaking what he intended to his friends, but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64609:5"/>
quickly recover'd again; and not long after (the same day) was at the same loss again, finding a grinding pain round about the crown of his head, near half way downward (as he hath done ever since upon such occasions) it was not violent, but moderate and easie to be born; this to his head hath been answerable to the jarring of the elbow by a blow; much differing always from the ordinary pain of the head, without belching.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here was the ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e of all the insuing Tribulations</hi>; from so small a beginning, hath sprung all those subsequent troubles which have been asto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ishing to the beholders.</p>
            <p>I might have noted (once for all) that since, the aforesaid pain ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h sometimes lasted two or three hours after he hath been well recovered out of those Fits.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, the next day after he was first taken (&amp; since) he was subject to the same distemper, to be at a loss upon speaking; yet went up and down that week, and when he did set about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious duties, as Prayer, he could go but a little way without faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring and failing therein.</p>
            <p>The same spring, he seemed to have inward nippings and smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings in his head, which caused a great amazement and astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in him, and hath continued in some degree long since, at times; and hath hindred a free and uninterrupted exercise of his understanding, or rather the use of speech; for it was not so much a failing in perception or apprehension of things, as inability for expression, he knew what he would say, and what others said or did, but could not utter it: he was disabled for proceeding at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in what he would say; so that it seemeth to be rather a fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of speech than of understanding.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Afterward it brake forth into Fits of two sorts or kinds.</hi>

               </gap>ime his head and other upper parts would stand still; after this one Leg would shake and no other part, and then his whole Body, Chair and all in Violent Motion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Before the shaking fits came, his hands would be lifted up,</hi> and cast down upon his knees, beating them for some time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Afterwards his leggs and feet would move</hi> with much agility and harmony, in fits striking upon the ground as if in ringing of Bells, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. without Changes, a great while together; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>as if in playing in Musick,</hi> diverse Musical Tunes, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing orderly stops, <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>inguish the Tunes if they be played on Musick Instruments; yet such as were with him in his Fitts, and knew the Tunes, were able by their hearing the beating of his Feet to discerne his acting the part of a Musician therein: His Feet would strike 7 or 8 times or oftener, one Foot first and than the other answering imediately after, except where the Tune requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have it otherwise, and in ringing, his Feet every st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oak had a several place of the ground, in its setting down.</p>
            <p>Also he hath by the beating of his Feet in his Fits, <hi>acted the part of a Drummer,</hi> Sounding a Call, a March, a Retreat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet he never did Drum, nor doth he know (if he heareth a Drum beat) how to distinguish those each from other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>After this, his whole Body hath been of ten in impetuous motion,</hi> his Hands and Feet flying about with great swif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ess, with such a variety of Motion as is unexpressible, till he hath sometimes fallen out of his Chair, and if he hath so fallen, although in the height of the Fit, yet it hath presently left him.</p>
            <p>At first he had but two or three of these fits in a day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then they came to Four in a day constantly, and so continued week by week, and month by month, and when Four in a day, than each of them were two Hours in a day, and sometimes he had half an hours respite between, at other times a quarter of an hour, and it m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y be one day in a Month or Five weeks without a Fit.</p>
            <p>Then they altered from 4 to 5 in a day, and than to 6 or 7 or 8,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64609:6"/>
and so on to 20 or more in a day, but then came to be shorter when more in number, yet in the same manner for actions as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid. After he comming to be tyred out with being in the Chair, he did lie down on a Bed, and rising to come off his Bed, both leggs would go sidewise or not at all, and then his whole Body raised up two Foot, Capering about in the Chamber, till he fell down, and then the fit left him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Also he had Skipping or Iumping Fits,</hi> wherein sometimes his Feet being close together his whole Body hath been lifted up, and his Feet from the ground (as hath been said) two Foot or more, sometimes right up &amp; down often at other times hath been lifted up and both his legs carried sidewise at a great distance as if he had jumped, and then back again as far sidewise, thus a great while together till his strength hath failed, and Spirits have been spent, all this time bearing himself upon a strong staff; If he hath been beaten against a Wall, or after his strength hath fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if a Chair hath been set behind him and he helped into it, then he hath rested there untill he hath been a little revived.</p>
            <p>Some <hi>Fits did begin first benumming him, than shaking, than skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and some of these have lasted 4 some 5, 6 or 7 hours from the beginning to the end, and as some part hath been playing or stamping, so the end hath been with great Violence.</p>
            <p>Thus his Fits continued many Months.</p>
            <p>In all these things there was occasion to Sing of Mercy and Judgment.</p>
            <p>Here is Judgment, not only upon the account of the Terrible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Fits themselves which rendered him an Object of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Compassion, to all who were Spectators of him therein, whose hearts were not harder than Flint, but also by an aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of this dispensation through <hi>a disablement for Religious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises which did attend it.</hi> For the first year he had some liberty to wait upon God in Prayer at some times, and could hear the word Preached, afterward could hear but one part of the day, then could hear the Prayer and part of the Sermon, and so by degrees could not hear at all.</p>
            <p>Within a year and half or thereabout (after his being first taken with the Fits) he lost his liberty for any such act of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; he could not attend upon God in any Religious Service<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This was such a dark dispensation, as put the Wisest men and those of greatest experience, and understanding in the ways of God to a stand, they were at a loss how to interpret these dealings of God with him; that a man whose heart was so deeply ingaged for God and his Services, should now be uncapable of rising up thereunto, or be hindred, <hi>not by a decree of Man, but by the Providence of God.</hi> That he who had been so many years under a new Birth yet should now be thus disabled for crying unto God, that he who had so much of the Spirit of adoption as a Spiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>zing to the beholders of it.</p>
            <p>But <hi>here was Mercy still,</hi> in that when no such Spiritual breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings might be discerned by slanders by, yet his Pulse was beating Heaven-ward, in inward workings and groanings of Spirit after God, and in that sedate quiet and chearful frame of Spirit, that was found with him under this stupendious dispensation, which manifested it self, when he had any intermission, that it may be said of him as of <hi>Iob</hi> of old, <hi>Iob,</hi> 1. v. 22. So <hi>in all this he sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</hi> I might here give some account of his Experience, but I shall defer that a little longer.</p>
            <p>There was Mercy not only in sustaining his Soul, but his body also; for so soon as the Fits were off, he could now eat his meat whether the fits were long or short.</p>
            <p>Also he had a partial <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Yet at some times (before Swingling) if he would force him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to stand still he could, but if he would go it must be those ways: stirring sometimes to go forward two or three steps, he should be forced as many more backward and sometimes his leggs crossed, thus he hath tryed half an hour together and could not get forward the breadth of a house, but giving liberty to himself then to go backward, he could go with great swiftness that way. Sometimes lifting up his foot to go streight on, his leg hath been lifted up a great height and must stand there, he could not get it down again whilst one might go near forty paces, this was but sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the other often.</p>
            <p>In <hi>the Winter</hi> 1693. <hi>then it came to a Continual shaking like a Palsy</hi> head and body, and not many violent Fits, but shaking all the day long, from the time of his rising, till night six or seven a Clock, and then went off with a sharp shaking Fit.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of the shaking he could neither eat nor drink, nor all the day long, till it was off at night about six a Clock; afterward he could eat, if he would walk up and down in the House eating. If he felt those nippings in his head, he must keep it in his Mouth untill the fear and amazement was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and then chew aud swallow it down, and thus by degrees he could eat a Supper; but if he ceased walking and sate down (as many times he did for tryal) by that time he had eaten 8 or 9 Morsels either he could not rise off the Seat he fate on, or could not speak, or else could not keep the Seat, by reason of Violent shaking, and thus it continued about 16 or 17 Weeks.</p>
            <p>Some that sympa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:64609:8"/>
was there a cessation of these Fits, as an Eminent return of Prayer.</p>
            <p>After that for the space of ten days he had a respite, an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission or breathing time, a little reviving in this Bondage, and then they came to their former course again, as to stamping, shak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and skipping in the usual manner, but not exceeding 8 Fits in a Week, whereas before he had 8 or 10 or 12 or more in a day; this was in the Summer time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Afterwards they ceased from shaking Fits, and came to Wringing Fits.</hi> His Hands lying one upon or in another would Wring one out of the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then the fore finger would rise up first, and so the rest one after another, till all met, <hi>viz.</hi> the Fore-finger of one hand with the fore-finger of the other hand, the Second finger of one hand with the second of the other, and so for the rest; at some times they would be spread abroad finger from finger of the same hand so wide as if one would have been rent from the other. When they were all met as aforesaid, then they would gradually by a slow motion be raised above the Crown of his hat, till his hands clasped both together fast about his Neck, and then were Immovable till they did of their own accord remove, and then they were wrung Backward, and the Palms of his hands turned upward at his Back, and then were carried by degrees under his Arm-holes till they met right behind, and were carried up to his Shoulders, with much Pain and so as a Crashing about the Joynts hath been heard by standers by; these Fits are so Terrible as he felt them a great while after, and doth to this Day: then they were brought back again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the one hand to his Mouth then to his Eye, and the other stretched out as if he had been shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Bow drawing it to the utmost; after tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Above half an hour would these Wringing Fits continue, and all that while no shaking.</p>
            <p>When his hands had done, then his head was wrung the one way, and his mouth the other contrary way, the former so far till he did see right behind him, and there stood a Considerable time; then his head would be turned the other way till he saw right behind, and his Mouth not so drawn, and thus backward and forward Five or Six times; after that his head would be still, and his Body wrung almost off the Chair, and then the Fit ceased. His Legs have some times been drawn under the Foot of the Chair, and there set fast for a Considerable time. Every Day he had one of these Fits.</p>
            <p>Some Christian Friends being deeply affected with his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, did betake themselves again to Prayer, where he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and was in all those Motions; in the time of Prayer he was put upon kneeling down, and did so for some time, and had (as he phraseth it) a Nip in his Head, whereupon he started up, and almost struck one down which stood by, yet the work of Prayer went on. He was then put upon bowing his Body (without pulling off his Hat) and moving his Hand like a great Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menter, also upon drawing as at a Bow, Skipping, Wringing, and such like, being set on a Chair, endeavoured to gather up his Legs (being turned sidewise) and his Head was Bowed backward, his Mouth strained wide open at such a distance as if his Jaws should have been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Before I pass on, I shall briefly hint what the frame of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, was <hi>as to matter of experience, under these terrible dispensations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was desirous to see friends, but it was a great trouble to him, that when they went about any Religious exercise he must go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and this hath so affected him as by the working of his a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections he hath been cast into fits.</p>
            <p>But the way which the Lord did ordinarily lead his heart in, was to be quiet under his hand, and to submit to his will patien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; leaving him to his own time for deliverance if he saw it good for him, and this he found when he was under the most violent fits: In his greatest extremity there was such a bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>edness to the Divine Will, as <hi>he could as willingly sit down in the Chai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to receive a fit from the hand of the Lord, as rise out of the Chair when it was off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the thoughts of that, did often encourage him in his fits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[Lord thou knowest when it is enough, and thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est when to make a cessation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I leave it unto thee.]</p>
            <p>And sometimes upon the account of <hi>Divine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rerogative</hi>; his heart hath been quieted: he may do wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h his Creatures what he pleaseth, and there hath been deserved infinitely more. Such hath been the mercy of God towards him, that for the most part his body was more tryed out, than his Spirit. Only twice he found a little working of discontent.</p>
            <p>Once he had some fear lest that quiet which he had, should
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64609:9"/>
be but a carnal quiet, through the carelesness of his own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</p>
            <p>It pleased the Lord presently to leave him to some discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Spirit about it, and at that time his Fits were not by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny degrees so high as formerly or since; this frame continued but a day and a night, and the next morning after the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced him of the evil of it, that he had been discontented with his hand, when he lay'd it so lightly upon him, in comparison of what he experienced formerly; he saw wisdom, goodness and mercy in God, even in leaving him to be discontented; the Lord turned this to his good and helped him against it, letting him see that contentment cometh from him; it is of the Lord to make a man contented in any Affliction: Content was the Lords and none of his, he could not quiet his own Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another time</hi> after he injoyed some respite from fits, and God had been often sought concerning it; he found a great unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to come under the yoke again; he considered the manner of the affliction, that God did strike at him in respect of his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that if he came near where he was worshiped, then he did strike with heavier stroaks than at other times; upon the return of his fits after some weeks respite, he had such workings of heart as these; the People of God generally sought the Lord, and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed Prayer, yea God himself excommunicated and shut him out, it was a dark dispensation.</p>
            <p>Immediately after these thoughts he had this as a quiet to his Spirit [wait on the Lord, and wait for God.] It is better to wait for God in the want of a mercy sometimes, than to injoy a mercy we desire; for while we are waiting upon God for mercy desired we are honouring of God, but while we injoy mercy desired God is honouring of us.</p>
            <p>And this Scripture came to his thought, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.3. <hi>The Vision is for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak wait for it</hi>— Vision is of dark things, these are to be waited for: His unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness now was removed, and his heart brought in some measure, to wait upon and for God, though it were a dark dispensation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God would give deliverance if he did see it good.</p>
            <p>He was wonderfully quieted and made willing to submit to the will of God; and unless these two times he hath not found such discontent and thus the Lord did help him over it, and his fits returned to their old course again.</p>

            <p>Then the Lord was sought unto in that case also, and that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry night he could eat 9 or 10 morsels, and the next day he could eat to satisfie his Appetite if he made haste; but as soon as he had done he fell into fits again of another kind, all parts of his body moved as if one limb would have been plucked from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, his hands in such swift motion as his fingers could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be discerned therein; and so his legs also, looking very gash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this lasted a fourtnight longer, every time that he did eat.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:64609:10"/>The Lord was sought unto for that also, and he was present till two Prayed, and had four of the Roaring Howling Fits; and from that Day; for the space of ten days he was free from the Shaking and other Fits. Then they came again like a <hi>Palsy</hi> for about 11 Days, then Skipping fits one in a Day, after that he had Roaring fits again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but with intermissions three or four Days, or a fourtnight.</p>
            <p>Also in the aforementioned Roaring fits, as he lay on his Back on the Bed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Hands and Legs were drawn right upward one Leg against one Arm and Hand, and the other Leg against the other Arm and Hand, and so stood right up for some time, then they would fall down and be raised up again in the same manner, three or four times in a fit, his fingers being stretched so wide as if they would have Parted and been Rent one from another; and at one time when his Hands and Legs were so stretched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, at the same time his Body was lifted up from the Bed three or four times, and falling down again upon the Bed, he was acted thus up and down without his putting forth any Natural Power to promote such a Raising up of his Body from the Bed.</p>

               </gap>ad gone the length of one Close or Field, he was struck Dumb, and hath remained so all the day, being necessitated to return back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to his house, where he could either sit or walk butwas speech<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>less; these would go off and speech return ordinarily (yet not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways) without any violent motion; these were not every day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>In some part of the time he had a moderate shaking like a Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, all the day long, from the time of his rising till a quarter of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:64609:13"/>
and then he could speak; If he leaned his head against any thing, then immediately his speech was gone, nor could he move his head from the place; nor raise himself on the seat whereon he sate, till it was pulled away, or they did give him Tobacco; and then it would go into outward shaking again,</p>
            <p>He had the use of his senses in this time, knew what they about him said and did.</p>
            <p>In <hi>those years</hi> 1665 <hi>and</hi> 1666 <hi>he had Roaring Fits,</hi> his mouth being stretched open, and such violent Fits, and those which hindred travel were superadded.</p>
            <p>Sometimes he had liberty to walk in the house or yards, but if he attempted to go into the Field, then before coming half way in it, his feet would be as if they were nailed to the ground; that by all means he could use, he could not remove them thence for a considerable time, nor get any further to any Friends house that he intended to go unto; he finding this coming, was necessitated timely to turn himself, and then could sholving remove one foot first about an Inch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and must stand there till one might have gone a quarter or half<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> way in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he Close, and then could remove the other foot an Inch, and so each removal at such a distance of time, if it were plain ground it was the better, but it was very tedious to him to ascend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or go up when he came at a Hill or Ascent.</p>
            <p>And thus he must move home again if none brought a Chair to him to sit down in till he revived; these Fits went off without shaking or other violent motion, and he remained in the former posture, till he attempted to travel again.</p>
            <p>In some of those fits resting, sometimes on a suddain one leg would be forced over the other the full reach, and so he must stand cross legged; but by degrees with great trouble it would be gotten back again to the other foot and with much difficulty get over it, which done, presently even the same instant, the other foot was struck cross the full reach also, and must stand till by degrees that also was gathered up and then he stood in the old posture, as if fastned to the ground; on a suddain he should have liberty to go as far as from one side of the house to the other, and then his feet were fixed to the ground again; after that he had a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to go a few steps further, then at the same pass again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till at last he did get into the house.</p>

               <hi>After these fits</hi> ceased, if he attempted to travel, he should soon <hi>be buckled, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Sometimes two men have been present when he has been in these Fits, and they fearing he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>About two years before the Violent Fits left him, he had some respite from Fits for several Days before he began with Physick, and the first Day wherein he took it he had a Fit, and so one Fit every Day that he was taking, till it came t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>One Professing Physick, observed him in his Fits, and conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it was no ordinary Contraction of Nerves, but a continual Motion sometimes of all parts, Arms, Hands, Legs, Feet, first stamping his feet, beating upon the ground very swiftly and strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, at a great distance each from other; his Arms at the same time flying out with a swift and Violent Motion, inward and outward all at once as fast as may be, for a considerable time to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, till at last the Fit went off, leaving him sometimes stret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>HIS Violent Fits continued until the <hi>Thirteenth Day</hi> of the Month of <hi>Febru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and from that Day he hath been freed from them, which was about 8 weeks before the Death of that Woman which Confessed her self to be a Witch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for she Dyed about <hi>April,</hi> 1667. before this 8 Weeks she was under Tortures from the Devil, and whether she had no leisure to send to and Afflict him, or whether it were only from God, laying a restraint upon that grand Enemy of Mankind Satan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he injoyed this Eight Weeks freedom from those Fits, must be left to others to Judge: it is good to ascribe all to God; but it being thus long before her Death, this argueth that it was no Corroboration of his Imagination by her Death that was the Cause of his freedom.</p>
            <p>Indeed, he had not a freedom from all Fits so early, he was under a Restraint from Travel until the very time of Her Death.</p>
            <p>About a Week before she Dyed, <hi>Mr. R.</hi> (a Conformist) sent for him to go to her, when she was Ill; he went about a Close length, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, if it had been upon his Life, he could not get one step further forward; he indeavoured very earnestly to go on but could not; he did get back again in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> long time and with much difficulty; and was forced to make many Courtesies (like Women) all the way back again, with many other like actions which were unavoidable.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>R.</hi> Went to her without him, and came to Mr. <hi>Spat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet</hi> saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he never saw such a Spectacle: for all the Skin of her Hands and Arms was scratched or torn off, hardly one place appeared whole as big as his Finger.</p>
            <p>She would not Confess to him any thing of Witchery, but only this; <hi>That She had made an agreement with the Devil, and it was now too late for Her to Repent</hi>; for she was Damned, or to this Effect she spake.</p>
            <p>She had two Cudgels lay on her Bed, and he asked her what she did with those.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:64609:17"/>She answerd, she had them there to Fight with the Devil, he did so misuse her.</p>
            <p>She was there alone, and he dragged her out of the Bed, and under the Bed: they below, hearing such a Noise, and knowing there was no Body with her, they went up and she was Bloody; she Confessed to them it was the Devil that came to her. So she Dyed near the time called <hi>Easter,</hi> 1667.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Spatchet</hi> was under restraint for travel at the time of her Death, and possessed with some fear that he should so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue until his Death, because he was so at her Death, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done to her to bring her to Justice. He had not any Imagination that he should then have freedom, but rather limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Holy One of <hi>Israel</hi> by thinking the contrary.</p>
            <p>Also she had said to some persons before her Death, that if she Dyed, yet Mr. <hi>Spatchet</hi> should not be fully Free, for others had him in hand as well as she.</p>
            <p>But yet the same Week that she Dyed, and the next time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when he attempted to visit Friends, he found a liberty for Travel; and hath injoyed that freedom ever since, <hi>viz.</hi> for the space of above two Years.</p>
            <p>Thus Gods thoughts were not as his thoughts, Divine Mercies did surpass his Faith.</p>
            <p>And yet the Lord would have it known to be his Work; his will was the determining rule how far deliverance should be afforded; it was not all at once but gradually, for although he had then a freedom from Violent Fits, and such as hindred travel; Yet, <hi>immediately after the Death of that Woman</hi> he had <hi>no Liberty for Religious Exercises,</hi> either to perform them himself, or to joyn with others therein: he remained without that freedom until the latter end of the <hi>September</hi> following, (which was almost half a Year) and then only <hi>Mentally; he tryed</hi> after her Death (as well as often before) <hi>Vocally to Pray,</hi> and <hi>could not,</hi> either alone or with others; but <hi>at the end of September,</hi> 1667. he could Mentally Pray a quarter of an hour together or more daily, with Invention as clear, and Affection raised as high as ever before he had Fits; and he had no disturbance.</p>
            <p>And because he found such a freedom that way, after some time he would try to express it, and when he did so, though he did it with a whispering Voice, yet he had not spoken usually
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64609:17"/>
Twenty words before he found a shattering in his head, so as he was utterly disabled for Invention of Expression, and for a time could not rise up from his Knees, in case he were Kneeling.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>After this he</hi> would Pray Mentally, and still before the ending would try to utter words, but found it as before, lost his speech and Invention, and reeled and staggered about the Room, yet even when he was worst of all this way, he knew how it was with him.</p>
            <p>Thus he continued until the first Day of the Month of <hi>Ianu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> following, when meeting with a rebuke; one blaming him for what was his Duty, and reflecting that as the cause of his great Affliction; though probably there was not any other cause than Divine Soveraignty for Tryals sake.</p>
            <p>And as if the Lord would witness against such undue reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon this Holy Man; he returning home, the Lord was pleased that very Night (after he met with that rebuke) to give him a Liberty by himself Vocally to Pray; he had tryed the Morning before and could not.</p>
            <p>But it was only by himself, he could Pray before others, but if they desired it, and he did adventure; then that very night after he had Prayed before others, he lost his Liberty of Praying by himself, and had no Liberty that way nor with others for the space of a Week.</p>
            <p>And then at the Weeks end he had Liberty again Vocally by himself, and so continued till he did Pray again with others, and if it were but with one on a sick Bed, or with more, it was all a Case, he lost his Liberty by it for a Week or a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night as before.</p>
            <p>Thus he continued until <hi>November</hi> 5 1668<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that very Night he had a Liberty to hear one Pray; although he had tryed the Lords Day before to hear a Sermon repeated, and could not, yet now he could.</p>
            <p>And the same Person that was the last he had Liberty to Pray with, before his Fits disabled him, was the First that he had Liberty to Pray with, when his Fits le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t him: and at the same Persons House was his First Liberty to hear one Pray, and also to Pray before others, and not lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e the Liberty his self.</p>
            <p>The next Day he Prayed in the Family, and did not lose his Liberty by it then, nor at any time since.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:64609:18"/>Only, if his head faileth by hearing others exercise, then sometimes he loseth his liberty of praying by himself or with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers exactly for a week, and then it returneth again.</p>
            <p>He findeth less liberty to hear others exercise than to pray himself. He can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ear a a Sermon if he doth not hear the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er before, and sometimes can hear both Sermon and Prayer, but that is seldom.</p>
            <p>In case he adventureth, usually he findeth a great distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, disturbance and shattering in his head, which unfitteth him for any service till it be over; it is sometimes procured not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Religious, but other actings, as he hath attempted often to ride on horse-back since his freedom from Fits, but ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>not: Even in the month called <hi>May</hi> 1669. He tryed, but he found that he lost all his strength, could neither go, stand, nor speak, nor so much as hold a stick in his hand; but was in a confusion, his head much disturbed by the motion of the horse, yet had a knowledge of all things done or said at this time.</p>
            <p>And it is to be noted, that since his Fits have left him, he findeth no alteration in his body, as to working of humours any other ways more than formerly when he was under Fits or before: Only findeth some decay of strength by reason of Age, yet he hath more strength now than he had in the time of his Fits.</p>
            <p>And this is the true account of his Condition both formerly <hi>and at present</hi> 1669. Whereby it may be seen that he injoyeth a wonderful Salvation from the Lord, which all that have waited upon God in prayer on his behalf, are to own him in, although (it be but partial not total.) There be some remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of bodily distempers, yet there is great cause to sing forth the high praises of God in all the Assemblies of the Saints, and to say, What hath God wrought?</p>
            <p>It is a mercy that hath been waited for, prayed for, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved for, by many Christians, and now the Lord expecteth the tribute of praises.</p>
            <p>As for Mr. <hi>Spatchet</hi> himself, he is desirous to glorifie God by offering up praises to him.</p>
            <p>Whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he had been many weeks under great tossings formerly, so as it was a rare thing in six or seven weeks to have one days

intermission, yet when he had that short breathing, he was quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and did not so much make account of liberty, as earnestly beg of God a preparation of heart for what was behind; and so when he had ten days, or a fortnight, or a months liberty, the Lord did then put him upon begging a submissive frame of heart for what was yet coming.</p>
            <p>Whereas since the death of that Woman, and his freedom that did insue, he is less begging submission, but more praising God for what he hath afforded, and begging an improving Spirit of that freedom.</p>
            <p>It is true, he had not an absolute and firm perswasion of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance before it came, but at some times was not without Faith about it, yet submitting it to the Divine Will. That Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was a wonderful stay to his heart, and a great incourag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Indeed it was gradually and not all at once; thus of old, the Lord said to the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> concerning the <hi>Canaanite</hi> and the <hi>Hittite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Exod.</hi> 23. <hi>v.</hi> 29.
