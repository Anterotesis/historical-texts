         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

wee haue from the sixteene verse
vnto the twentie and two verse:
The occasion of this walking was,
that these whom he had fedde with
loaues, did goe about to take him
by force,<note place="margin">V. 15.</note> for <hi>to make him a King:</hi>
He for to be quite of them; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
himselfe into a mountaine

the disciples entered into a ship,
and went over that sea towards
Capernaum; Jesus being behind:
But while after they had sailed fiue
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19909:8"/>
and twentie, or thirtie furlongs,
Jesus overtooke them, and entered
into their ship,<note place="margin">V. 21.</note> and <hi>immediatly the
ship was at the land whether they went;</hi>
this is vnto verse 22:</p>
               <p>Jn the third part is set downe
how those men whom he had fedde,
followed him over the sea towards
Capernaum, and what conference
the LORD had with them, after
they came to him.</p>
               <p>So soone as they came to him,
they vttered many faire wordes,

and for what they <hi>should labour.</hi>

               <p>* J am assured that Christ never

Though at the beginning,
while CHRIST preached vpon my

* There is not a preaching preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but some gracious pickle falleth
vpon some heart,<note place="margin">Note.</note> lyke well prepared

is like sowing, when the sower hath
put his sheete about his necke, he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
the seed from him, not thinking
that every pickle that commeth' out
of his hand shall take root: No not:
Some fall vpon <hi>stones,</hi> some vpon the

singeth for joy while he reapeth the

as GOD for the loue of one would

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19909:15"/>
for the loue of one, though in all his

him cast his seede of instruction, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke

               </p>
               <p>Now let vs consider well his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
in the verse which we haue red.
Heere first he letteth them see, what
they should not doe, secondly what
they should doe: <hi>Labour not for meat
that perisheth, but laboour for the meat
that will endure &amp; feed your souls to lyfe
eternal.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> * As if he should haue said, if

yee will neglect the <hi>soules food,</hi>
and therefore my counsell is that yee

                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:19909:16"/>
The doctrine is this,<note place="margin">Note.</note> It is not

wee can not desire the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
till the earth seeme vile vnto
vs. The heart of man will die if
it bee cloven or halfed. Jf one
serue two masters, one of the two
shall bee displeased; wee can not
with our eyes behold the Heavens
and the earth together: wee can
not looke to the east with the one
eye, and to the west with the other
at one tyme: wee are not able to
think that wee are into two places
together.<note place="margin">Note.</note> * Two severall thoughts

God that made the world before

               <p>* A man may try the trueth of

As a man is exercised in the

is, a labour that letteth not a man
sleepe, but night and day taketh

while he lyeth downe at even, the
world is in his mind, the last of all

say, what needed CHRIST to teach
those men, not to labour for their

followed him for to eschue labour:

they followed CHRIST for bread,
because they came easily by it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any labour: It might seeme that
CHRIST should rather haue said,
yee are but idle sluggards following

the mind: A carking care, an earnest

There bee many idle men who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
more for the meate which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth,
then these labourers, that in
most painefull labour winne their
bread with the sweat of their browes:
But how can that bee?</p>
               <p>The reason is, an ydle man may bee
a covetous man:<note place="margin">Note.</note> The greedy desire
of his heart to haue that which hee
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19909:22"/>
wanteth, is the labour that is heere
forbidden by the LORD: There bee
none so busie at this <hi>forbidden labour,</hi>
as some who are <hi>stark idle:</hi> They
abstaine from the lawfull labour of
the body, while their mindes vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
labour with laborious desires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
things which perish.<note place="margin">Note.</note> * Thus as
hee who beeing his alone, said, that
<hi>hee was never lesse his alone, than when
hee was alone,</hi> so may I say of such
idle drones, <hi>they labour not so much,
as when they labour none:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> * Many
while they are most idle, they are
least idle, for while their body is
idle, they labour with ill desires.</p>
               <p>Let vs in the words of my text
obserue the wisedome of CHRIST:
The auditours of his Sermon, were
men addicted vnto their belly, to
filthy <hi>panch pleasures:</hi> Behold heere
according as hee saw their sinne, he
fitted his reproofe, discharging them
to bee so carefull for perishing
things.<note place="margin">Note.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Thus as yee see by nature we are
but vile and abhominable bodies:
Let vs consider our selues to day:
Let vs view our <hi>predominant</hi> sinnes
with all their <hi>Dominions,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> even the

let vs seeke out our sores from the

guests for to sit downe at the King
of HEAVEN his table.</p>
               <p>Another doctrine I obserue heere
concerning those men who followed
CHRIST for loaues:<note place="margin">The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> This is it;
* Seeing such a number ranne after
CHRIST,<note place="margin">Note.</note> an abject man in the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19909:24"/>
world, and that but for loaues, what
would they haue done to another
for dainties and delicate cheere?</p>
               <p>* See how a loafe will make a
<hi>belly-god</hi> to follow after a man like
a dogge:<note place="margin">Note.</note> If the giver haue but a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
benefite of the worth of a
loafe, hee needeth no more to a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
man but a hisse. Seeing such
men will thus follow for loanes,
what would they doe for Kingdomes?</p>
               <p>* Satan thought that CHRIST had
beene a man come to seeke himselfe
in the world,<note place="margin">Note:</note> and therefore for to
allure him to come to his service,
hee offered him <hi>all the kingdomes of
the world:</hi> But CHRIST who knew
<hi>what hee had in Heaven,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 4. 9.</note> chased Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
away with all his earthly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</p>
               <p>* The vse of this Doctrine is,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that we
follow the LORD for nothing so much
as for himselfe:<note place="margin">The vse.</note> Indeede all his benefits
should allure vs to followe him, but
<hi>the maine cause</hi> of our followeing
should bee himselfe;<note place="margin">Note.</note> * <hi>I am that
I am</hi> should bee followed,<note place="margin">Exod. 3. 14.</note> for that
which hee is.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:19909:24"/>
In their followeing Christ for
loaues,<note place="margin">The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> for which they were reproued,
I gather a Doctrine of greate reproofe
for <hi>Scotland;</hi> While wee heare of those
men that followed Christ onely
for loaues; like Dogges, followeing a
man for bread, yee thinke not well
of them, and indeede they are branded
heere with a shamefull reproch, that
they followed the Lord more for
bread than for himselfe.</p>
               <p>But what if wee find more matter
of shame in <hi>Scotland</hi> than was in
<hi>Capernaum.</hi> Those that came to
<hi>Capernaum</hi> followed the Lord, because
he gaue to them aboundance of bread:<note place="margin">Note.</note>
* <hi>Scotland</hi> hath runne a way from
the Lord because hee hath giuen to
them aboundance of bread: diuerse
called his blessings <hi>the plague of plentie</hi>
the whole land gruged at the graces
of God: many not onely gaue not
thankes to the Father of mercies, but
cried that hee would curse <hi>their
mother the earth:</hi> that henceforth
she should become <hi>barren.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> * Wee
haue dishonoured God our Father, we
haue cursed our Mother in this Land,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:19909:25"/>
and all this was because God had
multiplied our loaues:<note place="margin">Note.</note> * In this wee
are worse than those of Capernaum:
for aboundance of meat made them to
follow after Christ, but aboundance
of meate hath made vs to runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from Christ: Except that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
wee repent vs of this Sinne the
Lord either by another Famine more
fearefull then ever we did feele, or by
some forraine warre shall so depriue
vs of our plentie, and scourge vs
with such a scarcitie which shall
make all the eares of EVROPE
to tingle.</p>
               <p>Are there any Mothers in this land
more tender hearted than were the
mothers of Israel, the daughters of
Sarah? Yet some of them in their
hunger, did eate their owne Children:
* The little ones came to their
mother,<note place="margin">Note.</note> with a pitifull voice, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Where is breade and drinke?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lam. 2. 12.</note> and
after swoned and than died: That
done the tender hearted mothers, did
eate the tender flesh of their yong
Children, which they nourished on
their breasts:<note place="margin">Note.</note> * That which they
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19909:25"/>
before had fedde nine moueth into
their bellys, they put into their mouths
and stomacks for the feeding of their
bellyes;<note place="margin">Note.</note> * Yea the mother which
for the distresse of Famine, had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with child, tooke vp the child
that was <hi>of a spanne long</hi> which she
did eate in her great distresse:<note place="margin">Lam. 2. 20.</note>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> * O
what a scarcitie behoved this to bee
which made the naturall mother,
so farre to passe the bounds of nature,
and all for a <hi>spanne long of flesh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This moued leremie the man that

               </p>
               <p>Because wee haue not seene such
afflictions, wee thinke that such can
not bee, neither haue beene, but that
the lamentations of God his Booke
are but <hi>fained Tragedies,</hi> or <hi>painted

               <q>The meate which perisheth:</q>
               <p>LET vs now take good heed how
the Lord heere calleth all this
worlds cheare, hee calleth it <hi>the meate
which perisheth:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> * Christ speaking
of all the meat that entereth in at the
mouth, that it passeth out againe,
<gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Take heed then, All this meat which
we eate is said by Christ, to goe to
the draught a place of secret filthinesse:
In this place of my text it is called
<hi>the meat which perisheth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let vs dwell a space vpon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of those wordes. The meat
for the belly which is said heere to
perish,<note place="margin">Note.</note> perisheth many wayes. * First
it perisheth, even in the pleasure &amp;
delectable taste thereof: Be it bee past
the throate, the taste is away, and
leaveth nothing behind it, but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate
that it would not continue:
* Some knowing the shortnes of their<note place="margin">Note.</note>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:19909:26"/>
throate, sup the strong drinke, and roll
the sweet morsell vpon their tongue;
for by this meanes to make the
perishing meat eternall: And yet
man can not attaine to that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
hee would be: All his wiles faile
him, and doe what hee can, he find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it to bee <hi>meat which perisheth:</hi>
Though his throat were a mile long,
at last <hi>peribit,</hi> it shall passe thorow:
Last of all the greater man his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
was in tasting, after the tast is
past, the greater sorrowe doeth ensue:
* This is that which maketh men
to come more sadde from bankets
than when they goe to them:<note place="margin">Note.</note> They
are more rejoyced with the hope
of a promised pleasure, than with
the pleasure it selfe: Many are more
glad before they come to the house
of feasting in hope of good cheere,
then when they are at table enjoying
that which they hoped, because
neither find they such pleasure as they
looked for, and though they found
more, yet this is their sorrow; all this
pleasure will last but for a short space,
the dinner with man his appetite not
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19909:27"/>
beeing able to last so long as an houre.</p>
               <p>* What shall I say then?<note place="margin">Note.</note> All such
pleasure are as <hi>Moses</hi> called our
life, viz.<note place="margin">psal. 90. 9</note>

               </p>
               <p>* The vse of this doctrine is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold:
first,<note place="margin">The vse.</note> seeing all things below are
so transitorie, let vs not with cark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
care conquesse the things that will
not abide with vs: Why should we
toile too much for to seeke those
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:19909:30"/>
things which nill wee, will wee, shall
perish? let vs not be too earnest to
seeke any worldly thing which wee
want, seeing after that we haue gotten
it, it will not abide in vs: ye would
thinke him a foole that would goe
gather water in a sieue, or fathome
the wind: Though wee could grippe
the Heavens, and have the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the two great iewelles of
HEAVEN, <hi>the Sunne and Moone,</hi>
What should wee haue but things
that should perish?<note place="margin">Psal. 102. 26.</note> They shall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.</p>
               <p>Secondly as wee should not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
too earnestly to conquesse any
worldly thing,<note place="margin">The vse.</note> neither should we be
too carefull to keepe any thing, which
either wee or others for vs haue
conquessed:<note place="margin">Note.</note> * Let men doe their
honest duetie, but let them not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
for to keepe that which hath
<hi>Wings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* I compare all worldly things
in mens hands to a <hi>Wild Sparrowe</hi>
put into a Child his hand:<note place="margin">Note.</note> Hee will
hold it by the wing, and whiles by
the foot, and whiles by the neb: But
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19909:30"/>
in the meanetime while hee is least
aware, it flieth out of his hand and
for all the <hi>annuell of his pleasures,</hi> yea
both for stocke and brocke, hee hath
nothing left but a regrate of losse.<note place="margin">Note.</note>
               </p>
               <p>* So long as worldly thinges are
<hi>stobfeathered,</hi> and haue as wee say
but the <hi>padocke haire,</hi> they will lye
still into our hands, for a space they
will tarie with vs; But tarrie a little
till their feathers bee growne and
they shall take themselves to their
flight:<note place="margin">Note.</note> * Some are more prime run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
away with the Tewcheit or
lapwing so soone as they are hatched:
They leaue not so much behind them
as the shell wherein they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained:
When the foolish man think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to find a full nest, all the birds
of his hope are away, and not so
much as the <hi>shell of appearance</hi> left
behind.</p>
               <p>* Mercifull God what a stupiditie
is this?<note place="margin">Note.</note> wee see this dayly, and yet
wee can not considder: wee see others
make such losse, wee see all sorts
of things <hi>perire,</hi> to perish, and passe
thorow, and yet wee think that what
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:19909:31"/>
wee haue, shall for ever tarrie with

This folie is seene in a greater matter

Now I exhort you in the name of
IESUS, that this whole day ye care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and painefully, labour in the
preparation of your hearts, that to

at the table of your LORD: Labour
this day I intreat you to search out all
your sins of thoughts, words, &amp; works,
whereof yee are guiltie since yee can
remember:<note place="margin">Note.</note> * Labour to search what
good or ill intentions yee haue for

GOD his worke, and woe to him
that shall doe it <hi>negligently.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* Wee must first then labour for
to trye out our sinnes,<note place="margin">Note.</note> after that we
haue found them out, wee must
mourne for them, wee must confesse
them, abhorre them, detest them, and
wrestle with GOD in prayer, till
hee seale vp the pardon thereof into
our hearts:<note place="margin">Note.</note> * Wee must in this our

vs all the old clouts and ragges of
our sinnes, and to put on vs, all our
spirituall jewels, that therewith bee-beeing

King.</p>
               <p>* Brethren and Sisters, I intreat
you to considder, that this day of
our preparation, must be a day of
painefull labouring with God for
his favour, for the sanctifieng of our
soules, that worthily wee may come
to that royall feast: seeing CHRIST
and his ANGELS will bee at the
table, for to behold and considder
vs to morrowe, wee must this day
carefully wash, deck, and trimme our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
that wee may be pleasant in
their presence, where such <hi>heavenly
eyes</hi> shall behold us.</p>
               <p>All this day must bee spent in such
labour. * If idlely we neglect this
duetie, wee haue to feare a more
painefull labour, viz. <hi>laborare morbo</hi>
the hard labour of God his wrath
and of many painfull and fearefull
diseases; yea, and death it selfe:
For this cause,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 30.</note> saith the Apostle,
<hi>Many are weake and sickly amongst

            <p>It shall therefore bee our wisdome,

            <p>I reade that in the dayes of Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,
a number of the people which

It is said that Hezekiah prayed for

Sermon was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into a <hi>Fast</hi> and
a <hi>Feast:</hi> First heere is
a Fast, and then a Feast:
The fast is from car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
care, <hi>Labour not for the meate
which perisheth:</hi> Fast from that: The
feast is for the soule, a banket of meate
which <hi>feedeth to life everlasting;</hi> Feast
vpon that: Take paines and labour
for it.</p>
               <p>This whole TEXT seemeth to
runne vpon a Sabbath of rest, and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
fore working and labour.</p>
               <p>The first part is a Sabbath and
rest from labours, <hi>Labour not for the
meate which perisheth:</hi> The second
hath a commandement of worke,
<hi>Labour for the meate which endureth
to lyfe everlasting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for GOD his Sabbath which is
a discharge of labour, a resting from
toiling, I read in Scriptures of three
sortes therof.</p>
               <p>First there is one on earth enjoyned
by GOD his law, a day of rest: <hi>In it,</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:19909:38"/>
(saith GOD,) <hi>thou shalt doe no
manner of worke:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 20. 10.</note> This is the <hi>lawes
Sabbath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second is the Gospel Sabbath,
which is a continuall resting from
carking cares: This is enjoyned heere,
<hi>labour not for the meate,</hi> &amp;c. This
precept is for our whole lifetime:
* There is not one day of the weeke
that GOD will dispense with any for
to labour in this sort.<note place="margin">Note.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The third Sabbath is in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
an eternall rest from all worldly
toiling, and sweat of browes, the
paines of sinne: of all that are there,
is said that they are <hi>blessed:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reval. 14. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>yea
saith the spirit for thy rest from their
labours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As there bee three sortes of rest,
first of the law, secondly of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
Thirdly of the HEAVENS, so
there bee three sortes of labour: first
there is one enioyned by the law,
a labour laide vpon all the sonnes
of Adam; to them it is enioyned sixe
dayes in the weeke to winne their
meat with the sweat of their browes:
* <hi>Cursed is that meat,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                  <hi>which is not
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:19909:39"/>
sawsed with sweete:</hi> Bitter is that
bread which is not sweetned with
the sweete of browes.</p>
               <p>The Second labour is, Gospell la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
a continuall labour. <hi>Labour for the
meat which endureth:</hi> This is enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the second part of this Text:
This is our spirituall exercise painfull
to flesh and blood in the best.</p>
               <p>The third labour, is Heauenly,
which shall bee our exercise in the
life to come:<note place="margin">Note.</note> * That labour shall bee
<hi>sweete without sweate, pleasant with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
paine:</hi> This labour is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
praising of GOD without
ceasing, which is so easy and so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
to the praisers that Scripture
calleth it a <hi>resting from our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is of the second sorte of labour,
whereof wee haue heere the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:
it is an</hi> Evangelicall labour
<hi>which is heere commanded by the

               <p>In these wordes, I perceiue three
chiefe things to bee considered, 1. for
what wee should chiefely labour,
viz. for the meate which endureth
to everlasting life. 2. who is the

of man, in these wordes <hi>which the
sonne of man shall giue vnto you.</hi> 3.

               <head type="sub">For what wee should chiefly labour.</head>
               <p>FIRST of all let vs consider for
what wee are commanded heere
to labour, <hi>labour</hi> (saith CHRIST,)
<hi>for the meate which endureth, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First obserue heere the wisedome
of CHRIST, secondly the corruption
of our nature.</p>
               <p>In this appeareth heere the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of CHRIST,<note place="margin">The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> in that after hee
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:19909:40"/>
hath discharged men to labour for
that which is not worthy their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
hee clearly letteth them see for
what aboue all things they should
labour: This is wisedome first to
take ill away, and then to put good
into the place thereof. CHRIST first
heere taketh ill out of the way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee bring in that which is good:
Hee dischargeth <hi>toiling for worldly
thinges,</hi> before hee speake of <hi>spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
labour:</hi> A wise man will not
sowe amongst thornes: Worldly cares
are but thornes.<note place="margin">Note.</note> * CHRIST heere
with <hi>labour not,</hi> as with a <hi>pruning
knife,</hi> sneddeth away such pricking
briers; that done, he commeth to the
maine point, declaring for what all
men should labour, this is wisedome.</p>
               <p>The vse: Let vs learne wisedome,<note place="margin">The vse.</note>
whether wee bee Teachers or Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
let this ever bee our first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to take first evill out of the
way: The weeds must bee first roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
before wee sowe good seede.</p>
               <p>* Before the goodnesse of CHRIST
can dwell into vs,<note place="margin">Note.</note> there must first
bee a <hi>preparation of the way in the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:19909:40"/>
wildernesse</hi> of our hearts. This was
the vse of Iohn the Baptist his axe.</p>
               <p>Secondly wee haue heere to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the corruption of our owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:<note place="margin">The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note>
See how slow wee are for the
obtaining of that which is good:
Wee will not labour for thinges of
worth, except that wee bee exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
therevnto. Wee know not our
wants: Wee are sicke of a <hi>Laodice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
sicknesse:<note place="margin">Revel. 3. 17.</note> Wee think that we haue
neede of nothing: If we knew what
is the worth of this meate, which
endureth vnto life, wee would vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
labour for it; where is the
wearied man that hath neede to bee
requested to rest himselfe on a bed?
What needeth a man that is hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
to bee desired to eate his meate
while it is before him? While <hi>Christ</hi>
himselfe was wearied at <hi>Sichar,</hi> hee
sought a drink of water.<note place="margin">Iohn. 4. 7.</note> * Shall a
rich man request a beggar to begge
silver from him?<note place="margin">Note.</note> And yet behold
heere, and in diverse other places of
Scripture, how wee must bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
with <hi>commandement after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,</hi>
for to seeke that which
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:19909:41"/>
is best for our Soules: Are wee not
heere commanded to seeke that meat
which will make our Soules to liue
for ever? Wee are commanded, and
yet for all that wee are slow to it:
CHRIST must make an <hi>Oyas</hi> for to

that it can not bee bought for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,<note place="margin">Isa. 55. 1.</note>
                  <hi>Ho! every one that thirsteth,

               <p>* If any Burgh of this Land would

               </p>
               <p>The vse of this doctrine is, that
wee striue to bee willing and glad
to seeke <hi>spirituall things,</hi> and to <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi>
for them. Seeing wee are so
carefull for this <hi>body,</hi> that it want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
how much more should wee
bee carefull for the <hi>Soule,</hi> which is
of greatest price.<note place="margin">Note.</note> * <hi>Bodily thinges</hi>
are like <hi>Belly thinges,</hi> they all perish
with the <hi>body</hi> and the <hi>belly.</hi> Let vs

<hi>gird vp the the loines of our mind,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 13.</note>
that according to our LORD his
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:19909:42"/>
command heere wee may <hi>labour for

               </p>
               <p>In this first part of this dayes exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,
we haue to consider two things,
first what it is to labour: secondly, for
what wee should labour.</p>
               <p>As for the first, If we would know
what labour is enjoyned heere, let vs
remember what in the former Sermon
was forbidden in labouring for perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
meat: The paines forbidden in
that point, are enjoyned heere: while
CHRIST commandeth vs to labour
for this <hi>meate of lyfe:</hi> hee willeth
vs both to labour with <hi>body</hi> &amp; <hi>soule,</hi>
both with <hi>heart</hi> and with <hi>hand:</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<hi>without or within</hi> vs must bee
away from GOD his seruice: <hi>Blesse
the LORD,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 103. 1</note> 
                  <hi>O my soule,</hi> (said David,)
<hi>and all that is within mee, blessed his

also labour for the Soule: As
Ioshuah made the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> slaues
for <hi>drawing of water for the house
of his GOD,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iosh. 9. 23.</note> so must wee make these

our affections to bee drawers of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
euen of the teares of true and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained
repentance: wee must so la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
for spirituall things, that the
care thereof take the sleepe from vs:
David arose at <hi>mid-night,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 62</note> for to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

                  <hi>the sleepe fled away

a man labour for to please a man, &amp;
shall he not much more labour for to

hee take no paines for his <hi>silly soule?</hi>
Shall a man highly esteeme things

               <p>A <hi>Seale</hi> is an outward signe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming,
ratifying, and giuing au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
to that wherevnto it is set:
Thus wee see that <hi>by the King his

               </p>
               <p>Let vs first consider the worde,
and then wee shall speake of the
diverse vses of a Seale, last of all wee
shall draw a doctrine with the vse
of application.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Seale</hi> properly signifieth
that instrument, wherewith <hi>Charters
and Patents</hi> are sealed, whereby they
are ratified and made authentick.</p>
               <p>It also siginfieth the <hi>Waxe which

ordinarily call the <hi>King his seale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Because of the diuerse vses of <hi>seales,</hi>
diverse things in Scripture are called
<hi>Seales,</hi> or as said to <hi>seale:</hi> Because
the <hi>Seale of a Charter,</hi> is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the rights therein are confirmed
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:19909:59"/>
and made authenticke, Sacraments
haue beene called seals: for by them
the writen promises of GOD are
confirmed and made more sure vnto
vs: According to this it is said of
<hi>Abraham</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 11.</note> that hee receiued <hi>the
Seale of circumcision:</hi> Because that
a <hi>missiue letter</hi> being once <hi>sealed,</hi> all
that is written within the same can
no more bee seene, but is a secret
to all that behold it outwardly: So
the things of GOD are said to bee
<hi>sealed,</hi> which are hidde or <hi>concealed,</hi>
According to this that <hi>Booke</hi> of the
Revelation,<note place="margin">Revel. 5. 7.</note> which none but the lambe

               </p>
               <p>* Wee haue also to obserue,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that
in Scripture, things are said to <hi>seale</hi>
in diuers maners: GOD is said to
<hi>seale,</hi> and man is said to <hi>seale:</hi> of
man his <hi>sealing,</hi> CHRIST speaketh,
saying,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee that hath receiued his

God is true,</hi> that is, Hee as it were
<hi>subscribeth</hi> with his hand, the trueth
of GOD his word.</p>
               <p>GOD againe is said to <hi>seale</hi> men,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:19909:59"/>
and hee is said to <hi>seale</hi> his owne
Sonne.</p>
               <p>As for men who are his elect and
chosen ones, GOD <hi>Sealeth</hi> them out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
and inwardly: Outwardly,
when hee maketh them partakers of
his Sacraments, viz. of <hi>Baptisme</hi> or
of the <hi>Supper:</hi> According to this,
it is said of <hi>Abraham,</hi> when hee
was circumcised that hee receiued
<hi>the seale of Circumcision:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 11</note> Againe
inwardly by his spirit, GOD is said to
<hi>seale,</hi> when he maketh his elect sure
of his favour or of their Salvation;
according to this the Apostle
saith to the Ephesians,<note place="margin">Ephes. 1. 13</note> 
                  <hi>In whom after

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:19909:60"/>
hath this seale, the LORD knoweth
them that are his: And let every

of GOD is his decree, vpon
which the Salvation of the godly is
builded: the trueth thereof, is made

iniquitie:<note place="margin">Note.</note> * Good workes are the
<hi>seale</hi> of the Spirit of GOD, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
a <hi>Soule</hi> is confirmed that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to the election of grace,</p>
               <p>This much for clearing of diuers
difficulties concerning sealing in the
Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Wee haue already heard how man
is said to <hi>seale</hi> GOD his trueth, &amp;
how GOD is said to <hi>seale</hi> man, both
outwardly and inwardly: In this my
Text wee haue particularly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidder,
how GOD is said to <hi>Seale</hi> his
Sonne, CHRIST IESUS, of whom
it is said heere, <hi>Him hath GOD the
Father sealed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The LORD IESUS as is well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked
by the excellent Divines, hath
beene <hi>sealed</hi> by the Father diuersely.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:19909:60"/>
First hee may bee said to haue
beene <hi>sealed</hi> by the Father,<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 3</note> because
in him was the Character, <hi>the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen
image of the Father his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
that is, as a learned Interpreter
saith, <hi>Persona quae personam pairis ad

                     </gap>culptam sigillo:</hi> The sense is this,
<hi>The person of the Father is like that
image, which is ingrauen into a seale
of Siluer or Gold, and the person
of the Sonne, is like that image in the
waxe, which is sealed by the seale of
gold:</hi> According to this, CHRIST
the second person of the Trinitie,
is said to bee <hi>sealed</hi> into an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable
manner <hi>by the Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in him is the essentiall image
of the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, CHRIST was <hi>sealed</hi> by
GOD, when hee was anointed with
the oyle of grace, and gladnesse, <hi>aboue
his fellowes:</hi> GOD the Father at that
anointing,<note place="margin">Psal. 45.</note> powred into CHRIST
man his spirituall giftes and graces
without measure:<note place="margin">Col. 1. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>All the treasures</hi>
of grace were stored vp into him:
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:19909:61"/>
                  <hi>Wee all haue receiued of his fullnesse;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn. 1. 19.</note>
The fulnesse of GOD in him was a
<hi>Seale,</hi> whereby both in his <hi>Words</hi>
and <hi>Workes</hi> hee was knowne to be
more than man, for as by his enemies
confession,<note place="margin">Iohn. 7. 46.</note> 
                  <hi>never man spake as hee spake</hi>
which was the <hi>worde Seale,</hi> S.
which his enemies could not denye
<hi>hee did among them the workes which
no other man could doe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn. 15. 24</note> this was his
<hi>worke, Seale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly GOD the Father <hi>sealed</hi>
our Saviour, when by his testimonie
from Heaven, hee declared to the
world that hee was his <hi>beloued sonne
in whom hee was well pleased.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 3. 17.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Sealing</hi> properly vnderstood
heere, as <hi>Beza</hi> thinketh denoteth two
things, first that GOD endowed him
with such a verture, whereof the like
was in no other creature,<note place="margin">Col. 2. 9.</note> for in him
the <hi>fulnesse of the Godhead</hi> and essentiall
image of the Father did so visibly
appeare,<note place="margin">Iohn, 14. 9,</note> that who <hi>sawe him did see
the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly by the <hi>Sealing</hi> of CHRIST
by the Father hee vnderstandeth a
<hi>commission</hi> from the Father, giuen
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:19909:61"/>
vnto him for to come to the world
and reconceale all repenting sinners
to their GOD: This opinion he hath
from <hi>Cyrillus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>Theophylactus</hi>
referre this <hi>Sealing</hi> of the Sonne of
man, by the Father to the testimonies
whereby the Father from Heaven
declared him to bee his Sonne, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
in those words, <hi>This is my

                  <note place="margin">Mat. 3. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>in whom I am well
pleased:</hi> This also wee must consider
that the glorious workes of Christ,
wherein the infinite vertue of GOD,
did appeare, were as <hi>a Seale,</hi> declare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the world, that God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the Saviour of the world,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Piscator</hi> interpreteth the word <hi>Sealed</hi>
after this maner: <hi>Obsignauit,</hi> (saith he)
<hi>est Metaphora sumpta ab ijs, qui quos

                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> * Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this the Father is said to

and alloweing of him by

which feedeth to euerlasting life.</p>
               <p>The doctrine <hi>I</hi> obserue heere, is
