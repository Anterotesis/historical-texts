            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE AVTHOR, TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>TVrning ouer diuers Authors, and with attention reading theyr hiſtories, the better to informe my ſelfe of the parentage, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitie, and life of our holy Queen Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabetb: I haue found that her Origen is the illuſtrious howſe of Aragon, and her alliance by mariage, with the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly howſe of Portugall, which howſes I haue noted to haue been very fruict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of holy perſons: And not only in thees two but alſo in many others, as France, Caſtile, Bohemia, Hungarie, Poland, and Brabant I haue obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the like bleſſings and favours. Amongſt which kingdomes and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedomes, the mutuall mariages and alliances from all antiquitie, by courſe even till this time haue cauſed an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitie worthie the conſideration: In
<pb facs="tcp:21429:4"/>
ſo much that the Princes and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates liuing this day, if they bee come of thees families, haue either theyr origen from the number of thees Saintes or elles are allied and of kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them reigning now in glorie with Chriſt our ſaviour.</p>
            <p>Chiefly it is to bee noted how this holy Saint Eliſabeth Queen of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall is Parent to the Emperour Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand, the <hi>2.</hi> and the Catholique King of Spaine Philip Dominicus victor, by right line in the tenth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. To the Infanta Iſabella Clara Eugenia, gouerneſs of the lowe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Burgondie, in the <hi>9.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. To the Duke of Bavaria and the Duke of Nuburg, in the <hi>11.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
            <p>The moſt Chriſtian King of France, that now liveth, is to her and S. Lewes, his predeceſſor in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of France (who was alſo of the third Order of our Seraphicall father S. Francis) and to her Siſter S. Eliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
<pb facs="tcp:21429:5"/>
who was à Nunne of S. Clares Order; in the eleventh degree: he is alſo cozen to S. Lewes Bishop of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſa, who was à Freer of S. Francis Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: and alſo to B. Ioanna Queen of France, Foundreſs of our B. Ladies order, called the Anuntiates.</p>
            <p>The King of Poland that reigneth at this day, hath in his Parentage S. Hedwigis, and her daughter. S. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude; and B. Aleyda Princeſs of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and B. Salomea Queen of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia, Moreover, he hath S. Caſimirus, his vncle, Brother to his grandfather.</p>
            <p>The Lantſgraue of Heſſen deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from S. Eliſabeth Queen of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie and Bohemia (shee was of the third order of S. Francis) hee is in the <hi>10.</hi> degree from her.</p>
            <p>The kingdomes of Hungarie and Bohemia haue honored theyr kings and Princes with parentage of Saints and Beatified, Saint Eliſabeth before mentioned, and S. Margarite (of the order of S. Dominick) Cunegunda
<pb facs="tcp:21429:5"/>
and Iolenta of the order of S. Clare: all daughters of Andrew the <hi>3.</hi> and Bela the <hi>4.</hi> Kings of Hungarie: B. Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the order of S. Clare daughter to Primiſlaus king of Bohemia: S. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus Cardinall and Martyr Bishop of Leedes (whoſe reliques ly in Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xelles in the church of the Diſcalced Carmelites, tranſlated thither from Rhems by the Archduke of happy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie Albertus the Iuſt, and Iſabella Clara Eugenia his beloued wife the year <hi>1612.)</hi> who was ſonn, brother, and vncle to the Dukes of Brabant.</p>
            <p>But heer I deſire you to marck, how the kingdome of Portugall, goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the others; for ſetting aſide the holy Eliſabeth (whoſe life shall heer briefly bee ſet downe) yee shall finde, coming out of this kingdome, the firſt king Alphonſus; the <hi>3.</hi> daughters of his ſonne Sancius; Thereſa Queen of Leon; Mafalda Queen of Caſtile, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Religiouſe of S.

<pb facs="tcp:21429:6"/>
Prince Ferdinand ſonne to king Ihon the firſt, and the Infanta Ioane daughter to king Alphonſus the fifth, all eminent for holyneſs of life and miracles: wher, in many thouſand fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies again you shall not finde one.</p>
            <p>All thees Saintes, to the number of <hi>24.</hi> haue ſprong out of thees ten Catholick families within the ſpace of about <hi>400.</hi> yeares. And had vve looked further back to theyr firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning or theyr converſion to the Chriſtian faith, everie familie would haue yealded more: for in Hungarie vve should yet haue found S. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan, and Emeric kings, and Ladiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus Prince of that Kingdome. In Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia, S. VVenceſlaus Martyr. In Auſtria, S. Leopoldus. In Brabant, SS. Pipin, Arnulphus, Emebert, Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga, Gertrude, Gudula, Pharaildis, Reynaldis, VValtrudis, Aldegund, &amp;c. and ſo in the rest.</p>
            <p>And to returne again to S. Eliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Queen of Portugall, Note, that of
<pb facs="tcp:21429:6"/>
her are come, <hi>7.</hi> Emperours, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently one after another: ſix Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes: <hi>36.</hi> Kings: and <hi>43.</hi> Queenes.</p>
            <p>All vvhich together is to bee ſeen as cleer as the ſunn; in à table which I haue ſett forth; to the honour of the ſame Saint: and vvithall, that the devout reader may ſee therin hovv men in this vvorlde (if they vvill cooperate with Gods preventing grace) notvvithſtanding maieſtie, greatneſs, might, honour, and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, may attaine to great holyneſs: And that alſo beholding and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſo manie Saints, the Chriſtian Princes that glorie to bee of theyr race may be therby ſpurred and pricked on to virtue, and follovve theyr holyneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and chooſe them for Patrones, Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, and guides, in the vnknowne vvay, of this life, and after in the iuſt iudgement of the vpright iudge.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that haue the carde which I ſet out, muſt note, firſt that it vvas not poſsible to giue all the Queenes
<pb facs="tcp:21429:7"/>
place therin, or to ſet downe theyr names, becauſe the piece is little, and alſo becauſe many of them were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to kings, whom it was no need to bring in: and thoſe that are ſet downe are without crownes, excepting the Saints, and thoſe that were heyres to kingdomes or princedomes, who by theyr mariages transferred them to other families.</p>
            <p>Secondly, heer in is cleerly to bee ſeen, the right and lawfull ſucceſsion of the kingdoms of Hungarie, and Bohemia, and all the Prouinces, and Dominions of the howſe of Auſtria vnto the perſon of Ferdinando Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of the Romanes. Alſo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance and ſucceſsion not only of all the kingdomes of Spaine but alſo of Sicilie, and Naples, of the Dukedome of Burgundie, Brabant, and the reſt of the Dominions of the lowe countries, lawfully to pertein and fall vpon the perſon of the Catholick king Philip the <hi>4.</hi> Dominic Victor, and that not by force of armes, much leſs by prudence
