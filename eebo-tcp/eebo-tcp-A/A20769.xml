            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:23186:5"/>
the speciall favour of God pointing mee as it were with the finger of his providence to the very same text, which himselfe made choice of vpon the like occasion; but my doubt is, that neither the straits of time nor my slender abilities will permit mee to handle it as I am assured hee did, though I heard him not.</p>
                  <p>They are the words of the Lord of hosts, the great <hi>Iehovah,</hi> sent by an Angel to the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> highly favoured of his God,<note place="margin">Ezech. 14.14. and 28 3.</note> and as high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended for his singular vprightnesse and great Wisdome, and by him as a principall Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of the holy Ghost left vpon record to poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for the Churches vse, so that whether we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the matter of them, or the Author from whom they are sent, or the Person to whom, wee haue every way great reason to afford them our best attention.</p>
                  <p>Now that we may somewhat the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the sense of them, it shall not perchance be amisse a little to reflect vpon the words going before from the beginning of the chapter.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Ver. 1.</note>1 <hi>At that time shall Michael stand vp, the great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people, and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was

since there was a nation,</hi> even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be deliuered every one that shall be found written in the booke.<note place="margin">V. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>And many of them that sleepe in the dust of the earth shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where by <hi>Michael</hi> (as I take it) mystically at least, if not historically Christ is meant, hee being the great Prince both of his and <hi>Daniels</hi> people which is his Church; by his <hi>standing vp,</hi> his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to judgement, by the <hi>time of trouble,</hi> the day of the worlds dissolution, which shall be indeed terrible and troublesome to the vnbeleevers and impenitent, but to the righteous a day of refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deliverance, whose names are written in the booke of life.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>many,</hi> that is all, of them that sleepe that are dead and buried, and it may bee rotten in the dust of the earth, shall be awaked or raised vp by the power of God, <hi>some,</hi> that is, the godly to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life, a life of ioy and happinesse, and <hi>some</hi> that is the wicked to everlasting shame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, &amp; not only so but to everlasting paine and torment; To which very words our Saviour seemes to allude,<note place="margin">Ioh. 5.28.29.</note> 
                     <hi>The houre is comming in the which

all that are in the graues shall heare his voyce, And shall come forth, they that haue done good vnto the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of life, and they that haue done evill vnto the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of damnation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The day of judgement and the resurrection of the dead thus described, then follow the words of my text, resuming the former branch of the precedent division. <hi>They that are wise shall shine as the brightnesse of the firmament, and they that turne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vnto righteousnesse as the starrs for ever and ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which without straining kindly enough and of themselues fall asunder into two parts, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to be rewarded, and the Reward; In the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons rewardable we haue a gift required, and two acts issuing from this gift: The gift is <hi>wisedome,</hi> the first act issueing there from is <hi>teaching,</hi> the second <hi>turning</hi> of men vnto righteousnesse by vertue of teaching: As our wisedome is from God, so it should be in part referred to the teaching of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and our teaching be directed to the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or <hi>iustifying</hi> of sinners as the Hebrew hath it. In the Reward we haue the condition of it, <hi>shining,</hi> the different degrees of this shining resembled by the brightnesse of the firmament, and that of the starrs, the latter farre surpassing the former; and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:23186:6"/>
lastly the perpetuall duration of both these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees for ever and ever: I will beginne with the gift to be rewarded, <hi>wisedome.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>For intellectuall wisedome, S. <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe was brought vp at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel</hi> a famous Lawyer; that he had well studied the Greeke Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets appeares by his quotations of them vpon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall occasions, and had he beene altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of Philosophy, he could not at <hi>Athens</hi> (<hi>at</hi> that time the most renowned Vniversity of the world) haue incountred the Philosophers both of the Epicureans and the Stoicks, being sects of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinions but bending and banding there forces both together against him. The first fruits of the Gentiles, who by the conduct of a starre came from Persia to adore our Sauiour, excelled no doubt in this kinde of wisedome. <hi>Moses</hi> was learned in all the wisedome of the Aegyptians, and so we may presume was <hi>Daniel</hi> in that of the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeans, once we are sure that <hi>Solomon</hi> even in this kinde of wisedome out-stripped all the Children of the East, hee was perfectly skil'd in all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:23186:7"/>
of vegetables, of foules, of fishes, of beasts and creeping things; whereas then the Apostle giues the Colossians a caveat and vs in them that no man spoile vs through <hi>Philosophy,</hi> his meaning is not to checke true Philosophy (whereof singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar vse may no doubt be made in Divinitie) but the errors of Philosophers, or their erroneous application of acknowledged truths; true Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie it selfe being indeed nothing else but a beame of the divine wisedome, the dictate of right reason subordinate to supernaturall revelation: which I am confident he neuer intended to gaine say or disswade.</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Morall</hi> wisedome the same Apostle speakes <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.15. Walke circumspectly not as fooles but as <hi>wise</hi>; and againe, walke <hi>in wisedome</hi> toward them which are without <hi>Col.</hi> 4.5 Of <hi>Ciuill</hi> our Saviour, Be <hi>wise</hi> as Serpents, but innocent as Doues; <hi>wise</hi> as Serpents for the iust defence of your selues, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent as Doues, that you doe not iustly offend o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

As then those other kinds of wisedome if rightly applyed, are not to be excluded out of my text, so this kinde is it, which without all doubt is chiefly vnderstood, and which we are chiefly to labour for, and that we may so labour for it as we come to the end of our desires, the meanes to attaine are these.</p>
                  <p>Frequent and fervent prayer to which S. <hi>Iames</hi> directeth, vs, If any lacke <hi>wisedome</hi> let him aske it of God, without wavering and it shall be given him; A diligent and serious study of the holy scriptures whereby <hi>David</hi> professeth himselfe to haue beene made <hi>wiser</hi> then his enemies, his teachers, his anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, A conversation comfortable to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, To him that ordereth his conversation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, will I shew the <hi>saluation</hi> of the Lord; A good vse of afflictions <hi>schola crucis, schola lucis,</hi> the

                  <p>And as these are the meanes to attaine it, so the fruits of it are good workes, which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our calleth oile in our lampes; and therevpon those Virgins who provided oile in their vessells for the supply of their lampes are by him termed <hi>wise</hi>; and S. <hi>Iames</hi> more particularly specifies those fruits; The <hi>wisedome</hi> saith he, which is from aboue is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easie to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, full of mercy &amp; good fruits, without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, without hypocrisie: It is so pure as it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>peaceable,</hi> without <hi>partiality,</hi> and without <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie</hi>: And as these be the pretious fruits, so the end of this wisedome is <hi>saluation,</hi> from a Child thou hast knowne the holy Scriptures which are able to make thee wise to <hi>saluation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In reference both to the fruits aud the end thereof, the wise <hi>Solomon</hi> hath given vs in the third of the Proverbs, a singular description of this kinde of wisedome, yet not single, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied

and attended on with the other kinds; Happie is the man that findeth <hi>wisedome,</hi>

                  <p>The first act issueing from wisedome <hi>is teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> which though it be not expressed in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish text yet is it necessarily implyed if not prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily intended in the originall word, and in some translations we haue it expressed in the very bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the text it selfe, as namely in that of <hi>Iunius</hi> and <hi>Tremellius, Erudientes</hi> teaching or teachers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:23186:9"/>Some there are who desire wisedome for their owne private contentment only, this is vaine cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riositie; some that they may be knowne to be wise, this is vaine glory; some that they may rise to honour by it, this is vaine ambition; some that by it they may grow rich, this is vaine covetousnesse; some that they may profit themselues in the way of godlinesse, this is Christian providence; and lastly some that they may doe good not only to themselues, but to others by <hi>teaching,</hi> and this is Christian Charitie. This the Angell foretells in the Chapter here goeing before, They that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand among the people shall instruct many; and againe in the latter part of the verse immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately following my text, many shall runne too and froe and knowledge shall be increased. This the Apostle exhorts vnto, Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisedome, what to doe? teaching and admonishing one another; Nay this Solomon tells vs his preacher practised, The wiser he was the more he taught the people knowledge.</p>
                  <p>He that is wise only for himselfe is a candle his vnder a bushell, but he who is wise for others is a candle set in a candlesticke, which giveth light
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:23186:10"/>
to all who are in the house; he who is wise on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for himselfe, is as a box of ointment shut and closed vp, he who is wise for others, as precious spiknard powred out, which yeelds a sweet savour to all that are in the roome; he who is wise only for himselfe, is a curtaine or carpet rooled vp, he who is wise for others, as a faire peece of Arras spread abroade and displaid to the veiw of all men. As God hath giuen vs eares to learne from others, so likewise a tongue to teach others what we haue lear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned: our eares being as the conduite pipes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uay it to the heart for our owne good, and our tongue as the cocke to conuay it forth againe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the cisterne of the heart, for the good of others; And the tongue being thus imployed is the <hi>Glory</hi> of a man; Whereas our wisedome being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed is as a treasure that is hid; of which <hi>Siraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> what profit is there in either of them? Such wisedome is none other then the talent wrapped vp in a napkin, which was not only taken from the owner of it, but himselfe cast into vtter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                  <p>Neither let vs feare that by drawing out our wisedome for the good of others we shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by draw it dry; one candle we see may serue for
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:23186:10"/>
the lighting of a thousand and yet loose nothing of its owne light; as the Widdow of <hi>Sarepta</hi> at the Prophets command, drew out of her cruse oile enough for the filling of many vessels, yet was not that in the cruse at all diminished; nay we are so farre from diminishing the oile or light of our wisedome by this meanes, that it rather hereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth, as the few loaues and fishes which were distributed among many thousands by Gods blessing multiplied into twelue baskets full; or as vessels of gold or siluer, of brasse or peuter, the more they are vsed, the sweeter and brighter they are by teaching others we call to minde many things, which we had either altogether or almost forgotten, and not only so, but thereby we fix and imprint the deeper in our minds such things as we remember, and so are vpon all occasions more ready to make vse of them aswell for our owne good, as the good of others.</p>
                  <p>Now as this office or act of teaching is thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable both to our selues and others: so is it to God most acceptable, as being in sundry places com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by him, and commended vnto vs; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it lesse honourable in it selfe then to him acceptable, whosoeuer to the doing shall adde the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:23186:11"/>
teaching of his commandements, <hi>the same shall be called great in the kingdome of heauen.</hi> Tell me I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you what were the Patriarks, the Prophets, the Priests, the Fore-runner of Christ, the Apostles, the Evangelists, the Disciples but teachers? though <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> were both of them great kings, yet is it doubtlesse no lesse honour to them to haue beene <hi>Teachers</hi> then kings; And for our blessed Saviour one speciall end as we knowe of his incarnation, why he was apparrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with our flesh, was, that he might <hi>teach</hi>; as he was a king to rule, and Priest by sacrifice to expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, so likewise a Prophet to <hi>teach</hi> his Church; And surely he <hi>taught</hi> as neuer man taught, not as the Pharises faintly and formally, but as one having authority, all men wondring at the gratious words which as from an hony-combe dropped from his lipps; in so much that a poore woman stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among the throng of the multitude, whom he <hi>taught</hi> could not hold, but cryed out, <hi>Blessed is the wombe that bare thee, and the papps that gaue thee sucke</hi>; When he left the world, the last legacie he bequeathed, was, <hi>Goe teach all nations</hi>; and being ascended he sends downe the Holy Ghost for the same purpose, not only to bee a comforter

but a <hi>teacher,</hi> according to that promise of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his ascention, <hi>hee</hi> shall <hi>teach</hi> you all things; And as both God the Sonne, and God the Holy Ghost, the second and the third Person in Trinity are <hi>Teachers,</hi> so is God the Father to the first Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the Trinitie, <hi>They shall be all taught of God</hi>; Ioh. 6.45. <hi>Cathedram habet in coelo qui corda docet</hi>; He is Doctor of the chaire in heauen, who touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and teacheth the heart</p>
                  <p>Since then this office of teaching is so profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both to our selues and others, to God so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, and in it selfe so honourable, Let him who hath this office waite vpon his office, not fleecing but feeding the flocke committed to his charge, not by constraint but willingly, not for filthy lucre, but of a readie minde, And let men so esteeme of vs as of Teachers, dispensers of the mysteries of God; we desire not to be better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of, &amp; so we desire to be accounted, we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no more from you, neither can you in dutie performe lesse to vs. <hi>Philip</hi> King of Macedon held it a great part of his sonne <hi>Alexanders</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse, that he was borne in that age, in which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi> might be his teacher; <hi>Alexander</hi> againe as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed his being to his father <hi>Philip,</hi> but his well

being to his master <hi>Aristotle</hi>; and <hi>Aristotle</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe writes, that men can neuer yeeld sufficient thanks to the Gods, to their Parents, to their teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: which if it be true of intellectuall or morall or civill wisedome, then much more of <hi>spirituall.</hi> Let them who are taught know that they owe them, who teach them by labouring in the word and doctrine, a double honour; an honour of maintenance, and an honour of reverence: He who is taught, should make him who teacheth him partaker of all his goods; and not only so, but the very feete of them, who preach the Gospell of peace, and bring glad tydings of good things, should be not only welcome but beautifull vnto vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We should be ready if occasion so required with <hi>Cornelius</hi> to kisse the very ground they tread vpon, nay with the <hi>Galatians</hi> to pluck out our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eyes to doe them service; If they sow vnto vs spirituall things, let vs not thinke it a great matter, if they reape our carnall things. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.12.</p>
                  <p>The second act issuing from wisedome but by the interueining of teaching, is the turning of men vnto righteousnesse; The principall part of our conuersion standeth in faith, and faith commeth by hearing, now hearing there can not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:23186:12"/>
teaching, nor profitable teaching without wisedome; So that wisedome is as the roote, teaching, as the stalke springing from this roote, and this kinde of turning as the flowre shooting forth from this stalke I deny not but men may be and sometimes are turned vnto righteousnesse by miracles, by extraordinary reuelations, or the mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nistery of Angels, or that they who are not wise for themselues, by teaching may affect it in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as <hi>Noahs</hi> carpenters built an Arke for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of others, being drowned themselues, and the braine imparts sense to the other members, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing insensible in it selfe; I know that a key of iron may open a locke as well as of siluer, and that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be as commodiously conuaied through leaden as golden pipes; yet withall I beleeue, that Almighty God much rather and more frequently vseth the ministerie of those, who are truly wise and are turned themselues, for the making of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wise and the turning of them to righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as water they say in its naturall course can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be brought to mount higher then the spring: so neither can a man well speake to the heart but from the heart.</p>
                  <p>Our teaching then should not be for the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:23186:13"/>
of applause from men, or the gaining of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to our selues, but for the winning of glory to God, and the gaining of soules to him; The talents which he hath bestowed vpon vs and instructed vs with, should be put forth vpon interest not so much for our owne worldly profit, as our masters best aduantage.</p>

                     <hi>Generare sibi simile est perfectissimum opus natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae,</hi> saith the <hi>Prince</hi> of Philosophers, For a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall body to propagate another in the same kinde like it selfe, is the most perfect worke of nature, and so <hi>regenerare sibi similem est per fectissimum opus gratiae,</hi> for a regenerate man to be an instrument vnder God, or as God himselfe is content to speake, a fellow-workeman with him in the regeneration of another, is the most absolute worke of grace; There cannot likely be a more apparent marke of a reprobate mind, then an endeauour to diuert and turne men away from righteousnesse, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:23186:13"/>
of turning many vnto righteousnes. The fire hath in it an inclination of turning all things it touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into its owne nature, and it cannot be, but an heart truly enflamed with holy zeale as with fire from heauen, should desire to make all it touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or comes neere vnto, like it selfe. The Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists they talke and bragge much of turning iron into gold by vertue of the Philosophers stone, as they call it, but sure it is, that the best Alchymie we can practise is the turning of mens iron hearts into the gold of righteousnesse and that by <hi>teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> the true Philosophers stone ordained by God himselfe for the transmutation of such mettalls; by it euen whiles we walke in the flesh, but warre not after the flesh, are we made partakers of the diuine nature, we are transformed &amp; metamorphized (as it were) from tares into wheat, from wolues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to lambs, from kites into doues, from bryars and thistles into faire and fruitfull trees, to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into the Paradise of God, which all the teaching of the Gentiles could neuer effect; they might perchance turne men to a seeming kind of righteousnesse, but to true righteousnesse they did not, they could not. But this was it that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Dauid</hi> in his teaching aymed at, and no doubt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:23186:14"/>
accomplished, <hi>Then shall I teach thy wayes vnto the wicked, and sinners shall be converted vnto thee</hi>; the end of his teaching was the conuersion of sinners, as they through the suggestion of <hi>Satan</hi> and wicked men (their owne inbred corruption working therewith) had by sinne turned themselues from the Creator to the Creature, so he by teaching en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauoureth their returne backe againe from the Creature to the Creator. This was it which S. <hi>Paul</hi> proposeth to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and would haue <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> in his teaching propose to himselfe.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4 16.</note> Take heede to thy selfe and to Doctrine, continue therein, for in so doeing thou shalt both saue thy selfe and them that heare thee; Take heede to thy selfe, that so thou maist saue thy selfe; Take heede to thy Doctrine, to thy teaching, that thereby thou maist saue others. And this is it which S. <hi>Iames</hi> seemes to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend vnto vs as a great worke indeede; Let him know (saith he) that he who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth a sinner from the error of his way, shall saue a soule from death, and hide a multitude of sinnes; Let him know that he hath done a great, a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, a noble &amp; a worthy worke, such a worke as he hath great reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> seriously to reioyce &amp; triumph in, as no doubt S. <hi>Peter</hi> did in the conuersion of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:23186:14"/>
those three thousand which by one Sermon of his were turned vnto righteousnesse, more then if he had beene put into possession of both the Indies or of all the Kingdomes of the world and the glory of them.</p>
                  <p>It is worth our obseruation that in the message of the Angel touching the Baptist sent to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Zachary,</hi> it is said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he should haue great ioy and gladnesse and many should reioyce at his birth, and withall that he should be great in the sight of the Lord; now from whence should this ioy arise to his parents; this comfort to his friends, this greatnesse to himselfe? It followes, many of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> shall he <hi>turne</hi> to the Lord their God; that is, he shall by his teaching turne many vnto righteousnesse, here then was matter indeed of true joy to his Parents, of true comfort to his friends, and of true greatnesse to himselfe; No mary aile then if our Sauiour accounted this his meat; if the life of S. <hi>Paul</hi> was not deare vnto him in respect of this, nay if he were willing to dye in this imployment,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.15.</note> Though I be offered vp vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad; Finally he accounted this his hope, his joy, and the crowne of his reioycing at the comming

                  <p>Then shall <hi>Andrew</hi> come in with <hi>Achaia</hi> by him converted to the saving knowledge of the truth, <hi>Iohn</hi> with Asia, <hi>Thomas</hi> with India, <hi>Peter</hi> with the Iewes, and <hi>Paul</hi> with the Gentiles; and what shall we then plead for our selues, if being called to yeeld an account of our stewardship we cannot bring forth so much as one soule converted by vs in the whole course of our ministerie? Surely it is either because we teach not at all, or our teaching is not grounded vpon wisedome, or it is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon carnal and not vpon spirituall wisedome, revealed to vs in the sacred oracles of Gods word: Some there are who so are aloft in the clouds fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the peoples eares with swelling words, and their heads with frothy speculations; Others, who feed them with the husks of vnsavoury tales and jests: thus whiles the one sort seeke to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired rather then vnderstood, &amp; the other make themselues ridiculous rather then venerable, (both sorts so teaching as if neither the teachers themselues, nor the people taught had soules to be saued) they rather turne men out of the Church to <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Amsterdame,</hi> or harden them in their prophanenesse and irreligion, then turne them to

righteousnesse; Yet let vs not wrong the age wherein we liue, nor slight the graces of God conferred on it: I am confident wee may boldly affirme of it, that God gaue the word and great is the company of the Preachers, neuer any age be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, nor at this present any king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or country in the world, affording so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, so able, so faithfull Teachers; and if many thereby be not turned to righteousnesse, it is their owne fault, nay it serues to aggravate both their offence and their punishment, it takes away all colour from excuse, and adds weight to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; And so I passe from the persons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardable to the reward it selfe, the second maine branch of my Text.</p>

                  <p>The shining light was at leastwise of all the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible creatures the first that Almighty God made, and among them all it is the most beautifull, the most cheerefull, the most vsefull.

                  <p>We shall then behold him face to face, who is the light of the world, who lightneth every man that commeth into the world, who is the father of lights, who is cloathed with light as with a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and dwelleth in light that is inaccessable, which no man can approach or attaine vnto, and in his light shall we see light, nay in his light shall we bee light.

When <hi>Moses</hi> came downe from the mount and from talking with God, his face shoone so bright as the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites could not behold the brightnesse of it but he was forced to couer it with a vaile, that so he might talke with them; and of S. <hi>Stephen</hi> it is said, that all who sate in the counsell where he was conuented and arrained, looking stedfastly on him saw his face, as it had beene the face of an Angel: now if it please God thus to conferre such a wonderfull measure of shining glory vpon his seruants here on earth, what shall we conceaue he hath reserued for the glorified <hi>Saints</hi> in heauen? at the transfiguration of our <hi>Sauiour,</hi> we read that his face did shine as the Sunne, and his very ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was white as the light, which <hi>Saint Peter</hi> standing by and beholding was so rauished as he talked of building tabernacles for <hi>Moses</hi> &amp; <hi>Elias,</hi> not well knowing what he spake, yet was all this but a tipe as it were or shadowe of that glory and Maiesty, with which hee was afterward to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested

though they neuer haue the function nor the gifts to teach, shall shine as the one: but they who haue both the calling and abilitie to teach, and withall a blessing vpon their labours thereby to turne many vnto righteousnesse, as the other, as the brightest starres for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p>I am not ignorant that some learned Divines haue not only doubted of this disparity of glory in the Saints, but haue denyed it and disputed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it; yet those very men haue confessed it to haue beene agreed vpon by the generall consent of the Fathers, which for mine owne part I must professe I am vnwilling to forsake, specially where the Scripture and reasons drawne from thence are so faire for it, and in the analogie of faith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing against it.</p>
                  <p>That there are diversitie of gifts, and withall that we are to covet the best gifts, S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath made it evident, and our Sauiour that of the seed which fell in good ground, some brought forth an hundred, some sixtie, some thirty fold; and what they teach we find confirmed by daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.

                  <p>He that gained two talents to his Master, and he that gained fiue, they are both commended for their faithfullnes, &amp; both entred into their masters ioy; yet as their talents were at first bestowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them according to their seuerall abilities, so no doubt but their reward was in some sort propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to their severall gaines, which partly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in this, that the talent which was taken from him who had but one, was conferred vpon him who had gained fiue, and not vpon him who had gained but two. It is by all Divines freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that there shall be different degrees of punishments in hell, in as much as it shall be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier in the day of iudgment for some, then for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and some shall be beaten with more, others with fewer stripes; why not then different re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wards, or rather different degrees of the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in heauen? It is true that for the greater ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour the degrees of punishments are thus differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

in Gods iustice according to our deserts, yet may it well be that for our better encouragement likewise in his mercy he hath thus proportioned out these different degrees in our reward, not for any merit of ours, but partly thereby to quicken vs in the way of vertue and godlinesse, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to shew his truth, as in disposing of all things so of his rewards, as a man that hath many sonnes, and promiseth to proportion out his Legacies to them, as they shall shoote neerer or farther off the marke, set up by himselfe, conditionally that they hitt the butt, is in a manner bound to bequeath him the fairest portion who comes neerest the white, not for the merit of the sonne, but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his owne promise.</p>
                  <p>Little is the knowledge God knowes, very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle which we poore wormes here crawling vpon the face of the earth, haue of things that are in heauen, farther then in holy Scripture they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed vnto vs yet thus much we know that those blessed ministring spirits, by their maker called Angels, because they are his messengers sent forth to minister for their sakes who shall be heires of saluation, are not all of equall ranke, some being Cherubins and Seraphins, others thrones and

Now as in the life to come we shall be like the Angels free from the vse and want of those perishable things which this life stands in neede of, so likewise it is not improbable but the glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Saints, may some way resemble the different orders in the severall distribution of rewards; and to come somewhat neerer my text, and withall fully home to the poynt in hand, There is saith the Apostle, <hi>one glory of the sunne, another glory of the moone, another glory of the starres, and one starre diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from another in glory</hi>; &amp; then presently inferres, so shall it be in the resurrection, as one starre diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from another in motion, in situation, in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, in influence, in order (the starres in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der fought against <hi>Sisera</hi>) so likewise both in big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and brightnesse: and so shall it be in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</p>

tabernacle, the remainders of his mortality by vs to be interred with Christian buriall in assured hope of a ioyfull resurrection, might iustly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it not the least part of his happinesse, that he was brought into the light, during the raigne of that truely noble and renowned Lady, <hi>Queene Elizabeth,</hi> and by that meanes was baptized in the same faith and religion in which he departed this life. He was descended of an honest, a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and religious parentage, brought vp in a libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and free manner, first in the country, and then in the Vniuersity, where he receaued the highest degree that Mother of his could bestow vpon him saue one, but in the iudgment of all that knew him, deserued that too better then many who haue receaued it both before him and since him; so as whether his degrees more honoured him, or he them, as well by the exercise he performed for them, as by his sweet conversation and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in all kind of learning, is not easie to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine: by the divine Providence he was there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated into that seminary, which hath yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded many goodly plants to our Church, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the rest our right reverend Diocesan, his contemporarie and ancient acquaintance, He had
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:23186:26"/>
to Vncle by the Mothers side that <hi>Iewell</hi> of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the mirrour of our age, for sanctitie, Pietie, and Theologie all in one, whom he proposed to himselfe as a patterne for imitation; He liued to see his Childrens Children, and his Elder sisters Childrens Childrens Children to his great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and yet by Gods blessing is his Fathers Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet living too, and present at his funerall. Had his meanes been answearable to his worth, he had not layen in such obscuritie as he did, but had doubtlesse moued and shined in a farre higher and larger spheare then he did, yet God so blessed him with competent meanes, that he liued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly, brought vp his Children in a decent manner, furnished himselfe with a faire Librarie, releeued the poore, was not wanting to his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that stood in want of his help, &amp; for hospita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stant in it, entertaining his friends, and such as came to visite him in a cheerefull and plentifull manner; But vpon these I will not insist, chusing rather to come to those which are more proper both to him and my text: his intellectuall, his morall, his civil, his spiritual wisdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, his teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; his turning of many vnto righteousnesse.</p>
                  <p>First then for his intellectuall wisdome; the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:23186:26"/>
sharpnesse of his wit, the fastnesse of his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the soundnesse of his iudgment were in him all three so rarely mixed as few men attaine them single in that degree; His skill in the langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges was extraordinary, Hebrew, Greeke, Latin, French, Spanish, and I think Italian; His know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the liberall arts and Sciences was vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall, Grammar, Logick, Rhetorick, Poetry, History, Philosophy, Musick and the rest of the Mathematickes; in some of which Sciences he so far excelled, that I dare say in these westerne parts of the kingdome he hath not left his equall: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe I speake any thing to amplifie by way of Rhetorick, I speake lesse then the truth.</p>
                  <p>His morall wisdome appeared in the checking of his appetite by temperance and sobrietie; free he was in the lawfull vse of Gods creatures, but neuer excessiue, nor euer could be drawne to it, either by example or perswasion: which in a constitution so crazie was no doubt vnder God a speciall meanes for the drawing out the thread of his life; in his carriage he was graue yet sociable enough, courteous yet without affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or vaine complement, a sure friend to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of his power, where he professed it, yet without flatterie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:23186:27"/>His ciuill wisdome appeared in the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his parrish and his family, in the educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Children and the Children of his freinds vpon speciall request committed to his charge, in his owne matches and the matches of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and lastly in the preseruing, managing and disposing of that estate which God lent him, in an orderly manner.</p>
                  <p>His spirituall or diuine wisdome appeared, in his great knowledge in the sacred scripture, in which with <hi>Timothy</hi> he was trained vp from a Child, and as another <hi>Apollos</hi> grew mighty in them; whereunto he added the helpe of the best Interpreters both ancient and moderne, the seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous study of the Fathers, the schoole-diuines, the Ecclesiasticall story, and the controuersies of the present times, aswell with the <hi>Romanists</hi> as among our selues, &amp; that in matters not only of Doctrine but discipline; in all which he was so well studied and vpon all fitting occasions so willing and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy either by writing or speech to expresse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, as many, and those not vnlearned Divines were content, nay glad to draw water from his well, and to light their candles at his torch; nay some of his aduersaries in his life time, haue in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:23186:27"/>
open pulpit since his death, to Gods glory, their owne comfort, and his honour confessed as much. But the highest point of his spirituall wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome appeared in the practise of piety, in a due conformitie of his actions to his speculation drawing out as it were a faire coppy in the course of his life, of those wholesome lessons which he found in his bookes, formed in his braine, and taught to others; And herein indeede doe I take the very marrow and pith of spirituall wisdome to consist, in the possession and fruition of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall truths, according to that of the great Earle of Mirandula, <hi>Veritatem Philosophia quaerit, Theologia inuenit, religio possidet,</hi> Philosophy seekes the truth, Diuinity finds it, but religion possess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it; Religion I say, which bindes vs to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of our duties to God and man.</p>
                  <p>One maine branch of this duty and effect of this wisdome was his <hi>Teaching</hi>; He taught euery where &amp; euery way, by his example &amp; by his pen, but specially by his tongue; by his tongue both priuately and publiquely, publiquely by expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, by catechizing, by preaching: in which he was so diligent, that since his entring into the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery (which he often professed to be his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:23186:28"/>
honour and comfort in this world) he waded through the whole body of the Bible, from the beginning of <hi>Genesis</hi> to the end of the reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And as he was thus diligent in teaching, so was he constant in his course as long as his health and strength would giue him leaue, and <hi>I</hi> may truly say beyond his strength, resoluing with that vncle of his no lesse good then great, that a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral should die in the feild, &amp; a Preacher in the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit. The manner of his teaching was not by loud vociferation, or ridiculous gesticulation, or osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of wit, or affectation of words, but in the euident demonstration of the spirit and power, it was demonstratiue, masculine and mighty, through God to the pulling downe of strong holds, deepe it was and yet cleare, rationall and yet diuine, perspicuous yet punctuall, artificial yet profitable, calme yet peircing, po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derous yet fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, so as the ablest of his hearers might alwayes learne somewhat, &amp; yet the simplest vnderstand all: which was a rare mixture, and in this mixture hee ran a middle &amp; moderate course, most agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Canons &amp; constitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of that Church in which hee was borne and bred, betwixt the apish superstition of some, and the peevish singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:23186:28"/>
of others, betwixt blind deuotion and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bold presumption, betwixt vnreasonable obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and vnwarrantable disconformitie, betwixt popish tyranny grounded vpon carnall policie, and popular confusion guided by meere fancie, the one labouring for an vsurped Monarchy, and to turne all the body into head, the other for a lawlesse anarchy, and to haue a body without a head.</p>
                  <p>Now though in his teaching he ranne this mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle course, yet did it alwayes aime not only at the information of the iudgment, but the reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the will, the beating downe of impiety, and the convincing of the conscience, to the drawing of his hearers as from ignorance to knowledge, and from errour to truth, so likewise thereby from rebellion to obedience, from prophanenesse to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; And truely I little doubt but many a good soule now a Saint in heauen did they vnderstand our actions and desires, and withall could make knowne their conceits to vs, would soone giue vs to vnderstand that vnder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God he was the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the turning of them to righteousnesse, and so for the directing and conducting of them to that place of their blisse; and as little doubt I
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:23186:29"/>
but many a good soule who heares me this day, in secret and in silence, blesseth God and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of this good man, for that spirituall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and comfort which they haue receaued by his Ministery; once I am sure that a vertuous Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman of good note and ranke, hath since his death by her letters written with her owne hand to some of his neerest freinds testified, her turning to righteousnesse to haue beene first wrought by his meanes; and noe question but many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers might as iustly and truly doe the like, were they so disposed, or occasion required it.</p>
                  <p>This was the course of his life here, now for the manner of his departure hence; when his last sicknesse first seazed on him, he accounted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe noe man of this world; when he was in his best health though as a pilgrime he walked in it, yet as a souldier he neuer warred after it, but now being thus arested and imprisoned he professed to his friends who came to visite him (holding vp his hands to heauen) that though his body was here yet his heart was aboue, and consequently his treasure; for where a mans treasure is, there will his heart be also; He likewise assured vs that though he saw death approaching, yet he feared
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:23186:29"/>
it not, death being now but a droane, &amp; the sting thereof taken out; during his sicknes he made his household, his congregation, his chamber, his chappell, and his bed his pulpit, from whence he cast forth many hloy and heauenly eiaculations, and made a most diuine confession of his faith, not onely to the satisfaction and instruction, but admiration of his hearers; Among the rest two things there were, which he much and often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted vpon, the one that he hoped onely to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the merits of Iesus Christ, the other that he constantly perseuered in the faith and religion professed and maintained in the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, in which he was borne, baptized and bred: and this he many times and earnestly protested in a very serious and solemne manner, pawning his soule vpon the truth thereof. His glasse being now almost runne, and the houre of his dissolution drawing on (though his memorie and senses no way failed him) he desired to be absolued after the manner prescribed by our Church, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his desire hauing first made a briefe confession, &amp; therevpon expressing a hearty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition together with an assurance of remission
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:23186:30"/>
by the pretious bloud of his deare Sauiour, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued absolution fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the mouth of a lawfull mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, &amp; having receiued it, professed that he found great ease &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort therein, &amp; withall that he was desirous likewise to haue receiued the blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Eucharist, if the state of his body would haue permitted him; &amp; not long after ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining with himselfe, that he heard some sweete Musike &amp; calling vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ, Sweet Iesus kill me that I may liue with thee, he sweetly fell asleepe in the Lord, as did the Protomartyr, who ready to yeeld vp the Ghost prayed and said, Lord Iesus receiue my spirit.</p>
                  <p>Thus he liued and thus he dyed, neere ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching the great climactericall of his age; And by this time I am sure you find and feele with me that we haue all a great losse in the losse of this one man; His flocke hath lost a faithfull pastor, his wife a louing husband, his children a tender fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, his seruants a good master, his neighbours a freindly neighbour, his freinds a trusty freind, his kindred a deare kinsman, this whole countrey a great ornament; The king hath lost a loyall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the kingdome a true-hearted Englishman, the

No man euer knew him but must needs say that one of the brightest Starres in our West is now set; The excellent parts that were in him, were a fit instance for that your learnedly defended posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the vigour of this last age, wherevnto he gaue his accurate, and witty astipulation.

of the sorrow of his losse, by preseruing aliue some of the post-hume issue of that gracious and exquisite brayne, which when the world shall see, they will marvell that such excellencies could lye so close; and shall confesse them as much past value, as recovery; Besides those skill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and rare peeces of Divinity tracts, and Sermons; I hope (for my old loue to those studies) we shall see abroad some excellent monuments of his Latine Poesie; in which faculty I dare boldly say, few, if any, in our age exceeded him.

The truth of which three questions while I endeavour to resolue not so much with heat and vehemence of passion, as strength and evidence of reason: let me entreat you all, Right Worshipfull Reverend and beloued Christian brethren, but for the space of one houre to lay aside all preiudice, and to heare with indifference what I can say. When I haue done, if my resolutions appeare to be grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sound and convincing arguments, I hope you will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your duties readily yeeld vnto the truth: if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, every one may still abound in his owne sense and yee haue free liberty to carry home the same opinion ye brought hither with you. In the meane season I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech

the Lord to direct your hearts, and to giue you a right iudgement in all things.</p>
                  <p>The first Quere is, whether preaching in this place be distinguished from reading. In resoluing whereof I will not be so peremptory as some are: only I will shew what I conceiue and vpon what grounds. This I conceiue, that Preaching here is no other then the publike Reading of <hi>Moses:</hi> and I conceiue so vpon these grounds, because there appeareth nothing in the words to force a distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but rather something importing an identity. That there is nothing to enforce a distinction appeares, if either yee consider the context and reason of the words, or the text it selfe and the forme of words vsed therein. First therefore as touching the Context, It is manifest by this particle <hi>For,</hi> that these words are inferred as a reason vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some thing premised. <hi>Thus.</hi> Some of the beleeuing Pharisees had taught the brethren at <hi>Antioch,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 15.5.</note> that except they were circumcised and together with the faith of Christ obserued the ceremonie of <hi>Moses</hi> they could not be saved.<note place="margin">vers. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> Whereof after much altercation and dispute the Apostles being advertized,<note place="margin">vers. 4.6.</note> they summon a counsell at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to stint the quarrell.<note place="margin">vers. 7. &amp;c.</note> In it Saint <hi>Peter</hi> expresly affirmeth, that salvation is impossible by the law, and that the grace of Christ is of it selfe every way sufficient which sentence Saint <hi>Iames</hi> hauing readily approved, he adds withall,<note place="margin">vers. 13.14.15.</note> that for the setling of the Churches peace, it would not be amisse to write vnto the beleeuing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>that they abstaine from pollutions of idols,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">vers. 19.20.</note> 
                     <hi>from forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, from things strangled, and from blood. For,</hi> saith he, <hi>Moses of old time hath in every Citty them that preach him, being read in the Synagogues every Sabbath day.</hi> Now how comes in this <hi>For</hi>? and what is that conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:23186:34"/>
whereof this is a reason? Heere I finde difference of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions: but among them all three seeme to me to bee most probable. Of them all take which you list, and the publike Reading of <hi>Moses</hi> alone will bee a sufficient proofe thereof.</p>
                  <p>The first opinion is Saint <hi>Chrysostoms,</hi> in whose iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Saint <hi>Iames</hi> would proue this conclusion, that it is altogether needlesse to write vnto the beleeuing <hi>Iewes</hi> touching abstinence from these things. And why is it needlesse? Because they perfectly know these things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. But how came they to the knowledge of them? By hearing <hi>Moses</hi> publikely read in the Synagogues eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sabbath day: for he in such cleare &amp; expresse tearmes hath deliuered the same, that whosoeuer heareth cannot but take notice thereof, as besides sundry other places you may see in <hi>Num.</hi> 25. and <hi>Lev.</hi> 17. which you may pervse at your better leasure.<note place="margin">Num. 25.1. &amp;c Lev. 17.10.</note> The second opinion is of the French translators: <hi>this.</hi> Ye may not thinke that by this decree the law of <hi>Moses</hi> will be vilipended or dise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed. Why? Because the <hi>Reading of Moses,</hi> saith the marginall note, will not be discontinued in the assemblies of the beleeuing <hi>Iewes,</hi> neyther will the beleeuing <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> make scruple to assist them therein. The third and last is the common opinion, and carries with it best like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood: <hi>this.</hi> We must for a while condescend to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing Iew in observation of the ceremonie, least wee scandall them, and cause them to stagger in the faith. The reason, because they know by the weekely reading of <hi>Moses</hi> that it is his ordinance: to whom they are so strongly addicted, that they cannot yet without danger to their faith be weaned from him. And thus take which of these conclusions you please, and the sole reading of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:23186:35"/>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> is a sufficient proofe thereof. You will say, so is interpretation also. I denie it not: only I affirme that from the context or reason of the words yee cannot force a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction betweene Preaching and Reading.</p>
                  <p>No more can you from the Text, and the forme of words vsed therein. Indeed if the words were in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall as <hi>Hieron.</hi> to whom wee are referred englishes them,<note place="margin">In Preachers plea.</note> 
                     <hi>debellatum esset, the warre were ended.</hi> For thus he renders them, <hi>Moses was both read and preached,</hi> then which a plainer distinction cannot bee. Whether so read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he intended the advantage of his cause, I will not say. <hi>Demortuis nil nisi bene:</hi> he was while hee liued a graue and reverend preacher. Howbeit the originall reads o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>hee hath them that preach him being read. Beza</hi> turnes it thus <hi>cum legatur, seeing he is read</hi>: others thus, <hi>in that,</hi> or <hi>inasmuch as hee is read.</hi> Which how it can inforce a distinction I see not: rather it imports the contrary, that Preaching here is no other then Reading. So seemeth the Syriack also to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it, <hi>Moses hath Caroze, Haralds, or Criers in the Synagogues, who read him every Sabbath day.</hi> And indeed the word <gap reason="foreign">

No more can he Preaching from reading in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:23186:35"/>
this place: for the case is exactly the same.</p>
                  <p>Adde herevnto that such Preaching euen in the judgement of the adversarie is here meant, as was ever performed in every <hi>Synagogue vpon every Sabbath day.</hi> Now that <hi>Moses of old was read in the Synagogues every Sabbath day,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 13.27.</note> it is cleare in my text. So is it also Act. 13.27. <hi>the voices of the Prophets are read every Sabbath day.</hi> But that <hi>Moses</hi> in every Synagogue every Sabbath day was interpreted and Sermons made vpon him, doth not appeare, and I thinke will hardly be proued. For as for those places where in mention is made of exhortation af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reading, they are to little purpose: inasmuch as they only show what sometimes and vsually, not what was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies done. In the <hi>Sabbatticall</hi> yeare vpon the feast of <hi>Tabernacles,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut 33.10.11</note> the law was commanded to be read: of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding there is no mention at all. Nay seeing then the whole law was intirely to be read, it seemes very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that in such ascantling of time there could bee no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding. In the dayes of good King <hi>Iosiah,</hi> the booke of the law which <hi>Hilkiah</hi> had found in the house of the Lord was read in the eares of all the people:<note place="margin">2 King. 23.2.</note> but of expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition not a word.<note place="margin">N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Ezra</hi> also the Priest read the law before the congregation from morning till midday: but that his reading was interrupted by interpretation is not so cleare as you are borne in hand. For first, if any did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret it was the <hi>Levites</hi>: but that <hi>Ezra</hi> the Priest, and a Scribe so learned should be put to the inferior and baser office of reading, and the <hi>Levites</hi> but pettie ones, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison advanced vnto the higher and worthier of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting, seemes altogether improbable. Secondly, where it is said the <hi>Levites caused the people to vnderstand the law:</hi> that it seemes was done not by way of expounding,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:23186:36"/>
but by causing the people to stand still in their places, and to giue due attention. As for that which followes <hi>they gaue the sense, and caused them to vnderstand the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> it is in the originall thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and may fitly be rendred <hi>they made attention and vnderstood the reading</hi>: referring the distinct reading of the law vnto <hi>Ezra,</hi> making of attention to the <hi>Levites</hi> &amp; vnderstanding to the people. And thus doe sundry wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Divines conceiue of this place. All which not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, because diverse other great clarkes, &amp; amongst the rest our late translators are of another mind, I may not be too peremptorie herein. Yet will I be bold to inferre, that vnlesse they can proue that sermons were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Sabbath made in evey Synagogue (which I thinke they will neuer proue) Preaching in this place will be all one with Reading.</p>
                  <p>So will it be also, vnlesse they can shew that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was read was expounded: for it seemes by the text that whatsoever was read was preached. But as with vs, the Psalmes and Lessons and Epistles and Gospells with other parcells of Scripture read every Lords day in our Churches, are not nor cannot all at once be expounded, but only some small portion: so the Petaroths or Sections of the law and the Prophets,<note place="margin">Elias Levita.</note> ordained by <hi>Ezra</hi> of old to be read in the Synagogues every Sabbath day, are as they are set downe by the sonne of <hi>Maimonie</hi> so large,<note place="margin">Ben. Maimon.</note> that they could not possibly, at leastwise conveniently bee in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terpreted at one time. I presume therefore all was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted which was read: yet all was preached which was read: wherefore Preaching cannot in this place bee interpreted but only Reading.</p>
                  <p>Besides these reasons, least any should thinke I stand
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:23186:36"/>
single, and by my selfe alone, it may please you to know that I am backed with the authority of sundry graue Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines: of whom I will name two onlie, with either of whom that one to whom we are referred is no way to be compared.<note place="margin">Apol. against T.C.</note> The one is reverend <hi>Whitgift</hi> late Archbishop of the See of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in his defence against <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright:</hi> the other is learned and profound <hi>Hooker,</hi> the hammer of our Schismatickes, whose bookes they are afraid to looke vpon least they be confounded,<note place="margin">Eccles.

Whitgift</hi> addes, that all expositors he could meet withall were of the same mind: so that in effect I am warranted with a cloud of witnesses. Against all which, besides confident assevera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I find nothing opposed saue one only passage out of the second tome of Homilies:<note place="margin">Hom. 1. p. 1.</note> wherein say they, our church doth principallie fasten on this text to proue a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction betweene Preaching and Reading. Wherevnto I answere, that the intent of the Homilie is to shew the right vse of Churches, and that in them the word of God should be both read and interpreted: and to this end are alledged sundry passages out of the Acts, together with this text, all which ioyntly but not severally conclude what was intended. For <hi>Act.</hi> 13.5. speaketh only of <hi>Preaching,</hi> this text only of <hi>Reading,</hi> and <hi>Act.</hi> 13.14. of both. But how soever the <hi>Homilie</hi> vnderstand this place, sure I am both this booke and the Church of England ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Reading</hi> as an effectuall <hi>Preaching,</hi> as shall anon in the due place be demonstrated.</p>
                  <p>In the meane season I hope I may be bold out of all these premises to inferre this conclusion, that if any haue publikely said, that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>whosoever collecteth out of this text</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:23186:37"/>
Reading <hi>to be</hi> Preaching <hi>is no better then a seducing spirit, giues the lye to his mother the Church of England, yea to God himselfe, and is mad with reason.</hi> Hee himselfe at that time spake more out of Passion then reason. For a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Spirit is not every one that erreth and delivereth what he conceiueth to be true: but hee who out of the loue of errour endeavoureth to lead others astray from the truth. And ô thou glorious Archangell of the Church of England <hi>Whitgift,</hi> wert thou also a seducing Spirit? Or was it true of our Church in thy time which the Prophet spake of his, <hi>Doctores tui Seductores tui,</hi> thy teachers are thy seducers? And thou profound <hi>Hooker,</hi> then whom never any man spake with more reason, werst thou also mad with reason? And yee both when yee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke the defence of the <hi>Politie</hi> and government of your <hi>Mother,</hi> did you vnder pretence thereof giue the lye vnto your Mother, yea even to God your Father al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so? What shall I say? The Lord forgiue these intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate speeches. The best buckler to defend off such veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous arrowes is a good conscience and Christian pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And thus armed I passe to the second part.</p>
                  <p>The second Quere is, whether <hi>Reading</hi> be a kinde of <hi>Preaching.</hi> That <hi>Reading</hi> should be called or counted a kinde of Preaching there is a generation that at no hand can endure. Such language they hold to be a foule Sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisme in divinity: but the doctrine it selfe a great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment vnto Preaching. What, say they, when our Saviour commanded his Apostles to goe into the World,<note place="margin">Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Paul</hi> saith
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:23186:37"/>
                     <hi>to the Romans, How can they preach except they bee sent,</hi> doth not this imply that Preaching is more then bare Reading?<note place="margin">2. Cor. 2.16.</note> When the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> said, <hi>How beautifull vpon the mountaines are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace, &amp;c.</hi> Doe you thinke hee spake this of one that should come with a booke in his pocket and read vnto Sion? <hi>Who,</hi> saith S.

These are their choicest ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections out of Scripture: vnto all which I briefly answer thus. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: I looked that they should punctually conclude, <hi>Ergo</hi> Reading is no kind of Preaching, but they insteed hereof substitute another conclusion, Reading is not all that Preaching that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in a Minister, which who denies? For wee freely confesse more is required then ability to Read: except only then when sufficient Ministers, or there where suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient maintenance cannot be had. In such a case better a Reader then none, to publish Gods word, to baptize chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to administer the Communion, and to performe other necessary duties, which but by a Minister may not be done. As for the descant vpon this plainsong, what? did Christ command no more then to come with a book in ones pocket, and to read fairely? from what spirit it proceeds I will not say: sure I am it is a stale popish iest. <hi>Thinkest thou,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Defens. eccles. author. l. 3. c. 7.</note> saith Stapleton vnto Whitaker, <hi>when Paul preached vnto the Gentiles to convert them, hee deliuered them the booke of the old Testament, or recited and read the same vnto them</hi>?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:23186:38"/>But besides testimonie of Scripture they vouch the authority of the booke of Homilies and Canons: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the one distinguisheth Readers from Preachers, which were great wrong vnto them if they be Preachers. The other forbiddeth Ministers to preach in private, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I may not so much as read a chapter in my house if Reading be Preaching. This argument I thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues make as little reckoning of, as they doe of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority whereon it is grounded. For it is a plaine fallacy of Equivocation, and they must needs be very blinde if they discerne it not. For when our Church putteth a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction betwixt Readers and Preachers, shee vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Preaching in the strict and speciall signification for one kinde of Preaching, namely interpreting or making of Sermons. And in this sense it is most true Reading is not Preaching: and very simple must he be that holdeth bare Reading to be the making of a Sermon. But when we say Reading is Preaching, we vnderstand Preaching in a more large and generall signification, as by and by you shall heare: wherevnto because they speake not, they speake not to the purpose.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, this doctrine, say they, is a maintainer of <hi>Idlers, and dumb dogs, and soule murtherers,</hi> &amp; what not? <hi>Pax mifrater,</hi> good words I pray you, for these are but the evaporations of a hot braine. Farre be it from vs by any meanes to maintaine any such kinde of Cattle. Wee wish with all our hearts, that not only all Ministers, but all the people of God could prophecie. Howbeit, were there not an idler, nor dumb dog, nor soule-murtherer, as these men are pleased to tearme them, in our Church: yet if publicke Reading continue, and I hope it will continue so long as the Sunne and Moone endureth, Reading will
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:23186:38"/>
ever bee a kinde of Preaching. In the meane season I could wish that they who are so eager against dumbe dogges, would sometimes remember to turne the edge of their tongues against bawling curres also, with whom the Church of God is as much pestered as the other: those I meane who behaue themselues so audaciously &amp; confidently in the pulpit, yet haue neither the learning nor the wisdome to speake humbly, discreetly, and to the purpose.</p>
                  <p>One argument yet remaines, Preaching was before the word written: but before writing Reading could not be: Reading therefore cannot be Preaching. Pardon me my brethren if I call a spade a spade, and in plaine English say, this is a meere Popish argument. For in like manner reasoneth <hi>Charron</hi> a French Papist,<note place="margin">Trois verites l. 3. c. 4. par. 3.</note> to proue that Faith is not taught by Writing or Reading. The Scripture, saith he, came but late into the world: and the world had beene without it for the space of two thousand fiue hundred yeares, namely all the time from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moses.</hi> If then in the meane while the Faith was published to the world and receaued by it, it could not bee by the word written or read (which then was not) but onely by the word preached and heard. But in the same sort, as <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Iunius</hi> confronteth <hi>Charron,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Confront. ibid</note> so will I answere these men. First, although before <hi>Moses</hi> no part of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non was written: yet happily there might be other god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and holy bookes penned, out of which the true faith might be learned. Secondly, grant that at that time no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all was written: yet the argument followeth not, <hi>The world was a long time without Scripture,</hi> Ergo <hi>neither now is it the purpose of God to teach by Writing or Reading.</hi> For contrarily, seeing it hath pleased God of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:23186:39"/>
at length to commit his word vnto writing, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest that he now intends men should learne the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof even by Reading also. Wherefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that as before Writing there was happily but one kinde of preaching, namely speaking to the eare: so now since the time that Gods word hath beene written, there are more kindes then one, namely speaking to the eye too.</p>
                  <p>Thus hauing remoued these rubs as it were out of our way, let vs proceed in Gods name to maintaine the truth propounded, that Reading is a kind of Preaching: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I must intreat you againe &amp; againe not to mistake me, as if I held bare Reading to be all that Preaching which is required in a Minister; or that it is the making of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that is, the expounding of a Text, deducing of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and particular application of the same by way of exhortation. Farre be such vanitie and folly from mee. What then? Surely by Preaching generally I vnderstand the publishing, or notifying, or making knowne of Gods word. Which seeing it may be done by sundry waies &amp; meanes, as inwardly, outwardly, publikely, privately, by word, by writing, by speaking, by reading, by Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, by conference, and the like: I boldly affirme that there are diverse kinds of Preaching, and that Reading is one of them. And least any man should thinke I stretch the word Preaching too farre: bee it knowne vnto you that I doe no more then <hi>Martin Bucer</hi> sometime Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Reader in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> as he is cited by D. <hi>Whitgift,</hi> hath long since done before me: for as he granteth that there are sundry sorts of Preaching, so among them he reckons Reading for one. And whatsoever some punies avouch to the contrary, I dare engage all the poore skill I haue

So that (to come to an issue) when we say rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is a kinde of preaching, our plaine meaning is, that it is a way or meanes by which the word of God is pub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Which being so, what is it, my bretheren, that so much offendeth and angreth you? Is it the inconvenience of the tearmes, or the vntruth of the proposition? For indeed I finde you so variable and vncertaine that I know not well where to finde you. Is it the language that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth so harsh and jarring to your eares? It seemed not so vnto the ancients, who made no scruple to speake so. Learned <hi>Hooker</hi> who carefully inquired into this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, hath obserued to my hands divers passages. <hi>The Councell of Vaux saith,</hi>

                     <hi>If a Presbyter or Minister cannot through infirmity preach by himselfe, he may preach by his Deacon reading some Homily of the Fathers.</hi> Where note by the way that if reading an Homily bee Preaching, Reading of Gods word is much more.<note place="margin">Can 11.</note>

Reading? For doe you not in ordinary speech call your Preachers Lecturers? And what is that but Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders? And when you would knowe who preaches, is it not your manner to aske who reades? And the Sermons of a Preacher, doe you not style them his Lectures or Readings? But to leaue descanting, besides that the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall words, as we haue said, include both Reading and Sermoning: let it in particular be observed that the word <gap reason="foreign">

But I beseech you my brethren, doe you indeed thinke Reading is no way a publishing or making knowne of Gods will? I can hardly beleeue it. When God first commanded the law, and afterward the Sermons of the Prophets, and succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siuely the whole Canon of Faith to be written, the old Testament in the vulgar language of the Iewes, the new
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:23186:41"/>
in the tongue that then was most generally vnderstood: what was his intent and purpose therein? Was it not to <hi>endoctrinate his Church, that we through patience &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Scripture might haue hope?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 15.4.</note> When the Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint by the speciall providence of God translated the bookes of the old Testament out of Hebrew into Greek, and the whole body of Scripture vnder Christianity was so carefully turned into all languages: was not the one done for the information of those Iewes that were Hellenists and vnderstood not Hebrew, and the other for the instruction of such Christians as knew no other but their mother tongue? Doubtlesse it was. For translation say our last learned translators,<note place="margin">Preface to the Reader.</note> 
                     <hi>is it that openeth the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow to let in the light, that breaketh the shell that wee may eat the kernell, that putteth aside the curtaine that wee may looke into the most holy place, that remoueth away the couer of the well that we may come by the water.</hi> Furthermore, what is the reason that so many graue and learned men haue in all ages published so many excellent bookes? and that Preachers also not content to haue spoken by word of mouth vnto their auditory, cause their Sermons to be set forth in print vnto the world? Is it not that they who never knewe nor heard them may yet reape benefit by their writing? True it is that neither Originall, nor Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation, nor any booke whatsoever can availe, if it be loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vp in a chest,<note place="margin">Deut. 13.11. &amp; 17.1. &amp; 6.6.</note> or laid on a deske, and never be opened or looked into. God therefore commanded in the old Testament that the law should be read both publikely &amp; privately:<note place="margin">Ioh. 5.39.</note> and Christ hath ordained the same in the new. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> when he wrote his Epistles, meant not that they should lie still vnder seale:<note place="margin">Col. 4.16.</note> but, saith he, <hi>when this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle is read among you, cause that it bee read also in the

Now all this <hi>cui bono</hi>? and to what end such a world of bookes, but that by reading them we may attaine to knowledge? Surely if wee poore schollers were no better furthered in our stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies by Reading then by Sermons: small would bee our knowledge, and poore God wot the entertainment yee were like to receiue from vs. Our Saviour Christ thought that Reading might instruct,<note place="margin">Mat. 24.15.</note> when hee said <hi>Qui legit intelligat,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 3.4.</note> 
                     <hi>let him that readeth vnderstand</hi>: and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> when he wrote, <hi>By reading ye may vnderstand my knowledge in the misterie of Christ.</hi> But what need wee to multiply arguments, seeing it is not only confessed that <hi>Reading is after a sort a publishing of Gods word,</hi> but also such a publishing as prepareth way vnto faith, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth it when it is obtained, which cannot bee but by teaching and notifying the truth. I conclude therefore that reading is a meanes whereby the will of God is made knowne, and consequently is Preaching. Which if any yet againe purpose to gainesay, let me intreat them, not to say one thing, to wit, that Reading is not Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to meane another, thus, Reading is not Sermon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or all the Preaching required: but to speake to the purpose, and punctually to demonstrate, that reading is not a publishing of Gods word, which I know they can never doe, and I thinke they will bee ashamed to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. And so I passe from the second vnto the third part.</p>
                  <p>The third and last Quere is touching the vertue and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacie
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:23186:42"/>
of <hi>Reading,</hi> whether it be an ordinary meanes to beget faith and to convert a soule. That it should haue such a faculty is with much confidence denied: Faith and conversion by all meanes must be restrained to Sermons and the Preachers mouth. Some little of their holy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sprinkle are they content to bestow vpon reading. It may pretily fit a man to heare a Sermon, and further him when he hath heard: it may serue to nourish, set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and increase faith when it is gotten, but to begin, to breed, to worke faith where it is not, that belongs vnto a Preacher, nothing can effect it but a Sermon.

knowledge so gotten is but vaine iangling, and swimmeth in the braine, but converts not the heart. So that had wee verbatim written all those heavenly Sermons which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul the Apostle of the Gentiles</hi> preached among them: had we that famous <hi>Sermon of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Peter</hi> by which three thousand soules at once were added to the Church:<note place="margin">Act. 2.41.</note> nay had we all the gratious words sanctified by our blessed Sauiours owne mouth while he liued here in the flesh: yet could they not beget faith or convert a soule, but only extraordinarily, and by way of miracle. A strange and incredible assertion, and they had need to be armed with mighty demonstrations to persuade it. Let vs therefore examine the force of them.</p>
                  <p>First they vrge that of <hi>Elihu</hi> in the booke of <hi>Iob,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iob. 33.23.24</note> 
                     <hi>If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand to shew vnto man his righteousnesse: then is he gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious vnto him, and saith, deliuer him from going downe to the pit, I haue found a ransome.</hi> Here deliuerance is by a messenger: this messenger is a minister, and that not a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but Preacher, there being in <hi>Iobs</hi> time no Scripture and consequently no reading. Wherevnto I answere first, that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> signifies also an Angell, &amp; that therevpon some interpret it of a good Angell, others of the Angell of the covenant, rendring the words thus. <hi>If there be an Angell speaking for him, and shewing for man his righteousnesse.</hi> If so, as it is very probable, then is the argument of no force, here being no speech of a Minister but mediator, nor of a Preacher speaking to man, but of an advocate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceding for man. Secondly, be it that a Preaching Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister is meant, yet not every one, but one among a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand. For to say that not one among a thousand Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, but one Minister among a thousand men is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:23186:43"/>
is too sleight. <hi>Mercer</hi> is of another minde; and <hi>Oecolampade</hi> conceiues it of a graue, intelligent, and wise teacher, such as is rarely to be found. And so by this rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning Faith should be tied very s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ort: and the Sermons of vulgar and ordinary Preachers should not be able to beget Faith, Lastlie, he that attributeth such efficacy to Sermons, doth not so doing deny it vnto other meanes: and who,<note place="margin">Contra Char. l. 3. c. 4.</note> saith <hi>Iunius,</hi> hauing any Christian sense or zeale dare say that Faith is not to be advanced by all meanes? yea, but in <hi>Iobs</hi> time Reading could not bee a meanes. True: yet it followeth not but now it may bee a meanes. Then it was not when there was nothing to be read: now it is as we haue shewed, the whole Canon being written.</p>

And as vndou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is it that God revealeth himselfe by more waies then by Sermons. Howbeit I deny not but in some sense it may be truely said <hi>where vocall Preaching is not there the people perish:</hi> not for that they want the Ordinary meanes as long as they haue the written word, but because of their negligence and retchlesnesse who of themselues will

Secondly suppose that preaching of Sermons were here meant, yet what consequence is this, Sermons breed Faith, <hi>ergo</hi> Reading doth not? For both may.

First then graunt that Faith dependeth vpon such Preaching as may bee heard, yet this lets not but it may be the effect of reading: for when the word is publikely read, I hope it is heard also. But I answere secondly, and more roundly to the purpose, that Hearing in this place betokeneth not onely the outward act, or, as Philosophers call it, passion of the

                     <note place="margin">Cont. A.D. c. 9</note> by what way soever. This exposition <hi>Wotton</hi> approuing, he further addes, that it is not the Apostles purpose to disable the word Read, but partly to shew that the meanes of salvation proceed from God alone, partly that no man might excuse himselfe by ignorance, God hauing sent his servants into all the world: without which sending none might preach either by word or writing, and without which preaching no man could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue. And thus haue you both the true meaning of this place,, and a full answere vnto the objection. Other pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages besides these doe they vrge: but being either of the same nature, or of lesse moment, I will not trouble you with them.</p>
                  <p>Now it remaineth breefly to resolue and confirme the truth. Wherein to the end it may appeare, that what I haue often maintained in private, I am neither afraid nor ashamed publikely to professe in pulpit: I here openly proclaime, and confidently affirme, that <hi>Reading is an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meanes to beget Faith and convert a soule.</hi> Which that I may the more clearely and distinctly demonstrate, giue me leaue in few words to open the tearmes &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>Proposition.</hi> First then by Faith I vnderstand not only that whereby wee yeeld assent vnto Scripture the Principle of Faith that it is Gods word, &amp; to all those
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:23186:45"/>
articles of Faith specially fundamentall established by this principle, which we call Historicall or Dogmaticall Faith: but that Faith also whereby we are justified, and by which we accept Christ to be our <hi>Mediator, King, Priest, and Prophet,</hi> together with the effects thereof, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance from dead workes, and new obedience. All this I comprehend vnder the name of Faith. Secondly by Meanes I vnderstand such middle or secondary causes as come betweene the first cause and the effect for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of it. And these meanes if they be <hi>praeter ordinem</hi> besides the perpetuall order placed in things, there being no coherence betweene them and the effect, or no aptnes in them to produce the effect, then doe we call them Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary: and such was the feeding of <hi>Elias</hi> by Ravens and the curing of the blinde man by dawbing clay vpon his eyes.<note place="margin">1. King. 17.6. Ioh. 19.6.</note> But if they be <hi>secundum ordinem</hi> according to the perpetuall order established in things, having in them an aptnesse and fitnesse to produce the effect, then are they called Ordinary: and such is the nourishing and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining of man by bread. Now the soveraigne &amp; prime cause of Faith is God. God worketh it by his word. The word worketh as a <hi>Doctrinall</hi> or <hi>Morall</hi> instrument by way of argument &amp; perswasion. Before it can perswade it must be revealed. God therefore revealeth it, and that sometimes without meanes, by an immediate impression of light and grace vpon the soule,<note place="margin">Act. 2.4. Act 9.3. &amp;c. Gal. 1.12.</note> as he did vnto the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles on the feast of Pentecost, and to S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney towards Damascus. But generally and for the most part he revealeth it mediately and by the intervention of meanes. The <hi>Ordinary meanes</hi> is that which is setled and established to continue in the Church for ever. That is the <hi>Ministerie</hi> of the Church, whose office is by all meanes
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:23186:45"/>
to publish the word, whether by <hi>Writing</hi> or by <hi>Speaking,</hi> and this againe whether by <hi>Reading</hi> or <hi>Interpreting.</hi> All which, if they haue in them an ability and fitnesse vnder God to convey into our hearts the knowledge of his word, then vndoubtedly are they all <hi>Ordinary meanes to beget faith.</hi> And such an ordinary meanes among the rest doe I affirme Reading to be. Which hauing thus fully explained the tearmes, I now come to demonstrate: and first in that faith whereby we yeeld assent vnto the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that it is the very word of God.</p>
                  <p>The last and highest principle whereinto Faith is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued, and wherevpon it finally stayeth it selfe is the Scripture: yet is it not so vnto vs vntill we be perswaded that it is the word of the eternall verity, which can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther erre nor lead into errour. But how come we to bee. perswaded hereof? By Sermons? I deny not but Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons are vnder God a sufficient meanes to perswade it. But when did you ever heare a Preacher treat of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, or goe about to proue it? Or if any haue done it, did they not perswade you to that whereof you were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready perswaded? Yes questionlesse. For besides the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie of the Church, in the publike reading of the Scriptures as the word of God, there shineth forth in them such a Majestie and divinenesse as is not to be found in other writings: and when by Reading yet take notice of so many oracles, and miracles, and predictions, and sundry other things farre exceeding the power of nature,<note place="margin">Dupl. cont. Stap. l. 2. c. 6.</note> doth not reason it selfe tell you, saith <hi>Whitaker,</hi> that they must needs bee of God?<note place="margin">In the way to the true Ch.</note> The same saith D. <hi>Iohn White Many times Pagans and Atheists without the Ministery come to Faith by only Reading: whence but being convinced by Scripture it selfe</hi>? If then the very Reading of holy
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:23186:46"/>
Scripture may bring vnto our knowledge such remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances and arguments as convince the minde that it is the word of God, certainely it is an ordinary meanes to beget this faith: for what can be more ordinary then ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and demonstrations. But the former is true, as we haue proued: therefore the latter also.</p>
                  <p>If so, then much more is it apt and fit to beget that Faith whereby we yeeld assent to those articles which are built vpon Scripture: especially if two things may be granted, first that it is perfect, secondly that it is facile &amp; easie to be vnderstood. That it is all-sufficient and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth whatsoeuer is necessary either to bee beleeued or done vnto saluation, none but a Papist will deny. And surely if it be defectiue, either it is from God, or from the pen-men. Not from the pen-men, for they were but hands, and could not but write what the head indited to them. If from God, then either because he could not, or because he would not perfect it. To say he could not, is to derogate from his wisdome and power: to say hee would not is to detract from his loue, and to taxe him of envie. But what need mee to spend more time in this point, seeing I now deale against those who challenge vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it such a perfection, that nothing may be done, no not to the taking vp of a straw, without warrant from it. The Scripture then is perfect: is it also facile and easie to bee vnderstood? <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith of his <hi>Acroamaticks</hi> that they were <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, published in that they were writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not published because of their darknesse. In the books of <hi>Heraclitus</hi> there was so great obscurity, that he was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Obscure.</hi> May wee iustly say the same of the Scriptures, and the pen-men thereof? Surely it cannot be denied but that some things are difficult: yet as
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:23186:46"/>
there are deepe places where the Elephant may swim, so there are shallow where the Lamb may wade: and as there is harder meat which the strong man may chew, so there is milk also which the infant may suck. And I bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirme that all fundamentall points and duties necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to salvation are in Scripture so clearely delivered, that if they were written with a sunbeame they could not bee more cleare.<note place="margin">In Ps. 26.</note>

                     <note place="margin">De verb. scrip.</note> 
                     <hi>will a Father speake obscurely to his children in things concerning their salvation, that they shall need to seeke interpreters? No verily.</hi> But God being wise was able to expresse himselfe, and being good he would: and it was necessary to speake plainely in things so necessary. If then, to come to a conclusion, Scripture containe all what is necessary, and that in such plaine tearmes that whosoeuer readeth may easily vnderstand: how can it be but Reading should be an apt and fit meanes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently an ordinary meanes to beget this Faith? For if once we beleeue that Scripture is the word of God, we cannot but yeeld assent vnto those verities that are so plainely deliuered therein, and which we knowe to bee witnessed by the truth it selfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:23186:47"/>The same doe I also affirme of that Faith which wee call iustifying, and of the fruits thereof, <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>New obedience,</hi> that the Reading of Scripture is an apt &amp; fit meanes to beget that also. For it presenteth vnto vs store of strong motiues to perswade, sweet promises to allure, terrible threatnings to affright, notable examples to imitate, and the like: then which there cannot be a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter outward meanes, and there needs no more but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward concurrence of Gods spirit to worke a perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.

And what that intrinsicall and proper quality of Sermons is whereby <hi>Faith</hi> is begotten which is not also to be found in Reading. Is it in the doctrine and matter of Sermons? It is the very same which wee read. Is it in the arguments and motiues whereby they perswade? We read either the same, or as forcible in the <hi>Scripture.</hi> What then? Is it in the vtterance, voice, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, behauiour, or credit of the <hi>Preacher</hi>? Much lesse: for then should we be beholding for our <hi>Faith to acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents more then substance,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cor. 2.4.</note> &amp; to the plausible inticements of humane wisdome, rather then the evidence &amp; demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the spirit. Wherein then lies the vertue? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth in Gods blessing: for Preaching is the ordinance of God, and he hath promised to blesse it. But stay, my bretheren, is not Reading Gods ordinance also? And
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:23186:47"/>
doth God, having imprinted in it such an aptnesse and fitnesse ordinarily to beget Faith, either curse his owne ordinance, or suspend the operation of it so, as it shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver worke but only extraordinarily? What shall I say? When they haue answered what they can vnto the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, the summe of all, as <hi>Hooker</hi> obserueth will be this, Sermons are and must be the only ordinary meanes, but why and wherefore we cannot tell. And so I passe from the first argument, drawne from the aptnesse and fitnesse of Reading to produce all these kindes of Faith.</p>
                  <p>Now in the second place I dispute <hi>ex concessis,</hi> from that which is yeelded and granted by the adversarie. First it is granted by <hi>Hieron,</hi> and we haue proued it by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie of M. <hi>Fox</hi> to be true, that many of our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the blinde time of Popery were converted to the true Faith by reading only. This, say they, was extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary: but I infer that therfore it was ordinary. For if rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding be excluded, &amp; sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s be the only ordinary means, it will follow that the Church at that time was without the ordinary meanes: for wholsome Sermons then were not to bee had. But it is a strange point in Divinity that the Ordinary meanes should at any time fayle in the Church: and I presume when that fayleth the Church of God will fayle also. If so, then is there some other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meanes besides Sermons; and what can that bee but the written word and the Reading thereof?</p>
                  <p>It is further granted, and that rightly, that whosoever readeth the Scriptures, or heareth them read, is therevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bound to beleeue. And this is so cleare a truth, that <hi>Whitaker</hi> could not forbare to charge his adversary <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton</hi> with much folly for holding the contrary:<note place="margin">Dupl. contr. Stapl. l. 1. c. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Sic tu planè desipis,</hi> saith he, <hi>Art thou so very a foole as to thinke that the word of God hath no authority, or bindeth no man
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:23186:48"/>
to beleeue, but then when it is preached?</hi> Certainely if the doctrine of Christ and his Apostles was to be beleeued when it was deliuered by them in their Sermons: it is as much now to be beleeued when it is convayed vnto vs by way of writing and reading. Wherevpon saith <hi>Caluin Although the Apostles be dead, yet their doctrine liueth &amp; flourisheth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.15.</note> 
                     <hi>and it is our dutie to profit by their writing as much as if themselues were now publikely speaking before our eyes.</hi> Vnlesse therefore Gods word cease to bee his word when it is read, an obligation in reading is laid vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs, to yeeld all credence and obedience vnto it. Now God bindeth not but by a commandement. He comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth therefore to beleeue by Reading. What? Doth he command vs to beleeue by a meanes that is vtterly vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and vnfit to worke beleefe? And doth hee daily and hourely tye our Faith vnto that which hee meanes not to blesse vnto that end, but once as it were in an age and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily? Questionlesse, seeing God hath ordained that his holy Scriptures be ordinarily read both in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and private, and hath bound vs all to beleeue when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer we either read them or heare them read: it cannot be but that Reading is an ordinary meanes to beget faith, and that God will alwaies vouchsafe to blesse his owne ordinance to the same end.</p>
                  <p>In the third place I vrge the testimonie and authoritie of holy writ. But happily so doing I may be counted in the number of those vile men, who like venomous spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders suck poyson out of the sweetest flowres. <gap reason="foreign">

law before all Israell in their hearing. Gather the people to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, men, and women, and children, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may heare, and that they may learne, and feare the Lord your God, and obserue to doe all the words of his Law.</hi> Here in expresse tearmes the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the law is commanded: and it is particularly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to this end that men may learne thereby. What? the feare of God, and obedience to the Law. God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath appointed Reading to be an Ordinary meanes of conversion. It is answered that such Reading is meant as was accompanied with interpretation. So they dreame indeed: but in the text there is no mention of interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Neither is it likely, seeing now the whole law was to be read at once, as is aboue said, and the scantling of time would hardly beare any exposition. Howsoeuer, sure I am the holy Ghost ascribeth the effect vnto Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and I thinke hee both knewe and meant what hee said.<note place="margin">Ier. 36.2. &amp;c.</note> In the Prophecie of Ieremie God commandeth the Prophet to write all his Prophecies in a booke, that all the house of <hi>Iudah</hi> might heare them read, <hi>for it may bee,</hi> saith God, <hi>that hearing they may returne every man from his evill way, that I may forgiue their iniquity and their sinne.</hi> According to this commandement <hi>Ieremie</hi> dictates all the Prophecies vnto <hi>Baruch, Baruch</hi> writes them, and being written reads them in the house of the Lord. Here againe Reading is commanded by God, and to the same end, that the people thereby might bee moued to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. To this they answer, first that God speaketh after the manner of men. True, when he saith it may be, as if he knewe no more then man what the effect would bee. Yet is it plainely intimated that Reading is an ordinary meanes of repentance. Secondly, say they, <hi>Ieremie</hi> had
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:23186:49"/>
preached the same before, and so they are Sermons that are commanded to be read. Be it so. Yet then the very <hi>Reading of Sermons may worke Repentance,</hi> which the Preaching of them could not. To say nothing that these Sermons written were Gods word both for matter and manner: so that if the Reading of them might be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to conversion, the like efficacie cannot reasonably bee denied vnto the Reading of that written word which now we haue. Lastly, say they, this was extraordinary, for <hi>Ieremie</hi> was in prison and could not come to preach. It is vntrue that <hi>Ieremie</hi> was now in prison: for then the Princes would not haue said vnto <hi>Baruch,</hi>

                     <hi>I am shut vp I cannot goe into the house of the Lord,</hi> the best Expositors vnderstand it of some other impediment, and not imprisonment. But bee it that <hi>Ieremie</hi> was in prison, yet is the Reading of his prophecies no more extraordinary then the Reading of any other booke of Scripture, nor the Reading, of these lesse effectuall then of them. To let passe sundry other passages of Scripture, I vrge in the last place that of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi>

                     <hi>These things are written that yee might beleeue that Iesus is the Christ the sonne of God, and that beleeuing yee might haue life through his name.</hi> Here writing is made the meanes of beleeuing, as beleeuing is made the meanes of life everlasting. But Writing without Reading is void and of no effect: the meaning thereof is as if he had said, <hi>These are written to the end that by reading them yee may beleeue.</hi> For to restraine it thus, <hi>These thing are wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the end that a Preacher by discoursing or making Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons vpon some parcells of them may worke Faith in you,</hi> is too absurd and shamelesse: although I deny not that

Withall as I suppose I haue made a sufficient Apologie both for my selfe and other my reverend brethren, who in the general vnderstanding of the ordinary auditory of this place haue beene publikely censured as <hi>Seducing Spirits,</hi> for holding that which I haue now maintained. Reason would that he who seemed to lay this scandall vpon vs should haue made publike amends, and either haue inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted himselfe if he were mis-vnderstood, or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged his rashnesse if he did so censure. But seeing it will not be, and so much charity cannot be found in the heart, yea over and aboue, seeing I haue since that time beene braued to my face, and as I am credibly informed, often insulted vpon behinde my back, as if I durst not publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shew my face in these points: though otherwise I could haue beene content to hold my peace for the peace of the Church, yet now I could doe no other then I haue done, and pardon me I beseech you, for herevnto haue I beene forced and constrained. Sooner perhaps would I haue discharged my selfe of this burthen, if sooner I could haue met with so fit an auditory.

Preaching some while since in this place on <hi>Luc.</hi> 20.34.35. and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring as my Text occasioned me,<note place="margin">Luc. 20.34.35.</note> who they were that <hi>should be accounted worthy to obtaine the next world, and the resurrection from the dead,</hi> I affirmed first in generall that it was not semblance only or shew of religion that could make a man worthie, and then in particular, that a man might be a frequent auditor of Sermons, might goe two, three, foure, more miles to heare them, all the while might looke the Preacher starke in the face, afterward returne with ioy, call to minde, talke, conferre and repeat the same, and yet for all this still be counted vnworthy. And fearing least I should bee mis-vnderstood, I then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated you not to mistake me, as if I misliked Sermons, or the going to them. Nay I exhorted you to goe, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded you went not with contempt of Divine Service at home, nor departing from your owne Minister how meane a Preacher soever, none I thinke being so meane but is able to teach you more then you knowe: provided also that you passe not through the Church-yards of as reverend and learned men as these parts afford any to go
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:23186:52"/>
a mile further to heare a novice, and when you are retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that your repetitions bee not vaineglorious, with such a rumble, and after the manner of a riot, but modest and severally in your owne houses, and lastly that the fruit of your often hearing be not a demure looke onely and a prating tongue, but true humility &amp; charity which best conformeth vs vnto IESVS CHRIST. These things I then said, and for ought I yet see said not amisse: yet am I censured as an enimie to Sermons, as one that greeues the hearts of Gods Saints, and lash the faults of Hypocrites on the backes of Gods children. Wherefore you see I haue reason now to be warie of my selfe, and to prevent the like danger that I bee not the second time mistaken, as if I spake in derogation of <hi>Sermons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sermons I acknowledge to be the blessed ordinance of God, &amp; as learned <hi>Hooker</hi> saith, they are the keyes to the kingdome of heauen, wings to the soule, spurres to our good affections, food to them that are sound and healthy, and vnto diseased mindes physicke. Whatsoever any can truely say in honour of them, withall our hearts we sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe vnto it. If comparison be made betweene <hi>Reading</hi> and <hi>Sermons,</hi> wee readily yeeld the precedencie to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. For although it be the same word which is read &amp; treated vpon: yet the manner which is or should be vsed in Sermons, by explaining that which is hard, deducing of doctrines, and applying them home vnto the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, doth more speedily and easily informe the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and beget Faith, as he that is taught by one that is his crafts master shall sooner attaine to knowledge then he that is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and hath no other helpe then his owne industrie. I adde farther that whosoever neglecteth or contemneth Sermons, neglecteth and contemneth the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:23186:53"/>
ordinance of God, and consequently God himselfe: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may such a one looke for a blessing from God vpon his Reading or whatsoever other meanes hee vseth. So that my desire is by all meanes to encourage all, and by no meanes to disharten any from the frequent hearing of Sermons.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit I may not so advance Sermons but that I must giue Reading the due also. Never more need. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Papists the Stewes passe vnpunished, but to read privately in the Bible is death: their publike reading is in a tongue vnknowne, whereby they make God <hi>a Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to the people. Smith a Puritan, a Brownist, an Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist, a Se-baptist,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mar. 4.17.20.</note> what not? saith that Reading is but a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie, and that our Saviour read indeed to fulfill all righteousnes, but when he had done shut the book to put an end to the ceremonie. Hee saith farther that Reading is the Ministerie of the letter &amp; so of death; and that it is vnlawfull in worship to hold a booke before the eye. Our brethren of the faction haue not only said it, but also printed it, that <hi>Reading is not feeding, but as evill as play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a stage, and worse too.</hi> And is it not the manner of many,<note place="margin">Admon. to the Parliament.</note> neglecting publike Service and Reading, to send their servants or children to see whether the Preacher be ready to goe into the pulpit? For till then they list not come, and so according to the <hi>Frenchiest, turne all Gods worship into a meere preachment.</hi> To say nothing that they tie your Faith vnto the Preachers mouth, and deny vnto Reading all power to beget it: the contrarie whereof you haue now heard sufficiently, as I am perswaded, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated vnto you.</p>
                  <p>Behold therefore, blessed bretheren, behold the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Gods bountie and goodnesse in making the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:23186:53"/>
meanes of your saluation so facile and easie vnto you. He hath made every one of you capable of reading: there is none but may learne to read if he will. It is as easie as to learne to play at tables or cardes: and a little of the time which some spend in Alehouses and idle exercises would soone make them perfect schollers therein. But were it difficult to read, yet haue you eares, and you may daily heare Gods word both publikely and privately read vnto you in your mother tongue, if so you please. It is hid from none but those that will not seeke it, saith <hi>Chrysostome</hi>: and it is exposed and made obvious to every one, least any should perish for want of ability to finde it. It is not so high aboue thee,<note place="margin">Deut. 30 11.12.13.14.</note> 
                     <hi>as Moses saith, that thou shouldest say, who shall goe vp for vs to heauen and bring it to vs?</hi> Neither is it so farre from thee, that thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest say, <hi>who shall goe ouer the Sea for vs and bring it vnto vs</hi>? But the word is very nigh thee: if thou wilt but open thy eyes, thou maist read it at thy pleasure, or if thou wilt but lend an eare, thou maist when thou wilt heare it read vnto thee. Let no man thinke himselfe abandond of God, or destitute of all meanes, as long as hee hath free liberty to read or heare the written word. Neither yet let any man say vnto mee, what need Sermons if reading be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient? For it is as if he should say, what need two eyes if a man may see with one? No, my brethren, God is more bountifull and liberall then so: and as he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided more kinde of stuffes for our backe then one, and more kinde of meats for our belly then one, so hath hee ordained more meanes of Faith and Salvation then one.

But the speciall ordinary meanes and most powerfull vsuall meanes is the word Preached. This is it which the Scripture layeth downe, Rom. 10.14. 1. Cor. 1.21.</p>

                     <p>Quest. But is it necessarie that the word should bee Preached to the engendring of faith in vs, or will it not suffice to read it? Ans. It is not to be doubted, but a man may be converted by the word read. For <hi>Luther by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was turned from Popery, and Iohn Huske by reading of Wickliffes bookes</hi> (<hi>And in the margent he noteth, that</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine saith he was converted by reading Confes. lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 12.) &amp; whatsoeuer is set forth in Preaching the same is read also: and the reading of the word in a large sence, as Preaching is put for publishing Gods will to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, is said to be Preaching, Act. 15.21. and such as read are pronounced blessed Rev. 1.3. yet notwithstanding when the word is preached as preaching in a more strict sence signifieth expounding teaching and exhorting out of the word of God, it is more effectuall.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>There may be a question made whether the word of God read only may become effectuall to regenerate: or whether it must want this efficacy vnlesse it be <hi>Preached as well as Read?</hi> To which question mee thinkes that this should be a true answer, that the instrumentall power of regenerating cannot bee denied to the <hi>Scriptures barely read,</hi> though <hi>Preaching</hi> be not ioyned withall. For why?
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:23186:57"/>
seeing the doctrine of the Gospell is called the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of the spirit, and it is the doctrine of the Gospell when it is offered to the vnderstanding by bare reading: therefore it must follow that in such case al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so it may become the power of God vnto salvation, and the instrument of the spirit vnto regeneration. The same precepts promises and threats are by reading delivered to the mind of the man that readeth or heareth the word read. And why then should wee thinke that the Holy Ghost either cannot or will not worke together with them? Yea doubtlesse hee can doe it when he will, and will doe it then whensoeuer he doth not (as oftentimes he doth not) afford to men a possibility of enioying any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther helpe then reading. Vnlesse the not being preached could make the word not to be the law of God, I see no reason that it should be thought vnable to convert soules without being preached. <hi>And a little after.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It will not at all follow that because the word read is able to beget Faith, either the Ministers may content themselues vsually to read it without preaching, or the people vsually content themselues to heare it so, and not be carefull to seeke for the preaching of it.</p>

                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 5. Let vs see this enthymeme or imperfect argument of <hi>Pyrrhonian Logicke:</hi> The Apostles first taught by liuely voice, <hi>Ergo</hi> they pretended not to teach by their writings which succeeded their preaching. The consequence is as good as who should say, one eateth first for to nourish himselfe, therefore drinke serueth nothing to nourishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. <hi>A non distributo ad distributum &amp;c.</hi> And a little after.</p>
                     <p>Wee know that to preach and to write are things very accordant, and which are comprehended in one and the same commandement giuen to the Apostles teach all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which yet to this day they teach by their writings. He which commanded them the thing which is to teach, commanded also the manners of teaching, which are to preach with liuely voice, and to set forth the doctrine in writing, both of them being fit for teaching, and this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter most fit for to continue, and to transferre doctrines and instructions vnto posterity.</p>
                     <p>Daniel Chamier in his Panstratia Tomo. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Lib. 1. c. 21. num. 6. To teach comprehendeth as well the liuely voice as writing. So Paul preached the Gospell vnto the <hi>Romanes</hi> no lesse by writing an epistle vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then teaching them by liuely voice out of the prison. And it is the solemne custome of the Fathers when they cite any thing out of the Apostles writings, to expresse it in these words, <hi>The Apostle teacheth</hi>: yea &amp; S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> ascrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto the Scriptures that they make a man wise.</p>

                        <hi>Ibid num.</hi> 7. All men know that a thing may be related two waies, both by liuely voice and by writing. For as those things which are in the voice are signes of those things which are in the minde: so those things which are in the writing are signes of those which are in the voice.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:23186:58"/>
And therefore the same is both waies equally signified or related.</p>
                     <p>Ibid. cap. 22. num. 2. Because the liuely voice is vsed to no other end, saue to expresse the meaning of the spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and Scripture doth evidently expresse the meaning of God speaking vnto vs: therefore in this respect it is false that the Scriptures are dumb. For we no lesse vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that a man is justified by Faith when wee read it in Paul, then when Paul himselfe pronounced it with his liuely voice.</p>
                     <p>Lib. 6. cap. 5. num. 7. The written word is distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed from the word preached by no substantiall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. For they differ neither <hi>in specie, nor in genere, nor in number,</hi> but only in accident—So, for example, that Sermon which first S. <hi>Peter</hi> made vnto the <hi>Iewes</hi> after the gift of the holy Ghost, differeth, not from that which we read Act. 2. related by S. Luke, saue only as writing is not a liuely voice: yet because writing is no other then the image of a liuely voice, so little difference letteth not but that I may affirme the Sermon which I there read to bee the same which S. <hi>Peter</hi> then made. —Wherefore if it be the same Sermon in number, why may not the same bee affirmed of the same? and I truely avouch it to bee read in S. <hi>Luke, Hauing heard these things they were pricked in heart?</hi> These things, I say, which both <hi>Peter</hi> then deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by liuely voice, and now S. <hi>Luke</hi> representeth vnto vs.</p>

For if you regard the <hi>Matter,</hi> it containes <hi>Doctrines</hi> of highest nature and consequence, as being the very foundation of the <hi>Churches</hi> happinesse, and the anchor of all her hope.

                  <p>The serious and due consideration of all which, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the vnspeakable benefit that might grow to the people of <hi>God</hi> by the <hi>right dividing</hi> and handling there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, hath at length ouercome and perswaded me, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take at times the interpretation of this whole Chapter in this place. That so, if it please <hi>God,</hi> before I sing my <hi>nunc dimittis,</hi> I may with these treasures satisfie some part of the debt I owe therevnto both for my birth &amp; breeding. And because these first words now read seeme vnto mee not vnfitting the present occasion, or to succeed what I haue already deliuered vpon the like occasions: I haue thought good at this time to make entrance therevpon, &amp; so as it is in the proverb, <hi>Vnâ fideliâ duos dealbare parietes,</hi> to dispatch two businesses at once. For hauing hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vindicated the <hi>Dignitie</hi> of the <hi>Ministrie</hi> from the <hi>Contempt</hi> whereto it is subject, by prescribing a soueraign <hi>Remedie</hi> &amp; <hi>Defensatiue</hi> against it, as also hauing demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated the power and efficacie of <hi>Preaching,</hi> even of that which is only by <hi>Reading,</hi> which is the first office of the <hi>Ministery</hi>: method and order would that in the next place I speake of <hi>Prayer,</hi> which is the second. And herevnto am I also invited by this Text. For, to forbeare further prefacing, this seuenteenth <hi>Chapter</hi> containeth in it a most heauenly and divine <hi>Prayer,</hi> which our blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> and <hi>Mediator</hi> addresseth vnto his <hi>Father</hi> in behalfe of <hi>Christ mysticall,</hi> as the <hi>Fathers</hi> tearme it: that is, the whole <hi>Church</hi> consisting both of <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Members.</hi> The <hi>Parts</hi> thereof are two, a short <hi>Preface</hi> prefixed by S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:23186:61"/>
the <hi>Corps</hi> or body of the <hi>Prayer.</hi> The <hi>Preface</hi> is my <hi>Text,</hi> wherein relation is made of an <hi>Act</hi> invested with certaine <hi>circumstances.</hi> The <hi>Act</hi> is <hi>Prayer.</hi> The <hi>Circumstances</hi> are three, <hi>Quis, Quando, Quomodo. Quis,</hi> the <hi>Orator</hi> who prayes: <hi>Iesus, These things spake Iesus and lift vp his eyes. Quando,</hi> when he prayes, <hi>after he had spoken these things: These things spake Iesus and then lift vp his eyes. Quomodo,</hi> after what manner he prayed. The <hi>Manner</hi> is externall, and standeth in two things, <hi>in gestu oculorum,</hi> and <hi>in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone oris.</hi> In the <hi>Gesture</hi> of the <hi>Eyes, He lifted vp his eyes vnto heaven</hi>: in the <hi>Speech</hi> of his <hi>Mouth, He said.</hi> Of these things breefely &amp; plainely, as it shall please God to assist.</p>
                  <p>Of all duties vniversally required of all men, <hi>Prayer</hi> seemes to mee the most noble. So noble that by it all the whole worship and service of <hi>God,</hi> is in <hi>Scripture</hi> vsually denominated. And although the <hi>Houses of God</hi> be conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to other vses as well as it: yet are they not called <hi>Houses</hi> of <hi>Preaching,</hi> or <hi>Houses</hi> of <hi>Sacraments,</hi> but <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories</hi> or <hi>Houses of Praier.

                  <p>It is a <hi>Fundamentall article of the Christian Faith</hi> that in <hi>Christ</hi> there are two distinct <hi>Natures,</hi> his <hi>Divinity</hi> &amp; his <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity</hi>: &amp; that both these concurre to the constitution of one <hi>Person God-man.</hi> Whence it followeth that the <hi>Agent</hi> or <hi>Principle</hi> which acteth all the workes of <hi>Mediation,</hi> is but one by reason of the <hi>Vnitie</hi> of the <hi>Person,</hi> even <hi>Christ God-man:</hi> according to that protrite <hi>Maxime, Actiones sunt suppositorum,</hi> all actions issue and proceed from the <hi>Subiect,</hi> or <hi>person.</hi> Howbeit seeing the <hi>Person</hi> alwaies worketh by his <hi>Natures,</hi> and they, as wee haue said, in <hi>Christ</hi> are two: it followeth by reason of this <hi>Dualitie,</hi> that there are two distinct <hi>Principles</hi> by <hi>which Christ</hi> worketh or mediateth, according to that other rule in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Natura est principium motus &amp; quietis, nature is the principle both of rest and motion.</hi> This for further illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be exemplified in <hi>Humane actions.</hi> For as it is <hi>Man,</hi> or the <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> consisting of <hi>Soule</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> that vnderstandeth, reasoneth, moueth, speaketh, yet it is the <hi>Soule by which</hi> he vnderstandeth and reasoneth, the <hi>Body</hi> by which he moueth and speaketh: so in the actions of <hi>Mediation,</hi> it is <hi>Christ God-man</hi> that worketh them all, yet some by his <hi>Godhead,</hi> and some by his <hi>Manhood.</hi> Here therefore are wee to distinguish.

                  <p>The next circumstance is <hi>Quando,</hi> when hee prayes: it was after he had spoken these things. <hi>These things spake Iesus, and lift vp his eyes and said.</hi> So that first hee <hi>spake these things,</hi> and then <hi>lifted vp his eyes and said. He spake these things.</hi> What things? If it shall please you to reflect a little vpon the three former Chapters, you shall readily vnderstand what they are Our <hi>Saviour</hi> hauing a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his passion celebrated the <hi>Passeover</hi> with his <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> and immediatly vpon it instituted the blessed <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> of his <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> knowing that the time of his departure was neere at hand: out of the abundance of his loue towards them, he holds them together, and in the meane season delivers vnto them matters of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous consequence both for their edification and conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. For hauing acquainted them with his departure, as also the great sorrowes and afflictions that would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them after his ascention: he telleth them that this notwithstanding they ought rather to reioyce then bee dismaied. For he goes to prepare a mansion for them in his <hi>Fathers</hi> house, that he will not leaue them as <hi>Orphans</hi> but send the <hi>Comforter</hi> vnto them, who shall abide with them for ever, that he will leaue his <hi>Peace</hi> with them, and <hi>whatsoever they shall aske the Father in his name shall bee granted vnto them.</hi> Meane while that they continue in his loue, and testifie the same by keeping his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, abiding in him, &amp; louing one another. As for him, he will see them again, &amp; replenish their hearts with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting

And albeit by the imminent tempest or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, they may for a time be scattered, yet let them not be ouermuch discomforted, for he hath overcome the world, and after a while he will returne againe, and take them home vnto himselfe for 'evermore.

                  <p>But I beseech you, beloued brethren, <hi>tandem hoc aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> let vs at length attend the businesse which <hi>Christ</hi> hath charged vs withall. What errand hee hath put into our mouthes, that and no other let vs freely deliuer. And let vs striue to deliuer it in such <hi>manner</hi> as may make most to our end, that is, the building vp of men in their most holy <hi>Faith.</hi> This shall we the better doe, if we looke vnto <hi>Christ,</hi> and what forme he vsed. A better precedent can we not possibly follow: <hi>for neuer spake man as he did.</hi> Him did the holy Apostles make their patterne, and by vertue thereof converted the world vnto the <hi>Christian Faith.</hi> If we looke vnto any other, and for the pleasing of them forme our <hi>Sermons</hi> after the humour of those whose hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour we should rectifie: neither shall we please God, nor happily in the end them. A certaine <hi>Painter</hi> hauing with all his skill drawne two pictures as like as possibly hee could, reserued the one in his chamber, and set forth the other on his stall to the view and censure of all that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by: and whatsoeuer they misliked he would with his pencill alter according to their iudgement vntill it was growne every way deformed. At length setting forth his other picture by it, and the people commending it as an exquisite peece, &amp; condemning the other as a deformed monster: yet that, quoth hee, I drew according to your judgement, this according to my owne art and skill. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely, certainely if we shall attend the seuerall censures of our auditors, and patch vp <hi>Sermons</hi> according to their
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:23186:67"/>
liking, monstrous and enormious must they needs bee. Much better were it therefore by our owne art, our art being learned from the example of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> to frame all our <hi>Sermons</hi>: so shall wee gaine many soules vnto Christ, and purchase to our selues true praise with <hi>God,</hi> and in the consciences of all good men. What though this way we cannot make so much shew of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and eloquence? Yet therein shall we be like the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle S. Paul, whose preaching was not in the entising words of mans wisdome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.4.</note> 
                     <hi>but in demonstration of the spirit.</hi> Yea like vnto <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe, <hi>who though hee were rich, yet made himselfe poore, that he might make many rich.</hi> In a word,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4.7.</note> let vs duly remember that although we be <hi>dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of heavenly treasures, yet is it the pleasure of God, wee haue them in earthen vessels, that the excellencie of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er may be of God and not of vs.</hi> But of what Iesus spake enough.</p>
                  <p>After he had spoken these things, then hee <hi>lift vp his eyes</hi> and prayed. Not but that without <hi>Prayer</hi> he was able to effect what he prayed for. For being perfect <hi>God,</hi> and the absolute dispencer of all grace, wee cannot without fearefull impiety thinke, that out of <hi>infirmitie</hi> he seekes that by request which of himselfe he could not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish. No, but as <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, though he were <hi>Potestatis author,</hi> Lord of power: yet would be <hi>Obedientiae Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister,</hi> the teacher of obedience, by due performing his owne dutie. For, as we haue said, he was a <hi>Priest</hi>: and the duties of <hi>Priesthood</hi> are three, <hi>Docere, Orare, Sacrificare,</hi> to teach,<note place="margin">Ioh. 17.8.</note> to pray, to sacrifice. As for the first, he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready carefully taught them, and giuen them the words which his <hi>Father</hi> gaue him. As touching the third, hee was now ready to offer vp himselfe as a propitiatory sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:23186:68"/>
for the sinnes of the world: for so saith he by and by,<note place="margin">Ib. v. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Father the houre is come.</hi> Betwixt these two <hi>intercedit intercessio,</hi> he maketh humble suit that both the one and the other might be effectuall to the eternall saluation of all those whom his <hi>Father</hi> had chosen out of the world and giuen vnto him. And thus as in <hi>Christs Priesthood,</hi> so also in his practise, <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> were vsually ioyned together.</p>
                  <p>What <hi>Christ</hi> therefore hath conioyned let no man dare to put asunder.<note place="margin">Act. 6.4.</note> The dispensation of the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> are by the ioint testimonie of all the <hi>Apostles,</hi> the two principall offices of the <hi>Ministery.</hi> Hardly therefore can they bee divorced without maiming or mangling thereof. As in <hi>Preaching</hi> we are the mouth of <hi>God</hi> vnto the people: so by Prayer ought we to bee the mouth of the people vnto God. By the one we teach them the will of <hi>God</hi>: by the other we blesse them in the name of God. As we are bound to plant and water by <hi>Preaching</hi>: so are we by <hi>Prayer</hi> to mediate vnto God for increase. For that will affect but coldly, except this quicken and inflame it.

they heare may be <hi>even the savour of life vnto life</hi> vnto them. This condemneth all those, who either out of a disrespect of <hi>Preaching</hi> are all for <hi>Prayer,</hi> such as were the ancient <hi>Euchetae,</hi> and too many also amongst vs now adayes: or out of a contempt of <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> are all for <hi>Preaching,</hi> seldome presenting themselues in the <hi>Church</hi> vntill the <hi>Preacher</hi> be in the Pulpit. No marvell if the <hi>Hearing</hi> of the one be fruitlesse, seeing they despise the <hi>Prayers of the Church</hi> by which the blessing is obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: and if the <hi>Prayer</hi> of the other be vneffectuall, seeing they little regard <hi>Preaching</hi> by which it is to be guided.</p>
                  <p>But here happily it will be demanded, whether of the twaine <hi>Preaching</hi> or <hi>Prayer</hi> is the more noble. A questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on much debated of late, and with too much faction and vehemence. Wherevnto this I haue to say, that if the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison be intended betweene <hi>Preaching</hi> and the <hi>Prayer</hi> of private men: without doubt <hi>Preaching</hi> is the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. For it is publike, and therefore more profitable. A publike embassage from <hi>God,</hi> and therefore more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable then a private supplication vnto <hi>God.</hi> To say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the more solemne promise made vnto it, of <hi>shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as the brightnesse of the firmament,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 12.3.</note> 
                     <hi>and the starres for ever and ever.</hi> Yea but <hi>Preaching</hi> is subordinate to <hi>Prayer:</hi> and the end is more worthie then that which is subordinate thereto. Nay but it is preordinate rather, as the <hi>Intelligences</hi> are to their orbs, or <hi>Prudence</hi> vnto ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous actions. Or if it be subordinate, yet is it in order to the chiefest good: as the kingly office is vnto meaner trades for the publike weale, and the <hi>Mediation of Christ</hi> to the <hi>salvation</hi> of man for the glory of Gods grace, which yet are not therefore inferiour. But if the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be of <hi>Preaching,</hi> and the <hi>publike prayer of the Church,</hi>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:23186:69"/>
God forbid that I should set or foment any such quarrell betweene them. By the eager preferring of the one vnto the other, both may easily be vilified. The overmagni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of <hi>Prayer</hi> hath heretofore shut <hi>Preaching</hi> out of the <hi>Church:</hi> and the oueraduancing of <hi>preaching</hi> hath almost excluded <hi>prayer.</hi> And it may be it is <hi>Lasinesse</hi> that spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth so much for all <hi>praying</hi>: and <hi>vaineglory</hi> that is so earnest for all <hi>preaching.</hi> But dares any man thus quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell the <hi>prophecie</hi> and <hi>Intercession</hi> of Christ? I trow no: for they are both alike infinite in worth and dignitie. <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>prayer</hi> are answerable vnto them: why then should we imagine such an inequality betweene them? If when we <hi>preach</hi> we speake in <hi>Gods</hi> name vnto the people: when we Pray we speake in <hi>Christs</hi> name vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>God</hi> for the people. They are not subordinate one vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other: but both coordinate vnto the same maine end. Ioyned together they are, as it were, a familiar <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi> betweene God and vs: wherein God discouereth his will vnto vs, and we say with S. <hi>Augustine, Da quod jubes, &amp; jube quod vis,</hi> giue grace to doe what thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandest, and command what thou wilt. They are the <hi>Angels</hi> of <hi>Iacobs</hi> ladder: our <hi>Prayers</hi> are <hi>Angels</hi> ascending vp vnto God for vs, and our <hi>Sermons</hi> are <hi>Angels</hi> descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding downe with a blessing from God vpon vs. In a word they are both necessary, and of singular vse in their place: and therefore let neither be vndervalued, but both haue their due honour. So shall God bee glorified in his <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi>: and we enioy the benefit intended to vs by them. But of the second circumstance when hee prayed, so much.</p>
                  <p>The third and last is <hi>Quomodo, How,</hi> and in what <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> he prayed. The <hi>Manner</hi> here expressed is onely <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall.</hi>

For he is the <hi>tryer and searcher of the reynes,</hi> and iudgeth not of the heart by the outward appearance, but of the outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance by the heart. Vnto these <hi>Hypocrites</hi> that dissemble both with God and man, and who loue to take religion on them, but not to haue it in them: giue me leaue to say in the words of S. <hi>Chrysostome. O Hypocrite, if it bee good to be good, why wilt thou not be that which thou wilt seeme to be? And if it be evill to be evill, why wilt thou bee that which thou wilt not seeme to be? If it be good to seeme to be good, it is better to be so: if it be evill to seeme to be evill, it is worse to be so.

                  <p>A certaine <hi>Separatist</hi> from this <hi>Gesture</hi> collecteth thus, <hi>yee must lift vp your eyes, therefore ye may not pray on a booke.</hi> Must lift vp? what necessity I pray? Did our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> forget himselfe when he fell on his face? Or the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican</hi> doe amisse when he stood aloofe off, <hi>not daring to lift vp his eyes to Heaven?</hi> Certainly which way soever the <hi>Eye</hi> looketh, <hi>Sursum Corda</hi>; the lifting vp of the heart is the sacrifice which God accepteth. But what? is it vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly vnlawfull to pray on a booke? why then haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and Godly men compiled so many bookes of <hi>Prayer</hi> to this end? and what vniformity is there like to be if in the publike <hi>Liturgy</hi> there be not a certaine forme of <hi>Praier?</hi> But <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>God of order not confusion</hi>: and will they nill they, to pray devoutly on a booke, is more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing vnto <hi>God,</hi> then their proud and schismaticall praying without booke.</p>
                  <p>From this <hi>lifting vp of the eyes,</hi> wee may with better reason learne, when we make our addresses vnto <hi>God,</hi> to abandon earth, and to entertaine nothing but heauenly cogitations. The naturall erection of our countenances in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates, both where our <hi>Hopes</hi> should lye, and with what contemplation our minds should continually be taken vp. To bend our eyes toward heauen, and fixe our hearts vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, is a fouler solecisme in religion, then that stage-player committed in action, who when he said <hi>O heaven,</hi> pointed to the earth, and when <hi>O earth</hi> pointed vnto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <hi>Eies</hi> likewise that are vnchast &amp; full of lust, how dare they looke vp vnto that holy place, or that holy one that dwelleth therein?

throughout all generations for ever more. But I presse this point no further. All which hath beene said touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, I thus apply.</p>
                  <p>First it maketh for the comfort of plaine and simple, yet honest minded people, that although they haue but little skill to set words, and formally to deliver their minds: yet their <hi>Mentall Prayers</hi> and short <hi>Eiaculations</hi> are pleasing and acceptable vnto <hi>God.</hi> God forbid it should be otherwise. For in the approach of death when sicknesse hath sealed vp our lips, or in the time of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when tyrants bereaue vs of our tongues: haue we to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the losse of speech lost also ability to <hi>pray</hi>? No verily. For though with <hi>Moses</hi> wee s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y nothing, yet our thoughts may cry so loud in the eares of God, that he may say vnto vs as sometimes hee did vnto <hi>Moses, Quid clamas ad me,</hi> why dost thou crie vnto me? <hi>Multi sonant voce, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> with their voice that are dumb in their heart. And the contrarie thereof is as true, <hi>Multi sonant corde &amp; voce muti sunt,</hi> many are silent with their lips, yet loud with their affections. The common rime, though it bee not very elegant, yet carries good sense with it, <hi>Non vox sed votum, non cordula musica sed cor, non clamans sed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans cantat in aure Dei</hi>; not the voice but the vow, not the harp but the heart, not lowing but louing musicke for Gods eares.</p>
                  <p>Secondly it serueth for instruction, that although <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall prayer</hi> may be available without <hi>vocall:</hi> yet is not <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> so without <hi>Mentall.</hi> For as the body without the soule, so words without concurrence of affection are dead. <hi>The Iewes drew neere vnto God with their mouth, &amp; honoured him with their lips: but the heart being removed

                     <note place="margin">Mat. 6.7.</note> Such are all they, who pray in a language they know not: like vnto <hi>Parrats,</hi> or the <hi>Cardinalls Iay,</hi> that could repeat the whole Creed, but vnderstood never a word thereof. A thing vtterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to nature, to <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the practise of all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity: and is rather the dotage of a drunken braine, then the serious exercise of true piety. Such also are all they who vnderstand, but attend not what they say: suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their thoughts to range about impertinent businesses, as if a little lippe labour were enough for God.

                  <p>Lastly it may serue for direction how &amp; in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to mould and forme our <hi>Praying.</hi> For as our <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> so our <hi>Praying</hi> also must be conformed to his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Now if you please to search into it, you shall finde this <hi>Prayer,</hi> for the <hi>Matter</hi> most heavenly, for the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,</hi> most orderly, for the <hi>words</hi> most expresse and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant, and for the <hi>length,</hi> no way tedious, as wherein is, to vse the words of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

How acceptable would they then be to him to whom they are addressed? But indeed
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:23186:73"/>
wee imitate it not as wee ought. For on the one side, some of vs present vnto <hi>God,</hi> I know not what curious contriuing of words: as if he were sooner to be taken with the froth of humane wit, then with <hi>Christian</hi> gravity and simplicity. Others on the other side, and those God wot sillie ones, though they know neither what to say nor how; yet least they should seeme destitute of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> they presume on the sudden, without any medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to poure out whole floods of words without one drop of sense, &amp; spinning out their prayers to an enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous length, forgetting that <hi>God</hi> being aboue in heaven, &amp; themselues here on earth, their words should bee both weighty and few. Would a man preferre a petition to his <hi>Prince,</hi> without due consideration of all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand? But these loue to be too homely and familiar with <hi>God</hi>: and I cannot better compare them then to little children, who would faine tell a tale to Father or Mother, not knowing either what it is, or how to vtter it. My ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice vnto these should be, first that they would no longer overweene themselues, mistaking the <hi>Lips of Calues</hi> for the <hi>Calues of the lips.</hi> Then, that vpon knowledge of their owne inability, they content themselues with short <hi>Eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations,</hi> and such <hi>Prayers</hi> as graue and learned men haue provided for them. Lastly, that <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie</hi> be their ordinary <hi>Prayers.</hi> For besides <hi>Mentall</hi> and <hi>Vocall,</hi> there is also <hi>Vitalis Oratio</hi> the <hi>Prayer</hi> of a godly life: which cries as loud vnto <hi>God</hi> for a blessing, as <hi>Abels</hi> murder, or notorious sins doe for vengeance. Without which though a man roare like <hi>Stentor,</hi> and multiply words as the sand: <hi>God</hi> turneth the deafe eare, and will not vouchsafe to heare him. But of this, as also of the whole <hi>Preface</hi> thus much.</p>

For vnto these three heads as I conceaue, the whole prayer may conveniently bee reduced. Of them therefore in order, as it shall please God to assist.

Yet notwithstanding seeing the <hi>Person</hi> is but one, &amp; the <hi>Humane nature</hi> subsisteth not of it selfe, but only in the <hi>Son of God,</hi> &amp; by his <hi>Subsistance</hi>: it is the first <hi>Person</hi> in the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and he alone who is the <hi>Father of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> Howbeit the <hi>Natures</hi> being not one and the same, but differing, he is <hi>Sonne</hi> vnto his <hi>Father,</hi> not by one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but by a double <hi>Filiation.</hi> As he is the <hi>Word,</hi> by way of <hi>Naturall Generation,</hi> begotten from all <hi>Eternity</hi> of the <hi>Substance</hi> of his <hi>Father.</hi> Of his <hi>Substance,</hi> whereby he is <hi>Consubstantiall</hi> and <hi>Coessentiall</hi> with him, <hi>God of God

For it is now high time to be at downe <hi>Popery</hi> by all meanes, it being of late growne too too impudent, as hauing beene but too much countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. <hi>Angells</hi> and <hi>Saints departed,</hi> say <hi>Papists,</hi> may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon. <hi>May be</hi>? and why not <hi>must be?</hi> Forsooth, howsoever they would faine haue the vulgar sort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it, yet dare not the learned among them affirme it to be necessary. And they haue reason. For were it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, either it must be because we are so commanded, or for that without it wee cannot obtaine our end, namely grace and assistance in all our needs. But commandement we haue none. If we haue, let them shew it, together with promise of impetration if wee call vpon them, or of commination if we neglect it. But this they neither doe nor can shew. The fittest place for it, if any such were, had beene where our Saviour the best Doctor teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs how to pray.

Now as it is not necessary in regard of commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so neither is it in respect of the end.

By the intercession and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi> This I trust they will not deny to be of it selfe sufficient every way.

For to this end three things are necessarilie requisite, particular knowledge of all our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ready will to helpe, and power enabling them to helpe vs. First I say <hi>Knowledge,</hi> not of the state of the Church militant in generall (for such we deny not vnto the Saints departed, much lesse vnto the Angels whom <hi>God</hi> hath appointed to be the Gardians of his chosen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:23186:77"/>
but of vs all, and all our actions in particular, yea of the secret cogitations of the heart, and the inward sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thereof. For <hi>Prayer</hi> is not alwaies <hi>Vocall,</hi> but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Mentall</hi> only,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 13.25.</note> such as was that of <hi>Hannah</hi>:<note place="margin">Rom. 8.25.</note> and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times consisteth of such groanes and sighes as cannot bee vttered. And when it is vttered &amp; becomes <hi>Vocal,</hi> speech and whatsoeuer is externall is but the carcase thereof, the life and soule thereof is the internall truth of the heart, it being nothing else but a powring out of the soule or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of the heart before <hi>God.</hi> Which being so, I would faine learne,<note place="margin">Psal. 2.8.</note> if <hi>God</hi> only be <gap reason="foreign">

They may perhaps say, <hi>This people approacheth with their lips,</hi> but whether the heart be neere or farre off, that is beyond their skill. So is it also particularly to know the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward state, and to heare the <hi>Vocall Prayers</hi> of all men wheresoever throughout the whole world. For they are not as <hi>God</hi> present at once every where, but as creatures bounded and measured by time and place: so that at one time they cannot occupie more then one place, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently cannot take notice of all what is done at the same time in every place. True it is the blessed Angels of <hi>God</hi> sometimes attend vpon vs here on earth; but ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily they wait vpon the throne of <hi>God</hi> in heaven. When they are sent, with any message they come vnto vs: and when they haue done their errand they returne againe. So that as well ascending as descending <hi>Iacobs</hi> ladder,<note place="margin">Gen. 28.12.</note> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe we know when any of them come vnto vs, or
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:23186:78"/>
how long they stay with vs, neither doe themselues al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies know in what state we are, or what wee pray for in particular. As for <hi>soules</hi> departed, as it is no part of their office to encomber themselues with our businesses:<note place="margin">Esa. 63.16.</note>
                     <note place="margin">2 Reg. 22.20.</note> so if we may beleeue <hi>Scripture</hi> they haue no particular know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them,<note place="margin">Iob. 14.21.</note> yea they are often taken from among vs,<note place="margin">Eccl. 9.5.</note> to the end they may not be troubled with them.<note place="margin">Psal. 146.4.</note> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed not knowing of themselues as being absent, if they haue any such knowledge it must needs be by revelation or relation from others. Is it from the <hi>Angells</hi> then? But they know not all our needs, as not being alwaies with vs. And what a compasse is it, that the <hi>Angells</hi> come downe hither, and then returne backe againe, to acquaint the <hi>Saints</hi> with our needs, that they may pray for vs? Is it from <hi>Soules</hi> newly arrived? Surely they at their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are more carefull of themselues and their owne fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture state, then inquisitiue after the state of others. And the knowledge they carry hence with them can be but of a few things neere at hand which they haue seene and heard, not which were farre distant, or of all wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and whensoeuer done. Besides, what a dreame is it, that those ancient <hi>Saints</hi> should then only interceede for vs, when by some of these new comers they are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly informed of vs? whence is it then? Forsooth from divine revelation? what? speciall and particular then when we pray?<note place="margin">De beat Sanc. l. 1. c. 20.</note> Nor so neither, saith <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> For then the <hi>Church</hi> would not so boldly say vnto the <hi>Saints Pray for vs,</hi> but sometimes remember to begge of God that he would reveale our prayers vnto them. Neither can a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son so readily be yeelded why the <hi>Saints</hi> before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Christ</hi> were not called vpon, seeing <hi>God</hi> might as well haue revealed the <hi>Churches</hi> prayers vnto those then,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:23186:78"/>
as to these now, what revelation then? That whereby in the glasse of the <hi>Trinity</hi> they see all whatsoever may any way belong vnto them.<note place="margin">Mor. l. 12. c. 13</note> Then belike not all things, as <hi>Gregory</hi> saith: else what needed this restriction?

                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.22.</note> and whatsoever is Christs belong vnto them as being in Christ: then seeing all that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto them, they see therein all things which they will none of. But the truth is, this devise of the glasse is but a poore shift. For the essence of <hi>God</hi> is most simple and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, and varieth not as things here varie. Neither is it, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> saith a <hi>necessarie</hi> but a <hi>voluntary</hi> glasse, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting not all that it knowes, but what it pleaseth to make knowne: which vpon the matter is no other revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then that which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe reiects. By all which it appeares that nor <hi>Angells</hi> nor <hi>Saints</hi> haue suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient meanes of particular knowledge.</p>
                  <p>As is their knowledge, so is their desire: for the will followes the direction of the vnderstanding, wherefore there is no particular knowledge, neither can there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular will. That the <hi>Saints</hi> who are <gap reason="foreign">

we find none. True it is the <hi>Angells</hi> are <hi>Ministring spirits,</hi> and as it pleaseth <hi>God</hi> are sent forth to doe him service here below. But which of them, and for whom, and about what businesse, and when, and where, &amp; how long, and the like, are circumstances hidden and concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from vs. Neither are they all employed in every bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, but when and where it pleaseth <hi>God.</hi> Whence it followeth that where they are not employed they haue no particular will to helpe. As for the <hi>Saints</hi> departed, wee read not of any commandement they haue to attend vs or our affaires. Nay we read they are taken away, to the end they should not be troubled with them.

                  <p>Now wanting both knowledge and will, to what end were <hi>ability,</hi> had they any? But indeed sufficient power they want also.

For ability to perfome so much belongs only vnto him who knowes all, is every where, and to whom nothing is impossible: and therefore not vnto the creature, which being of a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and limited nature cannot attend so many, so divers, and so distant businesses otherwise then successiuely. And thus seeing <hi>Angells and Saints</hi> neither haue particular knowledge of our estates, nor ready will to helpe, nor sufficient power enabling them to helpe: it followeth that to pray vnto them must needs be vaine and so no way Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or <hi>Profitable.</hi>

                  <p>One thing more I haue yet to say before I leaue this point: namely that against the <hi>Invocation of Saints</hi> wee haue the prescription of a very long time on our side. For in the old Testament and during the space of well neere four thousand yeares we haue no warrant at all for it. <note place="margin">Praef. de eccl. triumph. &amp; l. 1. c. 19.</note>Nay <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe (howsoever our adversaries to bleare the eye of the world make a flourish to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie) expressely confesseth that the <hi>Spirits</hi> of the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> before the comming of <hi>Christ</hi> were not so worshipped and called vpon, as the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> now are, because as yet they were detained in those infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall prisons where they had not the beatificall sight of God. Now if the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> then saw the face of God as farre forth as the <hi>Saints</hi> doe now (as indeede they did) the argument is so much the stronger, if yet all that while they were never called vpon. In the new testament like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we finde no warrant for it even by their owne confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. And <hi>Salmeron</hi> the <hi>Iesuite</hi> rendreth reasons thereof. For, saith he, the <hi>Iew</hi> that never had called vpon any of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:23186:80"/>
the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> or <hi>Prophets</hi> would hardly haue beene drawne to pray vnto those newer Saints: &amp; the <hi>Gentiles</hi> would haue thought that insteed of those many Gods which they had forsaken, a multitude of other Gods had beene put vpon them. As for the times after Christ and his Apostles, it was long before it crept into the Church: and when it entred, it was but the opinion of some pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men, and not the publike doctrine of the Church. All the Fathers which proued the Deitie of the Sonne &amp; of the holy Ghost by this dutie of <hi>Invocation,</hi> must needs if they will not contradict themselues be against it. So must they also (and they are not the least or meanest part of them) who held that the <hi>Faithfull hence</hi> departed are not admitted into heauen, but continue elsewhere in some secret receptacles without the vision of God vntill the day of iudgement. For vpon that vision, even in the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our aduersaries, their particular knowledge of all things here done on earth dependeth, vpon this againe their <hi>Invocation.</hi> In a word whensoeuer or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it began, as it grew on, so was it still opposed, and neuer gate publike strength vntill the blinde times of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition overswaied true devotion.</p>
                  <p>The cafe then standing thus, that <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> is neither <hi>necessary,</hi> nor <hi>pious,</hi> nor <hi>profitable,</hi> but rather <hi>impious</hi> and extreamely dangerous, as being derogatory to the glory of God &amp; the honour of <hi>Christs Mediation,</hi> and that no ground or warrant at all can bee found for it, either in the old or new Testament, or in the writings and practise of those holy <hi>Fathers</hi> who flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when the Church was in her primitiue puritie: the case I say thus standing, our safest course will be to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the precedence and direction of our blessed Saviour

and with him to addresse our selues vnto our heauenly Father, and to none other. It is he alone who at all times can both heare and helpe. Neither is he more able then ready and willing to grant our requests, if we come vnto him in his sonnes name. Night and day he stretcheth out his armes towards vs, he invites vs with all louingnesse to come vnto him, hee chargeth and commandeth vs in all our needs and necessities to direct our prayers immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly vnto him. Let vs not therefore sollicite any other mediators or spokesmen for vs, as if we doubted of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly goodnesse and affection towards vs: but let vs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther come directly <hi>with all boldnesse vnto the throne of grace,</hi>

                     <hi>but as of one, and to thy seed which is Christ.</hi> Now, saith he, <hi>some perhaps will say, if Christ be the seed of Abraham, are we so also? Remember that Christ is the seed of Abraham: and if by this wee also are the seed of Abraham, then are we also Christ.</hi> Vnto this warrant of Scripture adde we the reason thereof: that Christ and his Church being twaine and yet constituting but one mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call body, it is fit the denomination of the whole should be taken from the better and more worthy part, which is Christ, and not the inferiour, which is the Church. But of this by the way.</p>
                  <p>For Christ mysticall then doth our <hi>Saviour</hi> pray: but first for himselfe, and then for his members.

Secondly, hee knew it could not goe well with his Church, vnlesse first it went well with himselfe. For vnder his <hi>Father</hi> he was to be the fountaine of life and grace, the vniversall cause of all good vnto his Church, and to this end was hee to be annointed of the Spirit without stint or measure.<note place="margin">Ps. 133.2.</note> So that vnlesse the ointment be poured vpon <hi>Aarons head, it cannot descend vnto the beard, and from thence vnto the skirts of his garment.</hi>

himselfe, we cannot <hi>of his fulnes receiue either grace for grace</hi> or glory for glory. That therefore it might goe well with vs he prayes first for himselfe. But then in the next place he maketh sute for his Church, as if without her welfare it could not be well with him. For as for her he was incarnate, so without her hee counts himselfe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect. For so it must needs be, if as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

And this you see for <hi>whom</hi> he prayes, as also in what order, &amp; why in such order he prayes for them. Whence briefly we may obserue, first to what height of honour it hath pleased Christ to advance his Church, in that hee hath made her not only Christian by vertue of her <hi>Spirituall vnction,</hi> but also Christ by reason of her <hi>mysticall vnion</hi> with him: then which what higher dignitie? Secondly, that in all things Christ is to be preferred even to our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry liues, yea our soules and their saluation, as <hi>Moses</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> sometime did, because hee is of infinite more worth and desert then all. Thirdly, that Christ is the Principle of all good, and that the life both of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> is to be deriued from him alone. If we seek it from Saints, or Angells, or any other creature, they will but deceaue our hopes in the end, as water torrents that <hi>passe away doe the trauellers of Temah and Sheba.</hi>

of it, and in speech honourable mention. In regard whereof it is defined by some, <hi>Clara cum laude notitia,</hi> an apprehension thereof together with praise: by others <hi>laus consentiens bonorum,</hi> or <hi>vox hominum incorruptè judican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> praise giuen by good men, or the report of them that iudge rightly thereof. Of which againe by and by. Such is Glory. Now to Glorifie imports two acts, the one of <hi>bounty</hi> and liberality, the other of <hi>Iustice.</hi> That whereby Glory is conferred &amp; bestowed where it is not, or is augmented and increased where it is not in the full measure. And so God is said to <hi>glorifie</hi> the creature, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the <hi>Psalmist, Grace and glory God will giue.</hi> This whereby the <hi>glorie</hi> that is is acknowledged &amp; ascribed vnto the thing that is <hi>glorious,</hi> yea whereby it is made knowne &amp; manifest to others to the praise and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thereof. And so the creature is said to <hi>glorifie God.</hi> And in this latter sense wee finde these three words of <hi>Praising, Honouring,</hi> and <hi>Glorifying</hi> in <hi>Scripture</hi> ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be vsed: although in proper speech each haue its se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall and peculiar notion. For <hi>Praising</hi> is that act where by in words we giue testimonie of the vertue or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of a thing. So the <hi>Philosopher, Laus est oratio magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinem virtutis indicans,</hi> praise is a speech declaring the greatnesse of vertue. <hi>Honouring</hi> is an higher degree where by not in words only, but by outward gestures and signes also we testifie of the excellence &amp; goodnesse of a thing. <hi>Glorifying</hi> is the fruit or effect of both. For in praysing by words and honouring by signes wee cause the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and excellencie of a thing to spread it selfe vnto the knowledge of many. Whence insteed of <hi>glorificatio</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers say <hi>clarificatio,</hi> deriuing <hi>gloria</hi> from <hi>clarus,</hi> as if it were <hi>claria,</hi> to import the making of a thing illustrious &amp;

And thus you see in generall both what <hi>glory</hi> is, and what it is to <hi>glorifie:</hi> by which as by a threed we may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be guided to that particular which here our <hi>Saviour craues</hi> when he saith, <hi>Father glorifie thy Sonne.</hi> For vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly he prayes that his father would bestow vpon him what glorie he wanted, if he wanted any: and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of that glorie which already he had, if he had any, or should haue therefore. Wherefore to make all plaine, we will enquire three things. First, What glory he was presently possessed of, secondly, what glory yet he wanted, and thirdly how hee would be glorified. Of these in order, and first of the first.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Christ</hi> now presently was possessed of <hi>glorie,</hi> though haply not as yet in the full measure, cannot bee denied. For although the Prophet say that hee had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>forme,</hi>

                     <hi>&amp; full of grace and truth.</hi> Outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in the eye of naturall men beauty he had none,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.14.</note> he seemed a <hi>Worme</hi> rather then a <hi>Man:</hi> but inwardly and to them that were spirituall hee both was and appeared <hi>glorious, and they beheld his glory, not as of man, but as of the only begotten of the Father.</hi> Omitting therefore this as granted of all hands, let vs rather enquire touching his <hi>glory</hi> what it was. It was double, the <hi>glorie</hi> of his <hi>Person,</hi> and the <hi>glory</hi> of his <hi>Office.</hi> The <hi>glory</hi> of his <hi>Person</hi> againe is double. For being the <hi>word made flesh,</hi> &amp; so consisting of two distinct natures the <hi>Word</hi> and the <hi>Flesh</hi>; though the <hi>Person</hi> be but one, yet is there a twofold <hi>glorie</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:23186:84"/>
one of the <hi>Word,</hi> another of the <hi>Flesh.</hi> The <hi>glorie</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> standeth in two things, first that hee is the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Sonne</hi> of the eternall <hi>Father,</hi> begotten after an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable manner of his owne substance: and therefore <hi>the brightnesse of his glory,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 1 3. &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>and the expresse image of his Person.</hi> A name too excellent for the <hi>Angells</hi> themselues. For neuer did the Father say to any of them <hi>Thou art my sonne this day haue I begotten thee.</hi> Secondly that being so begotten hee is consubstantiall and coequall with his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>: neither <hi>counteth he it robbery to bee equall with him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 2.6.</note> For though he be the <hi>Sonne</hi> and not the <hi>Father,</hi> yet being of the same <hi>Substance</hi> hee is one and the same God with him, and may iustly challenge vnto himselfe the fulnesse of the <hi>Deitie</hi> as farre forth as the <hi>Father.</hi> A glory infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely transcending that of any creature. The <hi>glorie</hi> of his <hi>Flesh</hi> is likewise double, of <hi>Assumption</hi> and <hi>Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Of <hi>Assumption</hi> by which it was taken into the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature. For as soone as it began to haue being in the wombe of the blessed virgin, it was prevented from sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in it selfe, and was drawne into the vnitie of the <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> eternally to subsist therein. The highest dignitie that a creature can aspire vnto. That of <hi>Communication</hi> is whereby glorious things are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated vnto his humane nature. And it is either <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall</hi> or <hi>Habitual. Personall</hi> is that whereby as the nature of man is truely giuen to the <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Sonne,</hi> so the <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Sonne</hi> is truely communicated vnto the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man. Wherevpon because in the <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Sonne</hi> is the fulnesse of all perfection, and all the essentiall attributes of the <hi>Deitie,</hi> as namely <hi>Omniscience, omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, omnipresence,</hi> and the rest: therefore doe wee say that all these attributes and that fulnesse of perfection
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:23186:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>

                  <p>For first seeing <hi>Christ</hi> who cannot be denyed what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he demands hath prayed for his glorification: what vanity is it for any man to thinke or hope that he can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or obscure it? Let <hi>Iewes</hi> persecute him, put him to death, set a watch about his sepulcher to keepe him down: yet can they not let but hee shall reviue and rise againe. Though tyrants by open violence oppose the profession of his name, and <hi>Hereticks</hi> by <hi>Sophistrie</hi> seeke to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it, and <hi>Antichrist</hi> assault it both waies by violence and sophistrie: yet maugre all their cunning and malice his <hi>Father</hi> shall surely <hi>glorifie him.</hi> Yea he is <hi>God manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in the flesh,</hi>

Secondly, the <hi>Glorification</hi> of Christ is the pledge and earnest of our <hi>Glorification.</hi> For had not he risen, ascended and beene receiued vp into glory, neither should wee. The gates of death had beene bard vpon vs, and of heaven shut against vs, &amp; we should haue beene covered with eternall shame and ignominie. But now Christ like another <hi>Sampson</hi> hath broken through the gates of death, our head is risen and wee in him. Hee is ascended and gone from vs, but gone to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a place for vs, that where he is there we may be also,</hi> and

behold that his glory; and beholding it be made like vnto him, bearing his glorious image. For as now because hee is full of grace wee of <hi>his fulnesse receiue even grace for grace</hi>: so being full of glory, of his fulnesse wee shall also receiue even glory for glory. Memorable is that saying of <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De resur. car. c. 51.</note> 
                     <hi>As he hath left vnto vs the earnest of his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, so he hath receiued from vs the earnest of our flesh, and hath caried it into heaven as a pledge that the whole summe shall one day be reduced thither. Rest therefore secure oh flesh and bloud, yee haue livery &amp; seizan of heauen and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God already in Christ.</hi> Thirdly <hi>Christ</hi> so earnestly suing for his Glorification, it is our duty by all meanes both to procure and further his Glory, which if wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe in such sort as his Father doth, yet are wee to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it in such a sort as we may. If not <hi>gloriosum facien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> by bestowing glory vpon him: yet <hi>gloriosum dicendo,</hi> by praising and magnifying his glory. By faith we are to be assured thereof, by confession to acknowledge it, by our holy Christian life to testify that the faith of our hearts and the confession of our mouthes accord and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree together, and as much as lies in vs to labour that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may glorifie <hi>Christ</hi> together with vs. Fourthly and lastly, as <hi>Christ</hi> did so are wee warranted by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to pray for our owne Glorification: that God would be pleased to perfect that <hi>glory</hi> vpon vs which here by <hi>grace</hi> he hath begunne in vs. Hence is it that the <hi>Saints</hi> are said not only to <hi>loue,</hi> but also to <hi>long</hi> for the second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of <hi>Christ,</hi> as knowing that till then it cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: that the <hi>Church</hi> also so earnestly prayes, <hi>Turne my beloued and be like the Roe or young Hart vpon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of Bether,</hi>

                  <p>Now that he may not be denied his request, he presseth his <hi>Father</hi> with sundry weighty and important reasons: all which God willing we will handle in their order. The first is drawen from the circumstance of time, thus, <hi>The houre is come, therefore glorify thy Sonne.</hi> What <hi>Hour?</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the <hi>houre</hi> of his bitter passion.

                     <hi>Loe the houre is at hand, and the sonne of man is betraid into the hands of sinners.</hi> That also of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 8.20.</note> 
                     <hi>They laid not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hands on him, because his houre was not yet come.</hi> And yet more plainely by that of our Sauiour,<note place="margin">Ioh. 12.23.24.27.</note> where hauing said, <hi>the houre is come that the Sonne of man should be glorified,</hi> presently hee speaketh of his death, and addeth, <hi>Father saue mee from this houre, but therefore came I into this houre.</hi> This <hi>Houre</hi> is here by way of eminence called <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>the, or that houre,</hi> both in regard of the great work that was to be performed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as also for that it was long before determined by the <hi>Father</hi> to that worke. But now, saith <hi>Christ,</hi> that hour is come, that is, it is instant and at hand. And so indeed it was. For the same night that hee vttered this prayer hee
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:23186:88"/>
was betraid, and the next day cruelly executed. By which it is evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that he was not ignorant of the <hi>houre,</hi> but as he foreknew it, so he was ready also to enter into it. So that in these two words these three things come to bee consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, the <hi>Houre,</hi> the <hi>worke</hi> of the <hi>houre,</hi> &amp; the <hi>knowledge</hi> he had both of the <hi>Houre</hi> &amp; the <hi>worke</hi> thereof. But before I spake of any of them, it is reason wee should shew the force of <hi>Christs</hi> argument, &amp; how it followes, <hi>The houre of my Passion is now at hand: therefore thou oughtest to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify mee.</hi> Some, as namely those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> make the reason of the sequele to be the merit of his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, for that by it hee should deserue his glory. Now true it is that <hi>Christ</hi> both did and suffered many things worthy of most large and ample reward. Howbeit for ought we can find in <hi>Scripture,</hi> all was for vs with neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of himselfe. There was no perfection but either hee was already possessed of it, or it was now due vnto him by vertue of the <hi>personall vnion.</hi> At the first instant whereof all glorie would haue flowen to his <hi>Humanity,</hi> had it not by speciall dispensation beene staid vntill hee was come to the lowest bottome of his <hi>humiliation.</hi> Which being done, and the stay remoued, it could not but naturally flow vnto him. So that how hee should merit for himselfe cannot well be conceiued without em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of his glorious <hi>Vnion.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 2.8.9.</note> As for those texts they alledge for proofe,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.9.</note> all of them shew rather <hi>ordinem</hi> then <hi>meritum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luc. 24.26.</note> that his glory succeeded his passion, not that his passion merited his glory.<note place="margin">Heb. 1.9.</note> For as touching that to the <hi>Hebrewes, Thou hast loued righteousnesse and hated iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: wherefore God even thy God hath annointed thee with the oile of gladnesse aboue thy fellowes</hi>: if it import merit, it must be of <hi>Vnction</hi> and not of finall <hi>Glorification,</hi> which

they wil none of, &amp; indeed cannot be. For in the very first instant of his assumption, &amp; assoone as the <hi>Humanity</hi> had being, the ointment was poured vpon him, so that it could not possible be preuented by merit.

                     <hi>Christ ought first to suffer, and then to enter into his glory.</hi> And hence also it is that here he saith, <hi>The houre is come, glorifie thy sonne:</hi> as if he should say more fully, thou hast bound thy selfe by promise, yea and by oath too, that when by suffering I shall haue finished the worke of redemption for which thou sentest me, thou wouldest fully satisfie me with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Now the houre of my passion is come, and I am ready and willing to vndergoe it. Remember therefore thy promise and performe it. For vnlesse thou wilt faile of thy word (and fayle of thy word thou canst not, because thou art truth it selfe) thou must needs <hi>glorifie me.</hi> And thus you see both the reason and necessity of the sequele in this <hi>enthymeme.</hi>

                     </gap>, time is that wherein season is: it may not be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but God hath ordained such a time for it as was eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way most seasonable. And truly did S. <hi>Augustin</hi> say, <hi>Omnia proprijs locis &amp; temporibus gessit Saelvator,</hi> our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> acted all things in their proper times and places. Let vs therefore a little more particularly enquire touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this time and season: and here first in what age of the world, secondly in what yeare of his owne age, thirdly and lastly in what time of that yeare he suffered.</p>
                  <p>As touching the age of the world, it was not instantly vpon the creation thereof, nor yet soone vpon the fall of man, but a long time after, euen towards the end of foure-thousand yeares, and the beginning of the last age of the world,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.4.</note> called therefore in Scripture, <hi>the fulnesse of time,</hi> and <hi>the last daies.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 1.2.</note> This time was of old foretold by the Prophets.

                     </gap> nothing at all to be reckoned of. Haply you will demand why it pleased God rather to appoint this time then any other. I answer because this time was of all other the most seasonable &amp; fitting. The time before the fall, and while man stood yet in his integritie could no way be fit. For as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our saith, <hi>He came not to call the iust,</hi> and againe, <hi>the whole need not the Physitian.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 9.15.12.</note> There being therefore as yet no sicknesse nor wound: neither was there any need of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke or salue. Had man persisted in his innocencie, <hi>Christ</hi> had never beene incarnate nor had suffered. To haue suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered soone after the fall would also haue beene very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient. For it was reason that man sinning by pride should haue a time to humble him, to see his miserie, to seeke helpe, and to exercise his faith. The dignitie also of our Saviours person was such, and the worke of <hi>redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> so important, that so much haste could not wel stand with either.<note place="margin">Luc. 18.8.</note> And if Christ suffering so lately shall at his second comming scarce finde faith on the earth: what a scarcity of faith would there haue beene, and how cold would charity haue waxed by this time, had hee suffered so long agoe, and presently vpon the fall? For which cause also it was not to bee deferred vnto the last period of the world, least in the <hi>interim</hi> religion and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God should quite bee extinguished.

the power of God our Saviour might bee praised and spread abroad, our faith exercised and tried not onely in regard of things past and present but future also, and our thankfulnesse testified by our faithfull and diligent ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of him. The duest time therefore was by the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God chosen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Christ</hi> came and suffered nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too soone nor too late, but in that season when both <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> were come to their ripenesse, the one to be broken off by reason of their incredulitie, the other to be grafted in through Gods goodnesse and mercy. For as touching the <hi>Iewes,</hi> they were now growne to such an height of impietie, that as <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith, had the <hi>Romans</hi> neuer so little deferred their desolation, either the earth would haue swallowed them, or a deluge of waters haue drowned them, or fire from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue consumed them, for <hi>Sodom</hi> was never so abominable. As for the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> their fulnesse was now come in, they were growne white and ready for the harvest, and the calling of them so long delayed was now to be commenced. And so much for the age of the world.</p>
                  <p>As touching the yeare of his age wherein hee suffered, it was, if wee may beleeue <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> about the fiftieth, which he voucheth to be an <hi>Apostolicall tradition.</hi> But indeed he is fowly mistaken, as is generally agreed vpon by all. Where by the way may bee obserued what small credit is to be giuen to <hi>Fathers</hi> in point of tradition. The ground of his opinion was that of the <hi>Iewes, Thou are not yet fiftie,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 8.57.</note> 
                     <hi>and hast thou seene Abraham?</hi> But they spake at randome, and after the manner of disputers grant him more then might well be admitted. The common recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued opinion is, that hee suffered being three and thirtie compleate, &amp; in the beginning of his foure and thirtieth.

Howbeit <hi>Scaliger,</hi> and that as it seemes not without good reason, addeth one yeare more, and placeth his <hi>Passion</hi> in the beginning of his fiue and thirtieth.

But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this I will not contend. The oddes of one yeare can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be great. Enquire wee rather why hee suffered at this age. First, because it was vnfit that old age should creepe into that nature which was so neerely vnited vnto the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall sonne of God. Secondly to testifie how dearely he loued vs, that was content then to die for vs when as yet he was in the very flowre and vigor of his age. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, mystically to teach vs, that as hee grew in age and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and then being come to his full consistence and strength declined not: so we should also grow from faith to faith, from grace to grace till we come to our full <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The time of the yeare wherein he suffered was the day of the feast of <hi>Passeouer,</hi> even the fifteenth of the month <hi>Nisan.</hi> For the evening before he eate the <hi>Passeouer</hi> with his Disciples, which by the law of God ought to be done vpon the fourteenth of <hi>Nisan</hi>: &amp; the next day after he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

What then? Did <hi>Christ</hi> as Lord of the <hi>Passeouer</hi> prevent the due day prescribed by his Father? So some say, but very vnprobably. For Christ came to fulfill the law: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without doubt he precisely obserued it. How then? Surely the <hi>Iewes</hi> fayled, not he. For the day of the <hi>Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over</hi> and the weekly <hi>Sabbath</hi> falling immediatly this yeare one after the other, they according to their old cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, translated the <hi>Passeouer</hi> vpon the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued both on one day.

                     </gap> the same day he was created sinned: so the same day after the revolution of some yeares, mans sin by the death of <hi>Christ</hi> was done away, and hee againe created anew. Which if it could clearely and infallibly bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated would argue a speciall providence of God in the dispensation of this day. Adde lastly, that at this time all the <hi>Iewes</hi> wheresoeuer were to appeare at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> &amp; to celebrate this feast before the Lord: and that in this regard also it was fit he should at this time suffer, that more publike notice might be taken thereof, and it the better be divulged and spread abroad. And thus also you see in what time and season of the yeare he suffered.</p>
                  <p>The consideration of this circumstance of time may serue first to convince the <hi>Iewes</hi> of obstinate incredulitie. For if God haue by his eternall decree determined a set houre vnto the comming and suffering of the <hi>Messias,</hi> &amp; that houre be now many hundred of yeares past: then is <hi>Christ</hi> already come, or God fayleth of his purpose. But that such a precise houre was set, and that God cannot fayle of his purpose, the <hi>Iew</hi> knoweth well enough. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate therefore needs must he be, still denying that the <hi>Messias</hi> is come. Secondly it may serue to confirme and settle our <hi>Faith</hi> in the truth of the promised seed. For they that came before or after the appointed houre could
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:23186:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not be the true shepheard, but theeues only and robbers. But <hi>Iesus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Mary</hi> came and suffered in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time, and in him were fulfilled all whatsoever was by the <hi>Prophets</hi> foretold concerning the <hi>Messias.</hi> He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the true <hi>Christ,</hi> neither are wee to looke for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thirdly, not whithstanding this appointed time, wee are to remember for our further consolation, that <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ is yesterday and to day and evermore.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so the vertue of his death and passion reacheth downe to these times also, and evermore will be available to the iustification of a sinner, whosoever shall bee provided of true <hi>Faith</hi> thereby to apprehend it. Fourthly, as vnto this particular of <hi>Christs</hi> passion, so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other things also, as namely our <hi>vocation, conversion &amp; repentance,</hi> hath he appointed a due time. This is called the <hi>acceptable time,</hi> and our <hi>Hodie to day:</hi> which if wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we neglect, we may with <hi>Esau, seeke the blessing with teares,</hi> and never after recover it. Take wee heed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>while it is called to day, that we harden not our hearts,</hi> but harken vnto his voice, and duely obey it that wee may be admitted into his rest. Lastly, as God out of his deepe wisdome, so are wee in imitation of God to doe all things in due season. For as nothing is contented out of its proper place, so nothing is welcome or gratious that is done out of due season. It is not every word how true soever that is <hi>like an apple of gold with pictures of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> but that only which is <hi>Seasonable.</hi> Learned is the tongue of that man that speaketh a word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in fit time: and thrice blessed is hee who <hi>like a tree planted by the rivers of waters bringeth forth his
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:23186:93"/>
fruite in his proper season.</hi> And thus much touching the <hi>time</hi> when Christ suffered.</p>
                  <p>The next point to be considered is the worke of that <hi>houre,</hi> what worke will you say? The bitter passion of our Lord and saviour <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> what <hi>Passion</hi>? The suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of that punishment which was due to sinne for the satisfaction of his <hi>Fathers</hi> iustice. What, was hee a sinner and deserved such punishment? No, by no meanes. For as touching <hi>Originall sinne,</hi> the passage of that was so stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vp in his conception by the Holy Ghost, that it could no way enter into him. And for <hi>Actuall sinne</hi> there was not so much as guile found in his mouth. But hee was to suffer for our <hi>Sinnes,</hi> and to satisfie his Father. We had eaten sower grapes, and his teeth were set on edge, yea but what iustice is this, that <hi>Titius</hi> shall sinne, and <hi>Sempronius</hi> be punished? The cause is not alike. For <hi>Christ</hi> vndertooke to be our <hi>Surety,</hi> and to satisfie all our debts. And to this end the <hi>Word</hi> became <hi>Flesh,</hi> that being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise impassible, hee might in it suffer the punishment due vnto vs. But might not <hi>God</hi> if he had beene so pleased haue vsed some other meanes for the appeasing of his wrath? Yes doubtlesse, for he had abundance of spirit &amp; wisdome. But he chose this as the best course for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of his iustice and mercy: justice in the rigorous exacting of satisfaction for sinne yea even from his owne sonne, mercy in the free pardon of sinne by the death and passion of his sonne. Excellently to this purpose <hi>Camera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censis,</hi> God in the beginning gaue vnto man, <hi>truth</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct him, <hi>iustice</hi> to direct him, <hi>mercy</hi> to preserue him, and <hi>peace</hi> to delight him. But he rebelling against his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, they all fled from him, &amp; returned vnto <hi>God.</hi> Where <hi>iustice</hi> called vpon him for satisfaction, and <hi>truth</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

performance of his word: but <hi>Peace</hi> sought mitigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of wrath, and <hi>mercy</hi> sued for pardon. In this difficulty <hi>wisdome</hi> interposed her selfe, and found out a meanes to content all, namely by the incarnation and suffering of the sonne of <hi>God.</hi> Wherevnto the <hi>Father</hi> yeelding all were soone accorded: and so <hi>mercy and truth met together, and justice and peace kissed each other.</hi> For further ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof it pleased the Father solemnely and vnalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably to decree, that his sonne should suffer in the flesh. Wherevpon our <hi>Saviour</hi> saith it was so determined: and the <hi>Scriptures</hi> as they foretell it, so they affirme that <hi>thus it must be, and that Christ ought to suffer. <note place="margin">Luc. 22.28.</note>

                        <note place="margin">Act. 2.33.</note> And according to this determinate counsell and fore-knowledge of God,</hi> when the houre appointed was come <hi>he was delivered and taken and by wicked hands crucified and slaine.</hi> Of which great worke being now to speake, and to enquire into the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi> fore appointed vnto him by his <hi>Father</hi>; because some extenuate it too much as if he seemed only to suffer, or suffered not what indeed hee did, others againe too much aggravate it as if he suffered the very paines of the damned in hell, wee will as warily and as carefully as we can steere betweene that <hi>Scylla</hi> and this <hi>Charybdis.</hi> And to this end wee will diligently enquire foure things, <hi>the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies or kinde of punishment he suffered, the extention, the intention, and the duration thereof.</hi> And of each of these briefely in a word.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>kind of punishment</hi> was that which was due to sin, and every way equivalent for the expiation thereof: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit so farre forth and no further then was convenient for such a person. First, therefore he suffered not that <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of sinne which is sinne</hi> (for <hi>God</hi> many times and that iustly punisheth one sinne by another) The reason;
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:23186:94"/>
for that then he should haue beene a sinner either by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent or actuall sinne, and so could never haue made sufficient satisfaction for the sinnes of others. Neither secondly did he suffer the <hi>personall punishment</hi> of this or that man, as the gout, the stone, the dropsie, and the like. For he tooke not the person but the nature of man into him: and so made himselfe subiect not to <hi>Personall</hi> but to <hi>Naturall</hi> infirmities only. To say nothing that those paines are many of them so contrary and repugnant one vnto another, as they are incompatible in the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Nor yet thirdly did he suffer those punishments which proceede either from the conscience of inherent sinne, or the eternall continuance of sinne, such as are <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse</hi> and <hi>despaire.</hi> For in him was never any sinne whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Originall</hi> or <hi>Actuall.</hi> Only it was imputed vnto him inasmuch as he vndertooke to satisfy for it. These fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised and excepted all other sorts of <hi>Punishment</hi> were laid vpon him. And because in <hi>Sinne</hi> there is a double act, an Aversion or turning away from God the chiefest good, and a <hi>Conversion</hi> or turning vnto that which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a seeming good, and consequently the desert of a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Punishment,</hi> the one of <hi>losse</hi> to be depriued of the true good, in regard of the <hi>Aversion,</hi> the other of <hi>sence,</hi> to feele smart both in body and soule in regard of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version: our blessed Lord and Sauiour suffered both. The <hi>Punishment of Losse,</hi> being in regard of present comfort and ioy left vnto himselfe and in a sort forsaken of his <hi>Father,</hi> of which againe anon in the due place. The pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of <hi>Sence,</hi> for he felt during the while extreame both torment and paine outwardly in the <hi>body,</hi> and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and anguish, inwardly in the <hi>Soule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Extension</hi> whereof was also exceeding generall:
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:23186:94"/>
for he suffered from all that any way could afflict him, and in all whatsoever belonged vnto him. From his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> therefore he suffered, who for a time abandoned him and delivered him into the hand of sinners, from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of darknesse who laid vpon him whatsoever their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice could devise, from the <hi>Iewes</hi> who stumbled at him and despised him, from the <hi>Gentiles</hi> who made a game and laughing-stocke of him, from <hi>Magistrates</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented and condemned him, from the <hi>people</hi> who arrested and accused him, from the <hi>Clergie</hi> who charged him with cozinage and blasphemy, from the <hi>Laity</hi> who cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out crucifie him crucifie him, from his <hi>enimies</hi> who cruelly persecuted him, from his <hi>friends</hi> who in his greatest need started aside from him, from <hi>forrainers</hi> who disdainfully shooke the head at him, from those of his <hi>owne houshold</hi> who most treacherously betraied him, and in a word from <hi>all sorts</hi> both of <hi>men</hi> and <hi>women</hi>: yea from the <hi>Heaven</hi> which denied to giue him light, from the <hi>aire</hi> which refused to vouchsafe him breath, from the <hi>earth</hi> which would not so much as beare him, &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what not? And as from all, so hee suffered also in all. In his goods, being stript even of his raiment, and lots cast thereon, in his good name being esteemed a deceiuer, a blasphemer, a drunkard, a glutton, a magitian, a traitor to <hi>Caesar,</hi> in his friends who were scattered as soone as the shepheard was smitten, in his mother through whose heart a sword was driuen, in his <hi>soule</hi> by strong feare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his passion, and extreame sorrow in his passion, in all the parts of his body, his head being crowned with thornes, his face spit vpon, his cheekes buffited, his hands &amp; feet nailed, his sides peirced, his backe &amp; armes, scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and the whole vpon the crosse barbarously stretched
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:23186:95"/>
and racked: in all his sences, the <hi>touch</hi> by wounds, the <hi>tast</hi> with myrre and vineger, the <hi>smell</hi> with the loathsome savour of <hi>Golgotha,</hi> the <hi>hearing</hi> with shamefull taunts and revilings, and the <hi>sight</hi> with mowes and disdainefull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, finally in the whole person by death, &amp; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the soule from the body.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Intension</hi> of all which was likewise exceeding ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement, even proportionable vnto the desert of sinne, wherefore he sticketh not to say,<note place="margin">Lam. 1.12.</note> 
                     <hi>Behold and see if there be any sorrow like vnto my sorrow?</hi> And againe, <hi>the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of hell compassed me round about.</hi> Not that he felt the flames of hell fire, or the same kind of torment which the damned suffer in hell (farre bee such impiety from our thoughts) but that which is equivalent therevnto. Had he suffered only the death of the crosse, and no more, his martyrs might seeme to haue endured more bitter paines, and with more patience then he. But this in no case may be imagined His <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, his feare and conster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, his strong cries, his agonie and bloudy sweat, his earnest prayer that if it were possible the cuppe might passe from him, and that lamentable expostulation, <hi>my God my God why hast thou forsaken me,</hi> doe all mainely ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue that his pangs were high strained and extraordinary. For although he were not forsaken of his <hi>Father</hi> either by breach of <hi>personall vnion,</hi> or losse of <hi>vnction,</hi> or diminution of grace, or despaire of protection and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: yet he was abandond and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eft destitute of all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent comfort, so that his sorrowes could not but bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all other sorrowes. And indeed how could it bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise? For not to speake of the paines of the body (which yet some affirme to be more intense then could be of other men by reason of the perfection and finenesse of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:23186:95"/>
his complection) his sorrowes were not for the sinnes of one man, but of the whole world, which could be no lesse then a world of sorrow. And if his loue to vs were so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite that he was content to suffer all these extremities for vs: his sorrow for the miseries wee were in could be no lesse, but must every way bee answerable vnto his <hi>loue.</hi> So must it vnto his wisdome also: for by it perfectly knowing and apprehending all the causes and reasons of sorrow, it cannot be avoided but that according to this knowledge &amp; apprehension his sorrowes should be strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and intended.</p>
                  <p>The last point is the <hi>Duration</hi> of his paines, or how long he suffered them. They were not eternell, nor might continue vpon him for ever. Had they so continued, hee had never conquered death nor hell: and hauing not freed himselfe from them, how could hee set vs free? They continued therefore vpon him but that houre, the time destined by his <hi>Father</hi> therevnto: which being once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired; all his paines and sorrowes ceased together there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Here it will surely be obiected, the punishment due vnto sinne is an eternall punishment. If then the sufferings of <hi>Christ</hi> were only temporarie and not eternall, how hath he suffered and satisfied sufficiently for sinne? For time holdeth no proportion with eternity. Wherevnto I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer first, that in regard of the dignity of his person, the shortest punishment inflicted vpon him is equivalent to the eternall punishment laid vpon others. For hee is not a meere man, but God and man. And as there is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene time and eternity, so neither is there betweene <hi>God</hi> and meere man any proportion at all. I answere se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that eternall punishment is due only to an eternall sinne, not to that which is interrupted and broken off by
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:23186:96"/>
grace. Sinne though the act thereof bee transient, yet it leaueth such a staine vpon the soule, as continueth in it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore, if by mercy it be not blotted out, and evermore disposeth vnto sinne. Now he that is so disposed sinneth <hi>in suo aeterno,</hi> and hauing as much as lies in him a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall purpose of sinning, he shall as he deserues perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and everlastingly bee punished. But they for whom <hi>Christ</hi> died, haue their sinnes broken off by grace, their soules by little and little cleansed from the staines of sin in his bloud, a hatred and detestation of sinne wrought in them, together with a sincere loue and study of holinesse, vntill sinne be vtterly destroyed and abolished in them. <hi>Christ</hi> therefore thus purposing to put a full end to all their sinnes, reason would that an end <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> should bee set vnto his sufferings, and their sinnes not being eternall, that neither his sufferings should bee eternall. And thus much for the <hi>Duration</hi> of his <hi>Passion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The vse of all may be this. First, seeing <hi>Christ</hi> hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered all these things and that for vs, it is fit that we by all waies and meanes should study to come to the full know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof. It was not for Angells, and yet they <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly desired to looke into this mistery.</hi> Vs it concernes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and nothing more then it: and can wee possibly neglect the learning of it? The <hi>Apostle</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> accounted the knowledge hereof to be of all other the most excellent, <hi>and all other things in comparison of it to bee but losse and dung.</hi>

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:23186:96"/>
hath done for vs, wee may be the more incited to bee thankefull vnto him for it. Secondly, seeing it pleased the <hi>Father</hi> thus to decree that his sonne should suffer all these things for the satisfaction of his iustice, and that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he would not be appeased for sinne: we may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by learne <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, how precisely rigorous <hi>God</hi> is in the punishment of sinne, together with the vilenesse and odiousnesse thereof. The due consideration whereof would both terrifie vs from the committing of sinne, and worke in our hearts a loathing &amp; detestation of sinne. For if God will not be pacified without full satisfaction, how dare we commit it? And if nothing can cleanse the lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie thereof but only the bloud of the sonne of God, how can we but abhorre it? Thirdly, seeing he hath resolued to appease his wrath, and to rest satisfied for sinne in the sufferings of his sonne, wee may therein as in a crystall glasse clearly behold <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the great loue of <hi>God</hi> towards man. It was not for the sinning Angells and their redemption that he gaue his sonne, but for vs men and our salvation. Rather then he would loose the whole race of mankind, he would spare nothing, no not his best be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued. With whom although he were ever well pleased, yet he must needs suffer for vs, that in him he may be also well pleased with vs. Feare we not therefore nor despaire of grace. Though our sinnes be never so many and grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous: yet the sonne of God hath satisfied for them all. Tender wee this payment vnto his <hi>Father,</hi> and it cannot but be accepted. But yet lastly, seeing his sufferings were but a short time, and so not intended for eternall sinnes, but those only which were to haue an end: it may giue vs a cave at to breake off our sinnes be time, least being iustly cut off in them they proue eternall to vs, and so we haue
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:23186:97"/>
no benefit in the sufferings of <hi>Christ.</hi> For as the <hi>Apostle St</hi>

                     <hi>if obstinately and wilfully we resolue to sinne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we haue received the knowledge of the truth, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth no more sacrifice for sinnes.</hi> For this is <hi>to tread vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot the Sonne of God, to count the bloud of the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant wherewith we were sanctified an vnholy thing, and to doe despite vnto the spirit of grace.</hi> But of this second part, the <hi>worke of the houre</hi> enough.</p>
                  <p>The third and last is the <hi>Knowledge</hi> he had both of the worke and the houre. The <hi>Houre,</hi> saith he, <hi>is come.</hi> Hee knew it therefore, else how could he say it. And out of this knowledge was it that so often he foretold of both. Of his <hi>Passion.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 3.14.</note> As, saith he, <hi>Moses lifted vp the serpent in the wildernesse: even so must the sonne of man be lifted vp.</hi> And againe, more plainely vnto his disciples hee shewed, <hi>that he must goe vnto Ierusalem,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 13.1.</note> my houre is not yet come. Another time, <hi>Iesus knew that his houre was come.</hi> And if <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the <hi>Iewes</hi> foreknew the time of his comming in the flesh, and accordingly expected him: should not hee much more know the houre appointed vnto his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and accordingly prepare himselfe for it? For, as himselfe witnesseth, <hi>for that houre he came into the world.</hi> But how came he to the knowledge hereof? First, by the <hi>Scripture,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luc. 24.46<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> and the prediction of the <hi>Prophets.</hi> For, <hi>thus, saith he, it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer.</hi> But where is it written? Every where almost. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his <hi>Passion,</hi> in the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David</hi> especially, &amp; the prophecy of <hi>Esay.</hi> And touching the houre, in the blessing of <hi>Iudah</hi> by <hi>Iacob</hi> recorded in <hi>Genesis,</hi> and that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:23186:97"/>
memorable prophecy of seaventy weekes in <hi>Daniell,</hi> as is aboue already specified. All which <hi>Scriptures</hi> he himselfe could not but vnderstand, who opened the minds of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that they might vnderstand them.<note place="margin">Luc. 24.45.</note> Againe, he came to the knowledge hereof by speciall revelation, as being a <hi>Prophet,</hi> yea the greatest of all <hi>Prophets.</hi> For being in his humane nature assumpted into the <hi>Deity,</hi> and to this end assumpted that when the houre was come in it hee might suffer: it could not be that either the houre or the worke of the houre should be concealed from him. The <hi>Word</hi> vndoubtedly knew it, for he appointed it. As vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he made it knowne vnto his manhood which he had so neerely taken vnto him, for that the same so mainely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned it. If this be so, will some say, why then knowing it did he not avoide it? was it because he could not? Not so. For he was omnipotent: and hee only had power of his life to lay it downe or to take it vp, neither could any without his owne permission take it from him. If hee would hee might haue prayed to his <hi>Father,</hi> &amp; hee would haue <hi>sent him more then twelue legions of Angells</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue him.<note place="margin">Mat. 26.53.</note> And if before the houre was come hee had so often freed himselfe from the hands of his most violent enimies: why should he not in the very houre be as able to deliver himselfe? For his power was still the same and never a whit diminished. He could then, but would not avoide it. And why would he not? First, because his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> had decreed it, and he would in no case bee disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent vnto him. For he came to doe his will, and therefore professed it was vnto him meat and drinke to doe it. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard whereof he disclaimes his owne will. <hi>Not my will,</hi> saith he,<note place="margin">Heb. 5.8.</note> 
                     <hi>but thy will be done.</hi> Wherefore though hee were the <hi>Sonne,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 2.8.</note> 
                     <hi>yet he learned obedience: and became obedient
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:23186:98"/>
vnto death, even the death of the crosse.</hi> Secondly, because of the tender loue his <hi>Father</hi> inspired into him towards mankind. For it was the loue he bare them which made him so willing:<note place="margin">Rom. 5.8.</note> and out of it <hi>though wee were his enimies, yet he was content to dye for vs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3.16.</note> 
                     <hi>and to lay downe his life</hi> though it were so deare vnto him. Lastly, had he not bin willing, neither had he satisfied. His willingnesse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from such loue was the very forme of his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and made them meritorious. Without the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sacrifice is vaine and without vertue, according to that <hi>misericor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diam volo non sacrificium,</hi> I will mercy and not sacrifice, and againe, <hi>melior est obedientia quam victimae,</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is better then sacrifice, But it will bee said, that all this notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding he seemed very vnwilling to dye. For did not he very passionately entreat his <hi>Father</hi> to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from that houre?<note place="margin">Ioh. 12.27.</note> And that if it were possible the cup might passe from him?<note place="margin">Mat. 26 39.</note> For satisfaction of which doubt we are to know, that <hi>Christ</hi> though his manhood were assumed into the <hi>Deity,</hi> yet was hee not thereby freed from ought that is humane. Being man therefore, as man he was measured by time, and his apprehensions could not all be in an instant, but one after another succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siuely. Wherefore the first apprehension of his Passion was simple as of a thing evill in it selfe and afflictiue to his nature, without any further consideration: for so only <hi>Sence</hi> &amp; inferiour reason at the first presented it vnto him. And thus farre it is true he desired to decline it. Neither was it evill so to doe, it being agreeable to that law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which in creation was imposed vpon vs. But when in the second place it was by superiour reason presented vnto him invested with other circumstances, as namely that it was his <hi>Fathers</hi> will, that for this end he was sent
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:23186:98"/>
to the world, and that without it the world could not be redeemed there being no other meanes besides to effect it: forthwith apprehending it in this manner, hee yeelded most willingly therevnto, and said vnto his <hi>Father, not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> Iust as a <hi>Patient,</hi> who considering the potion offered him by the <hi>Physitian</hi> only as bitter &amp; distastfull loatheth and abhorreth it: but considering with all the operation thereof and what good it may doe him, he readiy admitteth and accepteth of it. And thus much touching the knowledge <hi>Christ</hi> had of his <hi>Passion</hi> and the houre thereof, together with his willingnesse to suffer in obedience to his <hi>Father,</hi> and out of the loue he bare vs.</p>
                  <p>Whence we may learne, first from his <hi>knowledge,</hi> that as he knew both what and when hee was to suffer in his owne person, so he knowes also both what and when to suffer in his mysticall body. This may minister matter of singular comfort vnto vs. For if it be so, what harme can at any time betide vs? Hee will not suffer so much as a haire to fall from our head but as hee pleaseth. For hee hath numbered them all, and there is not a teare we shed from our eyes but he laies it vp in his bottle. <hi>Many may be the troubles of the Righteous,</hi> but as he foresees them all, so will he support vs in them, and one day deliver vs from them all. Secondly from his <hi>willingnesse</hi> to suffer for vs, to assure our selues that his free-will offering is accepted of his <hi>Father,</hi> &amp; we may confidently r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the daies of triall may come who knowes? <hi>God</hi> grant vs to be of like minde whensoever it comes.

It is therefore to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest his glory, &amp; to make it publikely known throughout the world: as if our <hi>Sauiour</hi> had said, Father vnlesse thou glorify me, the brightnes of thy glory will exceedingly

be eclipsed &amp; obscured: but if thou glorifie me, then shall the <hi>Glory</hi> bee greatly manifested by me, and I shall make it knowne farre and neere among the sonnes of men. This being the meaning of these tearmes, let vs now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine both the <hi>Propositions</hi> of the argument aboue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, &amp; trie the truth of them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Maior</hi> is <hi>That by which I shall glorifie thee, and without which I cannot glorifie thee, thou maist not deny vnto me.</hi> An evident and vndoubted truth: else never would <hi>Christ</hi> haue said it, especially in a matter so much concerning him. For if, as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>the lip of vanity becommeth not a Prince,</hi> much lesse would it become him who is the <hi>wisdome</hi> of the <hi>Father</hi> and very truth it selfe. And if nothing can concerne him more then his owne <hi>Glorification</hi>: then certainely to speake sleightly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently in a matter of such moment would haue ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued much weaknesse. And indeed it is so apparently true that our <hi>Saviour</hi> only affirmes it without vouchsafing it any confirmation at all, as if hee knewe that his <hi>Father</hi> neither would nor could deny it. Neuerthelesse the truth thereof may yet further appeare: First by the continuall practise of all the Saints, conformable vnto this of <hi>Christ.</hi> For in all their addresses vnto God they ever vrged him with his Glory, as the strongest argument to perswade, when the Lord had threatned to <hi>smite the people of Israel with the pestilence and to disinherit them</hi> because of their murmuring and incredulitie,<note place="margin">Num. 14.12.</note>

hath he slaine them in the wildernesse.</hi> As if he should say, thou maist not doe it, because it will discredit both thy truth and power.

                     <note place="margin">Eph. 3.21.</note> If then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue mightily prevailed with God in vrging him with his <hi>Glorie</hi>: shall we thinke that the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God</hi> can be lesse prevalent with his <hi>Father</hi> pressing him with the same argument, <hi>Father glorifie me,</hi> for so I shall bee able, else not, to glorifie thee.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the manifestation of the <hi>Fathers Glory,</hi> is the architectonicall and soueraigne end of all things. This he

himselfe principally intended in all his works: this he set vp as a marke for all to ayme at.<note place="margin">Prov. 16.4.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon, made all things for himselfe, even the wicked for the day of evill.</hi> The predestination also of the Saints, and their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption to be children by <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> was, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth, <hi>to the praise of the glory of his grace:</hi>

                     <hi>yea of him and through him, and to him are all things: to whom be glory for euer, Amen.</hi> For to the praise of the glory of his <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> all things were created. To the praise of the glory of his <hi>Wisdome</hi> all things are ordered and gouerned. To the praise of the glory of his <hi>Mercy</hi> are wee ransomed in <hi>Christ</hi> from the bondage of misery. And to the praise of the glory of his <hi>Iustice</hi> are impenitent sinners reprobated and condemned. And reason it should bee thus. For as out of him all things were educed as being the fountaine and prime cause of all: so vnto him it was fit all things should be reduced as vnto the last and chiefest end of all. Right even as out of the sea all riuers flow, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow back againe vnto it. Neither indeed was it possible to be otherwise. For God being in himselfe blessed and all-sufficient, cannot rest in any thing that is extrinsecall and without himselfe. In himselfe therefore he must find it: and what other can that be then his <hi>Glorie</hi>? His <hi>Glorie</hi> therefore did he necessarily propound vnto himselfe as the soueraigne end of all his actions: and vnto it here doth our <hi>Saviour</hi> subordinate his owne Glorification. So that hence also the truth of our <hi>Maior</hi> plainely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that vnlesse the <hi>Father</hi> will be without his <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> (and without his <hi>Glory</hi> he neither will nor can be) he must needs grant to his <hi>Sonne</hi> that without which hee cannot glorifie him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly and lastly, the glory of the <hi>Father</hi> is most
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:23186:102"/>
deere and pretious to him. It is vnto him as the apple of his eye, which at no hand may be touched: yea as his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry selfe, because it is himselfe. Hence it is that hee is so iealous of his glory: neither can endure that it should be giuen to any other. And hence it is also that he threatens never to <hi>hold him guiltlesse whosoeuer taketh his name in vaine</hi>: yea that he will most severely bee revenged of all those that any way dishonour him.<note place="margin">Rom. 1.21.22.23.24.</note> 
                     <hi>Because,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul, when they knew God they glorified him not as God, nor were thankfull, &amp;c. therefore God also gaue them vp to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse, through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonour their bodies betweene themselues.</hi> This spirituall punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the greatest of all iudgements in this life: and is vsually attended with eternall shame and confusion of face in the next. And reason it is that they who sleight that which God holdeth so deare, should themselues be sleighted of him: and seeing they disdaine to glorifie him that he by iust vengeance should glorifie himselfe vpon them. So dealt he with <hi>Pharaoh, Nabuchadnetzar, Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, Herod,</hi> and other proud tyrants: and so will hee one day deale with all those that set so light of his <hi>Glory.</hi> Is then the glory of the <hi>Father</hi> so deare and pretious vnto him. Is he so iealous and charie of it that he will not haue it in any case touched or blemished? Then surely that which maketh for his <hi>Glory,</hi> and without which the <hi>Sonne</hi> cannot <hi>glorifie</hi> him, may not bee denied him. And so much for the <hi>Maior.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Minor Proposition</hi> is, <hi>But by my glorification I shall glorifie thee, and without it I shall not be able to glorifie thee.</hi> This though it be as true as the former, yet the truth thereof is not so evident as of that. For it may bee obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that our <hi>Saviour</hi> now praying for his <hi>Glorification,</hi>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:23186:103"/>
implies therein that he was not as yet <hi>glorified.</hi> For wee vse not to sue for what we are already possessed of, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giue thankes for it. Yet by and by he saith, <hi>Ego glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauite,</hi> I haue already glorified thee on earth.<note place="margin">Vers. 4.</note> As he was God he had from all eternity glorified him in heauen. As he was Man he had here on earth glorified him by his doctrine, life, obedience, miracles. And if wee as yet <hi>vnglorified</hi> doe glorifie him: how should not the Sonne much more be able to doe it? Vnto all which I thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer breifly, that glorifying is double, either <hi>Inchoate</hi> or <hi>Compleate.</hi> As touching the <hi>Inchoate,</hi> it is true that as the <hi>Father</hi> had in part already glorified him, as in particular by the raising vp of <hi>Lazarus</hi>:<note place="margin">Ioh. 11.4.</note> so had the <hi>Sonne</hi> also in part glorified the <hi>Father.</hi> But as touching that which is <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate,</hi> neither had the <hi>Father</hi> as yet so glorified the <hi>Sonne</hi> nor the <hi>Sonne</hi> the <hi>Father.</hi> Wherefore as our <hi>Saviour</hi> is to be vnderstood here to pray for his perfect <hi>Glorification:</hi> so are we to conceiue it also of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> as if hee had said more fully, vnlesse the Father perfectly glorifie the Sonne, neither can the Sonne perfectly glorifie the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For as God declared the glory of his power in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt by a mighty hand, &amp; with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny signes and wonders,</hi> yet had his mercy and truth, yea &amp; his power also beene much impeached, had hee not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded according to promise to settle them safely in the land of <hi>Canaan</hi>: so the <hi>Father</hi> although he had begun to shew his <hi>glory</hi> in the <hi>incarnation</hi> of his <hi>Sonne,</hi> and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his noble acts, yet if he did not goe on to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>summate and perfect his <hi>Sonnes glory,</hi> by supporting him in his last combate, raising him from death, taking him vp into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and setting him at his right hand with all power and authority, the <hi>glory</hi> of his <hi>goodnesse, wisdome, mercy, iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:23186:103"/>
and <hi>omnipotence,</hi> would bee exceedingly blemished. But when once the Sonne shall be so glorified, then shall he by vertue of the power giuen him, powre forth of his <hi>spirit</hi> vpon the sonnes of men, subdue the world vnto his obedience, trample all his enimies vnder his feet, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the kingdome vnto his Father. Whereby it will manifestly appeare, that hee is the eternall Father, very God, the author of life and saluation, sweet in his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, true in his promise, iust in retribution, wise in all his actions, and most powerfull also in his executions. And so much likewise of the <hi>Minor.</hi>

He will surely blesse them, and giue them good successe, sith his glory cannot be divided from them. A holy life glorifying God is a vitall prayer. Though wee heare no speech from it, yet it cryeth aloud in the eares of God; and saith, <hi>Father</hi> thou maist not deny to glorifie me, for through the whole course of my life I study nothing more then to glorifie thee.

                     <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>might</hi> or <hi>ability.</hi> Which although they may and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes doe concurre in the same person, yet many times they are divided.

These things duly considered, the reason of the <hi>Consequence</hi> will easily appeare. For if God haue given him authority (as indeed hee had) hee ought withall to giue him ability. For that without this is fectlesse and to no purpose: and it sits not with the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God to doe things in vaine. This were with <hi>Herod</hi> and the <hi>Iewes</hi> to set a crowne on his head, to put a reed in his hand, to clap a purple robe on his backe, &amp; to make a mock king of him. As therefore he hath giuen him <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>right</hi> and <hi>authority:</hi> so must hee also giue him <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>ability.</hi> But <hi>Ability</hi> hee can haue none, nor giue life to them that are giuen him (which is the end propounded vnto him) except his <hi>Father</hi> glorifie him. This appeares thus. The <hi>glorification</hi> which the <hi>Sonne</hi> desires, stands especially in his <hi>Resurrection, Ascention, Session</hi> at the right hand of his <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>Returne</hi> to iudgement. <hi>If then he rise not againe, we are yet in our sins</hi>

Death hath still power vpon vs, yea vpon <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe, and vtterly bars vs from eternall life. Againe if he ascend not neither can wee. The way vnto heauen is not opened, neither are there any mansi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there prepared for vs. And what life can there be, if we be excluded from those ioyes aboue. Thirdly, if hee sit not at his <hi>Fathers right hand,</hi> then can he not glorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interceed for vs with his <hi>Father,</hi> nor send his spirit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, nor governe vs by his <hi>spirit,</hi> nor subdue our eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies vnto vs, without which wee cannot be partakers of that life.

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>power,</hi> that is, as we haue aboue shewed, <hi>Right and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> over all flesh. This is double: for it is either <hi>Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall</hi> or <hi>Oeconomicall. Essentiall</hi> is that which he hath <hi>qua</hi>

hath he hath the same also inhering in him, namely an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, vnlimited, independent, and soveraigne <hi>power.</hi> And this, because it is of his very essence, so that hee can no more be without it then not be <hi>God,</hi> therefore doe I call it <hi>Essentiall.</hi> And yet, as I take it, this is not heere meant. For the end of the <hi>Power</hi> heere spoken of, is to <hi>giue eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life.</hi> Now to purpose an end implies <hi>Election</hi> &amp; <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation,</hi> and so an indifference before choice, so that it is arbitrary not necessary. But this <hi>Essentiall</hi> power of <hi>Christ</hi> is not arbitrarie but necessary, as proceeding not of choice, but of the necessity of his nature, and therefore cannot be here meant. The <hi>Oeconomicall Power</hi> then is that which he hath <hi>quà Emanuell,</hi> as he is <hi>God-man,</hi> and hath taken vpon him the forme of a servant. For the <hi>Man Christ Iesus is our Mediatour,</hi> &amp; therefore our <hi>King,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one office of his <hi>Mediation</hi> to be a <hi>King.</hi> And hence it is that our <hi>Saviour</hi> affirmeth <hi>that authority is giuen him to execute iudgement because he is the sonne of man,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 5.27.</note> or as some expound it, <hi>quatenus,</hi> as he is the <hi>sonne of man.</hi> In this nature also it is said that the <hi>government is vpon his shoulders,</hi>

True it is the humane nature subsisting in the <hi>Word,</hi> the very <hi>Word</hi> together with all the divine attributes are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated vnto it, so that it may be said, the man <hi>Christ is Omnipotent</hi> &amp; hath infinite pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:23186:106"/>
the humane nature being finite is no more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of infinite <hi>power</hi> then it is to be <hi>God,</hi> which is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. The <hi>Power</hi> then which the <hi>Manhood</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> hath residing in it, is <hi>finite</hi> and created: but yet such as is farre greater then of any creature besides. For to which of the creatures besides is the <hi>Subsistence</hi> of the sonne of God communicated? If to none, then can they not haue such power as hee that subsisteth in the <hi>Deity.</hi>

All which least any should pleade ignorance he hath caused publikely to be proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med both by word and writing. And to perswade the readier obedience to them, after the manner of all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, he annexeth both promises and threatnings: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of rich and plentifull reward to them that shall be obedient, threatnings of rigorous and severe punishment to all that shall be rebellious and disobedient. To descend to farther particularity would bee infinite. I forbeare therefore, and passe to the other part of his power, which is <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>to be the Iudge both of quick and dead.</hi> A sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Iudge, from whom lies no appeale. A righteous <hi>Iudge</hi> who accepteth the person or none, but pronounceth sentence precisely according to the worke. According I say to the worke. For herein standeth his power of judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: namely in dispencing rewards and punishments ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the observation of his lawes, or the transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them: which ever he doth vpon due cognizance of the cause, and conviction of the party. A power farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the reach of any other creature, and incident only to him who subsisteth in the person of the sonne, and that by vertue of such personall vnion.

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:23186:111"/>
vnto another: by the same proportion his kingly power is so proper vnto him, as it is vncommunicable to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whatsoever. And thus much of the first poynt <hi>Quid</hi> what is given.</p>
                  <p>Whence wee may obserue first, seeing the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> as he is man, be farre aboue all created <hi>Powers,</hi> yet is not infinite: it makes against all those who either swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low vp the humane nature into the divine, and so turne it into <hi>God,</hi> such as were some of the ancient Heretikes, and among them the <hi>Eutychians:</hi> or who shed and poure out all the divine attributes, and so the <hi>omnipotence</hi> and <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi> power of <hi>God</hi> into the <hi>humanity,</hi> such as are, if yet now adayes such there be, some of the rigider divines in <hi>Germanie.</hi> If there be such I say. For perhaps all the late quarrell risen betwixt them and vs grew only vpon mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prision (as some worthy divines haue obserued) not well distinguishing betweene <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Subsistence,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zanch. Field.</note> whereof that is <hi>finite</hi> this <hi>infinite.</hi> For <hi>Christs humanity</hi> though ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its <hi>essence</hi> or <hi>Naturall being</hi> it bee not every where, but determined vnto one place: yet in respect of his <hi>Subsistence</hi> or <hi>Personall being</hi> it is every where, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscribed in no place. For proper <hi>Subsistence</hi> of its owne and in it selfe it hath none: only the <hi>Subsistence</hi> of the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is communicated vnto it, which is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite &amp; vnlimited. Secondly, if this <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> though finite yet be incommunicable and cannot passe from him to any other: what presumption, what arrogance is it in him, who not being <hi>Christ,</hi> yet dares say with <hi>Christ, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta est mihi omnis potestas in coelo &amp; in terrâ,</hi> all power is given me both in heaven and in earth? Who therevpon takes vpon him to forge new <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude them vpon the <hi>Church</hi> vnder paine of damnation?
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:23186:111"/>
who also takes authority vnto him to make lawes equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly binding the conscience with Gods lawes, &amp; that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any relation vnto divine law at all? Who finally (for to reckon vp all the blasphemies of this sort would bee infinite) pretends a power to dispence with the law of <hi>God,</hi> to grant indulgences for sin, &amp; to free men from the punishment inflicted by <hi>God</hi> vpon them for sinne? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly whosoever challengeth these things to himselfe can be no lesse then <hi>Christi aemulus,</hi> even <hi>Antichrist</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: whose proud vsurpations vpon the power of <hi>Christ</hi> shall one day bee recompenced with equall shame and confusion. The rather because thirdly, whereas the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Christ is not secular but spirituall, hee claymeth both, and so assumeth to himselfe more then euer Christ did. <hi>Ecce in potestate nostrâ imperium vt demus illud cui volumus,</hi> Lo, saith <hi>Pope Adrian,</hi> the empire is in our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to bestow it where we please. And hence I suppose it is that insteed of the old style <hi>Vicarius Christi</hi> the Vicar of Christ, they now begin to stile him <hi>Vicedeum</hi> the Vicar of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that by this they may perhaps wrench in his temporall power, which by the other they could not, inasmuch as Christ neuer had it. Lastly therefore, seeing Christ contented himselfe with his <hi>spirituall</hi> power only, reiecting that which is <hi>secular,</hi> let not vs looke after out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pomp or state in his kingdome, nor iudge of the Church by such deceitfull notes. Rather let vs iudge of it by the lawes thereof, and by the rule of Faith profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed therein. As the power of Christ is Spirituall, so is his kingdome also, and therefore by spirituall markes and notes to be discerned. But to proceed.</p>
                  <p>The second point is, <hi>in quos,</hi> ouer whom or how farre his authority extendeth. It is, saith my text, <hi>Over all flesh.</hi> This word <hi>Flesh</hi> is diuersly vsed in Scripture. Among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:23186:112"/>
significations vsually it is put for <hi>Mankinde.</hi> As where it is said,<note place="margin">Gen. 6.12.</note> that <hi>God saw all flesh had corrupted his way vpon earth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Esa. 40.6.</note> that is, all men. And againe, <hi>All flesh is grasse, and all the goodlinesse thereof is as the flower in the field.</hi> And yet againe,<note place="margin">Mat. 24.22.</note> 
                     <hi>Except those daies should bee shortned, no flesh,</hi> that is, <hi>no man should be saued.</hi> And so is it to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood in this place, Christ hath power <hi>ouer all flesh,</hi> that is, ouer all mankinde. Now he that saith <hi>all</hi> excepts none. All men therefore of what age, sexe, degree, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or qualitie soeuer, are vnder the power and iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of Christ. And as touching the Saints, and those that are members of his mysticall body, it is question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse. For to them he is <hi>Caput</hi> a head to rule and governe them, a <hi>Husband</hi> to order and direct them, a <hi>Shepheard</hi> to feed and ouersee them. Hee hath bought them with his most pretious blood, he hath conquered them out of the hands of Satan and all that hated them, hee rules by the scepter of his word, and guides them by the manuducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his blessed spirit. And as he hath many waies made himselfe Lord ouer them, and testified his authority and power by his mighty operations in them: so haue they freely and voluntarily submitted and resigned themselues vnto him. <hi>Power</hi> therefore hath he over these, as over his obedient and louing subiects. But question may be made touching reprobate and wicked men whether hee haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny authority and power over them yea or no. For, as the Psalmist saith,<note place="margin">Ps. 2.2.3.</note> 
                     <hi>They band themselues and take counsell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether against the Lord, and against his anointed, saying, let vs breake their bands asunder and cast their cords from vs.</hi> And our Saviour in the parable, <hi>Nolumus hunc regnare super nos,</hi> we will not haue this man raigne ouer vs. But notwithstanding all this reluctation and resistance, yet
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:23186:112"/>
power and authority hath he ouer them still. Rebellious subiects they may be, yet subiects they are. Will they, nil they <hi>Dominabitur in medio hostium,</hi> hee shall raigne in the midst of his enimies. If they will not submit vnto the gentle scepter of his word, he hath an <hi>yron rod</hi> in his hand <hi>wherewith to breake and dash them in peeces like a potters vessell.</hi>

                     <hi>And those his enimies that would not hee should raigne ouer them, bring them hither will he say, and slay them here before me.</hi> Authority then he hath though they acknowledge it not: and ouerrule them he will, resist they neuer so much. Overrule them I say, either to their <hi>sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> by converting them, or to their <hi>confusion</hi> by deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them vp vnto their owne lusts. In a word, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be good or evill, how high or low soeuer they be,<note place="margin">Rev. 19.6.</note> he is Lord of them all, <hi>Rex regum &amp; dominus domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantium,</hi> King of Kings and Lord of Lords,<note place="margin">Rom. 14 9.</note> yea <hi>Dominus tum mortuorum tum vivorum,</hi> Lord both of quicke and dead. But what? Hath he power only of men, and not of other things? Yes questionlesse. For, saith <hi>David, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia subiecisti pedibus eius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 8.6.</note> thou hast put all things vnder his feet. And the <hi>Apostle</hi> applying it vnto Christ addeth, <hi>In that he put all in subiection vnder him,</hi>

I answere, that these words are not to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood <hi>exclusiuely,</hi> as if his power reached no further then vnto man, but <hi>principally</hi> and especially, and that for two causes. First because he tooke flesh and therein suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered not for Angels or any other creature, but only for vs men, according to that in the Nicene Creed, <hi>who for vs men and our saluation came downe from heauen and was incarnate.</hi>

him the nature of Angels, but tooke on him the seed of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> Secondly, for that as all things in the first creation were made for man, so in the recreation and restoring of man it was fit that power should be giuen ouer all things for man.

                  </p>

That which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth at our hands is, according as S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, first to confesse with our tongues that <hi>Iesus Christ is the Lord to the glory of God the Father,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 2.10.11.</note> aduancing him aboue all powers, thrones, and dominations whatsoeuer: and neuer to be afraid or ashamed to professe our selues to bee his Christian seruants, notwithstanding any danger might accrew vnto vs thereby. And secondly <hi>to bow the knee at the name of Iesus,</hi> that is in heart to honour, to adore, to worship him, to loue and feare him, to put all our trust &amp; confidence vpon him, and in one word to obey him.

                  <p>But when receaued he this power from him, and how long was he to hold it? He receaued it then when hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued his vnction. His <hi>Vnction</hi> he receaued in the instant of his Incarnation. For assoone as the <hi>Personall vnion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, so soone was he annointed with the oyle of gladnesse aboue all his fellowes, that is with the fulnesse of all such graces as were fit for the menaging of so great power,<note place="margin">Esa. 11.6.2.</note> as wisdome, counsell, zeale of iustice, strength, and the like. And no sooner was he annointed but presently hee was a <hi>King: Melchizedeck</hi> a king of righteousnesse, wise to doe iudgement &amp; iustice. It is true he suppressed this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for a time. For the <hi>Word</hi> emptied himselfe of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and his humane nature was to suffer many things. Wherevpon it is said,<note place="margin">Mar. 6.5.</note> 
                     <hi>He could doe no miracle in his owne country,</hi> nor might not send his Disciples into the way of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> It was as a sword in the sheath, or as <hi>Dauids</hi> authority before <hi>Sauls</hi> death.

He shall not need to fight any more with the prince of darknesse, nor to governe his <hi>Church</hi> as formerly by the word and sacrament. For <hi>God</hi> as he is now something in vs, so then shall he be all in all vnto vs. But this hee shall hold for ever, as being by the acts of his mediation iustly
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:23186:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>
acquired, and according to covenant bestowed vpon him by his <hi>Father.</hi> As therefore the <hi>Father</hi> even now raignes although he haue delivered the kingdome to the Sonne: even so then shall the <hi>Sonne</hi> also raigne, although he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver vp his kingdome vnto the <hi>Father.</hi> And thus hath Christ <hi>omnem potestatem, in omnia, &amp; in omnia secula,</hi> all power, over all things, and vnto all eternity.</p>
                  <p>The vse of this point briefly may be this. First, seeing <hi>Christ</hi> vsurped not this power: but receiued it by lawfull donation from his <hi>Father,</hi> therefore neither should wee presume vpon any office or place vntill wee be lawfully called therevnto. Should we runne without sending, wee should but incurre the displeasure of God, &amp; be authors of much confusion and mischiefe in the Church. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, seeing he receiued this power together with his <hi>Vnction,</hi> it may lesson vs not to affect any calling till wee be annointed with sufficient gifts for the discharge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. <hi>Go teach &amp; baptize all nations,</hi> saith our <hi>Saviour</hi> to his Apostles: but withall he furnisheth them with <hi>cloven tongues, and filleth them with the Holy Ghost.</hi> To adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on a businesse without due abilities, as it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from abundance of boldnesse, so will it be recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with equall measure of shame. Lastly, seeing his power continueth for ever, <hi>and of his kingdome shall be no end,</hi> wee may take knowledge that it will bee in vaine for any to oppose themselues vnto it. <hi>Hell gates shall never be able to prevaile against it</hi>: how much lesse the policies of mortall men, or their strongest attempts? For that which is eternall is invincible, and can never be destroyed. And thus much of the third point <hi>A quo</hi> from whom.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and last is <hi>Quorsum,</hi> to what so great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was given him. For wee may not thinke that <hi>God</hi> doth
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:23186:116"/>
vse <hi>magno conatu nihil agere</hi> with much a doe to effect nothing. And if nature which is but the creature of God doe nothing in vaine, and wise men ever propound some end vnto their actions: much more ought we to iudge so of him who is both the author of nature and wisdome it selfe. An end therefore was intended: and that doubtlesse of highest consequence. For otherwise what need so great power and glory to atchieue it? If in the creation <hi>dixit &amp; factum est,</hi> the word was no sooner said but the thing was done, yet here not words, no nor so great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er without his glorification will not serue the turne, this it seemes is of a higher straine then that. What then may it be? This, <hi>that to as many as are given him of his Father he may giue eternall life.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Esa 8.14.</note> This I say <hi>properly and directly: for accidentally</hi> he may be vnto some <hi>a rocke of offence,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 9 33.</note> 
                     <hi>and the savour of death vnto death,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.16.</note> namely to all those that shall presume to rise vp against that authority and power which his Father hath giuen him. For the further vnfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this point foure things are here to bee observed, <hi>Quid, Vnde, Quibus, &amp; Quamdiu. Quid,</hi> what the gift is? it is <hi>Life. Vnde</hi> whence it is, from the <hi>Sonne, that hee may giue. Quibus</hi> to whom it is giuen, <hi>to as many as thou hast giuen him. Quamdiu</hi> how long the gift lasteth, it is <hi>eternall life.</hi> And of these in order, though not according to their worth and desert (for who is sufficient for these things?) yet as it shall please God to enable and assist.</p>
                  <p>First <hi>Quid,</hi> what is the gift? It is <hi>Life. Life</hi> is double, <hi>Naturall</hi> and <hi>Spirituall. Naturall</hi> is that which things liue by power of nature. But this is not heare meant. For the <hi>Father</hi> bestowes this generally on all men, whereas the <hi>life</hi> here intended is to be conferred only on those whom the <hi>Father</hi> hath given vnto the sonne. The <hi>Spirituall</hi> is
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:23186:117"/>
likewise double, <hi>Sinfull</hi> or <hi>Holy. Sinfull</hi> is that whereby men liue vnto sinne. But because they that so liue are dead vnto righteousnesse, &amp; the wages thereof is nothing but death, neither can this be here meant. For this is to be counted rather a <hi>Death</hi> then a <hi>Life,</hi> whereas the <hi>Life</hi> here-spoken of is the end wherefore so great power was giuen vnto <hi>Christ,</hi> and so cannot bee but a happy and blessed life. The <hi>Holy life</hi> is therfore here vnderstood, a life which none can liue vntill he be dead vnto sinne, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by grace aboue nature: even that life which in <hi>Scripture</hi> is called the <hi>new life,</hi> and includeth in it both the <hi>life of grace</hi> and the <hi>life of glory.</hi> Now because this <hi>Spirituall life</hi> is denominated <hi>Life</hi> from the proportion it holds with <hi>Naturall life,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 6.4.</note> especially that of man, vnlesse we first know what this is, distinct knowledge of that we cannot well haue any. This we cannot know but by the direction of <hi>Naturall Philosophy.</hi> For <hi>Naturall life</hi> is a terme properly belonging vnto it, and the rule of <hi>Logicke</hi> teacheth that looke to what art the termes doe belong, from thence are wee to fetch our demonstrations. I must craue pardon therefore if I search a little into it. Howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it I resolue to be very briefe, and to trouble you with no more then is necessary for clearing of what is intended.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Life</hi> is of some defined by <hi>motion</hi> and <hi>operation.</hi> And so seemeth <hi>Aristotle</hi> to define it where he saith, <hi>Vivere est intelligere, sentire,</hi> to liue is to vnderstand, heare, see, touch, and the like. But this definition is more popular then proper. For life is one thing; &amp; the operations of life another, and they differ as the cause and the effect. Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is best discerned by the operations thereof, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue they thought good so to describe it. For those things are said to liue which any way moue themselues.
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:23186:117"/>
Moue I say, for those things which moue not liue not. And moue themselues by an internall principle of their owne. For neither doe those things liue which are acted only by an extrinsecall and forreine principle: such as was that statue or engine of which the <hi>Poet, Duceris vt nervis alienis mobile signum,</hi> and such as are also clocks and watches and the like devices. The same <hi>Philosopher</hi> therefore elsewhere speaking more accurately of this matter,<note place="margin">De Anima l. 2. c. 4.</note> defineth life by <hi>Being</hi>: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, saith hee, <hi>to liue is to be.</hi> Which is not yet <hi>Simply</hi> to be vnderstood, as if whatsoeuer had being had also life: but <hi>respectiuely</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to things that liue, for their life is their being. And so much doth the Philosopher himselfe insinuate, saying more fully, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>life to things that liue is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> But such a <hi>Being</hi> as naturally moueth it selfe. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it is not vnfitly defined by one to bee <hi>essentia parturiens actiones,</hi> such a being as is in trauell with action. This <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall life</hi> is threefold, <hi>Vegetatiue, Sensitiue,</hi> and <hi>Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual.</hi> The <hi>Vegetatiue</hi> is in Plants, that <hi>Being</hi> whereby they grow and receaue nourishment. The <hi>Sensitiue</hi> is of Beasts, Fowles, and Fishes, that <hi>Being</hi> whereby they see, heare, touch, tast, smell, and moue from place to place. The <hi>Intellectuall</hi> is of Angels and Spirits, that <hi>Being</hi> whereby they vnderstand and will. These all of them are iointly and together in man. For with plants hee hath growth and nourishment, with beasts, fowles, and fishes sense and lation, with Angels and Spirits vnderstanding and will. Wherevpon it is that the Philosopher maketh the life of man a rule to all the rest. And therefore is to be defined. <hi>Such a Being as is able to produce all these ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi> but specially those that are <hi>Rationall,</hi> because they are most properly <hi>Humane.</hi> To come then to an
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:23186:118"/>
issue, by all that hath beene said it appeares that to the constitution of the <hi>natural life</hi> of man, and generally of all <hi>natural life</hi> three things are required, <hi>Esse, Posse, Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rari, being, ability, and operation. Being</hi> that there may bee <hi>ability,</hi> and <hi>ability</hi> that there may be <hi>operation.</hi> For no life where no <hi>operation,</hi> no <hi>operation</hi> where no <hi>ability,</hi> no <hi>ability</hi> where no <hi>being.</hi> And such is the naturall life of man.</p>
                  <p>Proportionably wherevnto, as to me it seemes, <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life</hi> may thus be defined, <hi>Such a new or spirituall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as enableth to produce spirituall or supernaturall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> In which definition all those three things necessarily required vnto life are, as you see, comprehended. And first <hi>Being,</hi> not <hi>naturall</hi> but <hi>spirituall</hi> superadded vnto na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Superadded then when we are first ingrafted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated into <hi>Christ.</hi> For no sooner doe we subsist in him, but forthwith <hi>old things passe away and all things are made new.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.28.</note> Secondly, <hi>abilitie.</hi> For together with our <hi>new being</hi> we receaue also the <hi>Spirit of power:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Cor. 3.18.</note> whereby as while we were out of Christ wee were <hi>able to doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi>

Lastly <hi>Operation,</hi> without which <hi>abilitie</hi> is but vaine. For to what end is <hi>power</hi> if it be never brought forth into <hi>act</hi>? Operate therefore it doth and bringeth
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:23186:118"/>

                     <hi>Pietie, Sobrietie, Righteousnesse.</hi> Yea to two, <hi>Righteousnesse and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> And if we will proportion them vnto the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>naturall life,</hi> then first answerable vnto the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall life</hi> there is in the <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> a spiritual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension and knowledge of the things of God, at least so farre forth as is necessary: and in the <hi>Will</hi>; a holy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of that which is good and eschewing of that which is evill. Secondly vnto the <hi>Sensitiue,</hi> a wise direction of all the affections vpon the right obiect, and a due moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, together with a sanctified vse of the senses, as seeing, hearing, tasting, and the rest, and a right employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the members of the body, no more to be the instruments of iniquitie vnto sinne, but the weapons of righteousnesse vnto God. Lastly, vnto the <hi>Vegetatiue,</hi> an earnest desire of nourishment by the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and a continuall growing from grace to grace vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till we come to our full <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>For the <hi>donation</hi> of this life, power over all flesh &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect glorification were, as my text insinuateth, necessary
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:23186:119"/>
vnto Christ. It is therefore of great consequence, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports vs farre more then our <hi>naturall life.</hi> For that is but our <hi>Being,</hi> this is our <hi>Wel being</hi>: that is nothing but <hi>life,</hi> this is a <hi>happy</hi> aud blessed <hi>life.</hi> Some sonne of <hi>Belial</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps will deny this, esteeming it a sullen, sad, and misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life. What pleasures, say they, what delight therein? And as for sorrowes, besides those the <hi>spirituall</hi> man as man is subiect vnto, as he is <hi>spirituall</hi> hee hath his proper and peculiar crosses. For he is in continuall combate not with <hi>flesh and bloud,</hi>

                     <hi>but with Principalities and powers and the rulers of the darknesse of this world and spirituall wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesses in heauenly places.</hi> A traiterous <hi>Doeg</hi> also hee carries about within him, ever plotting how to betray him.<note place="margin">Gen: 25.22.</note> As the two twins in <hi>Rebeccas</hi> wombe, so in him the <hi>flesh</hi> and the <hi>spirit</hi> are continually warring one against another,<note place="margin">Gal: 5.17.</note> that oftentimes as she <hi>Why am I thus,</hi> so he with much anguish cries out,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.24.</note> 
                     <hi>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliuer me from the body of this death!</hi> In a word, the feares and horrors, and inward perplexities of conscience which times he feeles, are intolerable: and outwardly he is scorned, despised, persecuted, and troden vnder foot of all.

But all this notwithstanding I affirme that this <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life</hi> is of all other the most comfortable &amp; blessed. For true blessednesse standeth in two things, a freedome from the true evill, and a possession of the true good. The true evill is sinne, because it is opposite vnto the nature &amp; will of God who is the cheefest good: and therefore is iustly attended with another evill, which is Gods wrath and eternall damnation. Now the naturall ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that liueth
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:23186:119"/>
not this <hi>spirituall</hi> life lieth still in sinne, and is liable vnto the wofull consequences thereof: and therefore in the mids of all their pleasures must needs be most miserable. But the <hi>spirituall man</hi> no sooner receaues his new being. and with it his new life, but he receaues also pardon of all sinnes past, <hi>&amp; peccata semel dimissa nunquam redeunt,</hi> sins once pardoned never returne againe to iudgement. It is true if afterward he sinne againe (as who sinneth not) hee incurreth the wrath of God and deserueth condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Yet vpon a new act of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>repentance</hi> (wherein God out of his meere grace never fayleth him) he recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth actuall pardon for them also.

vpon and vndergoe any thing, rather then to forgoe the good we are possessed of. Thirdly tranquillity and peace of minde even in life and death. For knowing that <hi>being iustified from our sinnes by Faith wee haue peace with God through Iesus Christ our Lord</hi>:<note place="margin">Rom. 5.1,</note> how can wee bee without that <hi>peace of God which passeth all vnderstanding?</hi> Lastly, <hi>hope that maketh not ashamed.</hi> For out of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the present favours of God, we gather assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that we shall not fayle of those eternall ioyes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised vs in heauen. The expectation whereof sweetens vnto vs even the bitterest sorrowes of this present life, &amp; replenisheth our soules with vnspeakable comforts. So that howsoeuer carnall and worldly men deeme of it. the <hi>spirituall life</hi> is the most cheerefull and blessed life, and a very heaven vpon earth.</p>
                  <p>Out of this definition of <hi>spirituall life</hi> wee may learne, first, that as by the operations of naturall life wee easily discerne who liues it: so may wee as easily by spirituall actions iudge who liues the spirituall life. By their fruits, saith our Saviour, yee shall know them. Doth any man heare, see, talke, walke, argue, and the like; hee liues. Lies he senslesse without breath or motion? he is dead. In like manner he whose workes are only carnall and sinfull, or at the best but ciuill and morall, is though aliue vnto sin, yet spiritually dead. Were he spiritually aliue hee would proceed further to the acting of holy and spirituall ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. Which wheresoeuer they be truly and sincerely acted, there vndoubtedly is spirituall life. If it be in sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance only and shew, yet are wee still to iudge the best. For as in matters of <hi>Faith</hi> we are to thinke and speak ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Scripture</hi> which only is infallible: so in things concerning charity wee are to thinke and speake accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:23186:123"/>
to probabilitie. Which howsoeuer it may deceaue, yet is it not through any fault, or with danger of him who thinkes better of another then he deserueth, but only of the hypocrite who is farre other then hee seemed to be. But as touching our selues, because we are privie to the truth and sincerity of our owne hearts, we may certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude of our selues that we are spiritually aliue, &amp; that by the certainty of <hi>Faith.</hi> For all conclusions are of <hi>Faith</hi> which are deduced though but from <hi>one propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> contained in <hi>Scripture,</hi> if the other be any way known to be true. He that operateth spirituall actions is spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally aliue, is a proposition verified by <hi>Scripture.</hi> But I operate spirituall actions, is a proposition not contained in Scripture, but testified to me by my conscience. <hi>Ergo</hi> I am spiritually aliue, is the conclusion issuing from both, and of <hi>Faith</hi> because of the <hi>Major</hi> grounded on Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Secondly it sheweth how impotent and incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous the speech of those is who pretending to liue this spirituall life, yet when they taxed of their infirmities, as suppose too much distemper in passion, or impatience in wrongs, or the like, presently cry out, they can doe no otherwise, and who can endure it? But stay my brother, if thou be spirituall thou art not vnfurnisht of ability. What if I should say of a kinde of <hi>Omnipotencie</hi>? For so the <hi>Apostle, through Iesus Christ strengthning me I am able to doe all things.</hi> Why then saiest thou I cannot? To bee without spirituall power, is to be without spirituall life: and they only can doe nothing who are out of <hi>Christ.</hi> If therefore thou liue say no more I cannot. <hi>Nolle in causa est &amp; non posse praetenditur</hi>: thou pretendest inability, but the cause is thou wilt not. There is a sparke within thee: doe but quicken that vp, and vse thy best endeavour, and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:23186:124"/>
through Christ strengthning thee thou shalt bee able to master any infirmitie. Thirdly and lastly, seeing the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life is the only happy and truely comfortable life, why study we not aboue all things to liue this life? With out it, to win the whole world, and to enioy all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures thereof, will proue but poore gaine. For what is it to the losse of the soule, which vnlesse it liue spiritually must needs die eternally. And when this life is obtained, striue we by all meanes to keepe and preserue it. Much power and glory must Christ haue before he can giue it: and shall we hauing by gift receaued it, bee carelesse and negligent to retaine and hold it? <hi>Skinne for skinne,</hi> said he who knew it well,<note place="margin">Ioh. 2.4.</note> 
                     <hi>and all that a man hath will hee giue for his life.</hi> If for his naturall life, how much more pretious should his spirituall life be vnto him? This rather then they would loose, the holy <hi>Martyrs</hi> of God were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to part both with life and liuehood. Let the same preparation of mind be in vs, for it is the very life of our life. And thus much of the first point, <hi>Quid,</hi> what the gift is. It is <hi>Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second is <hi>Vnde,</hi> whence it is. It is from the sonne, and that by way of gift. For so saith my Text, <hi>that hee may giue.</hi> First therefore it is from the <hi>Sonne.</hi> Which yet must not be vnderstood exclusiuely, as if it were not from the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> also. For the holy &amp; blessed <hi>Trinitie</hi> is the author of all life both <hi>naturall</hi> and <hi>spirituall.</hi> This appeareth plainely. For <hi>to giue life</hi> is an extrinsecall action: and according to the old rule, <hi>actio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ad extra sunt indivisae,</hi> such actions as stay not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in but issue forth from the Deity are common to all three persons. Hence touching <hi>Naturall life</hi> it is said, <hi>In him,</hi> that is in God,<note place="margin">Act. 17.28.</note> 
                     <hi>we liue and moue and haue our being.</hi> And
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:23186:124"/>
you know who it was that first breathed the breath of life into <hi>Adam</hi>: even the wholy trinity who had said, <hi>Come let vs make man.</hi> And concerning <hi>spirituall life,</hi> hence is it that it is called <hi>Vita Dei the life of God:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen 1 26.</note>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 4.18.</note> and that <hi>Moses</hi> saith of <hi>Israell, Ipse est vita tua, He, to wit God, is thy life.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dent. 30.20.</note> Howbeit wee are further to know that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God be the fountaine of all good, yet is he to vs in regard of spirituall grace vntill we be in <hi>Christ</hi> but <hi>fons obsignatus a fountaine sealed vp.</hi> In Christ hee is a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine opened, not otherwise. For he passeth no grace but by a mediator. Him therefore hath he made the <hi>Principle</hi> of all good: and to this end hath hee filled him with the <hi>fulnesse of grace,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 1.16.</note> 
                     <hi>that of his fulnesse wee might all receiue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven grace for grace.</hi> And in this sense is it that wee say <hi>Spirituall life</hi> is from him.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.10.11</note>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 3.3.</note> Whence also it is called <hi>the life of Christ:</hi> &amp; Christ himselfe is called, <hi>the Lord &amp; giver of life,</hi> yea and said to be our <hi>very life.</hi> But how this life is derived from him vnto vs let vs enquire a little farther. And because out of naturall <hi>Philosophy</hi> we haue hitherto proportioned the spirituall life for the substance thereof with the <hi>Naturall</hi>: giue me leaue a little to reflect againe vpon the same <hi>Science</hi> to proportion out the manner of conveying it also. First therefore vnto <hi>life a Soule</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary: for without it nothing can liue. Secondly, it is as necessary that the <hi>Soule</hi> haue <hi>life</hi> in it selfe: or else how can it giue <hi>life?</hi> for nothing giueth that which it selfe hath not. Thirdly, the <hi>Soule</hi> must not only haue life in it, but also a power to quicken and make aliue. For as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>the soule is the cause and principle of life to the liuing body.</hi> Fourthly, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this <hi>life</hi> and <hi>quickning power</hi> of the <hi>Soule,</hi> it is necessary for the conveyance of life vnto the body,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:23186:125"/>
that it be first <hi>infused</hi> and hypostatically vnited therevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. For before <hi>God</hi> breathed the <hi>Soule</hi> into <hi>Adam,</hi> his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy though otherwise organized and formed, lay but as a dead lumpe breathlesse and lifelesse. But no sooner was the <hi>soule</hi> powred into him, but forthwith he began to liue the <hi>life</hi> of a man. For fiftly, vpon the <hi>vnion</hi> of <hi>soule</hi> and <hi>body</hi> riseth the constitution and being of <hi>man.</hi> For neither is the <hi>soule</hi> nor the <hi>body</hi> severally and asunder called <hi>Man,</hi> but the whole ioyntly &amp; composed together, vpon which constitution and being of <hi>Man</hi> resulteth in the sixt place the naturall life of man, and continually remaineth vntill the dissolution betwixt <hi>Soule</hi> and <hi>Body.</hi> And lastly, vpon this naturall life proceede 'those humane and connaturall operations, of which aboue. Now let vs as briefly apply all this vnto our present purpose. First that which in the conveyance of this <hi>spirituall life</hi> is answerable vnto the <hi>soule</hi> is <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>Mediator</hi>: who therefore in six hundred places of <hi>Scripture</hi> is said to be <hi>our life.</hi> And himselfe saith of himselfe, <hi>I am the resurrection and the life</hi>: and againe, <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life.</hi> Secondly, as the <hi>Soule,</hi> so hath <hi>Christ</hi> also life in himselfe. <hi>As the Father,</hi> saith he, <hi>hath life in himselfe, so hath he giuen vnto the Sonne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to haue life in himselfe.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 5.26.</note>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.2.</note> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that the <hi>Spirit of life is in the Sonne.</hi> And S. <hi>Iohn, This life is in his Sonne.</hi> And againe,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 5.11.</note>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 1.4.</note> 
                     <hi>This life was in him,</hi> and <hi>the life was the light of men.</hi> Thirdly, as the <hi>soule</hi> hath not only <hi>life</hi> in it but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a quickning power,<note place="margin">Ioh. 5.21.</note> so hath <hi>Christ</hi> also. So S. <hi>Iohn, As the Father,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.45.</note> 
                     <hi>so the Sonne quickneth whomsoeuer he will.</hi> And S. <hi>Paul,</hi> The <hi>first Adam was made a living soule, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Adam was made a quickning spirit.</hi> Fourthly, as the <hi>soule</hi> vntill it be <hi>personally</hi> vnited quickneth not so neither doth <hi>Christ</hi> vntill he be <hi>mystically</hi> vnited. Of this <hi>Vnion</hi>
                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:23186:125"/>
I cannot now speake, I shall hereafter when I come to those words,<note place="margin">vers. 22.23.</note> 
                     <hi>That they may be one as we are one, I in them, and thou in me.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> In the meane season thus S. <hi>Paul I liue, yet not I, but Christ liueth in me</hi>: that is, I liue by <hi>Christ</hi> vnited vnto me.<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 5.12.</note> And S. <hi>Iohn, He that hath the Son</hi> that is, he that is vnited vnto him, <hi>hath life: but he that hath not the Sonne,</hi> that is, is not vnited vnto him, <hi>hath not life.</hi> Fiftly, as the <hi>Vnion</hi> of soule and body makes and constitutes <hi>Man,</hi> so vpon our <hi>Vnion</hi> with Christ are we made new men,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.12.</note> 
                     <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stian men,</hi> spirituall men, yea, as is aboue proued, very <hi>Christ.</hi> So speaketh S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the place alleadged: and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>yee are of God in Christ Iesus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.30.</note> that is, by being in <hi>Christ</hi> yee haue receiued of <hi>God</hi> a new essence or being. Sixtly, as from the naturall being of man comes naturall life,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14.19.</note> so from the spirituall issues spirituall life. <hi>Because I liue,</hi> saith our <hi>Saviour, yee</hi> (to wit who receiue of my <hi>spirit,</hi> and so are <hi>spirituall men, yee</hi> I say) shall liue. Seventhly and lastly, as from humane life proceed humane operations: so from the spirituall proceed spirituall actions. This hath beene already shewed, wherevnto I now only adde that of S. <hi>Paul, If Christ be in you, the body indeed is dead vnto sinne,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.10.</note> 
                     <hi>but the spirit is life vnto righteousnesse.</hi> And thus you see how and after what manner <hi>spirituall life</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed vnto vs from <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is further added that this <hi>life</hi> is not only from <hi>Christ,</hi> but that he is the donour and giuer thereof. It is from him, but by way of gift.<note place="margin">Iohn 6.33.</note> For so it is said, <hi>that he may gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e.</hi> So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so elsewhere, <hi>The bread of God is he which commeth downe from heauen,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 6.23.</note> 
                     <hi>and giueth life vnto the world.</hi> And S. <hi>Paul, the wages of sinne is death, but the gift of God is eternall life through Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.7.</note> Wherevpon S. <hi>Peter</hi> calleth it <hi>the grace of life.</hi> And the <hi>scripture</hi> every where impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:23186:126"/>
the whole worke of our <hi>salvation</hi> from the beginning vnto the end thereof vnto meere grace. Now as he saith, <hi>Gratia non est gratia nisisit omnimodo gratuita</hi>: grace is not grace vnlesse it be every way of free gift. And certainly if it be not of free gift, it is of merit and due preparation in our selues. But I beseech you what merit, what preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of himselfe was there in <hi>Adam</hi> vnto life, while as yet he lay like a dead lump of clay before his maker? What in <hi>Lazarus</hi> when he had beene <hi>quatriduanus</hi> foure dayes in the graue, and began to putrifie and corrupt? Surely none at all. No more can there be in vs, who before we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue this <hi>life,</hi> are vtterly dead in trespasses and sins. If the creature disposed not himselfe vnto his creation, nor man vnto his generation, nor the science vnto its incition: how can we prepare our selues either to our renovation, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, or ingrafting into the mysticall body of <hi>Christ?</hi> In a word, can <hi>sinne</hi> be a disposition or preparation vnto <hi>Grace</hi>? I trow no. Yet whatsoeuer we doe before we are new creatures and liue the spirituall life, is at the best but <hi>splendidum peccatum,</hi> a gay and glittering sinne. For the agent is altogether sinfull and carnall: and whatsoeuer is of flesh is flesh. Doe we <hi>gather grapes of thornes, or figgs of thistles,</hi> or good fruite of an evill tree? No verily. For such as the tree is, such fruit it yeeldeth, Good it cannot yeeld till it be made good. Made good we are not till wee beleeue. Till we beleeue therefore can wee doe no good. If so, then what is not of <hi>Faith, is sinne,</hi> and pleaseth not <hi>God.</hi> And what pleaseth not him cannot dispose vnto grace. Being then without merit and disposition vnto grace, it must needs follow, that as <hi>spirituall life</hi> is by <hi>Vnion,</hi> so it is also by way of <hi>gift</hi> from <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The vse of all may be first, to teach vs that all they who
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:23186:126"/>
are not vnto <hi>Christ</hi> mystically vnited are spiritually dead: and what actions soeuer proceed from them notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all the specious and goodly shew they make, are not living actions. For being not acted by the spirit of <hi>Christ,</hi> they are not like vnto bodies animated by a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane soule: but vnto such dead bodies rather as are raised vp by magicians, and are stirred and moved only by the spirit of <hi>Satan.</hi> These may seeme to liue, but indeed liue not. And if <hi>spirituall life</hi> bee the only blessed life, then must these needs bee in a most ruefull and miserable case. Secondly it teacheth vs, that if we desire to liue this, wee must indeavour by all meanes to be vnited vnto <hi>Christ.</hi> He is come vnto vs that we <hi>might haue life,</hi> yea and that we <hi>might haue it in abundance.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 10.10.</note> If we come not to him, it is our fault if we liue not. And iust cause shall we giue him to complaine of vs,<note place="margin">Ioh. 5.40.</note> as he did of the <hi>Iewes, yee will not come to me that yee might haue life.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 17.</note> Our comming is by <hi>Faith.</hi> By it <hi>Christ dwelleth in our harts</hi>: and by it <hi>is the iust man</hi> said <hi>to liue.</hi> This purgeth and purifieth our soules, and produceth in vs the works of charity, which are the right operations of <hi>Spirituall life.</hi> Thirdly, seeing we liue by <hi>Christ,</hi> it is reason we should also liue vnto him. For as S. <hi>Augustin</hi> saith, every thing should liue to that by which it liueth: as the body because it liveth by the <hi>Soule</hi> ought to liue vnto the <hi>Soule.</hi> Hence therefore is it that S. <hi>Paul</hi> would haue all that <hi>are dead vnto sinne to reckon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues aliue,</hi>

which liue should not henceforth liue vnto themselues, but vnto him which died for them and rose againe.</hi> You will say, how are we to liue vnto <hi>Christ</hi>? I answere, as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy liueth vnto the <hi>Soule.</hi> The Body liueth vnto the Soule when it is serviceable and obedient therevnto: especially when it followeth not the sway of inordinate passion, but the direction of right reason.

                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.1.9.</note> are in Christ, but they only who are lead by <hi>the spirit of Christ.</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> expresseth it by <hi>liuing not to the lusts of men,</hi>

Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all which he opposeth <hi>liuing according to God in the spirit.</hi> Fourthly and lastly, hence we may learne humility to ascribe nothing to our owne selues. For what are wee in nature but stinking carkasses? If we liue, it is by the meere grace of Christ. Come vnto him of our selues to be quickned by him we could not.

And thus all men whatsoeuer both elect and reprobate are giuen vnto him. But this is not here meant, as by and by shall appeare. Another donation therefore there is more speciall and singular whereby the <hi>Father</hi> deliuereth vnto the <hi>Sonne</hi> some of the creatures as vnto a <hi>head</hi> to be his members, or (to persist in our present similitude) giueth them as a <hi>body</hi> to the <hi>soule</hi> to be acted and quickned by him: that is, to be ruled and ordered not only by the <hi>Scepter</hi> of his <hi>Power,</hi> but of his <hi>Grace</hi> and sanctifying <hi>Spirit</hi>: Now who are these? Surely not all flesh: for all are not vnited to him, and so liue not by him. Who then? They that are elected and chosen vnto life: of whom it is said <hi>Multi vocati, pauci verò electi,</hi> many are called, but few are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen.

him, and excluded from being the <hi>Fathers</hi> together with them. Whence it followeth necessarily, that the <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> here meant is not of all, but those only who in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall sort are the <hi>Fathers,</hi> namely his chosen and peculiar ones. For the better vnderstanding hereof, and that you may knowe how and in what order the <hi>Father</hi> is pleased to proceed in this gracious worke, thus I take it you are to conceaue thereof. First, the <hi>Father</hi> seeing all mankind by the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> to bee corrupted and in the state of damnation, out of his meere mercy and loue decreed, not to loose the whole race of man, but to renew and repaire againe his image in some of them, <hi>to the praise of the glory of his grace:</hi> prouided yet alwaies that his iustice for sinne be fully satisfied. Secondly, for the satisfaction of his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, he further decreed to send his <hi>sonne</hi> into the world, that taking our nature vpon him, he might therein suffer whatsoeuer was due to sinne, and so mediate a peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and vs. Then thirdly, out of the corrupt Masse of mankinde he selecteth and chuseth some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, even such as he pleaseth, with a purpose infallibly to bring them to everlasting life. And in regard of this act it is that our <hi>Saviour</hi> saith <hi>tui erant</hi> they were from al eternity thine: and againe, <hi>tui sunt,</hi> by the constant conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of the same purpose they are still thine. In the fourth place those that are thus elected the <hi>Father</hi> giueth vnto the <hi>Sonne</hi> to accomplish his purpose vpon them, and by vertue of the power and life giuen him, to quicken them vnto eternall life. Being thus giuen wee are now Christs. Wherevpon also the Church is bold and saith, <hi>My welbeloued is mine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cant. 2.16.</note> 
                     <hi>and I am his</hi>: and S. <hi>Paul</hi> directly affirmeth <hi>that we are Christs.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor: 3.23.</note> And being Christs, fiftly &amp; lastly, he actually enliues &amp; quickens them, raising them
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:23186:128"/>
vp from the death of sinne, and convaying into them the spirit of life, in such sort as wee haue formerly declared.</p>
                  <p>But doth <hi>Christ</hi> bestow life vpon all them that are so given him? yea verily, my text expressely affirmeth it, <hi>that he should giue eternall life to as many as thou hast giuen him.</hi> This was the very end wherefore the <hi>Father</hi> gaue them to him. And shall we thinke that the <hi>Father</hi> tooke not order sufficient for the attaining of his end? <hi>God</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid. For because he would not faile of his end, therefore did he giue so great power vnto his <hi>Sonne.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 10.28.</note> Such power that nothing,<note place="margin">ibid. 10.10.</note> except he would, could plucke them out of his hands: and so much life, that if hee would hee might giue it in abundance. Shall we say that the <hi>Sonne</hi> though he hath power yet wants will? Farre be such blasphemy from vs.<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.38.</note> For he testifieth of himselfe <hi>that hee came downe from heauen</hi> with this resolution,<note place="margin">Id. 5.30.</note> 
                     <hi>not to doe his owne will, but the will of him that sent him</hi>:<note place="margin">Id. 4.34.</note>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 6.39.</note> and now that he is come, <hi>that he seeketh not his owne will, but the will of the Father that sent him,</hi> yea <hi>that it is meat vnto him, to doe the will of him that sent him, and to finish his worke.</hi> Now this is the <hi>Fathers will that of all which he gaue him hee should loose nothing,</hi> but as my text saith, <hi>giue vnto them eternall life.</hi> It is therefore the will of the Sonne also. And because ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the old rule <hi>Qui potest &amp; vult facit,</hi> hee that both can and will doth, vndoubtedly Christ being both able and willing giueth vnto all the elect everlasting life. Hence of his <hi>Sheepe</hi> that is of the elect he saith,<note place="margin">Ioh. 10.28.</note> 
                     <hi>I giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them eternall life, and they shall never perish.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:23186:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>
looseth some of them. For they that liue not eternally perish eternally. But the Sonne plainely affirmeth that all that are <hi>giuen him he keepeth in his Fathers name and loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <note place="margin">Heb. 2.13.</note> so that in the last day he may truly say, <hi>Loe here I am and the children which thou hast given mee.</hi> And thus to them and to all them whom the Father hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him hee giueth life. But did the <hi>Father</hi> intend it, or doth the Sonne bestow it only on them, excluding all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? To this question because my text directly answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing, I shall haue iust occasion hereafter fully to handle it where our Saviour denieth that he praies for the World:<note place="margin">vers 9.</note> I forbeare the resolution of it for the present, and reserue it till then as the fitter place. In the meane season.</p>
                  <p>This vse may we briefly make hereof, First, it may serue as a cristall mirror wherein to behold the infinite &amp; vnspeakable goodnesse &amp; loue of the <hi>Father</hi> towards vs. When we were in the same masse of corruption together with all mankinde, it pleased him by free election to single vs from the rest, and to bestow vs vpon his Son, that hee might bring vs vnto life. Vpon what merit? None at all. For wee were as deepe in the same condemnation as the rest. But such was his good will and pleasure: and this is the glory of his grace, <hi>Miserebo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> cuius misertus fuero,</hi> I will haue mercy on whom I will haue mercy. Seeing se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly by the gift of the <hi>Father</hi> wee are <hi>Christs,</hi> let vs know that he is a good depositary, of such care and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse that he will not neglect his <hi>Fathers</hi> pledge, of such strength and ability that nothing is able to wrest it out of his hands. Were wee our owne, or were wee our owne keepers, we should surely perish. But now Christ is charged with vs who is the safest keeper, and who is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:23186:129"/>
to preserue vs safe vntill the time that he is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliuer vs backe againe vnto his <hi>Father,</hi> who thenceforth shall be <hi>all in all</hi> vnto vs. Wherefore thirdly the best course we can take is wholly &amp; absolutely to resigne our selues into his hands. To trust to our selues or to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is to rely on a broken reed. But he is a sure rocke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom we may securely build. The <hi>Father</hi> is wiser then wee, and he knew well enough what he did when he commended vs to his Sonne. And the <hi>Sonne</hi> loueth vs farre better then we can loue our selues. When wee were his enemies he was content to dye for vs: now wee are his friends doth he abate of his loue towards vs? Not a whit. Let vs therefore with all confidence entrest our selues both soules and bodies vnto him to dispose of vs at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. So shall wee rest safe from all dangers, and in the end be prouided of everlasting salvation. In the meane sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son let vs in the last place, loue, yea and long for his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond comming, that being his, <hi>there where hee is wee may be also.</hi> For here though wee be safe, yet are we not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out assaults: &amp; those assaults many times shake our <hi>Faith,</hi> and fill vs full of doubts and fears. This indeed is our weaknesse: For otherwise in regard of the <hi>Fathers</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and the Sonnes protection wee are safe: But when he shall returne againe to take vs home to himselfe, then shall all doubts and feares cleane be banished. For we shall no more beleeue, but see our selues free from all dangers, and in perfect safety. Wherfore <hi>come Lord Iesus come quickly.</hi> And of the third point <hi>Quibus,</hi> to whom thus much.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and last in <hi>Quamdiu,</hi> how long this life continues. It continues not for a time only as doth the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall life, which after a short while suffereth interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:23186:130"/>
and is broken off by death: but it is an <hi>eternall life,</hi> as my text saith, and continueth for ever more, vnto the proofe whereof before I descend, I must craue leaue to remoue certaine rubs out of our way, which otherwise may let and hinder vs in our course. For <hi>Spirituall life</hi> in regard of the degrees thereof being double, <hi>of grace</hi> and <hi>of glory</hi>: there are who restraine eternity vnto this only excluding that: as if the life of <hi>grace</hi> sometime attained not the degree of <hi>glory,</hi> but the life of <hi>glory</hi> once attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned continued eternally. Howbeit that the life of <hi>Grace</hi> is also here meant plainely appeareth by the words imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly following,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.47.</note> where our saviour saith <hi>This is life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting to know thee, &amp;c.</hi> For to know <hi>God in Christ</hi> is an operation of <hi>Spirituall life.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 5.12.13.</note> So also elsewhere, <hi>He that beleeueth hath eternall life.</hi> And againe, <hi>Hee that hath the sonne hath life,</hi> life I say <hi>eternall</hi>: for so it is forthwith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, <hi>that yee may know that yee haue eternall life.</hi> Where you see that the words are not of the future tense <hi>shall haue,</hi> but of the present <hi>hath life:</hi> which what other can it be but the <hi>life</hi> of <hi>Grace?</hi> And of this it is affirmed that it is <hi>eternall,</hi> and so cannot faile of glory. But further when it is said to be eternall, we are to know that there is a double eternity, the one <hi>Simple</hi> and absolute, the other only <hi>Respectiue. Simple eternity</hi> is that which is so both a <hi>parte ante &amp; a parte post</hi> hauing neither beginning nor ending. And so is <hi>God</hi> only eternall. The <hi>Respectiue</hi> is that which is so only <hi>a parte post,</hi> hauing indeed a beginning, but afterward never ending. And so <hi>Angells</hi> &amp; the <hi>Soules</hi> of men are said to be eternall: and in the same sense doe we vnderstand it of <hi>Spirituall life,</hi> that in regard of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it is eternall. Yet here againe we are to distinguish. To the constitution of life three things, as wee haue said,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:23186:130"/>
are required, <hi>Being, Power,</hi> and <hi>Operation.</hi> As touching the <hi>Operations</hi> of life, we confesse they may suffer inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission. For as in an <hi>Epilepsie,</hi> or fit of the falling sicknes no worke of life appeares, and yet the partie liues: so in the acting of sinne, from which the best men are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies free, <hi>spirituall operations</hi> during the while cease, and yet life continues. As touching <hi>Power,</hi> that is <hi>Gracious ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits</hi> imprinted vpon the <hi>soule</hi> and enabling to operate, I distinguish againe. For some of them either in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues or vs argue defect and imperfection, and pertaine only to the condition of this present life, such as are, <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> and the like. Others import perfection &amp; pertaine also to the next life, among which excells <hi>Charity.</hi> The former in the end of this life cease. For we beleeue because we see not, and hope because we possesse not, and repent because we sinne. But when wee see, possesse, and are free from sinne, then <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> vanish away. As for the latter they never cease, but continue with vs evermore. Yet here againe are we once more to distinguish. For these habits may be considered, either in regard of <hi>Substance</hi> or <hi>Degree.</hi> In regard of degree we confesse they may suffer abatement. For <hi>Faith</hi> may fall from its <hi>Plerophorie</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> fulnesse to an <hi>Oligopistie</hi> or lower degree thereof: and <hi>Charity</hi> also may remit much of its fervor. So that in this respect a man may be said to bee <hi>moribundus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 3.2.</note> declining as it were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death. But in regard of <hi>Substance</hi> or <hi>Being</hi> we confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently affirme in such sort as is aboue said that they never perish, and the <hi>spirituall man</hi> neuer dieth. To winde vp all in a word, <hi>actus intermitti potest, &amp; gradus remitti, sed ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitus ipse nunquam potest amitti,</hi> the act may suffer inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission for a time, &amp; the degree abatement or remission,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:23186:131"/>
but the habit or life it selfe never loosing or amission. The question being thus clearely stated, let vs now proceed to proofe.</p>
                  <p>That the life of <hi>Grace</hi> in all them that are giuen vnto Christ by the <hi>Father</hi> is <hi>eternall,</hi> might be proued by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny arguments. All what I haue to say shall be reduced to one. <hi>If the life of grace at any time fayle, and the elect of God spiritually dye, either it is through the deficiencie of the Procreant and Conservant causes of life or the efficiencie &amp; power of the contrary corrupting causes. But it is neither through the one or the other. Ergo neither doth the life of Grace at any time fayle, nor the elect of God die.</hi> The <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor proposition</hi> needs no proofe. For a third cause cannot be named, and therefore of necessitie it must bee one of the two if there be any. The <hi>Minor</hi> therefore I am by all meanes to fortifie, and to maintaine that neither the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creant</hi> and <hi>Conservant</hi> causes fayle, nor the contrary cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting causes prevaile. The efficient and preseruing cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of <hi>spirituall life</hi> is as wee haue shewed, the holy and blessed Trinitie, the <hi>Father</hi> through his <hi>Sonne</hi> by the powerfull operation and working of the holy Ghost. These if they fayle, either it is because they cannot or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they will not continue this life. To say they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not is no lesse then blasphemie, and contrary both to Scripture and reason. For <hi>Omnipotence</hi> is an essentiall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of the <hi>Deitie,</hi> so that he can no more cease to bee almightie, then cease to be himselfe and loose his being. In the <hi>Creed</hi> is this title ascribed vnto the <hi>Father:</hi> how-be it not exclusiuely.<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.3.</note>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 1.2.3.</note> For the Sonne and the holy Ghost being coessentiall with him,<note place="margin">Iob: 33.4.</note> they are coequall also in might and power.<note place="margin">Ps. 33.6.</note> The <hi>sonne by the word of his power cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated all things together with his Father,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 15.9.13.19.</note> and <hi>by the same
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:23186:131"/>
word vpholdeth all things.</hi> And to the holy Ghost power also is attributed, even the same power whereby things were created, and wonders aboue the reach of nature are wrought. If it bee said that the Sonne by taking our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vpon him made himselfe inferiour to his Father, I confesse it: and withall that his mediatorie power is lesse then his Fathers. Neverthelesse all power is giuen him both in heauen and earth, such a power as no creature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides is capable of, and which was giuen to this very ende that he might both giue life &amp; continue it vnto eternity. Vnto which had it not beene sufficient without question greater had beene giuen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the Father may not fayle of his end. Of the power of God therefore there can bee no doubt,<note place="margin">Esa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 63.1.</note> but that he is <hi>mighty to saue, able to make vs stand, able to keepe vs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 14.4.</note> so that none vnlesse he will can <hi>take vs out of his hands.</hi>

                     <hi>and our life is hid with God in Christ.</hi> But enquire we a little deeper into this mystery. And first the will of the Father appeareth many waies.

                     <hi>I haue loued thee,</hi> saith he, <hi>with an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall loue,</hi> a loue which as it is without beginning, so shall

it likewise be without ending. Nay if the loue of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is more to her child when she beareth it in her armes then while it was in her womb: we may not think but the loue of the <hi>Father</hi> continueth at least as great towards vs when we are new borne of him, as it was when we were yet but conceaued, as it were, by election. Thirdly by donation of Christ to the elect. For what greater testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie either of his loue, or of his will to saue then this? <hi>So God loued the world,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>that hee gaue his onely begotten sonne,</hi>

His willingnesse also appeares many waies. First by his profession of conformitie and obedience to his Fathers will, whereof wee haue already spoken sufficiently.

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>by giuing himselfe for vs.</hi> For if then hee was content with the expence of his dearest blood to ransome vs whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we were his enimies: how much more now is it his will

&amp; pleasure to saue vs,<note place="margin">Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5.9:</note> hauing of enimies made vs friends, and begun the <hi>spirituall</hi> life in vs? Thirdly, <hi>by conioyning vs vnto himselfe</hi> in so straight a bond of vnion that we are of his bone and of his flesh. For it may not bee imagined that he hateth his owne flesh, but loueth all the members of his body so dearely, thas as long as hee is able hee will surely preserue them aliue. Fourthly, <hi>by his mediatory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession.</hi> For as he prayed for <hi>Peter</hi> that his faith might not faile, so he intended the same vnto all beleeuers, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the sequele of this prayer where he saith, <hi>I pray for them also which shall beleeue in me through their word,</hi> and requests his Father also to keepe them. Which hee would never haue done but that he earnestly desired their preservation in life. Fiftly, by his <hi>care and desire that wee should every way be conformed to him:</hi> that as he died and rose againe and from thenceforth dieth no more, so wee should first dye to sinne, and then liue to righteousnesse, and afterward spiritually never dye more. Lastly, by sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto vs the holy Ghost, to lead vs into all truth, to comfort vs, and to consecrate vs vnto him both Soules and Bodies.</p>

aboue nature? Herevnto, to expresse my selfe more fully, I answere foure things. First, if wee were such as we ought to be, we might of our selues by the meanes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vnto vs come vnto <hi>Christ.</hi> That now wee cannot is through our owne default who haue disabled our selues. And yet the obligation still lieth vpon vs, and wee are bound to bring with vs power, abilility, and fit dispositions. If wee neither doe nor can, yet may <hi>God</hi> iustly exact them of vs, as the Creditor may his debt of the vnthrift that cannot pay him: neither is he bound againe to enable him by grace, no more then a <hi>Creditor</hi> is to supply the wants of his wastfull and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall <hi>debter.</hi> Secondly, although in things supernaturall and spirituall the act of <hi>Willing</hi> be not in our power: yet are there many prerequisites going before which are in our power, as to goe to Church, to heare Gods word preached, to meditate vpon it, to seeke further informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. without which ordinarily God saueth none. God blesseth not our idlenesse, but our labour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he that will not labour shall not eate, he shall eat that seeketh his <hi>bread</hi> in the sweat of his browes. He that will not plow nor sow, shall not reap the crop: and he that will not striue and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour himselfe shall not obtaine grace. Thirdly, if a man hauing the meanes of grace offered him, shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto adde his owne endeavour, and doe whatsoeuer lieth in his owne power: who knoweth but that God will bee gracious to that man? Or rather to declare my mind free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I doubt not but that God will be gracious vnto him. And although others wrench and stretch the place too farre for their owne advantage, yet will I not bee afraid with as graue <hi>Divines</hi> as this land affordeth any to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it vnto this purpose,<note place="margin">Mat. 25.28 29.</note> 
                     <hi>Habenti dabitur,</hi> to him that hath

shall be giuen. God forsaketh not man vntill man forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him: neither fayles any vntill hee bee defectiue vnto himselfe. Then indeed the talent which he would not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy shal be taken from him: but he that imploies it care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully shall receaue more, yea <hi>shall haue abundance.</hi> Being thus called and affected God will never cease to further our conversion, vnlesse wee our selues stop his course ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by carelesse neglect or wilfull rejection of grace. Lastly, when we haue done whatsoeuer we can doe, yet is <hi>conversion</hi> out of our power, it is the work of <hi>Gods free grace,</hi> which grace of vnwilling maketh vs willing, not by forcing and constraining the will, but <hi>sweetly inclining</hi> and bending it.<note place="margin">Cant. 1.4.</note> For albeit God in converting vs bee said to <hi>draw</hi> vs,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.44.</note> yet may we not conceaue this <hi>Drawing</hi> to be constraint or violent coaction. Hee <hi>drawes</hi> vs indeed: what? as <hi>stocks</hi> and stones? No, but as <hi>men: I will draw them,</hi> saith God, <hi>with the cords of a man, with the bands of loue.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ose. 11.4.</note> 
                     <hi>Grace</hi> so prevaileth vpon the will, as it preserueth the libertie thereof. It cannot will before Grace, grace maketh it willing. When we are first converted by grace, we convert willingly: and whensoeuer we will, wee will freely. For will is not will vnlesse it be free. <hi>Grace</hi> indeed setteth free the will: yet except wee will our conversion freely we can neither be converted nor saued, according that of <hi>Bernard, Nisi sit liberum arbitrium non est quod saluetur, nisi sit gratia non est vnde saluetur,</hi> vnlesse there be free will there is nothing to be saued, vnlesse there be <hi>grace,</hi> there is no meanes whereby to bee saued. And thus much haue I thought good to speake touching the forme of words, or the <hi>liberty</hi> of them that are counselled, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to cleare God from being the cause why wee follow not this counsell, and partly to set an edge vpon our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to follow it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:23186:139"/>The <hi>Counsell</hi> it selfe is threefold, first, <hi>abnegation of our selues,</hi> secondly, <hi>bearing of the crosse,</hi> thirdly, <hi>following of Christ.</hi> And of every of them there is a conditionall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, <hi>if we will come after Christ.</hi> For howsoeuer sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply we may chuse whether we will <hi>deny our selues</hi> or not <hi>deny our selues, take vp the crosse,</hi> or not <hi>take vp the crosse, follow Christ,</hi> or not <hi>follow him</hi>: yet <hi>conditionally if wee will come after Christ</hi> we must of necessity <hi>deny our selues, take vp our crosse daily, and follow him.</hi> So that in euery of these Counsels we are to consider, first the <hi>Substance,</hi> and then the <hi>Necessity</hi> of it. But before we come particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly vnto them, we must needs premise a word or two touching the condition, and enquire what it is <hi>to come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Christ.</hi> Among divers interpretations, two there are which to me seeme most likely. The first is, <hi>if any will come after me,</hi> that is, <hi>if any will be my Disciple.</hi> Thus S. <hi>Luke</hi> himselfe seemeth to expound it, where speaking in a manner to the same purpose he saith,<note place="margin">Luc. 14.27.</note> 
                     <hi>whosoeuer beareth not his crosse and followeth mee, cannot bee my Disciple.</hi> Wherevnto reason also agreeth, for <hi>Schollers</hi> vse not to goe before their <hi>Masters,</hi> but to come after them: whence vsually they are called <hi>Followers,</hi> as the <hi>Followers</hi> of <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> the <hi>Followers</hi> of <hi>Aristotle.</hi> In this sence then it is as if our Saviour should say, <hi>If any will be my scholler.</hi> But hee meanes a <hi>scholler</hi> not <hi>titularlie</hi> and in name only, like <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries</hi> boxes <hi>quorum tituli habent remedia, pyxides ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nena,</hi> which containe in them poisons hauing the titles of remedies: but <hi>really</hi> and truely, one that is so indeed, and to speake plaine English, <hi>a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rue Christian.</hi> The second in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation is, <hi>if any will come after me,</hi> that is, <hi>if any will arriue at that end to the which I am aspiring before him,</hi> namely, <hi>eternall glory.</hi> Neither is this vnlikely: for <hi>Christ

                     <hi>if any will come to eternall life and glory after me.</hi> Now whether of these two sences shall we take? I suppose both: for first the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of the Text admit both, secondly both agree with the analogie of faith, thirdly the safest rule is, not to straighten but to enlarge the meaning of the holy <hi>Ghost</hi> as much as may be: and lastly what God hath ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let no man put asunder. Now no man can bee a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen of heauen, vnlesse he be a Disciple of Christ here on earth. The Schoole of Christ and the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are contriued like <hi>Marcellus</hi> two Temples of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> and <hi>Honour.</hi> For as none could enter into the Temple of <hi>Honour</hi> but he must first passe through the Temple of <hi>Vertue:</hi> so neither can any man passe into the kingdome of <hi>glory</hi> but by the schoole of <hi>grace.</hi> He that will be <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> there must first be <hi>gracious</hi> here. There is no salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but only by the <hi>Mediation</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> his <hi>Mediation</hi> stands in his <hi>Priesthood, Kingdome,</hi> and <hi>Prophecie.</hi> Hee is not a <hi>Priest</hi> to one, a <hi>King</hi> to another, and a <hi>Prophet</hi> to a third, but he is all three vnto a man, or he is none at all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.13.</note> for <hi>Christ is not divided.</hi> Whence it followeth that whosoeuer will be saued, <hi>Christ must bee a Prophet</hi> vnto him, and he must be a <hi>Disciple</hi> vnto Christ. The meaning then of this condition is as if our Saviour more fully and plainely had said, <hi>If any will be my Disciple, and by being my Disciple will come vnto the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:23186:140"/>
after me.</hi> Now let vs descend in due order vnto the <hi>counsels,</hi> and consider both the <hi>substance</hi> and <hi>necessity</hi> of them. First of the first.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let him deny himselfe.</hi> What is that? <hi>God,</hi> saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, <hi>is faithfull, he cannot deny himselfe,</hi> that is, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say and vnsay,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.13.</note> for his promises are not <hi>Yea and nay,</hi> but <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi>: neither can he say otherwise of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe then he is, for he is <hi>truth</hi> it selfe &amp; cannot lye. Must we thus deny our selues? <hi>God forbid.</hi> For then how can we resemble our heavenly Father, and be <hi>perfect as hee is perfect</hi>? for he neither doth nor can deny himselfe. And seeing <hi>Christ is the expresse image of his Father,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 1.3.</note> and wee are to be conformed vnto the <hi>image of Christ:</hi> it cannot be that he should advise vs to bee so vnlike either to his Father or himselfe, as in this sense to deny our selues. No this we leaue to cheating <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Iesuits,</hi> who haue devised a new doctrine of <hi>Equivocation</hi> and <hi>Mentall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.</hi> If yee aske of a <hi>Priest,</hi> art thou a <hi>Priest?</hi> Hee will confidently and boldly deny himselfe and say, I am no <hi>Priest,</hi> reseruing in his minde, of <hi>Baal,</hi> or of <hi>Apollo,</hi> which speech and reservation put together, make vp, they say, one entire and true sentence, <hi>I am no Priest of Baal</hi> or <hi>Apollo.</hi> And this is the starting hole which these Foxes haue provided for themselues in the time of danger. But O thou thrice blessed Lord and Saviour Christ, and O yee blessed and holy <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Martyrs of Christ,</hi> how simple and ignorant were yee that yee knewe not this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine? Had you knowne it, how easily might you haue avoided those many troubles, vexations, and torments that yee endured? Thou O Christ being demanded whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou were the Christ, mightst readily haue answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>I am not,</hi> with this reservation, <hi>such as yee looke for</hi>: &amp;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:23186:141"/>
yee <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Martyrs of Christ</hi> being questioned whether yee were <hi>Christians,</hi> might easily haue replyed, <hi>we are not,</hi> reseruing only in your mind, <hi>such as yee slander vs to be, devourers of young children, incestuous,</hi> and the like. But the schoole of <hi>Machiavel</hi> and <hi>Loiola</hi> was not yet opened, and Christians hitherto were trained vp on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the schoole of Christ: all were of the minde of that Bishop, who as <hi>Augustin</hi> saith, was <hi>Firme</hi> both in name and deed, who being demanded by persecutors for a Christian whom he had hidden, answered roundly and without all <hi>Equivocation,</hi> neither is it for a Christian to lie, nor for a Bishop to betray a Christian and therefore I will not tell you. I feare me, when these <hi>Deniers</hi> of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues shall appeare before Christ at the last day, <hi>mentall reseruation</hi> will hardly excuse them: and because they would not be knowne to be the Priests of Christ (for so they pretend) neither will Christ knowe them to bee of his flocke. But of this enough, being but by the way.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>Deny</hi> then in this place, is not litterally and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to be vnderstood, but thus, <hi>to disclaime, to renounce, to reiect, to despise, to make no reckoning and to take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of.</hi>

                     <hi>euen his eternall Power and Godhead are clearely scene</hi>: &amp; there is no nation so barbarous, but part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by inbred principles, partly by the booke of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures knowe him.

Finally, even in the matter of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> reason seeth thus farre, that it is not vnpossible if God will: and vpon this ground, <hi>Iustin Martyr, Tertullian, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobius, Lactantius, Athenagoras, Augustin</hi> anciently, and <hi>Aquinas, Vives, Mornay</hi> of late, haue attempted to proue by reason, the <hi>truenesse of Christian religion.</hi> As for the <hi>Will,</hi> it is yeelded of all hands, that in matters morally good, it hath free liberty, and may of it selfe either chuse it or refuse it at pleasure. So that hitherto <hi>Nature</hi> &amp; the power thereof is no way to bee <hi>denied</hi> or disclaimed. Wherein then? Surely in things meerely supernaturall.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be attained only by the power of nature. <hi>The naturall man,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul, perceaueth not the things of God, nor can knowe them,</hi>

Search the writings of the subtilest and sharpest <hi>Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list,</hi> and ye shall finde in them of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Gospell</hi> nor palme nor footstep. Here therefore reason must bee deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and as a woman may not speake in the <hi>Church,</hi> so must reason also be silent in things supernaturall. In things not revealed, it must be contented not to know: <hi>&amp; docta igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantia est,</hi> it is a learned ignorance. In things revealed, it must beleeue without and aboue reason: reason must bee captived vnto the obedience of faith. And as where the naturall <hi>Philosopher</hi> endeth there the <hi>Physitian</hi> begins: so where <hi>naturall reason</hi> stoppeth divine <hi>Faith</hi> must come in place. Otherwise if <hi>reason</hi> will needs be prying into <hi>Gods</hi> arke, and search into those mysteries that are aboue the reach thereof: it is the corruption of reason, and no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile if it become vaine and foolish in her imaginations. Yea when men in their curiosity thinke themselues most wise, then are they most infatuated. And as <hi>Ixion,</hi> in the fable, embraceing a cloud insteed of <hi>Iuno</hi> begat <hi>Centaures</hi> thereon: so they entertaining their owne fancies insteed of divine veritie bring forth nothing but monsters of errors and strange opinions. What I say of <hi>reason</hi> must be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the <hi>will</hi> also: in spirituall matters the one want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth light to see, and the other strength to doe: <hi>It is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but in God that sheweth mercy:</hi> for (as we haue already demonstrated) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we will of our selues without preventing grace, nor doe when wee haue willed without pursuing grace. So that if a man will be no more then the scholler of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> he cannot be the scholler of <hi>Christ.</hi> For as nature is vnable both to know the mysteries which <hi>Christ</hi> teacheth and to doe the duties which he requireth: so doth <hi>Christ</hi> command vs to renounce our naturall abilities, &amp; to come

                  <p>But if <hi>Nature</hi> it selfe must be denied, much more the <hi>Corruption</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi> For as the <hi>Scripture</hi> saith <hi>Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot inherit vncorruption: and without holinesse it is impossible to see God.</hi> Now the leprosie of <hi>Originall Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption</hi> not only infects the inferiour part of the soule as <hi>Papists</hi> dreame, but spreads it selfe to every part, even the superiour also.

                  </p>
                  <p>The second is, <hi>let him take vp his crosse daily.</hi> The <hi>Crosse</hi> properly is a tree or engine of wood framed into such a forme, where vpon malefactors were wont to bee executed and put to death. The manner was either with cords to bind them, or which was more vsuall with nailes to fasten them hand and foot vnto it, and there to suffer them to languish and pine away vnto death: in regard whereof they were wont aunciently to call it <hi>vltimum supplicium,</hi> the extremest and greatest punishment: &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:23186:144"/>
the basest sort of people only, and such as were ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants or slaues were in this manner executed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was it also termed <hi>servile supplicium</hi> a servile pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. This cruell and slavish death did our <hi>Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ</hi> suffer, to free vs from eternall death, and to procure vnto vs everlasting life. Wherevpon those pressures, tribulations, afflictions, persecutions that doe befall a man, not for his wickednesse but for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse sake, &amp; for the profession of the Gospell of Christ, are in the language of <hi>Canaan</hi> called the <hi>Crosse,</hi> because they are the <hi>remainders of the afflictions of Christ,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 1.24.</note> which he in his body, that is <hi>the Church,</hi> doth yet still suffer. And this is the <hi>Crosse</hi> which is here meant. But it is further said, <hi>His crosse.</hi> Not that <hi>Crosse</hi> which a man frameth vnto his owne selfe, or rashly pulleth vpon himselfe, as sundry <hi>Martyrs</hi> in the primitiue Church seemed to doe, whom yet I dare not censure, because I know not with what spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit they did it. For we may not like <hi>Coecias</hi> draw stormes and clouds vpon our owne heads: and our <hi>Saviour</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe advizeth vs, <hi>when they persecute vs in one Citty, to fly into another.</hi> Then only are we bound to beare the <hi>crosse,</hi> when without denying the truth we cannot avoid it. Our <hi>Crosse</hi> then is that which is imposed vpon vs by God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be poverty, or ignominy, or imprisonment, or ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, or whipping, or racking, or torment, or death of what kind soeuer. For God layeth not the same <hi>crosse</hi> on all, but one <hi>Crosse</hi> on one, and another on another, as hee in his wisdome thinketh best. But whatsoever the <hi>crosse</hi> is which God appointeth vnto a man, that is <hi>his crosse.</hi> And this <hi>crosse</hi> saith Christ <hi>must be taken vp.</hi> It was the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that he that was <hi>cruciarius</hi> to bee crucified, was to beare his <hi>crosse</hi> or some part thereof vnto the place of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:23186:144"/>
So did Christ, vntill meeting with <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene, they compelled him to beare his crosse.</hi> But malefactors beare it against their wills, our <hi>Saviour</hi> willingly, which was the very forme of his suffering: and he requireth all those that <hi>will come after him</hi> to doe so too. For to <hi>take vp the crosse</hi> imports not only a patient bearing of it when it is laid vpon vs, but also a ready and voluntary vndergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. And this also saith our Saviour, must bee done <hi>daily,</hi> that is, at all times, and continually. Not but that the <hi>Church</hi> hath sometimes her <hi>lucida intervalla,</hi> her good daies: for the <hi>rod of the wicked</hi> resteth not alwaies <hi>vpon the lot of the righteous,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 125.3.</note> and after stormes and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests God sendeth calme &amp; <hi>Halcionian</hi> times. How then? Thus. Whensoever God sendeth the <hi>crosse</hi> vnto any, he must actually <hi>take it vp</hi>: in the time of peace, and when there is no <hi>crosse,</hi> though actually he cannot, yet must he take it vp in the preparation and disposition of the mind. And this is the substance of the second Counsell, <hi>Let him take vp his crosse daily.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Necessity</hi> of it if wee will come after <hi>Christ</hi> is easie to be demonstrated. What more manifest in the <hi>Scripture</hi> then this that the <hi>Crosse</hi> is an vnseparable companion of the <hi>Church?</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>Lilium inter spinas,</hi> a lilie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thornes. <hi>Christ</hi> without his <hi>crosse</hi> is but a <hi>Chimoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> &amp; so is the Church also without <hi>afflictions,</hi>

And indeed as long as <hi>Satan</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth to be malitious against vs, how can it be otherwise? Knowing himselfe to be eternally reiected, and without redemption, he beareth an eternall hatred against <hi>God.</hi> And because he cannot wreake his teene vpon him, being out of his reach: he turneth his malice against mankind, and among them those principally who by Christ are conquered out of his hands.

                     <hi>salvation,</hi> the paucity of good <hi>christians</hi> and them that shall be saued. Is it an easy thing thinke you for a <hi>man to deny himselfe,</hi> that is, to pull out the eyes as it were of his owne head, and then to giue his hand to another to lead him which way soever he pleaseth? to renounce his owne will, and to yeeld blind obedience vnto the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of another? Is it so easy a matter <hi>to take vp the crosse daily,</hi> that is, to forsake, to abandon, to lothe, and detest the delights and comforts of this life, and whatsoever is dearest vnto vs, and in the meane season to be hated, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, and troden vnder foot of all? yea in the midst of the cruellest persecutions and torments, to reioyce as if we were bathing in the greatest pleasures, and to giue thankes as if we had receiued some inestimable benefit? Finally, is it so easie to <hi>follow Christ,</hi> that is, to disclaime our owne lusts and desires, and leauing the broad and beaten way which all men almost walke in, finding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in great contentment, to imitate Christ in a strict and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere course of life, so irkesome to the flesh and so odious to the World? They are deceiued then who thinke to dance on roses, or to be carried to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on a featherbed. No, <hi>Christianity</hi> is not <hi>Libertinisme</hi> nor <hi>Epicurisme.

                  <p>O the paucity also? How few good <hi>Christians</hi> are there? <hi>how few are there that shall bee saved?</hi> Every one would willingly attaine the end, everlasting life: but they are loath to endure the roughnesse of the way which leads vnto the end.

                  <p>But although it be so hard thus to <hi>come after Christ,</hi> yet is it not impossible: and although but few doe thus come, yet is it not in <hi>Christ</hi> that more come not, but in themselues. Let vs therefore in the name of God quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp our dull spirits, and striue what wee can to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all difficulties. On our part nothing is required but <hi>Willingnesse</hi> and <hi>Endeavour:</hi> the rest God of his grace will supply. To worke in vs a <hi>Willingnesse,</hi> I suppose it will not be amisse seriously to consider, first, as touching the <hi>Deniall of our selues,</hi> what we are by <hi>nature,</hi> &amp; thence to learne <hi>Humilitie</hi>: that in vs there is no good at all, <hi>that of our selues we cannot so much as thinke a good thought,</hi> much lesse performe any action pleasing and acceptable vnto God. Our minde is blinde, our will is vnable, and as our Saviour saith, <hi>without him we can doe nothing.</hi> Why
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:23186:150"/>
should we then proudly &amp; vainely stand vpon our selues? Nay rather why should we not in all humility vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny our selues? Secondly, as touching the <hi>Crosse</hi> and the <hi>taking vp of it,</hi> that although it bee in it selfe bitter and greevous, yet the end is sweet and glorious, even an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible crowne of glory. So we may attaine eternall blessednesse, what mattereth it though we passe through rough and tempestuous seas vnto it? Were it not far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for vs with <hi>Lazarus</hi> to suffer affliction for a short sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son here, and after to receaue eternall comfort in heaven: then with the rich glutton to enioy the pleasures of this present life and afterward to be everlastingly tormented in hell? If we suffer for Christ, he will be in the <hi>fierie fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace</hi> with vs, and refresh vs with the sweet comforts of his <hi>blessed spirit.</hi> He hath willingly borne the Crosse for vs: and why should not we willingly take vp our Crosse for him. As touching the last, which is our <hi>Following of Christ</hi> know wee it is our safest course absolutely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe our selues into his hands. He is farre wiser then we are, as being the very <hi>wisdome of his Father:</hi> and therefore knoweth both what is best for vs, and how to provide for vs better then we our selues. Againe, his loue is far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then ours either is or can be towards vs. The heathen <hi>Poet</hi> even by the light of nature could say <hi>Charior est illis homo quam sibi,</hi> Man is more deare to God then to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: but the light of revelation demonstrateth it more fully in that out of his infinite loue he gaue his only sonne for vs. His loue then being such, it cannot be but that hee is most willing to doe vs the best good hee can. Now what his wisdome and loue resolue concerning vs, his power is able to effect: for he is omnipotent, and nothing is impossible vnto him. What then should let but that it
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:23186:151"/>
is our safest course to make a perfect surrender of our selues vnto him? If we be left vnto our owne selues, wee are ever in danger, and in the end shall surely perish, but being <hi>Christs</hi> and <hi>following him,</hi> wee can neuer miscarry nor doe amisse. All these things being duly weighed &amp; considered are sufficient to make vs willing: willing I say to <hi>deny our selues, to take vp our crosse daily, and to follow Christ.</hi> Vnto which <hi>Willingnesse</hi> if wee further adde our owne <hi>Endeauour,</hi> doing what lieth in our power, <hi>confecta res est,</hi> we shall surely <hi>come after Christ,</hi> that is, bee his schollers here, and raigne with him for ever hereafter. Without trauell and labour, nothing can bee had in this world: much lesse will the kingdome of heauen be obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with sitting still and doing nothing. <hi>No it must suffer violence, &amp; violent men must take it by force:</hi> which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer shall doe, he shall never fayle of it. Christ will <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct</hi> him by his <hi>word, guid</hi> him by his <hi>spirit, protect</hi> him with his <hi>providence, gard</hi> him with his <hi>Angels,</hi> and ever <hi>pursue</hi> him with his <hi>grace</hi> vntill he haue brought him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end of his hopes, even the eternall saluation of his soule. Vnto the which the Lord bring vs all for his <hi>Christs</hi> sake. AMEN.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough the good in regard of Gods knowledge and their owne affection are chosen out of the world &amp; separated from the wicked: yet are they not remoued out of the world, but still remaine therein, mixed with them in place and conversation. So that the Church of God while it is militant here on earth is no other then a floore wherein is both chaffe and wheat, a field both of corne &amp; cockle, a net containing both good and bad fishes, a flocke consisting both of sheep &amp; goats: and shall so continue vntill the fanning time come, vntill the harvest be cut, vntill the net be drawne to the shore, vntill the high shepheard survey his flocke, but they shall eternally then be divided one from another, &amp; be ranged into severall places, the one into a place of refreshment &amp; everlasting ioy, the other into a place of torment &amp; ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting woe. In the meane season both good and bad be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

embarked as it were together in the same vessell, how can the good escape the common shipwracke of humane calamitie? Or being enwrapt in the same punishment, with the wicked, how is God iust? <hi>Abraham the father of the faithfull,</hi> &amp; a man of deepe vnderstanding in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of Gods providence, yet stood astonished hereat in <hi>Sodoms</hi> case: where <hi>righteous Lot,</hi> and for ought hee knew divers other holy men dwelling, he marvelled how it might stand with the iustice of God in the destruction thereof to involue both righteous and wicked together, and therefore saith according to my Text, <hi>Bee it far from thee from doing this thing.</hi> A point, as you see, of great importance, and as will evidently appeare by the sequele, every way worthy our present consideration, which was the cause why I made choice thereof at this time. God grant vnto vs the assistance of his <hi>blessed spirit</hi> that wee may handle it as it deserueth, and that it may bee vnto vs as profitable as it is pertinent.</p>
                  <p>All that I haue now to say touching these words may be reduced vnto these three heads, <hi>Gods action, Abrahams affection, Abrahams argument. Gods action,</hi> how hee dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth with these mixt societies consisting both of good &amp; bad. <hi>Abrahams affection</hi> how hee standeth affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. <hi>Abrahams argument,</hi> which so much sway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his owne affection, and whereby hee would perswade God also to be of his minde. <hi>Gods action</hi> is intimated &amp; implied generally, through the whole Text, in the words going before it in the twentieth and one and twentieth verses, wherein God acquainted <hi>Abraham</hi> how he meant to proceede with <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha. Abrahams affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is plainely declared in the <hi>Deprecation</hi> he maketh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for them. His <hi>argument</hi> is expresly set downe in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:23186:153"/>
these words, <hi>Shall not the iudge of the whole world doe right?</hi> Which being a question propounded negatiuely, is to be vnderstood as an affirmatiue proposition, thus, <hi>The judge of the whole world must needs doe right.</hi> Of these things briefly and in order.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>actions</hi> of God in this case are not alwaies one &amp; the same, but as his <hi>Wisdome</hi> is (to vse the Apostles word) <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> full of variety, so are his <hi>actions</hi> also manifold yet alwaies iust. For iustice is vnto God, not <hi>accidentall</hi> as it is vnto man, but <hi>essentiall</hi> and inseparable, so that hee can no more doe that which is vniust, then cease to bee that which eternally and necessarily hee is, namely <hi>God.</hi> First then, so great loue beareth God vnto his deare Saints and children, that the wicked among whom they liue oftentimes fare the better for them, and their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall prosperitie and deliuerance from dangers is to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted vnto them. Was not wicked <hi>Cham</hi> preserued in the Arke from that deluge which overwhelmed the whole earth for his good father <hi>Noahs</hi> sake? Were not the sinfull <hi>Sodomites</hi> reskued out of the hands of their enimies by the sword of <hi>Abraham</hi> for righteous <hi>Lots</hi> sake? If fiftie, if fortie, if thirtie, if twentie, nay if but ten iust men might haue beene found in <hi>Sodom,</hi> had they not escaped that fearefull storme of fire &amp; brimstone which after fell from heauen vpon them, even for tennes sake? What speak I of ten?<note place="margin">Ps. 106.23.</note> One <hi>Moses</hi> standing in the <hi>breach before God, turned away his wrath, so that he did not destroy his people Israel.</hi> And God himselfe by the Prophet <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> saith thus,<note place="margin">Ier. 5.1.</note> 
                     <hi>Run to and fro by the streets of Ierusalem, &amp; behold now and knowe, and inquire in the open places there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of if yee can finde a man, or if there bee any that executeth judgement and seeketh the truth and I will spare it.</hi> Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

wherevnto as it is recorded by S. <hi>Luke, all those that sailed with S. Paul</hi> being in number <hi>two hundred seaventy and six soules,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 27.24.34.37.</note> 
                     <hi>were giuen vnto him,</hi> that not one of them in that exceeding dangerous tempest lost so much as a haire from his head. When <hi>Augustus</hi> the <hi>Emperour</hi> had conquered <hi>Mark Antonie,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plut. Ant.</note> and taken the Citie of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> and the Citizens looked for nothing but extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the Emperour in the hearing of them all freely par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned them for <hi>Arius</hi> sake, a Philosopher of that Citie, one whom he honoured much for his learning, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for his vertue. If the heathen who knowe not God can for one friends sake remit the offences of many: shall not God doe much more for their sakes whom he calleth and counteth his friends? Certainely hee will. <hi>Egypt</hi> shall fare the better for <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and the very remembrance of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> shall moue God to persist in doing good to their rebellious posterity. The charity of the Saints towards the wicked is very great, and the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers they make vnto God for them are many, and so avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able are they that by them oftentimes the arme of God is held from striking them, oftentimes his hand is opened to blesse them. And thus sometimes God prospereth evill men for a few good mens sakes that liue among them,</p>
                  <p>Sometimes againe hee dealeth otherwise with these mixt companies, and when he punisheth a wicked nation, nor will be perswaded to spare them, hee preserueth the godly that they tast not of the common calamitie. For sometime he preventeth them by death, and taketh them into his rest before the misery come. Thus all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers died before the floud came vpon the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and good <hi>Iosiah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. King. 22.18.19.20.</note> according to the prediction of <hi>Huldah</hi> the

prophetesse, <hi>was gathered to his fathers and laid in his graue in peace</hi> that his eyes might not behold all the evill which God resolued to bring vpon his kingdome. For as it is in the booke of <hi>Wisdome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sap 4.14.16.19.</note> 
                     <hi>Because the Lord loueth the soule of the righteous, therefore he hastneth to take them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the wicked</hi>: and, <hi>the righteous that is dead con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth the vniust man that is liuing, for God will shake his foundations and lay him vtterly wast, they shall be in sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and their memoriall perish.</hi> So that as it is a great signe that <hi>God</hi> intends to continue his mercies to a nation while as good men remaine among them, according to that of old. <hi>Althes</hi> in the Poet: <hi>Non tamen omnino Teucros del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <note place="margin">Virg. Aen. l. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Cum tales animos iuvenum &amp; tam certa tulistis Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctora,</hi> I see God hath not determined vtterly to destroy the <hi>Troians,</hi> seeing such valiant hearts and braue spirits still rise vp among them: so is it as great a token of immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent destruction when the good are taken away, and as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">Psal. 74.9.</note> 
                     <hi>their signes</hi> are no longer to be seene among them. Now as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sometimes hee preventeth the righteous by death that they partake not in the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the wicked: so sometimes hee prolongeth their life to see it, but withall sendeth them strange and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous deliverance that they feele it not. Thus was <hi>Noah</hi> delivered by an Arke when all the rest of the world were drowned. <hi>Lot</hi> and his family by a gard of Angells, when <hi>Sodom</hi> and the neighbour Citties were consumed, <hi>Israel</hi> by a speciall protection when the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were many waies plagued, <hi>Rahab</hi> by a cord of red thred when all the rest of the soule in <hi>Ierico</hi> were put to the sword, the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> by oracle at <hi>Pella,</hi> in the generall vastity and deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Iudea.</hi> So that <hi>God</hi> knoweth well how to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate betweene <hi>the pretious and the vile,</hi> and in the greatest
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:23186:155"/>
perplexities if he please can find an issue and enlargement for all such as he loueth.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit almighty <hi>God</hi> doth not alwaies thus deliuer his <hi>Saints,</hi> but sometimes involueth both good and bad in the same calamity. And even as the evill because they are mingled with the good partake with them of temporall benefits as the shining of the Sun, &amp; the showres of raine: so the good also because they are mingled with the evill partake with them in temporall afflictions. <hi>Aliquid mali propter vicinum malum,</hi> the neighbourhood of evill can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but worke them some evill. Both good and bad are one common flesh, &amp; <hi>common flesh</hi> as <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith <hi>is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the same common inconveniences,</hi> and ever will be vntill <hi>corruption be swallowed vp of incorruption.</hi> Hence is it that in the time of famine or pestilence there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon mortality, in hostile impressions and conquests a common captivity, in shipwracke at sea a common drowning. If then the <hi>Sodomites</hi> loose the day and bee made prisoners vnto <hi>Chedor-laomer,</hi> so is <hi>Lot</hi> also: if <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Babilon</hi> lead away the <hi>Iewes</hi> into captivity, <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Ezechiell,</hi> and the three children are lead away also. If <hi>Totilas</hi> overflow <hi>Europe</hi> with his barbarous troopes, Christians are not freer then Gentiles. <hi>Behold,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 21.3.</note> saith the <hi>Lord</hi> by the prophet <hi>Ezechiell, I come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee, and will draw my sword out of his sheath, and cut off from thee both the righteous and the wicked.</hi> Also by Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> he straitly chargeth his people to depart out of <hi>Babylon</hi> least they be partakers in her <hi>plagues.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 18.4.</note> Nay if one <hi>Achan</hi> only trespasse in the execrable thing,<note place="margin">Ios. 7.1. &amp;c.</note> hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone perisheth not, but wrath falleth on the <hi>whole congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> which the heathen poet also obseruing said <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:23186:155"/>
whole citty smarts for the offence of one. But this speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if any publike man commit some notorious wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: for as when the head akes or is distempered, the arme vaine many times is opened, so for the offence of Kings and Princes, the people oftentimes are punished, as appeares in <hi>Davids</hi> case for whose sinne in numbering the people seaventy thousand of his subiects perished.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24.</note> That all these were wicked men, and that none of them feared <hi>God,</hi> it is both vnreasonable and vncharitable to imagine: and therefore not doubting but that good and bad pell mell were cut off in that pestilence, I conclude this point with that <hi>aphorisme</hi> of the <hi>Rabbins, When once the sentence of punishment is pronounced and resolued by God, and power is given to the destroyer to execute the same, he from thence respecteth the person of no man, nor putteth difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the iust and the vniust.</hi> And thus yee see how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly <hi>God</hi> dealeth with these mixt societies: let vs before we proceed vnto the next point, make some vse of what hath beene deliuered.</p>
                  <p>First then doe the wicked fare the better for the godly that liue among them? and are their prosperities and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances to bee imputed vnto them? Oh then the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame folly, Oh the monstrous ingratitude of wicked men: folly in imputing all the crosses and evills that befall them vnto the godly, as in old time the gentiles did to the Christians, and nowadaies <hi>Papists</hi> doe to <hi>Protestants</hi>: ingratitude, in requiting the much good they enioy by them with nothing else but hatred and persecution. Well doth <hi>Solomon</hi> confound <hi>Fooles</hi> and <hi>Wicked:</hi> for were not wicked men meere fooles they would neuer thus malice their best friends, nor seeke to destroy them by whom themselues are preserved from destruction. For certainly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:23186:156"/>
will they nill they <hi>sapiens est stulti redemptio,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De sacrif. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel. &amp; Cain.</note> the wise man is the fooles ransome, as saith <hi>Philo,</hi> and iust men are the pillers of the house, the brazen walls of a country, <hi>the charets and horsemen</hi> of a nation, without whom the world is but a stage of vanity, &amp; a cage of vncleane birds, &amp; cannot long subsist. Wherefore although to our griefe we see wicked men too thicke sowne among vs, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause so many good men are mingled with them, let vs reioyce and be glad &amp; giue <hi>God</hi> hearty thankes for them, hoping that while they continue with vs, <hi>Gods</hi> blessing shall continue vpon vs also. And when it shall please him to translate any of them from hence, let vs solicite him with our devoutest prayers, <hi>vt vno avulso suppullulet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Aureus &amp; simili frondescat virga metallo,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Virg. Aen. 6.</note> the one branch being pluckt off, another golden one may grow vp in the place thereof for the perpetuation of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours towards vs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, doth <hi>God</hi> in executing iudgement distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish betweene good and bad, sparing the one and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the other? here is a right precedent for you my <hi>Lords</hi> and other <hi>iudges,</hi> and <hi>rulers</hi> of the land to imitate. Yee are in scripture stiled <hi>Gods,</hi> and in this principally are yee to resemble <hi>God.</hi> Ye are carefully to separate betwixt the <hi>pretious and the vile,</hi> not so as to iustifie the wicked, and to condemne the innocent, for both <hi>are an abomination to the Lord,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon</hi>: but to <hi>punish the evill doers, and to praise them that doe well, for to this end are ye sent,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Peter</hi> saith.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.14.</note> There is no greater cause either of apostasie in the Church or of sedition in the commonwealth, then when they that deserue well of both are vilipended or neglected, and lewd vnworthy men are honoured with the reward due vnto vertue. Oh therefore let vertuous
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:23186:156"/>
worthy men find grace in your eyes, let them in the name of <hi>God</hi> be cherished and countenanced by you, ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring that they are the meanes of much good vnto the place where they liue. As for wicked men, bend your browes vpon them, and as they deserue it let them feele the edge of your sword. <hi>Pinguior victima mactari Deo non potest quam homo sceleratus</hi>:<note place="margin">Sen.</note> a fatter sacrifice can yee not kill vnto God then a wicked man. If yee spare him yee spare not your owne selues: <hi>judex ipse damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur cum nocens absolvitur,</hi> the iudge himselfe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned when the guilty person is absolved. And seeing so many <hi>Amorites</hi> yet remaining in the land, &amp; they now begin to pricke sorer in our sides then heretofore, hoping for a linsey wolsey Church at least ere long: it is high time for you to looke carefully herevnto. <hi>Tranquillitas est vbi solus Petrus navigat, tempestas vbi Iudas adiungi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> saith <hi>Ambrose,</hi> if <hi>Peter</hi> saile alone all is calme, if <hi>Iudas</hi> saile with him nought but storme and tempest. If we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not vtterly be rid of them, let them be hewers of wood &amp; drawers of water with the <hi>Gibeonits:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ios. 9 27.</note> God forbid they should steere at the helme, and be proud commanders.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly and lastly, doth <hi>God</hi> sometimes enwrap both good and bad in the same punishment? This my Lords, is a mysterie vnimitable, and farre aboue your reach: and to follow God in such actions were to make your selues as ridiculous as little children, who will needs put vpon them their fathers coats though they be no way propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable vnto them. <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Emperour for the fault of one man at <hi>Thessalonica</hi> involved many innocents into the same punishment, but hee was faine to doe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for it before he could be receiued into the Church by Saint <hi>Ambrose.</hi> If Polititians thinke they see reason of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:23186:157"/>
state in it, yet policy must yeeld to religion, the rule whereof is <hi>Fiat iustitia &amp; ruant coeli,</hi> evill may not bee done that good may come of it. For the least evill of fault is greater then the greatest evill of punishment, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evill in nature, this only to sence, otherwise an act of iustice it selfe. Neverthelesse, albeit this act of <hi>God</hi> be not to be imitated by vs, yet seeing the wicked by reason of their mixture with the Godly draw downe common plagues vpon them both: it ought to be our wisdome first to labour for their conversion, and if it may be, to worke them into Gods favour: then, if this cannot bee effected, either to separate them from vs by the hand of iustice, or to separate our selues from them at least wise in dislike &amp; affection.<note place="margin">Prov. 13.20.</note> For as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>He that walketh with the wise shall be wise, but a companion of fooles shall be afflicted.</hi> And thus much of the first part, which is <hi>Gods action</hi>: now of the second which is <hi>Abrahams affection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How <hi>Abraham</hi> stands affected in this particular case of <hi>Sodom</hi> is cleare and evident by his words, <hi>Be it farre</hi> saith he, <hi>from thee to doe this thing, to stay the righteous with the wicked, and that the righteous should be even as the wicked: be it farre from thee.</hi> He vtterly mislikes that the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous should perish together with the wicked: and desires rather that <hi>God</hi> would be pleased either to spare the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Sodomites</hi> for those righteous ones which happily were among them, or else to deliver the righteous from the destruction of the wicked. In a word he seemes to be solicitous for them all, both for the <hi>Sodomites</hi> whether good or evill in generall, and in particular for his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Lot</hi> who dwelt among them. But here it will happily be said, what? doth <hi>Abraham</hi> prescribe vnto God &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a law vpon him? Is God to be ruled by man, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:23186:157"/>
divine actions to be directed by humane affections?

                  <p>It will peradventure yet farther be said, that <hi>God</hi> had already signified his purpose vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and what he meant to doe. Which being so, it had beene his dutie to laid his hand vpon his mouth, and to haue rested in his will, without farther contradiction or opposition. And here <hi>caeca obedientia,</hi> blinde and absolute obedience is as necessary &amp; commendable, as in Friars to their superiours it is foolish and vnreasonable. To this I answere, that <hi>God</hi> indeed had intimated his purpose vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi> but yet in this forme of words,<note place="margin">Vers. 20 21.</note> 
                     <hi>Because the cry of Sodom and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah is great, and because their sinne is exceeding grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous.

Neither doth that appeare by the words that <hi>God</hi> had past an absolute and peremptory sentence against the wicked <hi>Sodomites</hi>: for if ten righteous men had beene

found amongst them they had beene spared: and the threatnings of <hi>God</hi> ordinarily are to be vnderstood with a condition annexed vnto them, if men repent not, yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be not in plaine tearmes expressed, as in that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Niniveh, yet forty daies &amp; Niniveh shall be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> for this notwithstanding vpon their repentance they were not destroyed. So that this condition being here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so vnderstood, what presumption could it be in <hi>Abraham</hi> to desire favour for the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> at least vpon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Finally had <hi>God</hi> absolutely threatned, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out condition, yet ought not man so much to attend what God intendeth to doe agreeable vnto his owne will and iustice, as what he himselfe is to doe agreeable to the law of God, and nature: and then shall he find that <hi>God</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing and executing iudgement wills two things, both that they perish and that he greeue. <hi>God</hi> had laid <hi>Iudea</hi> wast and sent away the inhabitants thereof into captivity, yet <hi>Ieremy</hi> lamented for it. <hi>Christ</hi> knew well that <hi>God</hi> had absolutely determined to destroy <hi>Ierusalem, yet hee wept over it:</hi> a sonne may know by evident symptomes that his Father cannot liue, and yet desire the prolonging of his life, and all without sinne. In like manner might <hi>Abraham</hi> without offence wish all good vnto the <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> notwithstanding Gods will vnto the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Now this affection of this <hi>holy Patriarch</hi> is iustifiable both by the law of God and nature, hauing a three fold foundation to support it, <hi>Humanitie, Consanguinitie, Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> First <hi>Humanity</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for what heart of flint or adamant would not melt to behold so many thousands so fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to perish?

                  <p>The third and last ground of <hi>Abrahams</hi> affection was <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Piety.</hi> For where there is a profession of the same true religion there is a straiter bond then that of bloud, being members of the same mysticall body in <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi>

both what it is, and by what grounds it is justified &amp; warranted. Let vs apply this before we proceede farther.</p>
                  <p>As we all professe our selues to be the children of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> according to the faith, so is it our duty also to be his children in affection. And first, even towards the wicked ought wee to be tenderly affected, and to pittie them more then they pitty themselues. Thus doth <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> in this place: thus did <hi>David</hi> a true son of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, when they were sicke,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 35.13.</note> saith he, <hi>I clothed my selfe with sacke cloath, and humbled my soule with fasting.</hi> Thus did <hi>Christ</hi> a true sonne both of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> he wept for the miseries which he foresaw would fall vpon them, and for preventing of them, often would he <hi>haue gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them vnder his wings as the hen doth her chickens, but they would not:</hi> he, I say, would, and they would not.

                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, as no man, no not the wicked ought to bee strangers vnto our affection, so least of all those that are of the same faith with vs. Wee should be like <hi>Hippo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of man if but a finger ake all the rest of the members are sensible of it: &amp; can we be members of the mysticall body of <hi>Christ</hi> and haue no feeling of the miseries of our

brethren? If any man offer to strike at our head, the arme presently lifts it selfe to ward of the blow: and shall not we, if <hi>God</hi> shake the sword of his heavy displeasure against any of his children, speedily lift vp our hands vnto him, &amp; by the importunity of our prayers turne away the plague that it light not vpon them? Certainely they that are not touched with compassion in the dangers of <hi>Gods</hi> Saints are not the true Children of <hi>Abraham</hi>: and because they refused to be advocates for them in the day of need, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall themselues finde an advocate that will open his mouth to speake for them in the day of their extremity.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, seeing <hi>Abrahams</hi> desire is rather that evill men be spared then the good destroyed, and his hart inclineth so much vnto pittie, it lessons you, my Lords, also, that although through hope of impunity yee may not giue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to sinne, yet should you rather incline to too much mildnesse then severity. In doubtfull matters it is not only more iust but more safe also to follow the favourablest construction: and more Christian like is it in such a case to let the guilty escape then to condemne the innocent. It is much safer for a man to render account of his merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse then of his cruelty. <hi>Nero</hi> in his fiue first good yeares when he was to subscribe to the condemnation or execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any, was wont to say <hi>Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:23186:160"/>
it is better to cut off a part then to hazard that which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ound too. And so much for the second part which is <hi>Abrahams</hi> affection.</p>
                  <p>The third and last part is the <hi>Argument</hi> whereby hee would both warrant his owne affection, and perswade God to be of his minde, and is laid downe in these words <hi>Should not the iudge of the whole world doe right?</hi> that is as we haue shewed, <hi>the iudge of the whole world must needs doe right.</hi> The reason stands thus, To enwrap the good together with the wicked in the same punishment seemes not to be iust, and therefore neither maiest thou doe it, <hi>for thou art the iudge of the whole world &amp; must doe right.</hi> Surely if so to enwrap good and bad were vniust, God may not doe it and the argument followes necessarily. But is it vniust so to doe? <hi>Abraham</hi> seemes to make no doubt of it, for he goes not about to proue it, and yet we haue in the first part clearely demonstrated that God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes doth so. What then? is there any vniustice with God? God forbid: yea let <hi>him be iust in all his sayings &amp; cleare when he is iudged. In rebus divinis magna caligo,</hi> said <hi>Cato,</hi> in many of Gods actions there is so much obscurity that we see not the reasons of them; yet this is certaine, <hi>Occulta esse causa potest, iniusta esse non potest,</hi> the reason of them may be secret, but vniust it cannot be. For he is es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially iust, even iustice it selfe, and <hi>in rebus divinis ratio facti est voluntas facientis,</hi> in divine actions the will of the doer is sufficient to iustify the deed. For the will of God is the prime rule of iustice, and to seeke higher is to seeke a former then the first, which is meere folly, whereas therefore I finde a reason I will praise him, where I finde none I will admire him, and acknowledge my selfe that am but a bubble, but a shadow, but the dreame of a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:23186:161"/>
rather to faile in vnderstanding then God in iustice. Howbeit in this point we haue sufficient reason to cleare the iustice of <hi>God.</hi> For which of the Saints of God is without sinne? And which of them hath not deserved by sin to be severely punished? Suppose they liue vnblamably in the sight of men, yet the eye of <hi>God</hi> that trieth even the heart and raines beholdeth much folly and iniquity in them. Doe they not together with the wicked too much loue temporall things? Too much I say, though happily not so much? Doe they not liue too familiarly with them, never rebuking them nor shewing any dislike of their wicked courses? Questionlesse they doe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no marvell if partaking in the same sin, they partake also in the same punishment, <hi>et amara sentiant quia amari esse noluerunt,</hi> drinke with them of the same bitter cup, because for their amendment they would not bee sharpe and bitter vnto them.</p>
                  <p>The action of <hi>God</hi> being thus cleared from vniustice, what shall we say of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his assertion? I might dispatch him in a word and say <hi>let God be true and every man a lier</hi>: saue that I desire to dismisse him with all reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and as farre as I can to free him from blame also. Shall I say then with some, that he speaketh in the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of infidels who thinke it a high point of vniustice so to involue both good and bad together? I cannot: for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh not the father of the faithfull to presse vpon <hi>God</hi> the arguments of vnbeleeuers. Shall I say his meaning is, that it cannot every way and in all respects bee alike to both without vniustice? This indeed I confesse would be great vniustice: but <hi>God</hi> never suffers it to be so. <hi>Sub vno igni aurum rutilat, palea <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> argument is rather passionate then demonstratiue, yet such as holy men oftentimes vse in their devotions to <hi>God,</hi> and that without sin. <hi>Cast mee not off from thee,</hi> saith <hi>David.</hi> Why not? <hi>Because I am the workemanship of thy owne hands.</hi> The reason followeth not, for many such haue beene cast off. True: yet is it a motiue of affection; for what pittie is it for one to cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his owne workemanship. So in this case, Oh, saith <hi>Abraham,</hi> destroy not the righteous with the wicked: ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preserue the wicked for the righteous sake. Why so? Because the <hi>iudge of the whole World should doe righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously.</hi> It followeth not as we haue shewed. True, not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily: yet pittying the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> and hauing no better plea for so bad a people, he vsed it to stirre affection, alas that the righteous should be consumed with fire &amp; brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone from heauen together with the wicked, and that by
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:23186:162"/>
him who is the iudge of the whole world, &amp; should doe right. But whatsoever become of the <hi>Consequence</hi> and whethersoever it were either defect of iudgement or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of passion that framed it: sure I am the <hi>Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> which he layes for his foundation is sound &amp; good <hi>The iudge of the whole world should doe right,</hi> and of this briefly and in a word.</p>
                  <p>In all states and commonwealths for the better orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them, and that vice may be suppressed, and vertue maintained, and every man peaceably and quietly enioy his owne, Iudges are in severall places ordeined, to heare all causes, and according to iustice and equity to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them.

But how many villanies are there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the world which never come to the knowledge of the magistrate, and so escape without punishment? How many noble and vertuous actions are there done whereof no notice is taken, or if it be, yet the authors neither are nor will be knowne and so passe vnrewarded? Iudges themselues doe they not oftentimes either vpon errour and mistaking as men, or for fee and favour as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt men pervert iustice? If appeale be made vnto the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame power, what redresse? many times none at all, they being the worst of all men, witnesse <hi>Sardanapalus, Caligula, Nero, Heliogabalus,</hi> and the like.

wicked men liue and die without punishment? As for example that bloudy and sacrilegious tyrant of <hi>Sicilie Dionysius.</hi>

And how can I bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter demonstrate that the law <hi>Morall is written naturally in the heart,</hi> then by the testimony of those men who were never by grace elevated aboue nature?

What would he haue said, thinke you, if hee had heard <hi>Coton</hi> the French Iesuite preach of the <hi>Escalados</hi> of vertue, and the <hi>Barricados</hi> of greedy desire, and call Iesus Christ the <hi>Dolphin</hi> of heauen? Surely it is the language not of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>

but of <hi>Canaan</hi> which the holy Ghost hath sanctified for the preaching of the Gospell. Secondly I mislike that frothie conceits,, and wittie vanities should be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted learning. For true learning is substantiall and reall, bettering the vnderstanding, and making the heart wise: but these toyes stand only in seeming, tickling the eare, &amp; making the head giddy, but neuer feeding the soule.

                     </gap>, <hi>science falsely so called,</hi> which he would haue his <hi>Timothie</hi> carefully to avoid. Thirdly and lastly, it displeaseth me, that herein they propound to themselues, not Gods glory, or the edification of the Church, but their owne praise &amp; applause. To what end else this vaine ostentation, of wit, eloquence, reading, and all variety of learning? Wherein first they prevaricate with Christ, pretending to woo the soules of men vnto Christ, but indeed intending to win reputation to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. Secondly they fayle the hope and expectation of their brethren, who repairing to them for instruction, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue no more benefit by their Sermons, then <hi>Caligulas</hi> guests did by his golden banquet, which onely delighted the eye, but neither pleased the palate, nor satisfied the stomacke. Wise and wholsome is the counsell of S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, when thou teachest in the Church, non clamor populi sed gemitus suscitetur,</hi> stirre you vp not the applause but the grones of the people, <hi>lachrymae auditorum laudes tuae sint,</hi> let the teares of the auditory be thy praises.

                  <p>It is necessary also that we be <hi>Good men.</hi> Although in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth I see not how a man can be a <hi>Good Minister,</hi> vnlesse withall he be a <hi>Good man.</hi> For if he defined rightly who said that an <hi>Orator</hi> is <hi>vir bonus dicendi peritus,</hi> a good man skilfull in pleading: what should let but I may as truly say, a <hi>Good Minister</hi> is <hi>vir bonus docendi peritus,</hi> a good man well able to teach.

Must wee be simple as asses to beare all wrongs? Or make our selues as butts for every one to shoot the arrowes of his injuries against vs? Not so: for so doeing wee should but invite men to lay more load vpon vs then in the end we should bee able to beare. and if theeues, as the <hi>Poet</hi> speaketh, rise vp at midnight to rob and kill men, <hi>vt teipsum serves non ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pergisceris</hi>? should not wee speedily shift vs of our beds to saue and preserue our selues?

                  <p>That Serpents are naturally wise and subtill, <hi>Moses</hi> witnesseth saying <hi>that the Serpent was the subtilest beast of the field</hi>:<note place="margin">Gen. 3.1.</note> and the act of the Divell also argues as much in that he made speciall choice of the Serpent, as the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test instrument to beguile the Woman.

For first, if hee sees a Man whom hee knoweth to be his enimy, forthwith hee hastneth away into his hole to safegard himselfe. Secondly, if he cannot so escape, he foldeth all his traine about his head, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue it as wherein his life principally consisteth. Lastly, if enchanters goe about to charme him, hee layeth one of his eares close to the ground, and stoppeth the other with his taile, to the end he may not heare their charmes and callings, in regard whereof saith <hi>David, they are like the deafe adder that stoppeth his eare, which heareth not the voice of the inchanter though hee be most expert in charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> These and other such things shew his <hi>Defensiue wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>: so that the Serpent both <hi>offensiuely</hi> and <hi>defensiuely</hi> is very wise which is the <hi>Protasis</hi> or <hi>Proposition.</hi>

very instinct of nature command it vnto all creatures? We see how the hound flies before the hound, and vseth many naturall sleights and stratagems to escape the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: so doth the Partridge also to avoide the talons of the Falcon. Yea even in sencelesse creatures may wee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the same: The fire fleeth from the aire vpward to preserue it selfe in its element, and heavy things fall downeward as knowing they are not well till they are in their proper place. But in man it is much more seene: for even in suddaine perils when a man hath no leasure to thinke of avoiding them, if a blow bee reached at him, the hand naturally and of it selfe, will put it selfe forth or lift it selfe vp to guard him. And indeede to this end hath nature instilled into man a loue towards his owne selfe: for as the Philosopher saith <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>every man naturally is a friend to himselfe.</hi> Wherevpon the schoolemen say <hi>Charitas incipit a seipso,</hi> chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ever begins at a mans owne selfe: and where this selfe-loue is, it must needs breed a naturall desire to preserue himselfe. Besides this loue nature hath put into him feare also, feare of whatsoeuer evill would either hurt or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy him. Now feare as the same Philosopher teacheth is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> a preseruer: wherevpon the woman because she is ordained to keepe &amp; preserue things at home, is made more fearfull then the man. And for this cause also hath <hi>God</hi> put his feare into the heart of all his Saints to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue them from that horrible and dangerous sin of <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie</hi> and falling away from him, as the Prophet saith. So that <hi>Feare</hi> is as it were the sentinell of the heart, because danger maketh it vigilant, and the nature thereof is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>security.</hi> Lastly besides this loue and feare, there is in man an vnderstanding also and a memory, out of

which is bred <hi>Experience,</hi> and from experience pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the morall habit of Prudence, by which man is ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled against dangers both to foresee them and to prevent them. For <hi>Prudence,</hi> as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith, is <hi>ars vivendi vt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicina valetudinis,</hi> the art of liuing as physick is of health.

Neither dare I therefore nor will I adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vpon this argument farther then my text leads me, and that briefly, pointing only with my finger to the fountaines. <hi>Be wise,</hi> saith our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> as <hi>Serpents.</hi> How is that? First the <hi>Serpent</hi> by naturall instinct knowes man to be his mortall enimy, &amp; that principally he aimes at the breaking of his head, and therefore carefully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides for it. So should wee wisely seeke out who are ill affected towards vs, and which way they purpose to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault vs: that wee may bee the more able to prevent them. <hi>Sagitta praevisa facilius evitatur,</hi> the arrow foreseene is easily declined, and it is easy to countermine when wee know which way the mine is carried. Watchfulnesse then and observation is here required. Againe, the <hi>Serpent,</hi> as wee haue shewed, stops his eares because hee will not heare the enchanters charme. So should wee also turne
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:23186:190"/>
the deafe eare vnto the crafty insinuations of false &amp; trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous <hi>Sinons. Blessed is hee that feareth alwaies</hi> saith <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon:</hi> for <hi>distrust</hi> is the sinewes of wisdome saith the <hi>Poet, &amp; bonum est timere omnia vt nihil timeamus,</hi> it is good to feare all things that we may feare nothing. Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity is the bane of honest hearts, but it is wisdome <hi>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere Danaos &amp; dona ferentes,</hi> to feare an enimy speake he never so faire. Charity you will say is not suspitious: true, without a cause. But when there is cause, wisdome requireth vs to be <hi>Diffident and Distrustfull.</hi> Lastly the <hi>Serpent</hi> being assaulted vseth the best shift hee can either by couering his head, or by flight to saue himselfe. So should wee also in all dangers vse such lawfull meanes as are offered vs to free our selues. It is not sufficient to say <hi>Dij prohibebunt haec, God</hi> will helpe all: <hi>nunquam propter te de coelo descendent, tibi dent mentem oportet vt prohibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> if thou sit idle hee will never come downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to helpe thee, thou must haue a minde to helpe thy selfe. To pray vnto God for averting dangers without vsing the meanes is to tempt God, and to enwrap our selues farther into danger. But I will proceede no farther in this point, nor read a lecture of wisdome vnto those that are farre wiser then my selfe: and it may be some are liker to goe too farre then to come too short in these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.

So that all these things considered, <hi>Doue-like innocencie</hi> consisteth in these three things, first to doe no hurt, secondly to doe all good, thirdly to doe both with all sincerity. To doe no hurt that we be not vitious, to doe all good or else we are not vertuous, and to season all with sincerity or else it is counterfeit vertue and so double iniquity. And these
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:23186:192"/>
duties are to be performed not only to those that are of the <hi>house-hold of faith</hi> by reason of that mysticall vnion that is betwixt vs and them in Christ, but generally also vnto all men being made of the same moulds, and vnited into the brotherhood of the same bloud. So then <hi>Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> is vnto <hi>Wisdome</hi> as <hi>Hercules</hi> pillars beyond which it may not passe, and our Saviour alloweth men to be <hi>wise</hi> with <hi>Innocence</hi> and for <hi>Innocence</hi> but not against it.</p>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:23186:193"/>
Saints? Even heathen men acknowledge that <hi>Innocencie</hi> is to be held notwithstanding all outward evills. <hi>It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> saith <hi>Socrates, to suffer then to doe wrong. There are some things,</hi> saith <hi>Aristotle, to which a good man must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver suffer himselfe to be constrained, but rather endure all extremities, yea death it selfe.</hi> Wherevpon <hi>Socrates, I would rather dye a thousand times then forsake my station.</hi> And another, <hi>the veriest coward in the world am I to doe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill:</hi> and yet another, <hi>it is not the part of a vertuous man to say, this I will not suffer, but this I will not doe.</hi> And <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>britius</hi> obtained that honourable testimony of his enimy <hi>Pyrrhus, that the Sunne would sooner goe out of his course, then hee stray out of the way of honesty.</hi> So that by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony both of nature and grace, the law of <hi>innocencie</hi> is no <hi>Lesbian</hi> rule, flexible to all occasions: but according to the old saying <hi>Fiat justitia &amp; ruant caeli,</hi> justice must be done though vpon doing the same heaven and earth come together.</p>
                  <p>If this be so, will some men say, how then can wee be both <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>innocent</hi> at once? Very well, for as <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> saith, <hi>individuum justitiae &amp; prudentiae contuberni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> wisdome and innocence are inseparable compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

                        </gap>, it is impossible to bee good without wisdome.</hi> Secondly, neither can a man bee <hi>wise</hi> without <hi>innocence.</hi> For although there be a wisdome equivocally so called by reason of the resemblance it hath with the true wisdome, being able both to finde out
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:23186:193"/>
and to menage convenient meanes vnto worldly and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill ends: yet this Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the <hi>wisdome of the flesh,</hi> and Saint <hi>Iames, an earthly, sensuall, and divelish wisdome.</hi> But the true <hi>wisdome is from aboue,</hi> &amp; therefore <hi>pure, peaceable, easy to be intreated, full of mercy, and good fruits, without judging, and without hypocrisie,</hi> that is in one word innocent.

Now to bee wise without <hi>innocence</hi> is very hurtfull vnto publike states, for it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes the society of man, if one man may aduantage himselfe by the harme of another. For as in the fable of <hi>Menenius Agrippa</hi> the whole body soone perished when
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:23186:194"/>
the rest of the members to ease themselues wronged the belly: so the whole common-wealth will quickly be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued if men may be wise for themselues only and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto others. Neither is such wisdome hurtfull only to the publike, but also to a mans owne selfe. For sinne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the only evill that can hurt a man, hee hurts himselfe most who to decline a little evill of paine, or losse, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, commits an evill against his owne soule. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by first hee looseth the peace of his conscience, which is the happinesse of a man, yea his heauen vpon earth. For the iust man <hi>is as bold as a lyon,</hi> and a <hi>good conscience is a continuall feast,</hi> saith <hi>Salomon.</hi> Nay <hi>Epicurus</hi> himselfe who placeth the chiefest blessednesse of a man in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, confesseth that a man cannot liue comfortably vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les he liue innocently. For as oyle preserueth the light of the lampe, so doth innocence maintaine peace and ioy in the conscience. Againe, as by sinne the peace of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is lost, so it worketh confusion of face in the day of judgement, when men shall bee judged not by their worldly wisdome, but according to their <hi>innocence.</hi> Oh how many will there at that day cry out with <hi>Cicero, O me nunquam sapientem, &amp; aliquando id quod non eram falso existimatum,</hi> aye me that indeede was never wise, but falsely thought to be what I was not? And with those in the booke of <hi>Wisdome,</hi>

In bondage hee is free, in danger safe, in tribulation ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: the righteous loue him, the vnrighteous in their conscience cannot but approue him, and <hi>God</hi> himselfe highly esteemeth of him. Alas, alas that among men <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence</hi> should so little be regarded. Every man desireth to haue all other things good, a good house, good land, a good wife, good apparell, a good horse, every thing good: but a good and an innocent soule who desireth to haue? I cannot but wonder wherein man hath so highly offended his owne selfe, that he should thus wish all the things about him to be good, and himselfe only to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Perhaps thou wilt say, if I may be wise for my selfe no farther then <hi>innocence</hi> will giue me leaue, I shall bee a right <hi>innocent</hi> indeede, liuing but a poore life, and nothing set by of any.

For as for wicked men their honouring doth but avile and abase vs. And what talkest thou of a poore life? Is not <hi>innocencie</hi> it selfe great riches?

The holy Ghost in Scripture is resembled to a <hi>Doue</hi> &amp; appeared in the shape thereof, the divell is compared to a <hi>serpent</hi> and vsed it for his instrument. <hi>Illa à primordio divinae pacis praeco,</hi> the Doue in the beginning brought an Oliue branch in her mouth and preached peace vnto the world: <hi>ille à primor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio divinae imaginis praedo,</hi> the serpent in the beginning plaid the theefe and robbed mankinde of the image of God. The <hi>Serpent</hi> is accursed of God to creepe vpon his belly, and to licke the dust of the earth, all his portion is in this life: but the <hi>Doue</hi> hath wings giuen vnto her, euen the wings of innocence, <hi>couered with silver, and whose fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are like vnto the yellow gold,</hi> whereby as <hi>David</hi> saith <hi>she may fly away from hence and bee at rest.</hi> For when shee hath travelled over the world, &amp; by reason of the deluge of vanities wherewith it is ouerwhelmed can finde no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting place here below, then may shee betake her to her wings, and mount vp aloft into heauen, where our <hi>Nöe</hi> euen <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> our blessed Saviour and redeemer will be ready to stretch forth his hand and to receaue her into the arke of eternall glory and blessednesse.

I knowe mine owne insufficiencie, and you my Lords are as Angels of God. My purpose rather is to addresse my speech vnto those of inferiour place, and to aduise them vnto that which to mee seemes more necessary, <hi>Subiection</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi> More necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry I say for notwithstanding the negligence and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Magistrates, common wealths haue a long time subsisted and continued: but without <hi>Subjection</hi> and <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> they cannot.

to be ascribed vnto the ready and willing <hi>Obedience</hi> of the people. Howsoeuer, it is euident I am sure in experience that it is most necessary, and my Text in expresse tearmes avoucheth it, <hi>Yee must needs be subiect not only for Wrath, but also for Conscience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the better husbanding of the time, and that I bee not prevented thereby, I will not spend any part thereof in depending my Text vpon the former words of this Chapter, but will consider it as a perfect and entire sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in it selfe. Therein may it please you to obserue with me two parts, <hi>A dutie,</hi> &amp; <hi>the Necessitie</hi> of the same. The <hi>Dutie</hi> is <hi>Subiection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yee must be subiect.</hi> Which being a word of <hi>Relation,</hi> I must needs consider with it both the correlatiues, that is to say, 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. the <hi>Obiect</hi> or to whom <hi>Subjection</hi> is to be yeelded. 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. The <hi>Subiect,</hi> or by whom it is to be yeelded. 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. the <hi>Relation</hi> or <hi>Dutie</hi> it selfe, <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.</hi> As for the <hi>Necessity,</hi> it is expresly affirmed, <hi>Yee must needs be subiect</hi>: and that for two causes, first because of <hi>Wrath,</hi> secondly because of <hi>Conscience.</hi> And these are the limits within which I meane to bound my selfe at this time, not enlarging my speech in any part as easily I might, but only in regard of the weighty businesses suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>summa sequens fastigia rerum.</hi> First therefore of the <hi>Dutie,</hi> and therein also first of the <hi>Obiect</hi> to whom <hi>subiection</hi> is to be yeelded.</p>
                  <p>Who that is our Apostle plainely resolueth in the first verse of this Chapter, <hi>Let every soule bee subiect to the higher powers</hi>: as also in his Epistle to <hi>Titus, Put them in minde to be subiect to principalities and powers, and to obey Magistrates.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tit. 3.1.</note> yee must then be subiect to <hi>the higher pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> yee must be subiect to <hi>Magistrates.</hi> What <hi>Powers</hi>? What <hi>Magistrates</hi>? the <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> or <hi>Civill,</hi> or both?
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:23186:199"/>
Surely vnto the <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> Magistrate <hi>subiection</hi> is due, for as S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.17.</note> 
                     <hi>the Elders that rule well are worthie of double honour, specially they that labour in the word and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi> And againe,<note place="margin">Heb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3.17.</note> 
                     <hi>Obey them that haue rule over you, and submit your selues for they watch for your soules.</hi> Howbeit in this place not he,<note place="margin">V. 4.</note> but the <hi>Civill</hi> magistrate onely is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood: for he only <hi>beareth the sword,</hi> forcing to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>executeth vengeance on him that doth evill,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But what <hi>Civill Magistrate</hi>? For he is either <hi>supreme,</hi> or <hi>subordinate.</hi> The <hi>supreame</hi> (to say nothing of other states and polities) in <hi>a Monarchie</hi> is the <hi>King,</hi> in whom the <hi>Maiestie</hi> and soueraigne authority primarily and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally resides, euen as the light is radically in the sunne: being, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaketh, <hi>Homo solo Deo minor,</hi> onely inferiour vnto God, <hi>à Deo secundus, post eum primus, ante omnes, &amp; super omnes,</hi> second vnto God, after him the first, before all and aboue all, independant vpon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, subiect to the controle of no superiour power. <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Magistrates</hi> are they who deriue their authoritie from the soueraigne, as starres doe their light from the sun. For it being too heauy a burden for one man by him selfe alone to gouerne so great a multitude: soueraignes haue beene forced to devolue some part of their charge vpon others, and to honour them with some part of their authority for the discharge thereof:<note place="margin">Exod. 18.13. &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>Moses</hi> the soueraign iudge of the <hi>Israelites</hi> sitting alone from morning to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to iudge the people. <hi>Iethro</hi> his father in law told him
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:23186:200"/>
plainely, <hi>the thing thou doest is not well,</hi> advising him to authorize vnder him certaine men that were of courage, feared God, loued true dealing and hated couetousnesse, to be rulers ouer the people. This counsell <hi>Moses</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and <hi>God</hi> approued, and vpon the same ground in all nations ever hath beene practized. Now then if question be demanded, to whether <hi>Magistrate, Subiection</hi> is to bee yeelded, the <hi>Soveraigne</hi> or the <hi>Subordinate</hi>? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, to both.<note place="margin">Ver. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Let every soule,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Paul, be subiect to the higher powers</hi>: he speaketh indefinitely without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of any. But Saint <hi>Peter</hi> expresly speaketh of both and for both,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.13.14.</note> 
                     <hi>Submit your selues to every ordinance of man for the Lords sake, whither to the King as supreame, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to governors as vnto them that are sent by him.</hi> Yet here is it to be obserued, that although <hi>Subiection</hi> bee due to both, yet not alike to both: but to the <hi>Soveraigne</hi> first &amp; in the highest degree, because the fulnesse of power ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally rests in him, and vnto the <hi>Subordinate</hi> next and in inferiour degree, because they haue it but in part and at the second hand. And these againe because they are not all stars of the same magnitude, but one <hi>differeth from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in glory,</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> hath appointed some to bee ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of thousands, some of hundreds, some of fifties, some of tens: to every one subiection is due, not in the same measure, but according to their seuerall places, and the power which they haue receiued. And so much for the <hi>Obiect.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Subiect</hi> by whom <hi>Subiection</hi> is to bee yeelded, is whosoeuer relatiuely is opposed to the <hi>Higher Powers.</hi> Now to the <hi>Supreme</hi> and highest power every man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception is opposed, even <hi>Subordinate</hi> Magistrates themselues. For as in <hi>Logicke</hi> that <hi>Genus</hi> which they call

                     <hi>Subalterne,</hi> though it be a <hi>Genus</hi> in respect of those <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> that are vnder it, yet in regard of the <hi>Genus</hi> aboue it is but a <hi>Species</hi>: even so <hi>Subordinate</hi> Magistrates what place soeuer they hold in relation to their inferiour, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the <hi>Soveraigne</hi> or <hi>King</hi> they are but meere <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> and owe <hi>subiection</hi> as far forth as any other. And as when the sun appeareth all other starres are eclipsed and loose their light, &amp; riuers when they fall into the sea for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe their names: so in the presence of the <hi>Prince</hi> all infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior power and authority is swallowed vp and vanisheth into nothing.

                  <p>First then there is in the superior powers an eminencie aboue others in regard of their persons, as being the vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent and lieutenants of the King of heauen and earth, &amp; not as other men, but after a peculiar manner in maiestie and dominion bearing the image of God; <hi>the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> as <hi>Daniel</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Dan. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>hauing giuen vnto them a Kingdome, power, strength, and glory.</hi> In which respect they are stiled in Scripture <hi>Principalities and Powers, Dominations and Dignities, the Lords annointed, yea Gods, Dixi, Dij estis, I haue said yee are Gods.</hi> This eminency and excellency in the Magistrate is to be answered with <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> from vs.<note place="margin">Prov. 24.21.</note> 
                     <hi>My sonne, feare the Lord and the King,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon.</hi>

Honour thy Father and thy Mother,</hi> saith the fift commandement; not those naturall parents onely which haue begotten vs, but <hi>Patres patriae,</hi> the fathers of the country also. This <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Reverence</hi> (as I vnderstand) includeth within it a triple act, first of the <hi>minde</hi> in a due estimation and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:23186:201"/>
of their place and dignity, secondly of the <hi>will</hi> in an humble inclination thereof vnto them because of their excellency, thirdly of the body in outward behaviour &amp; carriage towards them, as rising vp in their presence, baring the head, bowing the knee, reverent speaking vnto them, and such like, according to the manner of the country where wee liue. Neverthelesse of these three the second is the principall and most proper act of Honour: for a man may know the worth of a thing, and yet bee no whit affected towards it,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> as the <hi>Gentiles knew God, yet glorified him not as God:</hi> and outward demeanure &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porement what shew of <hi>reverence</hi> soever it haue, yet may proceede of scorne and derision, as was that of the <hi>Iewes</hi> towards <hi>Christ.</hi> But if vpon apprehension of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates worth and excellency, the heart be inclined and duly affected therewith, all externall acts of reverence will surely follow of themselues. Such a one will ever set the best construction on all their actions, interpreting nothing sinisterly, he will conceale their errours and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and with <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Iaphet</hi> going backward co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, hee will not suffer them either in their persons or actions to bee traduced or dishonoured, but will care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully defend or excuse them. In a word, hee will not so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as entertaine an evill thought against them, so farre is he from saying or doing ought that may detract from them.

                  </p>
                  <p>The second eminencie in the magistrate is the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority:</hi> whereby he enacteth and ordaineth lawes for the well government of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, commanding that which is good, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that which is evill, advanceing the well deseruing,

                  <p>
                     <hi>Wrath</hi> is a passion seated in the <hi>Invading</hi> part of the soule of man, whereby hee desireth to keepe off, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue whatsoeuer is nociue &amp; hurtfull vnto him, &amp; that by way of invading and assaulting him who either would doe, or hath done vs hurt. For as man naturally desireth to preserue and keepe that good whereof hee is possessed, and to obtaine that farther good, which he seeth to bee convenient for him: so if any goe about to bereaue him of the one or to barre him from the other, presently the bloud begins to boyle about the heart, and anger so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames him, that he cannot let him alone, but must needs resist him and set against him with all his might. Hence is it that the philosopher calls anger <hi>cotem fortitudinis,</hi> the whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>stone of courage, and divers define it to be <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitum vindictae,</hi> desire of revenge. How truly and phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophically I despute not, sure I am <hi>revenge</hi> vsual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waites vpon wrath, and our <hi>Apostle</hi> ioynes them both together,<note place="margin">Ver. 4.</note>

the common suffer no detriment or harme. If therefore any shall hinder the publike good, or shall worke any disadvantage or dammage vnto the state, the <hi>wrath</hi> of the Magistrate ought to burne against such a man. And as God when his lawes are broken, or himselfe any way dishonoured waxeth angry with man: so these <hi>Gods</hi> on earth, these <hi>vicegods,</hi> when men by contemning their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and denying them due subiection goe about to disturbe and set combustion in the state, haue iust cause to be angry and to seeke revenge vpon them.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Wrath</hi> and desire of <hi>revenge</hi> in him that wanteth power is vaine and foolish according to that of the Poet <hi>Quid stulti proprium?</hi>

them committed, and into his hand is the sword of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice put, not to let it ly rusting in the sheath, but to draw it forth against offendors, and that first for the satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of iustice that the party delinquent may receiue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne punishment, and then for the example of others, <hi>that Israell may see and feare.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But what need, will some man say, so much to feare the <hi>Wrath</hi> of the Magistrate? May not a man hide his counsells so deepe, and carry his actions so cunningly that nor witnesse nor Iudge shall know them? If they come to light and bee discouered, doth not greatnesse breake through lawes as wasps doe through cobwebs? May not judges, jury, witnesses, by friends, fauour, bribes be corrupted? Are pardons impossible to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from Princes? Nay suppose the worst, that the penalty of the law can by no meanes be escaped, what care they for fines and amercements who are content to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:23186:205"/>
beggar themselues to enioy their pleasures? What for shame and ignominy, who are growne impudent in all wickednesse? What for death, who count it worse then death not to liue as they list, and to bee barred from their desires? For there haue beene who haue said <hi>moriar mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do regnet,</hi> let mee dye so he may be King, and, <hi>aut Caesar aut nihil,</hi> an Emperour or nothing. To all this I answere briefly, first trust not vnto secrecy, but remember what wise <hi>Solomon</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Eccl. 10.20.</note> 
                     <hi>Curse not the King no not in thy thought, neither the great one in thy bedchamber, for the foule of the Heaven will carry the voyce, and that which hath wings shall declare the matter.</hi> Secondly, hope not for impunity: many as great, as gratious, as wealthy as thou haue failed thereof: and how knowest thou but one time or other thou maist meete with one who will accept nor thy person, nor thy fee, but will say vnto thee with Saint <hi>Peter, thy mony perish with thee.</hi> Lastly, if any haue so farre put off naturall affection as not to feare <hi>Wrath,</hi> chusing rather to fall into the hands of justice then to be restrained from his wickednesse: let such a one know, that what <hi>Wrath</hi> cannot, yet <hi>Conscience</hi> should worke in him. For here it must freely bee confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that <hi>Wrath</hi> of it selfe is not sufficient: it striketh at the branches, not the roote, and endeavoureth to reforme outward actions, but reacheth not vnto the cause which is inward corruption. Which remaining in vs, <hi>Wrath</hi> happily may make vs more wary in offending, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not worke in vs a loue of goodnesse, and a desire not to offend at all. Wherefore <hi>God</hi> in his deepe wisdome hath thought it good to binde vs vnto <hi>subiection</hi> not by a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle but double tie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and vnto <hi>Wrath</hi> to adde <hi>Conscience, Yee must needs be subiect not only for wrath but also for conscience.</hi>

                     <hi>Conscience</hi> is that facultie or power of the Practicall vnderstanding in man, whereby he is priuy to all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whether they be immanent and conceaued within, as thoughts, or emanant and issuing forth, as his words and workes. This Conscience is then said to be bound, when by him who hath power and authority ouer it, it is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to performe its dutie, that is to beare witnesse of all our actions vnto God, and according to the qualitie of them to excuse or accuse vs: for that these are the duties of <hi>conscience</hi> plainely appeareth by that of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 2.15.</note> 
                     <hi>their conscience bearing witnesse, and their thoughts accusing or excusing.</hi> This charge is then laid vpon the Conscience, after that by the same authority man himselfe is bound: for man being free, Conscience also is free, but man being bound by a law, Conscience stands bound also. But who is the binder of the <hi>conscience?</hi> God without question. <hi>He is the Law-giuer,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iam. 4.12.</note> saith S. <hi>Iames, that can both saue and destroy:</hi> and he, as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>is greater then the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> But can the Magistrate also by his lawes binde the conscience? Papists attribute vnto vs the Negatiue, that they cannot: themselues hold the Affirmatiue, that they can, and warrant it by this my Text, <hi>Yee must bee subiect for conscience.</hi> Vpon this plaine song sundry of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scant very pleasantly, but none plaies the wanton more then <hi>Doctor Kellison,</hi> who inferres that we despoile Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of authority and superiority, and giue subjects good leaue to rebell and revolt, that we bring Iudges, and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall seats, and all lawes into contempt, that no Prince can rely on his subjects, no subjects on their Prince or fellow subjects, in a word, that wee take away all society and ciuill conversation. To all which I answere breefly. First suppose the maine ground were true, yet neither can
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:23186:206"/>
they proue it out of my Text, nor doe such absurdities follow therevpon. Out of my Text they cannot proue it, for that only affirmes that the <hi>Conscience</hi> is bound, but determines not that mans lawes bindeth it. Neither doe such absurdities follow, for alb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>it wee should deny man to be the binder, yet doe wee freely professe that the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> is bound, which is enough.</p>
                  <p>But we answer farther that they much abuse vs: for we deny not <hi>rem,</hi> that they binde, onely wee differ from them <hi>in modo,</hi> maintaining that they binde not in such manner as they teach. They hold that mens lawes binde <hi>non minùs guàm lex divina,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bellarm.</note> equally with Gods lawes, so that were there not any law of God binding to <hi>Subiection</hi> yet mans law of it selfe and of its owne power would binde. This we deny, teaching contrarily that humane lawes binde the <hi>Conscience</hi> not <hi>immediatly</hi> but <hi>mediatly,</hi> not <hi>primarily</hi> but <hi>secundarily,</hi> not <hi>in themselues &amp; of their owne power,</hi> but in the <hi>force and vertue of Divine law: Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine law,</hi> I say, whether that which is imprinted in the heart by nature, or that which is revealed vnto vs by Scripture, both which command <hi>Subiection.</hi> This truth in f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w words thus I demonstrate. First, if mans law imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly binde the <hi>Conscience,</hi> then is euery transgression thereof without farther respect vnto Gods law a mortall sinne. But so it is not, for according to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, sin is a transgression of the law, meaning not mans but Gods law only: in regard whereof S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Augustine</hi> saith more expresly, Sin is <hi>dictum, factum, concupitum,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny saying, doing, or coueting against Gods law. Besides if man of himselfe without respect vnto Gods law can binde the conscience, then either is he Lord of the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and may himselfe conuent it, examine it, take its te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:23186:206"/>
and accordingly proceed to sentence either of life or death both vpon body and soule: or he hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to command God to sit in judgement vpon the <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and to be the executioner of his lawes: or finally hee bindes the <hi>Conscience</hi> in vaine and to no purpose. To say that man is in such sort Lord of the <hi>Conscience</hi> is vnreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable because his knowledge and power reach no farther then the outward man. To say that man may command God, is sacrilegious, aduancing man aboue God. Lastly, to say that he bindeth in vaine and to no purpose, is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to say that their opinion is vaine, and that man hath no such power at all. To shut vp all in a word, vnlesse a man may with as much security obey man as God, man who is subject to error and injustice, as God who is free from both; vnlesse we be all as deeply bound to study the laws of men and to knowe them, as we are Gods, and to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject our selues as absolutely vnto them, it is altogether vnconceauable how humane lawes can bind the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence equally with diuine.</p>

God to institute the same was, partly his <hi>soueraigne Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> ouer man by right of creation, by which he may or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and dispose of him at pleasure, partly the great loue he beareth vnto humane society, which his infinite wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome saw could not so well be maintained, if euery man should be left to himselfe, and orderly gouernment were not setled among them.

                  <p>Now man being thus by the commandement and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God bound, Conscience cannot bee free: but as man shall either subject or not subject himselfe, so is Conscience bound to testifie for or against him, and to excuse or to accuse him.

on the contrary side yee shall for <hi>the Lords sake,</hi> and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to his ordinance yeeld subjectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er powers, and vnder them liue dutifully <hi>in all godlinesse and honestie:</hi> then shall your <hi>consciences</hi> testifie nothing but good of you, and excuse you vnto God, he shall justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and acquit you, your soule shall bee replenished with vnspeakable peace and comfort, so as yee shal haue a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven vpon earth, and in heauen it selfe in due time such ioyes <hi>as nor eye hath seene, nor eare heard, nor ever entred into the thought of man.</hi> To conclude and summe vp all, if either we will keepe a good <hi>conscience,</hi> that we may both here and ever be blessed, or will avoid the sting of an euill <hi>conscience,</hi> and the miseries that attend vpon it, wee must <hi>of necessity be subject. Yee must needs be subject not only for wrath, but also for conscience.</hi> And thus haue I finished the second part also, which is the <hi>Necesstie</hi> of the <hi>dutie.</hi> It on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remaineth now to adde a word or two by way of vse and application.</p>
                  <p>There is a generation of whom both S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Peter</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                     <hi>and speaketh evill of Dignities,</hi> cleane contrary vnto the doctrine of my Text, which commandeth all to <hi>be subject,</hi> and <hi>to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and obey</hi> the Magistrate. But these are not all of the same kinde: for some despise it out of an erronious judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, others out of an euill habit and custome. They that despise it vpon errour, are either <hi>Anabaptists</hi> or <hi>Papists.</hi> The <hi>Anabaptists</hi> a fanatical &amp; fantastical sect, vtterly mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like all gouernment and subjection among Christians. It is not without cause that S. <hi>Iude</hi> calleth such kind of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>Dreamers,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 8.</note> for so indeed they are, and their dreame is this, that <hi>Sin</hi> is the cause of <hi>Subjection</hi>: and although it were ordained and allowed to the Iewes because they
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:23186:208"/>
were but infants, yet fits it not vs Christians that are in the state of perfection. Shall I dispute against this dotage and shew that even among those blessed spirits that are free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sinne &amp; still persist in the truth there are <hi>Thrones, Dominations, Powers, Principalities, Angels, and Arch-an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels?</hi> That if man had continued in his integritie, yet go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment should haue beene<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inasmuch as man naturally is sociable and disciplinable, the morall law commands to <hi>honour father and mother,</hi> the end of gouernment is <hi>Peace</hi> with <hi>Pietie</hi> and <hi>Honestie,</hi> and one man euen then should haue stood in need of another? That finally there is now as great a necessity thereof as was among the <hi>Iews,</hi> and that the new Testament would neuer haue comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Subjection,</hi> or to pray for Magistrates if it were a sin for a Christian to be a Magistrate? But I will not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe them the honour to dispute with them: let it suffice in this honourable auditory barely to affirme, first that a Christian safely may be a Magistrate: secondly, that none is fitter then he, because no man better knowes the dutie of a Magistrate then he: Lastly that no man can so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly and perfectly performe the office of a Magistrate but hee, because no man vnderstands the true religion which he is to maintaine, and by which he is to gouerne, but he.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Papists,</hi> although they doe not thus reject all government, yet doe they many waies both in doctrine and practise avile and abase it. For first they giue vnto the <hi>Pope</hi> a <hi>supremacie</hi> ouer Princes, euen vnto <hi>Deposition,</hi> and depresse them so farre, as to hold the bason and ewer to him, to serue in the first dish at his table, to hold his stirrop, to lead his horse, yea to bee his horses too and to carry him on their shoulders. All this I marvell by what
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:23186:208"/>
right. <hi>Aaron</hi> aduanced not himselfe aboue <hi>Moses, Christ</hi> denied his <hi>kingdome to be of this world, Peter</hi> claimed no such power, ancient <hi>Popes</hi> acknowledged Kings and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours to be their good Lords and Masters. The first that vsurped it was a mushrom of the last night, that brand of hell <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> whom therefore <hi>Baronius</hi> makes the patterne of a perfect <hi>Pope,</hi> as <hi>Machiavel</hi> doth that monster <hi>Caesar Borgia</hi> of a perfect Prince. Secondly, as they subject all <hi>Monarchs</hi> to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> so he exempteth all <hi>Clerkes</hi> from their jurisdiction, <hi>etiam vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctos culinae,</hi> their cookes and skullions too, erecting to himselfe a Monarchie in euery state, possessing a third part in them, affirming that Kings may not punish his <hi>Clarkes</hi> because they are not their subjects, threatning the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with a thunderbolt from the <hi>Vatican</hi> if they shall presume so to doe. This also I maruell by what law. <hi>Divine?</hi> we haue demonstrated the contrary. <hi>Humane?</hi> Princes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not grant such priuileges as derogate from their soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty. But since the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is turned into a Court, no maruell if Christian liberty also bee changed into temporall franchises and immunities. Finally they teach that if a Prince become a tyrant, or be an hereticke, or excommunicate, it is lawfull then to arme against him, to set vpon him with dags, kniues, poisons, yea if need be to vndermine and blow vp whole Parliaments with gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouder: and if any of them for such practises be conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before the Magistrate, they may elude their exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations with <hi>equivocations and mentall reservations,</hi> as they tearme it in their canting language, but in true and plaine speech hellish lying and perjury. Certainely for these traiterous and more then heathenish doctrines, yee may be sure in scripture they haue neither precept nor
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:23186:209"/>
example: out of the Scripture the only presidents they can haue, are the ancient <hi>Pharisees</hi> whom <hi>Iosephus</hi> reporteth to haue beene great enimies vnto kings, and <hi>Mahumetan Assasins,</hi> whose profession it was to murther Christian Princes: and for cogging and cheating the <hi>Priscillian</hi> he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, whose rule was <hi>Iura, perjura, secretum prodere noli,</hi> sweare, forsweare, and bewray not in any case the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our sect and profession.</p>
                  <p>But besides <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> and <hi>Papists,</hi> there are others whose doctrines are sound and good, yet out of an evill habit and custome yeeld not vnto Magistrates their due honour. And are there not among vs too many of this kinde? What muttering, what whispering, what censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, what sinister construction set vpon euery action, what discouering, what blazing of infirmities, what so high but we will reach at, what so deep but wee will bee sounding the bottome of? Is this the honour, is this the obedience, is this the thankfulnes wherewith we requite our gouernours? You will say they are vnjust, tyrants, oppressors, bribers, <hi>God</hi> forbid: yet suppose it were so. What if parents wrong their children, and husbands bee froward to their wiues: shall children therefore disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour their parents, and wiues their husbands? As we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in faire weather, so must wee also patiently endure stormes and tempests when they come. Hard <hi>Rehoboam</hi> must haue subjection as well as <hi>David</hi>: and <hi>servants must be subject not only to good and courteous,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>but also to froward Masters.</hi> Happily our sins haue deserued such chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and then <hi>in wrath God</hi> sendeth evill Magistrates. A certaine holy man, they say, expostulated on a time, with God why he had permitted <hi>Phocas,</hi> being so cruell a man to bee Emperour: to whom a voice answered, that if a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:23186:209"/>
worse man could haue beene found he should haue beene set over them, the wickednesse of the world requiring it. In these cases the only weapons of Christians are <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces &amp; lachrymae,</hi> fasting and prayer: and whatsoeuer Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates be, st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>l wee must needs be subiect. Wee must be subiect for feare of <hi>wrath,</hi> for there is no mocking with princes. <hi>Durum est scribere contra cos qui possunt proscribere,</hi> it is dangerous to contest with them that can outlaw vs and turne vs out of all wee haue, and to jest with those that can <hi>gladio <gap reason="foreign">

No wee must bee subiect for <hi>Conscience,</hi> for the <hi>Lords sake.</hi> If the heathen man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing damned, what he had learned by the study of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, could answere to doe that willingly which others doe by compulsion: should not a Christian bee ashamed not to learne so much by Christian religion? The first lesson that Christian religion teacheth is humility: if this be once learned, <hi>Conscionable subiection</hi> will soone fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. For where pride raignes <hi>Omnes dominari, nemo ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vire vult,</hi> every one will be a King, none will be subiect: but <hi>Humility</hi> is a vertue that fits vs <hi>Obedience</hi> and to doe the commandements of others.</p>
                  <p>As for you, my Lords, to whom according to your place subiection is due, giue mee leaue to addresse my speech vnto you in the words of the Apostle to <hi>Titus, See that no man despise you.</hi> Neither let the speech seeme strange vnto you, for if you be despised, it proceeds most<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from your owne default, either you are not such men or such Magistrates as you should be. It is a great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:23186:210"/>
to looke for honour while your actions are disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, and to bee called and counted Lords being ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants vnto base lusts and affections. First then if you will haue others to be subiect vnto you, bee you subiect vnto <hi>God, kisse the sonne,</hi> honour and obey him and <hi>God</hi> will honour you. While man liued in subiection vnto <hi>God</hi> all the rest of the creatures stood in awe of him: but when once he rebelled against <hi>God</hi> by eating of the forbidden fruit, they rebelled against him also. In like manner will it be with you: if yee honour him, men shall honour you, if otherwise, he knoweth how to poure contempt vpon princes also. Next, it behooueth you to carry yourselues in your places as becometh you, that is, as Iudges not as marchants: not as marchants to buy and sell mens rights, but as just Iudges to giue vnto every man his right. And to this end it may please you to remember that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calleth you <hi>Gods,</hi> and therefore that yee should bee like vnto <hi>God,</hi> not <hi>accepting the persons</hi> of any, nor suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your selues to bee corrupted by any meanes, but in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing to giue righteous iudgement. Remember I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you also that <hi>God standeth in the congregation of Gods,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 82.1</note> and although in places of judicature an empty throne be not now set for him as it was among the <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opians,</hi> yet be assured that he is alwaies present with you, and will certainly iudge you as he sees you iudge others. Remember farther that they are men whose causes yee iudge, made of the same stuffe, bearing the same image of <hi>God,</hi> redeemed by the same pretious bloud of <hi>Christ,</hi> quickned by the same spirit, <hi>heires of the same Kingdome</hi> with you.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:23186:211"/>
to haue care that Magistracy be not despised. As wee are desirous to be assisted by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so let vs in our places assist them.

they be provided of some buckler against them, or threed to disintangle them. Thirdly &amp; lastly to reforme the affection, and to worke those that are contrary min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to a little more <hi>Charity</hi>: that seeing vpon how slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and sandy a ground they haue wronged the people of God in their <hi>Christian liberty,</hi> tying them farre shorter and straiter then God himselfe doth, they may be moued hereafter, not to censure their brethren with so much su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perciliousnesse, &amp; to hold a better correspondence with them.

True it is, debausht and lewd companions are not to bee humoured in their vanities: howbeit it is a very prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous course because of the abuse to condemne the lawfull vse, and to labour the redressing of a misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure in life, either by breeding or fomenting an errour in judgement.

                     <p>Here is much adoe to make M. <hi>Perkins</hi> contradict himselfe: but in vaine, and to little purpose. <hi>Dice</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, and some <hi>Games</hi> both at <hi>cards</hi> &amp; <hi>tables</hi> he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth to be <hi>meer Lots</hi>: but that all <hi>Games</hi> at <hi>cards</hi> and <hi>tables</hi> are so also in his judgement. I marvell much out of what words you can shew it. Is it because there is in them a <hi>casualtie</hi>? So in there is many things besides, which yet are not <hi>Lots.</hi> For as for that you say, it is <hi>casuall, or else it is couzning,</hi> it is idle, and shall bee answered in the next Section.

                     <p>It is <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>We,</hi> or <hi>Fortune</hi>?

What <hi>Fortune?</hi> Fie, that were hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish, and who dares say so? Verily no sound Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, if by <hi>Fortune</hi> you vnderstand that blinde Idol which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> worshipped as a Goddesse, and to whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant wheele they ascribed that which was due to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Providence.</hi> But if therby nothing be meant but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>chance</hi> or the <hi>casuall event</hi> of things: I see not why it should bee counted heathenish to say <hi>Fortune</hi> or <hi>chance</hi> hath a hand in the disposing of such things. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> indeed in his <hi>Retractions</hi> repenteth him that in other of his writings he had so often vsed the word <hi>Fortune</hi>:<note place="margin">Lib. 1. c. 1.</note> not that he denies the <hi>chanceablenesse</hi> of things, but because the word had beene so ordinarily abused. For otherwise he plainely affirmeth that no religion forbiddeth to say, <hi>Fortè, forsan, forsitan, fortuitò,</hi> that is, perhaps, perchance, peraduenture. Why should it, seeing the holy Ghost him selfe is not afraid to vse it?<note place="margin">Eccl. 9.11.</note>

the same root, and vsually opposed to <hi>Fore-cast and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</hi> For want whereof in man seeing there is vnto man a <hi>Fortune</hi> or <hi>chance</hi>: I hope it is not heathenish to say that in regard of vs, <hi>Fortune</hi> or <hi>chance</hi> hath a finger in some things. In regard of vs I say, for vnto God who foreseeth and ordereth all things, nothing can bee casuall.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Fortune,</hi> why not <hi>We</hi> much more? For in these <hi>mixt games</hi> betwixt the hazard and the victory, comes our skil and industrie directing the hazard vnto victory. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be true that God by his <hi>Providence</hi> disposeth therein, yet it is as true that man also by his counsell dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth vnder God. This notwithstanding you tell vs plainly, that <hi>to say it is we that dispose it is flat couzning if it be true, and will loose all credit with gamesters.</hi> I see you are a merry Gentleman, and would faine be reputed igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the course of these <hi>games.</hi> Otherwise you would not but knowe, that to cast the <hi>die</hi> or to shuffle the <hi>Cards</hi> is one thing, and to order them after they bee so cast or shufled is another.

                     <p>This booke of M. <hi>Yates</hi> neither haue I lying by mee, neither is it much materiall what hee holds in this point. For certainely if this bee his <hi>Definition</hi> it is a very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound one. For according to the rules of <hi>Logicke,</hi> every good <hi>Definition</hi> must be reciprocall with the <hi>Definite</hi>: as in this for example, <hi>Every man is a reasonable creature,</hi> &amp;, <hi>Every reasonable creature is a man.</hi> But in this it is not so: for although euery <hi>Lot</hi> may be such a <hi>Divine testimonie,</hi> yet euery such testimonie is not by and by a <hi>Lot.</hi> Were it so, then <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> and <hi>Prophecies,</hi> and <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> and <hi>Scripture,</hi> and such like should all bee <hi>Lots</hi>: for they are <hi>Divine testimonies,</hi> and giuen to resolue doubts.</p>
                     <p>Howbeit I grant that <hi>Lots</hi> are <hi>Divine testimonies,</hi> though not all after the same sort. To cleare which I thus
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:23186:217"/>
distinguish. <hi>Lots</hi> are either <hi>Ordinary,</hi> or <hi>Extraordinary. Extraordinary</hi> are those wherein God by his immediate and speciall <hi>Providence</hi> inevitably conducteth the <hi>Lot</hi> to that end wherevnto it was intended. <hi>Ordinarie</hi> are those wherein God by his generall influence and prouidence supporting the naturall abilities of the Creature, suffereth it to worke according to that power wherewith it is ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. Of these <hi>Lots,</hi> the former are testimonies of what God himselfe doth and approueth being done: the latter not so, but only of what he permitteth or suffereth to bee done. The reason, because in those God himselfe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily worketh vnto the end: but in these giueth the Creature leaue to worke at pleasure. This point being thus cleared, let vs see how you argue from hence.</p>

                        <hi>Such a thing is practised by gamesters. First it is a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine testimonie: for it is all one for God to speake from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and to dispose of it who shall haue these</hi> Cards <hi>or that</hi> Monie, <hi>as it is for him by his immediate hand of Providence to turne the</hi> Dice <hi>thus, or dispose the</hi> Cards <hi>so. For every one will confesse that this is his hand, as well as hee would confesse that that were his tongue. And what difference is there betweene the tongue speaking and the hand writing in regard of testimonie? Sauing that the hand is the more bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the more excellent, at least amongst men.</hi> Vox audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta perit, littera scripta manet.</p>

                     <speaker>DEFENCE.</speaker>
                     <p>Thus you argue, <hi>Where there is a divine testimonie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue doubts there is a meere Lottery: But in Cards &amp; Dice there is a divine testimonie to resolue a doubt, namely who
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:23186:217"/>
shall haue these cards or that mony: Ergo in Cards and Dice there is a meere Lottery.</hi> The <hi>Maior</hi> or former <hi>Proposition</hi> of this <hi>Syllogisme</hi> is not true: for as is shewed in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>section,</hi> every <hi>Divine testimony</hi> resoluing a doubt is not by and by a <hi>lot,</hi> much lesse a <hi>meere lot.</hi> Witnesse your own example of Gods immediat speaking from Heauen, which yet I presume you will not say is a <hi>lot.</hi> I denie it therefore putting you to proue it: which as here you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour not to doe, leauing it naked to the mercy of the world, so you will not in hast effect.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> or second <hi>Proposition</hi> I grant: for as in all <hi>Ordinary lots,</hi> so in <hi>Cards</hi> and <hi>Dice,</hi> when the <hi>Chance</hi> hath disposed, it is a plaine testimony that God so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Neither needed you to spend words in proofe of that which is not denied, or you should haue brought stronger proofe. For whereas you reason thus, <hi>God by his immediate hand of Providence turnes the</hi> Dice <hi>thus &amp; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth the Cards so: Ergo it is a Divine testimony:</hi> though the <hi>consequence</hi> be good, yet the <hi>Antecedent</hi> is manifestly false. For although in <hi>Extraordinary lots</hi> God worke by his immediate and speciall <hi>Providence</hi>: yet in <hi>Ordinary lots,</hi> and consequently in <hi>Cards</hi> &amp; <hi>Dice</hi> it is not so, God in them not restraining the power of the creature, but giuing it leaue to worke at liberty. And verily if in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>lot</hi> there were, as here you seeme to hold, an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate hand of <hi>Providence,</hi> then is it in mans power to set God a working and that immediatly when hee listeth, which is absurd to imagine. Then also may all trialls of right, of fact, of fitnesse to an office, and what not, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to a <hi>lot,</hi> as which cannot erre, if Gods immediate hand which cannot doe vniustly direct it. Whereas not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding nothing is more vncertaine then a <hi>lot,</hi> and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:23186:218"/>
wise men refuse to commit matters of such consequence vnto the hazard thereof.</p>
                     <p>As for that you adde, <hi>What difference betweene the toungue speaking and the hand writing in regard of testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, saving that hand-writing is the better and more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi>? I con you hearty thankes for it. For if <hi>Divine te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony</hi> be the ground and reason of Faith, and the word written be <hi>Divine testimony</hi> as well, nay better, as you say, and more excellent then the word spoken by mouth: it followeth that the word written may beget <hi>Faith</hi> and convert a soule as well as the word by mouth preached. Whether you would willingly be of this opinion or no I cannot say: sure I am you must of force, if you will hold to your owne <hi>Premisses.</hi> This by the way.</p>

Iosh. 14. To knowe who was in fault <hi>that</hi> Israel <hi>fell before their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> Ios. 17. <hi>to knowe whether</hi> Ioses <hi>or</hi> Mathias <hi>were to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed</hi> Iudas.

                     <speaker>DEFENCE.</speaker>
                     <p>Vnto this assertion I oppose the contrary, affirming that <hi>it is lawfull to vse Lots in gaming or light matters:</hi> nay farther that <hi>the most serious businesses are lest fit for lots, &amp; the lightest most fit.</hi> For what thing is there in the world more vncertaine then a meer <hi>Chance</hi>? What that lesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth right or wrong, true or false, good or bad, fit or vnfit? What matter soeuer be to be decided, the <hi>Lot</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to either side, and cares not which way it fall. And hence it is that by <hi>lot</hi> neither doth the <hi>Church</hi> trye the fitnesse of her <hi>Ministers,</hi> nor the <hi>Lawyer</hi> the right of his <hi>Clients</hi> cause, nor the <hi>Physitian</hi> the state of his <hi>patient.</hi> Neither is it the manner of wise men to referre any thing vnto a <hi>lot,</hi> vntill by their wisdome and providence they haue so disposed of all things as it is not much materiall which way the <hi>lot</hi> fall. Were the question referred to a <hi>lot</hi> of any great consequence, of great consequence also must the fall of the <hi>lot</hi> be, and if it fall amisse great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences must needs ensue thereof. But if wise men so order and cast their businesses as it is indifferent vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> howsoeuer the <hi>lot</hi> fall, that cannot bee of any great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:23186:222"/>
which they referre vnto a <hi>lot.</hi> But I forget that I stand rather in the place of an <hi>Answerer</hi> then <hi>Replier,</hi> and therefore I come directly to your Arguments.</p>
                     <p>Your <hi>Argument</hi> standeth thus. <hi>That which the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God never vsed but in vrgent great and weightie matters is not to bee vsed in gaming or light matters: But the Seruants of God neuer vsed</hi> Lots <hi>but in vrgent great &amp; weighty matters</hi>: Ergo Lots <hi>are not to be vsed in gaming or light matters.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> it seemes you take for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: for you goe not about to proue it. The <hi>Minor</hi> you endeauour to confirme by certaine examples out of holy writ, which we will by and by examine. In the meane season I answer by distinguishing of that tearme, <hi>the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God.</hi> For by it you may vnderstand either all those holy men of God who haue beene since the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on downe vnto this present instant, or onely those few <hi>Saints</hi> of God whom the Scripture maketh mention of. If you take it in the former sense, the <hi>Assumption</hi> is manifestly false, <hi>that none of the Servants of God vsed lots in gaming at any time, but only in weightie matters.</hi> For I thinke there is no man so vncharitable as to say that all those who haue or doe sometime play at <hi>Cards</hi> &amp; <hi>Tables</hi> are vnregenerate and no seruants of God. If you take it in the latter sense, then is the <hi>Major</hi> false, <hi>that what those few mentioned in scripture never did, we may not doe.</hi> For as their actions without a precept binde vs not to imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: so their omissions without a prohibition lay not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs an obligation of forbearance. If they did, then might we not play at Chesse, or the <hi>Philosophers game,</hi> or bowles, or the like, because those <hi>Servants</hi> of God for ought we knowe neuer vsed any of them. But let vs see how you proue that Gods Seruants neuer vsed <hi>lots</hi> but in serious matters.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:23186:222"/>Thus you proue it, <hi>They vsed lots in serious matters,</hi> Ergo, <hi>they vsed them only in serious matters.</hi> A sillie <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,</hi> and neere a kin to that protrite <hi>Enthymeme, The sunne shines in heauen,</hi> Ergo, <hi>the staffe stands in the bench corner.</hi> But to satisfie the reader more fully I answere three things. First, where to proue your <hi>Antecedent</hi> you affirme among other things, that <hi>Priests</hi> were chosen by <hi>lot,</hi> you are fouly mistaken. For <hi>Aaron</hi> and his posterity without intervention of a <hi>lot</hi> by the immediate voice of God, were perpetually appointed to the <hi>Priesthood.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, these <hi>lots</hi> here mentioned were all of them <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi>: whence if your reason be good it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that none but <hi>Extraordinary lots</hi> may be vsed, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that now adaies no <hi>lots</hi> at all may be vsed, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that God hauing not promised the like <hi>Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> assistance, it would be but tempting of God to expect an <hi>Extraordinary</hi> working from him in a <hi>lot.</hi> Thirdly &amp; lastly it followeth not, <hi>Wee read not in scripture that the Saints vsed lots in light matters,</hi> Ergo, <hi>they vsed them only in weightie.</hi> For it is a meere Fallacie, to dispute from <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority negatiuely</hi> in a case of <hi>Fact.</hi> In a question of <hi>Faith</hi> the sequele is good, <hi>We read it not in scripture,</hi> Ergo, <hi>it is not a matter of Faith</hi>: the reason, because <hi>scripture</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth all matters of <hi>Faith.</hi> But in questions of <hi>Fact</hi> it is not so, because it was not the purpose of the holy Ghost to register downe in the <hi>Scripture</hi> all whatsoeuer his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants had done, much lesse their sports and recreations. Had it beene his purpose so to doe, hee would neuer haue said so often in the booke of <hi>Kings, The rest of the acts of such or such a King, are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kings of Iudah</hi>?

                        <hi>But it may be obiected, some matters of small moment haue beene determined by</hi> Lots, <hi>as for example who should be dore keepers of the</hi> Temple of Ierusalem. <hi>I answere that was no light matter.

Many a man if it should be tried had rather haue that office then twenty pounds by the yeare, and that is a matter if it were of much lesse weight in which we may lawfully vse a</hi> Lot. <hi>Now much more might the</hi> dore-keepers of Gods house <hi>be warranted from reason (suppose they had no speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all command) to cast</hi> Lots, <hi>or to haue</hi> Lots <hi>cast vpon them to determine who should supply that worthy office.</hi>

                     <p>As a pound compared to a scruple is weightie, but light compared to a talent: so the <hi>Porters</hi> office in regard of the <hi>Nethinims</hi> hewers of wood and drawers of water, might be of some reckning, but very meane in respect of the <hi>Priesthood.</hi> So that a man may safely say the <hi>Porters</hi> office was but a low place, and the <hi>lots</hi> were vsed in no very high matter. But whether high or low it is not greatly materiall, seeing the sinewes of your <hi>Argument</hi> are cut already. Yet let vs heare what you say. <hi>First, it was Gods command, and his command is neuer light.</hi> True,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:23186:223"/>
yet this letteth not but God may giue command touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing light things: as he did when he tooke order for <hi>every petty and small matter</hi> that the hearing and determining of them should bee referred vnto the inferiour officers.<note place="margin">Exod. 18.26.</note> And if his <hi>Providence</hi> reach euen to the smallest matters, what impeachment can it be to his honour to giue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment touching them also? The <hi>Pins</hi> of the <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,</hi> and the beesoms of the Temple were no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, yet God disdained not to giue order for them. And as in a building, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. <hi>the great stones can never bee well laid without the lesse:</hi> so also in the gouernment of the world for the better ordering of the greatest things, God takes care of the smallest also.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, say you, <hi>David so honoured the Office that he had rather be a dore-keeper in the house of</hi> God <hi>then to dwel in the tents of wickednesse.</hi> But what if <hi>David</hi> in that place spake not of <hi>Dore-keepers</hi>? What then is become of your argument? The words in the <hi>Original</hi> are <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>I could wish rather to threshold it. Iunius</hi> translates it <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men frequent are,</hi> often to passe ouer the threshold of Gods house and to be conversant in the <hi>Church</hi>: which may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto any other of the people of God aswell as the Porters. But be it that he meane them, inasmuch as the Psalme is inscribed to the <hi>Korhites</hi> who were <hi>Dore-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi> yet doth it not argue such dignitie in the office. If a man should say, I had rather be a <hi>Sexten</hi> or <hi>Dog-whipper</hi> in the poorest parish in <hi>England,</hi> then the great <hi>Caliph</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> would any therevpon say hee spake reverendly of a <hi>Sextens</hi> or <hi>Dog-whippers</hi> place? Nay verily, but that he doth the more abase the <hi>Caliphat</hi> or <hi>Popedome.</hi> Even so <hi>Dauid</hi> preferring a Porters place
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:23186:224"/>
vnto the tents of wickednesse, doth not so much intend to honour that as to avile these. And hence is it that the <hi>Septuagint</hi> renders it by <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Lastly, say you, <hi>it is something to bee the King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands Porter, for the place may be worth better then twenty pounds by the yeare: much more to bee a Porter in</hi> Gods <hi>house.</hi> Well then now I see that twenty pounds by the yeare is something: and I neuer thought till now that a Portership yearely worth so much had been such a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull preferment. But is it weightie enough for a <hi>lot</hi>? Yea marry is it, and so is a <hi>matter of much lesse weight too.</hi> If so, then <hi>games</hi> and <hi>recreations</hi> are not vnfit for it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for there are many Gentlemen of good fashion who value their play in a farre greater summe then that comes vnto. Howbeit I must doe you to wit, that <hi>it was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by lots who should be Porters,</hi> as you say, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly who should attend at what gate, Eastward, Westward, Northward, or Southward, which could bee no great matter.</p>

                     <p>A doughtie Argument. <hi>That whereof there is no neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity may not be vsed: But there is no necessity of</hi> Lots <hi>in light matters:</hi> Ergo, <hi>in light matters</hi> Lots <hi>may not be vsed.</hi> The <hi>Minor</hi> which you knew no man would deny you proue, because such <hi>matters may otherwise be determined</hi>: but the <hi>Maior</hi> which is palpably false you proue not at all, and I marvell with what forhead a man of vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding can affirme it. What? Nothing to be done but that is necessary? What then shall become of things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent? May not they be vsed neither? For necessary I am sure they are not. Why then doe you eat flesh? For you may be otherwise fed. Why weare you linnen, seeing you may bee otherwise clothed? And why play you at Chesse, at the <hi>Philosophers game,</hi> at Bowles, seeing you haue <hi>Ouranomachie, Metromachie,</hi> &amp; the long Bow where with to recreate you?</p>
                     <p>Yea but it is <hi>Presumption to trouble the King with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vaine businesse.</hi> What of that? Forsooth it is more so to trouble the King of Kings. But how doe wee trouble him? By solliciting his <hi>Providence.</hi> What <hi>Providence</hi>? That which is <hi>Immediate and Extraordinary</hi>? Indeed so to doe would be too presumptious. But wee doe not so, for we consult not with God, nor looke we for any <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi> worke from him. Our businesse is not such as needs so speciall a presence and assistance of God: a <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual event</hi> is sufficient to determine it. Wee inquire not what it is that God would haue to be done or not to bee done: that without speciall command or instinct were <hi>Sorcerie</hi> or <hi>Divination</hi> by <hi>Lots.</hi> But wee doe that which God vnder himselfe hath enabled vs to doe, expecting
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:23186:225"/>
no issue from him saue only by <hi>Ordinary</hi> meanes: which as in other our actions so in this I hope we may doe with out troubling the king, as you imagine. In a word, the maine errour is, you fancie in all <hi>lots</hi> an <hi>immediate</hi> &amp; <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary providence,</hi> which is euer denied, and neither is nor even can be proued by you.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly there is no warrant from Gods word to meddle with</hi> Lots <hi>in sleight matters, neither from expresse comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d nor from any approued example, nor from any reasonable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <p>This <hi>argument</hi> is thus to be formed. <hi>That which is not warranted from Gods word may not be medled withall: Lots in sleight matters are not so warranted</hi>: Ergo, <hi>Lots in sleight matters are not to be medled withall.</hi> The <hi>Maior</hi> you confirme by that of S. <hi>Paul, Whatsoeuer is not of faith is sinne</hi>: The <hi>Minor,</hi> for that it is not warranted, nor by <hi>expresse command,</hi> nor <hi>approued example,</hi> nor <hi>reasonable consequence.</hi> To all which I answer, and first to the <hi>maior,</hi> by denying it, and withall affirming that S. <hi>Pauls</hi> words proue it not. For by <hi>Faith</hi> he meanes nothing but <hi>Plero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorie,</hi> or certaine assurednesse that what we goe about is lawfull to be done. Now this <hi>Assurance</hi> in many things may be gotten not only by the supernaturall light of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation contained in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> but also by the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall light of reason imprinted in our hearts. For the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral law</hi> is naturall vnto vs, and was by the finger of God
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:23186:225"/>
written in our minds, before it was grauen in tables of stone. And the rule of this law is a sufficient warrant of our actions, as for example, of honouring our parents, and doing the workes of iustice by giuing vnto every one his due, although wee never knew the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther need wee to seeke any farther proofe hereof then from our owne <hi>Consciences,</hi> which naturally checke and controle vs, whensoever wee swarue and decline from it, and also cleare vs when wee yeeld obedience therevnto.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> also I deny, for <hi>lots</hi> in sleight matters, and consequently in <hi>Gaming</hi> are warranted not only by the law of <hi>Nature,</hi> but also by <hi>Scripture.</hi> How so, will you say? By <hi>expresse commandement?</hi> Not so, for then they should be necessary: and if nothing should bee lawfull but that which is so commanded, neither should any thing be <hi>indifferent</hi> and left vnto vs free and arbitrary. By any <hi>approved example</hi> then? Nor so, for the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were not written to record the <hi>games</hi> and <hi>playes</hi> of men, but to a more serious end. How then? By iust <hi>consequence,</hi> thus. That which in <hi>Scripture</hi> is neither commanded nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden is indifferent, and consequently lawfull. But <hi>lots</hi> in light matters as namely in <hi>games</hi> are neither comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nor forbidden. <hi>Ergo</hi> they are indifferent and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently lawfull.</p>

                     <speaker>N. N.</speaker>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>wee haue no example that ever any</hi> good man <hi>vsed the</hi> Lot <hi>about any thing in which it was not lawfull to pray</hi> God <hi>to direct and dispose of it. Now no man will say or thinke that it is lawfull or convenient to pray to</hi> God <hi>so or so to direct or dispose of the</hi> Cards <hi>or</hi> Dice <hi>that such a man may haue such a</hi> Card, <hi>or such a one</hi> throw <hi>such a cast at</hi>

Dice, <hi>it being a matter at the best hand but of</hi> Recreation. <hi>For albeit there be</hi> warrant <hi>to recreate our selues, yet wee haue neither</hi> command <hi>nor</hi> warrant <hi>to pray</hi> God <hi>to direct vs in the determination of any thing about our</hi> Recreations <hi>by</hi> Lot.</p>

                     <p>Your fourth <hi>Argument</hi> standeth thus, <hi>That lot wherein it is not lawfull nor convenient to pray</hi> God <hi>to direct it is vnlawfull: but in light matters, as</hi> Cards <hi>and</hi> Dice <hi>it is vnlawfull and inconvenient to pray</hi> God <hi>to direct the</hi> Lot: <hi>Ergo a lot in such matters is vnlawfull.</hi> The <hi>Maior</hi> you proue because we read not of any good man that vsed the <hi>lot</hi> in any thing wherein hee might not pray for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection <hi>of it</hi>: the <hi>Minor,</hi> because at the best hand <hi>Games</hi> are but matters of <hi>Recreation.</hi> I answere, and first to the <hi>Maior</hi> negatiuely. For although in <hi>Extraordinary lots</hi> wherein there is an expectation of Gods <hi>immediat provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> for direction, it is fit by prayer to craue the same of God: yet in those <hi>Ordinary lots</hi> wherein it is not materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all which way they fall, and no notable inconvenience can ensue thereof, it is not necessary so to doe. The confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation which you bring for your <hi>Maior,</hi> is <hi>authority ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiuely</hi> in point of <hi>Fact,</hi> which is a meere <hi>Sophisticall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lench,</hi> &amp; of no validity. Wherein also you take for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that which cannot bee yeelded without much folly, nor demanded without much impudence, namely that whatsoever the Saints did, is recorded in <hi>Scripture,</hi> which wee haue shewed to be farre otherwise.</p>
                     <p>Vnto the <hi>Minor,</hi> and the proofe thereof I say no more but this, that as all other our actions, so our <hi>Gaming</hi> also is sanctified vnto vs by <hi>Prayer.</hi> Not that at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:23186:226"/>
of every act a man is bound to put himselfe on his knees, and to make his particular addresses vnto God: for the morning sacrifice through the acceptation of God is sufficient to that end, and stretcheth it sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e to all the daies actions. Although I deny not, but as at our meales, so also in the beginning and closing vp of our play, wee may with short eiaculations both craue a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing vpon our recreation, and praise him for the same. But as touching the fall of the <hi>lot</hi> in our <hi>games,</hi> because it is like hearb <hi>Iohn</hi> in a pot of broth doing neither good nor harme, I hold it as inconvenient to pray for it as it is to pray for good successe at a match of bowles. For as for those who adventure at play more then they can well spare without disabling themselues, they passe beyond their bounds, and offend against the rule of moderation in play. Yet if such a one finding his rashnesse, and sincerely resoluing not to commit such an errour againe, shall in his heart entreat God to free him from the present dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, I thinke such prayer should not be vnlawfull to him.</p>

                     <p>Fiftly, <hi>a</hi> Lot <hi>is a thing that belongs to the</hi> art of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>and can be</hi> defined <hi>no where but there, nor handled by any other way.

                     <p>Your <hi>Assumption</hi> therefore I deny, <hi>That a Lot belongs to the art of Divinity and is there to be defined &amp; handled.</hi> If you aske a reason of the deniall, you may know I am not bound to render it: your place is not to aske questions, but to proue what you affirme. Neverthelesse the reason is this, because the termes of the <hi>definition</hi> belong not vnto <hi>Divinity.</hi> Not the <hi>Genus</hi> which is a <hi>Chance</hi> or <hi>Casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all event,</hi> for that belongs vnto the <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> as also doth <hi>Necessity.</hi> Not the <hi>Forme,</hi> which is the <hi>applying of the chance to resolue a doubt,</hi> for that belongs vnto <hi>Pollicie</hi> or <hi>Morality.</hi> If you foist any other thing into the <hi>Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,</hi> whatsoever it be it is superfluous and impertinent. But why should any man thinke that it pertaines to a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> to define a <hi>lot</hi>? Is it because there is in them a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence?</hi> So is there also in Chesse, &amp; Bowles and all other things whether serious or lusory: yet are they not therefore <hi>Theologicall.</hi> Is it because there is in them an immediat providence? So indeede you dreame, but wee haue already clearly demonstrated the contrary. Is it then because they haue beene vsed in holy and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous businesses? So is bread, and wine, and water also v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: yet I hope you will not say that the <hi>Definition</hi> of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:23186:228"/>
these things is proper to <hi>Divinity,</hi> or that wee may not play with them, and vse them in light matters.

                     <p>The forme of your Argument is this, <hi>That which equals an Oth in any thing and excels it in many things may not be vsed in light matters: A lot equals an Oth in any thing and excels it in many things</hi>: Ergo, <hi>a lot may not be vsed in light matters.</hi> The <hi>Maior</hi> I readily yeeld vnto: but the <hi>Minor,</hi> pardon me if I speake plaine <hi>English</hi> &amp; call a spade a spade, is little lesse then blasphemie. For in an Oth there is a solemne appeale made vnto God, both by attestation of his <hi>Omniscience,</hi> and obligation of our selues vnto the severest censure of his justice if we should sweare falsely. But in <hi>Ordinary lots</hi> no such appeale is made vnto him, but only to a <hi>Casuall event</hi> meerely considered as it is <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall</hi>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:23186:230"/>
an <hi>Ordinance,</hi> I cannot but wonder how you durst so to compare them. But let vs heare your reasons, and first wherein they are equall.</p>
                     <p>An Oth, you say, <hi>is of Gods ordaining, and so is a lot.</hi> Nay so is not a <hi>lot.</hi> God indeed permitteth it, alloweth it, and if you will, adviseth it too: but commandeth it not, as he doth an Oth. All the power now it hath is only from humane institution and agreement. Againe, an Oth, say you, <hi>is a meanes to decide controversies, so is a lot.</hi> True, but not such a <hi>meanes,</hi> nor of such <hi>Controversies.</hi> Not such a <hi>meanes,</hi> for an Oth is ordained by God to this very end: but a Lot howsoeuer it may be vsed to the same end, yet is it so by mans <hi>Ordinance</hi> not Gods. And an Oth strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bindeth to pronounce rightly: whereas a Lot is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, as being but a <hi>Casualtie.</hi> Nor of such <hi>controversies,</hi> for an Oth determines questions of right &amp; fact, which a Lot cannot: and they that are wise neuer referre matters of so high a nature to so incompetent a iudge. Thirdly, say you, <hi>an oth taken settles contentment among men, so it is or should be in a lot, for God doth it.</hi> It doth, but an Oth by vertue of that obligation wherein man stands bound vnto God to speake nothing but truth: and a Lot only by reason of some compact formerly made between men. Neither doth God doe it as you say, but without restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the naturall power of the Creature suffereth him to worke and doe as him listeth. Fourthly, <hi>an oth,</hi> you say, <hi>cals God to witnesse, so doth a lot.</hi> Nay so doth not a Lot: for he that casteth the Lot, respecteth not <hi>Providence</hi> but <hi>Casualtie,</hi> and to expect Gods immediate hand therein is no better then tempting of him. But what if the Lot fall amisse, as it may doe, shall God be a false witnesse? God forbid. Yet so it must needs be if in every Lot God bee
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:23186:231"/>
called to witnesse. Lastly, say you, <hi>an Oth must be in truth, righteousnesse, and iudgement, so it is in the Lot being dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by him that is thus qualified.</hi> As touching an Oath I grant, but how it may be done in a Lot, I for my part vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not. For a Lot is but a Chance, and Chance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth nor <hi>truth</hi> nor <hi>righteousnesse</hi> nor <hi>iudgement.</hi> But he that <hi>disposeth the lot should bee thus qualified.</hi> Who is that? God? The word <hi>qualified</hi> fits not him that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but substance: and to God nothing is casuall, and so no Lot. Man? That were to contradict your owne selfe: for you haue confidently affirmed againe and againe that God alone disposeth in a Lot, and man hath no hand therein. <hi>Sed magna est veritas &amp; praevalet,</hi> errour hath but a bad memory, &amp; truth at one time or other will sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breake forth. <hi>Many other waies there are,</hi> you say, <hi>wherein a lot equals an Oth</hi>: but what they are neither doe you tell vs, neither will I trouble my selfe to enquire. I come therefore to examine wherein a Lot excels an Oth</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Now it excels an</hi> Oth <hi>in these and other particulars. A</hi> Lot <hi>decides that which an</hi> Oth <hi>cannot. Its vnlawfull to vse. a</hi> Lot <hi>if witnesse or</hi> Oth <hi>can decide it. It was an order in</hi> Israel <hi>that if the vnder-officers could not decide a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, they should bring it to the chiefe Iudge or high Priest to be determined. So fares it in this, which argues the hand of it. When all meanes vsed by vs by</hi> prayer, inquirie, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse <hi>and</hi> oth, <hi>are not able to decide a controversie,</hi> bring it to me, <hi>saith God,</hi> the Lot shall doe it, hee will doe it by a Lot.</p>

                     <p>Indeed there are some causes, wherein by reason of their indifference either way, an Oth is not fit to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. For example, when things are as equally parted as mans wisdome can devise, and the question is who shall haue which part, what can Oth or testimonie doe in this case? Nothing at all. But a Lot can, you will say. True, yet this advanceth not a Lot aboue an Oth, but rather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baseth it. For Oths may not bee taken but in weightie matters; and this is so small that an idiot or child may as easily determine it as a Lot. In matters of importance, such as concerne right and fact, deposition of witnesses is of great force. What a Lot? Of none at all. For example, a murther is committed, <hi>Titius</hi> is arraigned for it, <hi>Sejus</hi> &amp; <hi>Sempronius</hi> testifie vpon their Oth that <hi>Titius</hi> is the man: it sufficeth to convict him. Now suppose witnesses fayle and cannot be produced: what can a Lot doe? Can it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly find out the guilty person? If no, as indeed it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, how is it that you say, bring it to a Lot, and that shall decide it?</p>
                     <p>For, if I mistake not your comparison, you make <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, enquirie, witnesse, oth,</hi> and <hi>other meanes</hi> to be as the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der officers in <hi>Israel</hi>: but a Lot as the <hi>chiefe judge,</hi> or <hi>High Priest,</hi> to whom was referred what else could not bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, and from whom there might be no appeale. But good sir, you knowe that comparisons proue not, &amp; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that a Lot is Gods highest tribunall, or that his <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Providence</hi> worketh therein. Were it so, I demand why questions of right and fact may not bee tryed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by? For I presume no man knowes what is to bee done better then God, and hee is not partiall to accept the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:23186:232"/>
of any. If you say they may, then I demand farther, whether the Lot will alwaies fall out right? If yea, then would the fall of the Lot be vnalterable although it were cast a thousand times. But experience telleth vs that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry severall cast varieth and altereth the <hi>Chance:</hi> and how then can we excuse God from mutabilitie and inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie? If no, then must God pronounce an vnrighteous sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and how then shall the judge of the whole world passe vnblameable, or not stained in his honour with foule vnjustice? To avoid all which inconveniences I would advise you to put on <hi>Christian ingenuity,</hi> &amp; to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge your errour herein, that God may bee justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all his sayings, and cleare when he is judged.</p>

In a word, I allow the right vse, and condemne the abuse, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through too much strictnesse barring Gods people from the one, nor through too much remissenesse giuing way vnto the other. And so I conclude with that prudent saying of the wise <hi>Preacher, Eccles.</hi> 7.

                        <hi>the Body of Christ which before was only in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is now also vnder the Accidents of Bread.</hi> So that more fitly it might haue beene tearmed <hi>Cession</hi> or <hi>Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> or <hi>Substitution,</hi> or <hi>Translocation,</hi> or some such like ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then <hi>Transubstantiation</hi>: the meaning you giue vnto it being no other then a <hi>succeeding of Christs Body</hi> into the roome of <hi>Bread</hi> vpon the abolishing of the <hi>Substance</hi> thereof.

                        <hi>For proofe of this</hi> ground, <hi>Saint</hi> Augustine <hi>handleth this matter in a</hi> speciall <hi>booke to his friend</hi> Honoratus <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by the</hi> Manichees, <hi>as himselfe also sometimes had bin, and he entituleth his booke</hi> De vtilitate credendi. <hi>His dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is this.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cap. 7.</note> Suppose that wee now first of all did seeke vnto what Religion we should commit our soules to bee purged and rectified: Without all doubt wee must begin with the Catholike Church, for that shee is the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent now in the world, there being more Christians in her this day, then in any other Church of Iewes &amp; Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles put together. And albeit among these Christians there be Sects and Heresies, and all of them would seeme to be Catholikes, and doe call others besides themselues Hereticks: yet all grant that if wee consider the whole Body of the World, there is one Church among them more eminent then all other, and more plentifull in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and as they which know her doe affirme, more sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere also in the truth. But as concerning truth wee shall dispute more afterward: now it is sufficient for them that desire to learne, that there is a Catholike Church, which is one in it selfe, wherevnto diverse Heretickes doe faine and devise divers names, whereas they and their Sects are called by peculiar names, which themselues cannot deny. Whereby all men that are indifferent and not letted by passion may vnderstand vnto what Church the name Catholike which all parts desire and pretend is to bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <hi>Thus</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:23186:244"/>
to haue beene better warranted, then by the single autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of one <hi>Father</hi>: who how eminent soever hee was in his time, yet is not his sole word of strength enough to beare vp such a weight. Why did you not vouch the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> or Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> or some other of the holy penmen of <hi>Gods</hi> booke which cannot deceiue you; then Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> or any other of the antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who both haue erred themselues and may mislead you. But thus it is with Papists, the more the shame, the bare name of a <hi>Father</hi> swayes them more, then the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest passage of holy writ. Howbeit this I say not as if we feared the triall of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> for be it known vnto you, wee haue more cause to bee confident vpon them then your selues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but only to vindicate the honour and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which of your side are too basely sleighted and neglected. And as touching this particular place of Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> notwithstanding all the flourish you make therewith, yet shall you never be able to proue what you intend thereby, as I come now to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.</p>
                     <p>This booke <hi>de vtilitate credendi,</hi> I haue now twice for your sake throughly read ouer, and with the best attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I could. In it I find the <hi>authority</hi> of the <hi>Catholik Church</hi> made the <hi>first motiue</hi> or <hi>meanes</hi> vnto <hi>Faith,</hi> by which we doe beleeue: but not the <hi>first principle</hi> and <hi>reason of faith,</hi> for which wee doe beleeue. The occasion of writing it was this.<note place="margin">Cap. 1.</note> Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> hauing lately through Gods grace,<note place="margin">Con. ep. fund l. 10.</note> escaped out of the toiles of the <hi>Manichean Heretiks,</hi> in which for the space of nine yeares hee had beene en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled: is very desirous to recouer from them his friend <hi>Honoratus</hi> also, as yet continuing in his error, and held fast by them. This he doubteth not, through the same
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:23186:244"/>
grace of <hi>God,</hi> soone to effect, may hee but find him duly prepared and disposed. For vntill hee be wrought from his hereticall pertinacy and stifnesse, vnto a more <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> moderation and equability: he shall with all his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments but wash a bricke, as they say, and spend his oile and labour to little purpose. That which made him so vntoward and hard to be wrought vpon was, the faire and plausible insinuation of the <hi>Manichees,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cap 1.</note> that they pressed no man to beleeue vntill they had first cleared and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested the truth: whereas others terrified men with super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, and commanded <hi>Faith</hi> before they tendred any <hi>reason</hi> vnto them. Wherefore to remoue this preiudice, and to frame him vnto a more indifferent temper, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth in this booke all his strength and skill: labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to demonstrate the <hi>Vtility of beleeuing,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ibid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> and how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite it is to yeeld to <hi>authority,</hi> before with pure minds we can discerne the truth. And this is the only drift and scope he aimeth at in this booke, neither medleth hee therein with any of the <hi>Manichean heresies,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cap. 5. Retract. l. 1. c. 14.</note> but reserueth the confutation &amp; conviction of them vntill some other time, as appeareth by the very closing vp thereof: where he willeth <hi>Honoratus</hi> to remember,<note place="margin">Cap. vlt.</note> 
                        <hi>that he hath not yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne to refute the Manichees, nor to se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> himselfe against those toies, nor hath opened any great matter touching Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Doctrine.</hi> Whence thus I argue. If S. <hi>Augustin</hi> in this booke dispute against <hi>Honoratus</hi> from the <hi>Churches authority</hi> as the last <hi>resolution of Faith:</hi> then hath he ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therein the <hi>greatest point of Christian religion,</hi> and confuted thereby the <hi>Manichean heresie,</hi> inasmuch as the <hi>Catholike Church</hi> vtterly condemned it. But S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> in expresse words affirmeth, <hi>that he hath not so much as begun to refute the Manichees, nor opened any great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:23186:245"/>
touching Catholike doctrine.</hi> Therefore he disputeth not from the <hi>Churches authority,</hi> as the <hi>last resolution of Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>True it is he is much in commending <hi>authority,</hi> &amp; setting forth the benefit of <hi>beleeving</hi> it. But what <hi>authority?</hi> What beleeuing that <hi>authority</hi> which is grounded vpon the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall opinion,</hi>

                     <p>Out of that passage of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Augustine</hi> you obserue two things, first what be the <hi>Marks</hi> by which the <hi>Catholike Church</hi> may be discerned: secondly that shee may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued securely, as one that can neither deceiue nor he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. As touching the former, you say Saint <hi>Augustines Markes</hi> are these foure, <hi>Eminence, Vniversality, Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> and <hi>Possession</hi> of the name <hi>Catholike.</hi> Wherevnto I answere, first that Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> maketh none of these things <hi>Notes of the Church.</hi> For three of them, namely <hi>Eminencie, Vniversality</hi> and <hi>Possession</hi> of the name <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi> he doth not at all mention. <hi>Eminencie</hi> I confesse is foisted into your translation, but no where appeares in the Originall. Of the fourth, to wit <hi>Multitude,</hi> all that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:23186:246"/>
he affirmeth is this, that in his time there were more <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> then of any other religion: and that among all <hi>Sects</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi> there was one <hi>Church</hi> consisting of a greater number then all the rest: which is not enough to establish it for a marke of the <hi>Church.</hi> Where, by the way giue me leaue to demand, why whereas Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith <hi>Christians are more then Iewes and worshippers of Images put together,</hi> you render it, the <hi>Iewes and Gentiles put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>? For what the reason should bee I cannot conceiue, vnlesse it be the same for which you raze out of your <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techismes</hi> the second <hi>Commandement.</hi> But I answere se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Augustine</hi> maketh none of them <hi>Marks,</hi> so neither are they <hi>Markes</hi>: for <hi>Proper</hi> they are not nor <hi>Perpetuall,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> may be without them. So was it for some while after Christs Ascention: for then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the Christian Church so <hi>Eminent</hi> as that of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> nor was it <hi>Vniversall</hi> as being confined within <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> nor <hi>great in number</hi> as consisting but of a very few, nor in <hi>Possession</hi> of the <hi>name Catholike,</hi> it being a word of a latter date, and such as could not well be giuen it vntill it was growne Catholike. So will it be also, if wee may beleeue your owne writers,<note place="margin">Aquin. in Apoc. 9. Rhem. in 2. Thes. 2. Peter in Dan. l. 15.</note> in the time of <hi>Antichrist.

                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:23186:246"/>As touching the <hi>second</hi> point, that the <hi>Church may be beleeved securely, for that shee can neither deceiue nor bee deceiued</hi>: I demand what you meane by the Church? If the company of all true Beleeuers that now are, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore haue beene, including the holy <hi>Apostles</hi> together with them: then I grant it. For these were so lead by the <hi>Spirit</hi> into all <hi>truth</hi> that they could not possibly erre in any matter of <hi>Faith</hi> that was either to be taught by them or knowne by vs. But if you meane the <hi>Present Church in</hi> every age successiuely after the <hi>Apostles,</hi> as here Saint <hi>Austin</hi> doth, referring his friend <hi>Honoratus</hi> therevnto: then I distinguish. Either you must vnderstand thereby the whole number of true beleeuers who for the present life in the world: or the <hi>Society</hi> and <hi>Fellowship</hi> of those that in their time rule and sway most in the <hi>Church.</hi> If you take it in the former sense, I grant what you say to be true in <hi>Fundamentall</hi> points, but not in such as are not absolutely necessary, nor preiudice the <hi>Foundation of Faith.</hi> If in the latter, then I affirme that the <hi>Church</hi> may both <hi>deceiue</hi> and be <hi>deceiued,</hi> even in <hi>Doctrines</hi> of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>consequence,</hi> neither can with such security bee belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Witnesse the time when the whole world groaned vnder <hi>Arianisme,</hi> and the greatest part of the <hi>Prelates,</hi> together with <hi>Liberius Bishop of Rome</hi> subscribed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto. Neither doth the passage you alledge out of Saint <hi>Austin</hi> inferre the contrary. For although the surest course <hi>to put an end to all labours and turmoiles be, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the way of Catholike discipline, which hath flowne downe to vs from Christ by his Apostles:</hi> yet the <hi>Authority</hi> that swayeth most in the <hi>Present Church</hi> doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies either follow this way her selfe, or direct others vnto it, as for example it did not in the time aboue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned

For of our Sacraments, which you say is the thing signified by theirs, benefit they never reaped any, as neuer being partakers of them: and to leaue vnto them no more but bare signes, that is emptie shels without the kernell, how it might availe them I cannot conceaue.

I say secondly, that the Fathers calling the Sacraments of the old Law Figures of ours, meane not that they were bare and naked signes without the truth, but that in them the thing signified was more darkly and implicitly shadowed then in ours.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:23186:248"/>

For neither the one nor the other ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expresly or implicitly make it a Figure of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but of Christ himselfe and his Flesh. For as for the sixt of <hi>Iohn,</hi> it is cleare that our Saviour speaketh not therein of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> or of <hi>Sacramentall Manducation</hi>: but only of the Spirituall eating of his Flesh by Faith.<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.35.</note> I, saith he, <hi>am the Bread of life: hee that commeth vnto mee shall not hunger, and hee that beleeueth in me shall neuer thirst.</hi> Where although to continue the Allegorie, hee might haue said, <hi>He that eateth me shall not hunger, and he that drinketh me shall not thirst</hi>: yet hee chose rather to vse the words of <hi>Comming</hi> and <hi>Beleeuing,</hi> to teach vs that hee speaketh not of an <hi>Oral</hi> eating and drinking by the Mouth, but only of a Spirituall by Faith.

                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:23186:250"/>Yet before I proceed to the Consequence, some of your <hi>By-speeches</hi> are also to be examined. First you say that <hi>Bread aud Wine was mysteriously offered to Almighty God by Melchizedeck.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Session. 3. can. 2.</note> But both the Original and your Vulgar translation,, made authenticall by the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> say that he <hi>brought forth Bread and Wine,</hi> and not to God, as an <hi>Oblation,</hi> but to <hi>Abraham</hi> for his refection. If he had offered vp <hi>Bread</hi> &amp; <hi>Wine</hi> as a Sacrifice to God, how commeth it to passe that the Apostle comparing the <hi>Priesthood</hi> of Christ and <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> so particularly,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.</note> maketh no mention at all thereof? For certainly the point being so materiall, and the place so fit, it must needs bee great ignorance or negligence to omit it. To say nothing that if your owne reason be good, the Sacrifice of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedeck</hi> shall be inferiour to that of <hi>Aaron</hi>: Bread and Wine being of lesse value, and not so evidently represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the death of Christ as the slaying of Beasts doth. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly you say, that <hi>the true Flesh of Christ is contained in this Sacrament, and that the ancient Fathers with one consent testifie the same:</hi> which in your sense and meaning is vtterly false. For neither is the Flesh of Christ vnder the Accidents of <hi>Bread</hi> by <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> neither doth any of the ancient Fathers testifie it, as in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quele (God willing) shall more plainely appeare. Thirdly, where you say, <hi>and many others as my Author setteth downe,</hi> it seemeth that in this point you beleeue but by an Attornie, pinning your Faith vnto the credit of I knowe not whom. <hi>The true flesh of Christ,</hi> say you, <hi>is contained in the Sacrament.</hi> How knowe you that? By the ioint con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of Fathers. And how know you they consent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? My Author tells me so.

I trow no, but some equivocating <hi>Priest</hi> or <hi>Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite.</hi> A sure rock I promise you to stay your faith vpon. You say lastly, that <hi>the Bloud of the Testament described,</hi> Exod. 24. &amp; Heb. 9. <hi>was fulfilled when Christ said, This cup is the new Testament in my Bloud.</hi> False. For then hee did but institute the Sacrament of his death: and fulfilled it the day following, when really hee suffered death vpon the <hi>Crosse.</hi> And what reason haue you to thinke it was performed in a <hi>Commemoratiue sacrifice,</hi> wherein your selues confesse there is no effusion of Bloud: rather then in the <hi>true Sacrifice</hi> vpon the <hi>Crosse,</hi> wherein the pretious bloud of the sonne of God was plentifully shed?</p>

What inferre you therevpon? The <hi>Real Presence</hi> and <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> How so I pray you?

The Cloud, the Red sea, and Circumcision,</hi> were all as you say <hi>Figures</hi> of <hi>Baptisme</hi>: and the <hi>Figure</hi> is euer inferiour to the thing <hi>Figured.</hi> If therefore <hi>Baptisme</hi> be only <hi>Water,</hi> and suffer no <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> at all, the <hi>Figure</hi> is equall or more excellent then the thing <hi>Figured.</hi> For the <hi>Water</hi> of the <hi>Cloud,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Red sea</hi> was equall to the <hi>Water</hi> of <hi>Baptisme:</hi> and the <hi>Foreskin</hi> in <hi>Circumcision</hi> is much better as being part of the <hi>Flesh</hi> of man. What say you now? Doth this <hi>Argument</hi> follow yea or no? If yea, then haue wee a <hi>Real Presence</hi> also in <hi>Baptisme</hi> by <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> of <hi>Water,</hi> which I suppose you will not admit. If no, then neither doth it follow in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> for the reason is exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the same in both.</p>
                     <p>Would you yet more plainely see your errour? It is this, your <hi>Disiunction</hi> is not sufficient: either there is a <hi>Real Presence,</hi> or the <hi>Iewish Figures</hi> equall our <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> For there are diuers other waies wherein our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments</hi> excell theirs although there be no such <hi>Presence</hi> at all. What waies will you say? Verily not in the worth or value of the outward <hi>Elements,</hi> for therein they may be exceeded: nor in the thing <hi>signified,</hi> for it is one &amp; the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:23186:251"/>
same in both, even <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi> Wherein then? Even in these particulars. First their Sacraments respected Christ yet to be exhibited in the flesh: our Christ alredy exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Now as the Faith of things future is ever more lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid and faint then of things past: so is the adumbration and shadowing of them vnto Faith more obscure also.

                     <p>Here least wee should escape your hands by some one <hi>Evasion</hi> or other: you endeavor very diligently to block vp the passage against vs. For whereas your <hi>Argument</hi> was, that <hi>vnlesse Christ be really present in the Sacrament, the Iewish Figures are as good as our truth</hi>: you bring vs in answering thereto, that our <hi>Bread</hi> is not <hi>Common Bread</hi> but such as being eaten by <hi>Faith</hi> worketh the <hi>Effect</hi> of <hi>Christs Body,</hi> and bringeth <hi>Grace.</hi> Indeed we say that our <hi>Sacramentall Bread</hi> is not <hi>Common Bread</hi>: and we farther confesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that whosoeuer receaueth the same worthily, eateth withall the <hi>Body</hi> of Christ and receaueth <hi>Grace.</hi> But we neuer say it in answer to your <hi>Objectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> neither ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we with any reason. For wee are not ignorant that the <hi>signes</hi> also in the old Sacraments were not Common or Profane things, but sanctified and set apart to holy vses: and that being receaued by <hi>Faith,</hi> they were thereby partakers of Christ and all his benefits as well as we. The right answer wee giue is, by denying the consequence: our Sacraments, as wee haue shewed, many waies excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling those of the old Testament, though there be no <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation</hi> at all. So that this is not an <hi>Evasion,</hi> as you say of ours, but rather a fiction and device of yours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the end you may seeme to prevaile in something, being not able to gainesay the true <hi>Answer.</hi>

and conferre <hi>Grace</hi> by the very <hi>work done,</hi> without any respect to the <hi>merit</hi> or <hi>Faith</hi> of the receauer, which the old <hi>Sacraments</hi> did not.

                        <hi>Hieroms</hi> words inferre it not.

                     <p>First, what if I should except against this <hi>Cyril</hi> as an vnsufficient witnesse? For perhaps he deserueth it, and so doing I shall not at all wrong him.

but withall that he wrote them in his youth, and long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was Bishop, which much elevateth the weight of his testimonie.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:23186:259"/>
                        <hi>Cyrils</hi> owne words are, <hi>in the Type</hi> or <hi>Figure of Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine.</hi> And this wee acknowledge to bee most true. For in the receauing of the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> which <hi>typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> are the <hi>body</hi> and <hi>bloud</hi> of Christ, wee truly and really after a spirituall manner receaue his very <hi>body</hi> and <hi>bloud</hi> also. In regard whereof as he calleth <hi>bread</hi> &amp; <hi>winetypes</hi>: so he maketh the <hi>body</hi> &amp; <hi>bloud</hi> of Christ their <hi>Anti-types. They are commanded,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cat. myst. 5.</note> saith he, <hi>to tast, not of bread and wine, but of the Anti-type, the body and bloud of Christ.</hi> The <hi>body</hi> therefore and the <hi>bloud</hi> is in the <hi>bread</hi> and in the <hi>wine,</hi> as the <hi>Anti-type</hi> is the <hi>type,</hi> or the thing figured in the figure: which I hope may be done without any <hi>Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Certainely if wheresoeuer you read of <hi>Formes, shewes,</hi> or <hi>shapes,</hi> you by and by conceaue of nothing but <hi>Accidents</hi> without <hi>substance</hi>: it cannot be avoided but you must needs fall into dangerous errours. When Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.9.7.8.</note> that <hi>Christ being in the forme of God counted it no ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine to be equall with God: Neverthelesse emptied himselfe taking the forme of a servant, made after the similitude of men, and being found in figure as a man humbled himselfe, &amp;c.</hi> What will you conclude hence, that Christ is onely <hi>shew</hi> without <hi>substance,</hi> and neither true God nor true Man?

                     <p>As for the testimonie of S. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> I answere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it breefly. <hi>We must not beleeue our senses,</hi> saith he. True, for they discerne nothing else but bare <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> and are not capable of the <hi>mystery</hi> signified and exhibited by them. To apprehend that belongeth vnto <hi>Faith,</hi> and not <hi>sense.</hi> Yet is not <hi>sense</hi> every way to bee discredited: for we beleeue it is <hi>Whitenesse</hi> which we see, and <hi>sauour</hi>
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:23186:259"/>
which we tast, yea we may safely beleeue it is <hi>bread</hi> which we take and eat. Wherein then may we not beleeue <hi>sense</hi>? That it is meere <hi>bread.</hi> For it perceaueth not that it is <hi>sanctified</hi> and <hi>sacramentall bread.</hi> But of this more hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Againe, <hi>We must,</hi> saith he, <hi>simply and without all ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity beleeue the words of Christ, saying, This is my body.</hi> Questionlesse we must: and hee that beleeueth them not is an infidell. But seeing, as your selues confesse, <hi>bread</hi> in proper signification is not the body of Christ: neither was it Christs meaning we should beleeue it to be so. To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue Christs words then is to beleeue them in Christs meaning: which because it is not literall, as we haue said, it must needs be <hi>Figuratiue,</hi> thus, <hi>This bread sacramentally is my body.</hi> But of this also more hereafter. Lastly, saith he, <hi>He giueth himselfe not only to bee seene, but also to bee touched, handled, and eaten.</hi> This is sufficiently answered already: whether to avoid <hi>tautologie</hi> I referre my selfe.

Their reasons are, first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>stile</hi> much differeth from that of <hi>Ambrose</hi>; his being <hi>cleare,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Sixt. Sen. bibl. l. 4:</note>

Lastly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause repeating the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> hee deliuereth the sixt <hi>Petition</hi> in these words, <hi>And suffer vs not to bee led into temptation</hi>;<note place="margin">Lib. 6. c. 5.</note> whereas the words of Christ are, <hi>And lead vs not into temptation,</hi> which it is not to bee thought that S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> either was ignorant of, or meant to amend.

                     <p>But if you will, let them bee Saint <hi>Ambroses</hi>: For I meane not to be peremptory herein. What would you

All he saith is, that after <hi>consecration bread is made flesh, and wine bloud:</hi> out of which it followeth not that it ceaseth to be <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine:</hi> for S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe affirmeth that this notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding they still remaine what they were.<note place="margin">De Sacram. l 4 c 4</note> 
                        <hi>If,</hi> saith he, <hi>there bee so great power in the word of the Lord Iesus, that they should beginne to bee that which they were not: how much more effectuall is it, that they be what they were, &amp; yet be changed into another thing.</hi> But how may this be will you say, that it should remaine <hi>bread</hi> and yet be made <hi>flesh?</hi> Let S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> resolue you. <hi>The grace of God,</hi> saith he, <hi>sanctifying the bread, it is freed from the name of bread, and counted worthy of the name of the Lords body.</hi> Yea and S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> himselfe also. <hi>The Lord Iesus himselfe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">De myst. init. c. 9.</note> saith he, <hi>cryeth, this is my body. Before the blessing of the heauenly words, it is named ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde</hi>: after consecration the body of Christ is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. He saith, his Bloud.

                     <p>Saint <hi>Cyril</hi> saith, <hi>that wee are conioyned vnto Christ corporally by communication of his flesh</hi>: and againe that in the <hi>Sacrament wee corporally and substantially receiue the Sonne of God.</hi> Wherevnto I answere that Saint <hi>Cyril</hi> disputeth against a certaine <hi>Heretike</hi> who held that wee are one with Christ by Faith in his Deity, and not by coniuction with his <hi>Flesh:</hi> and to this purpose wrested that saying of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> wherein he calleth himselfe a <hi>Vine,</hi>

vnto him not only by that <hi>Faith</hi> whereby wee beleeue him to be the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and that Charity whereby wee loue him and spiritually embrace him, but also in our <hi>Flesh</hi> to his very <hi>Flesh</hi>: and that therefore Christ not only in regard of <hi>Deity</hi> is the <hi>Vine</hi> and wee his <hi>Branches,</hi> but also in respect of his <hi>Body. May it not,</hi> saith hee, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently be said, that his humanity is the vine and wee the Branches by reason of the identity of nature?</hi> And to proue this he drawes his argument from this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> for that by it not only the gifts and graces of his <hi>Deity,</hi> but also his true reall <hi>Body</hi> is after an inscrutable and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable manner communicated vnto vs. True it is he vseth the word <hi>corporally</hi>: but he saith also <hi>by the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the same flesh.</hi> Whereby he insinuateth that hee intendeth not by that word to expresse the <hi>Manner</hi> how we are vnited, but the <hi>Thing</hi> wherevnto wee are vnited after a <hi>Bodily manner,</hi> but vnto the <hi>Body.</hi> Else this absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity will follow that wee by the <hi>Sacrament</hi> are after a <hi>Bodily manner in Christ</hi> as well as <hi>Christ</hi> is in vs: for Saint <hi>Cyril</hi> affirmeth both, that wee are <hi>corporally</hi> in <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Christ corporally</hi> in vs. Whereas therefore <hi>Cyril</hi> saith, <hi>not only by Faith and charity, but also corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,</hi> he doth not exclude the one but admitteth both: as appeareth by that he saith <hi>both spiritually and corporally are wee the Branches and Christ the Vine.</hi> And the plaine meaning is, that not only in regard of the <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>Deity</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and our <hi>faith</hi> &amp; <hi>charity,</hi> but also in respect of his very <hi>Flesh</hi> are wee truly ioyned vnto him.

But what <hi>ioyning</hi> doe they meane? The taking of <hi>Christs flesh</hi> into the mouth. They neuer dreamt of it. And if it were so, it would follow that all they that <hi>eat Christ Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally</hi> (among whom how many <hi>Reprobates</hi> are there?) shall rise againe vnto life everlasting. For I hope you will not say that the sacred <hi>Flesh</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> doth quicken any vnto everlasting death. How then is it? By <hi>eating him</hi> not only <hi>Sacramentally,</hi> but also <hi>spiritually</hi> and by <hi>Faith.</hi> For by this meanes Christ becomes the food of our soules, which redounding vpon the <hi>Flesh</hi> by making it the Temple of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and an instrument of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes, fitteth and prepareth it to a glorious <hi>Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>

                     <p>Where little or nothing is objected the answer is soone made. <hi>Optatus</hi> saith, that <hi>the altar is the seat of Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud, and that the chalice beareth his bloud. Irenaeus</hi> saith, that <hi>after consecration the Eucharist of the body and bloud is made,</hi> that in it there is a <hi>heavenly thing,</hi> and the <hi>Apostles had authority to make present the body of Christ.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:23186:270"/>
Ergo</hi> the body and bloud of Christ is really, corporally, locally, and by way of <hi>Transubstantiation present</hi> in the Sacrament, A poore and silly consequence, which all the wity our author hath, wil neuer be able to make good. For those words of the <hi>Fathers</hi> may be salued and verified if Christ be <hi>Present</hi> any other way. And <hi>Present</hi> hee is <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally</hi> to the <hi>signes,</hi> and <hi>spiritually</hi> to the <hi>Faith</hi> of the worthy receauer. Neither are the <hi>Fathers</hi> alwaies <hi>literally</hi> to be vnderstood, when they vse the names of the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Bloud</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> For it is the common practise of them all writing of the Sacraments, specially of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> to call the <hi>signe</hi> by the name of the thing <hi>signified</hi>: following therein the custome of Scripture, and the example of our Saviour, who as <hi>Theodoret</hi> saith, <hi>chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the names,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dial. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>and called the signe by the name of his Body.</hi> So that when they say, <hi>the Body is on the altar, the Bloud is in the Chalice,</hi> and so of the rest: the meaning by this rule is, <hi>the Sacrament of the Body and Bloud is there,</hi> or <hi>the Body and Bloud is there Sacramentally.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But in vouching <hi>Irenaeus</hi> what is the reason you curtal one place, and adde vnto another? Meant you to play the <hi>Giant Procrustes,</hi> and to shorten the one because it was too long for your bed, and to stretch out the other because it was too short? For whereas to those words, <hi>the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist of the Bloud and Body of Christ is made, Irenaeus</hi> addeth immediatly, <hi>by which the substance of our flesh is augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and consisteth</hi>: this you thought good to omit because it maketh directly against you. For it is not the naturall <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Bloud</hi> of Christ, whereby our <hi>Bodies</hi> are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished and increased. Yet in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> by his Body &amp; Bloud they waxe and grow. <hi>Ergo</hi> by his <hi>Symbolicall Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> and <hi>Bloud,</hi> the Bread and Wine still remaining.

whereas <hi>Irenaeus</hi> saith, <hi>The Eucharist consisteth of two things, one earthly, another heavenly</hi>: you adde, <hi>the earthly thing is the old forme of bread, the heauenly is the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ newly made vnder that forme.</hi> But this is your owne <hi>Glosse,</hi> and no part of the <hi>Text:</hi> and such a <hi>Glosse</hi> as corrupteth the <hi>Text.</hi> For <hi>Irenaeus</hi> neuer dreamt of your <hi>Formes</hi> and <hi>Accidents</hi> without <hi>substance:</hi> and his plaine meaning is, that whereas before <hi>Consecration</hi> there was but one thing, and that <hi>earthly,</hi> namely Bread, now it is made the <hi>Eucharist</hi> consisting of two things, the one <hi>Earthly,</hi> namely Bread, the other <hi>Heauenly,</hi> to wit, the Body of Christ.</p>

                     <p>It is not <hi>common bread</hi> saith <hi>Iustin.</hi> What of that?

saith farther, <hi>As the word became flesh, so is bread made the body.</hi> What after the same manner?

Yet this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth no <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> For no power is able to make a Sacrament, &amp; by earthly creatures to convay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs heavenly <hi>Graces,</hi> saue only that which is <hi>Divine.</hi>

                     <p>This <hi>Canon</hi> here by you alleaged came but very late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to light: for it is found neither in <hi>Ruffin,</hi> nor in <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samon,</hi> nor any of the <hi>Tomes</hi> of the <hi>Counsells</hi> heretofore published, except those of the newest impression.

                     <p>Indeed if you haue the <hi>Vniforme consent of expositions throughout the whole Christian world concurring with you and the whole ranke of Fathers throughout every age stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with you in this</hi> (as you suppose) <hi>vndoubted truth</hi>: I must needs confesse it both is and ought to be a sufficient <hi>Motiue</hi> vnto you, to perswade assent vnto the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But if vpon due examination you finde that not one of them all doth so expound as you doe, and that your Author hath presented you with a list of names only, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steed of the <hi>Whole ranke of Fathers</hi> bearing witnesse and giuing evidence for you: I hope as it ought so it will proue a sufficient <hi>Retentiue</hi> against your <hi>Motiue.</hi> This that it may yet more plainely appeare, giue me leaue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conclude, to recapitulate what hath beene said, and as it were in a briefe <hi>Synopsis</hi> to lay before your eyes the weaknesse and impertinence of all your allegations. First you vouch the authority of some who are vehemently suspected even by your owne <hi>Rabbies</hi> not to bee the men whose names they beare, and therefore cannot bee very

authenticall. Such are <hi>Ignatius, Cyril</hi> of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> in his <hi>Catechismes, Ambrose de Sacramentis &amp; my sterijs ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiandis, Eusebius Emissenus, Cyprian de coenâ Domini,</hi> the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> and <hi>Magnetes.</hi> Againe, some you alleage, who by reason of their nonage deserue not to be reckoned in the number of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and so are too young to beare witnesse in these businesses. Such are <hi>Damascen, Theophylact, Euthymius, Nicephorus,</hi> and <hi>Rupertus,</hi> who besides his minority, was also in this point little better then an <hi>Heretike.</hi> Thirdly, among the true <hi>Fathers</hi> some affirme the <hi>Sacraments</hi> of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be <hi>Figures</hi> of ours. Yet thereby they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge no more <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> of <hi>bread</hi> into the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist</hi> then of <hi>Water</hi> in <hi>Baptisme.</hi> Fourthly, others affirm that Christs true body is in the <hi>Sacrament</hi>: and we affirm the same also. But that hee is there <hi>corporally</hi> in such sort as you imagine, they affirme not. Fiftly, they say that the <hi>bread</hi> is changed and made the <hi>body</hi> of Christ: &amp; wee say the same with them. But that it is done by a <hi>substantiall change</hi> of <hi>bread</hi> into <hi>body</hi> they say not. Sixtly, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid vs to doubt of Christs words, &amp; to enquire the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner How. We doubt not of them, &amp; thinke the manner to be inexplicable. But they say not that to reiect your grosse and <hi>Capernaiticall manner</hi> is to doubt of Christs truth. Seauenthly, some of them say it is not <hi>common Bread,</hi> nor only a <hi>Figuration</hi> of Christs <hi>body:</hi> and we rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily yeeld vnto it. But they say not that whatsoeuer is sanctified, and more then <hi>figureth,</hi> is therefore <hi>transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiated.</hi> Lastly, some say that the <hi>Vnion</hi> and <hi>Coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> betweene Christ and vs is <hi>reall, naturall,</hi> and <hi>bodily.</hi> We hold the same, that we are <hi>bone</hi> of his <hi>bone,</hi> and <hi>flesh</hi> of his <hi>flesh.</hi> But they say not wee are so vnited by recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:23186:285"/>
Christs flesh into our mouthes, nor deny but that it may be done by <hi>Faith</hi> without euer partaking of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</hi> And this is the full summe of all whatsoeuer your witnesses testifie for you: besides which they say nothing at all. Whereby you may now easily perceaue how sleight and impertinent your <hi>Motiues</hi> are, and how little cause of comfort your <hi>Catholikes</hi> haue in <hi>beholding</hi> them. Rather you haue great cause to be ashamed &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded that haue suffered your selfe thus to bee deluded by your Author: who to proue the subsistence of <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> without <hi>subiect,</hi> hath brought you nothing else but meere <hi>Shewes</hi> without <hi>substance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But alas, we poore <hi>Protestants</hi> are so farre from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the consent of all <hi>expositions,</hi> and the <hi>whole ranke of Fathers standing by vs,</hi> that wee haue not so much as <hi>one authority, nor can produce any one at this day that expresly saith that Christs Real body is not in the sacrament, or that it is only a Figure, Signe, or Token thereof.</hi> I beseech you Sir, and can you Papists produce any one of the <hi>Fathers</hi> that expressely saith <hi>Bread is transubstantiated into Christs body</hi>? If you cannot, and yet thinke it sufficient to vouch that which you conceaue to bee equivalent: why doe you so vrge the word <hi>Expressely</hi> vpon vs, &amp; doe not leaue vs that liberty which you assume vnto your selues? But to leaue this advantage, we freely confesse we cannot produce any one <hi>Father</hi> who either <hi>expresly</hi> or by <hi>conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi> saith so. Nay we farther say that they affirme the cleane contrary, namely that <hi>Christs Real body is in the Sacrament,</hi> and that it is not <hi>only a Figure, Signe,</hi> or <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thereof.</hi> But be it knowne vnto you that wee affirme the same together with them, and it is but your dreame to imagine otherwise. For as oftentimes you haue heard,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:23186:286"/>
we deny not the <hi>Presence</hi> of <hi>Christs Body,</hi> but that <hi>manner of Presence</hi> which you obtrude vnto vs. Neither doe wee say that it is <hi>only a Figure</hi>: for besides <hi>signification,</hi> wee acknowledge that it also <hi>exhibiteth Christ Iesus</hi> himselfe, and <hi>sealeth</hi> vp all his <hi>Promises</hi> vnto vs. As for those <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent peeces of some Fathers speeches, which,</hi> you say, <hi>we now and then pretend to alleadge,</hi> I hope you shall by &amp; by finde them so pertinent and direct, that your <hi>Author</hi> who ever he be, with all his learning and skill, shall never be able to satisfie them. For now hauing fully answered and dispatched all what you haue said for your selfe in behalfe of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi>: it remaineth that I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the promise made you in the beginning, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate that this Doctrine of yours, first crosseth the truth of Scripture, secondly overturneth the <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> thirdly destroyeth the nature of a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> fourthly gainesayeth the perpetuall consent of antiquity, and lastly implieth in it infinite contradictions. I will fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish all in as few words as I can.</p>
                     <p>First it crosseth the truth of Scripture.

If you know it not, then neither doe you knowe what it is that is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into <hi>Christs Body.</hi> If you knowe it, let me entreat you to expresse it. Certainely it must either bee <hi>Christs Body</hi> or <hi>Bread.

These things being thus granted, out of them I frame this argument. That <hi>which destroyeth the signe in the sacrament by confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with the thing signified, making it invisible and insensible, and holding no analogie or proportion with that whereof it is a signe, destroyeth the nature of a Sacrament: But your doctrine of the Reall Presence by Transubstantiation doth all this</hi>: Ergo <hi>it also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyeth the nature of the Sacrament.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> or first <hi>Proposition</hi> is by you, as wee haue now shewed, yeelded vnto vs, and cannot bee denied. The <hi>Minor</hi> or second <hi>Proposition</hi> I thus proue in every particular. And first that it destroyeth the <hi>signe.</hi> For if any remaine, either it is <hi>bread,</hi> or the <hi>Accidents</hi> of <hi>bread,</hi> or the <hi>body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>: for there is not a fourth. But <hi>bread</hi> it cannot bee: for the <hi>Element</hi> is not a <hi>signe</hi> vntill it be <hi>consecrated,</hi> and <hi>bread</hi> is no sooner <hi>consecrated</hi> but forthwith it ceaseth to be. And if it be not, then neither is it a <hi>signe:</hi> for of that which is not, nothing can be affirmed. Againe, the <hi>Accidents</hi> of <hi>bread,</hi> as <hi>Colour, Savours, measure,</hi> and the like, are not it. For besides that it is impossible, that <hi>Accidents</hi> should haue any <hi>subsistence</hi> without their <hi>subiect,</hi> the <hi>Being</hi> of an <hi>Accident</hi> being <hi>to be in its subiect</hi>: it is very strange and vnconceauable, if they could, how the meere <hi>Accidents</hi> of <hi>bread</hi> should represent and signifie the <hi>body</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> The
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:23186:292"/>
rather, because the <hi>signe</hi> was ordained by <hi>Christ</hi> to bee a helpe vnto our <hi>Faith,</hi> and to lead vs as it were by the hand vnto the thing <hi>signified.</hi> Whereas the <hi>Accidents</hi> of <hi>bread</hi> without the <hi>substance</hi> thereof are rather lets and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances vnto vs, and with no more reason can bee called <hi>signes</hi> of Christs <hi>body,</hi> then a darke cloud that keepeth off the light of the Sunne from our eyes, may bee called a <hi>signe</hi> or <hi>Representation</hi> of the Sunne.

Neither finally is the <hi>body</hi> of Christ it. For that is the thing <hi>signified</hi>: and by your rule the <hi>signe</hi> and the thing <hi>signified</hi> must be two differing and distinct things, not the same. Which also perfectly agreeth with right reason. For seeing nothing is opposite vnto it selfe, &amp; the <hi>signe</hi> and the thing <hi>signified</hi> are opposed one vnto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by way of <hi>Relation,</hi> they being <hi>Relatiue</hi> tearmes: it cannot bee that the thing <hi>signified</hi> should bee one and the same with the <hi>signe,</hi> and consequently that Christs <hi>body</hi> should be a signe of it selfe. The <hi>conclusion</hi> of all is, that if neither <hi>bread,</hi> nor the <hi>Accidents</hi> of <hi>bread,</hi> nor the <hi>body</hi> of Christ be the <hi>signe</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> then there is no <hi>signe</hi> at all therein: and if no <hi>signe,</hi> then is the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> destroyed, a <hi>signe</hi> being necessary to the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution thereof.

shape to other waters and is subiect to corruption: but the holy Ghosts might cometh to the water through the Priests blessing, and it can after wash the body and soule from all sin through Ghostly might. Behold now wee see two things in this one creature. After true nature that water is corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble water, and after ghostly mystery hath hollowing might. So also if wee behold that holy housel after bodily vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, then see wee that it is a creature corruptible and mutable: if we acknowledge therein ghostly might, then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand wee that life is therein, and that it giueth immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality to them that eate it with beleefe. Much is betwixt the invisible might of the holy housel, &amp; the visible shape of his proper nature. It is naturally corruptible Bread and corruptible Wine, &amp; is by might of Gods word truly Christs Body and his bloud: not so notwithstanding bodily but Ghostly. Much is betwixt the body Christ suffered in, and the body that is hallowed to housel. The body truly that Christ suffered in was borne of the flesh of Mary with bloud and with bone, with skinne and with sinews, with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane limmes, with a reasonable soule liuing: and his Ghost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly body which we call the housel is gathered of many cornes, without bloud and bone, without limme, without Soule.

Had the Church in those daies verily beleeued that it had been the true and <hi>Real body</hi> of Christ: doe you thinke they would so haue profaned it by feasting vpon it, and bestowing it on children? Or that they would with such impietie and sacrilege haue burned and consumed it in the fire? It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together incredible. As incredible therefore that they held it to be the <hi>Lords Body.</hi> But of <hi>Antiquity</hi> enough.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly and lastly it implieth in it <hi>innumerable contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>: which according to the rule of <hi>Logick,</hi> cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly be true at once. For truth evermore agreeth with truth, and never crosseth it: and whatsoeuer resisteth or contradicteth truth is <hi>Falshood.</hi> Hence the rule, and the infallible rule of your owne Schoole, that <hi>God cannot doe those things that imply contradiction.</hi> For <hi>contradiction</hi> is not in the bosome of God, seeing he is essentially <hi>Truth</hi> it selfe. And being, not yea and nay, but yea and <hi>Amen,</hi> hee cannot say yea is nay or nay is yea. And if hee cannot say it, neither can he will it to be so. If he cannot will it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be so. For what God cannot will cannot bee done. Neither doe we herein derogate from the <hi>Power</hi> of God: for whatsoeuer is against his <hi>Truth</hi> is against his <hi>Power,</hi> and therefore as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Powerfully hee cannot doe it.</hi> Which being so, let vs see whether this <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
                        <pb n="118" facs="tcp:23186:298"/>
of yours imply such <hi>contradictions</hi> or no. First you say that <hi>Bread</hi> is made the <hi>Body of Christ,</hi> and yet that the <hi>Body of Christ</hi> was before <hi>Bread</hi> was made his <hi>Body.</hi> Now if to vnmake that which never was, imply <hi>contradiction,</hi> by the same proportion to make that which already is implies it also. That which is not made as yet is not, and that which is already made is, and is, and is not, be direct <hi>contradictories.</hi> Is it possible to kill a dead man? Or to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the child that is already borne? As impossible is it to make him of <hi>Bread,</hi> who was long before he is pretended to be made. Secondly, to be locally in a place and not lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally in a place is a <hi>contradiction.</hi> But that Christs <hi>Body</hi> is locally in heauen you all confesse, and that at the same time he is not locally in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> you likewise ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge. Can you reconcile this <hi>contradiction?</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides what confusion of speech is this, Christ is in a place but not locally, or as in a place? As if a man should say, such a one is reasonable but not reasonably or as reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and learned but not learnedly or as learned. How then? Certes as vnreasonable and vnlearned. Thirdly, I hope you will not deny vnto Christ as much power as you grant to every pettie <hi>Masse-Priest.</hi> But you grant power vnto them to reserue the <hi>consecrated Hoste</hi> vntill the next day, yea vntill it beginne to corrupt and putrify. If then our Saviour instituting his supper the even before his <hi>Passion</hi> had deliuered vnto his <hi>Apostles</hi> any part of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> to be kept vnto the end of the next day: I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand whether the <hi>Body</hi> in the <hi>Pixe</hi> should haue beene scourged, crucified, thrust through, and slaine, together with that which was fastned to the <hi>Crosse</hi>? If no, as your <hi>Church</hi> concludeth: then haue we here another <hi>contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Christs Body</hi> is at the same time scourged and not
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:23186:298"/>
scourged, crucified and not crucified, thrust through and not thrust through, slaine and not slaine. Fourthly, you say that the Body of Christ is contained vnder the <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> of <hi>Bread,</hi> yea that the whole Body is in every the least crum of the <hi>Hoste.</hi> Yet you say it is much greater then that which containeth it, and elsewhere besides the <hi>Accidents.</hi> You say also that <hi>Christ</hi> at his last supper ate himselfe and swallowed downe his owne body into his stomacke: so that his stomacke containing himselfe, hee was both within and without himselfe. Which in effect is a meere <hi>contradiction,</hi> the <hi>Accidents,</hi> the <hi>stomacke</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth and not containeth, Christs Body is contained &amp; not contained. Fiftly, you confesse that the Body of Christ then when hee celebrated his <hi>Supper</hi> did see and heare, and moue, and breath, was weake and passible and subiect vnto death. Yet you say that the same time the Body of Christ in the <hi>Eucharist</hi> could neither see, not heare, nor moue, nor breath, but was vtterly insensible, impassible, and without infirmitie. And is not this a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest <hi>contradiction</hi>? If you say he is passible in the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but after an impassible manner: you shall pardon vs if we answer it with no other then laughter. For it is as if you should say the crow is blacke after a white manner, or that the world is square after a round manner. Sixtly, before <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> was invented it went for cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in <hi>Philosophie</hi> that the very essence and being of an <hi>Accident</hi> is to be in the <hi>subiect.</hi> Yet you say that in the <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> the <hi>Accidents</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi> are in no <hi>subiect.</hi> But for an <hi>Accident</hi> to be and not to be is a <hi>contradiction</hi>: for not to be in is not to be. As well may you say a <hi>substance</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth not, or the shining shineth not, or the liuing liueth not, as that the <hi>Accident</hi> doth not <hi>accidere</hi> or befall the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:23186:299"/>
                        <hi>subiect.</hi> Seauenthly, every <hi>creature</hi> is measured by time and place. If therefore it bee a <hi>contradiction</hi> to say such a thing is and yet is in no time: it is as cleare a <hi>contradiction</hi> to say such a thing is and yet it is limited in no place. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse you say that the <hi>body</hi> of Christ in the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> occupieth no place. Againe, if it be a <hi>contradiction</hi> to say that a man at the same instant of time liueth in the fifteenth and sixteenth hundred yeare of Christ, because there is a great distance betweene them, and they are not the same number: as palpable a <hi>contradiction</hi> is it to say the <hi>Body</hi> of Christ is at once both in Heauen and Earth, seeing earth is not heauen nor heauen earth, and there is such a vast space betwixt them.<note place="margin">Phys. l. 4. c 6.7.8</note> Eightly, <hi>Aristotle</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth that vacuity or emptinesse is impossible, &amp; if you should grant it, infinite <hi>contradictions</hi> would follow. But your doctrine establisheth it. For what is <hi>vacuitie</hi> but a <hi>space</hi> vnfilled by a Body? I aske then when the <hi>Cup</hi> is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated,</hi> wherewith is it filled? With wine? So indeed it seemeth: but after <hi>consecration</hi> you say it is not Wine, &amp; that which is not there filleth it not. With <hi>bloud</hi> then? Nor that. For that which filleth the <hi>Cup</hi> must every way be as large as the hollow surface of the <hi>Cup.</hi> But the <hi>bloud</hi> is not so: for it wanteth <hi>Dimensive quantitie.</hi> Unlesse therefore the <hi>Accidents</hi> help (and they cannot being no Bodies) the Cup must needs bee empty and void: which cannot but imply <hi>contradiction.</hi> For voidnesse, as the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher</hi> saith, is the root of infinite <hi>contradictions.</hi> Ninth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and lastly, if one and the same Body may be in mo pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces then one at once, why not in a thousand? And if in a thousand, why not in a thousand thousand millions? If so, then a little point or droppe continuing still in the same <hi>Quantitie,</hi> may occupie as much space as the greatest
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:23186:299"/>
mountaine or the whole <hi>Ocean.</hi> For so many may the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall places be that all put together may make a greater space: then which what plainer <hi>contradiction?</hi> Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to these few, I might easily adde six hundred other as grosse absurdities: as that Christ at the same time is to himselfe both neere and farre off, aboue &amp; beneath, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and without, before and behind, at his right and at his left hand, that he is also elder and younger, sooner and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, shorter and taller, broader and narrower, thicker and thinner, greater and lesser then himselfe, and such like of the same garbe. But I study to be briefe, &amp; it is high time <hi>to remoue my hand,</hi> as they say, from the <hi>Table.</hi> Onely I must forewarne you, that if being vnable to vntie these knots, you shall attempt to cut them asunder with the sword of <hi>Gods Omnipotence,</hi> you shall but loose your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. For if they be <hi>contradictions</hi> (as vndoubtedly they are) your <hi>Angelicall Doctor</hi> can tell you,<note place="margin">Sum. p. 1. q. 25. a. 2.3.</note> that they fall not within the compasse of <hi>Divine Power.</hi> So that of force you must either demonstrate that these things are not <hi>contradictorie,</hi> which I am sure you can neuer doe: or as becommeth Christian ingenuity, you must for ever bid farewell to <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> and yeeld vnto the truth discouered vnto you.</p>
                     <p>And thus at length by Gods assistance haue I finished the taske you haue laid vpon me, &amp; fully answered what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer here you haue alleaged in maintenance of your <hi>Reall Presence.</hi> My desire now is that laying aside all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, you will but with indifference read what I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied therevnto. Which if you shall vouchsafe to doe, I perswade my selfe it will make you to remit much of that confidence you had in this cause, when first you sent this <hi>Schedule</hi> vnto me. Especially if withall you consider that

the wittiest and subtlest heads amongst you could never finde it so clearely and strongly grounded either vpon <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Fathers,</hi> as you pretend. <hi>Scotus</hi> sirnamed the <hi>subtle Doctor</hi> affirmeth,<note place="margin">In 4. dist. 11. q. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>that there is extant in Scripture no place so expresse, as without declaration of the Church can evidently constraine a man to admit of Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And this, saith <hi>Bellarmine, is not altogether vnproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

And <hi>Father Garnet</hi> in a <hi>conference</hi> with the <hi>Deanes</hi> of the <hi>Chappell, Pauls,</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> being in particular asked the like, answered very perplexedly, not daring to hazard his saluation therevpon. All these testimonies duly pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and considered, you must needs acknowledge, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse you see better then these quick-sighted Eagles, that you haue not so strong hold either in Scripture, or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or right reason as you imagined: and that not only the name, but the <hi>Doctrine</hi> also of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> hath beene but of late created an article of your <hi>Faith.</hi> It remaineth that I entreat you, these things vndoubtedly being thus, that you suffer not your selfe any longer to be beguilded with novelties vnder pretence of antiquitie: but rather that you open your eyes, and stretch forth your armes to embrace the truth, now that she offereth her selfe so manifestly vnto you. And this I intreat the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly, because of the great danger that followeth vpon
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:23186:301"/>
this errour. For if Christ bee not present in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in such sort as you hold, there was never either <hi>seen or heard the like Idolatrie vnto yours,</hi> as your own <hi>Coster</hi> confesseth. <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>it is a more tolerable error to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship Images of silver, or gold, or other stuffe with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, or a red cloath on a pike with the Lieflanders, or liuing creatures with the Egyptians, then to adore a morsell of bread.</hi> Oh therefore let me yet againe beseech you, and that by the dearest name of Iesus Christ, to pitty your owne soule, and with all speed to retire your selfe from <hi>Babylon,</hi> the mother of all <hi>spirituall</hi> whoredome. Hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore happily your ignorance might in part excuse you: but now that the light hath shined vpon you, if wilfully you close your eies against it, you are altogether vnexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable, and these papers one day will appeare in iudgement against you. Oh how glad would the blessed <hi>Angels</hi> in heaven bee, might they once behold your <hi>conversion?</hi> How readily and louingly would the true Church of Christ entertaine you? and how humbly thankfull would my poore selfe be vnto the <hi>Divine Maiestie,</hi> if through his blessing these endeauours of mine might be a meanes to reclaime you? For my part I haue done what belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vnto me, that truth I haue both propounded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated vnto you. To turne the heart is not in my power: that I leaue vnto God whose office it is. Yet will I neuer cease to addresse my vowes vnto him for you, if at any time hee may bee pleased in Iesus Christ to haue compassion vpon you.</p>

Which how it can bee, and yet no Transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you vnderstand not. The word Transubstantiation was indeed devised in the counsell of Lateran: but the thing was alwaies beleeved of the ancient Fathers, as appeareth by their words, Conversion, Mutation, and the like.</hi>

                     <p>Had you attentiuely read my <hi>Answer,</hi> you would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver haue said I excepted to two or three Passages only. For I excepted to all the passages of <hi>Ignatius, Cyril of Hierusalem in his Catechismes, Ambrose de Sacramentis,</hi> and <hi>Mysterijs initiandis, Eusebius Emissenus, Cyprian de caena Domini, the Canon of the Nicen counsell,</hi> and <hi>Magnetes,</hi> as suspected by your owne <hi>Rabbies</hi> not to be the men whose names they beare. Againe of <hi>Damascen, Theophylact, Euthymius, Nicephorus,</hi> and <hi>Rupertus,</hi> as being Punies and too young to be <hi>Fathers:</hi> besides those many <hi>Passages</hi> which are miserably either curtald or rackt or falsely alleaged. Neither are their words so plain
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:23186:308"/>
for you as you pretend. For I haue made it to appeare, that some of them say nothing at all for you, some speak rather against you then for you: and to those that seeme to say any thing, I haue opposed a whole grand <hi>Iury,</hi> speaking farre more plainely on our side. For what words can be more plaine then these, <hi>This is my body, that is, the figure of my Body</hi>; that Christ said <hi>This bread is my body,</hi> which your owne men grant cannot bee true vnlesse <hi>figuratiuely vnderstood</hi>: that <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine still are what they were,</hi> that the <hi>Nature of bread continues,</hi> that <hi>the nature of bread and wine cease not to be, but continue in the propriety of their nature,</hi> that the <hi>signes after consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion depart not from their proper nature, but remaine in their former substance, figure, and forme,</hi> and suchlike many.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps your Fathers speake as plainely. Let vs try that. They say that the <hi>Body, flesh, and bloud of Christ is truly in the Sacrament: Ergo, a Reall Presence.</hi> Who denies it? Transubstantiation is that which you should proue, which <hi>Reall Presence</hi> inferres not. This, you say, you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not. The more is your dulnesse. For <hi>Really</hi> and <hi>Corporally</hi> are not all one: and that which is <hi>Spiritually present</hi> is <hi>Really present,</hi> vnlesse you will say that a spirit is Nothing. Is not the <hi>Bloud of Christ really present in Baptisme</hi> to the washing away of sinne? Is hee not <hi>Really</hi> also present to the <hi>Faith</hi> of every true beleever even out of the <hi>Sacrament?</hi> Doubtlesse he is: and none will deny it, but he that never felt the vertue and efficacy thereof. What should let then but the <hi>Flesh</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> may bee <hi>present</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist Really,</hi> and yet not after the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall manner?</hi> Nay what if I should yeeld you a <hi>corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall presence?</hi> Would that necessarily inferre a <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation</hi>?
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:23186:308"/>
Nothing lesse. For it may be by <hi>consubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi>: the flesh being there together with the <hi>Bread,</hi> without turning the <hi>Bread</hi> into <hi>Flesh.</hi> Neither may you deny this to be possible, vnlesse you will deny the <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and your <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> withall: for therevpon doe you build it. <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> therefore and the <hi>Reall presence</hi> are not all one. Yea but the <hi>Fathers</hi> vse the tearmes of <hi>Conversion</hi> &amp; <hi>Mutation.</hi> What then? <hi>Ergo Transubstantiation?</hi> A pittifull consequence. For this is to argue from the <hi>Generall</hi> to <hi>Speciall</hi>: as if you should say, It is a colour, therefore it is blacke, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many colours besides blacke. Learne then that Change is a generall word, and there are divers kindes thereof: of <hi>Substance</hi> by <hi>Generation</hi> and <hi>corruption,</hi> of <hi>Quality</hi> by <hi>Alteration,</hi> of <hi>Quantity</hi> by <hi>Augmentation</hi> and <hi>Diminution,</hi> of <hi>Place</hi> by <hi>Lation.</hi> Now he that affirmeth a Change, doth not presently affirme Change of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance: for it may be some other, either of <hi>Quality</hi> or <hi>Quantity,</hi> or <hi>Quantity,</hi> or <hi>Place.</hi> The <hi>Fathers</hi> therefore speaking of a Change in the Sacrament, may as well meane a Change of Alteration in the Vse and Uertue of the Elements, as of Substance by way of <hi>Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And so for ought the <hi>Fathers</hi> say, <hi>Transubstantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> may still be a brat of the <hi>Lateran Councells</hi>: disputed of perhaps before, but neuer beleeved as an <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> till then.</p>

Whereof his predecessor <hi>Gregory</hi> the great seemed to prophecy, when writing against <hi>Iohn B.</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> for vsurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that title,<note place="margin">Lib. 4. ep. 34.</note> he gathereth from thence that the times of <hi>Antichrist</hi> are at hand.

It was a good while after this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> began to appeare. <hi>Damascen</hi> in the East not contenting himselfe with the old language of the Church, fell a coyning of new <hi>Phrases,</hi> yet reached not home to <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> A hundred yeares after <hi>Amalarius</hi> in the west maintained in plaine tearms, <hi>that the simple nature of Bread and wine is turned into a reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nature,</hi>

Not the body which hee suffered in, but the body of which hee spake when he blessed the bread &amp; wine to housel the night before his suffering, and said by the blessed bread this is my body, and againe by the holy wine, this is my blood, &amp;c.</hi> The other likewise saith thus, <hi>The Lord which hallowed housel before his suffering, and saith that the bread was his owne body, and the wine was truely his bloud, halloweth dayly by the hand of the Priest, bread to his body, and wine to his blood, in spirituall mystery, as we read in bookes. And yet notwithstanding that liuely bread is not bodily so, nor the selfe-same body that Christ suffered in: nor that holy wine is the Saviours bloud which was shed for vs in bodily thing, but in spirituall vnderstanding. Both bee truely, that bread his body, and that wine also his blood, as was the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly bread which we call Manna, that fed forty yeares Gods people, and the cleare water which did then run from the stone in the wildernesse was truly his blood, as Paul wrot in one of his Epistles.</hi> Thus he.

First the Passage cited out of <hi>Bibliander</hi> maketh against you, not vs. For if it be Bread and Wine which is sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed, then they remaine after Consecration, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthroweth <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> If they doe not remaine, and the Body and Bloud of Christ only be offered: then were those <hi>Iewes</hi> false <hi>Prophets,</hi> and foretold nothing but lies. Secondly, the Doctor acknowledging an <hi>Euchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall Sacrifice,</hi> neither is forced therevnto by any such testimony, nor is against <hi>Mason</hi> or any other <hi>Protestant</hi>: for they all acknowledge the same together with him. But I thinke you knew not that <hi>Eucharist</hi> signifieth <hi>Thankesgiuing</hi>: or else you would never haue thought it strange he should acknowledge a Sacrifice of Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing. Lastly, I am strongly perswaded that when these testimonies of <hi>R. Cahana,</hi> R. <hi>Iuda, R. Simeon,</hi> and the rest shall come to the ripping, they will proue <hi>Hippocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taurs</hi> and meere fictions. For (supposing you are in the right) is it likely that such fellowes as these should either
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:23186:317"/>
know or speake more clearly of the mysteries of our Faith, then any of the ancient Prophets, inspired of the holy Ghost, and sent of purpose to foretell to them? Or is it probable that your greatest <hi>Rabbins,</hi> and among them Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> searching curiously into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very corner, to find witnesses of all sorts, would yet care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly omit these, if they were so plaine and pregnant for you as you pretend? Verily when the Doctor saith, that no Doctor for a 1000 yeares after Christ, no nor Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiator almost, ever spake more plainely: it is a meere flout, and argues how lightly he esteemes of the authority. But of this enough vntill I bee more certainly informed. Only thus, to alleage <hi>Iewes,</hi> is not to approue your sense of the <hi>Fathers.</hi>

                        <hi>The now Archb. of</hi> Canterbury <hi>saith, and with him Midleton agreeth, that Berengarius was called into questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for denying Transubstantiation, and he yeelded once or twice to recant and abiure the Doctrine he held: Ergo hee assureth vs Transubstantiation was the Doctrine of the Church constant and generall hundreds of yeares before the Lateran councell defined it, yea farther, hee assureth vs, that to deny it was Heresy to be recanted.</hi>

                     <p>Had not your Author wanted, or forehead, or braine, or both, he would never haue made such a shamelesse &amp; senselesse inference. If he had said, <hi>Ergo</hi> many beleeued Transubstantiation before the <hi>Lateran councell,</hi> hee had kept his tongue within compasse: but saying, <hi>Ergo</hi> it was the <hi>constant and generall doctrine for hundred of yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi>
                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:23186:317"/>
his mouth overfloweth, &amp; it is a lye with a latchet. For be it knowne vnto you, the Church of <hi>England</hi> held it not, as I haue already proued out of the <hi>Homily</hi> of <hi>Abbat Aelfrick.</hi> Neither did the <hi>Waldenses</hi> hold it: whose number yet was very great, and they dispersed through all the countries of Christendome. And if you thinke that <hi>Berengarius</hi> stood single &amp; by himselfe in this point, you are much deceaued: for hee had as many for him as were against him, and it was nothing but the tyranny of the B. of <hi>Rome</hi> that bare him down. Howbeit the <hi>French Churches</hi> still resisted both him and his <hi>Synods,</hi> &amp; divers meeting together in <hi>Anjow</hi> and <hi>Turon,</hi> resolue against him, and subscribe vnto <hi>Berengarius.</hi> But to put the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of all doubt,<note place="margin">Benno in vit. Hild.</note> it is reported of <hi>Pope Hildebrand,</hi> that he appointed a Fast of three daies together with a solemn <hi>Procession,</hi> to entreat of God some signe from heaven, whereby he might be assured what he was to determine in this businesse. If at that time the head of the Church himselfe staggered, and doubted which way to resolue: is it credible that the rest of the body could bee so setled therein, as generally &amp; constantly for hundreds of yeares to maintaine it? <hi>Apellas</hi> the <hi>Iew</hi> may beleeue it if hee list, not I. Breefly, <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> might well be disputed of some while before the <hi>Lateran Councell:</hi> but held for an <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> it was not vntill then, as I haue else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where shewed out of <hi>Tonstal</hi> and <hi>Scotus.</hi>

                        <hi>The same Bishop and Dr</hi> Field <hi>tell vs that the Greeke Church is a true Church. Yet their Patriarch Ieremie saith. It is the iudgement of the Church, that in the holy supper after consecration and benediction the bread passeth and is
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:23186:318"/>

                     <p>Yet the same Bishop and Doctor tell you also, that a true Church may erre: so that <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> might be an errour though the <hi>Grecians</hi> held it. But the truth is that the <hi>Greeke Church</hi> never held it, as I haue aboue shewed out of the same <hi>Ieremie</hi> &amp; the Councell of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> which you are bound to beleeue. For though the <hi>Patriarch</hi> say <hi>Bread is changed into Body:</hi> yet hee addeth by and by, <hi>the flesh of the Lord which he carried about him was not giuen to the Apostles to eat, nor his bloud to drinke, nor is now in the divine celebration of those mysteries,</hi> which directly overturneth your Change by <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation.</hi> But of this see more aboue. And thus much in answer vnto your first reason, which before I passe vnto the next I must craue leaue to retort vpon you.</p>
                     <p>If you may not yeeld vnto the sense I giue the <hi>Fathers,</hi> because some <hi>Protestants</hi> allow your sense: neither may I yeeld to the sense you giue, because many Papists allow mine. For there is the same law for <hi>Titius</hi> as well as for <hi>Seius.</hi> I assume, but many Papists allow the sense I giue. This if I would follow your course, I might easily proue by all those Popish writers, who acknowledge those words of the Fathers which we obiect against you, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mentioning any of their Answers. But so doing I should shew my selfe as ridiculous and vnconscionable as your Author. Thus therefore, <hi>Scotus, Cameracensis, Caietan, Roffensis, Biel, Occam, Durand, Peter Lombard,</hi> with some Iesuits, and the Canon Law, professe, some of them that they could not finde <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> in the Scriptures, and some that they could not in the Fathers.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:23186:318"/>
Their expresse words you haue in mine Answere, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I referre you: for it would be too long to transcribe them. If so, and all these were grand Papists, I haue no reason to beleeue you or your Author rather then them: nay great reason haue I to cleaue the faster vnto my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as better according both with Scripture &amp; Fathers.</p>

                        <hi>Your second reason, There are amongst vs differences e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in many essentiall and fundamentall points, as namely betweene Protestants and Puritans, whatsoever D. Abbat, Doue, Willet, Powel, Sr</hi> 
                        <hi>Edward Hobby, Rogers, &amp; others say to the contrary. And this you proue by Rogers, Covel, Ormrode, Parks, Willet, Powel, and sundry others.</hi>

                     <p>That there are differences and dissentions amongst vs is too true and cannot bee denied. This therefore wee grant. But the Consequence which you inferre therevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Ergo</hi> you may not yeeld vnto my iudgement or any of our side, I deny. For to make this follow, you must of necessitie hold, that where there are dissentions, there you may not harken to any side. A dangerous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate Position: and the very Objection of the <hi>Iewes</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Christianitie,<note place="margin">Clem. Alex. Strom. l. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>We may not beleeue because of your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions.</hi> By which reason, as you may not heare vs, so may not we you, nor <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> any of vs all how Orthodoxe soeuer, because the Christian world is still full of contentions. A man would thinke that diversitie of opinions, especially in matters concerning soule and Salvation, should rather quicken and stirre vp the minde diligently among all to search which is the truest: then
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:23186:319"/>
to cause it sit still, and forbeare assent vntill all sides be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded. Neither let any pretend inabilitie: for as <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi> saith, <hi>Seeing we acknowledge the scriptures, which are so true and plaine,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hom. 33. in Act.</note> 
                        <hi>it will be an easie matter for to iudge. And tell me, hast thou any wit or iudgement? For it is not a mans part barely to receaue whatsoever hee heareth. Say not, I am a learner and may be no iudge, I can condemne no opinion: this is but a shift, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Gerson</hi> rendreth the true reason hereof,<note place="margin">De Exam. doct. pag. 1. con. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>The triall and examination of doctrines concerning Faith belongeth not only to the Councell &amp; Pope but also to every one that is sufficiently learned in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, because every man is a sufficient iudge of that hee knoweth.</hi> But ô yee miserable servitude and slauery of you, the common sort of Papists! your eyes are puld out of your heads, neither are you allowed the vse of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense and reason. The Scriptures by which you should see are wrested out of your hands as a dangerous booke. If you will see, it must be by another mans eyes. Your Faith must depend vpon the warrant of some e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocating Priest. And whatsoever is said to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary though never so soundly proued, you may in no case harken to it: for why, there are dissentions among you.</p>
                     <p>This reason being thus fully answered, I might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more adoe passe on to the next, but that I see by your spinning it to such a length you make great store of it. Let vs therefore bestow a word or two more vpon it. <hi>There are,</hi> say you, <hi>dissentions amongst vs.</hi> True. And was there ever, or will there ever be a Church so happy as to be altogether free of them? If not: why doe you vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid them vnto vs? Is it because notwithstanding them we count one another brethren &amp; members of the same
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:23186:319"/>
Church. That is an Argument of our charity, and that we dare not cut off, and condemne as <hi>Hereticks</hi> every one that differeth though never so little from vs in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: whereas you presently condemne to the pit of Hell all Christians whatsoever, wheresoever, and how many soever that will not vaile bonnet vnto the Popes Miter, and beleeue all to bee true that hee resolues vpon. But what? May not brethren disagree and yet continue bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? Or doth every quarrell exclude out of the Church of God? I trow not. For then <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas, Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul, Victor</hi> and <hi>Polycrates, Cyril</hi> and <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret, Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>Theophilus, Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome, Hierome</hi> and <hi>Ruffin,</hi> and sundry others should not be brethren. Nay the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West</hi> Churches dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting about <hi>Easter,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>African</hi> about <hi>Rebaptization</hi> should be no true Churches. Yea but our differences are not in pettie matters, but essentiall &amp; fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall points. And such were also in the Churches of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and <hi>Galathians:</hi> for in the one they differed about the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the dead, in the other about the necessary observation of the law of <hi>Moses</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Gospell.<note place="margin">De not.

But by your leaue sir, your Author overlashes when he saith we differ in points Essentiall and Fundamentall: neither doe our <hi>Divines</hi> only say it, as you beare vs in hand, but clearely demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate it also. And indeed all the quarrell is rather about the shell then the kernell, that is, the outward gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; ceremonies of the Church rather then the <hi>Faith</hi> of the Church: or at the most, it is rather about some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:23186:320"/>
and conclusions in <hi>Divinitie,</hi> then the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples themselues, and those truths that are necessary vnto salvation. For as for the <hi>Article of Christs descent into Hell,</hi> though your Author would insinuate the contrary, yet there is not one of vs but willingly subscribes vnto it: and acknowledgeth that Christ hath <hi>spoiled Hell,</hi> and triumphed over <hi>Principalities</hi> and <hi>Powers,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. 2.15.</note> and all the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of our salvation. But whether he did this by <hi>descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding locally</hi> in <hi>soule</hi> into the <hi>Hell</hi> of the <hi>Damned,</hi> or <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually</hi> and by the power of his <hi>Godhead,</hi> is all the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongst vs: whereby for ought I see, we neither over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne the <hi>Article,</hi> nor dissolue brotherhood. And your selfe must needs confesse so much, vnlesse you will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime brotherhood with <hi>Durandus,</hi> and condemne him of a Fundamentall errour together with vs. For hee held that the soule of Christ descended into Hell, not in the substance thereof,<note place="margin">In 3 dist. 22. q. 3.</note> but by certaine <hi>effects.</hi> And heare the resolution of <hi>Suares</hi> the Iesuit touching this <hi>Article,</hi>

                        <hi>If by an article of faith,</hi> saith he, <hi>we vnderstand a truth which all the faithfull are bound explicitly to knowe and beleeue: so I doe not thinke it necessary to reckon this among the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith, because it is not a matter altogether so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for all men, and because for this reason peradventure it is omitted in the Nicen Creed, the knowledge of which Creed seemeth to be sufficient for fulfilling the Precept of Faith. Lastly, for this cause peradventure</hi> Augustine, <hi>and other of the Fathers expounding the Creed, doe not vnfold this mystery vnto the people.</hi> Thus he. But perhaps your Author hath reason for what he saies. Certainly none at all. Only he rakes together all the vehement and passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate speeches, whatsoever hee can finde to haue passed from any of our pens in heat of contention, to worke all
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:23186:320"/>
the disgrace he can vpon vs. And if any of vs for proofe of his Conclusion draw his Argument from an <hi>Article</hi> of Faith, &amp; then shall say (as sometimes through too much eagernesse men vse to doe) the Controversie is about such an <hi>Article</hi>: loe, saith your Author, by and by, a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in matters Essentiall and Fundamentall, whereas notwithstanding we all agree in the Article, and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference lies only in the Conclusion.

                        <note place="margin">Append. p. 3.</note>That which you obiect out of D. <hi>Field,</hi> D. <hi>Field</hi> him selfe hath long since at large answered. I will contract it as briefly as I can. The <hi>Summe</hi> is, the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is not now the same it was before <hi>Luther.</hi> His reasons. First, the then Church was the whole number of Christians subiect to the <hi>Papal tyranny,</hi> of whom many desired to be free of the yoke, and as soone as <hi>Luther</hi> began to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose shooke it off: but the now Church is the multitude of those that adore the plenitude of <hi>Papal</hi> power, or are content to be vnder the yoke still. Secondly, the <hi>Roman Church</hi> then consisted of men not hauing meanes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:23186:323"/>
and so not erring pertinaciously: but the now Church consisteth of those who obstinately resist the truth, or at least consent in outward communion with them. So that they might be saued in their simplicity, and these perish in their contradiction. Thirdly, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church</hi> then had in it the same abuses &amp; superstitions it hath now, and those that erred the same errours: but it had also those that disliked them, and thought right in those points wherein the rest erred. These were true liu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing members of the Church: those a faction in the Church. In regard of those it was truly a Church, that is, a multitude of men professing Christ and baptized: in regard of these a true Church, that is, a multitude of men holding a sauing profession of Christ. Lastly, the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours then taught in the Church, were not the Doctrines of the Church: but now they are the Doctrines of that Church. That they were not then the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> appeareth thus. The Doctrines then taught were either those which all consented vnto, such as are the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Creed,</hi> or those errors which many then taught, or the contrary truths opposed to those errors. The first were absolutly the Churches Doctrine. So were the third though all received them not, because they were theirs, who were so in the Church that they were the Church. But the second were not, because they were taught by the faction in the Church, and not consented vnto by them that were the Church. Thus farre the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi>: who at length concludeth, that whatsoever it hath beene, the present <hi>Romish Church</hi> is not that true Church of God, whose communion wee must embrace, whose directions we must follow, and in whose judgement we must rest.</p>

                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:23186:324"/>Yea but D. <hi>Covell</hi> in the name of all the rest affirmeth that it is still a true Church, and Salvation may be had in it. In the name of all the rest? Why, who gaue him that commission? and how comes hee to be the mouth of vs all, more then any other of his brethren? Certainly your <hi>Author</hi> much wrongs the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses his reader, to make the private sayings of this man or that man to be the common voice of all. If he haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more largely then can be justified, hee must answere for it himselfe, no reason the whole Church should bee charged with it. You will not endure it amongst your selues: and why should you then obtrude it vpon vs? To the words themselues I answere with D. <hi>Field.</hi>

That which your <hi>Author</hi> farther addes of himselfe, let the same <hi>Willet answer. Though divers</hi> saith hee, <hi>of those ancient Kings became Monks, yet neither was the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall life so farre out of square as now it is, they made it
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:23186:325"/>
not a cloke of idlenesse and filthy liuing, a nursery of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and grosse supertitions: but they desired that life as fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test for contemplation, and free from the encumbrances of the world. Neither doth this one opinion of the excellency of Monasticall life shew them to be resolute Papists: for it followeth not because they were Monks, that consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they held Transubstantiation, worship of images, and the more grosse points of the Romish Catechisme.</hi> Will you haue any more? In few words thus. Anciently <hi>Monks,</hi> some of them were lay-men, some were married, they bound themselues with no vowes, they made no distinction of meats, they laboured with their hands, and liued not in Citties but remote places.

                     <p>This reason differeth not in substance, but only in quotations from the second. Which quotations whether they be true or false, neither will I spend time to search, neither is it any whit materiall. And therefore neither will I vouchsafe it any farther answer, then that which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready I haue given to the second. The best Churches haue seldome beene without their quarrels, and vsually are menaged with two much passion. The malice of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> is the cause of the one, and humane infirmity of the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:23186:325"/>
other. Which infirmity seeing wee cannot altogether put off while we liue here in the flesh, Christian charity would rather pitie it then vpbraid it. Neverthelesse that which is amisse may not be defended: neither meane I to goe about it. Only I perswade my selfe that if wee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood one the other better, our quarrells would never be so vehement. For what was it that set <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inglius</hi> so farre asunder, but misprision? And what cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed such hard censures to passe vpon <hi>Hosiander,</hi> but his owne inconvenient speeches, and other mens mistakings? These are the two principall quarrells here mentioned by you: giue me leaue therefore to shew so much in them, but briefly.</p>
                     <p>The quarrell betweene <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Christs</hi> presence in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> which as you hold to be by way of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> so did <hi>Luther</hi> by way of <hi>Consubstantiation.</hi> Which how it could be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the body of Christ were every where, <hi>Zuinglius</hi> &amp; others could not conceiue, and being pressed therewith, he and his followers not being able to avoid it, maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that also. But how? by reason of the <hi>Hypostaticall v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and coniunction</hi> thereof with the word. For the <hi>Word</hi> being every where, and the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> being no where feuered from it, how can it be, say they, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where? And hence the distraction, and therevpon all those passionate speeches.<note place="margin">Misc. jud. de dissid. caen. dom.</note> Now saith <hi>Zanchy,</hi> if they meane that the body of <hi>Christ</hi> is present according to his personall being, they say true, &amp; contradict not those who speake of his <hi>Naturall being</hi> or being of <hi>Essence.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lib. 3. c. 35. of ch.</note> D. <hi>Field</hi> thus expresseth it. <hi>The humane Nature of Christ hath two kinds of being, the one naturall, the other personall: the first limited &amp; finite, the second infinite &amp; inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehensible.</hi> For
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:23186:326"/>
seeing the nature of man is a created nature and essence, it cannot be but finite: and seeing it hath no <hi>Personall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence</hi> of it owne, but that of the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God</hi> commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to it, which is infinite and without limitation, it cannot be denied to haue an infinite <hi>Subsistence,</hi> &amp; to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in an incomprehensible and illimited sort, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently every where. Thus then the body of <hi>Christ</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his <hi>Naturall being</hi> is contained in one place: but according to his <hi>Personall being,</hi> may rightly be said to be every where. So <hi>Field</hi> whereby you may easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that the warres betwixt hony-bees are not such, but the casting vp of a little dust will soone stint them. For if this distinction had well beene conceiued: this <hi>Vbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitary</hi> strife had quickly beene ended. If any notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing haue beene so grosse as to maintaine an <hi>Vbiquity</hi> according to <hi>Essence</hi> or <hi>Naturall being</hi> (which I can hardly beleeue) I must professe I know no excuse for them.</p>
                     <p>The second quarrell is against <hi>Hosiander,</hi> who seemeth to define <hi>Iustification</hi> by a <hi>transfusion</hi> of the <hi>Essentiall righteousnesse of Christ</hi> into vs, and a <hi>confusion,</hi> as it were, and mixture of it together with vs. And against this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers haue written very vehemently, as justly they might if this were his <hi>Tenet.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Smidelin. Brentius. Others.</note> But there are who defend him, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that it was but out of a mistake. For acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Christ</hi> a threefold Righteousnesse, <hi>Actiue, passiue,</hi> &amp; <hi>Essentiall</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> (for the <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is not <hi>Accidentall,</hi> but his very <hi>Essence</hi>) hee holdeth that we are justified, not only by the <hi>imputation</hi> of the <hi>Actiue</hi> and <hi>Tassiue Righteousnesse</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> vnto vs, but also by the admission of vs vnto the participation of the <hi>Divine nature,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Peter</hi> speaketh, that is of his <hi>Essentiall Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse</hi>:
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:23186:326"/>
to the end that receiuing of his fulnesse, wee might be replenished with all divine qualities and graces. The reason why he so much vrged this doctrine was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had obserued that many out of a perswasion they had to be justified and saved by the merits and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of <hi>Christ</hi> imputed to them, cared not to haue any righteousnesse in themselues, and vtterly neglected the practise of holy duties. Wherefore hee taught that the <hi>Actiue and Passiue Righteousnesse of Christ</hi> imputed, avai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not either to the remission of <hi>sinnes,</hi> or the purchasing of Gods favour, vnlesse they were also made partakers of the <hi>divine nature,</hi> for the avoiding of sinne, and the leading of a holy and vertuous life. This as it seemes was all <hi>Hosiander</hi> held. If he held farther then this, and his adversaries vnderstood him aright, I am no <hi>Patron</hi> for him.</p>
                     <p>The last quarrell is touching our <hi>English</hi> translations of the <hi>Bible.</hi> Wherein that divers things were amisse, it was never denyed of vs. For being an humane act, and humanity being subiect vnto errour, it could not bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided but that some faults what through ignorance, what through negligence, what through other infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, might passe vnheeded and vnobserved. If the former translations had beene faultlesse: the Church of <hi>England</hi> would never haue thought of setting forth a new, as now it hath done. Which it did not, as if those aberrations were so dangerous and prejudiciall vnto the substance of <hi>Faith</hi>: but out of a holy desire that our <hi>English</hi> streames, as neere as may be, might runne with the same purity that is found in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> &amp; <hi>Greeke</hi> fountaines. So that her meaning was not,<note place="margin">Praef. ad lect.</note> as our late learned Translators say, of a bad Translation to make a good (for this had beene
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:23186:327"/>
in a manner to acknowledge that our people hitherto had beene fed rather vpon husks and akornes, then the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of wheat) but to make a good one better, or out of many good ones to make one principall good one, not justly to be excepted against. But tell me in good sooth, you that so busily object vnto vs our quarrels in this point, is your <hi>Vulgar translation,</hi> even that which your <hi>Trent Councell</hi> hath made <hi>authenticall,</hi> and is every where read in your <hi>Churches,</hi> free from errour? Or are there no bickerings and contentions among you concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it? If it be faultlesse, what needed other <hi>translations,</hi> as that of <hi>Pagnine, Vatablus,</hi> and <hi>Arias Montanus?</hi> How cometh it to passe that <hi>Valla, Stapulensis, Erasmus, Vives, Budaeus,</hi> others, finde so great fault with it, wishing it were amended, or another made in roome of it? Nay that <hi>Isidorus Clarius,</hi> a <hi>Spanish Monke</hi> should finde to the number of eight thousand faults, and euery one as hee professeth changing the meaning of the text? Pope <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> the fift did not thinke all was well, when he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to correct the faults thereof with his owne hand. And who would haue thought but all had beene well, when he set it forth so corrected, charging that none should afterwards be published with any <hi>change, additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or detraction of the least particle</hi>? And yet some two or three yeares after this Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the eight finding all not perfectly amended, alters, addes, detracts, yea &amp; contradicts his predecessors edition. For example, where <hi>Sixtus</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Ios. 11.19.</note>

                     <p>The truth is, being demanded the rule of <hi>Faith,</hi> I na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the <hi>Scripture:</hi> and being farther demanded a rule whereby to know the sense of <hi>Scripture,</hi> I answered two things. First that all things necessary to salvation are so expresly and plainly set downe, that there needs no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rule: secondly, that those places which are more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure are to be expounded by those that are more plaine; and that sense which disagreeth is to bee reiected, that which agreeth may safely be admitted. Safely I say: for although haply it may not be the right, yet dangerous it cannot be, as long as it accords with the <hi>Analogy</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi> This I declared somewhat at large in the writing sent to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

So that the answere I gaue you being no other then that wich I had learned of the <hi>Fathers</hi>: you cannot reiect it, but you must reiect the <hi>Fathers</hi> with all. But let vs heare your reason.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Doctrine,</hi> say you, <hi>of Baptisme, of the Eucharist, of Iustification, of Christs two natures are necessary: yet some texts vpon which they are grounded be litigious.</hi> Grant it be so: yet some againe are clear and evident. That <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> are to be baptized, what more plaine then that <hi>Goe teach all nations Baptizing them</hi>? That the <hi>Eucharist</hi> is to be administred and receiued, is clear by the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Saviour, and the practise of his Apostles. That wee are <hi>iustified by Faith</hi> without the workes of the law, wee haue the evident testimony of Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> That <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>God,</hi> the very first words of Saint <hi>Iohns Gospell</hi> testifie,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.1.</note> 
                        <hi>In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and that word was God.</hi> And lastly that hee is <hi>Man</hi> also,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.5.</note> what more expresse then those words of Saint <hi>Paul, There is one God, and one Mediator betweene God &amp; men, the Man Christ Iesus</hi>? If other places be not so plain, they are to be expounded by these or the like. But it may be your <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Baptisme</hi> is the absolute necessity
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:23186:329"/>
thereof vnto salvation. If so, then certainely that place of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> is not cleare enough for it. For it is not necessary it should be vnderstood of <hi>Christian Baptisme,</hi> which was not yet instituted: or it must be meant of those that are <hi>Adulti,</hi> such as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> was to whom our Saviour spake. In like manner if your doctrine of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> be <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> neither is that other place plaine enough for it. For it is manifest both by the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Text, and the testimonie of the Fathers that the Relatiue <hi>This</hi> hath reference to <hi>Bread.</hi> Now <hi>Bread</hi> in proper speech cannot bee <hi>Body,</hi> as your owne men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse. Then is it so <hi>tropically</hi>: and consequently no <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation.</hi> The same doe I say of the errours about <hi>Iustification,</hi> which should particularly haue beene shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if you had quoted any particular place.<note place="margin">Esa. 6.9.</note> As for those <hi>Hereticks,</hi> they were such as the Prophet speaketh of, who in seeing saw, and yet perceaued not, hauing closed their eyes that they might not see. And therefore it is a foule fault in you to excuse their obstinacy, by charging the Scriptures with obscurity. That <hi>Rule</hi> is sufficient which is able to convince the Conscience, and satisfie all those who loue the truth, and are ready to acknowledge it when it is made known: though it stop not the mouths of refractary &amp; stubborne Hereticks. This perhaps your living judge by vertue of fire and fagot may bee able to effect: but the other if evidence of <hi>Scripture</hi> cannot, nor he, nor his Church will ever be able to performe.

                     <p>What you professe you will not doe, that you haue already done. Very weake &amp; wavering haue you shew'd your selfe in forsaking that religion, which is descended vnto vs by succession from Christ and his Apostles, and hath alwaies beene taught and maintained in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church: to embrace a new vpstart <hi>superstition,</hi> vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly vnknowne to the <hi>Primitiue</hi> times, and growne out of the earth, but some two or three nights agoe. What <hi>Motiues</hi> you then had for your revolt, I knowe not: They that knewe you well, speake of some other thing rather then <hi>Conscience.</hi> The best construction I can set vpon it is this, you had beene but badly informed in the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:23186:333"/>
truth. And now least you should incurre the imputation of levitie and inconstancie if you returned to vs againe, I feare you haue obstinately resolved to close your eyes, and not to see the truth how brightly soever it shine vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So that the saying which I thinke I haue some where read in <hi>Tertullian,</hi> is verified vpon you, <hi>Miserable is the case of that man, who was perswaded before hee was instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: and afterward refuseth to be instructed, because hee is perswaded.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The sayings of <hi>Vincentius Lirinensis</hi> and S. <hi>Augustin</hi> we well allow of: but the application of them to your selfe hath more face then forehead in it. For as of old <hi>Dioscorus the Heretike</hi> cryed out in the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon, I am cast out with the Fathers, I defend the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Fathers, I passe not beyond them in any point, and I haue their testimonies not barely but in their very bookes</hi>: even so you, and wish no more modesty nor truth then he, <hi>I follow vniversality, antiquitie, and consent in my Beleefe, I stand to the Faith that hath beene held in all places, in all seasons, by all or the most Bishops, Priests, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors in Christianitie. I follow a Church begun by entrance of nations, authorized by miracles, encreased by charitie, established by continuance, in which is succession from Saint Peters Chaire, and knowne of all by the name Catholike.</hi> But soft good sir, how is all this proued? For you cannot bee ignorant that we deny al these things, affirming the clean contrary, that the <hi>Romish Synagogue</hi> is not the <hi>Church S. August.</hi> speakes of, but altogether degenerated from it: &amp; that the points in difference betwixt vs were neither <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall,</hi> nor <hi>Ancient,</hi> but sprung vp of late, &amp; ever as they rose vp mightily opposed by the most famous Clerks of their times. If you would perswade vs otherwise, you
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:23186:334"/>
may not thinke to prevaile with your strong imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but you must convince vs with sound demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherein God wot, the best of you all are as weake as water. For as for your selfe I cannot but wonder, that knowing no more then you haue picked out of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of two or three sneaking Friers, you yet talke so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently and presumptuously of <hi>Vniversalitie, Antiquity, and consent, in all places and seasons, of all Bishops, Priests, and Doctors</hi>: as if either your selfe had liued all the while to see it with your eyes, or had read all the story of the Church, and whatsoever monuments they haue left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them. If you thinke you may be so bold and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent vpon your Author, tell vs I pray you why we may not be as bold and confident on our? The rather seeing your writers are open maintainers of <hi>Equivocation</hi> and I knowe not what <hi>pious frauds and lies,</hi> which our men e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from their hearts detest &amp; abhorre. But why should either we or you trust so much vnto deceitfull man? The safest course would be with the wise <hi>

                           </gap>ereans</hi> to search the Scriptures whether these things be so or not. He that shall doe this with an honest heart and out of the loue of truth, cannot but finde satisfaction, vnlesse hee fayle that hath promised, <hi>seeke and yee shall finde.</hi> Verily one testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie from the mouth of God, and his sacred word, wil be of more force to settle the Conscience, then ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of those <hi>Topicall</hi> arguments &amp; probabilities, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with your Author gulleth and beguileth you.</p>
                     <p>But where you say that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is by all both friends and enimies knowne and called by the name Catholike, you shew your selfe to be a pleasant and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man. It may bee some of vs at some times may haue called some <hi>Recusants</hi> Catholikes. What then? Doe we
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:23186:334"/>
therefore indeed count you so? Nothing lesse: for wee call you not so in earnest, as if you were so: but only in jest and by way of <hi>Irony,</hi> because you affect to bee called so. Otherwise then thus, wee never either count or call you or your <hi>Church Catholike</hi> Why Should wee, seeing you your selues, howsoever in word you retaine it, yet in effect seeme to disclaime it, calling your selues <hi>Roman Catholikes.</hi> For Catholike is Vniversall, Roman Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: that is of the whole world, this of one Citty. So that Roman Catholike is as much as to say <hi>Particular Vniversall,</hi> that is, Not catholike Catholike. Whence it followeth evidently that while you restraine your Faith to Roman, you vtterly cut it off, and your selfe withall, from being Catholike. Hauing therefore lost the kernell, why are you so greedy of the shell? Of the name I mean, being destitute of the thing? Content your selfe with Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, leaue Catholike vnto vs. For wee are indeed the true Catholikes, holding all that Faith, and only that Faith which the Apostles preached, and was generally beleeued throughout the World. An ancient friend of mine, and a worthy Scholler, being demanded in a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners shop in <hi>Venice,</hi> while there he followed the Lord <hi>Embassadour,</hi> what was the difference betweene vs here in <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>Catholikes,</hi> answered, None at all, for wee count our selues good Catholikes. But the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being loth to be put of so, pressed him againe to know the difference betwixt vs here and them there: and was answered, This, that wee beleeue the Catholike Faith contained in the Creed, but beleeued not the thirteenth <hi>Article</hi> which the <hi>Pope</hi> had added to it. But it being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied that hee knew none such, the <hi>Extravagant</hi> of Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> was brought, where hee defines it <hi>to bee
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:23186:335"/>
altogether of necessity to salvation to euery humane Creature, to bee vnder the Bishop of Rome.</hi> The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe of this thirteenth Article thus patched vnto the rest by your thirteenth <hi>Apostle,</hi> may perhaps make you <hi>Bonifacian</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi>: but the beleefe of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther twelue makes vs I am sure true and perfect <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes.</hi> Whether you allow vs the name or not, it matters nothing: as neither whatsoever nicknames you impose vpon vs. For by the grace of <hi>God</hi> wee are what wee are: and it is neither the one nor the other that can make vs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then wee are. As neither can you by assuming the name of Catholike, or any other Sectaries by calling themselues <hi>Illuminates,</hi> or <hi>Vnspotted Brethren,</hi> make your selues to be that which indeed you are not. For as for <hi>Reformers,</hi> although such Corruptions were crept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church as needed Reformation, and many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men that feared God, earnestly wished and longed for it; yet because it could not be obtained at the hands of those that then swayed in the Church, it is true some <hi>Heroicall spirits</hi> of our side, not without the singer of <hi>God</hi> attempted it, and by <hi>Gods</hi> blessing effected that which the Saints of <hi>God</hi> reioyce to see, and none but Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Idolatrous <hi>Papists</hi> greeue and repine at. Howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it they never tooke vnto themselues the name of <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi> but ascribed the whole worke vnto <hi>God,</hi> and wee blesse his holy name for vsing them as instruments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. In regard whereof I see no reason, why wee hauing reiected and pared off all those errours wherewith you had corrupted the true religion, may not tearme our selues <hi>Reformed Catholikes:</hi> as well as you still retaining them, and resoluing to settle vpon your dreggs, call your selues by the name of <hi>Roman Catholikes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="63" facs="tcp:23186:335"/>But a <hi>Roman Catholike,</hi> you say, you meane to keepe your selfe during life: and it is likely you will doe so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. First to avoide the imputation of inconstancie if you should returne to vs againe: secondly because I see how obstinately you refuse to beleeue whatsoever wee say, though never so strongly proved. You adde that so doing <hi>if otherwise your life hinder not, as you hope it shall not, you shall enioy everlasting life after this.</hi> Wherein I Will not be your Iudge. You are servant vnto another: and for me you shall stand and fall to your owne Master. Only I would advize you not to be too confident. For first, whatsoever your life bee, as I haue said, it is as hard for you to attaine everlasting life in a Church so fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infected with so many pestilent and deadly heresies; as it is for a man to escape with his life in a pest-house. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, adhering vnto the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> &amp; conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your selfe vnto the practise thereof: you must needs make your selfe guilty of horrible idolatries many waies. Whereof vnlesse you timely repent, it cannot be but such a life must needs hinder your salvation. Lastly, although perhaps to many simple people that liue in <hi>Spaine</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> where such meanes of knowledge can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so well be had, it may please <hi>God</hi> to be mercifull and gracious, if they hold the <hi>Foundation</hi> and bee willing to know if they had the meanes: yet I feare much of our <hi>English Recusants,</hi> who liue in the bright sunshine of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> and haue the meanes daily offered vnto them, least their obstinacy in reiecting thereof, and refusing to see, worke vnto them in the end everlasting destruction. Certainly if any of you be saued, it is not by those do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines wherein you differ from vs: but those only which you hold in common with vs. Especially for that when
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:23186:336"/>
you lye vpon your death-beds, and perceiue that shortly you must yeeld an account of all whatsoever you haue done in the flesh: you then thinke it good with all speed to turne <hi>Protestants,</hi> that is, to renounce all your owne works as insufficient to iustify you before <hi>God,</hi> and to put your whole affiance vpon the mercies of <hi>God,</hi> through the merits and obedience of Christ alone both for <hi>Iustification</hi> and <hi>Salvation.</hi> For indeed this is a sure, and a safe way even by the confession of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. <hi>By reason</hi> saith he,<note place="margin">De iustifie. l. 5. c. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>of the vncertainty of our owne righteousnesse, and the danger of vaineglory: it is the safest course to set our whole affiance on the mercy and goodnesse of God alone.</hi> And the like safety doe others of your side yeeld vs in other things also: as namely, in forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make any image of <hi>God,</hi> in worshipping none but the holy <hi>Trinity,</hi> in praying vnto none saue only God in Christ, in the marriage of <hi>Ministers,</hi> and other such things; as it is easy to demonstrate, but that it is now high time to come to a conclusion. Only I would haue you carefully to obserue, that even they who perswade you to stick close vnto the <hi>Popish Faith,</hi> sticke not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to acknowledge the <hi>Protestants Practise</hi> both in life and death to be many waies the more safe. And thus much in Answere vnto this second <hi>Schedule.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It remaineth that I earnestly intreat you in the name of the Lord <hi>Iesus,</hi> and as you tender the everlasting salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your soule, that you would please to bethinke your selfe a little better of your present estate, then heretofore you seeme to haue done. You haue suffered your selfe now a long time to be lead vp and downe in the mist of I know not what generalities: a path which they that loue to deceiue, vse much to tread in. They tell you of <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:23186:336"/>
Antiquity, Succession, Consent,</hi> and the like: and you presently beleeue them. But what security haue you in so doing? for infallible they are not. If they bee mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of so great consequence, it were good you knew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yourselfe, that you need not trust the vncertaine reports of others. Know them your selfe you cannot, vnlesse you acquaint your selfe with all the records of former times, and search into them with much diligence and attention: for otherwise you may herein also soone bee deceiued. But this would proue too long and tedious a course for you: and alas the well is deepe and you haue not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to draw. What then? Surely you haue a shorter way if you would follow it.<note place="margin">Deut. 30 11.12.13.14.</note> For as <hi>Moses</hi> saith, <hi>The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is neither too high for you, nor farre off. You need neither to mount vp into heaven, nor to passe beyond the seas for it. It is very neere vnto you.</hi> For you haue at hand the Scriptures of <hi>God</hi>:<note place="margin">Ioh. 5.39.</note> search them, and therein shall you surely finde eternall life. By them, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> confute all the heresies of their times: vnlesse happily they had to deale with such <hi>Hereticks</hi> as reiected the Scriptures.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.15.16.17.</note> And to this end were they written, that the man of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>God might bee made perfect and wise vnto salvation.</hi> Yea but they are obscure, darke, equivocall, ambiguous, subiect to divers constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and each sect pretendeth to confirme their errours by them. Strange, that they should be the testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our <hi>Father,</hi> and the instrument of contract be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Christ</hi> and his Spouse: and yet they should bee drawne vp so perplexedly and doubtfully, that by them neither can the children certainly know what legacies are bequeathed to them, nor the Spouse what conditions are agreed vpon betwixt her and her husband. But marke
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:23186:337"/>
what farther followeth hereof. For if the Scriptures bee indeed such as you say, then haue not Papists any certain ground at all for their Faith. Yes, will you say, the Church. But shee speaketh not by her selfe, but her he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds and particular messengers: and I would faine know what assurance you can haue that they passe not beyond their commission, or deliuer not some other errant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that they are charged withall. The <hi>Authority</hi> also and <hi>Vnerring power of this Church</hi> had neede to bee most soundly demonstrated. I doubt of it: how can you war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant it? By Scripture? You haue barred your selfe from all hope of succour thence. For it is obscure, equivocall, ambiguous, every way vncertaine. By <hi>Naturall Reason?</hi> The <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> are aboue <hi>Reason</hi>: and the <hi>Naturall Man</hi> is not capable of them. By the Spirit then? That is the thing you so much jest at in others. And if by your doctrine you cannot assure your selfe that you are in the present state of Grace: neither can you know whether you haue the spirit of <hi>God</hi> or no. What then may be your last refuge? The testimony of the <hi>Church</hi> touching her selfe? Ridiculous: for no mans testimony may be admitted in his owne cause. And what a reasoning is this? You be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi>? Why? Because the <hi>Church</hi> bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth you doe so. How followeth this? Because shee cannot erre. And how proue you that? Because she saith shee cannot erre. If this bee not to expose the <hi>Christian</hi> Faith vnto the laughter of <hi>Atheists</hi> and prophane men, I know not what it is. Will you, nill you, when you haue said all you can say, either you must haue no certaine ground at all for your <hi>Faith,</hi> or you must rest vpon the <hi>Scriptures</hi> as the finall resolution thereof. Returne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I beseech in the feare of God, returne vnto the sure
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:23186:337"/>
anchor-hold of your salvation. Abandon those frothie generalities of your seducing authors, which at the best are but coniecturall: and labour to stablish your <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> vpon the testimony of him that will not, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deceiue you. Pray vnto him fervently and proceed in a syncere loue of the truth: and you shall surely finde, that if you be not defectiue to your selfe, <hi>God</hi> will never faile you. For my part I haue done what belongs to mee. I haue planted, I haue watered: it is <hi>God</hi> that must giue the increase. And to his mercy in <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> I commend you.</p>

learned <hi>Hebricians</hi> about this matter: they after their painfull and industrious search into the cited places, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned vnder their hands this answere. <hi>R.

                  <p>But how doth God worke this faith? By his word: For as God is the author and worker of Faith, so God hath appointed a meanes whereby he workes it, and that is his word; which word of God is the only ordinary outward meanes to worke faith. And that word of God is two wayes to be considered: either as revealed by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe (as to <hi>Noah</hi> here) or else, being written by God; is either preached by his Ministers, or read by a mans selfe in want of preaching: and these are all one, and are all meanes ordained of God to worke faith; and that not only to beginne it where it is wanting, but to augment it where it is begunne.</p>
