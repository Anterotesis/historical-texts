            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstandings</hi> are enſlav'd by a principle of <hi>blind Obedience</hi>; ſo far from being led into the wayes of Religion,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53973:3"/>
by the <hi>cords of men,</hi> that they ſeem rather to be driven like Beaſts, and acted like Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, as 'tis phras'd by a late Author.</p>
            <p>As this <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>clearneſs of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> hath prov'd ſucceſsful to the beating down the pretences to an abſolute <hi>Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> and uncontroulable ſoveraignty over the Conſciences of men: ſo on the other hand hath it mightily embolden'd the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons of Liberty,</hi> not only to deſpiſe their Eccleſiaſtical Superiors, to throw off all obedience to Chriſts Miniſters; [Whom He, notwithſtanding, a little before his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his Fathers Court, for the further negotiating, and advancing the affairs of His Church, Anointed and Ordain'd to perform the Apoſtolical Offices, of <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the <hi>Goſpel; Remitting Sins; Inflicting Cenſures</hi>; Miniſterially <hi>conferring the Holy Ghost; Deciding Controverſies,</hi> and <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring the Sacraments</hi> in his ſtead, here on earth till his ſecond coming] but likewiſe to invade their Function, uſurp their Sacred
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53973:4"/>
Calling; eſpecially that part of it which conſiſts in Preaching and Expounding the Word.</p>
            <p>For, ſay they, ſince 'tis confeſs'd, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are ſufficiently clear, to all unprejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced minds, ſuch as are free, from the clogs of Paſſion and Intereſt; Why ſhould theſe pretended <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt</hi> take ſo much upon them? Are not all the <hi>Congregation Holy, and Learned, as well as they</hi>? Are they the only <hi>Temples of the Holy Ghoſt</hi>? And doth the <hi>Spirit of Propheſie reſide</hi> ſolely in their Breaſts?</p>
            <p>During the Diſpenſation of <hi>Moſes,</hi> 'tis confeſs'd, there was a neceſſity of an <hi>Aaron</hi>; all along under the legal oeconomy, the Prieſts Lips did preſerve Knowledge; and likewiſe during the raign of the Prophets, there was an appropriate Miniſtry. But the caſe is quite different under the Goſpel, God having made clearer diſcoveries of himſelf, and poured out more liberally of his Spirit, upon all Fleſh. The ſenſe of the Law that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53973:4"/>
was Doubtful, Typical and Myſterious; the Prophecies were induſtriouſly couch'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der dark Parables, and deliver'd in obſcure ſayings. But then the light, the glorious light of the Goſpel, as 'twas univerſal, 'twas likewiſe ſo clear, that any one who runs may read. Why then ſhould we not aſſert that <hi>Liberty</hi> wherewith Chriſt hath made us free? and ſince we have a Command, to work out our own Salvation, Why ſhould we pin our Faith upon other mens ſleeves?</p>
            <p>Thus theſe men, under the goodly Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, of <hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> become enſlav'd to ſpiritual pride and conceitedneſs; plead the Prerogative of the Goſpel, in prejudice of Chriſts own Embaſſadors; urge, for their own private Conceptions, clearneſs of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to their own Confuſion; and pry ſo long into the Doctrines of Theology, till at length they light on thoſe <hi>hidden Myſteries,</hi> which they being <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlearned</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſtable,</hi> Wreſt, unto their own Deſtruction. The way thus prepar'd, my Text yet leads me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe following Conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:53973:5"/>1. <hi>That the clearneſs of Scripture doth no wayes leſſen the Authority, or take away the Neceſſity of Spiritual Guides.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That though the Scriptures be clear in themſelves, yet private men, abandoning</hi> their <hi>Lawful Guides, and following their own Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Fancies, may deprave and diſtort them to their own Deſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That for preventing Mistakes from ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and ſuppreſſing Errors when riſen, 'tis the duty of Private men to ſubmit their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in matters of Religion, to the Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of thoſe whom God hath constituted to be their Spiritual Guides and Governours; unleſs it manifestly appear, that ſuch Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations are contrary to Gods Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. I begin with the Firſt, <hi>That the Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Scripture,</hi> &amp;c. For, if the Scriptures be ſo Clear, and Self-evident, as is pretended, then may men with greater ſecurity rely on the Directions of their <hi>Guides</hi>; and they have the leſs Reaſon to ſuſpect their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in thoſe things, wherein they themſelves
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53973:5"/>
being Judges, they cannot be miſtaken, if they ſincerely attend them; the clearneſs of the Law is ſo far from leſſening the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that it rather conciliates reverence to the Judge. The Profeſſion of Phyſick doth not therefore become uſeleſs, becauſe the Aphoriſms of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> contain the neceſſary Rules for Health; and may be underſtood by thoſe who are capacitated, and will take the pains to do it.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures they do clearly contain the <hi>Doctrines of Salvation:</hi> And one way, whereby Chriſt prov'd himſelf the true Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, was by anſwering that Character, the Prophets had given of Him, that the Poor ſhould have the Goſpel Preached unto them, <hi>i. e.</hi> Men as of ſmall Capacities, and leſs Eſtates ſo of humble and teachable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions; men who were Poor in Spirit, as well as in Fortune: And the perfection of the <hi>Chriſtian Law</hi> conſiſts in this, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God hath preſcribed a reaſonable ſervice. The Rules of Life, which are therein laid
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53973:6"/>
down, are not ſo much the product of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power, and ſoveraignty; as the Reſult of infinite Mercy and Goodneſs. And theſe His Attributes led Him to conſult the wants, and commiſerate the Neceſſities of the meaneſt of Mankind: And therefore, as when He took upon Him to deliver Man, He did not abhor the Virgins Womb; and that He might become a Sacrifice for Sin, was content to be diſ-array'd of His own E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Glory, to take upon Him the Form of a Servant, and to humble Himſelf to the Death, the ſhameful Death of the Croſs: ſo likewiſe when He took upon Him the Office of a <hi>Teacher,</hi> by a wonderful Condeſcent, He accomodated His <hi>Doctrines</hi> to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, &amp; humane Affections of His Auditors. His Laws obtain'd as much by their ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs to our natures, as the Authority of the Speaker. When He preach'd His <hi>Divine Sermon</hi> to the Multitude, He did not Amuſe them, with Myſtical Theology, or torture their Underſtandings with profound Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53973:6"/>
but as He was the <hi>Brightneſs of His Fathers Glory,</hi> and the <hi>expreſs Image of His Perſon</hi>; ſo He declar'd the Law of God, in a moſt Plain and Perſpicuous manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mahomet</hi> indeed, that grand Impoſtor, was well Advis'd, to Pen his Alcoran in ſwelling Words, and myſtical Phraſes; and as in ſome things to Reſtrain, ſo in others to Indulge the ſenſual Appetite: For by this Stratagem, that ſottiſh People with whom he had to do, were content to part with their natural Right, to gain an Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Freedom, and to Admire what they were never like to Underſtand.</p>
            <p>But our new and perfect <hi>Law giver Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> having no other deſign but the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Souls, and being every way Adorn'd for ſo noble a Purpoſe; though He made the <hi>Gate Narrow,</hi> and the <hi>Path Strait</hi>; yet He hath Promiſed it ſhall be Open'd to all that Knock; and none, unleſs Wilfully, need Miſtake the VVay which leads to Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:53973:7"/>But then, becauſe He knew, there was no <hi>Rule</hi> ſo plain, but it might be <hi>Miſtaken</hi>; no <hi>Precept</hi> ſo clear, but it might be <hi>Perverted</hi>; no <hi>Doctrine</hi> ſo pure, but it might be <hi>Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:</hi> Becauſe He foreſaw there would ariſe falſe Prophets, and falſe Teachers, whoſe buſineſs it would be to Seduce the <hi>Ignorant,</hi> and Debauch the <hi>Credulous</hi>: Becauſe He foreſaw a perpetual Succeſſion of <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> who, in all Ages, would ſet up the <hi>Dagon</hi> of their own laſcivious Fancies, in oppoſition to the <hi>Ark</hi> of His Covenant; and be ſo au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious, as even to confront Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, with carnal reaſoning: therefore to obviate, and prevent, the miſchiefs of ſuch <hi>grievous Wolves</hi>; before He took His Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into his far Country, out of a tender care of that <hi>Flock,</hi> which He had purchas'd with his Blood, He appointed <hi>Overſeers,</hi> and <hi>Pastors</hi> of His <hi>Flock</hi>; committed to them, and them only, the care of <hi>Feeding</hi> his <hi>Flock</hi>; amplified their <hi>Commiſſion</hi> with the like <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> which he had receiv'd from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;

promis'd to be with them unto the End of the World; and to aſſiſt them with that <hi>Spirit,</hi> which ſhould guide them into all Truth.</p>
            <p>If then the Scriptures be ſo Clear, as to be underſtood even by the <hi>Multitude,</hi> then much more by the <hi>Diſciples in general:</hi> If by the Diſciples in general, much more by the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who were His ſpecial Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, and of his Cabinet-Council: If the Nations, to whom theſe Miniſters in Chief, and Plenepotentiaries for Chriſt, made known the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> were through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtructed for the Kingdom of Heaven; then much more both They, and Their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, upon whom they, in obedience to their Maſters Command, conferr'd the ſame Paſtoral power which they had receiv'd from Him.</p>
            <p>The Clearneſs then of Scripture, cannot reaſonably be urg'd, in Prejudice of <hi>Chriſts Miniſters</hi>; for, whatſoever is from hence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, in favour of the <hi>People,</hi> the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53973:8"/>
will be ſtill greater on their ſide. Thus hath God promis'd the Aſſiſtance of his Spirit to all private men, who ſincerely endeavour to find out the Truth; then much leſs will He be wanting to the Governors of his Church, to whom He hath committed the care of the Souls of thoſe private men, and given power even to confer the Holy Ghoſt. Are the Scriptures clear to them, much more to thoſe, whom the Son of God hath ſignaliz'd, and ſet apart for the Lights of the World? <hi>Two Things</hi> are uſually brought to hinder this Procedure: <hi>Either, that thoſe Promiſes of Aſſiſtance were made only to the Apoſtles; or elſe that they depend on the conditioned Righteouſneſs of Men.</hi> Where, by the way, it may be Obſerv'd, that by the Firſt of theſe, the Claim of the People is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly cut off; and by the Second, they have as ſmall Advantage.</p>
            <p>But they who argue thus, might do well to conſider, that this Objection may ſtrike at the very <hi>Foundation of the Faith.</hi> For, if
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53973:8"/>
thoſe promiſes of Aſſiſtance, which Chriſt made to His Church be Hypothecal; if they depend on the Performance of Men, then may the <hi>Foundation Totter,</hi> the <hi>Gates of Hell prevail, Christianity decay,</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel</hi> it ſelf be loſt out of the World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the End thereof, notwithſtanding all Chriſts fair Promiſes to the Contrary. If they had been confin'd only to the Apoſtles, its <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> had not long ſurviv'd the Author; every Martyrdom of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, had pull'd down a Pillar of the Church, and by conſequence, the whole Fabrick muſt have fallen to the ground in the very firſt Century of our Lord.</p>
            <p>Happy indeed had it been for Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that the Imperiouſneſs of ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> had not brought an Odium, though unjuſtly, upon Epiſcopacy in general, that their too much Lording it over the Flock, had not given Advantage to the Enemies of <hi>Church-Authority,</hi> and their Challenging to themſelves at leaſt an

            <p>Happy had it been, if for the Support of their Secular Greatneſs, they had not Wreſted the Scriptures to countenance ſuch <hi>Doctrines,</hi> as have no clear and ſolid foundation therein; and that under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of making the <hi>Church</hi> all Glorious Within, Her Governours all Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Without, they had not defac'd Her Innocent <hi>Beauty,</hi> and made Her <hi>Militant</hi> in the worſt of Senſes.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="1">I.

The Wiſdom of this World, is given in by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> as the prime Cauſe of Hereſie; None were greater Tormentors of the Scriptures than the Phyloſophers; for which Reaſon they are Branded by the ſame Author, with the Title of Arch-Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks: Particularly the <hi>Valentinian Hereſie,</hi> concerning the portentous production of the Gods, comes from the <hi>Platonists; Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconcern'd, and Lazy God,</hi> was firſt ſet up by the <hi>Stoicks</hi>; the mortality of the Soul was the Doctrine of the <hi>Epicureans</hi>; the Impoſſibility of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the Fleſh, of the whole ſtream of Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtles tells us, Not many Mighty, not many Wiſe, not many Noble, were

Choſen: Cautions his Proſelytes againſt Philoſophy and vain Deceit, and concludes the Wiſdom of this World, Fooliſhneſs with God. Wherefore, by <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> Vnlearned, in this place, we are not to underſtand <hi>Ideots,</hi> and thoſe who never knew Letters; but we muſt underſtand thoſe who will not be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by the <hi>Maſters of Divine Wiſdom,</hi> the <hi>Nolentes diſcere,</hi> thoſe who refuſe to hear the <hi>Church of the Living God, which alone is the Pillar and Foundation of Truth.</hi> And ſo their Learning, like <hi>Julians,</hi> only qualifies them, to deride the Doctrines of a Crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God, and by their Wiſdom they become the more formidable Enemies of Chriſt's Kingdom.</p>

Humane Reaſon. <hi>Cedat curioſit as fidei, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria ſaluti,</hi> was the Advice of as great a Wit as any Age hath bred. Our Curioſity muſt give place to our Faith; the thirſt of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Glory, to the benefits of Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, by our Reaſon, we are firſt diſpos'd to be Chriſtians; for no Creature, beneath the Rational, is capable of Divine Revelation; but when once we have given up our Names to Chriſt, 'tis by our Faith we are Saved: but if we Aſſent to no Doctrines, but ſuch as our Reaſon fully Comprehends, this is no longer Faith, but Science; and ſo we may continue Infidells, whilſt we go under the Notion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
            <p>And, ſince We live in ſuch a Knowing Age, wherein all <hi>captivating the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> though it be to the <hi>Obedience of Faith,</hi> is made the ſubject of Grievance and Complaint: And that we have to deal with men of ſuch a ſceptical Genius, as that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53973:13"/>
they do not only enquire into the Grounds and Reaſons of our Faith, but moreover deny our very <hi>Creed</hi>; with whom a <hi>Treatiſe of Humane Reaſon</hi> is of more Force, than the <hi>Revelation of St. John the Divine.</hi> To the Conſideration of theſe Men, I offer <hi>Two Things</hi> which I judge moſt proper.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Firſt, the Anſwer which <hi>Origen</hi> made to <hi>Celſus,</hi> when 'twas objected by that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniator</hi> againſt the Chriſtians, that their Religion was built on a very ſandy Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, which durſt not undergo the Teſt of Reaſon, but commanded its Converts not to Examine, but Believe, and their Faith ſhould Save them. In part he owns the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, but wiſely Retorts it upon his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, by telling him, that the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> were the greateſt <hi>Dictators</hi> in the World: Witneſs the <hi>Ipſe dixit</hi> of <hi>Phythagoras,</hi> that their Syſtems contain'd ſome ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret <hi>Dogmata,</hi> which their Diſciples ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſolely upon the Credit of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. And if the Maſters of the Wiſdom of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53973:13"/>
this World [which is either <hi>Fooliſhneſs,</hi> or at beſt, but <hi>Science, faſly ſo called</hi>] required ſo great ſubmiſſion from their Scholars, how much greater is to be given to thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which are contain'd in the Writings of the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, who were <hi>Taught of God, and ſpake as they were inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Holy Ghoſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Secondly, I urge the Authority of my Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> whoſe, if any, me thinks ſhould be admitted by theſe <hi>Virtuoſi in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>; The Divine Prerogative, ſaith he, extends it ſelf to the Whole Man; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires not only <hi>Obedience</hi> from our Wills, but <hi>Submiſſion</hi> from our Underſtandings. And therefore, as we are bound to Obey the Divine Law, though our Wills reluct never ſo much againſt it; ſo are we obliged to believe whatſoever God hath Reveal'd, though never ſo improbable to our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings: For if we believe no more than what we can demonſtrate to be true, we do not believe the <hi>Truth</hi> deliver'd for the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:53973:14"/>
ſake, but the <hi>Author</hi> for the <hi>Truths</hi> ſake; and ſo we pay no more Reſpect to the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of God, than we do to the Writings of Men, though never ſo much Suſpected by us. The Faith which Juſtified <hi>Abraham,</hi> was converſant in a matter incredible to Reaſon: And therefore, the higher the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Religion</hi> are above our Reaſon, the greater is the exerciſe and tryumph of our Faith, &amp; the Honour done unto God in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving. To conclude this Point, Great is the uſe of <hi>Reaſon</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> both as to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of interpreting the Scriptures, &amp; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing true conſequences, and wholeſome concluſions from thence; and if it be wholly ſuppreſs'd, our Religion will degenerate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Superſtition; we ſhall be ſo far from pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God a <hi>Reaſonable Service,</hi> that we ſhall offer Him the <hi>Sacrifice of Fools.</hi> But then it muſt be kept to a due temper; for, if be not managed by prudent <hi>Guides,</hi> 'tis apt to grow Wild, and Extravagant, to hurry us on to a Belief of the <hi>Fowleſt Impoſtures,</hi> to a Practiſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53973:14"/>
of the <hi>Groſſeſt Impieties,</hi> which either the prevalency of the World, the domineering enmity of the Fleſh, or the implacable malice of Satan, can propound to be Believed or Practis'd.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The ſecond Reaſon of Private Mens falling into Error, is their <hi>Inſtability</hi> in not adhering to their Guides; but forſaking them to go aſtray in the intricate paths of Error and Deceit. Hereſie being nothing elſe but an Exciſion from, and Diſobedience to the Church in points of <hi>Faith.</hi> And therefore the Apoſtle pronounceth an Heretick <hi>Self-Condemned</hi>; one who hath Wantonly cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to himſelf thoſe Opinions: for an Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Defence whereof, after full and plain means of Conviction, he juſtly falls under the Cenſures of the Church, is Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the Aſſembly of the Saints; &amp; ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Repentance</hi> &amp; <hi>Reconciliation</hi> continues in a very dangerous eſtate, if that of <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Publicans</hi> be acknowledg'd ſuch.</p>
            <p>Not in Vain then are thoſe frequent <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:53973:15"/>
againſt Falling Away, thoſe repeated <hi>Admonitions</hi> to Perſeverance, thoſe earneſt <hi>Exhortations</hi> to hold faſt the Profeſſion, and contend for the Faith which was once Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd; thoſe ſo much inculcated <hi>Commands</hi> of Obeying thoſe who are ſet Over us in the Lord, Heb. 13. v. 7. <hi>Remember them which have the Rule over you, who have ſpoken unto you the Word of God, whoſe Faith follow.</hi> Ver. 17. <hi>Obey them that have the Rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves, for they Watch for your Souls.</hi> For in Vain may thoſe men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves to the immediate Aſſiſtance of God, who neglect to hear his <hi>Guides</hi>; and violate His Commandments, in hopes to procure His help &amp; favour: For, from that very moment of time, they ceaſe to be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the <hi>Holy Catholick Church,</hi> they are become <hi>Out-lawries</hi> in a <hi>Goſpel-ſenſe,</hi> they have loſt the <hi>Protection</hi> of the <hi>Heavenly King,</hi> and they lay under the <hi>Deprivation</hi> of the benefits belonging to the Subjects of that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> which is Above.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:53973:15"/>And what wonder, if being in this forlorn condition the Tempter take his advantage, lead them into the Wilderneſs, and there preſent to their diſturb'd fancies falſe ſchemes of Religion, ſuggeſt unworthy apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of God; and whatſoever is by him thus ſuggeſted, is by them miſtaken for new light and holy inſpirations.</p>
            <p>And becauſe this ſpirit of deluſion dares put forth, among Chriſtians, no Doctrines but ſuch as pretend to be founded on the <hi>Scriptures:</hi> to this purpoſe they are <hi>wrested and tortur'd,</hi> their <hi>ſcope</hi> is miſtaken, their <hi>ſenſe</hi> abuſed, their <hi>Periods</hi> miſerably mangled, their whole <hi>deſign</hi> perverted to countenance every <hi>Wild Opinion,</hi> which either a <hi>capricious fancy can imagine,</hi> or a <hi>Malicious Wit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</hi> And from hence it comes to paſs, that we have as many ſeveral ſorts of Chriſtians as there are different humours or Intereſts of men; &amp; the Goſpel with <hi>St. Paul,</hi> though in a quite contrary ſenſe, is become all things unto all men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:53973:16"/>And having made thus bold with the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> it cannot be expected that they ſhould deal more modeſtly with any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity inferior to that; the moſt ancient Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions muſt now give place to new diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries. The Conſent of the Catholick A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick Church be borne down by the <hi>Dictates</hi> of a private, I might ſay, familiar ſpirit. Whereas there is all the reaſon in the World to believe that the Apoſtles beſt knew the mind of their Maſter, that they faithfully &amp; fully communicated their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to their ſucceſſors, &amp; ſo by certain ſteps and degrees we may arrive at this fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal truth. <hi>That as the Church is the moſt faithfull Keeper,</hi> ſo the moſt <hi>authentick Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitor of Scripture.</hi> Which fairly uſhers in my third and laſt Conſideration. <hi>That for the preventing Miſtakes from Riſing, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing Errors when Riſen, 'Tis the duty of Private Men to ſubmit their Judgements, in matters of Religion, to the Determinations of thoſe whom God hath Conſtituted to be their
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53973:16"/>
Spiritual Guides and Governours; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs it manifestly Appear, that ſuch Determinations are contrary to Gods Word.</hi> And this I ſhall aſſert very briefly both from the qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Perſons who are appointed to Rule in the Church, and the Reaſon of the thing.</p>
            <p n="1">I. And that which firſt entitles the <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors</hi> of the Church to a <hi>ſuperiority</hi> over their <hi>Subjects,</hi> is that ſpecial <hi>Ordination and Comiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> which they have receiv'd from Chriſt, to inſtruct the World in all neceſſary Truths, and that Charge which he hath laid upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to obey them. If any one liſteth to ſee their <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> He may find it recorded in any of the four Evangeliſts. I ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit it, as 'tis exemplified 28 <hi>Mat.</hi> 18, 19, 20. Verſes. <hi>And Jeſus came and ſpake unto them, ſaying, All power is given, to me in Heaven, and Earth: Go ye therefore, and Teach all Nations, Teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have Commanded you: And lo, I am with You alwayes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53973:17"/>
to the end of the World.</hi> In the which words there are theſe Three Things conſiderable: 1. That Chriſt commiſſion'd His Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples immediately after He had proclaim'd Himſelf Omnipotent. 2. That this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion implies it to be Chriſts Will, that all Nations of the World ſhould Obey them. 3. That He promiſed to be with Them and their Succeſſors, unto the end of the World. And there cannot be a fuller inſtance, of the Perverſneſs of ſome Men, who to evacuate and overthrow the Authority of the preſent Church, will needs confine <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Which of the Embaſſadors of earthly Potentates ever received ſo ample a commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? the Perſon commiſſioning was Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent. The Commiſſion was univerſal

in reſpect of Perſons, time and place; 'twas directed to all the Nations, and to continue throughout all the Ages of the World, and for the Execution of it they were empowr'd from Above; whereſoever they came, they conſtituted a Spiritual Government, and they had full power to Enact ſuch Laws as they thought tended to the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their <hi>Masters Kingdom</hi>; and they did with <hi>Authority,</hi> and not by way of Counſel only, as ſome would have, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine ſuch Controverſies as aroſe, <hi>It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</hi>

            <p>All along their Spiritual progreſs, if any City refus'd to receive Them, or their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> they ſhook off the Duſt of their Feet againſt it, as a dire Preſage of ſome enſuing Judgment, as the next words mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly declare; <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, it ſhall be more tollerable for</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah <hi>in the day of Judgement, than for that City.</hi> Wretched City! how has thy Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence aſcertain'd, and aggrandiz'd thy Ruine.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53973:18"/>
The Lewd Inhabitants of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah</hi> ſhall find more Favour in the day of Judgement, than thy Citizens. Moſt true it is, their Power was purely Spiritual: Chriſt, the Prince of Peace, did not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion Generals to deſtroy, but ſent forth Apoſtles to Convert the Nations, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring His Laws, &amp; denouncing His Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But then they had no coercive power of the Sword, which God hath given to Magiſtrates, to inflict the Judgments which they denounc'd. But as they, becauſe living under Heathen Powers, left the Event of their Spiritual <hi>Cenſures</hi> ſolely to Divine Vengeance, [which they who eſcap'd in this world, were ſure to meet with in the next]; ſo is it ſtill, unleſs <hi>Kings</hi> are graciouſly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſhew themſelves <hi>Nurſing Fathers to the Church,</hi> to enforce Spiritual Cenſures, by Corporal Penalties, and adjudge thoſe Unworthy the Protection of the Laws of the Realm, who are juſtly depriv'd of the Benefits of the Church. By all which, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53973:18"/>
that the Church is ſomething elſe, than a <hi>Chriſtian Common-wealth,</hi> ſince there was a Church before the Common-wealth became Chriſtian; and neither the <hi>Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> nor any of his Diſciples, hath yet been able to ſhew, how, or when the Church for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited Her antecedent Right: And that though the Governours thereof may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to themſelves a Power diſtinct, yet no wayes Oppoſite to the Civil; The <hi>Shield of Faith,</hi> doth not Claſh with the <hi>Sword of Juſtice.</hi> And maugre the deſignes of thoſe, who have Evil will at <hi>Sion,</hi> this is not to erect <hi>Imperium in imperio,</hi> much leſs to ſet the <hi>Mitre</hi> above the <hi>Crown:</hi> Since whatſoever Power, is here challeng'd as of Divine Right, is purely Spiritual, exercis'd to Spiritual ends and purpoſes; ſo far from interfering with the <hi>Civil,</hi> from Abſolving men from that Obedience, which is indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably due thereunto; that whereſoever it takes place, it abates nothing of that natural Right which the Magiſtrate had in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53973:19"/>
of Religion: Yet herein it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the Wiſdom of the deſpiſed King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> did far ſurmount all the Policies of the world; in that he hath ſo interwoven the concerns of His <hi>Church,</hi> with the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the <hi>State,</hi> that at the ſame time any man ſhall dare to become an <hi>Enemy to his Kingdom,</hi> he muſt ceaſe to be a <hi>Friend to Caeſars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. The reaſonableneſs of this Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, will appear from thoſe promiſes of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, which Chriſt hath made to them, but not to others without them; much leſs to others againſt them: And thoſe are <hi>Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, Direction</hi> and <hi>Power.</hi> Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in things Obſcure; Direction, in things Difficult; Power, to Encounter, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all Oppoſition.</p>
            <p>And this may be one Reaſon, why <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not Arm his Diſciples with a Temporal Sword; for, certainly He, who had all Power given Him in Heaven, and on Earth, might have done it if He had pleas'd, becauſe He furniſh'd
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53973:19"/>
them with ſuch <hi>Extraordinary Virtues,</hi> as did abundantly ſupply the Defect of that. Thus they who could Raiſe the <hi>Dead</hi> from the <hi>Grave,</hi> needed no other Argument to gain the <hi>Living.</hi> They who could convince the Conſciences, captivate the Underſtandings, beat down the Imaginations, and conquer the Affections of their Adverſaries, needed no Sword, nor Spear, nor any of the Bloody Engines of War, to make themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Field.</p>
            <p>Now the ſame <hi>Spirit,</hi> though not in the ſame <hi>Meaſure,</hi> doth ſtill reſide in the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of the <hi>Church</hi>: though they do not equalize the Apoſtles in Working of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, diverſities of Languages, extent of Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; though they have not, as they had, the whole World for their Dioceſs; yet are they ſtill <hi>Biſhops of Souls; Paſtors, and Doctors for the Conſummation of the Saints, for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying of the Body of Chriſt, till we all come in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Faith, unto a perfect man in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Either then let Private men
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53973:20"/>
ſubmit to their Spiritual Governours; exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing their <hi>Commiſſion</hi> according to Gods Word; or elſe let them warrant their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with greater, at leaſt equal Atteſtations of the Divine Favour; and then there will be no great fear, of any danger ariſing from Diſſenting Brethren.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The reaſonableneſs of this Submiſſion will appear, from their ſtudy and learning in Divine Matters, and from the far leſs know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and ordinary capacity in others. The Apoſtles, they had their Knowledge of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things, either from a conſtant and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar converſe with their Maſter, or elſe from that plentiful effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt, which He vouchſav'd them, immediately upon His Reſtauration to His Heavenly Kingdom.</p>
            <p>That which was thus Wonderfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon them, their Succeſſors are forc'd to acquire, by <hi>hard Study, great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, frequent</hi> and <hi>fervent Addreſs</hi> to the <hi>Fountain of Wiſdom.</hi> For, not only the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53973:20"/>
               <hi>Knowledge of Languages,</hi> a <hi>calmneſs of Mind,</hi> neither ruffled with the ſtorms of Paſſion, nor diſtracted with the Cares of the World; but likewiſe a <hi>peircing Judgment,</hi> to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between the Literal and Figurative ſenſe, to weigh the ſcope and coherence of things, to compare one place with another, to Illuſtrate obſcure Texts, by thoſe which are more plain, to conſult, and find out the ſenſe of Antiquity, is required to a right underſtanding of the Scriptures: For, they do not only contain things of themſelves hard to be underſtood; but moreover, thoſe very things are rendred more difficult, by the <hi>Malice of Satan,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Cunning of his Agents.</hi> The Enemy hath ſown ſuch a prodigious quantity of <hi>Tares,</hi> that 'tis very hard ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to find out the <hi>Wheat:</hi> What wonder then, if ſuch a ſpawn of Monſtrous Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons flow from the Scriptures falling either into Prophane hands, or being interpreted by a private, ſelf conceited, and unruly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? If St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was caught up into
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53973:21"/>
the third Heavens, and was even oppreſs'd with <hi>Revelations</hi>; nevertheleſs cryes out, as well for the <hi>Difficulty,</hi> as the <hi>Dignity</hi> of his <hi>Function,</hi> Who is ſufficient for theſe things? Then certainly it can be no Diſparagement to the <hi>Laity,</hi> however quick-ſighted they may be in other Affairs, to ſuppoſe them not ſuch competent Judges here, as thoſe of the Clergy are. And indeed, we hear of very few, though never ſuch Deſpiſers of the dull Clergy in their life-time, but are very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to admit of their adviſe and aſſiſtance when they come to <hi>Dye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. Fourthly and laſtly, the neceſſity of this Submiſſion appears, as 'tis the only means to reſtore Peace and Unity to the Church; Happineſs and Tranquility to the State, how ineffectual the ſeveral Projects of <hi>Comprehenſion, Toleration,</hi> unwarrantable <hi>Complyance</hi> have prov'd to effect the <hi>Work of Coalition:</hi> I mean to Compoſe thoſe <hi>Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,</hi> and unite thoſe <hi>Diviſions</hi> which ſo furiouſly <hi>Rage</hi> among us; we either are, or
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53973:21"/>
'tis to be fear'd, by ſad Experience, may be Taught.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Projects</hi> can only lay claim to an Imaginary Happineſs, and how-ever Plauſible they may ſeem in the Notion, yet may they prove Dangerous in the Practiſe, at leaſt, not attain the ends for which they were deſign'd. For, in truth, as well may we expect <hi>To gather Grapes from Thorns,</hi> or <hi>Figs from Thistles,</hi> as that a <hi>Toleration</hi> of Diſagreements, ſhould produce the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Fruits of Peace and Concord. Theſe are Contraries, and deſtroy each other.</p>
            <p>Now, what other <hi>Expedient</hi> have we left but the Reſtoring, and Aſſerting the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the Church</hi>: That ſo they, who will neither <hi>Hold the Faith, nor keep a good Conſcience, by being deliver'd up to Satan, may Learn, at least, not to Blaſpheme.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and grievous are the Guilts, which are charg'd upon the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; yet, ſuch is the <hi>Exactneſs</hi> of Her <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> and the <hi>Obedience</hi> of <hi>Her Sons</hi> and <hi>Daughters,</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:53973:22"/>
Conſequent upon it, as hath hitherto pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd Her from Ruine. Now, if our Fears of the Increaſe of <hi>Popery,</hi> be as real, as they are pretended, me-thinks it ſhould be no ill Policy to learn Wiſdom from our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries; for that which preſerves a <hi>Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Church</hi> from Falling, in all likely-hood will make a <hi>Pure One</hi> to Flouriſh.</p>
            <p>However, We are little the better for being deliver'd from the <hi>Slaveries</hi> of an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Faith, and Foreign <hi>Superstition,</hi> if we run into <hi>Licenciouſneſs, Infidelity,</hi> and <hi>Irreligion</hi> at Home. For, who is ſo Blind as not to ſee that Irreverence and Diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Clergy,</hi> hath been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed with a Manifeſt <hi>Decay of Piety,</hi> and a Notorious Contempt of the moſt Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Parts of <hi>Religion</hi>? That want of Submiſſion, to the Juſt and Pious <hi>Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of the Church,</hi> no leſs Juſtly and Piouſly ratifyed and eſtabliſhed by the <hi>King and State,</hi> hath given Birth to ſuch a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous. Variety of Opinions, as hath ſcarce
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53973:22"/>
left any Fundamental of the Faith unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd, if not denyed; <hi>Atheiſm</hi> creeping in by Inſenſible Degrees, from indulging too great a Latitude in Matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>And now in the Cloſe of All, Let every Man ſeriouſly conſider with himſelf the <hi>Hainouſneſs and Danger of Schiſm</hi>; and the <hi>Bleſſed Effects</hi> of <hi>Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Danger of Schiſm, in that it breaks the Precious <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Church,</hi> alienates the Affections of the <hi>Members</hi> thereof. Who, as they have but one <hi>Faith,</hi> ſo they ſhould have but one <hi>Soul.</hi> And ſo inſtead of <hi>Love, Joy, Peace, Long-Suffering, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, Meekneſs, Temperance,</hi> thoſe love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fruits of the Spirit, which adorn Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat Men, and ſecure the Publick Peace, There ariſe <hi>Hatred, Variance, Emulation, Wrath, Strife, Evil Surmiſing, Sedition, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, Murders</hi>; thoſe ugly Works of the Fleſh, which diſſolve the Bonds of Society, and exclude Men from the Kingdom of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53973:23"/>
God. How that the <hi>Schiſmatick</hi> is arreſted with Fears and Jealouſies from without, when he conſiders his Sin of Diſobedience againſt thoſe whom the Lord hath ſet over him, and the <hi>Dreadfulneſs</hi> of the Churches Cenſures, when juſtly incur'd, for his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience. How that he is tormented with Sad and Uncomfortable Reflections from within; being <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſtable in all his Ways, ever Learning, but never coming to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth</hi>; but being abandon'd to the <hi>Deluſions</hi> of a <hi>Private Spirit,</hi> He is miſerably toſt'd to and fro with every Wind of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> till at length He makes an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal <hi>Shipwrack</hi> of the <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the contrary, the Bleſſed Effects of <hi>Obedience</hi>; how the Humble Chriſtian, by an happy Reſignation of his Judgment, there where our Lord ſeems to demand it, enjoys a perpetual Peace, and Freedom from Diſpute, together with all his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Members of the ſame <hi>Mystical Body.</hi> As for thoſe great <hi>Myſteries of Godlineſs,</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:53973:23"/>
which concern his Salvation, though they are above his Reaſon, yet not above his Faith; &amp; he had rather Rely on the Churches Deciſions of them, when he finds no place of Scripture, plainly contrary to ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions, than either give way to his own <hi>Curioſity,</hi> or heed to the <hi>Diſputers</hi> of this <hi>World,</hi> leſt He ſhould thereby <hi>wrest them to his own Destruction.</hi> And this He thinks he may do with leſs Trouble to himſelf, and greater Aſſurance of the Truth, and ſo He continues Sound in the Faith, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing skill'd in thoſe unhappy Controverſies, in which the <hi>Diſputers</hi> of this World have involv'd it.</p>
            <p>And this <hi>Harmony</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> is always accompanied with an entire League, and Union of Charity, [that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Badge by which Chriſtians were once diſtinguiſh'd from the reſt of the World] and a Bleſſed <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> of God's Publick Worſhip and Service, whereby the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the <hi>Church Militant,</hi> in ſome ſort
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53973:24"/>
Reſemble the <hi>Saints</hi> of the <hi>Church Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a Word, in this Obedience, the Humble Chriſtian goes on Securely, and Chearfully, in the <hi>Ways of God</hi>'s <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments</hi>; And inſtead of troubling His Head with the <gap reason="foreign">
