            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </list>
            <p>Whereas the truth is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Concerning the firſt, That although Active Obedience binds onely in the Lord, yet abſolute ſubjection is due without any reſiſtance for the Lords ſake, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="2">2.

And therefore by my authority may lay injunctions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Subjects, and they are obliged to Active Obedience, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they can produce a negative Act of Parliament out of the high Court of Heaven; for Princes are not onely inſtead of God by repreſentation <hi>(Exodus</hi> 4. 16.) but they have the power of God over thoſe to whom they have commiſſion <hi>(Exod.</hi> 7. 1.) I have made thee <hi>Pharoahs</hi> God, yea and put caſe the Subject could produce a contradictory command of God to that of his King, yet is not his paſſive obedience diſpenſed withall, nor any part of his abſolute ſubjection diſſolved or cancelled, But wee muſt needes be Subject, (at leaſt by ſuffering if not by doing) in <note place="margin">Ambroſ.

3. But then in the next place it remains to be reſolved by what meanes, or in what manner this ſubjection is to be expreſſed, which muſt be by theſe ſeven meanes following; where there are not <hi>Iura Regni</hi> by mutuall conſent of Prince and people to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſede them, or diſpence with any of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt by praying for them (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1. 10. 4.) I exhort therefore that firſt of all, Supplications, Prayers, Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and giving of thankes, be made for all men, for Kings and all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſſe and honeſty, for this is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour, who wil have all men to be ſaved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. Where obſerve we muſt pray, 1. To the end that we may live godly and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, when we did not live ſo before: 2. That they may come to the knowledg of the truth, when they knew it not before: 3. And that they may be ſaved, when they were not in that ſtate before. None ſo bad then, to and for whom we are not to expreſſe our ſubjection by this duty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, we muſt ſpeake no evill of them; <hi>(Exod.</hi> 22. 28.) <note place="margin">Li. Tit. 3. 1, 2.

            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, we muſt not diſpute their Commands, for where the word of a King is, there is power, and who may ſay unto him, what doeſt thou? <hi>(Eccleſ. 8. 4.) (i. e.)</hi> Not publikely and illegally to raiſe oppoſition againſt him, onely we may privately informe our own judgement, to prepare as peaceably either for active obedience or for Martyrdome.</p>
            <p n="4">4.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:39651:11"/>
without any reſiſtance; for thoſe things which we dare not do when they command them, becauſe they appeare (not ſeem) to be directly againſt God, (as hath been before demonſtrated;) imitating S. <hi>Chryſoſtome, (Epiſt. ad Cyriacum) Cum à civitate fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garer, dicebam intra meipſum, ſi quidem vult Regina me exulem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere, agat in exilium; Domini eſt Terra &amp; plenitudo ejus; &amp; ſi vult ſecare, ſecet; idem paſſus eſt Iſaias, &amp;c.

            <p>Seaventhly, we muſt expreſſe our ſubjection by guarding of the Princes perſon, fighting for him upon occaſion, and ſparing him from going out with us to battell, leſt he ſhould quench the <note place="margin">2 Sam. 8. 11, 12.
