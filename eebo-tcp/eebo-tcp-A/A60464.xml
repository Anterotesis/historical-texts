            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout 5 years since being informed by several Gentlemen Commissioners of the Navy, and others, that His Majesty having taken into consideration the great Wasts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of all Woods and Timber in <hi>England,</hi> especially in His own Forrests; was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not only to Preserve those young Trees which were left standing, but to Plant others for a future supply; and, being desired by some of the foresaid Gentlemen my Acquaintance, to give them an Account what I might Judge would be the Charges to Plant a Thousand Acres of Land with Seed and Sets of Oak, Ash, Beech and Elme, at 5 distances, as from one Foot to 4 Perches, together with the Manner and Way of Planting I should most approve of; in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their Commands I set about the following Work, my intent at the first writing was, not to have exceeded half a score sheets of Paper; and when I had communicated my Thoughts to the Persons who Imploy'd me, to have laid them by for my own, or the use of any of my Friends who should undertake such a Design: but, I know not how one sheet produc'd another, and at length my Book has sweld to the Bulk you find it; for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that it is such a Piece of Husbandry that I have much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in, and endevoured to know above 30 years, and, to effect the same, have made many Experiments throughout this
<pb facs="tcp:64535:4"/>
Kingdom, and in other parts (particularly in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly kept three Ploughs of my own, till the Rebellion about 26 years since forc't me thence.) When I was once enter'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my Commission, I took into Consideration all those sorts of Under-Woods that are most proper, and most in use, as to present advantage; and, I did it the rather, because I had Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc't they might conveniently be planted among the Timber-Trees, till they grow to some considerable bigness, what other Improvements thou shalt find, take it as thrown into the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>I might have spoken here concerning the Firr-Tree, useful for Masts &amp; Yards of Ships, &amp;c. but I fear the Clime partly, and partly the Soyle in <hi>England</hi> will not agree with it; For, although those kind of Trees will live where the Crust or good Earth is but shallow, and of reasonable depth, as the Beech does, yet if they find a deeper Crust they will thrive much better; Onely this in the General concerning the Firr, if they like the Earth, where they shall be Planted, and grow, as in the more Northern parts, an acre planted with them, at about 30 years end or growth may be worth 140 pounds; but, it was neither my business, nor much in my mind to Treat of this kind of Timber, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as I omitted it in my Book, I forbear any further mention of it in this place.</p>
            <p>In the Fifth Book I have taken occasion to Treat of Planting 200 Acres of Land, as well for pleasure as profit; and though part of that Discourse may cause Merryment in some, yet with the Pleasure I have intermingled many good Rules and Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, and I am so well satisfied with the Method I have Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in that and the other Books, that if any Person of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour should so imploy me, being unable by reason of the great Losses I have sustained, to put my own Rules in Practice for my self, I doubt not but I should answer his utmost Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>If it be Objected, That this is a Subject which has been handled by several, and that so it is impossible but I must, if I do well tread in their Steps: I can safely answer for my self, and the main of my Discourse, that it is wholly New, and such as
<pb facs="tcp:64535:4"/>
never before appeared in Print, both as to the Manner, Charges, and Advantage of Planting either one, or a thousand Acres, in the way, and at the Distances propounded: I confess I am but a bad Writer, and have been all my time more experienc'd in the Practice, then the Theory of this kind of Husbandry; yet, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more consulted the Publick then my self, I hope the Learned will indulge me, and so I deliver things as they ought, pardon the Rudeness of my words and expression.</p>

You have also here in Passage shewn the great use of Ships, how they are the Strength of a Kingdom or People, and the chief Instruments of Trade. And this part lastly is concluded with a short Declaration of the wofull wasts and decay of all Woods and Timber in <hi>England,</hi> especially in his Majesties Forrests, not only during the Troubles, but to this very day: Together with some short Proposals for preserving those Trees that are now standing and growing, planting wast Lands for a future supply, and several ways of improving Barren Lands.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>HAving not long since in obedience unto his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties <hi>Gracious</hi> Declaration for the Fishing-Trade of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> discoursed something of Trade in general, and how it hath flourished; together with its Decay throughout <hi>Europe,</hi> as well as here in <hi>England,</hi> and particularly of the Fishing-Trade,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64535:8"/>
and the great advantage that might accrue to this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereby; I think it needless to repeat here what I have other where more largely set down: It is well known that Trade is the Life of all the habitable World, and that by the extent thereof the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Genoese</hi> did engross the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of the Wealth of <hi>Europe,</hi> and by their Shipping, which continually supplyed them with Men, became a Terror unto all about them: But when their Trading decayed, their Strength and Glory did with it fall; as if those two Twins, who were happily born together, were unwilling to survive each other. After the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Genoese,</hi> the Easterlings or Haunse Towns being Masters of the Trade, were very powerfull at Sea and Land, and in their own Bottoms trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported our Staple Commodities all over <hi>Europe,</hi> when we for want of Ships could only look on and see them grow rich by our encrease. I need not tell how also by their Shipping the <hi>Saxons, Danes,</hi> and <hi>Normans</hi> invaded <hi>England,</hi> being the more powerfull, because Masters of a great Trade; but when that began to fail, their Strength and Shipping sensibly decayed. After the Easterlings, the <hi>Portugals</hi> discovering the way to the <hi>Indies</hi> by the <hi>Cape of good hope,</hi> quickly became Ingrossers of the whole Trade thither, and at once undermined the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and all the Haunse Towns; and encreasing with the strength of <hi>Spain,</hi> became as formidable at home by Land, as they were abroad at Sea: But now in these years, those great Trades are fallen betwixt Us and the <hi>Hollander,</hi> only the <hi>Hollander</hi> by art and industry hath better improved his Interest, and made himself rich by our Staple Commodities; For the Original of all their Trade and Merchandise, together with the great support of it, was and is from the Fish they take in the Seas belonging unto <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotlandm,</hi> with the Product whereof, they are grown to that greatness that now they are; and may be as ill Neighbours to <hi>England</hi> as the Easterlings were. Now although there have been many that by way of Argument and for discourse sake, would goe about
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64535:8"/>
to prove that the Seas are free and Common, and ought not to be bounded by any other Laws than their own Shoars and Sands; yet the necessity of Order in Mutual Commerce, and the safety of Mens Goods and Lives, may teach us by the very light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that Laws are as necessary for the government and preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such as frequent the Seas, as of those that trade on the firm Land: And though there be such Persons that dare presume thus to dispose of, and at their pleasure dispossess his Majesty of this his undoubted Birthright, the Royalties of the Seas, which his Ancestors have held beyond all memory; yet I hope he will never be unprovided of others to vindicate, as much as in them lies, by their Lives as well as their Pens, that Right of his Crown, and maintain those ancient Laws and Customs of his Kingdoms, unto which all foreign Princes and Nations have freely submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as by several Records yet to be seen in the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London</hi> will evidently appear: And because it is the general disposition of Men, to choose rather to i emain in ignorance than to be at charges, or by labour and industry to search and find out the truth of things; to inform such as are willing at least at anothers cost not to be ignorant, and strengthen the knowing, they being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and very copious; I shall here only give you a Breviat of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them as may suffice for this occasion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is to be seen a Record therefore in the Rolls there Concerning Taxes and Tributes, imposed upon Ships passing and Fishing upon our Coasts; the Ordinance was made in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond yeare of Richard the second, by the assent of Parliament.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And to like purpose, is that of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, where it is manifestly exprest, that the King appointed Waf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to guard the Fishers, not only of his own Realm, but Forrainers and Strangers that Fish upon his Coasts; and that the Wafters tooke a Ratable proportion of Every Ship towards their Cost and Expences securing their Fishing; and that these Wafters were to Prohibit all other Wafters what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, that presumed to take the Office upon them, and to Commit them to Prison.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:64535:9"/>3. <hi>Cambden</hi> in his description of the North Riding of <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> sayth that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> in their Fishing for Herrings upon the North Coast of <hi>England,</hi> did first obtain Licence from <hi>Scarbrough</hi> Castle.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And all Neighbour Princes upon any such occasion have obteined Licence for their Subjects to Fish in our Seas, as in a Truce of War, agreed between <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th and the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Also during a Treaty between <hi>Henry</hi> the 6th and the <hi>Duchess</hi> of <hi>Burgundy</hi>; those of <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> had Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of free Fishing granted them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And so it was in a another Truce, between the said King and the Duchess of <hi>Burgundy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. The like we find in a Truce between <hi>Edward</hi> the 4th and <hi>Francis</hi> Duke of <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Phillip</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> in the first year of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> Obtained Licence for his subjects to Fish upon the North Coasts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> for the terme of 21 Years, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the same yearly 1000 pounds: which was according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought into the Exchequer of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and received by Sir <hi>Henry Fitton</hi> the then Treasurer there.</p>
            <p n="9">9. And the King of <hi>France,</hi> as others of his Predecessors, by speciall Licence only of the King of <hi>England,</hi> Fisheth upon our Coasts near <hi>Rye,</hi> with a sett and Limited Number of small Boats, and that only for Provision for his own Houshould.</p>
            <p n="10">10. All States and Princes, doe generally give Laws to pass and fish in the Seas Coasting upon their own Territories, and also Impose Taxes and Tributes for their own Profit and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The Emperour of <hi>Russia</hi> compelleth all Fishermen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Seas, though it be many Leagues from the Maine, to pay him Tribute.</p>
            <p n="12">12. In the Seas and Islands under the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> they pay Taxes to him.</p>
            <p n="13">
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:64535:9"/>13. The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> at his Wardhouse in the sound, hath for every Licence a Doller, and for the Seale and Rose, a Noble of every Ship, and for every Last of Herrings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 12. Barrels, a Doller.</p>
            <p n="14">14. The Duke of <hi>Medina Sidonia</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> hath his greatest Revenues out of the Taxes lay'd on Fishermen.</p>
            <p n="15">15. All Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> bordering upon the Seas, Receive a proportion of like benifit.</p>
            <p n="16">16. And the <hi>Hollanders</hi> themselves Impose Taxes on the Fish taken by their Fishermen in our Seas.</p>
            <p>But I shall keep my self neare home, and within the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty of our own Seas, which our Antient Monarchs of <hi>Britain,</hi> even from the first Memory that we can have of them, were always most carefull to preserve; for First, the Antient <hi>Britains</hi> admitted very few or no strangers at all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Service at Sea, least turning Renegadoes, they might upon occasion lay them open to the Incursions of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours the <hi>Gaules,</hi> by discovering to them the manner of their Shipping, which they kept as a very great secret: and therefore when <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> came with an intention first of all to invade this Island; <hi>Gaul,</hi> though very near and in sight of it, could not supply him with any that could give him a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Intelligence of the Place, or which way, unless in Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of his own, or a few passage Boats used by Traders to get thether: But these were Countermanded by a great Strength at Sea, which the <hi>Britains</hi> were Masters of; Shipps of a good Bulk, and serviceable in that Age for fight; which they continually employed to Round the Island and scoure the seas, which course the <hi>Romans,</hi> after they once came to be set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Isle, put in practice, and after something a better me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod; finding here such Timber as they could not be provided with for that use in any other part of their Empire.</p>
            <p>After the <hi>Romans; Edgar</hi> King of the <hi>Saxons</hi> continually kept in readiness a Navy of 400 Ships, which being divided into 4 severall fleets, did every year after Easter, take their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64535:10"/>
Course to the 4 quarters of England, where they remained to Guard and scower the Seas, until the Winter following.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Edgar,</hi> then <hi>Etheldred,</hi> for defence of the <hi>British</hi> Seas and Kingdom, caused of every 310 hides of Land a Ship to be built; which all meeting at <hi>Sandwich</hi> made the greatest Navy that ever this Kingdom set forth to Sea.</p>
            <p>After him, <hi>Canutus</hi> the <hi>Dane</hi> Maintained a mighty Fleet of Ships, for the safety of the Seas and Kingdome; and so the succeeding Kings to <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror: I might instance in severall of our Kings of later Ages, who to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Rights and Priviledges of the Seas, have set forth Mighty Fleets, and by force kept off the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations, till they by the increase of their Shipping have grown to that greatness both in Riches and strength, that they think they may doe any thing, and for some time have usurpt that right which undoubtedly belongs to his Sacred Majesty.</p>
            <p>I might here enter upon the praise of the great use of Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and the farr greater advantage that comes to a Nation thereby, of what importance it is to any People, both for encrease of their Riches and Wealth, Maintainance of their Peace and to make them formidable to those that are round about them: But I shall forbear, only thus much, it cannot but be infinitely more to us of this Island, then to any other Nation in <hi>Europe</hi>; Nature haveing given us the Sea for our bounds, which we can neither Pass nor Defend, but by the Convenience of Shipping; Adding to this the great love his Majesty hath to Navigation, and his promoting all kind of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry that may conduce to the securing of this Nation from all assaults that way, there is none of his Loyall Subjects but think themselves bound, as much as their Talent and Capacity will amount to, some one way, some another, to advance so Noble a Design. For my own part, till an opportunitie offers of serving his Majesty upon that Element abroad, I shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour what lies in my power for preparing something in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to it upon the Land at home; and shall hence take the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64535:10"/>
occasion to Discourse of that great foundation of all Shipping; Tymber, chiefly the Oak: None therefore can be ignorant of the great Wasts committed in this Nation, of all sorts of Timber and especially of this, which in the space of 100 years, but much more within these 30 years; so that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Forrests, that have most abounded with the best Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials in the World for Shipping, are very much impoverished and Decayed: Partly therefore upon the Reasons before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, as a good Subject, and partly out of my duty, having had Imployment as a sworn Officer in one of his Majesties Forrests, and at present dwelling on the Borders thereof, and thereby better able to see and judge the Wasts that have been Committed: In Order to the preserving and increasing of this so necessary a Materiall, I Humbly Propose;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That there be speciall care taken for the Preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all such Timber as shall yet be found standing and Growing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That there be provision made for the Planting of young Timber Trees, in such wast places of the Kingdom as are capable to produce them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That no Person, whether of the Nobility or private Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, be permitted to Cut down, Grub or stock up any Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Trees or Woods of Timber under full growth, or at the growth of 9 foot in the girt or Compass which is 3 foot <hi>Diameter</hi>; For in the Parish where I dwell, there hath been 5 several falls of Timber Trees, the most of them Oaks, sould by private Gentlemen within this 7 years, whereof the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test grown Oak was not above 12 Inches at the Lower or Butt End, if hewed by square, but the most part of them not above 8.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That all Owners of Woods be injoyned at the time and season of their Cutting or felling the Under Woods, to leave standing and growing 20 of the best thriving young Trees, in each or every acre of Wood so cut or felled, if there be not so many already standing and Growing at the time
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64535:11"/>
of Cutting, and those to be preserved until they be of growth as aforesaid; for all Woods have Univesally Received a Mortal Blow within the space of 30 years, notwithstanding there is a statute for the Preservation and Maintainance of the same, Made the 35 <hi>Henry</hi> 8, and the 1. <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> That at every fall of Timber there should be 12 storers or standils left and growing upon an acre or every acre of Land so felled; Now if the King and Kingdom were so sensible of the want of Timber in those daies, being 116 years since; much more may we now; therefore it is a thing to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and of great Concernment, for the abuses of Woods are Infinite and intollerable, notwithstanding the words of the Statute: Indeed I have seen in many places at the falls, where they have lest the number of Standils and more; But instead of them, have cut down those that were Reserved before; and at the next fall, even they escaped not, only a new race of young standils were left againe in their steads, to answer the bare word of the Statute, and not the true meaning of it, which by this shift is very much abused; therefore if Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be not made to prevent that, and to put the true inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Statute in more force, there can be no encrease of Timber trees expected.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Sith Timber and timber Trees by due observation are found to decay very fast, it behoveth every good husband not only to Maintain and preserve such trees as remain, and so by the Statute to be set out, but voluntarily to Plant more, and because there is such a universal inclination to hurle down, it were expedient, that since Wit and Providence will not, Authority should Constrain some men, as well Lords as Tenants, to Plant, set or sowe, with Acorns, Ashen-keyes, Beechmast <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For every hundred Acres of Land one acre: Or to Plant the said Acre with sets or Plants, and to preserve and keep the same until they come to full growth as aforesaid; Now although in former Ages, when <hi>England</hi> was overgrowne with Woods; The Felling, Grubbing, of Stoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64535:11"/>
up of Trees did prove a great benefit to the Nation, by making room for Men, Corn, and Cattle; Yet moderation is now more necessary, for the too much overthrowing of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-trees, and stocking up Woods, hath brought a great scarcity of that Necessary Commodity; and if for the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greedy use and advantage, though but small at the present, there be no regard of future occasions, there will follow Extream want, for there are many necessaries which without Fireing are of little use, and Corn will require Mils to grinde, if all were Meddow and Pasture the Life of Cattle, then A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Land the Life of Men were dead; when for one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities sake, another is abandon'd by some private men, less expedient for the Publick Weale, it must of Necessity be destructive, and much it is to be lamented that the Devas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Woods, threatens a grievous weakening to this Kingdome; such a pestilent heat, issueth out of the many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and furnaces for the making of Iron, as hath Devoured many Famous Woods, and by credible report there hath been lately in <hi>Sussex</hi> above 130. Hammers and Furnaces for Iron, the hammers and furnaces spending each of them in every 24. hours three or 4 loade of Charcole more or less, which in a yeare, amounteth unto an infinite quantitie, but because for lack of Water in the summer to blow their Bellowes all of them cannot worke the whole year, we cannot give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count so Exactly, yet a probable Estimate we may make how many load of Coale, all the said Hammers and Furnaces may expend in one yeare: and to that end We shall suppose, that one time with another they may all worke two third parts of the year, which is 243 Dayes 8 howrs: Each day containing 24 hours or day and Night; and because all Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers and furnaces spend not a like quantity of Coale, we shall therefore take or compute the least or smallest Number for all, which is 3 loade of Coale in 24 houres for each fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace and Hammer; Then there is spent in the 243 Dayes 8 houres: 1460 Load by one furnace and Hammer, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64535:12"/>
unto for the 130 Hammers and furnaces, 94900 Load in one yeare; Now if there were so many loade spent in one County, it is an unknown quantity that hath been spent throughout <hi>England</hi>; and besides this great Consumption of Wood in making Iron, there have been many Glasse-houses which were likewise great spenders, so that if there be not a restraint layd on all Hammers and furnaces to provide o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fireing, and not Wood or Charcole, <hi>England</hi> will soone find a wofull want of that Commoditie, and be sensible of that great Evill, wilfull Waste, without any care taken either to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve or Maintain a stock of Wood by new Planting; for there are too too many that except against Planting, Objecting that it will prejudice the poor, by Diminishing Corne and Cattle: to which is answered, that the greatest part of Woodland now in <hi>England,</hi> is overgrowne with Dwarfe trees, shrubs, Bushes and such like Incombrances which are of small benefit, either to the Poore or Rich, Corne or Cattle; of which Woods if there were but a third part cleansed or cleared by grubbing or stocking up those incumbrances, and good Plants planted for Timber Trees and Woods for fireing, one Acre of the said Wood-Land would produce more Timber to the worth of it, and Wood for fireing then 10 Acres of the said Land doth at present; and then if the other 2 thirds be likewise Cleared, the Land will breed and feed 5 times as many Cattle as now it doth; How then are the Poore hindred or Impoverished; but Secondly, if the one half of all Meadow, Pasture, and Arable Lands now in use and Tillage throughout <hi>England,</hi> were Improved by good Husbandry, Watering, Draining, Dunging, Marling, Liming, Sanding, Devonshiring and such like helpes; (Also by considering the Constitution of the Ground, Whether best for Meadow, Pasture, or Plow, and what Corne or Graine will best Thrive in such and such grounds; for that there is a naturall affinity or Enmity between graines and ground, Experience doth teach; where there is a Mutuall agreement between Seed and ground the Increase hath been
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64535:12"/>
an hundred for one; and on the contrary scarcely the seed again that was sowed, although the Land may be in strength; Also considering the Clime wherein the Land lyeth, thereby to order your Husbandry Early or late in the year.) This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, the one half of the Land in <hi>England</hi> as was said before, will produce double the quantity of Corne, that the whole which is now in Tillage doth, as also Breed and feed many more Cattle; And Consequently <hi>England</hi> will maintain above Double the Number of People in a better Condition by the encrease of Trading; which will encrease his Majesties Revenues, and be more strength and safety to the Kingdome; for it is the greedy Covetousness of most men, Especially Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, to have much Land in their Occupation, when they cannot well manure the fourth part, but wear out the strength and Heart thereof with the Sythe and Plow; for Meadow Land will require soyling or Dunging as well as Arable; Now if Land that have been improved as Arable, Meadow and Pasture, may be yet improv'd higher, much more may those Lands that were never improved, admit of it; which are many waste Lands in Common throughout <hi>England:</hi> We shall instance in one County for all; which is that of <hi>Surrey</hi>; wherein there are many Thousand Acres of Land, overgrown with Shrubs, Bushes, Heath, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>urs, Goss, Whinnes, and such like, All which if they were st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ckt up, the Land Hackt and burnt in the place, and the ashes well spread all over the ground, every Acre of Land thus husbanded would be worth 10. Acres as it now is; But because there are severall hundred families of Poor People that have a livelyhood therefrom, it is my great Designe, That they should have the chief benefit by this Improvement: We shall speak more particularly to the several parts as followeth: The Land being thus Cleansed by Devonshiring as is before explained; In the second place, all those Lands that lye wet by reason of Inundation of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Land Springs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would be layed dry by Drayning. Thirdly the said Lands that were Drayn'd, and also other Lands,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64535:13"/>
except Arable, would be watered or overflowed again at pleasure, as the Land may require, considering the season of the year, either with water springing or running from or out of Rocks or Hills of Chalk, Marle, Allom, or such like Mines, or from hills of arable land; for great Rains will wash down the Dung or soyl therefrom, and much enrich those grounds it runs into. Let no man spare charges according to his abilities in improving his Land; for I have known many men undone by building stately Houses, and others by neglecting their Lands; but did never know or hear of any that was undone by improving his Lands. Fourthly, this performed, we will suppose the fourth part of the whole Land to be one inclosure, and the same plowed and sowed with Corn; and that every poor Borderer that hath right of Common have 4 or 5 Acres more or less, as the said Common doth extend in largeness, and the number of the Poor belonging thereunto; and those Acres to be set out by Mears or Bound-stones. Fifthly, another fourth part to be planted with Seed or Plants for Under-woods, only allowing 7 or 8 Plants in each or every Acre of Land to grow for Timber-trees, or one Acre out of every ten Acres to be planted only with Timber-trees, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing 40 Trees in each Acre; for the Poor must have Houses to dwell in, as well as Bread and Firing. Sixthly, the other two fourth parts, or the one half of the whole Land to be reserved for Meadow and Pasture, and be in Common as the other Lands. This said half being well ordered, will breed and keep twice as many Cattel as the whole Land did before it was improved: And wherein now is the Poor wronged by planting Woods, if Lands were thus improved? for those that have right of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon will have much more Pasture, and provision is made for more Wood. And that there may be a greater improvement of all and every part of the said Lands, my advice is; first that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Land after 2 or 3 years Crops of Corn at the most, be well manured with Dung, Lime, Marle, Chalk, or such like helps; and then plowed and sowed again: Secondly, that the Pasture Land be either Marled or soyled with good Dung, and plowed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64535:13"/>
and sowed with Clover, Treafoil, Centfoil, or some other seed for Grass, and this to be performed presently after the burning of the Earth; for Pasture Land being once in heart will encrease by Cattle feeding thereon: The richer the Land is the more Cattle it will keep; and the greater number of Cattle, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quantity of Soil or Dung comes from them; also the often or much feeding and treading on the land will both sweeten the Grass and destroy the Moss which poor grounds are subject to, and all manner of Weeds: for in green paths that are often trodden, nor Weeds nor Moss grow; and Cattle will feed on such paths or places rather than on any other part of the field; so that there is no better Husbandry to kill Weeds and Moss than to inrich the Land, and keep the Grass short or low by Cattle constantly feeding thereon. Thirdly, that the Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land be planted with the seed or Plants of the Ash-tree, Ches<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut, Hasle-nut, Alder or Withey, because they are the quickest growing plants, and will produce the greatest quantity of wood, good for fireing and other necessary uses, as Hoops Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poles, &amp;c. But where the Land is wet or moorish, and cannot be drayned or layed dry; in those places Alder and Withey are the best thriving Plants or Wood, and in the wettest parts of all, Osiers or Alders: Those Lands that are planted for Timber-trees, as Oak, Ash, Beech, Elme, may be made use of by feeding Cattle, so that they are kept from cropping and rubbing against the trees while they are young; but if the Land be delved or plowed and sowed with Corn, then it must be well soiled with good Dung; for else the Plow will impoverish the Ground and starve the Trees. Now for the carrying on so good and necessary a Work, if the Rich will lend their Purses, and the Poor their utmost labours and industry, God will second all with such an increase, that the monies may be returned again with interest, and the Poor plentifully provided for: And as it is my great request to God that there might not be one Family in <hi>England</hi> want bread, so, if it lay in my power, every foot of land in <hi>England</hi> should be improved that is capable of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64535:14"/>
for one foot square of good land may produce a quarter of a pint of Wheat, which comes to by the Acre, there being 43560 square foot, 170 Bushels 5 quarts: yet he that is ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous will not deny but that there may be a Liquor prepared where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to steep or soke Corn, that it being after set or sown, may bring forth or produce above 100 for one, so likewise Earth may be enriched to produce the like increase; yea, wonderful Crops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond ordinary sence and reason: therefore all hidden benefits must be sought; for ignorance and idleness are alwayes enemies to thrist. And those that are studious in natural causes, know that by the exhalation of the earth, the moistness, richness and fatness of the earth and soil is drawn forth, therefore the careful Husbandman will not spread his Dung in the heat or middle of the Summer, except he cover it with earth by delving or plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Now this richness of the earth or soyl is by the heat of the Sun drawn forth and rarified into air; and by reason of the coldness of the air the same is condensed into water, and becomes Clouds; which said water so condensed is powred down again either into the Seas to refresh and feed the Creatures therein, or on certain Lands; and all this done by the wise Disposer, who in exchange rains down cold, thin and barren waters as a token of his displeasure, or else withholds the Rain; for earth is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but thickned and hardned water; water thickned air, air subtilized water, water liquified earth. But now because these wast lands over-grown with Ling, Heath, Furres, Bushes, Shrubs, and such like, are for the most part poor Clays or Sands; in some places mixed with Gravel, therefore to all those who are resolved to be industrious, and whom it hath pleased God to place upon such barren Earths, my advice is, that after the land is cleansed according to former directions, and also well plowed and hacked: If it be a simple Clay, or mixt with other Earths, and the Clay most predominant, and the Sea be not too far, that they thence fetch good store of the salt Sand, and with it cover their ground, allowing at least 200 Bushels for each or every Acre; after the land is thus sanded, then bestow about
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64535:14"/>
70 Bushels of Lime, or else 100 Cartload of the best and fattest Marle on every Acre so sanded, and putting thereto 50 or 60 Cartload of good Dung likewise to every Acre; then having well spread and mixed these several Manures, that they plow o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the land again, and after it is well hackt with a pair of strong iron Harrows, goe over the ground, tearing that which was plowed and hackt into smaller pieces, which will not only mix the several Manures with the clay, but also raise and increase good store of mould. If the land lie so far remote from the Sea, that to fetch this salt sand will not equal the cost, in such cases they may lay other earth, or the best and richest fresh sand, only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a greater quantity; for of this sand every Acre of land will require at least 100 Cartload; and likewise they must add a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quantity of Lime and Dung, also 100 Cartload of Marle or Chalk. Now the Wheat seed-time being at hand, they must plow up their ground again, and prepare the seed as followeth: Make a strong Brine of Bay-salt and water, put your Wheat therein, the quantity you intend to sow the next day, letting it so lye ten or twelve hours, then drain the brine from it, and having a Tub or Chest or such like, put the said Wheat therein with good store of the best lime, stir and mix them well toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then sow the Wheat thus limed. Now as soon as the Land is sowed, forthwith cover the seed very close by well har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing it, and no doubt with the blessing of God, you will have a plentiful increase, so that one years Crop of Wheat will pay all charges with interest. But if the Land you would improve be a barren sand, then being cleansed, plowed, and hacked as was the clay, you shall lay or bestow 200 Cartload of the best slimy or fattest Marle or Mame on each or every Acre of Land; and if you be near the Sea, then lay 50 or 60 bushel of salt sand on each Acre; for fresh sand availeth little on this kind of land: but if you cannot come by salt sand, then on every Acre of land you may lay 60 or 70 bushels of lime, also 100 Cartload of good chalk: All this being performed, add a good quantity of dung: you need not fear laying too much at the first dressing on poor Land; but if you cannot get any perfect and rich Marle or
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64535:15"/>
Mame, then may you lay a good quantity of rich Clay, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Clay a rich Lome, or which is better, the Earth called Fullers Earth; then plow sow and harrow in the seed as you have been directed, that all the manures may be well mixed. For as in Medicinal compositions, if the ingredients be confused<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cast one upon another without care of mixture, melting or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving, there will be but a corrupt and ill compounded Receipt; so he that dresseth and manureth his ground, and doth not by hacking, plowing and harrowing mix the earth and the soil per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well together, he shall seldom find profit from his seed. Now the causes of the unfruitfulness of barren Clayes are from their cold and binding nature, whereby they stifle and choak any thing that grows within them, and will not give them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to sprout; or if it do, yet the cold presently starves the root, and makes the stem utterly unable to bring forth fruit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the mixture of the sand takes away the toughness and opens the pores of the earth or clay; the lime and salt bring heat, the dung comfort and liberty; so likewise all barren sands are loose and light, therefore their unfruitfulness ariseth from these two causes; First by reason of their porishness or hollowness, and much rain or wet weather washeth quite away or down into the earth, deeper than the roots of the corn and grass, all the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, heat and fatness which should nourish that which groweth therein; and although such Land be well soiled with dung, yet it will not last above one Crop of Corn or two at the most. Secondly, what the Rain leaves, the Sun by his heat draws forth out of the Earth from the roots of Corn and Grass. Now Marle is not only an enemy to all Weeds, but giveth a general virtue to all Corn and Grass, and by its glutinous substance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incorporated with the sand, closes the hollows and porous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness thereof, so that what ever Soyl or Manure be layd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it will last many years, and aboundantly increase that which was planted, set, or sowed therein: And if the said Marle be layed on Meadow or Pasture, the land will be much enriched, and may so continue some hundred years: And as the the Marle
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64535:15"/>
likewise the Clay, Lome, or Fullers earth will worke the like Effect on Arable land, yet not to so good purpose as the Marle; Now although Dung be most proper for Pasture land, yet Marle is of speciall Use and much differs from Dung in one particular, for Dung spends it self upwards, and although it lie deep within the Earth, yet the vertue will Ascend, and if it lie upon the ground in Summer, it will grow light and spungy, whereby the goodness is drawn forth or consumed by the heat of the Sun, but it is the Nature of Marle to work downewardes into the Earth, and it is dissolved only by Frost; therefore the best season to lay it on the Land is about Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmas, that so the Winter following may break and melt all the Stones or Cloats, and being thus broken, the Rain will help to wash the same into the Earth; now although Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally sandy Earth is hott, yet these barren sands by reason of their poverty, are very cold, therefore Lime and Salt are of great use, and to good purpose laid on them and mixed together; wherefore you must not forget to steep all seed except Rye, in brine as before mentioned, but you are to take notice, that Oates will not require or endure so long to lye in steep as the other Grain; Now to give a tast of the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which Labour and industry brings unto such as take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure therein; We shall suppose these barren Earths before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, were not worth above 2 shillings the Acre yearly Rent before they were improved, and the charges of improving may come to twelve pounds the Acre, which is tenn pounds more then the fee simple of the Land is worth; One Crop of Wheat, if God bless the Increase, will sufficiently pay all the charges with Interest; Then likewise may you receive two years crops more of Wheat, and 5 or 6 Crops without intermission eitheir of Rye, Barly, Pease, Beanes, or Oates, and be at no more charges about the Land then once Plowing and Harrowing, seed, salt and lime to steep the seed; Now as salt is a great destroyer of all Weeds, so likewise it is of great strength and vertue, for the bettering all manner of Arable
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64535:16"/>
Land, and a great Nourisher of seed in the Ground, if mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately used, like Blood in the Body of man, which carrieth the vital heat and is in taste salt, as being a nourisher and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer of all the inward faculties; now after 7 or 8 years sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Corne the said Land may be worth aboue twenty shillings the Acre yearly rent to lye for meadow or Pasture.</p>
            <p>To treat of all and every part of Husbandry, Would swell my Book into too great a Volume, which is not my task at this time. I shall therefore return to my intended work, and treat only of Planting Timber Trees.</p>
            <p>Now although it hath been Objected, that the Planting Forrests and other waste Lands will much prejudice the Poore, yet it is well known, that the Rich have the benifit and are great oppressors of Commons by the multitude of Cattle they feed thereon: having Land of their own to keep them in the Winter or when the Commons are eaten bare, and the Poore for want of such Winter Provision have little or no benifit at all, but are many times undon; and thereby accustom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be Idle, and Neglecting their constant labour, steale his Majesties Wood, and spoyle his Timber, by Chipping, Shredding, Lopping and such like, All which Spoyles or Wastes being benificial unto the keepers, are overseen, but not provided against as they should be; yet the Poore are not the greatest offenders, they only break the ice and prepare it for others, who almost every Day before Sun Rise and after Sun set make the sound of many Axes, heard by their Lopping, Chipping, and Committing such like evils: There are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise other Wastes then all these, for whereas there are some thousands of young Oaks and other trees which have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64535:16"/>
another so to bear it company; for to my knowledge about the Month of <hi>October</hi> last 1664; two Dead trees were sould by one of the Keepers of the saide Forrest, to a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour living in the next Parish, and the party that was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to cut downe or fell the said trees, Cutt downe two other Trees which were not dead; And this is no new thing but hath been often done without doubt, though then I feare Especially, when there was a better Opportunity offered by so great a number, as have been lately felled for the use of the Navy and the Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> The same Party that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this fact being one of the chief workemen employed for their felling. Nor may any man think strange, that there should be such spoyles made in those Days; the Officers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted to take care of the said timber being rather Farmers then Keepers, or good Woodmen; Also there hath been but one swaynmote this 40 yeares, nor a Wood Court <hi>to any effect,</hi> and consequently no Presentment these 4 or 5 last yeares, which only then can be made. But to proceed in my proposals.</p>

               <hi>Lastly,</hi> Whereas his Majesties Forrests have formerly flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and abounded with the best timber Trees in <hi>England,</hi> Nay I may safely say, for the Building of Ships the World doth not afford better, especially the Oake; which are now utterly wasted and decayed</p>
            <p>My humble Proposal is: that part of the said Forrests, Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of such as lie within 20 Miles of any Navigable River, and are not so usefull for the Breeding his Majestys Deer, and that have but few Deer, be Planted as aforesaid: I dare not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to Proportion the quantity of Ground to be Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in each Forrest, not knowing his Majesties Pleasure, also some Forrests are larger and of greater extent than others, and doe more abound with timber trees, neither can I speak Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally of all Forrests, but that which is best known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, and wherein I have dayly walked as a Forrest Officer, I will at present discourse a little. That Forrest then the care whereof hath been my employment, doth not containe above
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64535:17"/>
3 Thousand Acres of Ground in the whole, yet it hath so abounded with timber Trees, and that of such excellent good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that it might be compared to any one Forrest in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; but it is now much wasted, and doth more and more dayly decay; for besides the Wastes that have been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted within this 20 years, by reason of the unhappy Wars and Rebellion, there was also felled and cut down <hi>Anno</hi> 1663 above eleven hundred Trees, and but 600 of them employed for the use of his Majesties Navy; and since the time before the trees then felled were removed off the ground, There was in the yeare 1664, a Warrant delivered unto the Regarders of the said forrest, to view and mark all the Decaying Trees, which are some of them accordingly Marked, and by vertue of the said Warrant, most of the Trees in the forrest may be cut down, for they are generally Wasted and decaying but may live and be serviceable an hundred yeares yet to come: and if his Majesties forrest be Stocked with Dear, then the worst of these Decaying Oakes will beare great store of Masts or Acorns, which is good for a Winter Dear, and of my owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Experience, there are many very hollow Oakes that bear greater store or more Acorns to the Number and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Boughes then the soundest tree in the Forrest.</p>
            <p>In the yeare 1665 the Commissioners of the Navy procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red another Warrant from his Majesty for the cutting down 2000 Trees more in the said Forrest to Build and repair his Majesties Shipps, and to effect the same, they sent down a Purveyor to mark and fell the said Trees, which was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly performed; But by severall Reportes of Workemen Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about Cutting down the said Trees; there was not above 15 or 16 hundred of them converted to the uses appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his Majesties Warrant, for severall Gentlemen in the County and not farr dwellers from the Forrest, Bought the Offall of 2000 trees for 750 Pounds, or thereabouts, by which said Offall is to be understood if rightly taken the Bark, and Boughes, and all that part of the tree only which is not used for
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64535:17"/>
Shipping: but making an agreement with them that had power to sell, under the name of Offall were taken in whole trees marked and cutt downe which were not usefull for Building his Majesties Ships, though they might have been easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to have been unserviceable for that end by the survey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our that chose them, or any Man of very indifferent Iudgement, and so left as they ought standing, but these had the ill fortune to be cut downe, to make advantage by their fall, some hundreds of them, whilest many other sufficient Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber trees and most fit for the use aforesaid were left standing and are yet Growing; Neither is this all, for I have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that there were many Trees which were cut to pieces as Offall which had Ship timber in them, and not unlikely, whilest the workmen who were chiefly Imployed about the Offall were known Enemies to his Majesties Woods and timber, and have lived on the spoyle above 20 years: and to my owne Knowledge have been presented some of them for the same; But because there hath been no swainmot Court kept within that time, they have scaped the Lash: these men were also imployed about Cutting down his Majesties trees, and the chief Hewer appoynted by the Perveyor was as honest as the rest, and being so, they had fit opportunities to commit such villanies as are reported, and whereas the Officers as Regarders and Keepers, are sworne to endeavour to prevent all Wastes Committed; the Keepers have been so much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about cutting down trees for their own profit, that they have not had time to look to the preventing the spoyles of others, and therefore care not or dare not accuse others, being them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Guilty, and some of the Regarders also doe more mind to buy Wood and timber for their owne use and Profit, then they doe for his Majesties interest and good of the Kingdome, in preventing Wastes committed, and this is not all the Evil done to his Majesties Woods: for the Borderers dwelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Forrest, taking notice of the Wastes committed by Officers, take boldness to make likewise great spoiles, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64535:18"/>
many of the said Borderers have and do to this Day inclose his Majesties Land, some one or 2 Acres some more some less; In which Inclosures or encroachments are and have been sometimes 2, 3 or 4 Oaks Growing; the said Land so inclosed is fenced with a dead Hedge the first year, and the Bushes within the Plot Grub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed up, and one of the Trees; Also the said Land Delved and sowed with Corn; the next year if no disturbance happen, a Ditch is made about the inclosure, and the Land sowed again with Corn, and another tree stocked up; and so the work goeth on till all the trees are cut down, and in some encroachments fruit trees have been Planted, and other Trees in hedge rowes: as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Houses built of his Majesties Timber as if it were the Occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Inheritance, though but small Plots of Land now, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of what hath been formerly, are taken in by way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chroachment.</p>

               <head>The Argument.</head>
               <p>In this Book is treated the Planting Forest Lands, and other wast Lands, with Plants for Timber-trees; also of all kinds of Earth Simple or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, Rich or Barren; and the manner and way of improving the same, either by planting Seed or Sets for Timber-trees or Vnder-woods; Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise by draining or watering such Lands that require the same: and Devonshiring or Burning those Lands grown over with Bushes, Heath, Furres, Goss, or such like: Also the way of Improving all the said several sorts of Earths by Lime, Marl, Mame, Dung, and many other such like Improvements; likewise by Plowing, Delving, Trenching, or Plow-trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the said Land, and sowing seed for Corn or Grass: and of several Observations and Directions therein.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>NOw considering that his Majesties Timber and Woods standing and growing will not be a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient stock to mantain and keep in repaire the Royal Navy for any long continuance of time to come without a supply by new Planting those wast and vacant places that have no Trees or very few growing, I shall humbly offer my Judgment and Experience in this thing, and will lend my assistance to the utmost of the ability God hath given me for the Planting and thus improving them; And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64535:19"/>
his Majesties forrests and other Wast Lands, do much differ in goodness and largeness, and also some of them are better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished with Timber trees then others: and not knowing his Majesties Pleasure, Either what forrest or part of the forrest or what quantity of Ground shall be Planted, I cannot set down the Proportion, But will suppose a Thousand Acres.</p>
            <p>A skilfull Arborist will make choyc of such a soil, where he may provide a strong and sufficient fence, before he will be at the Charges of Planting; In the first place then is to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, the making the fence about the Plott of Land before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, which was a Thousand Acres; and although there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Figures of Land I shall mention but one; for it is not my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to multiply Words; We will suppose the thousand acres to be a square piece of Ground; The square then of this Plot or parcel of Land is 400 Perch or Pole, Land measure, the Pole or Perch containing 16 foot and a half in length; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there are divers Opinions risen, grounded upon long custom in many places, of the length of a Perch, yet there is but one true Pearch by Statute appoynted for the Measuring Land, which is as before mentioned: but for Wood Measure or hedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diching there is 18 foot allowed to the Pole or Pearch; the Reasons are because Under Woods which are thus Measured for sale, have in many places sundry gals or void places, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in groweth little or no Wood, and to supply these defects the Buyer Claimeth this supply by measure; What to make this fence of, is the next to be considered: and because my great care and indeavours are for the preservation of his Majesties Timber; therefore I would not have one tree cut down or felled for this purpose, although the Paling thereof would be a sufficient fence but not of a very long continuance; all fences therefore commonly are made of Wood, Brick, Stone, or Earth as dry Wals, or Ditches, or Earth compounded, there are other fences as Motes or ditches of Water, where the ground is levell and springy, or the Water brought from some Spring o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> River, but of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according to my Iudgement, the White thorn Hedg is the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64535:19"/>
best; for in 8 or 9 years it will make the best fence both for height<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to succour the young Timber trees or Plants for trees; as also for strength to keep out all Enemies to the said Plants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Planting of this Thorn hedge is so well known to all Husbandmen, that there will not seem to need many words to Demonstrate it, yet because I intend to direct you hereafter to Plant Timber trees the same way, I shall take a little the more paines in it; I shall not use much curiosity in pleasing every mans fancy in the making this fence; as how many Rows of Plants or setting them upright, or slope ways, or flatt, or the distance more or less, but shall give you my particular opinion of it.</p>
            <p>Now to begin the work, the Ground being viewed, Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned and measured, that is to be Planted, We will suppose it as I said before to be a square piece of Land, and to contain a Thousand acres, the square then is 400 Perch; the whole Plot or the 4 squares contain 1600 perch about; which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the fence, but if the fence be measured by Wood, Hedge, or Ditch measure allowing 18 foot to the Perch; then the one angle or square will contain but 366 Perch 12 foot, and the content of the whole fence by the said Wood measure is 1466 Perch 12 foot, the fence must be thus made; First I would advise the Ditch to be 6 foot wide or broad at Top, and 5 foot deep slopewise, so that the breadth at the bottom or low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of the Ditch be but 3 foot or there abouts, according as the ground is stiff and binding, or hollow light and looss, for if it be a light ground, the bank must be more sloping, or else it will founder and fall into the Ditch again, and the repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thereof will be the increase of Charges; In the next place, care is to be had in providing Plants, wherein you may please to take these observations following: First that your Plants be not too great nor too small; for, there are severall opinions concerning both these sizes; The best size according unto my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, is to have them about the bigness of an ordinary Mans little finger; Secondly that you have them drawn or taken out of the Earth but a day or two before the Planting; if with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64535:20"/>
it may Be; the same day is better, for although it is usuall to have Plants gathered a Week or more before they are Planted, yet it is a great Evil and not to be approved of; Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in drawing or taking your Plants out of the Earth, let not the Bark or Roots be broken or bruised, 4ly in trimming or preparing the Plants for Planting, my advice is, to cut off the top of the Plant above 6 inches from the stem of the Root, and let it be cut slope ways with a sharpe Knife clean and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some; but cut not the Roots, except there be a superfluous Root that was broken off from some other Root, or that is bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, broken, or part of it dead, <hi>in such cases you may</hi>; see the Chack or body of the Plant be clean without shoots, And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it hath been and is a custom to cut and trim the Roots, yet it is not to be allowed of, because every cut is a Wound and the more Wounds the greater danger; The Plants being thus Proyned, trimmed and fitted for Planting; after the first Turf layd with the grassy side downwards; and the upper part of the Turf or clod of Earth which was the lower, pared plain, near one third part of the thickness of the Turf, then lay on the Plants in a rank or row <hi>containing in distance (or the distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Plants would be) one foot of ground,</hi> and this Rank or row of Plants <hi>to extend to the end of the Angle or square</hi> and <hi>so of all the Squares.</hi> In the laying of the Plants in the ground, <hi>must</hi> be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served these 3 Rules; First let the Plants be layed slopeing or slope ways that the top or head of the Plant may lye 4 or 5 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches higher than the Root, or the level of the lay of Earth, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly let not the top or head of the Plant lye above 2 Inches out of the Earth, Thirdly let the slope side that was cut lye downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or side ways, that the wounded place may have the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Sun, as also that the Water may not rest upon it, for in Winter, the Water being frozen on the place cut will be a great annoyance unto it; and much Rain often dropping on the wound may penetrate the Pith, and causing hollowness may much endanger them: After the first Rank, Row, or Chess of the Thorn Plants laid or planted as aforesaid, then there must
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64535:20"/>
be of the best earth laid on the roots of the said Plants, to the quantity of 6 or 7 inches deep; then a spadeful or spades depth of such earth as the ditch will afford, or else another turff on the good earth: this being performed, and the ground prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as was formerly directed, then lay another row of Plants of the same distance as the first, yet not over against them, but over against the middle space between the first Plants: Order this second Row of Plants as the first, and because the Bank will be great, there being much earth to be cast out of the ditch, there may be another Row or Chess of Plants laid above the second, over against the middle distance between the second Row, still observing the distance of earth between and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Plants, as you did in the first and the second Rows; then cast or lay some of the best earth the Ditch will afford, as aforesaid, on the roots of this third and last Row: This done, cast up all the earth out of the Ditch on the last earth, making the bank firm by clapping or beating the earth close with the Spade. Upon this bank must be made a dead Hedge, so called because it is made of dead wood, as Bushes or Frith, which is all sorts of small wood that are not Thorns. This Hedge is to shrowd or shelter the young Plants, as also to keep and preserve the Banck from being trodden upon and thrown down by Cattel. Now in planting this and all such like Fences observe this rule; mix not your white Thorn with any other Plant; for although it be and hath been a general Custom in <hi>England,</hi> to have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral sorts of wood growing in Hedge-rows, yet it is my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that they were not so planted at first, but that this Island antiently being for the greatest part overgrown with Woods of all sorts, which of late years have been otherwise improved and converted into Pasture and Tillage: The Improvers, in the making the several Boundaries or Inclosures, troubled not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to do them all anew, of any one kind of stuff, but in their grubbing where they stood convenient for such use, left remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only the stems and roots of trees, but several whole trees young and old, which by their lopping or topping might
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64535:21"/>
serve for necessary Reparations; particularly Hedgeboot and Plowboot when occasion should serve, little valuing the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantialness of their Fences for the future, so they would serve the present necessity; for I did never yet see a sufficient strong Fence of White thorn, which is the best of all if thus planted by it self, where there were trees or any other kind of Plants growing or mixed with them; for trees will not admit of any kind of thorns to grow up with them; and if there be so great an enmity between thorns themselves, that the white and black will not thrive together, as if they naturally bore an antipathy to each other for their colours sake; we shall not so much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if we more sensibly perceive it when they are intermingled with other kinds; and that the white and black thorn do thus disagree, hath been my observation for a long time, in several Hedge-rows where at first they were joyned, but when they came to grow up, the white hath so over-mastered the other, that they have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uite decayed, and leaving a gap in the place where they formely grew, have rendred the Hedge thin, full of bracks and insufficient. Thus have you my Judgment for the making of a good serviceable and profitable Fence; for within 10 or 11 years after the first planting, the thorns will be grown to that height and bigness, that cutting them close near the ground, with part of the offal or stuff may be made a sufficient dead Hedge, as before mentioned, on the bank of the ditch, to shrowd the second growth of the Thorns and Under-woods (it being supposed the young Timber-trees will by that time be grown to the height and greatness, they will not want the Hedge to shelter them.) This first cutting of the thorn Hedge will cause the next growth to come more thick, and make the Fence much more strong than before; the overplus of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal, which will be considerable, may be made into Brush Fagots good for Brewing, Baking, or be sold or used to make or mend other Fences. Now the second cutting of the quick or thorn Hedge aforesaid you may begin sooner than the first, as within 8 or 9 years, if the Quick-sets or Plants do well thrive, which
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64535:21"/>
they will the better do, if you observe these rules following; First, let the Plants be well weeded the first, second and third years after planting; Secondly, observe that they all grow alike, and where they fail plant new plants in the vacant places, which must be done betimes before the other plants grow too big; for in digging or opening the ground to set or put in the new plants, you may cut, break, or bruise the roots of the old, which is hurtful; or the roots of the old, being grown great and entred deep into the ground, will so draw the moisture of the earth to them downwards below the reach of the roots of new younger plants, that they will thereby be in danger to be starved; or by over topping them; besides the keeping away the benefit of the Sun from them they will be subject to drop continually upon their cut or wound, and so quite destroy them: as for the planting of several sorts of wood in Hedg-rows it is only for the benefit of the lops and shreading of the said trees, and regarding not the strength and goodness of the Fence; for although by plashing the boughes of trees, laying them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the hedge, or on the bank of the ditch, Deer and Horse or such like Cattel may be kept from leaping over; yet it is very weak to keep out Swine or smaller Cattel from creeping under; First because those boughes cannot be laid very close, and secondly they have not prickles or thorns, whereby they may be a guard against such an enemy. And whereas it is the opinion of many men, that planting trees in Hedge-rows doth save ground, accounting Hedge-rows wast places; if such men would but seriously consider of these observations following, they would be of another mind; first, the trees planted in Hedg-rows being often shred and lopped cannot live the tenth part of the age of trees other waies planted; secondly they shall not grow to that greatness either in body or boughs, as others do which come much short of them as to the time of their growth; for a tree well planted shall be greater and larger every way in twenty years, than those in Hedge-rows shall be in fifty; Again, consider the uselessness and loss of ground on both sides
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64535:22"/>
of the trees along the Hedg-rows, for so far as the roots and boughs of the trees extend; the ground will not be good either for Corn or Grass; for the Grass, not having the benefit of the Sun, will be sower, and of more use for purging than feeding Cattel; also the roots of the trees, which usually extend as far under ground, as the boughs above will hinder and indanger the Plow; or being great, and growing low into the ground, will not only over-master and oppress the roots of thorns by wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about them, but by sucking and drawing the fatness and moist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the earth which should nourish, utterly starve them; and the boughs by over-topping will not only over-shade them, but with often dropping, as I said before, spoyl both Corn and Hedge. Now if Planters were but sensible of the loss sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by reason of bad Fences, and the small profit of trees so planted (all things considered) they would soon alter their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; to give a reason for every particular observation would take me up too much paper and time; only take this general, of which I have made the experiment, and till any proof appear to the contrary, or more profitable way be found out, my desire is that this may be allowed. Thus have you directions for the planting and making the best Fence: Now the charges cannot be certain by reason Plants are scarcer and dearer in some Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries than others, as also the labour or hire of men; for in some Countries good Plants may be bought for two pence or three pence the hundred which will cost in other places five pence or six pence: also in some Countries a good labouring man will work at hedging or ditching for eight pence or ten pence the Summer day, and in other Countries not under twelve or fourteen pence the day; we shall therefore compute the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges indifferently between the highest and lowest prices, allowing for the Plants four pence the hundred, and for the Labourers twelve pence the day.</p>
            <p>A Pole or Pearch then of Hedge or Ditch measure will take up to plant it well 54 Plants; there being 3 Rows or Chefs of Plants set or planted at a foot distance, and if so, then the one
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64535:22"/>
angle or square of the 1000 acres formerly mentioned contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 400 pearch, will after the same rule require 21603 Plants, which at four pence for each hundred cometh to three pound 12 shillings. The four angles or whole squares will need or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire 86406 Plants, there being six Plants abated for two of the sides or squares, they all at the same rate by the hundred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to fourteen pounds eight shillings. And now for the Charges of the Workman: a good Labouring man may ditch and quick-set about the Spring or fall of the Leaf a ditch of six foot broad and five foot deep; half a pearch in one day, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 18 foot to the Pole or Pearch: A man also may make a good and substantial Hedge sufficiently staked three or four Rod in a day; so that he may cut, carry, or draw the Bushes or Frith for the Hedge, and make the Ditch six foot wide, and five foot deep, being planted with three Rows or Chess of Quickset and a good dead hedge on the Bank, and sufficiently finish the whole work, and pay the charges of the Plants for three shillings the Pole, still supposing the Frith and Bushes to be near at hand, and to be free except cutting and carriage: Then the total charge of making the Fence about the thousand acres at three shillings the Rod, the angles or squares containing 1600 Perch is 240 Pounds besides the Bushes and Frith for Stakes, not doubting but that all his Majesties Forests are well replenished with Bushes and Frith; and that the same will be allowed <hi>gratis</hi> for so good a work. Now because several Countries give divers names for one and the same thing, that you may the better understand what is meant by Frith, my meaning is, all small lops or shread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of trees, as also all Under-woods. Thus having made pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for the planting Timber-trees by preparing a sufficient Fence for the shrowding and safety of the tender Plants, <hi>In the next place we shall consider of the Original of Grounds and Plants: The Eternal God hath been pleased to reveal many things unto us exceeding fense and reason; as the first production of the World, and the constitution of things invisible; and by his exceeding wisdom saw that his invisible things might be expressed by visible images,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64535:23"/>
wherein his Power, Wisdom and Goodness might be revealed; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he proceeded in an order and manner proper to every creature. The first Principle of this visible world was matter but confused and dark, then secondly the Spirit of Life diffused throughout the whole matter made it begin to stir, and insinuating it self into all the parts, produced every Creature, introducing into every one its own form; and to the perfecting all things which are and have been made in the World, there was added Light which is the third Principle: this Light began presently to display its threefold Virtue of illuminating, moving it self, and heating; from the brightness and motion of the Light was the difference of Nights and Dayes; the third effect of Light was from heat, which ratified and purified the matter, but condensed it on both sides upward and downward, whence came the division of the Elements, so that the waters above the Firmament, and the waters below, the Earth as thick dregs came together. The Earth being settled, God begins to fit and prepare it by the heat of the Celestial Light, which began to beget fat vapours on the Earth, whereinto the living spirit of the world insinuating it self, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Plants to grew up in various forms.</hi> We shall proceed to consider of the Nature of Grounds in general, and also in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular of barren and fruitful Earth: Grounds are simple or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, simple are Clays, Sands, or Gravels, compound where these Earths are mixed or all mixtures of earth: Clays, Sands or Gravel may be all good, and very fit to plant all manner of Trees in; and likewise they may be all very evil and barren; for all Earth simple or compound doth participate with the Clime wherein it lieth, as hot or cold, moist or dry: And where the ground or earth participateth of all the Elements equally, there it is the more fruitful: All grounds may be known as well by their several Characters as by the Clime or situation of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent. Some grounds naturally produce Weeds, as Mallows, Nettles, Docks, Hemlocks, or such like, which generally grow in every good and fruitful ground; there is another sort of ground that hath a different face or character, such as beareth Daisies, Clover, Charnock, Mustardseed, Rushes, &amp;c. this also
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64535:23"/>
may be a very good ground to plant in; but this is ever to be observed; where weeds or grass doth naturally grow strong and big, that earth is undoubtedly most rich and fruitful: But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though both these grounds may be good for Corn or Grasse, yet the Planter may be deceived by these outward faces and chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, if he search not deeper into the Bowels of the earth; for it is well known that many a Tree of great bulk and worth is and hath been seen to grow in a barren earth for Corn or Grass; and on the contrary there are and have been seen many small Trees of little worth growing in strong grounds as to the outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and those small trees of the age, or older than the other of greater bulk; for that ground may be good for Corn and Grass, or the planting of small Fruit-trees, which hath but six or seven inches of good earth, or the crust of the earth but six or seven inches deep. Another character of barren earth is when you see instead of Grass which would be green, rank, and thick, a pale thin small grass something blewish, also much Moss; or when the ground is covered with Heath, Furrs, Whins, Gors, and such like, these are apparent signes of great barrenness, especially if weeds or rubbish be small; for as before is mentioned, what ever it be that numbers the ground, the greater and ranker it is, it argues the richer ground. Thirdly, there are other barren grounds which may be so adjudged by the scite or clime where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they lie; as when the ground is far remote from the Sun or very near the borders of the sea; for the storms and ill vapours arising from thence poison and starve the earth, and are destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to Plants and Trees; also when the ground lies mountai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and high, and very stony and rocky, these are signes of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renness; yet the stony and rocky <hi>ground may have good earth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath, so that the Rock be not an intire stone, but have clefts and passages unto the earth to plant the Seed or Plants, and being once planted and thriving, will in time open a widen passage, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Timber-tree of as great a bulk and worth as other grounds void of stones.</hi> And this experience tells us also, that Trees of small strength in comparison of the Oak, being planted near a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64535:24"/>
stone Wall, the roots have so swelled or increased, making their own way by reason of a hard Rock some depth under ground, which the roots could not enter, that they have lifted up the said wall, &amp; in few years thrown it to the ground. Fourthly, there is another character or figne of barrenness, which is to be adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the constitution of the ground: <hi>For it is well known to them that are not ignorant of the Constitution of the World, that a Body is composed of all the Elements, Earth, Air, Fire, Water; and although all these Elements are simple Bodies of themselves; yet in all Bodies else are all the Elements; for that Water doth eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate into Air, and that Water is made again of Vapour, the Rain teacheth us: and that earth and water also is rarified may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by many examples, and that fire the spirit infused working by heat in all bodies is not to be denyed; by this you see, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of a Body participates of the four Elements, which is to say qualities; hot, cold, moist, and dry:</hi> But to return again from whence I digressed. The constitution of that ground where one of the four Elements doth most predominate is an apparent signe of barrenness, as when the grounds are either extremely cold and moist, or else hot and dry: Now these cold grounds are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally Clays, except such as are subject to inundations of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or land Springs, which are all cold and may be unfruitful. These cold and barren Clays, <hi>as by the outward face and character judgement may be given,</hi> generally produce Broom, Gorse, Moss, Shrub-bushes, and such like; and the reason of their unfruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is, first from their tough nature and bindingness, in the Winter the Pores are so closed that the rain or snow falling and melting cannot soak into the earth farther or deeper than the pores are opened by the roots of Trees and Plants, or Corn and Grass; wherefore lying at the roots it doth benum and chill them; and thereby hindereth the growth, and indangers the stock through an extreme moistness, and every extreme is death or dangerous. Secondly these barren earths will require much more dung than better earths, and yet not last half the time, for by reason of the stiffness and bindingness of the Clay the soil
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64535:24"/>
cannot incorporate with it, so that both Corn and Weeds will soon draw away or spend the substance thereof, and that which remaineth good above will exhale, or if the ground<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly steep, then the rain will wash it away. Thirdly if the Spring or Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer be very hot and dry, the natural toughness of the Clay doth so fetter and lock the roots or grain within the mould, that it will not give them liberty to sprout, or if it doth, yet the cold after much rain will presently starve the root, and make the stem utterly unable to bring forth profitable fruit, as I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly declared: next unto the Clay is Marle and Chalk grounds, they being derived from
the Clay: Marle is of several colours as are the Clayes and Sands; Chalk is only a kind of white Marle; <hi>for it was Marle before it was Chalk, and both of them earth or clay at first (only) became hardned and coloured by accident, as stones are coagulated with water and fire, which we may well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in Bricks and earthen Pots; for here Art imitates Nature; as also that they are subject to Calcination, as Lime, Stones, Flints, and the like</hi>; but because Marle hath its original from the Clay, I shall leave it to be adjudged by the outward appearance, as the clay ground is; excepting that there you will find no Broom and Gorse, or such like weeds, for Marle is a great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my unto those kind of incumbrances. <hi>As the barrennese of Clay grounds are known by the outward faces and characters, so also are Sands.</hi> This earth is of several colours as the clay: those Sands that lye upon mountainous and rocky places are generally barren, which may be perceived by the small, pale, mossy, and yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish grass which they bear: other Sands that lye lower in wet morish Plains or bottoms are generally of colour blackish, and produce a long sower unwholesome grass, but where the ground lieth dryer, the earth or sand will be very white or yellow, and produces a short small blewish mossey grass: the greatest part of these unfruitful Sands are much subject to Heath, Furres, Brakes and such like. Now a great cause of the unfruitfulness of this barren sandy grounds, is by reason of the porousness or hollowness of the earth, as was said before; for although it be
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64535:25"/>
well manured with soil or dung, yet much rain or wet will wash down the dung lower into the earth than the roots of the Corn or Grass, which is the reason of Plow-trenching in sandy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. Now the manner and way of Plow-trenching, (having here mentioned it) and because we may have occasion further to mention it in our after planting is as followeth: First the Plow having cast up the furrow, taking a good stitch (as they call it in husbandry,) after the Plow there follows 12 or 14 men with spades, who delve or dig a spit or spade deep in the bottom of the furrow where the Plow hath gone, which they cast or lay upon the earth or ridge which the Plow first threw up; then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the next turn of the Plow, but that which is then cast up is thrown into the Trench, the men left to fill it again: the men as before still follow the Plow, and dig or cast up out of this second furrow another spades depth of sand or earth, which they cast on the second ridge of sand that is thrown up by the Plow; and so a third and fourth ridge, the delvers following the Plow and the Plow them, during the dayes work; by which you may perceive that the upper earth or sand is buried, and the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most or fresh sand laid uppermost: so likewise in delving, or more properly trenching, the ground is delved two spit deep, the second spit or undermost earth is laid upon the first spit or spadeful of earth. By this piece of Husbandry it is easily to be understood that this barren sandy ground, being hollow, loose, and light, the fatness or substance that should nourish the roots of the grain, is by much rain within two years time washed or sunk so deep into the earth, that it will not serve for any other sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or seed time without more soil or new trenching: And as much wet and rain is the cause of unfruitfulness of the hungry hollow barren sands, so likewise is drought, for the earth being loose and hollow, the Sun by his heat doth draw up the moisture and richness of the earth and soil which the Rain doth leave. A third sort of simple ground being barren and unfruitful, is the Gravel which is mixt with it, a hungry earth not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the gritty loose Sand: This ground if it lie high and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64535:25"/>
then the outward face and character will appear as it did in the poor Sand and Clay: one cause of its barrenness is from cold, the Gravel wanting good earth to warm and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish that which should grow in it: Also because in time of Drought the Sun will scorch and burn up the fruit thereof, be it either Corn or Grass, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if this Gravelly ground lie low, then it is subject unto Land-springs, which within the Earth wash away that substance and fatness from the Roots of corn and grass, that should be their nourishment, also much Rain doth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise wash away the fatness and goodness of the Earth, by reason of the roundness and hollow looseness of the stones; so, that what with the waters within the ground, and the Waters above, also the heat and scorching of the Sun, which doth dry up more easily its moisture; this kind of earth must of necessity be unfruitful, neither is there any way to improve it but by ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering out the Stones, laying store of good Earth and Soil in the room, and making draynes to carry away the Water: I shall not advise any to begin this piece of Husbandry, because the Charges will amount unto so much, and better Land may be purchased at a cheaper rate. Now, as by the outward face and character, and by the Clime and Constitution of all sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Grounds doth appear the Richness and Fruitfulness of the one; and the poorness and barrenness of the other, so likewise by the same Rule, there may be judgment given of all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Grounds, or mixed Earths, as Sand, with Gravel, or Clay, or Loome, with Gravel or Sand, or other Earths. By this which hath been spoken concerning the Nature of Grounds, either simple or compound, the Husbandman may have true Knowledge to order and dress his Ground, and by purging and cleansing the same from those faults that hinder the increase, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a large and ample Crop of Corn or Grass. But yet the honest Arborist may be at a loss in Planting of Timber-trees, if he go no deeper then the outward face of the Earth, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most every <hi>Ditcher</hi> can speak by experience in making of a Ditch, that the crust or good earth many times doth lie but two
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64535:26"/>
or three inches deep, and the next Earth proves a hard hungry Gravel about a Spades depth more, the next Spades depth, or under the Gravel, it may be shall rise a cold barren Clay, and under that, 8 or 10 inches more, a good Loome or Sand; Also in rich Earths the Crust may lie 17 or 18 inches deep, and under that depth a hard Gravel, or Rock of Stone, Quarry of Slate, or such like; There being as many faces, or characters of good and bad earths under the ground, as above, or upon the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies, but this must be tryed by an instrument hereafter menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. There are other grounds that have no crust or good earth above, but either a barren Sand, hungry Gravel, or cold Clay, and such like, and yet within twelve inches depth have a very good Earth; And that there are several Vaines and sorts of Earths, good and bad, of all these Qualities, he that diggeth Mines and Wells can averr: Also, <hi>That there are several Vaines of good and bad Earth upon the Ground, Gardners and Plowmen can testifie; There are likewise several sorts of ground that may be good for Corn and Grass, or small Fruit-Trees, and Bushes, yet not good for the Planting of Timber-trees.</hi> First, such Grounds that have a good crust or earth 12 or 14 inches deep, and under this good earth a cold wet Gravel, being full of Land-springs, (which is Water running within the Earth, and shews it self, or is discovered by breaking out, or spewing up in many places) this and the like are not sound grounds to Plant Timber Trees in, because after the Rootes of the Trees have passed down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards deeper then the good Earth, the young and tender shootes of the Root, that the sap causes every year to spring forth, are by reason of the too much moisture and cold water within the earth chilled and benummed, so that they have not strength to enter the earth underneath the Water, or if they do, the Water following also after, doth continually hinder them in their growth, and keep them from thriving, and so consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Tree. Secondly, such grounds as have the same, or as good earth as before mentioned above, but underneath a Rock or Quarry, extending many Yards or Rods, are also not proper
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64535:26"/>
for Planting Timber-trees, for after the rootes of the Trees have grown deeper into the earth then the crust or good earth as aforesaid, and reacht unto the Rock, they cannot enter, and being only maintained by the upper Roots that spread along the crust of the earth, can never grow to any bulk, not having sufficient nourishment for all the Roots, and thereupon neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily want so much of their due growth; And although such Trees may thrive 50 or 60 years, yet as they grow in heighth and greatness, so much the more are they in danger of every Wind; because those Rootes that should grow deep into the earth, not only to support the Tree by nourishment, and ballance it by weight, but, as strong Cordes, to bind it fast unto the earth, are altogether hindred and disappointed of their true use, by reason of their Rock or Quarry; also those Rootes that touch the Rock, for want of entrance will in a short time pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish and decay, and not only to the hinderance of the growth, but shortning the life of the Tree: This stoppage, or decay of the Root, may be discerned several wayes, first, the middle Boughes that generally grow streight upwards, and proceed from the heart, will decay at top, which may be known by the falling of the Leafe. Secondly, The Bark will grow black. Thirdly, The Sap, which is as the Blood, having not its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral course, by reason of the stoppage of the Root, will break out into Boyles, which are great Bunches in the Barke, Body and Limbes of the Tree; All which evils will hinder the growth and increase of the Tree, and in time cause it to be hollow. Now, since it concernes every one that will be at the Charges of Planting, to search into the Bowels of the earth, and not to be satisfied, or trust to the outward face there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, There should be provided for the same use or purpose an Iron Augar, such as is used for the searching after Mines or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals: and although this way of searching or trying the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Earth under ground, will require labour and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet it will be of great concernment and singular use; there being a vast difference between the Planting and Sowing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64535:27"/>
of Corn, and sowing and planting Seed or Plants for Trees; for the Husbandman, in a years time after his Seed is sown, may know the goodness of the ground, and amend the evils thereof; or forbear farther charges, and let it rest for the feeding of Cattel; whereas the Planter must wait many years in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to know the goodness of his ground, and only guess it at last, without any certainty, only by the growth, or thriving of the Trees Planted.</p>
            <p>Having briefly discoursed of unfruitful grounds, by reason of the Constitution and Clime, or scituation of the Countries wherein they lie, it will be needless to speak of those rich and fruitful Clayes in <hi>Buckinghamshire, Leicestershire,</hi> &amp;c. and of the fruitful Sands in <hi>Surry, Middlesex</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi>; also those rich and fruitful Gravels, and compounded or mixt Earths in <hi>Bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi> and <hi>Hartfordshire,</hi> with many other Shires: All these fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soiles, if there be not those hindrances in the Bowels of the earth formerly spoken of, will require no other charges then only the choice of good Plants, and care in planting them: As for poor unfruitful Grounds having but a thin Crust, yet good earth at the depth of 18 or 20 inches, the Seed or Plants that are to be planted in such grounds, are to be nourished and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained until their Roots descend and reach unto that good earth, therefore not only choice Plants are to be provided, but also good earth, thereinto to set or plant the Seed and Plants: But of this it is necessary that you have more particular directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; There is therefore not any of those Lands formerly spoken of, either fruitful or barren, but may be very good for planting Timber-trees, except these few following; First, all Lands that lie near the skirts and borders of the Sea, for the Mists, Fogs and Winds that come thence will much indanger them, and hinder their thriving. Secondly, All high and dry Mountains, for they do not only want moistness of Earth, but are infested by great Winds, which frequently blow in such places, and are very hurtful; and although there are, and have been seen great Trees growing on high Hills, yet it is my opinion they were
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64535:27"/>
not planted there by Man, but were the production of the earth, and an effect of the first Creation. Thirdly, All Lands that lie flat, and are subject to Inundations of Waters, for want of a Descent or Current to carry them off some other way; for although moist earth is good for Trees, yet too much moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, as Water, lying long on the ground, or at the rootes of Trees, is dangerous, if not Mortal. Fourthly, All Moorish wet grounds, for although there are, and have been many great Trees growing in such grounds, yet very seldome any sound, well coloured, or long-liv'd Timber-tree. Fifthly, All entire Chalke Grounds, for such grounds are cold and dry, and not good for Trees; but if there be a mixture of other Earth with them, then it may be good. Sixthly, All grounds that are Rocky, or very Stony, either under, or above the Earth; for, although Trees may thrive in such grounds, yet it will require much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and charges, and I am very dubious of any long thriving of Trees so planted. Now the Plott of ground that I shall make choice of to Plant Timber-trees in, should be low and plain, but somewhat ascending towards the middle of the Plott, that so the Floods after Rain may run clean away, yet slowly, not rising higher, if possible, then may be convenient to water the whole from some spring or River, that in the summer, or drought it may be moistened, cooled, and refreshed, and laid dry again at pleasure; which would not only produce Grass wonderfully, but make the Plants and Trees grow more in seven years, then they will in other grounds that have not these helpes and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in 15 or 16 years. The Soil or Earth should also be a rich and fruitful Clay. Being now provided of a Plot of Ground to Plant, and having proportioned the Fence, and computed the Charges, the next thing to be considered is the choice of seed and Plants; <hi>Seed is only the Image of the Plant or Tree gathered together into a very small part of the Matter; Plants are the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Seed, for the universal spirit of Life was infused, or put into the matter of the World by that great Herbarist our Eternal God; and so insinuating it self through all the parts thereof, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64535:28"/>
into every Creature its own form. Now the Spirit of life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted into this lesser forme as aforesaid, is the seed of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, of what kind soever they be, and whereby their several species are propagated in the World. Having now propounded it to my self, as the end of my discourse, by Planting Timber trees to supply the Wasts that have been committed in His Majesties Forrests, and to shew how other parts of the Kingdom, which now are but of little use and profit unto the owners, may be improved</hi>; I shall in the next place do something in order thereunto: But, because it would be tedious to run over all the several sorts of Trees known to us in <hi>England,</hi> which upon occasion may be made use of for Timber where no other can be had; I shall confine my self to four sorts only, the Oake, the Elme, the Ash, and the Beech; And he that can well Plant these, may likewise all other sorts of Trees, whether of Pleasure or Profit; and because Seed, as I told you, is the Original of Plants, we shall begin with the sowing of that; And to do it more effectually, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the course that it is to be supposed every careful Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man doth, before he begineth to Plant his Ground, <hi>viz.</hi> cleanse it of all incumbrances which may either hinder his Plow, or choak the Seed; as Bushes, Stumps, or Rootes of Trees, which is performed by Grubbing; but, if Goss, Whin, Heath, or such like, then it will be needful for such ground to be Hackt, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonsheared, so called, because in that Country this work, or kind of Husbandry is much used; <hi>And if any hard Gravel, Quarry of Stone or Rock be within the reach of the Plow-share, it will be loss to Plow, and Sow, or Plant such Grounds with Seed for Trees; but, having a true knowledge of the nature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the ground, it being thus cleansed of all Rubbish, and prepared ready for the Plow, we shall proceed in the choice of our Seed; And, as it argueth much weakness in any man to want Seed at the season his Land should be sowed, so is it unnecessary expence to provide much more then will serve the turne; for Seed is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally dearer then that Corne of the same kind, which otherwise may be better spent in the House; and, although it ought to be
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64535:28"/>
of the cleanest and soundest Corn, yet the smaller is rather to be chosen then that which is very large; Now, to bring this home to our purpose; of the foresaid Timber-trees, there are but three usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produced by Seed, the Oake, Ash, and Beech, for the Elme is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued from Age to Age by Slips, Shoots, or Suckers, which sprout from the Rootes, it being a general Rule, that those Trees which bear little seed, or seed of small use, the Slips and Suckers will grow sooner, and thrive better then those of Trees bearing Seed: I can speak it of my own knowledge, that the Chips of Elmes newly cut, and falling among long ranck Grass, have in few years taken root, and grown up to a reasonable Coppice, the reason thereof may be from the Oyley and glutinous substance; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Spirit of a Plant or Tree is dispersed throughout the whole body; and therefore however the matter may be vexed by Chipping, yet the Spirit contains it self, and will remain in that small portion of the matter that is cut off, rather then forsake it quite, or else Slips and Succors could not grow to so great Trees as usually they do; yet it is my opinion, that the Elme taken from Chips will not be long lasting, or grow to any greatness, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is but a very small portion of the matter in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of that which is in Slips and Succors:</hi> Now the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e ought to be great care taken in the choice of your Seed for Trees, because the defect of them is not so visible as that of Corne. The Kernel of an Acorn may be Worm-eaten, or half rotten and perished, and yet the husk or shell whole and firm, as we see in Nuts; so likewise will the Seed of Beech, very few of them prove sound and fit for our purpose; The Acorns which I would advise for Seed should be of a middle size, or something better, and not of the largest; but very full and hard, and the husk or shell smooth and shining; and in the water those that soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est sink are the best Seed: The Beechen Mast, and the Ashen Keyes would be of the largest size, plump, and full of Kernel. We shall now consider the Quantity of Seed to be set or sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which must be proportioned to the ground that is to be planted, and the distance between the Plants. The nearest
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64535:29"/>
distance that can be allowed to have good Plants, and most profitable to be afterwards transplanted, is 12 inches, or one foot; And, to save every man a labour in counting the quantity of Seed and Plants to be Sowed and Planted, I have thought my Paines well bestowed to do it here.</p>

               <p>You have set down the manner and way of planting one Acre of land Statute measure, that is 16 foot and a half to the Pearch; with Seed or Sets for Timber-trees and Vnderwoods, at several distances, as from 1 foot to 4 Pearch: Also the converting of the said Woods to several uses, with the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Profit in performing the same, and several Observations in planting the said Woods: Also a Conjecture at the Growth and Age of Timber-trees, as Oaks that are now standing and grow; which said Trees may be probably concluded to be the Production of the Earth at the Creation of the World: together with Preparatory Directions by plowing and sowing, with choice of Seed and Plants in order to the planting a thousand Acres.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>WE shall proceed in an orderly way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with one Acre, and then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given you the Distance for Sowing, Setting, or Planting Seed and Plants in this Acre, will do the same in a Thousand: An Acre of Land therefore containeth 160 square Perch, Rod or Pole, at 16 foot and a half to the Perch, which is 4840 yards, and at three foot to the yard is 43560 foot; so that one Acre of Land will take up of Seed to Plant or Set at the distance aforesaid, being one foot,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64535:30"/>
43560 Acorns, Ashen Keyes, or Beechen-Mast, or if planted with Plants, the same number of Plants: Now because Seeds are not bought by Tale, but by Measure, I shall give you also the number of them by the Bushel, which containeth eight gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, and the gallon eight pints, Winchester-Measure; a Pint will hold or contain 100 of the greater sort of Acorns: by this measure you will find 800 Acorns in one Gallon, then in one Bushel will be contained 6400, so that one Acre of Land, containing 43560 foot will require so many seed of Acorns as come to 6 Bushels, 3 Pecks, 3 pints, half pint and 10 Acorns; Alwayes observing what distance of Land is left between the outmost row of plants, and the fence or bounds of the Land planted, and for so many foot, or every foot left in distance, to deduct one seed or plant out of the Number given, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder will be your desire.</p>
            <p>This first, or nearest distance of ground between the plants, is only proper for the setting and sowing seed for Transplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other Lands or plots of ground, which must be performed by drawing the middle or inmost plants, leaving the remainder thinner, or at a greater distance; And this work would be done at 2 or 3 years growth at the farthest, before the Roots touch, or are too much intangled. The next distance in planting is three foot, or one yard, then have you in this Acre of ground containing 160 pearch, 4840 square yards, and the same number of seeds or plants must be provided as there are yards, which, if Acorns, come to in measure three pecks 40 Acorns; but th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The next, or second growth of these Ashen stocks may be cut at 9 years; and, if they all thrive, the Sap will put forth four or five shoots out of every stock, and from each stock may be chosen two Hop-poles, then there will be 9600 Poles in the Acre of ground, besides the Offal Wood; the Poles being sould at the lowest price aforesaid, amount unto 48 pounds; but, if sould for 12 shillings the hundred, then they will amount to 57 pounds 12 shillings: A third felling, or cutting of this Ashen-Wood may be at eight years end, and then the shoots w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is a gallant improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if there were vent for many Acres of Land to be thus Planted. Now, by the next time of felling or cutting, the Oaken plants will be grown to handsome Trees: But, it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that as the Oakes grow in greatness, they will hinder the thriving and growing of the Ash, which is now become under-Wood, and the Rootes of the Ashe w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nding and twisting about the Roots of the Oakes, will much hinder their growth, and this is the evil of Planting at two near a distance: A third distance in Planting Timber-trees is one Perch; at this distance there may be made use of the Ground that lies between, either for Corn or Grass: And if you intend to sow Corne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Land is Plowed, Sowed and Harrowed, you may set the Seed, or Plants for Trees thus, At the distance before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed plant four Seed or Plants four foot distance from each other in

a square, then either about the square-piece of ground, or about every seed or plant you must set up several sticks, that the Mower or Reaper at the time of harvest do not cut off, break or bruise the young Plants; also, that the plants may be weed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the ground kept plain about them: Now, if you will not sow the ground, but keep it for Hay, then there must be digged at the distance aforesaid a Plot of ground four foot square, and in that Plot set or plant four seed or Plants as aforesaid, at each corner one; you may let all these plants grow nine or ten yeares, and about that time you may thus dispose of them at your pleasure; first, leave one of the best growing Plants in each Plot to be a Timber-tree, then cut down the other three and preserve the stocks for under-wood, as before mentioned, or grub them up, that the Timber-trees may the better thrive; or, if you approve not of their so long growing together, you may draw, or pull up three of the four plants at three years growth, and plant them in other grounds: At this distance and way of planting there will be planted in one Acre of ground 640 plants. Now all these plants that you appoint for Hop-poles, must be such, as are most capable to produce those poles; for Oake, Elme and Beech are not of use for poles, the reasons shall be given when we speak of planting Coppice, or Groves for under-wood; Now of these 640 plants we will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose 600 of them to be Ash, and 40 Oakes, these Oakes to be planted at 33 foot distance, and to grow for Timber-trees, at 9 or 10 years growth the Ashes may be cut down; then have you 600 poles worth 12 shillings the hundred, and comes to 3 pounds 12 shillings, but at fourteen shillings the hundred is four pounds four shillings. The stocks of these Ashes will live longer, and thrive better, also produce larger and more poles then if planted at the last distance mentioned, because they have more ground to feed them, and the hindrance, by touch of the Root, will not be much prejudice for many years, by which meanes, at the second season for cutting, you may have 1200 good Hop-poles, worth in the Wood or place of cutting fourteen
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64535:31"/>
shillings the hundred, which do come to 8 pounds 8 shillings; but at the next or third season of cutting the said Ashen stocks may produce 3600, which being sold for 14 shillings the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred amounts to 25 pounds 4 shillings.</p>
            <p>Now although the profit of this Acre by Poles doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount unto so much as the last planted at three foot distance, yet it is made up another way: First we have in this last Acre the benefit of the ground for Corn and Grass: Secondly the Trees and Under-wood will thrive better and grow greater in a shorter time than the other: more might be said, but this at present may suffice. And if you do not esteem of or like the way of planting for Hop-poles or Under-wood thus amongst the Timber-trees, but would have the benefit of the ground only for Corn and Grass, then you cannot plant at a nearer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance than two Perch, which is 11 yards; and because all grounds have not depth of earth alike; for the crust in some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will be 15 or 16 inches deep, and in other places of the same ground but 5 or 6 inches, and yet good earth a greater depth, Therefore my advice in planting all Grounds at any great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is, first to delve a Plot of land 4 foot square, and let <hi>the</hi> 4 <hi>angle points or corners of the square</hi> lie North-east, North-west, South-east, and South-west; that the Plants which are to be parted in those Plots may have the benefit of the Sun all the day; this performed, then cast up a small trench or ditch a foot deep if there be so much good earth, and 18 inches wide; let all this earth be evenly laid on the Plot delved, the Clods hackt or cut small, and the grass and weeds gathered or weeded out; this done, set or plant one seed or plant about a foot from each point or corner of the square Plot, and in the middle one, then you will have 5 Seeds or Plants in this Quadrat: Now at every 30 foot distance throughout the acre of Land delve or cast up such a Plot of ground, so you will have 40 quadrats or square plots in the whole, and leave a sufficient distance of land between the outmost Rows and the Fence: The Seed or Sets planted in the whole ground are 200, which may all grow 3 or 4 years,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64535:32"/>
then leaving one of the best Plants of what kind of Timber-trees you please; pull or craw up all the rest, which you may either sell, give away, or plan in other grounds; the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will be 40. By this way or manner of planting you may make as much benefit of the Acre of Land within a small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as if there were not a Tree growing in it; and these 40 Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-trees being all Oaks within a hundred and fifty years may be worth 200 pounds, which is a good improvement, requiring no more charges than the first planting, and not losing any benefit of the land: And if this quadrat or square figure doth not like you, there may be digged or delved so many Plots of ground as aforesaid, round or circular, and the ditch cast up as about the squares; then plant or set the four Seeds or Plants equally about the Circle, and one in the middle, the four Seeds or Plants poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the four quarters of the Wind, as hath been directed. The reason of this way of planting is to increase the mould or earth; for the Plants to put forth their shoots in; also the being inclosed will preserve them from danger in time of Harvest: you may set Beans in these plots of ground, but not too near the Plants; and if you sow seed of the Furrs-bush about the edges of the bank, The Furres will keep the Plants warm in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and preserve them from being hurt by Cattel; and as the Plants or Trees increase the Furrs will decrease, or after the Plants are grown up out of the reach of Cattel, the Furrs may be cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now there is another way of planting not inferior to any of these formerly spoken of. We shall consider of the Acre of Land in length and breadth to be 40 perch long and 4 perch broad, the just content of an Acre at 16 foot and an half to the pole or perch. The Plants to be provided for the planting this ground may be of all the sorts of Timber-trees formerly menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; they should be about the size of the Thorn plants, yet something greater, but not bigger than an ordinary mans finger. The Plants being provided, you may begin to work thus; on
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64535:32"/>
the North, North-east, or North-west side of this Acre of Land make a Ditch 3 foot wide and 18 inches deep, the said Ditch to extend to the farther ends of the plot, which is 40 Rod: After the first Turf is laid with the swarth or grass side downwards, the upper side pared, chopped, and made even, and that the Plants are cut and trimmed, lay them on as you were directed in planting the Thorne hedge, only observing to leave the trunk or body of these plants one inch longer than those of the thorns: Also the distance of ground between these plants must be 3 foot. After the Plants are laid in an even rank or row with the slope or cut side downwards, or sidewayes towards the South, and the head of the Plants lying at least 7 or 8 inches higher than the roots; then cast or throw up good store of the best earth on the roots; afterwards all the earth which you cleanse out of the Ditch, spreading it all over the Plants plain and even: This bank is not to lye high as that of the Thorns, but level as other grounds: There is in this row or bank 220 Plants; now allowing 4 foot of ground that the first Plants and earth cast up as aforesaid doth cover. The second Ditch must be begun five foot distance from the head of the first bank, which is 8 foot from the beginning of the first Ditch. This second Ditch or Row of Plants will fall behind the first, and must be made and planted every way as the first; and after the second a third, and so continue keeping the same distance till all the Plot be planted: Then have you in the Acre of Ground 8 Rows, and 1760 Plants. The Trees that are thus planted will thrive and grow wonderfully; between the Ditches and Banks you may delve and sow, or set Beans, Pease, or any other grain or corn: This Acre of ground may be improved by planting for Timber-trees and under-Woods for Hop-poles, as you have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly directed. So much may serve for the improvement of one single Acre, which being too little a Plot to take up the whole industry of a Man, or my designe: I shall now take in a greater quantity of land, and proceed to a thousand Acres, which I at first intended.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:64535:33"/>The thousand Acres then doth contain by the Rod, Pole, or Pearch, at 16 foot and a half to the Pole, 160000, which is in yards 4840000, and doth amount unto in feet, or by the fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t 43560000: Now according to every one of these three Numbers, only considering the distance between the Fence and outmost row of Plants, as before mentioned, must the quantity of seed be provided, because you shall not be put to the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in counting how many of these seeds a Bushel by measure may contain, I shall give a particular account thereof, which take as followeth: The first number, the distance being Perches, will require 160000 acorns, which amounts to by measure, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the former Rule in the one Acre given, 25 Bushels; The second number, according to the distance of yards, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire 4840000 acorns, which comes to by measure 756 Bushels one Peck: The third or last number being feet will require 43560000 acorns, which will come to by measure 6806 Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shel one Peck: As for the other seed, which are Ashen keyes and Beechen Mast, they may be also measured by the Bushel as the Acorns, first counting how many of each will go or will be contained in one pint or gallon: Having considered and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted what the charges both of seed and Plants will amount un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, by knowing what quantity to provide, and how you may be furnished to serve your occasions. The ground being in good season, and the time of the year answering thereunto, you may proceed thus: The chief Instruments which are useful for this work of planting is the Plow and Spade; the Plow will dispatch the greater quantity of ground in a day, but the other will make the best work; we shall compute the charges of both in his due place: There is no certain rule to be observed in plowing ground in all places alike; for according to the nature and cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mats of Countries, where much heat or cold, moisture or drought; as is the Earth or Air, so must the arborist alter his season; strong or stiff grounds will require great strength of Cattel; also the season must be early in the year: in other Countries where the earth is warmer, richer, and lighter, the Plow need not be
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64535:33"/>
of that strength which the former ground did require, neither will the labour of man or beast be so much; And, in such Countreys the season may be latter, yet nevertheless for all these Observations, he that hath much work to do must begin betimes, especially if he hath not a sufficient strength of Men and Cattel: Now the Plowman ought to be very careful in the plowing of his ground, how he shall lay his furrows, either high round and close together, or low and flat; also what depth he shall plow them, to raise and gain the greatest store of mould, for that is very considerable in planting Trees.</p>

            <p>The best time to begin Plowing for the planting Timber-trees, will be about the latter end of <hi>February,</hi> or the begining of <hi>March</hi>; if the Land require twice Plowing, which all Hey or Pasture-grounds do, for the swarth must be first broke, and torn
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64535:34"/>
to pieces with the Harrowes, or else cut with Instruments for that purpose, called Hacks, made of Iron; therefore there must be a second plowing, which will, by raising up new earth, increase, and make good store of mould again; and by this twice plowing, the Weeds and grass will be withered and destroyed, which are great enemies to young plants, as we have formerly declared: Now, for the manner of Plowing, supposing the Land to be very good earth for the purpose intended, and free from all Waters lying on the ground, &amp; other incumbrances; with a strong Plow, the share being of a good sufficient length, and the Culter somewhat bending, Throw down your Furrows, but if the ground be subject to waters, either by springs or floods in much Rain, then you shall lay the furrowes more high, near, and close together; and that every one of these Lands lie highest in the midst, observing to turn the swarth inwards or downwards unto the Earth, that the Roots of the grass and weeds may be scorched and dryed by the Sun and Wind, and so withered and destroyed: But, if you will be at the charges, which is the best Husbandry, then with the Hackers formerly mentioned you shall hew and cut to pieces all the earth that was plowed up; also all Balkes that the Plow had escaped, for by this work the weeds and grass will sooner wither and decay, and make the mould finer; after the hacking you shall take a pair or two of strong Iron Harrowes, and with them going over the ground break the Clods smaller: In the Month of <hi>August</hi> you shall begin to Plow over that ground again which formerly you had plowed, still observing what quantity of Land you have to plow, and your own strength of men and cattel, and accordingly you may begin sooner or later; At this second plowing let the Furrowes be made deeper and greater then at the first; Now, if the ground were a stiff Clay, or such like, then it would require to be hacked again, which will thoroughly break the Clods, and increase the mould, and by making the furrows great and deep, raise up more Earth which had been untouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before.

               </gap>shed, you may then sow and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64535:34"/>
plant your seed, but before you begin, it must be considered what part of the Land is most moist and dry, also in what part is the best and deepest mould, and where it is most shallow and meanest; for you must order and dispose of your seed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their several qualities, the Elme will require the best and deepest Mould, but beareth no Seed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, therefore must be planted by Plants or Setts: The Oake will require a moist deep Earth, but will not thrive if the water lie long on the ground: The Ashe will require a more dry kind of Earth, and will grow in a shallower Mould; The Beech will grow and thrive in a dryer, shallow and meaner earth then the Ash: And so having considered of these particulars, and finding your ground to have these several sorts of Earths, you must plant, sow, or set your seed and plants in that part of the ground where they will best like or thrive: But, if th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re be no difference in the mold or earth, then you may mix your Seed, and Sowe it toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but if you set the seed, then there may be a Row of Oake, and a row of Ashe, and another of Beech; or mix all of them in one Row as best pleaseth you; and thus may all other seed or sets be sowed or Planted: The fittest time or season of the year for sowing or planting this seed for Trees, is, when it is full ripe, and falleth from the Trees, which is about the latter end of <hi>October</hi>: But, it may be sowed or set in other Moneths if well preserved. In sowing of your seed be careful you do not sow too thick, for the thinner they are sowed, the better they will thrive; one foot distance is the nearest they should be sowed or set; if the plants come up closer then one foot, they must be drawn, or pull'd up the first or second year at the farthest; for those Plants that are planted at a foot distance, will be larger and bigger at three years growth then others which are planted thicker will be at five. Secondly, if they grow at that thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness longer then two years, the Roots will be so knit and intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled one within the other, that, in drawing of them you will break the Roots, they being tender, and so spoil the plants which otherwise might be of use for the planting other grounds; or the wast places in the same ground; for it is supposed, all the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64535:35"/>
seed that was sowed will not grow and thrive; and if they come up at no nearer then a foot distance, yet there would be a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten quantity to spare for the planting other grounds, because within the space of one yard must two or three plants be pulled up about the time before-mentioned, that the rest may thrive the better, and grow for use and profit, which they will not do at a nearer distance. Again, If plants grow thick any long time, they will indanger the whole Plot of Ground by starving each other: The first year after planting it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proper nor profitable to draw them up for any use, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the substance of the Kernels of the Seed will not be spent in the Roots, therefore in drawing up such plants they cannot thrive, because they want part of the nourishment that should increase their growth: Now, for my own part, I would not have them set or planted nearer then four foot in any great quantity of ground, but would the mean while have a Nursery of one or two Acres or thereabouts, as there may be occasion, where they might grow at a foot distance, but nigher, even there it would not be convenient; those that plant them nearer, or at even a foot distance, in any great quantity of ground, have but these two Reasons; The first is, for fear all that was set, planted, or sowed, should not grow and thrive: Secondly, To have Plants to stock other or more grounds; but, by this, they go about to make all grounds become Nurseries, and never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that the Land is thereby exceedingly impoverished. But now briefly to answer both these; To prevent miscarriage in the growth of Plants, there must be great care taken to provide good seed, &amp; that it be well searched &amp; picked from all that are defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive: And for the other, a Nursery of about two Acres will stock or plant a thousand at a distance sufficient for Timber-trees; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, there are many evils in sowing or planting at too near a distance, some of which have been already declared; we shall only add two more: First, The Charge in Weeding will be hereby increased unnecessarily; for, all Plants must be well weeded the three or four first years, and growing so near only with Weeding-knives, or by hand; whereas at a farther di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64535:35"/>
a good labouring man with a Hacker formerly mentioned, will Weed or Clense above an Acre in a day, and make better work then seven Women, though they ply it never so hard. Secondly, At four foot distance, which I propounded, the ground may be delved five or six years; and between the Plants, Beans, Wheat, or any other kind of Grain may be set or sowed, only to prevent the danger of the Sikle or Hook; in time of Harvest there must be three or four sticks set up round the Plants, as we have told you before; And, if no Corne sowed, there may be benefit made of the Grass, for the Plants will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no more Weeding then half a foot round, to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, is to be at great charges and expences, and have little or no profit: It is not my design or intent to disswade any man from sowing Seed for Trees, I only speak my judgement as to the distance. Now, immediately after you have sown your seed, take a pair, or as many as you can well spare, of very strong long-tooth't Iron-Harrowes (for in some Countries they use on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Wooden ones) with sufficient Men and Horse to order them, and so cover close all the Seed, which you will the better do, by often going over the Ground, for by breaking the Clots the Mould will increase, and become both small and more fit for that purpose: After the Harrower hath finished his Work, then let four or five Women and Children, or more, as your Work may require (for, as they are fittest for this Work, so they have less Wages then men) go all over the ground with setting Sticks, and set, or put into the ground all the Seed they find still remaining above, and cover it close; by which meanes it will be preserved from Mice, Rookes, Crowes, and other Vermin; for if the holes be not close covered, they will devour, and carry most of it away in a short time; For, the Plowman can speak by experience of several Hoards of Nuts, Beanes, Pease, Acorns, Beechen Mast, and such like, that have been cast up, a Pint or two together in a hole in the ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides many hoards found under the Roots, and in hollow Trees.</p>
            <p>Having Discoursed of Plowing and Sowing your Seed, we
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64535:36"/>
shall now speak a little of Planting; which may be divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three parts;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Planting by Seed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By Sets; that is to say Sets from Seed, Suckers and Slips.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Transplanting young Trees.</p>
            <p>Now a Plant is the production of Seed, and although all Trees do not bear seed, yet they came from Seed, which Seed is the Spirit of life, infused into the matter of the World, and was done the first day of the Creation.</p>
            <p>Of Plants there are in general but two sorts, a Tree, and an Herb; yet the variety of them, according to their species, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and colours, is so great, that they can scarely be numbred. The spirit of a Plant is called Vegetable, which puts forth its Virtue in Nutrition, Augmentation, and Generation; for Plants being indued with an inward Vigour break out of the Earth, and spread themselves in <hi>Plan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>; from thence called Plants: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, a Plant by its Roots and Tawes, or Fibres, sucks in the Juice of the Earth; the Bole or Body attracting the same doth augment, or grow into a great Bulke or largeness, sending it to the upper parts, which being there better concocted, breaks out in Seed; Plants grow upwards, because the vapour included spreading it self, tends upwards; The Bark, Leaves and Shells are but as the Skin and Garments, serving to defend the body from the injury of heat and cold.</p>
            <p>But to proceed: The best sort of Sets or Plants are such as grow from Seed, if they be removed before the Body and Roots are grown too large, and that all the Roots may be taken up without bruising.</p>
            <p>The Second sort of Sets, and not much inferior, if there can be a good quantity of Root taken with them, are Suckers which grow out of the Roots and Tawes of Trees; those that grow out of the Roots cannot be clean taken away without cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Roots of the Tree or Plant, which will both hurt the Tree, and do little or no good unto the Plant; such as are grown
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64535:36"/>
out of the Tawes may be taken away, and inlarged as you please with the Tawes and not hurt the Tree, these Suckers are the best, and will soonest become great Trees: Slips are in use for want of other Sets, but are the worst of all that have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, because they have but little Root, and that which is, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a main wound, will in short time destroy the Tree; for, although it may grow 60 or 80 years, yet it cannot well thrive, for the Roots will be so weak, that the Sap will be unable to put forth new of any strength, unless in a long time; and every wind will indanger it, by loosning the Roots, or else it will be soon nipt with frost or drought, these Slips are also Suckers growing out of the lower part of the Tree.</p>
            <p>To apply all that hath been said of plants and sets. There is not one point more to be regarded then the choice of those that are good, the ground being well plowed, hackt and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed, according to former directions. The best time to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>splant, or remove younger Trees, is at, or suddenly after the fall of the Leafe, about the Change of the Moon; supposing at that time the Sap to be most quiet: The fall of the Leafe is a Rule in all Countreys, though there be difference in its hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening, as to the time of the year, as also in the time that is to be accounted before and after it: In setting your sets or plants see that you have a special care not to go lower then the Crust of the earth; you may not fear to set them as deep as that will well allow: What is meant by Crust of the Earth hath been formerly declared; where the Crust is shallow, there it must be helped by adding good Earth, otherwise such grounds, or that part of the ground inclosed will not be fit to plant in; for, in the Crust or good Earth, the Plants first shoot forth their Roots, and thence draw their Sap, which doth increase and strengthen them to enter, and pierce farther into the Earth. Again, in setting, let the mold be small and moist, also shake the Plant easily too and fro, that the earth may run among the Roots and Tawes, then put it close, a little treading it with your foot to keep out the Air, which is very hurtful; after the plants are
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64535:37"/>
set, if no Rain falls, they should be watered now and then, which would make the Earth yeild sap and nourishment, and cause the Roots to grow and spread abundantly; Puddle-water would performe the Work excellently, were it not chargeable: All Parched and dry grounds that will not keep moisture, are very hurtful for young Plants, because every Plant hath a Body Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and porous, that the nourishing faculty of the earth may enter and pass through, and feed all the partes; but, dry earth cannot pass through the Tawes and pores of a plant, therefore the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of the earth only nourisheth: There are several Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about removing Trees and plants, most of them argued from the Rising, Descending and pride of sap; some at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving will mark the North-side, and have the same set so again. Others there are that yet do it as happily, observing no such Rule at all: There are some that are of opinion, It is best to remove Trees and plants before the Fall of the Leafe, and say, That the Sap descending will make speedy Roots: Again, there are others that say, It is good to remove in the begining of Summer: And, a last sort, that strongly affirm, It is not good to Remove till after the Fall; Several Countries have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Customes and Fashions answerable to the place wherein they live, we shall therefore leave every one to their own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Yet it is not wisdom for a man to bind himself more strictly to that or this Custom, then Reason shall be his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
            <p>Now, we have good experience, that it is dangerous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move when the Sap is not quiet, by Trees that are removed in the Summer, for they seldome live long, or, if they do live, they thrive not; for the life of the youngest plant shall scarcely be saved; if removed in the pride of Sap; for, every remove gives a main check to the stirring sap, staying the course thereof in the Body of the plant; For, as the blood in a Man is alwayes in motion and circulating, although there be several kinds of that motion, as sometimes very slow, coole and quiet, other times much stirring, and very hot, by reason of its swiftness. Now, if
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64535:37"/>
the blood, which is the life, alters the usual course, diseases fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; And, if it be stopt, it soon grows cold; and, if universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cold, Death follows. So likewise, Sap is the blood of the plant, and every removing in the pride of sap is a great stay, or stoppage unto it; like blood-letting in the midst of summer, which is very dangerous, and never used but in extremity, and often-times proves mortal; As it hath been said, That drought and cold are great enemies to Trees and plants, by staying of the sap: Therefore, in those Countries that lie farthest from the sun, and that are subject to cold Winds, the sap doth not rise, nor is in pride so soon as in other Countrys that lie more warme and moist: Also, in those Countries that lie nearest to the Sun, the sap doth rise, and is in pride sooner then in any of the former, but doth not continue long, because of the exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive heate; by this you see, that one Country, Climate, or Continent is not a rule for others to go by; And, as heate, cold, moist and dry alter in several Countreys, so they do likewise in any one of them: for, as is the season of the year, either hot, cold, dry or moist, so also the sap riseth, and is in pride earlier or later, by that occasion, in the same Country.</p>
            <p>There are many Men of opinion, That the sap lies still all the Winter in the Roots of Trees, and that towards the Spring it begins to stir, and after makes its appearance by Leaves, and Fruit, or seed all the summer: Also, that the sap riseth and passeth upwards only between the barke and Wood, with seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral more Opinions: But, because it is not my design to Resolve Questions, I forbear to mention any more at this time. The Sap, as it is the Blood and Life of the Tree, hath the Spirit of Seed included therein; and because every body being composed of vapours is moved towards a greater Company of its Cona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turals, that vapour coming forth when the Seed is warmed tends upwards: But, because the matter of the Seed is fat and gluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, the vapour being infolded therein, carries it upwards with it; and a part thereof being turned into the nourishment of the Plant or Tree, as covering of Wounds, putting forth of Buds,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64535:38"/>
and the growth of the Tree; the rest being gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into a certain place usually in the tops or boughs of the Trees, makes or becomes Seed: Again, The sap doth not pass upward only between the Barke and the Wood, as some would have it, but also into and through the very substance of the Tree, both Bark and Wood and all: And as for the Sap resting in the Roots more then in other parts of the Tree, I cannot consent unto it; for, if the comparison of Blood with Sap will be allowed, then, as the blood in Mans body is alwayes in moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on throughout the whole Body, and rests not after it hath circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated once only; but, as it hath been said before, in its motion is sometimes swift, other times slow, and very still and quiet, but, never at a stand except in great extremity, and that for a very small time; Even so must it be granted to be in Trees: Now, to conclude this point; it is supposed by most men, that a small time before the fall of the Leafe is the Stand, so called, or the turning of the Sap, or rather, that the Sap is cool and quiet; for, it makes no stay, except by reason of extreame drought or cold, at which time there is very small or little ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of life; therefore, because we do not know when the Sap is quite turned, or turning, but by the fall of the Leafe, It is the safest way to begin removing then, as also to sowe, or Plant, and so you may continue all the Winter, except in Frost and Snow; but, a Plant set about the fall of the Leafe shall be larger at three years growth, then that which is set the spring after shall be at four years; therefore the sooner you set or plant in Winter the better.</p>
            <p>Now, in transplanting it is but curiosity and trouble to mark every Tree and Plant, to have the same side stand to the sun as was before; for every plant that is right and well plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed should stand free from shade, the second row to stand over against the middle distance between the Trees of the first row, and so throughout the ground, and all of them so planted, that they have the benefit of the sun on all partes, as hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly directed: And, planting at first thus, you need not care,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64535:38"/>
or fear which de stands either to the North or south: Now, if you Plant your ground with sets, let them be of seed if pose sible, and not either of slips or succors; to buy sets is chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, also they may be broken or bruised in drawing out of th- ground, or carriage, if you trust unto such as either have not care, or skill in drawing them; therefore let the sets be of your own, if possible: In choice of your sets, let the Roots be sound and many, for as they are in number and goodness, so will the boughes be: Lastly, if the tops be tall, or more spreading then the Roots, you may proyn them, and cut off the tops, for every wound given when a plant is young will recover firmly in a short time, as about six years, yet there will be a hindrance in the growth of the Plant during that time; therefore consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering all these particulars, it is good to have sets of seed of your own, and at such a distance as not to remove at all, for every remove is dangerous: Although some of these observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been formerly mentioned, and also are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known, yet are they but little put in practice; I am sure it would quit cost for all the pains and expences that should be undergone in order to it.</p>
            <p>Now, if you intend to Plant a Plot of Land for Under-Woods only, or young woods, for House-boot or Plow-boot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not let any of the Trees grow to be great Timber; then as the Land is wet or dry, rich or poor, the crust deep or shallow, you must sow, or set such seed or Plants which will best thrive in those places: and, although Coppices, Groves, or Under-woods consist of all sorts of Wood, as Oake, Ashe, Elme, Beech, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Chesnut, Birch, Asp, Alder, Withey, Hornbeame, Hasle, Sicamore, Willow, and many others; yet, of all these, we shall make choice but of six, the rest being not considerable to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the Charges this way in planting, which are Oake, Ches<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut, Ashe, Withey, Haslle and Alder; Now, to give you the reasons of my choice, and why I look upon them as the best and most profitable, are these;</p>
            <p>First, They are quicker of growth then any of the other
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64535:39"/>
that I have omitted, for the Chesnut, Alder, Ash and Withey, will be taller and greater at eight years growth then any of them will be at twelve.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They will thrive in such ground as many of the other will not; as in much wet or moisture; also in dry and shallow earth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They may be converted to such uses as will render them more vendible, and yield greater prices then the other; For now, suppose you have an Acre of ground to plant, and that there be in it all the sorts of Earth before mentioned, then in the wettest part of the Land must you plant the Alder; This Tree is not friendly to Pasture or Meddow, because the Root thereof is of such a nature, that it draweth to it self so much moisture for its Nourishment, that the ground near it is good for no other use: the next that doth require a moist ground, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not so wet as the <hi>Alder,</hi> is the Withey; the Ashe and Hasle will grow in the dryest part, and in the shallowest Earth; the Oake and Chesnut will require a good earth, and deeper Crust then the last two; Thus have you the Nature, Quality, or Condition of the Plants, and where they best like to grow; But, it is to be understood, the Richer the Earth is, and the deeper the Crust, there they will best thrive. Now, because this Acre is but a small Plot, we will therefore Plant it to the utmost bounds: Thus the Land lying length and breadth, six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Perch long, and ten broad; the plants to be planted four foot one inch and a half one from the other, which is the one fourth of a Perch; At this distance there should be a square plot of ground delved or digged two foot square; about half a foot from the end or point of the four Angles set a Seed or Plant, such seed or Plants as will best thrive, according to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer directions; and, where the Crust is shallow, there should be made a trench about the several squares a foot wide and deep, the Earth to be cast upon the square Plot to increase the Mould; the whole ground being thus Planted, you will have 2560 square plots, wherein is planted 10240 seed or plants; if they
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64535:39"/>
all thrive, then about three years after at the season of the year for transplanting, one of the best of these 4 Plants in each or every square plot which doth most thrive must be preserved, and the other 3 drawn or puld up and disposed of at pleasure, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be planted in other grounds, else sold or bestowed on your Neighbours, the Plant which is left must be removed and planted in the middle of the Plot; this performed you will have remaining 2560 Plants. And you are to take notice that the Alder and Withey is not planted by seed, but Sets or Plants; the Ash, Chesnut, Alder, and Withey will serve for Hop-poles: the Oak and Hasle is the slowest and smallest of growth, and not useful for Poles, but for Hoops and Hurdles for Sheep-pens and such like; the Chesnut, Ash, and Withey are likewise very good to make Hoops for wet and dry Cask, as Brewers, Grocers, Soap-boylers, and many more Trades: Now also all these will make many necessary Implements of Husbandry, as Ladders, Rails, Plow-stuff and handles for many Tools, besides Firing; the Chesnut is special good Timber for Building, and many other uses; also the Oak and Ash; therefore there may be 20 of these preserved to grow for great Trees.</p>
            <p>To make the greatest profit of this Copice, Grove, or under-wood is to keep it clean from all Bushes, Brambles, and other Woods, which it may be subject unto if any old roots of trees be in or near the ground; also if any seed, as Acorns, Ashen keys, Beech-mast, Slows, and such like be brought in and scattered by Rooks and Crows among the long Grass or Plants; else by squir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, field-Rats or Mice, and hid in the ground, or under roots of Trees or Plants; For if any of these seeds be suffered to grow, they will be Incumbrances, and much hinder those that were rightly planted. These things being observed, and that you keep the Plants clean by well weeding, about ten years after the planting, this Copice or Grove may be felled, and every sort of Wood converted to their proper uses, as Hop-poles, Hoops, and other necessaries of Husbandry, which I shall have occasion more particularly hereafter to mention. Now in fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64535:40"/>
this Wood be sure you cut it smooth, and close to the ground; and after the stuff is sold and disposed of, be careful to cleanse the ground of all Chips, Sprays, and small sticks; also see that you make the Fence firm and strong, that no Cattel get in to tread on, break, or bruise the stocks of the Plants; and when the sap puts forth new shoots, that they be not cropt or bit, which doth not only hurt and spoyl the Crop for the next season of cutting, but is very hurtful unto the stocks: if you be careful to prevent these evils about 8 years after the first cutting, you may cut again, and then will there be all sorts of stuff four or five for one that you had at first cutting; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 8 years after this second felling it may be cut again, and then the encrease will be 7 or 8 fold: Thus will your Wood increase unto a hundred years, although not in quantity, yet in goodness and greatness; so that this Acre of Land shall be worth 10 Acres of the best Wood land that is of its own growing, or at a nearer distance, planted and cumbred with Bushes or other Wood but little better. Now if you will plant an Acre of Land with Oak, Elme, Beech, and Ash at a pearch distance, then may you have the benefit of the Land for other uses; and preserving the Plants in growing, about 40 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter planting you may fell or cut down the one half of the wood; taking the middle Tree throughout the ground; some of them may serve for small Buildings, also for Laths, others to make Axes for Carts, also fellows and spokes for Wheels, Tree-nails for building Ships: The Elme stuff may be of use for Ships, also for the Millwright, and to make Naves for Wheels if not too small; the Ash for broad hoops for Coopers set-work, great Vessels and Fats for Brewers, Oars for Boats, useful pieces for Plow and Cart, and many more necessary uses, besides Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But if these Trees appointed to be cut down may grow 40 or 50 years longer, than they may be converted to several uses, besides the last mentioned, as for the building small Ships, Tree-nails of all sizes, Planks, Inch-boards, Quarter-boards, Quarters, Bouls, Trays, Dishes, Trenchers; and such like.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:64535:40"/>Having discoursed of sowing, setting, and planting Seed and young Plants for Timber-trees and Under-woods in Copices, Groves or Spring Grounds; we shall now proceed and give our advice for the transplanting Trees of greater age and growth. It is no certain rule to judge the age of a Timber-tree by its bulk or greatness of body, for there are many hollow trees, and others not hollow, yet unsound, all of them much greater in the girt or body than sound thriving trees, which are twice the age of those great imperfect trees, and worth five times the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue: Again there are young trees called suckers, that grow out of the roots of older trees, which both hinder their own and the others growth, because the roots are not able to maintain both; so that a Plant well planted and thriving will be a greater tree and of better use and profit at 30 years growth than those suckers will be at 50; but if such suckers were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off in time, and planted, there would be a double profit, for the tree from whence it was taken will the better thrive, and also the plant may grow to be a great tree. Thirdly, there are trees that grow out of or from among the roots of trees that have been cut down many years; the roots of these young trees being much twisted about and entangled among the other al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though dead, yet as we have said formerly, every touch either of bough or root is hurtful, therefore such trees are much hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in their growth and thriving: Also all trees that grow in hedge-rows or thickets, what ever the wood be, as thorns or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wood; such trees cannot thrive or be long lived. Fourthly, some trees there are that grow and thrive for thirty or 40 years, and then are at a stand many years; after which time they thrive again, but generally decay and dye; the reasons are from some stoppage or obstructions within the earth which the roots of those trees met with, as either some great Land Springs or Current of water under ground, or hard hungry Gravel Rocks of stone, Quarreys of Slate, Chalk, and such like, which the roots of those trees did not reach unto until such a time of growth. Now if the Current of water alter its course, and the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64535:41"/>
Rocks or Quarreys be not great, but that the roots grow beyond them, or through some cleft<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then such trees may thrive again. Although it hath been said that the age of a tree cannot be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by its bulk or greatness, yet of those trees that have not been lopped or removed, you may know their age by reckoning from the root up to the top twig, every years growth being distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from other by a knot, if the tree be not above 20 years old; yet this is not a certain Rule for all trees, the knots of some of them being not easily to be discerned, therefore their age is not certainly known but from the time they were first set or plan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed; or if you plant with slips or suckers, you must reckon from the time the sap first put forth shoots; for if you trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant trees, and there being in the bark knots or boyls, they may be of great age, and yet small of growth; as knotted Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel being starved at first, yet may live possibly, but not thrive: Now if you cannot know the age of the trees you are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, then let your choice be of such as are streight, smooth, and whose bark is well coloured without knots or boyls. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly let the roots carry proportion with the body and boughs, that is round and spreading every way. Thirdly, let not the bole or body of the tree be above 8 or 10 inches about if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible; for this size or greatness will endanger life and growth; but the hazard will be much more if they are of greater bulk, because they must needs be tainted with deadly wounds either in the roots or top, or both, and after that are seldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver good. This evil in removing may be discerned within few years, by the tree bearing a small hungry leaf, also by the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of boughs and bark. Again, another danger in removing trees of such an age and greatness is, that if they be not very well staked, the winds by often shaking the body will loosen the roots, and break the young Taws or Fibres, which are not only the mouth as it were of the Root, whereby it sucks and draws the moisture or nourishment from the earth, but are as strings or tyes growing farther into the earth, fastning the roots and so the Tree; and these being broken will much hinder the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64535:41"/>
thriving, if not endanger the life of such Trees: Therefore all such great Plants or young Trees transplanted are only useful for ornament; as Walks and such like, or Pollards so called, because of the often poling or lopping of their heads; and usually grow in Hedge-rows, or else in Copices or other wast places; for of such trees the tops may be cut off at pleasure, and the bole or body left at such a height as may be convenient for the place and use of the said trees. Although these trees may not grow to become good Timber, yet they may live bearing arms and boughs, useful for Plowboot, Houseboot and Fireing many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years: And were it not for charges you may for these and such like uses transplan or remove greater Trees than those last spoken of; the way and custom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is to take up the whole Roots with the earth about them, and so set or plant them where there is a deep and good mould, for the roots and earth will so ballance the body and top, that not any of the boughs will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to be cut off, only such as are useless, which would be proyned betimes: And although trees of such growth and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness be removed, they may thrive and grow for Timber Trees, if the wast boughs be carefully taken off, and the wounds not too great, but recoverable. Many more Observations may be added, but these may suffice. Now in the planting or trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting those trees formerly mentioned there ought to be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter care taken than in younger Plants, for there is greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; also the growing and thriving of them is more uncertain, therefore we shall repeat over again some of our former Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: First let the trench or hole you dig to set the Trees in be so large every way that the roots may lie at length and not be bruised or broken by bending or forcing into the place. Secondly, set such trees in the deepest earth or crust, and so deep as the good earth reacheth, to prevent shaking by winds; also let the slope side of the wound be towards the South. As for those fond opinions of several men, that the roots of trees only grow and thrive in the crust of the earth as their Element, it is not denyed that the Earth is the Element for the roots of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64535:42"/>
all Trees and Plants, as the Water for Fish; but as Waters have several distinct tasts, smells, colours, and operations; also several kind of Fish haunt, delight, and thrive in those several Waters; as some in salt Seas, others in fresh Rivers, others in muddy Pools or Ponds, as the Carp, Bream, Chevin; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in shallow running gravelly streams, as Trout, Roch, Dace, &amp;c. others in mud and holes in the earth, as Eels, Crawfish, &amp;c. others in Stony bottoms under the water, as Lobsters, Oi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, Crabs, &amp;c. So likewise the Earth hath several distinct tasts, colours, smels, and operations; and also several kinds of Creatures living therein: And the Roots of Trees and Plants thrive and delight to grow in those several sorts of earth; and not only the Roots of several Trees, but of one and the same Tree. We do acknowledge that those Roots which grow in the Crust of the Earth most nourish the Tree, by producing the greatest quantity of sap, and yet there are other Roots also that grow downwards beneath the crust or good earth, through the several earths, and are for special use, as tyes and stayes to keep it up, by binding it fast unto the ground, as was said before, and likewise to nourish and feed both body and boughs: Also those Roots that run in the crust put forth other Roots down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards deeper into the earth; for were it not so those great and mighty Trees that lift up their heads high into the Air could not stand. Thirdly, let the earth be moist and mellow, that so falling between the Roots it may the better hold them. Fourthly, in setting be sure you shake the Tree easily, that the earth may fall and be dispersed every where among the Roots, and often treading it as you cast it on the Roots gently with one of your feet, holding the Tree upright with your hand, leaving no hollowness or vacant place for the wind to get in, which is very hurtful. Fifthly, let not your Plant or Tree be bound or tied to any Stake, or lean against any hold, but about every Tree set four Stakes, let two of them be set deep into the ground, the other two upon, or very little within the earth, that they may not reach the Roots of the trees; the 4 Stakes may stand
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64535:42"/>
seven or eight inches from the body of the tree, and would be four or five foot high above the ground, also braced above and below, about a foot from the top and bottom with braces to keep or joyn them fast each to other; but if the Plants or young Trees be in danger of being barked by any Cattel, as Deer, Goats, Hares, Connies, or any other, then you must board it between the Stakes, or add more Stakes, setting them close to the ground, but not drive them in: about the body of the Tree above and below, over against the braces there must be wound a good Wisp, Role, or Rope of Hay, containing in thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness 9 or 10 inches about: The Roles or Wisps of Hay rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or staying on the stakes and braces will bear off the body of the Tree from beating against them in every shake by wind from all parts or points from whence it doth blow, and so preserve the bark from bruising or breaking, and also keep the roots fast and free from shaking. Now considering all the trouble and charges about transplanting Trees of such greatness, it is better to plant by young Sets, and best by seed, and not remove at all; for a Set or Plant so small as a mans little finger, that doth thrive, in 20 or 30 years shall out grow and be greater in bulk and body than the greatest Tree before spoken of, both being planted at one and the same time, except those last removed, as aforesaid, with the earth about the Roots.</p>
            <p>Although there have been sufficient directions for the plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Timber trees, yet all these directions are of little worth, if after the trees are grown up you want skill to keep and dress them: for it is in a Tree as all things else, that they are subject presently to degenerate without good ordering: There be many men covet to have abundance of trees in a small plot of ground that will not maintain a fourth part of them; for we may see by daily experience many Woods that are so thick or over-grown with trees, where there are 4 or 5 suckers growing out of the roots of one tree, and the whole Wood so growing, the trees being tall and slender may so continue many hundred years and be of little worth: And at th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s thickness neither Sun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> nor
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64535:43"/>
Air, or Rain can profit, therefore neither themselves nor any thing under or near them can thrive. And besides this great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of suckers, which not only draw out the heart of the tree from whence they grow, but also starve themselves; there are many unprofitable boughs which must be likewise taken away; for all Ages and Countries consent to pruining of trees, yet there are too many unskilful men that know not those boughs which are to be cut off, or the time and season when to take them away: Trees are very subject to make their shoots disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, and the greatest trees, and those which grow in the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est earth are the most subject to be over-loaden with wastfull boughs and suckers, which draw the sap from the boal or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and hinder the thriving; these being timely taken away, the strength of all the sap will go to the Bulk, having recovered and skind as it were the knots or wounds, will put forth a long and streight body of profitable Timber, being great of bulk and of infinite lasting. Now these superfluous boughs are such as grow low under the others, or the lowest of all, called water-boughs, which by the over shadowing of them that are above, and by their often dropping on them are much hindred and want sufficient sap to maintain them, and therefore are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taken away. A second sort of suckers are your Scyons, which grow streight up from some lower part of the tree from pride of sap; these also receiving a great part of the sap much hinder the thriving of the tree, and therefore may be spared as the water boughs. A third sort are fretters, which are boughs, Arms, or branches growing so near together, that when the wind bloweth, they by their rubbing against each other wound their fellows, making galls, and breeding cankers, that in a short time will be incurable and indanger the whole tree, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such boughs must be taken away, for the longer they so grow, the worse they will be, and more dangerous to be taken off, because the wound will be so great that the bark will scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cover it again. Fourthly, in dressing Timber-trees, the chief care must be to maintain a long boal or body, which should be
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64535:43"/>
30 foot high before the first Bough be put forth; this may be easily performed following him upward with continual Lopping his under-growth and Water-boughes; and if he puts forth any bud in those parts that were lopped, which the Sap may do the next spring, or summer after; then rub off those Buds, or else Proyn them again before they are grown too big; And, as the end and benefit of an Orchard is much and good Fruit, so the end and profit in Planting Timber-trees is sound, well-coloured, Long, Large and Durable Timber, which is only to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished by careful Planting, good Ordering and Dressing your Trees in time, before the Armes and Boughes be grown too great, for when a Tree is young you may bring it to what forme you please, for several uses in building Ships, as Beames, Rudder-pieces, Crooks, Knees, Wale-pieces, or any other; But, it will be needless to shape Trees for crooked Timber, for there will be enough for those uses without the help of Art from the natural production of the Earth, by reason of several hidden causes; since therefore the true ordering and dressing of timber-trees is so requisite, and the knowledge of superfluous Boughes very necessary, I shall add a few observations whereby you may the better perfect the work and know them.</p>
            <p>First. There is no certain time of the year for all Countryes to begin Proyning; for, as the Clime is where the Trees grow, and the season of the year more or less temperate and mild, so may you begin earlier or later: Frost and Snow is no good sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; any time may serve after the leafe is fallen till it shew again, if you observe the time of the Moon, which is about the change; the best season is when the Sap is ready to stir, not when it is proudly stirring, and, the older the Trees are, the soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er you may begin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The waste Boughes that you take away cut off smooth and close to the Body or Arme, or any part of the Tree, striking upwards, if conveniently you can, and leaving no bunch, that the Sap may soon cover the knot or wound; for, such boughes which are not cut off close to the body, the Barke can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64535:44"/>
not in so good time cover the wound, but the heart of the knob which is left will slit or crack, and the winde and rain entering in, will cause hollowness, which will soon decay-that part; and, if many such wounds, then untimely death of the Tree will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
            <p>This evil, of not close cutting, or lopping, we have daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of, for there are many thousand Trees now decaying from that cause only, it being a general custom in lopping Trees, to cut off Armes, Boughes or Branches, sometimes two inches, sometimes four or five, sometimes more from the Body: Now, as there is much danger to a Tree by small boughes thus lopped, although but one time, much more is there in often cutting great Boughes, which make great wounds not to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered or cured; therefore all shredding and lopping of Trees doth much hinder their growth and thriving, which maketh so many Dwarfs, Pollards, and such like Shrubs, also so many May-pole-like-Trees, which are more fit for that then any other use, except it be a course Timber for the building Houses, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Postes and Rayles, or such like; These Trees may cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the ground many hundred years, and their growth scarcely be discerned: Now, it is no wonder to see so much deformity in great Woods and Forrests that lie farr remote from the Owners, whose too much trusting to unskilful and unfaithful Servants is the cause of so many evil Trees; Nay, even this we see in Orchards which are near at hand, and ordained for Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure as well as Profit; the ground is covered and cumbered with a company of skragged and crooked Hags, which never were, nor ever will be good; some runing up into the Skies, without form or substance in Body or Boughes; others Dwarf-like-trees, more Boughes then Body or Rootes; others like Hyd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>opical Creatures, great in bulk, but weak in heart, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the moistness of the earth which swells the Boale, but the boughes and branches are weak and fruitless: How many Moss over-grown-Trees are there? How many others Bark-bound; Bark-Pil'd, Cancker'd, full of Galls and Freters? and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64535:44"/>
many more evi's, which are caused either by the first planting, or want of dressing, or both; all which may be prevented by a careful and skilful Gardner: Nor are these casualties incident to an Orchard only, but all-other Woods, be they great or less.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If there be many Tops on one Tree, and that you would have it grow for long Timber, then may you take off all but the Principal Top, and follow him up by Lopping his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Boughes, as before directed: But, if you would not have the Tree grow high, but great in Bulke, and well spread in Boughes, then must you nip his top, or take it off.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If you find your Plants or Trees grow generally streight, and that those few that are crooked prove not useful, you may reforme them, or bring either their Body or Boughes to what forme you please if you begin betimes with them: Now the manner and way of performing this is better to be done then demonstrated, because the instrument that is to be imployed must be framed and fashioned answerable to the bent or crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness of the Timber you have occasion so to alter. There are other observations about the Dressing or Proyning trees, these already spoken of being to be understood of young Plants not greater in body then a mans wrist, but the same Rules may be observed in older Trees, so that the Boughes that are to be cut off be not bigger then as aforesaid; for there is no refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Trees that are greater without much skill and labour; and the wounds being great must have Plaisters laid on them; As for Galls, Cankers and Fretters I know no better cure then to cut-off the Bough as before mentioned: Thus considering the great hazard, labour and charges you put your self unto by transplanting great Trees, also by suffering the Woods of Trees that are already planted to grow out of order for want of timely dressing when they were young; the best way to prevent it for the future is to follow some of these directions I have offered, and not persist in an error wilfully upon no other ground then because our Ancestors have done so before: if your Trees are
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64535:45"/>
Mossy it proceeds from Poverty of the ground, which is one of the greatest causes also of their not thriving; And if Corn and Grass spend the fatness of the Earth, and will not thrive without a supply by Soile or Dung, much less can trees that have such great bodies be sustained without some additional helpes; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when your trees are grown great, and have spread the ground, you ought to lay good store of dung, yet according to the quantity of the Trees, and strength or weakness of the earth, you must add more or less compost: If all these Rules afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said were well observed and performed, <hi>England</hi> would abound with the best trees in the World, both for sound, long-liv'd, and long-lasting timber, and recover the Wastes that have been made, not only in quantity, but goodness and greatness. In the History of the West-Indies there is mention made of a tree, whose trunk or Body was 87 foot about, which is 29 foot Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter: It is my opinion there have been trees of as great a bulk or body growing in <hi>England,</hi> for I have been informed of an Oake that was feld in <hi>Hampshire</hi> about nine years since, which did contain in timber and Wood fifty Load: Also of one Arme of an Oake, growing not far from <hi>Horsham</hi> in <hi>Sussex,</hi> that was in the year 1664 blown down by Winds, containing thirteen Load of Wood and Timber; And I measured the 26th of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> 1664, in the Forrest called <hi>Ales-Hoult,</hi> an Oake now growing, whose trunck or body contains 36 foot compass, which tree was girded or measured about five foot high from the ground; the Diameter thereof is 12 foot: And, by many credible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports there have been greater trees in <hi>England</hi> then any now growing; for the best timber-trees become alwayes a Prey to such as know their use and profit. Now if such great trees which have been growing in <hi>England</hi> did so far exceed in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and greatness the generality of our best Timber-trees now living and growing, which trees by the opinion of most Men are many hunnred years old, and yet have not lived a third part of their age. These great trees then, if they had been careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lookt unto by orderly dressing, proyning and soiling, might
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64535:45"/>
have grown to twice their bulk and greatness, and have lived, if not cut down, many hundred years yet to come. It is my opinion, that there are Oaks now living and growing which were Trees and Plants growing from seed, or as suckers from the roots of trees the next Summer or Spring after the Deluge; and I think I may truly say some were the production of the earth, and grew by the Command of God at the first Creation, not destroyed by the Flood: and there may be many reasons for this my opinion: First, Trees are an Ornament to the Earth, and are to the Earth as the hairs of a mans head, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out poison, intemperance, or some other forcible cause, will dure with the body. Mans dayes are now much shortned by reason of sin; for before the Flood we read the Age of men to be above 900 years: and although <hi>Adam</hi> by his transgression was the cause of our Mortality, yet we have encreased the Curse by evil Government, and are become degenerate from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Diet of our fore-fathers. The men of those dayes did live, and increase in all lust, idleness, gluttony, and drunkenness, answerable to this wicked Age; no marvail then if thousands or millions of men die before they have lived the tenth part of their age. But an Oak is a plant of solid substance, feeding naturally as from the beginning, capable of, and subject to any kind of dressing, that shall be applyed unto it; not subject to diseases occasioned by intemperance, as in Man; And although for Mans sins the Earth was cursed to bring briers and thorns, yet we do not read that the lives of Vegetives were therefore shortned, but that every Plant according to the spirit of the species, by the good will and providence of God, lives to the time first appointed at the Creation: If Man had not sinned he had not been subject to mortality; it is therefore resolved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good reason, that Trees may live during the world, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the dissolution of all things here below, not coming under Mans transgression; for if Man, whose body is nothing in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner but tender rottenness, hath lived above 900 years, much more may the Oak live many thousand. But secondly, in all
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64535:46"/>
ancient History we read that the greatest part of <hi>England</hi> was much over-grown with Woods, and it is well known that these Woods have been cut down and destroyed in all Ages, and are wasting to this day: But we do not read of planting any, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in these latter dayes by Gentlemen for their private occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: His Majesties Forrests, which are the ancient Woods and Woodland in <hi>England,</hi> have not been planted, nor ever were by Man; neither do we find that the oldest trees die and young grow up in their room, nor that decayed trees are cut down except some few for Firing, but the best and soundest trees, as hath been said before; or that such old like decayed trees are the oldest trees; and are so decayed by reason of age, but chiefly by being often lopped, shredded, chipt and cut, either boughs or roots, or by other accidents, as being overwhelmed and oppressed by bushes or other trees growing too near them or otherlike, which may shorten the life of the soundest trees, besides other incumbrances under ground, as Land-springs, Water-courses, Rocks of Stone or Slate, which they meet with in their subterranous passage. Thirdly, there are trees which are and have been ancient Boundary trees, or Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks many hundred years, which now are and have been by the memory of the oldest men living growing like trees. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it hath been my observation in travelling abroad, that great Woods, or Woods of great Timber-trees have been so environ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Bogs or moorish ground, that not any Engin, Cart or Wagon could pass; neither hath it been known that any of those great trees have been felled or cut down: Other Woods I have seen containing many miles very rocky, and they so high and rugged, that not any Cart or Wagon could pass in many places, and yet both these grounds abounding with trees of great bulk; also other parts of the Country have been general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly full of Wood and Timber-trees, and not much peopled, nor ever was: Neither is there any Cart, Wagon, or other Engin thereabout in use to convey away Timber: And the Wood and Timber generally used is young trees, with which they
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:64535:46"/>
build their Cabbins, Booths or Houses, being but of one story, framed in the Woods, and drawn to the places where they make use of them, being made fast on both sides of a horse, or else carried on mens backs: I have travelled through a great part of these Woods, and as I well remember, the greatest part or quantity of the dead trees I then saw were such as the wind blew down, many of them lying rotting on the ground for want of use, the Country being full; and others that were standing, but dead, I found were for the most part young trees, which did either grow out of the roots of greater trees, or from seed falling in long grass, and so growing altogether hindred the growth of each other, and shortned their lives. I do not know any History that mentions either the planting, felling, or cutting any of these Woods, nor the oldest man then living in those parts could inform me. Fifthly, of my own knowledge in <hi>Lancashire, Shropshire,</hi> and other parts, there are many Firre-trees taken out of the ground, some of them 2 or 3 yards within the ground, and by all probability they have lien there ever since the Flood; for no History, nor any Lease Conveyance or Deed in writing doth mention any such trees growing in those parts: also they are found near the sea in moorish places, which is not a proper place for the Firr to grow in: there have been many years since and of late several discoveries of the said trees being found whole Bodies and Roots, and the Timber very sound: Now if such trees have dured found so long after death, much longer might they have lived if they had had the benefit of the earths moisture in their Roots only. There may be several reasons for that which hath been said of the Firre-trees, I shall but mention one: At the Deluge the Waters continuing many Moneths on the earth did much soften and mellow the ground, and at the time appointed by the Command of God the waters were return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into their Channels by a strong wind, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. <hi>verse</hi> 1. which said wind, after the waters were something asswaged, did blow down several trees: The Firre being tall, and the Roots running shallow within the earth, were the sooner blown down,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64535:47"/>
and left floting on the water by reason of their porousness and lightness. Now when the Waters were totally asswaged, where the last winds left them, there those trees sunk into the Mud, and every Tyde from the Sea casting up earth or sand did cover them; and the Sea in after time falling off or leaving those shores, that earth became dry, and produced grass, moss, weeds and such like, which did grow over and hide those trees untill such time that this Kingdom became more peopled, and then these trees were discovered as aforesaid: Many more proofs there are which much strengthens my belief in that which hath been said concerning the age of an Oak: But thus have we in a plain way and experimental, given helps and directions for the planting Timber trees: many more observations might have been added in the choice of seed and plants; the several wayes of planting, plowing, delving, sowing, and setting; the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent wayes of dressing and proyning; also the several sorts of Timber trees, besides those before mentioned; all sort of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwoods with their names and characters: But they being out of my Road at this time, I shall keep to my business, and in the next place give an account of the charges and profit in plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thousand Acres of Land. Now the best Figure for this Plot of Land for profit and pleasure is a Quadrat or four square of equal angle, because it encloseth a greater quantity of Land with less charges then you can do in any other Figure; also the Plants may be planted uniformly and in order: To perform this there must be provided two Chains made of Wyer, each of them containing 22 yards, which is 4 pearch, the breadth of an acre of Land, as it is usually measured; for 40 pearch long and 4 broad is an Acre; but if Woodland measure, then the Chains must be 24 yards in length; one of the said Chains must be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into 16 parts by 15 brass Rings, such as are used about Curtains, the said Rings to hang loose in that part of the wyer that joyns the links together; this performed the distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Rings will be one fourth of a pearch which is of Land measure 4 foot 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; inch, but of Wood measure 4 foot 6 inches.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64535:47"/>
At each end of this Chain would be an iron wyer Ring 2 or 3 times the compass of the brass Rings: With this Chain all seed or plants which are to be set at one pearch, two pearch, three pearch, four pearch, half a pearch, and one fourth part of a pearch distance, may be orderly and speedily set or plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and that you may readily distinguish between the parts of the Chain, at the one fourth part of a pearch must be a single Ring, at the half of the pearch 2 Rings, at one pearch distance 3 Rings, and at the middle of the Chain, which is a Pearch, 4 Rings: but to plant at these distances you may also make use of a streight Pole containing one pearch in length, and divided into four parts. The second Chain must be divided into yards and feet by brass Rings, as in the first Chain; it will require 65 Rings, being the distance of feet; and at every third foot, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at one end of the Chain, add one Ring more, there will then be two Rings, which is the distance of yards: this being finished, the single Rings distinguish the feet, and the double the yards, the Chain containing in length 66 foot and 22 yards; but if wood measure, then the length of the Chain will be 72 foot and 24 yards: with these two Chains you may plant Seed and Sets at all the distances mentioned in the Book. Now if you will not be at the charges to provide Chains, then may you make use of small Cords or Lines; and instead of Rings there may be knots with several coloured raggs at all the distan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces before mentioned; and if these Chains or Lines be not of a sufficient length to dispatch much work, then may you leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then them according to your use or pleasure.</p>

               <head>The Argument.</head>
               <p>You have Directions to plant a thousand Acres of Land, Woodland measure, 18 foot to the Pearch, with Seed and Sets for Timber-trees and Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods at the several distances before mentioned; and that is from one foot to four Pearch. Also here is set down the particular and total accounts of the Charges and Profit of planting the said Land by plowing or delving, and sowing or setting the same with Seed or Sets: As also of converting the said Woods to several uses.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>VVE have formerly discoursed of the knowledge of several sorts of Land by their Characters and Constitutions; also of the Clime or Continent where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they lie, and how you shall make choice of Land for planting Trees; the choice of seed and plants; the seasons for plowing, sowing, and setting; transplanting trees of great growth, with the several Distances of ground between the Plants; and the Improvement of one Acre of Land several wayes; and to plant with Seed and Sets for Timber-trees and Under-woods; therefore shall not trouble you with repetitions, but proceed.</p>
            <p>Suppose therefore the thousand Acres of Land before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64535:48"/>
to be totally planted, extending to the outmost bounds as it was measured without the Fence, it contains 160000 pearch at 18 foot to the pearch. In the planting this ground we shall mention only 5 several distances between the Plants.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I. Dist.</hi> The first and nearest shall be one foot: at this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance you are only to plant seed for the procuring Plants to transplant other Lands: we shall suppose this thousand Acres also to be a strong rich earth; and every way qualified for the planting all sorts of Timber-trees: This Plot of Land then contains 400 pearch square, or 7200 foot, but will require 7201 Rows of seed or plants, and the whole ground will take up 51854401 single seed or plants.</p>
            <p>Now if you will plant at this distance with seed for present use and profit, my advice is to plant only these three sorts, that is to say, the Oak seed which is Acorns, the Ash-tree seed cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Ashen Keys, the Chesnut-tree seed or Chesnuts: There being an equal number or quantity of the three several sorts of Seed, set or planted, the Land will take up of Acorns 17284800, of Ashen-keyes 17284800, of Chesnuts 17284801. Now supposing that all these seeds grow and thrive, about three years after the planting they will be of a sufficient growth to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted. The Oak and Ash Plants may yield 18 pence the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, there being 345696 hundred, allowing five score to the hundred, which amounts to 25927 pound 4 shillings: of Ches<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut Plants there will be 172848 hundred and 1 Plant; and they may be worth two shillings and six pence the hundred, and will amount to 21606 pounds 1 farthing: The total summ that all the Plants amount to is 47533 pound 4 shillings 1 farthing: A good improvement if there were Markets or vent for so many.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II. Dist.</hi> But if at three foot distance you will reserve one of these Plants to grow for Under-woods, and that you leave them equally mixed as they were planted, then there will be for sale
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64535:49"/>
or to be sold of Oak and Ash 30726400 single Plants, or 307164 hundred, and at 18 pence the hundred amount to 23044 pound 16 shillings; of Chesnut 153632 hundred of Plants at two shillings six pence the hundred come to 19204 pound. The total summ for all these Plants amounts to 42248 pound 16 shillings; the remainder or the Rods or Plants reserved are 5764801, which about eight or nine years after from the time they were planted, you may fell or cut down, and convert them to their several uses thus; the number of Chesnut Plants is 1921601, the number of Oak Plants is 1921600, the number of Ash Plants is 1921601. From the Chesnut Plants may be chosen 214234 Rods of the size from 12 to 16 foot in length: for smart hoops commonly used about wet and dry Cask of all sorts; and each Rod being carefully slit will make two Hoops, worth, if delivered at <hi>London,</hi> six shillings the hundred, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing six score to the hundred; then there will be 428468 single hoops, and being reckoned by the hundred they come to 3570 hundred 68 hoops, and amounts at six shillings the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to 1079 pound 3 shillings 4 pence half-penny. There may also from the Chesnut Plants be gathered 1400566 Rods of the size from 6 to 12 foot long, which will make 2801132 single hoops, and they arise to 23342 hundred and 92 hoops, worth, if delivered as aforesaid, 4 shillings the hundred, they amount to 4668 pound 11 shillings 3 farthings: the total sum for the Chesnut hoops amount to 5739 pound 14 shillings 5 pence one farthing. Out of the Oak and Ash, containing 3843200 Plants, may be chosen 403700 Rods of the longer size from 12 to 16 foot, which may make, being carefully slit as aforesaid, 807400 hoops, worth, if delivered at <hi>London,</hi> 4 shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings the hundred; and there being of them accounted as the Chesnut by the hundred 6728 hundred and 40 hoops, they will amount to 1345 pound 14 shillings 8 pence. Also out of the said Oak and Ash plants may be chosen of the shorter size from 6 to 12 foot 2125900 Rods, which will make 4251800 hoops, worth at <hi>London</hi> three shillings the hundred, and there being of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64535:49"/>
them 35431 hundred and 80 hoops, amounts to 5314 pound 15 shillings: The total arising of Oak and Ash amouts to 6660 pounds 9 shillings 8 pence.</p>
            <p>These aforesaid hoops are generally used about Oyl or Wine Cask, Grocery ware, Brewers, and such like: but it may be objected that all or every Rod appointed for hoops, although carefully slit, yet may not make two hoops: Our answer is, That all the Plants or Rods growing in the said Wood, is not appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the making hoops; therefore out of the remainder of Rods or Stuff reserved for other uses, there may be more Rods chosen to answer the insufficiency of those Rods before appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or to make up the number of hoops according to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts. Now the Remainder of Plants or Rods, not made use of for hoops, are in number 1620401, of which although there may be many uses made of them, as to make Hurdles for Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds, brading of Walls, and the like; yet we shall not convert them to any other use than Firing, of which Rods therefore, and the offal of the hoops may be made 1464 hundred of Fagots, allowing five score to the hundred, and they being worth five shillings the hundred in the Wood, amount to 366 pound. The total Improvement of the thousand Acres of Land planted with the seed of Oak, Ash, and Chesnut at this second Distance amounts to 55015 pound one penny one farthing.</p>

            <p>From the Oak and Ash, there being 7686402 Shoots, may be chosen 859202 Rods of the size from 12 to 16 foot, which will make 1718404 Hoops, and arise to 14320 hundred and four Hoops, amounting, at 4 shillings the hundred, to 2864 pound one penny two farthings: Also from the said Oak and Ash may be chosen from 6 to 12 foot 5264000 Rods, they will make 10528000 Hoops, and arise to 87733 and 40 Hoops, which at 3 shillings the hundred amounts to 13160 pound: The totall for Oak and Ash Hoops amounts to 160024 pound three half pence: From the remainder of Shoots, which is 2176800, and the Offal of the Rods for Hoops may be made 398600 Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, which arise to 3986 hundred at five score to the hundred; they are worth in the Wood six shillings the hundred, and come in the whole to 1195 pounds 16 shillings.</p>
            <p>The totall Improvement by Hoops and Fagots at this second selling amounts to 28657 pound 19 shillings 5 pence half penny.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Cut.</hi> At the third Cutting of this great Wood, which may be about eight years after the second, you will find the sap hath put forth five or six shoots out of each Stock; and at the next or fourth Cutting or Felling, which will be about the term of 32 years from the first Planting, by reason of, or from the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and richness of the earth, the Stocks will encrease to such strength and greatness, that every one may produce ten or twelve Shoots more larger and of better growth than the former; for you may please to understand the often cutting of this Under-wood or Coppice (yet not oftner than hath been declared) will cause the roots to extend or spread themselves farther into the earth, and that will much increase their sap, and thereby they will be inabled to put forth speedy, streight, sound, and strong Shoots; alwaies observing that you make choice of a good year and the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64535:50"/>
best season when you begin to fell or cut the Stuff. We shall only give you an account of the last or fourth Felling, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our former Method shall reckon from the least num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which is 10. The remainder or the Plants left for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood were 5764801, and the Increase which the Stocks do now produce arise to 57648010 Shoots or Rods to be cut down. Out of the Chesnut then containing 19216004 Shoots, there may be chosen of the longer size from each Stock one Rod, which doth arise to 1921601 Rods, and will make 3843202 Hoops amounting to 32026 hundred and 82 Hoops, and worth at six shillings the hundred 9608 pound 1 penny: There may be chosen also of the shorter size from 6 to 12 foot 8000000 of Rods, which will make 16000000 of hoops arising to 133333 hundred and 40 hoops, and worth at 4 shillings the hundred 26666 pounds 13 shillings 4 pence.</p>
            <p>The total summ for the Chesnut Hoops amounts to 36274 pound 13 shillings 5 pence: The Oak and Ash Stocks, being in number 3843200, produce 38432000 Shoots or Rods to be cut down, and out of them may be chosen of the longer size Rods as before mentioned 2000000, and they will make 4000000 of Hoops, which arise by the hundred to 33333 hundred and 4 Hoops, worth at 4 shillings the hundred 6666 pound 13 shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings 4 pence: Of the size from 6 foot to 12 may be chosen also out of the Oak and Ash 16148005 Rods, which will make 32296010 Hoops arising by account as before to 269133 hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and 5 Hoops, and worth at 3 shillings the hundred 40370 pounds 3 pence.</p>
            <p>The total summ for Oak and Ash Hoops amounts to 47036 pounds 13 shillings 7 pence.</p>
            <p>Now although there may be many Necessaries of Husbandry gathered out of the Offal, as Rods to make Hurdles for Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; also thatching Houses, brading Walls, and the like; yet the quantity vented for such uses being so inconsiderable, we shall convert the Offal to no other use than Firing as before said. There may be then made of the 29578404 Shoots or Rods
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:64535:51"/>
that are not useful for Hoops, and the shreding of the 28069606 Rods converted into Hoops 226450<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The total Improvement at this fourth Cutting by Hoops and Fagots amounts to 90104 pounds 17 shillings.</p>
            <p>Now if we should proceed to another season of felling, the increase would overcharge the Markets, and bring the Prices for smart hoops down to so low a rate, that there will be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vent and more profit in converting the wood into Firing; also by that time the Stocks will begin to decline or decay, they being planted at too near a distance. But omitting that, we shall go on to consider of some other waies to improve the thousand Acres of Land to be planted as aforesaid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>III. Dist.</hi> The next or third Distance therefore formerly mentioned is at 4 foot 6 inches, which is the one fourth part of Pearch: This is the nearest Distance I would advize to plant Under-woods; for the more liberty the roots have to extend themselves, the greater nourishment they receive from the earth, which doth not only add many years to their time of living, but also much expediate and increase their growth, whereby they will be enabled to produce a more plentiful Crop for quantity, goodness and greatness at the time of cutting, then if planted at a nearer distance. And because the Oak is of a slower growth than the Chesnut, Ash, or Withey, and is not useful for Hop-poles, nor any sort of Hoops, but those called smart hoops; we shall therefore instead thereof plant the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>they, and leave out the Oak.</p>
            <p>This Plot of Land then will take up or require, there being but one single seed or plant planted at the distance aforesaid, of the Chesnut 854401 seed or plants: Of the Ash 854400 seed or plants; and of the Withey 854400 plants; for this kind of wood is not planted by seed. The Total of seed or plants to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64535:51"/>
be set or planted amounts to 2563201. Now it is to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, as was said before, that all these Plants grow and thrive, and then about 11 or 12 years after their planting they may all be felled or cut down: And in felling you must be carefull to cut off the Rod or Pole sloping smooth and close, leaving the Stem or Body of the Plant about 3 inches above the earth and not more, according to former directions; Out of the Chesnut may be chosen 600000 Hop-poles, of which, allowing 5 score to the hundred, arise 6000 hundred, worth in the place where they are felled, if they grow within 4 or 5 miles from any great quantity of ground where there are many hops planted, 14 shillings the hundred, and amount to 4200 pounds; from the Ash and Withey may also be chosen 954000 Poles, which arise to 9540 hundred, worth where they are felled, 12 shillings the hundred, and amount to 5724 pound.</p>
            <p>The totall summ for Hop-poles amounts to 9924 pound.</p>
            <p>From the Remainder of the Chesnut, which are 254401 Stocks may be chosen 63600 Rods for bark or ryne hoops, of the size from 10 to 13 foot long, they will make 127200 hoops, and counting six score to the hundred, arise to 1060 hundred, worth to be delivered at <hi>London</hi> 15 shillings the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and amount to 795 pound. There may likewise be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen from the Chesnut 190801 Rods of the size from 6 to 10 foot, which will make 381602 hoops, worth at the place afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said 10 shillings the hundred, there being 3180 hundred and 2 Hoops, amount to 1590 pound 4 pence.</p>
            <p>The totall summ for both sizes of Chesnut hoops amounts to 2385 pound 4 pence.</p>
            <p>From the Ash and Withey may also be chosen 24800 Rods of the size from 10 to 13 foot, which will make 49600 bark hoops, which arise by tale to 413 hundred and 40 hoops, worth 10 shillings the hundred, they amount to 206 pound 13 shillings 4 pence. From the Ash and Withy may also be chosen 730000 Rods of the shorter size from 6 to 10 foot, they will make 1460000 hoops, that is 12166 hundred and 80 hoops, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

worth 8 shillings the hundred amount to 4866 pound 13 shillings 4 pence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>The total summ for Ash and Withey bark hoops-amounts to 5073 pound 6 shillings 8 pence.</p>
            <p>The total summ for all the sorts and sizes of bark hoops a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to 7458 pound 7 shillings.</p>
            <p>The Shredding and Offal of Hop-poles and Hoops, with the rest of the Stuff cut down, will make 67280 shred Fagots, and allowing five score to the hundred, there will be of them 672 hundred and 80 Fagots, worth in the Wood 8 shillings the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and amount to 269 pound 2 shillings 4 pence 3 far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things.</p>
            <p>Now at this Distance the Land may be sowed with Corn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Plants for the tearm of 3 or 4 years and not rest; but you must be careful that after the 3 or 4 years Crops re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, the Land be made good again by laying on it great store of Soil or Dung; for if you weaken the heart of the Land by often plowing or delving, the Plants cannot thrive or grow to raise any profit: Also by making the ground poor, you will indanger the life of the Plants, and thereby lose all your char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. It is my opinion, that Corn sowed among or between the Plants the first three or four years after planting, will much help the thriving and growth of them, so that neither Corn or Grass grow nearer the Plants than one foot; for if you take a good and early. Seed season, the Corn will be grown to a great head or height before the coldest of Winter, and by that means keep the ground mellow, warm, and moist; and in the Summer will shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and shade the young tender shoots, which the Plants will put forth from the scorching Sun.</p>
            <p>Now the most proper seed for the ground considering the season of the year when the Timber seeds are to be set or sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is Wheat; and because Woodland measure makes a large Acre, which contains 920 square yards of Land more than the Statute Acre, or Land measure; therefore we cannot allow less than 3 Bushels of Wheat to be sowed on every Acre; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64535:52"/>
at this Distance the Plants will take up a great part of the Land, we shall therefore allow but 2 Bushels to an Acre, which comes to 2000 Bushels; the encrease thereof may arise to 20000 Bushels yearly, during such time the Land is sowed, as before mentioned: And for that the price of Wheat is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, differing more or less almost every Market day, we shall therefore value it to be worth one year with another 5 shillings the Bushel, which amounts, for the 20000 Bushels, to 5000 pound: From the yearly Crop of Wheat there will arise 1000 Load of Straw worth 5 shillings the Load, and 16000 Bushels of Chaff or Hulls, worth 3 pence the Bushel heap and thrust: the total summ for Straw and Hulls amounts to 450 pound.</p>
            <p>The totall summ of the whole Improvement at this first felling, and three years Crops of Wheat amounts to 34001 pound 9 shillings 4 pence 3 farthings.</p>
            <p>About the same time or tearm of years the last stuff was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to grow, this Wood may be cut again, and every Stock then will yield you 3 or 4 Poles or Rods, because these Stocks are almost twice the age of those which were cut for smart hoops, and therefore by consequence are greater, and have more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of sap.</p>
            <p>Eight or nine years after the second Felling you may receive a third Crop, which, if well husbanded, will yield or return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Purse above three times so much as the first did.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Cut.</hi> Now at the next or fourth Cutting, which may be about eight or nine years after the last, the Stocks being grown great and full, and in pride of sap, you will find 10, 11, or 12 Shoots on each Stock; we shall reckon upon 10, then there will be in the whole ground 25632010 Shoots or Rods. And because the Chesnut is of more worth than either of the other, we shall therefore substract and count the value of them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly.</p>
            <p>The number of Chesnut amounts to 8544010 Shoots or Rods. We shall suppose that each or every Stock one with

            <p>We shall also take from the Ash and Withy of each Stock 2 Poles, which will make 3417600 single Poles, or reckoned by the hundred 34176 hundred, worth at 12 shillings the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred 20<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>From each Stock of Chesnut, which are 854401, there may be taken 2 Rods for Bark hoops of the longer size formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; they will amount to 1708802 Rods, and make 3417604 hoops, which allowing six score to the hundred, will be found to be 28480 hundred and 4 hoops, worth at 15 shillings the hundred 21360 pound 6 pence: Of the said Chesnut Stocks may be taken 3 Rods from each Stock of the shorter size, from 6 to 10 foot long, and of them there will be 2563203 Rods; they will make 5126406 hoops, that is 42720 hundred and 6 hoops worth at 10 shillings the hundred 21360 pound 6 pence.</p>
            <p>The totall summ for Chesnut hoops amounts to 42720 pound 1 shilling.</p>
            <p>From each Stock of the Ash and Withey may likewise be taken 2 Rods of the longer size from 10 to 13 foot, <hi>viz.</hi> from the whole Plantation 3417600 Rods, which will make 6835200 single hoops, or accounted by the hundred 56960 hundred, worth at 10 shillings the hundred 28480 pound. From the said Ash and Withey may also be chosen from each Stock 2 Rods of the shorter size, and there will be found of that size 3417600 Rods, which will make 6835200 hoops, arising to 56960 hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and worth at 8 shillings the hundred 22784 pound.</p>
            <p>The Total for Ash and Withey Bark-hoops amounts to 51264 pound.</p>
            <p>The totall summ for all the sorts and sizes of Bark-hoops a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to 93984 pound 1 shilling.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:64535:53"/>Of the Remainder of Shoots or Rods, which are 9398403, and the Shredding of the 16233607 Hop-poles &amp; Hoops, there may be made 2000000 of shred Fagots 4 foot long, worth in the place where they are cut 8 shillings the hundred, and counting 5 score to the hundred, they arise to 20000 hundred, which amounts to 8000 pound. Of the other Offal or remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of stuff may be made 264800 Brush Fagots worth in the Wood 6 shillings the hundred, and there being of them 2648 hundred, they amount to 794 pound 8 shillings.</p>
            <p>The totall Improvement by Hop-poles, Bark-hoops and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots at the fourth Felling amounts to 135245 pound 13 shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shillings 3 pence farthing.</p>
            <p>Now because in some Countries there may be good Land for planting these sorts of Wood, which yet being far remote from Markets have no vent for the Production, as Hop-poles, Hoops, &amp;c. And the transportation being so chargeable, that like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good staple and vendible Commodities in other parts of the World for want of that convenience they happen to be but of little profit to the Owners: We shall therefore count what the profit of Woods planted in this Thousand Acres will be, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting it only to Firing, and other Necessaries useful in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; for Timber and Under-woods are so generally wasted and destroyed every where, especially in this Nation, that it is hard to judge where there is no want.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Fell.</hi> At the next or fith Felling of this great Wood, which because we would have it grow to a good scantling or substance, may be about 14 years after the last Cutting, the stocks being by that time more increased, and the sap having put forth at least 15 or 16 Shoots, using our former method, we shall take the least number, then there will be by reason of the increase from the 2563201 Stocks 38448015 Shoots or young Trees cut down, out of which number there may be made choice of 200000 of the greater and streightest, the lower or but end of which being cut off from 8 to 11 or 12 foot long,

there may be made 2 white hoops from each end, containing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 3 inches broad, &amp; in thickness 3 quarters of an inch on the back or sap edge, &amp; a quarter of an inch on the heart edge, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Bastard hoops; the number of them will be 400000, which arise to 333 hundred and 40 hoops; they will be worth 500 pound: From the said Butt ends may likewise be made 333 hundred and 40 hoops of the narrower size, about 2 inches broad, which may be worth 20 shillings the hundred, and amount to 333 pound 6 shillings 8 pence. There may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so be chosen from the wood felled 500000 Butt ends of a shorter size from 5 to 8 foot, of the breadth and thickness of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, each end will make of both sorts 4 hoops, the number then is 2000000; these are worth both sizes one with the other 10 shillings the hundred, and there being 16666 hundred and 80 hoops of them, they amount to 8333 pound six shillings 8 pence.</p>
            <p>The total summ for White hoops amounts to 9166 pound 13 shillings 4 pence.</p>
            <p>Out of this Fall of wood may also be chosen from each stock of the Chesnut 2 Rods, which will make Bark hoops of all the sizes from 6 to 13 foot; then there will be made of the 1708802 Rods 28480 hundred and 4 hoops, they being most of the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest size, and all of the best sort of Bark hoops, are worth one with the other 13 shillings the hundred, which amouts to 18512 pound 5 pence.</p>
            <p>The Ash and Withey may likewise yield from each Stock 4 hopes of the size aforesaid, there will then be of them 56960 hundred hoops worth 8 shillings the hundred, and amounts to 22784 pound.</p>
            <p>The total summ for all sort of hoops amounts to 50462 pound 13 shillings 9 pence.</p>
            <p>These White and Bark hoops are commonly used by Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Coopers about small brewing Vessels, also for hooping all sorts of set work: As for those best sorts of White hoops that are five or six inches broad, and worth nine or ten pound the

hundred; they are made of greater grown Timber than these Woods will afford at so few years: But we shall have occasion to speak of them hereafter, and therefore forbear further men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of them in this place. There remaineth to be felled or cut down besides, or more then those used about hoops 32621613 Shoots or young Trees: Out of them may be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen from each Stock 12 single Billets, or so many as contain 12 notches; for according to the Statute every Billet should be 3 foot long, and 7 inches and a half in compass; and if the stick be great to bear 2 notches, the compass must be 10 inches, and if 3 notches, then the compass must be 14 inches; and so increasing as the Billets are in greatness. The number of Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets chosen is 30758412: there goeth to one Load of these 500 notches or single Billets, then there will be 61516 Load three quarters and 37 single Billets, worth in the Wood or place of felling ten shilling the Load, which amounts to 30758 pound 8 shillings and 1 penny 3 farthings. There may also be made from each Stock 6 Ostra Fagots which would be 3 foot long, and in compass 24 inches; they ought to be round and not flat, for so they are much less, though all one compass. Of these Fagots there will be 15379206, and counting five score to the hundred, they arise to 153792 hundred and 6 Fagots, worth in the place where they are made 5 shillings the hundred, in the whole 38448 pound 3 pence half penny. From the remainder of Shoots, and the offal of the Hoops and Billets may be made 2000000 of shread Fagots 4 foot long, worth 8 shillings the hundred, there being 20000 hundred, amounts to 8000 pound: from the Offal of the shread Fagots, and the other Brush stuff, may be made 225400 Bavins or Brush Fagots, worth 6 shillings the hundred, and there being 2254 hundred of them, their summ amounts to 676 pound 4 shillings.</p>
            <p>The total Improvement at this fifth season of felling amounts to 126992 pound 10 shillings 2 pence farthing.</p>
            <p>At all the after Fellings the growth of this Wood will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very time greater, and the Shoots more in number than the

last; for these Stocks will grow and thrive above an hundred years.</p>
            <p>Now at the next or seventh season of felling, the Product of this Wood being converted to the best advantage, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn or be worth 200000 pound. Let no man think this to be strange; for when Seed or Plants are planted at such a distance as the roots may have room and liberty to spread and enlarge themselves, and that the Shoots or young growth have Air and Sun, also all incumbrances removed and taken away, such Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwoods or Woodland shall be of more worth by the Acre than 12 Acres of ordinary Copices, Groves, or Vnder-woods; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have not set too high a rate on the Stuff or worth of Wood, prized as aforesaid; neither counted the utmost Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction or Increase of growth. We have many examples in Fruits and Herbs, that are planted in Orchards and Gardens, how far they exceed others of the same kind both in laregness and goodness, as well as in tast, smell, colour, &amp;c. that grow wild, so called because they proceed from the earth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of Man.</p>
            <p>Now although Nature is before, and to be laid as a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Arts, yet Nature is the better perfected by Art, because Art doth nothing but by the strength of Nature; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm your faith we shall give an account what this Land amounts to by the year for each or every Acre: You are to take notice the Wood is allotted to grow 14 years, the profit then made when those years are expired amounts to 200000 pound, which is 14 pound 5 shillings 8 pence half penny yearly profit for eve-Acre of the thousand Acres. In <hi>Holland</hi> there is Land hath been sowed with Flax seed, and the Crop thereof hath been worth fifty pound the Acre; but we shall come nearer home: There is Land in <hi>England</hi> sowed with Wheat, that has yielded at Harvest 2 Load upon an Acre, which is 80 Bushels. Now this Wheat, if sold at the price Markets have given for 3 or 4 years past, which was 8 shillings the Bushell, then the profit of the Acre by the year comes to 32 pound, which is above double
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:64535:55"/>
the profit of the Woodland: Suppose this Corn-Land yield but the one half of the former Increase, which is 40 Bushels of Wheat upon one Acre, then it comes to 16 pound. Again, if the Land should yield the first Increase, and Wheat sold for 4 shillings the bushel; for commonly great Crops or a plentiful Harvest cause low Markets: yet then this Acre of Land is worth 16 pound yearly. This may be sufficient to satisfie any reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable man: We shall return to our Work. Now because it is a general Custome in <hi>England</hi> at the felling of under-Woods, to reserve young Eats or Standils to grow for Timber-Trees; therefore in such Woods you are not to leave them at a nearer distance than 4 Pearch, which is 72 foot; for if you leave them nearer, the said Trees will destroy and much hinder the growth and thriving of the under-Woods, as hath been formerly declared. Thus much may serve to have here spoken for the first, second, and third Distance of ground between Plants, also planting under-woods.</p>

Dist.</hi> The next or fourth Distance is one Pearch or 18 foot; At this distance there may be digged or delved a Plot of ground either square or round, the quantity to contain 4 foot square, or 16 foot of ground: At each point or corner, or in the middle of the square sides, must a Seed or Plant be planted either of Chesnut, Ash, Beech, or Elme; and if you plant of all these kinds an equal number, there will then be 160801 square Plots, and 160801 Plants of each kind, which amount in the whole ground to 643204 plants; these may all grow 30 or 40 years more or less time as there may be use for them, or so long as every Man may please who shall be the Owner. At so near a distance the Trees will not grow great in body as when they have more room, but streight, slender, and tall; also they will have very few and small boughs grow on the insides that are opposite each to other. To make these Trees grow in bulk or greatness; when they are grown to that heighth which is best for your occasions, then nip or cut off their heads or tops.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:64535:56"/>
Now about 30 years after planting, the three fourth parts of these Trees would be grubbed or cut down, that the remainder reserved for greater Timber may have the more room, air, and sun on all parts: (And in felling) the former distance must be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served between them that are left standing: those Trees that are felled may be converted to their several uses as followeth. The Butt or lower end of the streightest Ash and Chesnuts that are best to slit, must be made choice of for white hoops, the size from 9 to 13 or 14 foot long: These hoops being of the best sort are to be made 5, 6, 7 inches broad, one inch thick on the back or sap edge, and about half an inch thick on the other or heart edge; they are worth, if delivered at <hi>London,</hi> 9 pound the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. One end or length of the said young trees may make 10 good hoops, and 12 trees or ends will make one hundred, allowing six score to the hundred: Now the remainder of the said trees and the Offal of them which were felled for hoops, may be converted to several uses. The Chesnut is good Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for building Houses, also for Quarters much used by Joyners and Frame-makers about Stools and Chairs, Chests, Boxes, Bedsteds, and such like: both the Chesnut and Ash are very good to make Wagons, Carts, and many other necessaries of Husbandry: But it would spend much time in speaking to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular; we shall therefore value the Chesnut and Ash, one with the other, to be worth 10 shillings the Tree, there being 241202 Trees, they amount to 120601 pound. The Elme and Beech being slow growers, will not be in so short a time of a sufficient greatness for extraordinary uses; Out of the Beech may be made Fellows, Axes, and Spokes for Cart-wheels, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for Joyners, and Building, used as the Chesnut; also Bowls, Trayes, Dishes, Trenchers, and such like. The Elme will not be of that greatness to serve about building Ships of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny considerable burden, but for small Vessels, as Hyes, Ketches, and such like; as also Pipes to lay under ground for the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of water, much used in and about <hi>London</hi>; they may likewise be serviceable to Mill-wrights for making and repairing Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mills;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64535:56"/>
also to other necessary uses may both these sorts of wood be imployed, so that they may be worth one with the other six shillings the Tree, and there being 241201 Trees, and being sold at the price, they amount to 72360 pound 6 shillings.</p>
            <p>The total summ for all the foresaid Trees amount to 192961 pound 6 shillings.</p>
            <p>The Trees that were left standing are in number 160801; now if they be carefully proyned and lookt unto, about 70 years growth, the Ash and Chesnut may be worth 30 shillings the Tree one with the other, and there being of them 80401, they amount to 120601 pound 10 shillings.</p>
            <p>The Elm and Beech about that time may grow to be worth 20 shillings the Tree, the Elme being of substance to be used about the Hulls and Keels of small Ships; also for Naves for Wagons, and Cart-wheels; many other uses may likewise be made of them: The number of both sorts is 80400 Trees, and they amount to 80400 pound.</p>
            <p>The total of all the 4 sorts of Trees amounts to 201001 pound 10 shillings.</p>
            <p>The 3 years Crop of Wheat with the Hulls and Straw, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our former reckoning do come to 16350 pound.</p>
            <p>The total of the whole Improvment by this way of plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the fourth Distance, amounts to 410312 pound sixteen shillings.</p>
            <p>Now all men do not approve of planting Under-woods with or among Timber Trees, nor that Trees should grow so near together, as in this last planting; neither is it convenient that all Woodland should be so planted; for at so near a distance they do not only hinder the growth of each other, but also take up much land, which may otherwise be employed for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Corn and Cattel; and therefore this Distance of one Pearch is too near for great Trees; yet in planting Seed or Plants there must be care taken that the distance of them be such, that every Tree be not a noyance but a help to his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, as not to hurt one another by any touch either of bough
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64535:57"/>
or root, and yet not so far asunder but that they may shroud each other from the cold and winds; therefore at this distance you may set your Plants, and when they are grown great, or come so near as to hurt by any touch, then may you cut, fell, or grub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>up the middle Tree, and you will have the greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Land either to plow, mow, or for pasture.</p>
            <p>We shall now proceed and treat only of planting the Oak at one Rod distance: Then may be digged or delved a Plot of ground 2 foot square; in the middle of the said Plot you are to plant 3 Seed or young Plants a foot distance one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and about 2 years after the planting one of the best Plants is to be reserved as a Standil or Storer, and the other 2 must be pulled or drawn up, and disposed of either to plant other grounds, or bestowed on your poor Neighbours if you have not sale for them: In this Thousand Acres of Land there will be 160801 square Plots; in each of the said Plots is reserved to grow for Timber 1 Oak Plant: Now you may plow or delve the ground between the Plants, and sow with such Grain as will produce the best Crop; yet it must not be plowed above 3 or 4 years for fear of hurting the roots of the young Trees, but may be kept for Pasture or Meadow, and benefit made many years, if that you help the Land by soyling it with good Dung. These trees may all grow till the twigs of each tree touch their Neighbour; then must you grub up every middle tree, which will be the second, fourth, sixth, and so reckoning throughout the whole Wood, alwaies observing to leave standing the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Row of trees about the ground for several reasons, but for brevity sake we shall mention but three: First those Trees being accustomed to the cold will the better endure; Secondly they generally are the best growing Trees, because they have most room, therefore receive more nourishment from the earth to encrease their sap, and so consequently their growth: Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they shelter and succour the inmost Trees from droughth, cold, and winds; and the inmost Trees will shelter them on three sides. Now to proceed, these middle Trees must not be cut
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64535:57"/>
down or felled, as we taught before, because after the Trees are gone or removed, the Land may be plowed and sowed with Corn between the Trees, remaining as at the first planting, and for many more years, therefore they must be very well grubbed or stockt up that the roots may not grow again. The number of Trees that are to be stockt up is 79600: This Timber may serve for ordinary building, and out of it may be chosen small Ship-Timber, also Tree-nails of all lengths and sizes, which are commonly used about all Ships. There may likewise be made from these Trees Slip-boards, which must be of the Butt ends cut off 8 foot long, the said boards would be 8. or 9 inches broad, and between 2 or 3 inches thick on the sap edge; and one inch thick on the other or heart edge: These boards are to make hoops by joyning 4 or 5 more or less; they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly used about the greatest size of Brewing Vessels. Such boards are worth, delivered at <hi>London,</hi> ten pound the hundred. Out of this Timber may also be made Lathes of all sorts, and many other useful Implements of Husbandry. Now consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all these Improvements from the Oak, we shall value them to be worth one with the other 15 shillings the Tree, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to 59700 pound: the rest or remainder of trees, which are in number 81201, may be worth at 150 years growth five pound the Tree, which amounts to 406005 pound.</p>
            <p>The Land may be sowed with Wheat at or after the first planting three years together, and every Acre will take up, the trees being thus planted at this distance, 2 Bushel and a half, which amounts to, for the thousand Acres, 7500 Bushels; the product or increase of the said Wheat according to our former account, which is 10 bushels for one, comes to, for the 3 years Crops, 75000 bushels, and at 5 shillings the bushel, amounts to 18750 pound.</p>
            <p>The Straw and Hulls or Chaff; which will arise from the said Wheat, allowing for every Load or 40 Bushels of Wheat 2 Load of Straw, worth 5 shilling the Load, and 32 bushel of Hulls worth 3 pence the bushel heap and thrust, they both come to 1875 pound.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:64535:58"/>The total summ for the first Fall of Timber, and the 3 years Crop of Wheat Straw and Hulls, amounts to 80325 pound.</p>
            <p>The total summ of the whole Improvement, besides the 147 years Profit of the Land by Corn, Pasture, or Hay, amounts to 486330 pounds.</p>
            <p>An Oak well planted, drest, or proyned, and the Land well soyled with good fat Dung, will be greater and of more value at one hundred years, than those planted with or among Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods will amount to at 300 years.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>V. Dist.</hi> A fifth or the next Distance in planting the Oak is 2 Pearch, which is 36 foot: there will now be in the thousand Acres of Land at this distance 40401 trees, and you may make as much benefit of the ground either by Corn, Meadow, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture within a small matter as if there were not a tree there growing. But at 150 years growth this Distance will be too near; for the distance of ground between trees must be so far as two trees doth overspread. Now a tree that does thrive will spread about the time aforesaid 12 or 13 yards, which being added to 12 allotted to the opposite tree, makes 24 yards, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore about that time you must grub up the middle trees, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore directed: they may be worth 5 pound the tree, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 19800 of the said trees, amounts to 99000 pound: the rest or remainder of trees being in number 20601, at 220 years growth may be worth 8 pound the tree, which come to 164808 pound.</p>
            <p>Now at this distance there may be sowed between the Plants 3000 Bushels of seed Wheat, and that is 3 bushels allowed for every Acre, the increase of the said Wheat, according to our former reckoning amounts to 30000 Bushels, and the 3 years Crops after the same rate comes to 90000 Bushels, which at 5 shillings the Bushel is worth 22500 pound.</p>
            <p>The Chaff and Straw that will arise from the 3 years Crop of Wheat, counting 2 Load of Straw and 32 Bushels of Chaff from every Load of Wheat, and at five shillings the Load for
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64535:58"/>
the Straw, and three pence a Bushel the Chaff, comes to 2025 pound.</p>
            <p>The total summ for Wheat, Chaff, and Straw, amounts to 24525 pound.</p>
            <p>The Total of this Improvement, besides the 217 years profit arising from Corn and Cattel, amounts to 288333 pound.</p>
            <p>Now trees thus planted, which have indured cold and droughth in the tenderness of their age, must of necessity grow and thrive the best, or better than those growing thick; so that such Oaks may grow in a short time, compared with the years those trees do live, to be worth 20 pound the Oak valued one with the other. Then the 20601 Oaks last valued or prized, if they grow to this price, amount to 412020 pound: And the Total Improvement of the thousand Acres, besides the profit arising from Corn and Cattel, amounts to 675833 pound.</p>
            <p>Also at this last Distance there will be more room for the Plow, likewise the Pasture for Meadow and feeding will be swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more wholesome for Cattel, the shade and dropping of trees being an Enemy to Corn and Grass.</p>
            <p>And thus shall you have healthful and long lasting trees, whose tops will be great, the boal or body smooth, clean, and free from boyles, great and well coloured Timber, being well drest may grow 30 foot high, free and clear without knob or bough, bearing 2 foot diameter at the top or heigth aforesaid, within or about 150 years after planted; such Oaks will grow to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible price or value. Now if there were in <hi>England</hi> 20000 Acres of Land thus planted, they would be worth according to the last account of the thousand Acres 13516660 pound. This would be a good improvement for so many Acres of Land, which may well be spared without any damage either to the Gentry or Commons: And the poorer sort of People which depend on his Majesties Forrests, as Commoners, should have much help thereby, as hath been sufficiently declared.</p>
            <p>Now although this quantity of Land make a great sound, and seemeth to be too great for such a use, and may in the opinions
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64535:59"/>
of some be better imployed for Corn and Cattel, yet if we had no Wood in <hi>England,</hi> which every day sensibly decays with us, Corn and Cattel could neither protect nor warm us. Also this quantity of Land is but a small proportion to the many Woods that have been, and now are in <hi>England,</hi> but utterly wasted and decayed, being over-grown with Shrubs, Dwarf-trees, Bush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and such rubbish, which will not well serve for good Firing, and is of little worth or profit either to Rich or Poor, as hath been said: Therefore those Lands would be cleansed of all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances and new planted. But if Woodlands cannot be spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red because of the scarcity of Firing, there are other Lands that may; for by the General Maps of <hi>England</hi> it is found to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain 29568000 Acres of Land, besides that which is allowed for the High-waies: Out of this summ deduct 20 thousand Acres, their remain 29548000 Acres. Now that which is substracted is so small a Proportion to so great a Quantity, that it may with much safety be allowed; And to answer all Objections which may be made against this Plantation, there are very suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Gentlemen who will undertake to carry on and finish the Work, without putting either his Majesty or the Nation to any charge. We have formerly made mention of a Statute of the 35 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. for the Preservation of Timber-trees, wherein it was provided, That 12 Storers or Standils should be left upon an Acre at every Fall; whereby we may undestand that in those daies they were sensible of the decay of Timber: Now if at that time there had been the same care taken, and provision made for planting Timber-trees, according to the manner and way which we have now declared, or for preserving the young then growing, there would have been a sufficient supply, not only for present use, but what might have continued for many hundred years to come, whereby his Majesty might be readily furnished with Timber for building a far greater number of Ships than now he has, and have for the annual profit of what might be sold, a considerable summ paid into his Exchequer.</p>
            <p>We have considered the Benefit and Profit which doth arise
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64535:59"/>
out of the whole thousand Acres of Land planted with Timber-trees; I shall now give you an account what loss there will be of Ground, and so consequently of Plants and Trees, by reason of the fence; for the generality of inclosed Land doth not hold or contain the exact measure as they are set down in ancient Deeds before they were inclosed; as for example, If you lay out or measure 100 Acres of Land to be divided or inclosed into 5 several parts or Inclosures with a Ditch or Hedge, every Plot of ground will not contain 20 Acres within the Fence, but the Fence must be likewise measured and included: This being so easie to understand, it doth not require farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration.</p>
            <p>Now in the account of loss of ground we shall mention but 2 Distances, and they are 4 foot and a half, and 18 foot or one Pearch. The Fence appointed to enclose the thousand Acres of Land to be planted is a Ditch with a quick or White-thorn Hedge, the Ditch to contain in breadth 6 foot, and 5 foot in depth. Now the Bank or earth that is thrown out of the Ditch must lye within the Inclosure, which Bank although it be laid or cast round and handsome, yet will it take up or cover about three foot of ground, so that we must allow for Ditch and Bank at least 9 foot, which is half a Pearch, and so much less land we have to plant, which amounts in the whole Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to 799 square Pearch: Also the ground within the Fence, containing 399 Pearch square, will now require or take up at 4 foot 6 inches distance but 2544025 Plants, there being 19176 fewer Plants than the thousand Acres will require, planted at the uttermost extent without a Fence; therefore so much of the profit as the Plants deducted do amount to, must be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted out of monies received for Under-woods, which I have forme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly given an account of; then will you have the full pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Land planted within such a Fence. Now at the next or second Distance, which is 18 foot, the Land will tak up but 158404 Plants, so that the loss by the Fence at this distance does arise to 2397 Plants, and consequently so many Trees,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64535:60"/>
which must be deducted also out of the account of Profit for Timber-trees. This last Distance is too near the Fence, and will more hinder the Quick hedge from thriving than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Distance, although those Plants are much nearer, because they were planted for under Woods, and to be felled or cut down every ninth or tenth year, so that the Thorn Plants will have the benefit of the Sun untill the other Plants be grown great and over-top them, and by that time they will be ready to cut again: But the Plants preserved to grow for Timber-trees, after they are grown great will by much shading and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten dropping on the Hedge, decay the same; and the older these trees grow, the more ground they will require, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prove greater enemies unto the Fence.</p>
            <p>By this which hath been spoken concerning the loss of ground by reason of the Fence, may be understood my meaning in a former Section, where it is said, that what distance of ground is left between the uttermost Row of Plants and the Fence, according to the distance of Plants, there must be so many Seeds or Plants deducted from the number planted in the whole extent of land without the Fence. But this may be sufficient to shew the loss of land by reason of the Fence; and wherein by the way take notice, that it is not profitable to make small Inclosures, except for drayning of land, or some other special occasion.</p>
            <p>I have endeavoured to give a true account of the Profit, or best way of Improvement of Land by planting Trees for Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Wood. Now if this little Address of mine towards the publick find a sutable success to that of the poor Widows, it is the Product of a good heart; and he that gives his all, may hope for acceptance with all: The want of fortune is a Remora to my will, in the service of my King and Country; therefore while I do what I may, 'tis agreeable to charity to accept the Will for the Deed; and that you may the better know to what advantage the Land is improved, we shall give an account of the Charges in planting; the particulars of some part thereof
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64535:60"/>
have been formerly cast up and brought to account, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall summs are as followeth.</p>
            <p>The Fence about this Great Wood, containing 1600 Pearch Wood measure, (which is 18 foot to the Pearch, for by that Rod, Pole, or Pearch are all the Hedges and Ditches measured) will require 86466 Plants, which at 4 pence the hundred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to 14 pound 8 shillings 1 farthing: The Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, in which is to be considered making the Ditch, setting the Plants, cutting and shripping the Stakes, drawing the Bushes, and making the dead Hedge, amounts to 225 pound 11 shillings 11 pence 3 farthings.</p>
            <p>The total Charge of the Fence besides, or not counting for Bushes and Stakes, amounts to 240 pound.</p>
            <p>Now if you intend to plow this Plot of land, or sow and set the same with seed for Timber-trees and under-Wood, if the ground be Pasture or Meadow, and not in Tillage, it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire 3 times plowing and harrowing; but in case the Land have been lately plowed and sowed, as at the last Seed Season, then twice plowing may be sufficient: And because we treat of planting Forrests and Wast land, they are supposed to be Pasture or feeding land; also strong stiff Soils, either Clayes, Sands, or Compounded, then will it require twice plowing and harrowing, and once hacking.</p>
            <p>Having formerly spoken of the manner and way how to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this part of Husbandry, we shall now compute the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the first years expence in the whole Plantation, which is as followeth: Twice plowing, harrowing, and sowing, to have it well done, will cost 10 shillings the Acre; A lusty Labouring man will hack a quarter of an Acre of the said plowed Land in a day, and deserve 12 pence for his dayes work, which is 4 shillings the Acre hacking.</p>
            <p>The total Charges for plowing, sowing, hacking and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing a thousand Acres comes to 700 pound.</p>

               <head>The First Distance.</head>
               <p>THe Seed which this Land will take up to be set or plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Acorns at one foot distance, the whole extent of the Land being planted, and not counting the loss of ground by the Fence, amounts to 51854401 single Acorns, or 8102 Bushels 1 Peck and 1 Acorn, according to my former account of 800 Acorns to every Gallon, and at 2 shillings the Bushel they come to 810 pound 4 shillings 6 pence: Now if you sow the Land with the same seed, then there must be 2 Bushels allowed for every Acre more than there was for setting, and the quantity to be is 10102 Bushels 1 Peck and 1 Acorn; they amount to 1010 pound 4 shillings 6 pence.</p>
               <p>The Charges for setting the Acorns, being formerly allowed at 4 shillings the Acre, come to 200 pound.</p>
               <p>The Charges for weeding the Plants, being also allowed at 10 shillings the Acre, come to 500 pound.</p>
               <p>The total Charge for Seed, also plowing, hacking, harrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, setting and weeding, amounts to 2210 pound 4 shillings 6 pence.</p>

               <p>But if the Land be planted by setting Ashen Keys, of this seed there go 96000 into one Bushel, and will cost 12 pence the Bushel, and the Land will take up 540 Bushel 1 Gallon, 1 pint and a half and 151 single seeds, amounting to 27 pound 7 far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things.</p>

the quantity to be provided comes to 1040 bushels 9 pints a half and 151 single seed, and they come to 52 pound 7 far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things.</p>

               <p>But if the Land be sowed with the said Nuts, then every A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre will require 1500 more than was allowed for setting: The whole number will arise to 533544 and one single Nut, and at 2 pence the hundred do amount to 4446 pound 4 shillings.</p>
               <p>The total Charge for setting or planting a thousand Acres of Land at a foot distance with Chesnuts, amounts to 5721 pound 4 shillings.</p>

               <p>To plant by setting a thousand Acres at a foot distance with Beech seed, called Beech Mast, there going 76800 single seed into one Bushel, the Land will take up 675 bushels 6 quarts and 1 seed, and at 3 shillings the bushel, according to a former allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, they amount to 101 pound 5 shillings 6 pence 3 farthings.</p>

                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:64535:69"/>Thus have we endeavoured to give a sufficient account of the first years Charges by plowing, sowing, setting, or planting seed or Plants in this Plot of good Land, being a rich Clay and moist Earth: But this must not be a Rule of Charges to plant all Lands by; for several Countries have several Prices in all Materials belonging to Husbandry; and as is the lightness and goodness, stiffness and badness of the Earth, so are the Prices more or less: In rich moist Sands or mixed Earths, which is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise good ground to plant such plants in, 2 Yoak of Oxen in such ground will plow more in one day than 4 Yoak in a stiffe heavy Clay or such kind of Earth. There are many wealthy Husbandmen in <hi>Hartfordshire</hi> that plow the greater part of their Land with one Man and two Horses, who both holds the Plow and drives the Cattel; and in other places one Man and three Horses will plow an Acre and a half in a day, when in the same Parish two Men and six Horses cannot plow so much: It has been my observation, that in Common Fields some Plows with 4 Horses make a better dayes work than others of a far greater strength, when yet there has been only the breadth of a lay Bank between them, and from no other reason but the several kinds of Earth.</p>
               <p>Now as we have given an account of the Charges in Planting by Plowing, Sowing, and Setting Seed and Plants for Timber-trees and Under-woods, I shall likewise give an account of the Charges in planting the same quantity of Land by Digging or Delving; as the labour of Man and Cattel in Plowing is more or less, according to the goodness or badness of the Earth; so is it likewise in Delving, a man will earn more by delving some Land for a penny the Rod; than other at 3 pence, yet both grounds alike plain and level, and without incumbrances: Also it is to be considered, that to delve for sowing Corn or ordinary seed, requires but one Spades grast in depth, but extraordinarily where the upper part of the earth hath been worn out, and that there is good earth deeper: also to cleanse the ground from stones, or strong weeds which have long roots and deep, or such
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:64535:70"/>
like annoyances, then it will require two Spades depth. There is no Plant that doth usually grow in <hi>England</hi> requires a deeper Mould than these we treat of; but because we suppose the Land that is made choice of to be a well qualified earth, we shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore adventure at one Spades depth to plant as aforesaid; and because it hath not been plowed or delved for many years past, or it may be never: also Woodland measure being very large, it is worth delving four pence the Square, Rod, Pole, or Pearch, allowing 18 foot to the Pearch, and one Pearch square contains 324 foot of ground. Having considered the charges in planting seed and plants by Plowing, and also given an account of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular charge as was thought needfull; we shall therefore in this following Account of Charges in planting by digging or delving not trouble you with many particulars, but as briefly as may be, speak to all those several Distances mentioned in our last Accounts.</p>

               <p>The reason why we allow a greater price by the perch for delving these square Plots mentioned in the last two Distances, than was at first when the whole Inclosure of Land was delved, is because these several parcels of Land require much more care and time than the other.</p>
               <p>Now if you intend to sow or plant Corn among the Plants at this last Distance, then the whole Inclosure of Land must be delved, for the Plow will not have room to turn between the Plants. In our former accounts of Charges for plowing the Land, the seed we made choice of, as the best Corn to grow among the Plants is Wheat, the quantity to be sowed upon one Acre was 3 Bushel: but because a great part of the Land is taken up for the Plants to grow in, there is but 2 Bushels allowed for an Acre where the Plants are planted at this distance. I shall give you only one Account of charges for Corn at this time, and likewise in each of the other two Distances we are to speak of.</p>

               <p>Now because this Woodland measure is larger than the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Acre or Land in Tillage, and the labour in sowing the Corn, Harrowing, Raking, Weeding, Reaping, Gathering, Binding and Loading will require much care and time by reason of the Plants growing so near together; therefore to make good the time and answer the care, in our accounts of Charges, we reckon the whole Inclosure of Land by the Acre, as if no Plants were growing therein.</p>
               <p>And you may please to take notice that this account of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges by Corn is not a Rule for all Countries, because the Wages
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:64535:77"/>
of Men and Cattel, and the prices of Corn do much differ, as was said before; yet we have gone as near the most usual rates as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly could be; and which may serve for most Shires and Counties in <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> being not within our List. Also the account of charges about Corn may be considered in, or added to any other account of charges, my meaning is, That if the Land be planted with seed of Trees, as Acorns, Beech-mast, or any other kind, the account of charges for Wheat may be added in the Total, thereby to know the charges of planting Wheat with the Seed of Trees. Secondly, where the Land is plowed and planted with Sets or Seed of Trees at any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance the account for Wheat may likewise be added to the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; and you will know the charges to plant Wheat when the Land is plowed, as where the Land is delved. This being easie to understand does not require farther demonstration; I shall now according to my former method give you all the Totals by themselves for Sets, Seed, and Corn planted at this distance.</p>

               <p>This Account of Charges by sowing Wheat among the Plants does rise to so great a summ, that it may discourage a young Planter; but if his patience would guide him to the account of profit or improvement, there may be hopes of incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment again: And that no miscarriage may happen in so good a work, I shall in this place state the Account of Charges and Profit by planting Sets and Wheat in a Thousand Acres of Land, and the Plants planted 4 foot 6 inches distant one from the other.</p>
               <p>In Page 89 and 90 the total summ of Improvement by Ash, Withey and Chesnut Plants planted at this distance last mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and allowing 10 or 11 years growth, amounts to the summ of 17651 pound 9 s. 4 d. 3 farthings. Also the Land sowed with Wheat 3 years together, and the yearly increase arising to 20 Bushels growing on every Acre, and being sold for 5-shillings the Bushel does come to 15000 pound; these two sums added
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:64535:78"/>
together, the Total amounts to 32651 pound 9 shillings 4 pence 3 farthings.</p>
               <p>Now there will arise from every Load of Wheat, which is five Quarters or 40 Bushels, 32 Bushels of Chaffe or Hulls; Then the 1500 Load of Wheat will yield 48000 Bushels of Chaff, worth in the Barn or place of thrashing 3 pence the bushel heap and thrust, which comes to 600 pound. Also every Load of Wheat will yield 2 Load of Straw, worth in the thrashing place 5 shillings the Load, and comes to 750 pound: Add all these sums together, and they amount to 34001 pound 9 shillings 4 pence 3 farthings.</p>
               <p>The first years charges in planting the single Sets of Ash, Withey and Chesnuts; also Wheat sowed as by the account in page 106 doth come to 6607 pound 18 shillings 8 pence far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>The land between the Plants must be twice delved, and may be as often sowed with Wheat, after the first years planting; whereupon all the former charges about the wheat also will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue 2 years more; and the land to be delved for the Wheat, there being 128355 perch a half and 14 foot, at 4 pence the perch, comes to 2139 pound 5 shillings 2 pence; and the next or third years delving amounts to the same summ, they both come to 4278 pound 10 shillings 4 pence farthing. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of land which is 31644 perch a quarter and 67 foot, is the land allotted for the Plants to grow in.</p>
               <p>The two years charge for seed-Wheat, also sowing, raking, weeding, reaping, gathering, binding and carting come to 2583 pound 6 shillings 8 pence.</p>
               <p>Now at 10 or 11 years growth all the foresaid plants must be cut down; the charges for cutting and converting them to their several uses, as shreading the Hop-poles, making the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, and such like, the workmanship may be worth 10 shillings the Acre, which comes to 500 pound. We shall also allow for making the hoops, and transportation of them, 12 shillings the thousand, and there being 1282 thousand and 2 hoops,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:64535:78"/>
comes to 1009 pound 4 shillings. We shall also allow for the Rent of the Land, and Interest for the forbearance of the Rent 7 years, there being no Interest allowed for the Rent during the 3 years time the land was sowed with Wheat, because of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Increase.</p>
               <p>Now the land is valued to be worth 20 shillings the Acre year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rent, then the 10 years Rent for the thousand Acres comes to 10000; pound the 7 years Interest for the said Land, after the rate of 6 pound <hi>per Cent.</hi> comes to 503 pound 12 shillings 6 pence 2 farthings.</p>
               <p>We shall also allow Interest for the moneys disbursed in plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and is as followeth.</p>
               <p>The Charges for Delving the Land which the Plants grow in, there being 31644 perch a quarter and 67 foot, at 4 pence the perch, comes to 527 pound 8 s. 1 d. ¾.</p>
               <p>The 10 years Interest for this last Sum of Charges after the rate of 6 pound <hi>per Cent.</hi> comes to <hi>369</hi> l. 15 s. 10 d. ½.</p>
               <p>The Moneys disbursed for Sets or Plants comes to 2649 l. 12 s. 1 farthing.</p>
               <p>The 10 years Interest for the Moneys paid for the said Sets, comes to 1896 l. 1 s. 5 d. ½.</p>
               <p>Now the Land between the Plants containing 128356 square perch is worth 10 shillings the Acre to ly for Meadow after the 3 years Crops of Wheat is off the Land, and there being 802 Acres and 36 Perch, comes to 401 l. 2 s. 5 d. yearly, then the 7 years Rent of the said Land, which is about the time of the first Cutting of the Plants, comes to 2807 l. 16 s. 11 d. This Sum is to be added to the account of Profit or Improvement; and the total Improvement then amounts to 36809 l. 6 s. 3 d. 3 farthings,</p>
               <p>The total Interest Money comes to 2769 l. 9 s. 10 d. ½.</p>
               <p>Now all these Sums of Charges before and last mentioned, being added to the total Sum for the first years Charges, then the Total of all Charges for the thousand Acres of Land, planted as aforesaid, amounts to 27748 l. 9 s. 6 d. ¾.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:64535:79"/>And if you substract this last total Sum of Charges out of the total Sum of Profit or Improvement, then the Product or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the Sum substracted comes to which Sum is so much gained out of the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Acres of Land in 10 or 11 years, the Land planted as we have formerly declared.</p>
               <p>I know not of any other Accounts of Profit or Charges worth the bringing or charging to an account in this place: But you may please to take notice that this Account of Gain or Profit is for the first Cutting of the Plants, they being single Shoots, Poles, or Rods produced from Seed. The next Cutting, or second Growth, every Stock may put forth 4 or 5 Shoots; and then the profit will be double. Also this way of planting by Sets, and delving the land is much more chargeable then plowing and planting Seed; for the total charge in planting at this distance with the Ash and Chesnut Seed, and Withey Sets, the Land plowed, and the Seed and Sets planted the way and manner as we have set down in Page 114 comes but to 1897 pound 9 s. ¼. But the total charge, the Land being delved, and single Setts, and the Seed of Ash and Chesnuts, with Withey Sets, as was said before, planted at the same distance, Page 136 and 137, amounts to 5316 pound 7 s. 4 d. 1 farthing; substract the Sum of Charges for plowing and planting out of the Sum for delving and planting, the rest or remainde amounts to 3418 pound 18 shillings 4 pence; and being so much charges saved by plowing and planting seed, may be added to the Account of profit as so much gained.</p>
               <p>Now it may be objected, that planting by Sets every Stock will produce 2 or 3 Shoots, and to plant with Seed there will be but one Shoot, and so consequently one Pole or Rod; and at the time or season of cutting the Sets will produce double the quantity of stuff more than the Seed: For answer we grant the increase; but say that the Sets which should be planted being small, the many Shoots may by hindering the growth of the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:64535:79"/>
Roots, and indanger the Stock, and also hinder the growth of each other; for the Root must have time to grow and inlarge it self within the earth; therefore there will not be a sufficient supply of sap to maintain more shoots than one in so short a time as is allowed to the first Cutting: Also for young Stocks to have many boughes will not only hinder the thriving of the root by spending much sap, but as a poor Ewe which may bring forth 2 or 3 Lambs, both sterves her self and those she brought forth: We shall therefore advise to proyn or cut off all shoots but one from every Stock, until after the first Felling or Cutting; for one good streight shoot is worth 5 or 6 small stragged ones. These particulars being premised, you shall have the account in brief; and it is as followeth.</p>

               <p>Now if at this distance in each Plot of ground you reserve to grow for Timber only one Plant, and pluck or draw up the other three, as has been directed; or that you plant one single Set at this distance, making use of the Plots by planting Corn therein; then the Land between the Plants may be plowed, and if sowed with Wheat, the quantity allowed for every Acre, counting as formerly, will be two bushels and a half; the Land then will take up, there being 950 Acres 59 pearch and 68 foot, 2375 bushels 2 pecks, &amp; at 5 s. the bushel amounts to 593 pound 17 shillings 6 pence. The Plowing of this Land according to our former accounts of Charges by plowing after the rate of 12 shillings the Acre comes to 570 pound 4 shillings 5 pence. At this distance we shall allow the Increase of Wheat to be 25 bushels growing on every Acre of Land.</p>

               <p>It may be objected that on those Lands where there is plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the least number of Sets, there ought to be a greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Corn sowed than where the Plants are set thicker, and consequently a greater Crop or Increase of Wheat expected; also an account given thereof, which is not performed or men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the accounts: For answer we say, That on those Lands where Corn is ordered to be sowed, there is but one Plant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to grow for Timber, and at the ends of each or every Distance of Land proportioned between the Plants: All the rest are appointed for planting other Lands, and to be pulled or drawn up at or about three years after the first planting. Secondly, in that short time or term of years the Plants will be but of small growth, therefore not much prejudice or hinder the growth of Corn; neither will the Corn hurt them if ordered as has been directed. Thirdly, the difference is so small, that I shall not blot paper by taking notice thereof; and to answer every Objection, nice Scruple, or Question, is more fit for such that delight rather in Disputation than Improvement: we shall therefore proceed, and according to our former custome give

               <p>We have not set down in all the Distance every particular Account of Charges or Expence, being unwilling to repeat the same thing over and over again; but refer the Reader to the Account stated in the third Distance, and Planting for Under-woods.</p>
               <p>All that hath been spoken of Planting; Also the Accounts of Charges and Profit are to be Understood as meant of the whole Land, or Utmost of the Plot, containing a thousand A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, the square whereof is 400 pearch.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:64535:86"/>We might also here give an account of the Charges and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit that may arise by Planting the said Land inclosed with the Fence before mentioned; the ground allowed for breadth of the Ditch and the Bank, or earth cast out for the thorns to grow in, was 9 foot, which is half a pearch; then the square of the Land within the Fence to be planted contains 399 pearch, and ariseth in the whole Plot by the acre to 995 acres one perch: The loss of land by reason of the Fence or the Land taken up by the Fence, being 4 acres 3 quarters and 39 pearch.</p>
               <p>Now the way and manner how this Plot or quantity of Land is to be planted, we have already declared, and by the compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of one single Acre and a thousand Acres, which I have demonstrated at large, may be known the Charges and Profit arising by planting 5, 10, 100, 10000, or any number of Acres whatsoever.</p>
               <p>I should here have concluded this most delightful Subject of Profit, acceptable, if not to all, yet to the greatest part of the World; notwithstanding to follow the advice of the Poet, who is willing that Pleasure also have a share in all discourses of this Nature, and to render my labour, if possible, agreable to such o're whom the first has no influence, unless accompanied with the latter: I shall endeavour by joyning both here, to make the Desart you have already past only appear as a rugged Entrance into the Pleasant Land; and by the Delights which I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in my Garden of Pleasure, hope to make you forget all the troubles and unevenness of your former passage.</p>

               <head>The Argument.</head>
               <p>In this Book are Directions set down how to plant 200 Acres of Land at well for Pleasure as Profit, wherein there shall be pleasant Walks with Timber-trees and Groves of Vnder-woods, and several Orchards and Gardens, with Fruit, Flowers and Herbs both for Food and Physick, variety of Fowl, Bees, Silk-worms, Bucks, Does, Hares, and other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of several kinds: And a short account of the Charges and Profit of keeping a thousand Doe-Conies in Hutches, the profit amounting to 450 pounds <hi>per annum;</hi> Also Fish-ponds and Streams of water stored with many kinds of Fish, and stocked with Decoy-Ducks; And the Vse and Vertues of all the Plants growing in this Garden of Pleasure.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe Figure of this Garden, or profitable and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Place, is a Quadrat, the 4 Angles or square sides lying South-east, North-west, South-west, and North-east, the length of one side or Angle containing 178 Perch 15 foot 11 inches: The whole Plot is to be inclosed with a Ditch and Quick hedge of White-thorn, as hath been directed, to fence in the great Wood: In the middle of this Garden containing 200 Acres Woodland Measure, that is 18 foot to the Perch in length, shall be erected a convenient Dwelling-house, and other usefull Buildings for Corn and Cattel; the Front of the said House to stand South-east,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:64535:87"/>
and the Scite thereof to be inclosed for Yards, Gardens and Orchards, we allow to take up 20 Acres.</p>
            <p>On the North-east side of this our Garden, and 36 foot from the Fence or outmost bounds, is to be planted to Row of Oaks extending to the ends of the said Angles or square Sides; but observing to keep the same distance of 36 foot from the Fence of the other Angles, or North-west and South-east Sides. This first Row of Oak being set or planted, allowing 21 foot of land between each Plant, there is to be planted another or second Row of Oaks 36 foot distance from the first, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the distance of 21 foot between every Plant in the said Row: This performed, then 36 foot from the last Row of Oaks is to be planted 2 Rows of Chesnut Plants, all of them keeping the same distance one from the other, as the Oaks; and 36 foot from the last Row of Chesnuts must be planted 2 Rows of Beech Plants; also 36 foot from the last outmost Row of Beech may be planted 2 Rows of Walnut Plants, the said Beech and Walnuts are to be planted at the same distance as was the Chesnuts; 4 pearch or 72 foot from the last Row of Walnuts you may plant a Grove or Thicket of White Thorn, the breadth to be one pearch, and the length extending as far as the Walnuts.</p>
            <p>From the Thorns, the space of land between being 9 foot, is to be planted a Coppice or Thicket of Ash and Withey Sets equally mixed; the breadth of the said Plot of Ash and Withey Plants must be 4 pearch, and the length 81 foot shorter at each end then the Thorn Thicket.</p>
            <p>Half a pearch or 9 foot from the Ash Coppice shall be plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 4 pearch of Land in breadth with Hazel-nut Sets, and the length to be the same as that of the Ash.</p>
            <p>Leaving 1 pearch or 18 foot space of ground from the Hazel Coppice, there must be planted the breadth of 4 pearch in breadth with Rasberry, Blackberry, Barberry, Goosberry and Currant Bushes; All these are to be planted equally in several Beds, and the edges of the said Beds planted with Strawberries.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:64535:88"/>The whole Plot being planted, and equally mixed with all the several sorts and colours of Berries, with convenient Walks between each Bed, and containing the same length with the Nut-wood.</p>
            <p>One pearch distant from the said Plot of Berries is to be plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the same length and breadth of land with Philberd Nut Sets.</p>
            <p>Keeping the distance of 9 foot from the last Plot planted, the next to be planted are Withey and Ash Sets, the length and breadth of the said Plot to be the same as was last planted with Philberds.</p>
            <p>Now as an Architect will lay a good foundation before he build, we have advised first to plant; and as the first Plot planted of this our Grove was a Thorn Thicket, so likewise must the last, or that opposite to the first; and also both ends of this entire Inclosure, observing to keep the distances with length and breadth of this last Thicket as that first planted; and also the Thorns planted at the two ends of the Grove must be of the same breadth, and joyn to the ends of the first and last Thorns planted.</p>
            <p>About the middle of the last or South-west side of the Grove, and opposite to the Dwelling-house must be left unplanted a space of Land or Ground, on which to build or set up a fair Gate for entrance into the Wood or Grove aforesaid; also there must be left unplanted 72 foot of Land in breadth, beginning at the said Gate or middle of the Thorn Thicket, and extending overthwart or cross, dividing the Grove, which will make a Pleasant Walk, there being erected a Fountain in the middle of the said Walk, whose streams dividing the Grove into 4 parts, will be of great use for the refreshing all things, as well Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and Sensitives as Rationals; and at each end of the said Walk is to be planted a Mulberry-tree.</p>
            <p>These Directions being observed and performed, on the South-west side of the House is to be planted the same quantity of Land with all the several sorts of Plants aforementioned,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:64535:88"/>
keeping the same distance of 36 foot from the Fence, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the same distance of Plants according to the manner and way of the first or North-east part of the Land planted.</p>
            <p>These two Groves and Timber-trees in them are not planted only for Pleasant Walkes, but Harbor and feeding places for wild Peacocks, Turkies, Pheasants, Blackbirds, Thrushes, Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fares, and all other useful Birds that live on such food as there grows.</p>
            <p>The Land disposed of as to the scite of the House, Groves, and Woods planted for Timber-trees arises to 120 Acres and a half, out of the remainder of Land which is 80 Acres, on the North-east side of the Dwelling-House, and flanking the North point of the Kitchin Garden, and about the middle distance of Land between the said point, and South-west side of the North-east Grove shall be inclosed a square Plot of Land containing 10 Acres, with a Mote or Water-course 18 foot broad.</p>
            <p>About the middle of the ground thus inclosed shall be built a Shed or low rooft House 4 square, answering the Figure of the Land inclosed, the walls or sides of the said Shed should be 7 foot high built with brick.</p>
            <p>The length of every square side must be 80 foot, and the breadth 10 foot between the walls within the House; then the 4 square sides or whole House contains 320 foot round: and the Plot of ground or Yard within the House, allowing 18 inches for the thickness of the Wall, will contain 54 foot square.</p>
            <p>Within this House we shall place 240 Conie-Hutches or Boxes, each of them containing 5 Rooms one above the other, or 5 stories high; in which Rooms must be kept 1000 breeding Doe Conies, and 100 Bucks, every one of them in a several Room; the remainder of Boxes are to be reserved to keep Weaned Rabbets. These Hutches are so well known, that I shall not describe them; but in the way of placing these Hutches within the Shed must be observed, that the back-sides stand close to the wall on the top or upper Room, and the bottom, lower part or foot to stand at least 6 inches from the said wall, and thus
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:64535:89"/>
standing sloping, the urin that falls from the Conies will pass or run sooner and cleaner away. Now these Hutches thus pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on both sides the House, and set close one to the other, will make 2 Rows round the House: The Floor of the said Cony-house should be paved with Brick or Pible-stones, and under every Hutch must stand an-earthen Pan to save the urin that cometh from them; for if it be spilt on the Floor it will taint the Conies, and do much hurt both to young and old.</p>
            <p>There must likewise be provided 4 wooden Vessels of Firkin size, each of them must stand on 4 wheels; these Tubs being filled with Bran and Grains, with a small strength may be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or drawed throughout the 4 quarters of the House twice eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day to feed the Conies, and by the use of wheels the work may be dispatched in a short time with much ease.</p>
            <p>In the middle of the Court or Yard within the Cony-house should be built a small House 3 stories high, to lay in Provision for the Conies, as Hay, Grains, Bran and Oats; also a Lodging Room for the Warrener.</p>
            <p>Now whereas Tame Conies will usually breed 7 or 8, and sometimes more Rabits at one Litter, and 8 or 9 moneths or times in one year, we shall breed but 6 moneths, and shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve or keep but 5 Rabits of every Doe, and if she bring above that number, the overplus shall be destroyed within 3 dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter she hath littered; but they shall not be cast to the dunghil as of little worth, for they will be a very good change of food for Musk or Civet Cats, or else being thrown into the Mote will feed the Fish: And if any of the Does bring not the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 5 Rabbets at one litter, then from those Does that bring above that number shall be taken so many as will make up the number of 5 for every Doe.</p>
            <p>Now if these Conies be of a large kind, and that you keep them sound, and they breed their Rabbets fat: also if you breed to kill in season, before the Field Rabbets are or can be fit to serve the Markets, then every one of these House Rabbets will yield 7 pence at 4 weeks old; for they will be twice as large,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:64535:89"/>
and much fatter than any field Rabbet: Also the latter season when the field Rabbets are spent, then every one of these house Rabbets will yield 9 or 10 pence to be sold at 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> months old. And if you give the weaned Rabbets Oats, Hay, and Water, likewise Chalk with their meat, a better Rabbet cannot be bred either for colour, taste, or wholsomness.</p>
            <p>But if any shall question the sale or vent of these Rabbets kill'd at the seasons beforementioned, I can assure him it hath been my care both to treat with Warreners and Poulterers in <hi>London</hi> about the same, and they all condescend to my Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, and also say that <hi>London</hi> Markets will take off or vent five times more in one or both seasons, than can be bred of a thousand Does. We shall in the next place give an account of the yearly Charges and Profit by keeping a thousand breeding Doe Conies and a hundred Bucks; also the breeding and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining fit for Market 5 Rabbets of every Doe, and so to breed six times in one year, the account is as followeth.</p>
            <p>One Doe breeding and bring<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng up fit for the Market five Rabbets six times in one year, that is 30 Rabbets in the whole at six pence the Rabbet; it being an indifferent price as to both seasons of killing, they come to 15 shillings yearly; then the Profit of a thousand Does, according to the same rate, amounts to 750 pound the year.</p>
            <p>There are other Profits arising from these Conies.</p>
            <p>First, the Excrement which cometh from them, with the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal of the Hay, which being well husbanded, will make special good Dung or Soil for Land, and may be worth 40 shillings the year.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Garbedge or Guts of the Rabbets sold every year, there being killed from a thousand Does thirty thousand Rabbets; the said Garbedge being cast into the Mote, the water although little above the quantity of an Acre, yet will keep and feed more Fish, especially the Carp, then 4 Acres of other wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without the same helps.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in this Mote may be kept a hundred Spruce Ducks
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64535:90"/>
with the Offal of Bran and Grains from the Conies. I have kept of the said Ducks, and they have laid each Duck 50 Eggs in 50 dayes, every day an Egg; and resting 2 or 3 weeks they have layd again; so that one Duck will lay 200 Eggs in a year; and they being better for the use of Confectioners than Hen-Eggs, will yield at <hi>London</hi> 4 shillings the hundred; then the profit of one Duck yearly is 8 shillings, and the yearly profit of a hundred Ducks amounts to 40 pound.</p>
            <p>Now for the yearly profit by Fish, we shall stock the Mote with 400 Fry or young small Carp, and at 5 years growth, the said Carp will be worth 12 pence a piece, then the 400 Carps come to 20 pound, which is 4 pound yearly gains or profit from the Mote or Water-course, containing 171 square pearch 8 foot ¼ or 36 inches.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, upon the Land inclosed by water, as aforesaid, may be fed a considerable number of Rabbets, which shall not be kept there so long as to be of strength to dig or make holes or Burrows in the earth, not living only on the Grass or Pasture, but shall have several Racks for Hay, and Troughs or Mangers for Bran and Oats made and set up in the Court Yard within the Cony-house, where there must be several holes or passage wayes made through the walls for the Rabbets to go in and out at, from their dry food, to feed, sport, and air themselves in the Grass or Pasture: And because we shall not keep a constant Stock of Rabbets on the Pasture; therefore at those several times and seasons of the year, when the Land is not stockt with Rabbets, it may be stocked with Sheep, to keep the Grass short and sweet; for Conies will not thrive in long or sower Pasture: The keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sheep is worth 3 pound yearly. This way of keeping and feeding Rabbets with Bran, Hay, and Oats will not only keep them sound, but the Land will keep ten times more Conies than the Pasture would do of it self.</p>
            <p>We shall now give you all the Accounts of Profit or Gain in one total summ, and is as followeth.</p>

            <p>I should have first set down and given an account of the Charge or Expence by keeping the foresaid Conies, Ducks, and Fish: but because it is wisdom in Man to know the end of his Journey before he set forth; also a Merchant would not venture his Ship and Goods at Sea, did he not know the Markets would yield him a profitable return; neither would the Husbandman be at charges in plowing and sowing his Land, if he did not hope for a plentiful Harvest; and most men covet to know the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and gain of their undertakings before they will be at charges or expence; therefore to please all men if possible, I have first set down the Profit, and shall now in the next place give you an account of the yearly Charges of keeping the Conies as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, and that is as followeth.</p>
            <p>As for the Charges of making the Mote, building the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, making the Hutches, or buying the first Stock of Conies, and such like, they being all as one intire Stock, which may last many years without repair; we shall not therefore charge them to an account in this place.</p>
            <p>The Inclosed Land for the Conie Warren being 10 Acres; we shall value at 20 shillings the Acre yearly Rent, which comes to 10 pound the year.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:64535:91"/>Two Maids will sufficiently tend and keep all the Conies, as making clean the several rooms in the Hutches, and feeding the Conies twice every day, and will deserve for their yearly wages each Maid 50 shillings besides their Diets.</p>
            <p>The Warrener or Man that buyes in the Provision, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Does and Bucks at the several seasons for breeding, also to sell and dispose of the Rabbets, and such like imployments, may deserve besides his Diet 10 pound yearly wages. Now these three Servants may be serviceable about other Imployments some certain time every day: we shall reckon the Diet and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of these Servants to be worth 45 pound yearly.</p>
            <p>In the next place we shall consider what Provision will be needfull for these Conies, as also the weekly Expences and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Summ.</p>
            <p>The best food for them are Oats, Bran, Hay, and Water; but because Oats and Bran are costly feeding, we shall therefore add unto them Grains, especially in breeding time; for when the Does give suck they will require the moistest food, but not any kind of Grass or Herb, for green food will not only rot them, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so make them forsake their dry meat, which is most wholsom; and instead of Grains you may give them Water in a little ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Pot made for the same use to stand in every Room one Pot, with fresh water every day.</p>
            <p>Now whereas these tame Conies breed but 6 times or months in the year, those Months they do not breed there will not be so great a quantity of food spent as when they do, because the young Rabbets after they are two weeks old will feed with their Dams, and that charge or expence of food may continue a week or two as the Markets will take them off.</p>
            <p>We shall compute the Expence of the whole Stock, old and young every week one with the other throughout the year, and that is 100 Bushels of Grains, 30 Bushels of Bran, 20 Bushels of Oats, and 15 Hundred of Hay: This is the weekly allowance which will sufficiently keep and maintain the whole Stock as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:64535:91"/>And that we may bring all the particular Charges to one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal account, we shall reckon or value the Grains at 3 pence the Bushel, Wheat Bran at 12 pence heap and thrust or double Bushel, the Oats at 16 pence the Bushel, 15 Hundred of Hay at 2 shillings the Hundred: All these summs being added, the weekly Expence for Food arises to 5 pound 11 shillings 8 pence; and the yearly Charge according to the same rate comes to 289 pound 14 shillings 8 pence. Chalk mixed with the Conies meat will keep them sound; there may be spent in one year 3 Cartload of the same, and is valued at 20 shillings the 3 load.</p>
            <p>We shall now add or bring all the several Sums into one total Sum for the whole year, not knowing of any more Charges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable or worth the mentioning in this place.</p>

            <p>Yet there is no Creature more subject to loss, for they are incident to very many Diseases, by reason of bad and unsound soyl, land, or grass which they feed on; also idle unskilful Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, so that I have known lost in one years time 15 hundred, nay sometimes 2 or 3 thousand out of the several Stocks of Sheep, as aforesaid, which have dyed of the Rot, and many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred more yearly lost by other Diseases: And because most Shepherds are very ignorant of the several Diseases, therefore come they short in the Cure. To prevent mistakes we shall here give a Catalogue of those that are most dangerous and mortal; First, there are 3 kinds of Rot in Sheep, the one is taken when they feed on Spear-wort, Penny-wort, Knot-grass, or any Weed that grows from Inundations of water. The second is a hungry Rot, and that Disease is most incident to Field Sheep or those kept on Commons. A third is the Pelt Rot, which cometh by great store of rain immediately after Sheep are new shorn. There is another cause of Rot, and that is when Sheep in their feeding lick up little white snailes. Besides these several Rots, Sheep are incident to the Staggers and Stu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:64535:92"/>
care of the Shepherd and Warrener, all these losses in both may be prevented; for in Conies there are but 3 adherent Diseases, which are Fevers, Madness, and the Rot; but they have many Enemies, as Tumblers, Lurchers, Greyhounds, Mungrels, Foxes, Polecats, Stotes, Weasels, Wild-cats, House-cats, and such like; also other Vermin, as Hauks, Buzards, Ringtails, Kites, Oules, Ravens, Crows, and many more; yet a greater than any of these is Man with all his Engins, as Guns, Bows, Snares, Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets, Hayes, Pursnets, and the like. Now considering all these, a Warrener may charge to his account of profit and loss at least the one third part of every years Breed of Rabbets; and if he save two parts of three it will sufficiently pay the Rent of the Land, and return good profit into his Purse.</p>
            <p>We should here have set down the several Receipts to Cure and prevent the Diseases in Conies, with the manner and way of keeping and feeding them; but especially designing the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of this little Plot by other ways as well as that; I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,</p>
            <p>On the South-west side of the Dwelling-house, and flanking the South Point of the Kitchen Garden, and about the middle Distance between the said Point and North-east side of the South-west Grove, just opposite to the Warren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shall be made the quantity of 10 Acres of Land or 40 Perch square of ground into a Fish-pond; this Water shall be kept in the nature of a Decoy, but not absolutely so, because it is an improper place, being among Woods, or the Wood growing so near unto it; for the best decoy Ponds are in Champion Fenn Countries.</p>
            <p>In the middle of this our Decoy Pond shall be made an Oval or round Island containing one Acre of Land, and in the middle of this Island shall be built a round house 30 foot over or 90 foot about: This House shall be one intire-Room, 20 foot high, built with heart of Oak; the Roof of the said House would be covered with the best sort of Slait: The other part of the House being built thick with Timber, then the space between the said Timber shall be made up or inclosed with strong Wyer
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:64535:93"/>
in the manner of a Bird-cage; and the use of the said Cage or Aviary is to keep all kinds of singing and whistling Birds.</p>
            <p>Through the middle of the Floor of the said House shall run a small stream of Water which may pass in and out through a leaden Pipe: This water is not only for the Birds to drink, but also to wash and bath themselves in, There must be made likewise in this Aviary several Tables and convenient places with troughs to put their several seeds and food in; also Perches or places to roost or perch on, and they must be under the roof of the said House.</p>
            <p>In 4 equal parts round the out side of the Aviary shall be built 4 Seats in the form of an Arbor or half Arbor; the length of the said Seats would be about 6 foot; both ends of two of the Seats must be planted with Holly or Holme Plants, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two Seats are to be planted with Ivy, and those Plants are to grow up and cover the top of the Seats, by closing together, and so become an Arbor.</p>
            <p>Round the Island, and about 3 foot from the water side must be planted at every 9 foot distance of land, 4 Holly or Holme Plants, and they must be set 4 square, and 18 inches one from the other. These bushes must be kept as shrubs by often cutting of them, and not suffered to grow above 4 foot high; but the 4 Plants are to grow that they may joyn close together on the top, also round the sides to the bottom or ground as one Bush, leaving only one small hole that the Ducks may go in at to lay their Eggs. This performed the bushes will make a gallant show, and are of good use to save the Decoys Eggs from Crows, Magpies, and such like Vermin.</p>
            <p>Round the outside of the Pond and Island would be planted with Reed, such as usually grow on the sides of great Rivers, or in the Fenn Countries.</p>
            <p>The Stock of decoy Ducks constantly kept in this Pond shall be about 60 pair; the Eggs and Breed of them may be worth 20 pound yearly, besides that which may be gained by other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages they bring in.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:64535:93"/>Moreover this Pond shall be stored with 2000 young Fish or F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y of Carp, Bream, Tench and Pearch; but I shall advise to put in a greater number of Carps than of all the other 3 kinds: if 100 Eels be cast in, they will not much prejudice the other Fish: There may be likewise cast in good store of Gudgeon, Loch, Dace, and Roch, which are good prey and food for the greater sort of Fish, and will make good sport, and be a profitable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation for such as delight in Angling. And because we have not feeding for these Carps as for those about the Warren, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the bottom and banks of the Pond would be paved with flot grass, which naturally grows under water; for it is a great feeder of fish. Now about five years after the Pond is stored, the Fish may be taken, and will yield to be sold, if not above 30 miles from <hi>London,</hi> 80 pound; also there may be left or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served a sufficient Stock against the next Fishing season, which may be about 5 years after.</p>
            <p>Next to be considered and presented to view is a Dove-house, which would be built in the middle of the Barn yard; this House is not to be stored or stocked with ordinary wild or house Pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but with those called Carriers; for we shall have of our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary wild Pigeons breed in the Woods, as Ring-doves, Stock-doves, Turtle Doves, and such like; but those called Carriers, the original of them came first out of <hi>Asia,</hi> although many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, are now kept in and about <hi>London</hi>; and because they are known but to few people, we shall tell you why they are so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and declare the use and profit of them.</p>
            <p>In several Towns and Harbours bordering on the Seas, and now under the Command of the Turk; to omit particulars we shall mention one for all: In <hi>Aleppo</hi> several persons keep these Pigeons in Houses built for the same purpose, and do make the same profit of them as is made by Post Horses; of these Pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there is of several Colours, as white, black, and blew, as also all these colours mixed, as black and white, blew and white, motley, dunn, and kite-colour.</p>
            <p>Such Ships as trade in those parts, when they set sail or go to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:64535:94"/>
sea, the Captain, Merchant, or any of the Company, may hire of these Pigeons one, two, or three, or as many as they may have occasion for, according to their Voyage; and in the Ship there is a Room built to keep them. Now in the Voyage at sea, if the Ship encounter an Enemy; or that by ill weather they are forced ashore on rock or sand, or spend a Mast, or have split a sail, or if any business be forgot that should or may be done, and such like, then they or either of them writing their will or mind in fine paper, provided for the same purpose, and making it up as a Letter, do tye it about the body of the Pigeon under the Wings, and turn her out of the Ship; now by nature these Birds being very strong of flight, immediately make homewards from whence they came; and he that keeps them, taking an account in his book what colour, and the number are delivered to every Ship, does often search his Dove-house, and the Letters he finds about any of them are speedily sent or delivered accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to directions.</p>
            <p>Now the reasons why we stock our Dove house with these kind of Pigeons, is, first because they have a greater and more plum round body than our English Dove-house Pigeons; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they are stronger and quicker of flight, therefore will get their food, if to be had in <hi>England</hi>; Thirdly, they are more shy and subtle, and will eschew and free themselves from Snares, Nets, and Guns.</p>
            <p>But many men object against Pigeons and say they are great devourers of Corn: Our Answer is, that in <hi>Bedfordshire, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgeshire, Northamptonshire,</hi> and many other Countries where is the greatest Flights of Pigeons, there they have the greatest Crops of Corn: Secondly Pigeons do not feed on Corn cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, except part of it be visible: And though it be the opinion of most Husbandmen for want of better Judgment, that Corn lying on the ground will take root, grow, and thrive, as that under ground; which if so, then why do most Corn Countries, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Clays. Marle, or other stiff grounds sow their seed under fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or before the Plow, covering the seed by the Plow, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:64535:94"/>
it is not only to prevent Vermin from devouring and carrying the Corn away, which is very good husbandry; but also they have experience, that if the seed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly above ground, and not well covered, although it may grow to blade, stem, and ear, yet shall not kernel or produce seed; for in great drought the Sun will not only scorch the Seed, Stem, and all above ground, but also draw up the moistness of the earth deeper than such roots can extend themselves, because the seed lying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove or very shallow under the earth, is subject to all weathers. Much rain will be hurtful by washing the fatness and good of the earth deeper into the ground than the roots will reach unto; and now by reason of the foresaid accidents the spirit of the seed is so much weakned that it cannot prosper as the other Seed.</p>
            <p>The great enemies to new sown Corn are Field Rats and Mice, and Rooks, for they will not only devour and carry away all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ground in sight, but scrape and dig after that which is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; and when the Corn appears in blade, then both Rooks, Stares, Larks, and such like, will follow the blade to the root, and so stock up and spoil many Acres; therefore when these Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min are destroyed, we shall likewise destroy our Pigeons, if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time the Judgment of their Enemies be not convinced: And whereas Rooks, Crows and P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>geons may do much hurt when Corn is ripe, at or before Harvest, yet the Charges of one Man with a Gun charged only with powder may keep a thousand Acres untill out of danger. I shall add one thing more in the behalf of Pigeons, they are not only a necessary whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some food, but ready at all times to be served in at a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Table: And the Dung that comes from them is a very rich Soil, which being sowed on Land before or immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the seed, will p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:64535:95"/>We have now disposed of 140 Acres of Land, there does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main 60 Acres: Out of the said remaining Land 40 Acres shall be made choice of for Pasture, which will make of Statute or Land measure, 40 acres a quarter 16 perch and 196 foot.</p>
            <p>This Pasture Land shall be made into 4 Inclosures, each of them containing 10 Acres and the odd measure: In these Grounds shall be kept 20 of the largest and best sort of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Milch Cows, one of the least of which shall give 2 Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons of Milk at one Meal, or 4 Gallons every day; and they shall be shifted or changed into fresh Pasture every week.</p>
            <p>The Remainder of the 60 Acres, which is 20 Acres 18 perch and 48 foot, shall be made or inclosed into 2 severals, and they shall be plowed and sowed with Corn: Each of these Fields will contain about 10 Acres and the odd measure Statute mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: and because the Land is a strong rich earth, there shall be sowed only Wheat and Pease, except some change of other seed for convenience, which Corn may be continued or sowed 6 years together, and not let the Land rest, that is two years with Wheat, the third year with Pease, the fourth with Wheat again, the fifth with Pease, and the sixth with Wheat. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the greatness or rankness of the Stuble will hinder the Plow the second seed season, you may burn it standing on the ground, or clear the Land of it otherwise. The seventh year being the year of Jubily, according to the Command of the great Husbandman, our Eternal God, the Land must rest; and in that time there may be a sufficient Stock of Soil or Dung provided to inrich the Land again: And the Land being sowed again the eighth year, may so continue from time to time many hundred years.</p>
            <p>Now although our Rules and Directions are very sound and certain, yet we doubt not but to meet with many enemies, as some there are would quarrel with the Sun for his heat and brightness, others with the Moon for being dark and cold. I have not erected or drest out this little Theatre of Nature for Disputation, but for Speculation and Contemplation; and if
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:64535:95"/>
for my sincere endeavours to satisfie curious expectation, you will but lend me your acceptance, I will take the confidence to lead you through this pleasant Land, Garden, or Paradise, and give you a view of every part thereof.</p>
            <p>At the first Entrance on the South-east side, and opposite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Dwelling-house, you may behold a convenient Gate-house, wherein dwels the Woodward: passing through this Gate you may walk between 2 Rowes of Service-trees, through the first 10 Acre Close of Cow-pasture, to the Orchard or Cherry-garden Gate; from this last Gate you shall be directed by 2 Rowes of Mulberry-trees vnto the Garden Gate: On both sides joyning unto the said Gate is to be built a brick Wall 9 foot high, which wall shall extend to the breadth of the Cherry Orchard, and so reach to the Court-yard Wall, and inclose the Garden. The Cherry Orchard is 20 Perch square, but not any of the trees to grow nearer then 18 yards of the Mulberry-trees, that there may be full view of the Dwelling House.</p>
            <p>The Apple-Orchard flanks the Cherry-Orchard and Flower-Garden on both sides, and reaches to the Court-Yard Wall: This ground is planted with the best sort of Fruit, as Apples and Pears, also Syder-Apples, as Red-streaks and others, and inclosed with a White-thorn Hedge: Round the said Fence on the out-side runs a small Brook or Water-stream 9 foot broad, which encompasses the whole scite of the House, and is stored with Trouts, Gudgeons, and others the best sort of small Fish.</p>
            <p>On the 4 Corners of the Orchard are raised 4 Mounts, each of them 15 foot high, and the way which goes to the top is round the Mount ascending; the outside of the Walks is plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with several sorts of Plum-trees, which shall be kept by pruning to grow not above 6 foot high: The Ladies gathering of these Plums may ascend to the top of the Mounts with ease and pleasure, whereby they shall be received into green Arbors planted with White-thorn, which by often cutting or clipping growes so close and thick, that neither wind, sun, nor aire will

be offensive to them: Round these Arbors in the inside are O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Seats, and Tables of Marble in the middle.</p>
            <p>Entering the Garden of Flowers, which Garden also is 20 Perch square, you may behold on the North-east side a Vine-yard or Plot of ground answering the length of that side of the Garden, planted with Vine Sets of the best sort of Grapes, that will thrive there; and that they may the better grow and ripen, not only the earth is made by soil very rich, but a Frame made of the heart of Oak Checker-work: the length of the said Frame is 20 perch, which is the length of the North-east side of the Garden, but in breadth not above 9 foot. This Frame is to stand on feet, the lower side, or the outmost legs to be not above 12 inches high from the ground, and the other or high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est side about 8 foot: The outmost or shortest legs must stand 5 foot from the Wall, and the innermost or longest about one foot. The whole Frame must stand sloping, and the upper side lean on the Wall. Now the Vine Sets are planted all along a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst and before the lower part of the Frame, and do spread and grow equally all over the Frame and not farther.</p>
            <p>On the South-west side of the Garden, and round the other Quarters, excepting where the Vines are planted, and about 2 foot distant from the Wall, is comely to behold several Trees growing with the best sorts of Wall-fruit, which by dressing or proyning are made to grow broad, and bear the same figure as if they were fastned to the wall; but to support them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shaken by winds, they have Frames made round the body, and so reach to the boles or first armes of the Tree; and about the body and armes are made great wisps of Hay, and so that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting on the Frames on all sides, they are kept from any harm by winds, as we have said before in transplanting Trees for Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. These Fruit-trees will receive the heat and reflection of the sun from the wall to ripen the fruit, better than if they were nailed thereunto; also such Trees will live ten times the age, and bear la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to many annoyances, as bark-bound, bark-bruised, or peeled, Cankers, and many other evils: and besides these Diseases, there is but one side of the Tree hath the benefit of Air and Sun; therefore they cannot long live or thrive.</p>
            <p>On the North-east and South-west corners or sides of the Garden, ranging even with the Dwelling-house, you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in each Place a hansome built House, one of them is the Master of the Gardens Study, and the other a private Retiring-place for his Lady.</p>
            <p>Opposite, and not far from the 4 Corners of the Garden will appear 4 Oval Grass-Plots handsomely kept; in the middle of each Plot a Wainscote Seat 6 foot in length, covered over with 4 several kinds of Plants, as Ever-green and Privet, Holly, Ivy, and Cypress, growing on the back side, and by proyning brought into the form of an open Arbor, and each Arbor covered over with one kind of Plants.</p>
            <p>Now between these comely green Plots there will appear to your view 4 several Knots, wherein grow all sorts of the best Flowers; and because there are as many sorts or figures of Knots as Gardners have Inventions, the Knots here made choice of, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though old figures, yet such as are comely in this Garden, and they are thus placed; the Trefoul opposite to the Crossbow, and the Oval Knot to the Fret.</p>
            <p>In the middle of the Garden is to be seen a comely Maze well framed, and planted with a Hedge of several sorts of the best kind of Berries; the said Hedge is not allowed to grow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 5 foot high; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and in the middle of this Maze doth appear a Fountain built with Marble, whose Chrystal streams are very serviceable in several Rooms of the House, being conveyed in Pipes under ground: On the top of this Fountain you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold an artificial Sun-Dyall made so plain, that the time or hour of day may be discerned by good eyes without entering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Maze.</p>
            <p>Round the Garden-wall and the Oval green Plots, the square Flower-Knots, before the Wall-fruit, and round without the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:64535:97"/>
Maze, you may walk in very comely large Walks made of fine sifted Gravel and Sand well mixed; from thence we shall lead you through the Dwelling-house into a comely Court Yard, and through that into a Common Yard, being very large and spacious; in which Yard is built several usefull Houses with Barn and Stable: This Yard is so curiously paved with large pible stones, and kept so clean and neat, that neither straw, stick, nor loose stone shall be seen to lie therein. We shall not detain you longer here, but direct you into the Garden of Herbs and Roots, not only for Food but Physick.</p>
            <p>This Plot of land lyeth behind the great Yard, and is in length from the Garden Gate to the farther end of the whole Plot 30 perch, and in breadth 20: The Fence is of VVhite-thorn, and the VVater running round, as was said before.</p>
            <p>In the middle of this great Plot, which contains two Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, is a handsome Bowling-green 60 yards square, and at each corner of the said Green is a Seat made of Oak in the form of an open Arbor, and planted at the back on both sides with Fruit-trees, such as will best cover the said Seats as an Arbor: One Seat contains on each side 3 foot, so that the whole Seat is 6 foot, and every Arbor or Seat faces towards the middle of the Green.</p>
            <p>About the middle of the South-east side of the Bowling-green, in the Kitchen Garden, but joyning to the outside of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ence, or bounds of the said Green, is built a convenient House for the Gardener to dwell or Lodge in: the said House having necessary Rooms to lay or keep this Roots, Herbs and Seed, or such like.</p>
            <p>On or at the North-west side of the Physick-garden, and near the Fence, is built a Bee-house to contain 200 Stals, Stools, or Hives of Bees. The manner and way of keeping these Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the profit arising from them is so well known, that we shall not need farther than to mention them. And in the same end or side is also built a convenient House to keep 10000 Silk-wormes; for we shall have sufficient for them from the Cabages and Mulberry-trees.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:64535:97"/>At the Entrance into this Garden on both sides within the Gate grow two Lawrels, which being made to close at the top become an Arbor, having Seats made to sit on; from thence a large Walk of sifted gravel on both sides, planted with Medler Trees, directs you to the Gardeners House, on each side of whose Door grows a Bay-tree; and if you will know the reason, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause nether Witch nor Devil, Thunder nor Lightning hurt a man in the place where that Tree grows.</p>
            <p>On both sides of the Gardens, and 6 foot distant from the Fence, you may behold a single Row of several sorts of Plum-trees made grow by cutting or proyning into several shapes or Figures, as a Hart running, Hounds hunting him; other trees of several shapes of Wild beasts. For I formerly declared, that if the work be timely begun as a Tree is young, you may bend, bow, or dress him to any shape; and yet these Plum-trees thus dressed will thrive and bear a sufficient quantity of Plums every fruitfull year; for all Trees do not bear alike every year.</p>
            <p>After you are past the Lawrel-trees, on the right hand of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Walk will appear 4 large square Plots of land, they also lying 4 square opposite to each other: In these Plots are to grow Parsnips, Carrots, Turnips, and Muskmelons, in each Plot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral; also in the middle space between the 4 Plots a small O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Grass-plot, and in the middle of the said Grass-plot shall grow a Tamarisk-tree, and at each corner of the Squares a Goos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry Bush. On the left hand of the said Gravel Walk shall likewise be 4 square Plots of the same quantity of Land bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same figure, and over against those on the right side, wherein do grow Artichokes, Cabbages, Colliflowers, and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Beans; also in the middle space between the 4 Plots a small oval Grass-plot, and in the middle of the said Grass-plot a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marisk-tree, and at each corner of the Squares a Currant-bush.</p>
            <p>The two Gardens being divided by a comely Border of the best sort of Roses, as Red, Yellow, Damask, Velvet, double Province, and the sweet Musk-Rose; both sides of the Border
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:64535:98"/>
is powdered with Strawberries of all sorts, as red, white, green, &amp;c. On the right hand of this second Garden, planted with Physical herbs, will appear to your view 4 large Oval Plots, containing the same quantity of Land as the Plots in the first or Kitchen Garden, and lying likewise in a square figure, also a small square Grass-plot in the middle space between the 4 Oval Plots, and a Tamarisk-tree in the middle of the said Grass-plot: within these Ovals do grow Saffron, Anniseed, Carroway, and Coriander-seed in each Plot a several; they being all very good flowers for Bees. Round each Oval Plot do grow 4 Barberry-bushes at an equal distance one from the other. On the left hand or side of this last Garden are to be likewise 4 Oval Plots of the same bigness, and just opposite to the last, lying also in a square figure, and a small square Grass-plot in the middle space between the 4 Oval Plots, with a Tamarisk-tree in the middle of the said small Grass-plot, and 4 Barberry-bushes growing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually round each Oval; and within these Oval Plots do grow Licorish, Asparagus, Tobacco, and French-Beans, in each Plot a several. From the middle of the North-west side of the Bowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-green to the farther end of the Physick-garden is a large Gravel Walk, where is growing on both sides a single Row of Quince-trees: At the 4 corners of the Kitchen Garden shall be g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In both these Gardens there are many Beds and Borders, wherein shall grow several Roots and Herbs, as well physical as for food; but to speak to every particular Plant would spend much time and paper; we shall only name them in an Alphabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical order, and they are as followeth.</p>

            <p>There are many Plants, Herbs, and Seed brought out of other Kingdoms, which are not here named, because it is well known to such as are studious in the Art Herbary, that those Plants and Herbs that grow in several Kingdoms are most wholsome and Medicinal to such as live in those Kingdoms; therefore we have not any Plant or Herb in our Garden but such as naturally grow in <hi>England,</hi> as best fitting with our English constitution.</p>
            <p>Now all these Plants will not grow and thrive alike in one kind of earth: as Parsnips, Carrots, and such like will require a
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:64535:99"/>
light, loose, or rich sandy earth; and Cabbage, Turnips, Beans, and such like, a rich clay or a moist rich earth. Again some Plants or Roots having long shanks, will require a deep crust of good earth, as Licorish, Parsnips, &amp;c. Others a shallow crust of good earth, as Onions, Turnips, and all sorts of round or short rooted Plants; also some Plants best thrive in a very rich earth, and to have the benefit of the Sun the whole day; others in meaner or poorer ground, and in the shade; some in moist earth, others in dry; Therefore by the skill of the Gardner several kinds of earth are to be provided, or such a composition of earth as will serve for all kinds of Plants, and so comely and orderly placed in the Beds, Borders, and Squares, and so intermingled, that one looking thereon cannot but wonder to see what Nature, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by Art, can do: And that every Country Housewife may improve her own private Garden, I have here set down these few following Observations.</p>
            <p>First in cold Countries or Earths, Plants or Seed are not to be set or sowed so soon as in hot, but alwayes observing to set moist and sow dry. Secondly, the roots of Slips set must be twined if they will abide it. Thirdly, all Herbs for Flowers should once in 5 or 6 years be renewed. Fourthly, all Herbs in Drought should be often watered with Puddle water. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, seeding spoils most Roots by drawing the heart or sap from them. Sixthly, gather all sort of Herbs for use when they are fullest of sap, tender, and green, before they blow; but when they are blown, then the flowers are best and must be gathered in their prime: If you keep the herbs and flowers all Winter, then dry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them a little in the Sun, and sew them up in brown paper, and hang them not far from the fire. Seventhly, thin setting and sowing, so the Roots stand not above one foot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, is profitable; greater herbs would have more distance: Also set and sow herbs in their time of growth, except at Mid-summer, and lay no dung to the roots of herbs, for dung not rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten or melted is too hot for trees. I shall also add for our good Housewifes Observation a few more Rules of another nature.</p>

            <p>We shall now give an account of the Land plotted out and allowed for the Scite of the House and is as followeth. The Cherry and Flower Gardens are both of them 40 pearch long and 20 pearch broad, and contain 5 Acres: The Orchard which flanks, or is planted on both sides of the said Gardens, are each of them 40 pearch long and 20 broad; they contain 10 Acres. The Physick and Kitchen Gardens are 28 pearch long and 20 broad; they both contain 3 Acres; for the Yards and Ground the Houses are built on, is allowed 2 Acres; the Total of Acres, being the Scite of the House as aforesaid is 20 Acres.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:64535:101"/>Yet there is one Plant very useful and profitable not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned among all the Plants, and that is the Hop; we shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make choice of 2 Acres of Land in a convenient place that may ly sheltered from the North, North by West, and North-east winds, and plant the same the manner and way as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>The Hop<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will not thrive either in too rich a ground, nor yet in too poor, nor in too moist or very dry, but in a middle sort of earth; therefore if the ground be over moist, then the hills must be made bigger and higher than ordinary, about 2 foot high, and of compass answerable to the heigth, will be a good size for most grounds; neither must the hills be made piked or sharp on the top, nor yet too flat, and so retain or hold any rain or wet which shall fall upon it; but you shall keep a due middle proportion convenient for the Plants and Poles. Now these hills are not to be made intirely all of one Mould, but there may be mixed with the natural earth Sope-ashes, and the earth which lyeth under Dunghils, or very old rotten Dung. These three bodies being equally mixed, the hills are to be placed in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly manner, making Allies between them about 4 foot broad; and these hills must not stand all directly behind each other, but the first Row being made, the next must be placed over against the middle distance between the first Row of hills, and so the third over against the second, and the fourth over against the middle distance of the third Row, and so forward till both the Acres be planted, that the Sun may give comfort to every Plant; and the best time to begin this Work is about <hi>October.</hi> This being performed you shall then pare or hack up all the green swarth through all the alleys between the hills about 2 or 3 inches thick, and with the said swarth so pared up, cover all the hills almost to the top, turning the green swarth next unto the earth of the hills, so as it may rot; then when the Alleys a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e thus clensed of the swarth, take good store of Fern, and lay the same of a good thickness quite through all the Alleys, and round the sides of the hills; and the said Fern having all the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:64535:101"/>
Winter to rot, will not only be a comfort to the hills, and much preserve the Plants from many evils, but also kill both grass and weeds; and being shovelled up together with the earth in the Spring, will be a good Manure to replenish the hills, and make them prosper exceedingly, also will save much charges in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding other Manure.</p>
            <p>Now the hills being thus prepared, in <hi>October</hi> next following you may open the hills in the tops, and set in every hill 4 Hop Plants, and they must be set deep in the earth and covered all over at least 3 inches thick; and if with the earth which cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Plants you mix Ox blood and lime, it will not only give great comfort and nourishment to the Plants, but defend and save the Roots from Worms, other Vermin and Weeds. In the following Spring about <hi>April,</hi> finding the small Cyons which will issue or grow from the roots of the Plants, you shall th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n set up the Poles, which would be long and streight, either of Ash, Chesnut, Withey, or Alder-wood; And in putting these Poles into the earth, there ought to be care taken that they do not bruise or hurt the Hop-roots. Secondly, the said Poles must be put a good depth in the earth that the wind do not blow them down. Thirdly your care must be to place the Poles round the hills at a good distance, that one Pole may not sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow the other, but so stand that every Plant may have benefit of the Sun. The number of Poles that every hill will take up or require must be answerable to the Cyons which grow or issue from the Plants, allowing to every Pole one or two Cyons; and if the Plants will thrive, then every hill will take up or require 4 Poles and not above. These Cyons when the hills are poled must be twined about the several Poles with the Sun, and loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tyed to the said Poles; and if the Plants put forth more Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons then the number allowed for each Pole, then the rest or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verplus must be cut off close to the Stock of the Roots; and if any Cyons do grow afterwards, they must be pulled away, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t they may not run up the Poles, Now although the Fern and Soap-Ashes formerly mentioned will by killing and destroying
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:64535:102"/>
all manner of Weeds, save much charges in weeding the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; yet if any Weeds do grow they must be carefully pulled up, especially from the Plants, or hoed, and with the earth laid up round the hills, and that the Sun may destroy the Weeds, and the earth be a comfort to the Stocks or Plants.</p>
            <p>We shall now return again into the great Yard, and view the Malt-house, wherein is built an Artificial Kiln on which to dry the Hops, Malt, or other corn with any kind of Fuel or Firing, and give no evil taste or smel either to the Hops or Malt. Here you may also see many other necessary Houses, as to Brew, Bake, the Dairy-house, and several other usefull Houses for keeping Pheasants, Partridges, and other Fowl to be spent in the Family, or sold at Markets: but time will not admit of a longer stay in this place.</p>
            <p>If you please to walk through the Court Yard, on the North east side 2 Rows of Chesnut and Walnut-trees equally mixed will direct you to the bounds of the Cony-Warren, where there will be a Draw-bridge let down by which you may pass over the water, and behold those profitable Creatures so little esteemed by most people. Round the Warren, and neer the Water are several small Hutches made of boards for the Spruce Ducks to lay their Eggs in.</p>
            <p>Passing over the Mote again, and walking through the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Cow-pasture on the North-east of the Warren, a Gate will be opened to receive you into the Grove, and being entered, a large Walk will lead you to a Fountain in the middle of the said Grove; From thence issue 4 streams of water. On both sides of this large Walk are several pleasant smaller Walks, but of a greater length, where you may chance to see many Pheasants running; and if it be the season of the year, you may delight your self with those several sorts of Nuts and Berries there growing.</p>
            <p>Walking through the second Gate, scituate at the North-east end of the large middle Walk, you will enter into the great Wood of Timber-trees, where may be seen 2 Herd of Deer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining 20 Brace of Bucks and Does, 3 Brace of Roe Deer, and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:64535:102"/>
two Brace of Harts and Hinds; all the Male Dear are gelt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept those that serve the Rut: And if you carefully look up into the Trees, you may chance to see several wild Peacocks and Turkies at perch, and on the ground a brace or two of Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es at squot: Also in this Wood is kept a lease of bastard Barbary breeding Mares and a brace of handsom Geldings for present use, and in the Stable a comely bastard Barbary Stone-horse to be a Stallion for the Mares; And if it be the season of the year, and day, you may see 50 good Swine feeding on the Mast that fall from the trees, there being a Swineherd tending on them.</p>
            <p>On the South-west side of the Dwel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing-House is also a Wood of Timber trees and a Grove inclosed, containing the same number of Plants and Trees, and the same quantity of Land planted as that on the North-east side. Between this South-west Grove and the Dwelling-house, just opposite to the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, is the great Fish-pond or Decoy: by Boat you may over into the Island, in the middle of which you may behold a state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bird-cage or Aviary full of singing and whistling Birds: round this Cage at an equal distance one from the other, are 4 Seats covered over with several Greens: There having rested your self, and afterwards walking round the Island, you may behold pleasant to your sight several Holley or Hombe Bushes kept very neat and handsom for the Decoys and other wild Ducks to lay their Eggs in, as those in the Warren made of wood for the tame Ducks.</p>
            <p>And taking Boat again you may walk into the Arable Land, and behold Gods blessing by the great increase of Corn; and returning through the Pasture Fields into the Dwelling-House, you may rest and be refreshed with such food as this pleasant Land doth afford, and being satisfied, pause with your self and consider, although this be not the Paradise we read of, yet it does much resemble the same; for what was Paradise but a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and Orchard of Trees and Herbs full of pleasure, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing there but delights; so is there here; for first here is the Nightingale, the pretty Robin-red-brest, and the little Wren,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:64535:103"/>
with all the musical Birds that both whistle and sing, with a pleasant Consort of Wind musick to usher in the Spring; and refreshing and easing those cares of which we by our offence are all made Heirs.</p>
            <p>In the Summer to furnish your Table a fat Buck will be in season, also young Peacocks, Turkies, Phesants, Partridge, and many other Fowl which are at your command, with variety of Fish and other Flesh, as Hares, Rabbets, and such like: your Orchards and Gardens will afford you several sorts of Fruit and pleasant Flowers both for colours and scent; and in the Groves and Woods most stately Trees and pleasant Walks: What shall I say, a thousand pleasant Delights are attendant in this Pleasant Land: And what is there of all these few that I have reckoned which does not please the eye, the ear, the smell, the taste, yea the other sence may also take great pleasure in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling such rare Fruit and Flowers as are presented. In the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there will come in a new supply to furnish your Delights at Table, and that is Felfares, Black-birds, Thrushes, Quail, Rayl, Woodcocks, Snipes, Wildgeese, Duck and Mallard, Widgen, and Teal, with many more: And the remainder of the Summer Stock now in season, as Turkies, Pheasant, Partridge, Hares, Conies, and such like; and a hot Pasty made of the flesh of a Barren Doe will not be out of season, neither a fat Pig and Gammon of Bacon. The Bees have laboured all the Summer to provide Hony and Wax for your Winter occasions; and the Dairy-Maids have not been idle, but provided Butter and Cheese to serve your Family all Winter and Spring, besides the Monies made at Markets. The Kitchen Garden will also fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish your Table with several sorts of Roots and Herbs, and the Physick Garden with Roots, Herbs, and Seed to preserve your health. Now the pretty Silk-worms are hard at labour, spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Silk to cloath you; and if the Gardener be an Artist, he hath provided from the Grape both Sack and Claret to chear your spirits: And in the Bowling-green you may by Exercise add unto all these pleasures by refreshing your senses keep your

body in health. But to sum up all, if you did know the yearly profit that does arise out of this pleasant land, you would find it a sufficient overweight to all your pleasures.</p>
            <p>I did intend here to set down the particular and total Charge thus to plant 200 Acres of Land, with the yearly profit that may arise from the same, as I have performed in planting a thousand Acres with Timber-trees and Underwoods: But this already swelling the bulk of my Book beyond my intentions, promise the next opportunity, when I shall have an occasion to speak of something concerning the whole Body of Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, both to do that, and also to polish these rough-hewed lines, laying down the best way of improving all kind of Earths simple and compound, rich and barren. We shall now conclude this Treatise with giving you the Vertues and Use of all Plants growing in this our Paradise: And I shall begin with the first planted, and so in order proceed.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:64535:129"/>Now for all that has been said touching the Use and Vertues of all Plants as to the cure of Mans Body being diseased, it is prudence to prevent or stop a Disease before it comes; and to perform this we are to know what a Disease is, and the first ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal cause.</p>
               <p>A Disease then is the Corruption of an Entity in some part thereof, and a disposition of its total Perishing, that is Death; therefore the Body, Mind, and Soul have their Diseases: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Diseases of the Body are various, scarce to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and oft-times mixt. A Disease added tó a Disease is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Symtome of a Disease. Thirdly, a Disease of the Body is either by solution of that which is continued, or by distemper of Humors. Fourthly, solution of that which is continued is either by a Rupture or a Wound: A Rupture is prevented by bewaring falls and violent motion; a wound is avoided by shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning those things which can cleave, cut, prick, rent, tear, bruise, or hurt any way. The cure of a wound is desperate if any vital Member be hurt, as the Heart, the Brain, the Liver, the Entrals, &amp;c. for then the vital actions are hindred, and soon after cease: Secondly, if any Member be cut off, it cannot be set on again, because the spirit hath not wherewithal to pass into the part that is severed. Fifthly, the Distempers of the Humours, and the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases that come from thence alwayes proceed from one of these six causes, either from Crudity, Inflation, Distillation, Putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Obstruction, or Inflammation: First, Crudity in the Body is Nutriment not sufficiently concocted, namely either Chyle or Blood, which comes first from the quality of Meat and Drink when they are taken too raw flegmatick and unwholsome, which the Concoctive faculty cannot well subdue: Secondly, from the quantity, when more Meat and Drink is put in than it is able to alter and assimilate; for hence undigested and not assimilated humours burthen the body like strangers, and not pertaining thereunto: Thirdly, for want of Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, when the natural heat is not stirred up, nor strengthened to perform its Office lustily in the concoction of Meats; from
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:64535:129"/>
such like Crudities divers inconveniences follow; for first, if the Crudity be in the stomach it causeth lothing of food; for so long as the first food is not digested, there can be no appetite to any other. Secondly, if there be a viscous Crudity adhering in the Ventricle, or in the Guts, being warmed, it takes spirit and is turned into worms, which gnaw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng the Bowels, stir up the evil vapours by their motion; whence also come Phantasies very hurtfu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l to the Head. Lastly, Crudity under the skin in the blood or flesh begets Paleness, and when it is collected and putrified, Scabs, Vlcers, &amp;c. Crudity is prevented by a temperate Diet, as to Food, Sleep, and daily Exercise, and cured first by violent expurgation; secondly by strong Exercise; Thirdly by the use of hot Meats and Drinks; Fourthly by comforting the Stomach with such things as heat both within and without, Seventhly Inflation is much and gross Vapours exhaling from the Crudities that are gathered together, and stretching the Members; and that either without pain, as when it causeth yexing or belching in the Ventricle, panting in the Heart, giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the Head; when being prohibited to go any further, it is carried in a round laziness and stretching in the whole Body, or else with pain, as when it causeth aches in the Bowels, straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the spirits that lie between the Fibres, and sharp or else blunt prickings in the Muscles according as it is more gross or subtle: It is cured by strong Exercise, that the Vapour being attenuated may go out at the Pores opened. Secondly by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgation of the humors by which they are generated. Eigth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Distillation is the condensation of crude vapours into the Rheum, which is the cause of many Evils; for crude vapours getting up to the head, when as by reason of the aboundance and grossness of them they cannot be expurgated by the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry passage, they become Rheum flowing several wayes, and causing divers diseases; for first, if they run aboundantly, and run at the Nose they cause the Murte or Pose. Secondly, if the Distillation fall into the Jaws it causes the Cattarrhe. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if into the Kernels of the Jaws the Quinsie. Fourthly, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:64535:130"/>
the Lungs difficulty of Breathing and the Asthma. Fifthly, if the Distillation be salt and sharp, ulcerating the Lungs, it causeth the Cough. Sixthly, which if it be done oft, and the Lungs be filled with Apostemes it causeth the Consumption; for when the ulcerous Lungs cannot with dexterity enough perform their Office of cooling the Heart, the Vital is generated more hot than it should be, which doth not cherish but feed upon the flesh and blood, and at length burns out the very Work house it self of the Blood, which is the Liver, whence for want of Blood, which is as it were the Food, follows the consumption of the whole body. Seventhly, if the Distillation flow in aboundance and gross down the Marrow of the Back, it causeth the Palsie, by hindring the Animal Spirit that it cannot be distributed by the Nerves springing from the Backbone. Eighthly, if it fill the Nerves of the Muscles only it becomes the Spasma, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsion. Ninthly, if it flow subtle, and penetrating the Nerves, it is at length gathered together in the extremities of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and there raises Pains, which in the Feet are called the Gout, in the Hands <hi>Chiragra</hi> or the hand-Gout, in any of the Joynts of the Bones <hi>Arthritica</hi> the running Gout, in the Hip it is called <hi>Ischias</hi> or the Hip-gout, or the Sciatica. Tenthly, if those kind of Runnings stay in the Head they procure divers diseases, as when they are subtle the Head-ach, too raw and and flegmatick the Lethargie, salt and cholerick the Phrensie, gross and mixt with a melancholly humour the Epilepsie or Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-sickness: When as the spirits diffused through the whole Body, making hast to relieve the spirits besieged in the Brain, make most vehement stirs, and fight till they either overcome and repel the Disease, or else faint and are extinguished: But if the gross flegmatick humours have occupied all the vessels of the Brain at once, it becomes the Apoplexie, that is a privati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all sense and motion, whence also the vital fire in the heart is soon after extinguished.</p>
               <p>All thse Diseases are both prevented, and also if they go not too far, cured: first by Exercise; secondly by Rectification of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:64535:130"/>
the Brain by good smells; thirdly by a thin hot and sulphury Air; fourthly, by thin light Meat and Drink: And if these will not prevail you have liberty to go to the Physitians.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, Obstruction is a stopping of the Bowels by thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned flegm, whence it comes to pass that they cannot execute their office; for example, when the Entrals are stopt that they cannot void, it is the Volvuli or wringing of the Guts, when the Liver is stopt the Dropsie; for the Chylus being not turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into blood, flows through the Veins and Members, and is not turned into Members, when the bladder of the Gall is stopt, the Yellow-Jaundice, when the Spleen, the Black-Jaundice; for in the first the Choler, in the other the Melancholly, when it cannot be voided diffuseth it self through the Blood; but when the Urin Pipes, or the Veins, or the Bladder are stopped, that is by reason of the breeding of Tartar, which they call the Stone, which stopping the passages by its sharpness pains the Veins and Nerves.</p>
               <p>The Cure is first by Purgations, secondly by Medicines, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating or breaking, cutting and driving out the gross humors before they are gendred or knit.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, Putrefaction is the corruption of some humors in the Body, as either of Flem or of Choler, or of Melancholly, which putrefying in or out of their Vessels produce Fevers or Ulcers.</p>
               <p>The Cure is first Expurgation of the place affected, secondly a good Diet and Daily Exercise, thirdly Motion.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, Inflammation is a burning of the Vital Spirit or of the Blood, caused by the too much motion either of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by wearying it, or of the Mind by Musing and Anger; or else by Putrefaction, or else by Obstruction; for it is known out of Physicks, that Motion doth heat even unto firing, and that by Obstruction doth by Antiperistasis exasperate the heat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded even in those things that are watery and putrid, so that at length it breaks out violently. When the blood is kindled within it becomes a Fever, when under the skin St. <hi>Anthonies</hi>

            <p>The Commodities of <hi>Shotland</hi> which the Inhabitants do for the most part Trade withal is Ling and Cod, which they take with Hooks and Lines in small Boats, called <hi>Yalls,</hi> about the bigness of <hi>Gravesend</hi> Oats; the Ling they sell for 3<hi>d.</hi> a piece, being a Ling of the largest size, and is called a <hi>Gild Ling</hi>; if smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, then we have two for one, or three for two, and so propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable. The <hi>Cod</hi> is sold for 2<hi>d.</hi> the <hi>Gild Cod,</hi> and is measured as the Ling. I bought of Fisher-men, the Inhabitants of the Island called <hi>Ounst,</hi> 11655 <hi>Gild Ling,</hi> and 834 <hi>Gild Cod,</hi> at 3<hi>d.</hi> the <hi>Gild Ling,</hi> and 2<hi>d.</hi> the <hi>Gild Cod</hi>; which Ling and Cod were taken by the said Fishermen at several times in their small Boats, and brought to my Booth, or place of abode every morning as they were caught; the said Ling and Cod being very good and Merchantable, were salted aboard the Ship that landed me, and within seven weeks after my landing, I sent her for <hi>London</hi> with the said Fish to the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> as by my Books of Account, delivered into his hands, and left with him, may appear.</p>
            <p>There is also other small Fish which the Inhabitants do catch with Angles sitting on the Rocks, and in their small Boats with Hooks and Lines in the Sounds, and between the Islands; and these small fish are very considerable, for although they cannot spend them by reason of the multitude they take, and have not industry to make use of them for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if this increase of Trade were carried through the whole Islands, it would be a great encouragement to all Merchants Trading into those parts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:64535:134"/>There were several other Merchants in the Island where I did inhabit, that bought Ling and Cod of the Fishermen, so that the quantity which I sent for <hi>England</hi> was not above the fifth part taken in that Island: with which the whole quantity of fish that was bought by other Merchants throughout the whole I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slands of <hi>Shotland</hi> being added together, would amount to a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry considerable Sum or Quantity, to the lading of many Vessels, which might be much more improved, and encrease Trading thereby, furnishing the Inhabitants with Mony and Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>In the Islands of <hi>Shotland</hi> there were Beeves and Sheep sold at a very reasonable rate; <hi>I</hi> bought for my own use, and the Vict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualing the Ship sent to <hi>London,</hi> three <hi>Oxen</hi> for 3 <hi>l.</hi> and at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time four Oxen for 5 <hi>l.</hi> which were fat, and about the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the small sort of Cattel we have in <hi>England</hi>: There were also fat Sheep sold for 2 <hi>s.</hi> and 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d. per sheep</hi>; there were also other Creatures for food, as Conies and Fowl. But desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring not to multiply words, I forbear to mention them.</p>
            <p>The Fuel or Firing in <hi>Shotland</hi> is Peat and Turf.</p>
            <p>There may be Salt-pans set up there, and good Salt made to serve all the Fishing Fleet. There are very good Shores for land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drying of Nets, and making and drying Fish.</p>
            <p>There is no Night in the North of <hi>Shotland</hi> part of two Moneths in the year, as <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July.</hi> In an Island North of <hi>Ounst,</hi> being not inhabited, but stockt with wild Cows and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, I did kill with my Birding piece ten couple of Conies in one night, shooting from a little before Sun-set to Sun-rising, and it was as light as a Cloudy Winter-day.</p>
            <p>I do not remember any Frost or Snow in <hi>Shotland</hi>; if any, it was not of long continuance; the coldest weather is by reason of great Winds in the Winter-quarter, the wind blowing so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent, that no ship dare look on the North-Coast; so that the people of those Islands have little commerce with other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in that Quarter. I can speak by experience, being blown down flat to the ground by the violence of the wind, was forced
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:64535:135"/>
to creep on my hands and knees to the next wall, and going by the wall got into an house, or else must have stayed by the wall till the violence of the Wind were over. Sometimes it lasteth half a day, and sometimes more.</p>
            <p>There are several Towns in <hi>Shotland,</hi> so called, being about eight or ten houses together, where they plow and sow corn, as Oates, which is their chiefest Bread; and if my memory do not much deceive me, there was good Barley growing in my time. But the Land might be much improved if the inhabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants were industrious; they are like unto the idle <hi>Irish,</hi> not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving any thing either by Sea or Land, spending that in the Winter which they get in Summer; although their Winter might be very profitable unto them, if they were laborious and industrious, as the <hi>Hollanders</hi> are.</p>
            <p>The Goods and Commodities that are vendible in <hi>Shotland</hi> are Hooks and Lines for the taking of Ling and Cod, Nets for the taking of Herring, Strong-Beer, Bisket, Wheaten Meal, Salt, Pease, Fruits of all sorts, Strong-Water, Monmouth-Caps, and many other particulars, which is not needful at this time to mention.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of the Island of <hi>Ounst</hi> usually have a Bark that they Trade with to <hi>Norway,</hi> where they may buy Timber for Houses ready framed, also Deal-Boards, Tar, Ships, Barks, and Boats of all sorts, and other necessaries for their use.</p>
            <p>With their small Fishing-Boats, called <hi>Yalls,</hi> they will Row into the Main about two or three Leagues, more or less, where the Banks are that they lay their Hook and Lines for Ling and Cod; in one of these Boats Rowing with two men, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times four according to the largeness of the Boat, they do usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally bring to Shore every morning that they go to Sea, about fifty or sixty Ling and Cod.</p>
            <p>There are many Barrels of Herrings taken by the Inhabitants, with their small Boats, in the Sounds, and at Sea not far from Land, which are the gleanings of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Busses; for the Busses driving at Sea, break the Skull or Shole of Herrings, and
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:64535:135"/>
then the Herrings flee near the Shore, and through the Sounds, where these small Boats, with those Nets they have, take them. But, if they had better Tackling and Boats, they might take five hundred Barrels for one, which would much enrich the <hi>Islands,</hi> and by encreasing of Trade would augment His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Revenue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> was an eye-witness of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Busses Fishing for Herring on the coast of <hi>Shotland,</hi> not far from <hi>Ounst,</hi> one of the Northermost <hi>Islands</hi>; demanding the number of them, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by several persons of quality, that the Fleet consisted of 1500 Sail, and that there were about 20 Wafters, as they call'd them, which were Ships carrying about 30 Guns a piece, being the Convoys of the Fleet of Busses; which said Busses were of the burden of about 80 Tun.</p>
            <p>There were also a small Fleet of Dogger-boats, which were of the burden of 60 Tun and upward, which did fish only with Hooks and Lines for Ling and Cod. Many of these Boats and Busses came into several Havens or Sounds, to fit and trim themselves. One thing was observable, that within 8 or ten dayes after the Dogger-Boats went to Sea, they came into the Sound again so full laden as they could swim. The certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Dogger-Boats <hi>I</hi> could not learn, but the general report was about 400.</p>
            <p>The Composition of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> as <hi>I</hi> was informed after my coming into <hi>England,</hi> was an Annual Rent of 100000<hi>l.</hi> and 100000 <hi>l.</hi> in hand; and never having been paid or brought into the Exchequer, as <hi>I</hi> could hear of, there is in Arreara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges above 2500000 <hi>l.</hi> an acceptable Sum, and which would come very happily for the present occasions of His Majesty.</p>
            <p>As for the Charges in Building, Rigging, and setting forth the Busses to Sea, with Nets and other Materials for the Fishing, as also Dogger-Boats for Ling and Cod, <hi>I</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to several Books in Print, as <hi>The Royal Herring-Buss Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>; and, <hi>A Narative of the Royal Fishing,</hi> both set forth by Mr. <hi>Simon Smith,</hi> who is well experienced in those Affairs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:64535:136"/>If God would please to put it into the heart of our Gracious King and his Subjects to set out such a Fleet of Busses, as before mentioned, for the Fishing-Trade, being in our own Seas, and on our own ground; and that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and all Strangers may be discharged from Fishing in those Seas; and the <hi>Hamburgers, Breamers,</hi> and <hi>Lubeckers,</hi> and all Strangers, from Trading in the Islands of <hi>Orkney</hi> and <hi>Shotland,</hi> and that onely the Subjects of the three Kingdoms may have the Trading and Fishing, it would make our King one of the greatest Monarchs in the World, for Riches and Glory, and the Three Kingdoms the happiest peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Christendom, and there would not be one wanting Bread; but the hearts of the Subjects would be listed up with Praises to God and our King.</p>
            <p>For it is well known, that Trading is the life of all the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table World, and therefore much more of these Three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, which are but Islands, and so populous, that we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to devour one the other; and if Trading be not encreased and maintained amongst us, we shall in a short time be the most despicable People in the World, and the derision of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Having in thirty years experience in Travelling <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and other parts, observed, That without Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding no Nation can subfist, which I humbly conceive I shall be able to make good against all opposers thereof, which are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to your Sacred Majesty, and these three Kingdoms: And that if there be not an encrease of Trade powerfully carried on, we are an undone People, as I shall make more fully appear by my ensuing Discourse.</p>
            <p>Now it is well known to all, who are not quite ignorant of the course of Trade and Merchandise, that the Traffick of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> hath been engrossed into the hands, and carried on all along by the <hi>Venetians, Genoese, Portugalls, Easterlings, Hollanders,</hi> and <hi>English</hi>; all which I shall briefly run through, and shew how the failure and decay of One, was the original rise to Another, till the whole at present is divided between the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and us.</p>

            <p>Hence also that State, at first confined to a few scattered Islands, on which by degrees they built their City, whither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they onely fled for security, came to encrease and grow to that heighth in which now it is, nay greater in all probability; for
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:64535:137"/>
by the decaying of Trade, their Power and Dominion hath sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly decayed. By the greatness of their Trade they enlarged their Jurisdiction, both upon the <hi>Levant</hi> Seas, and very high in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Main-Land, in <hi>Lombardy, Graecia,</hi> on the Dukedom of <hi>Milan</hi>; conquered and purchased many considerable Islands in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> as <hi>Candy, Zant, Cyprus,</hi> and other places which lay convenient, both for strength and security of the trade and Navigation of that Republick.</p>
            <p>It would be tedious for me to recount how many Colonies they have dispersed over the World, and that fear and jealousie other Kings and Empero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eginning, onely by the extent of its trade, as its neighbour <hi>Rome</hi> enjoyed it by strength of Arms.</p>
            <p>After the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Genoese,</hi> the <hi>Easterlings</hi> or <hi>Hance-Towns</hi> were Master of the trade and Commodities transported from <hi>Moscovy, Poland, Germany, Sweden, Prussia, Denmark,</hi> &amp;c. and with them, by their abundance of Shipping, served <hi>England, France, Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countrie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Even here in <hi>England</hi> they had very great priviledges, mighty Indulgencies; and out of that necessity we thought we had of them, finding by them the speediest vent for our Commodities, we embraced them into our bosom, so that by degrees they began to be very potent upon the Northern Seas, and upon every occ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:64535:137"/>
and <hi>Normans</hi> invaded <hi>England</hi>; and the <hi>Hance-Towns</hi> were grown formidable both to <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> But as their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding decayed, so did also their Strength; and their Shipping be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wasted, they have undergone the same necessity that others, once famous Cities of Mart, have done, and have utterly lost all their Power and Strength at Sea.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Portugals</hi> discovering the way to the Indies by the <hi>Cape of good Hope,</hi> quickly became Engrossers of the whole Trade thither, and by the same stratagem and device undermined at once the <hi>Venetian</hi> and all the <hi>Hance-Towns,</hi> whereupon encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with the strength of <hi>Spain,</hi> they made themselves the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of all round about them, and a very rich Nation and People within it self.</p>
            <p>This was the first rise of the <hi>Portugals,</hi> who lying so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiously for Navigation, and a no less industrious than a very cautelous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eople in the management of their affairs, proceeded so far, that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of blessed memory jealous of them, fearing lest <hi>Spain</hi> should joyn with them, and of their future greatness, continually encreasing by reason of its Traffick into the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West-Indies,</hi> for the security of her Self, and safety of all her good Subjects, endeavoured to make her self equal in strength, and counterpoise them, if possible, by the enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Trade of <hi>Great-Britain</hi>; and this she prosecuted with so much vigour, and so successfully, that in a little space <hi>England</hi> had as great a Trade and Power by Sea, as either the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or any Principality of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before her time, in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, our own Merchants discovered the Trade into <hi>Muscovy</hi> by the way of <hi>St. Nicholas,</hi> ever since which time, in our own Shipping we have thence transported home all the Commodies of that large and vast Country, formerly brought in by the <hi>Hance-Towns</hi>; their Agents and Merchants.</p>
            <p>And whereas a great part of those same Commodities, as <hi>Cavear, Tallow, Hides; &amp;c.</hi> are not vendible in <hi>England,</hi> and being bought must be again sold or exchanged, Need and Use
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:64535:138"/>
hath found a better Vent for them in <hi>Italy,</hi> and other parts of the <hi>Levant,</hi> whereupon first began our Trade there; a Trade, which though it at first appeared very small and inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, increased in a few years to that height of Improvement, that within 90 or 100 years, we have worn out the <hi>Venetians</hi> out of all that mighty Trade they carried from those parts, or in <hi>Turky,</hi> and all over Christendom.</p>
            <p>So that by this you easily see how Trade hath flourished and decayed in <hi>Genoa, Venice,</hi> the <hi>Hance-Towns,</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> the whole being now fallen Betwixt Us and the <hi>Hollander,</hi> either striving who shall use means most effectual for advancing the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Trade of its Country; and though the <hi>Hollander</hi> hath by Art and Industry better improved his Interest, yet that wherein his Interest most lies may obviously appear, and wherein, in that very particular, we may, if we please, go before them, I shall thus endeavour to demonstrate.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> have not at present, neither ever had any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means to rise to this greatness of Wealth and Trade, but by betaking themselves to Fishing, being a People of constant La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and unwearied Industry; a multitude in a Spot of Land, which doth not afford them any Commodities sufficient to be the ground even of a mean Trade.</p>
            <p>They first began, and all along have drove this Trade of Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being their Original of all Trade upon our Coast, and the Coast of <hi>Scotland,</hi> on which they employ thousands of poor people besides others of a better Rank, making some Mariners and Fishermen, others they keep at work about the making and mending of Nets; others they employ as Merchants about the Transportation or Exchanging of their Fish for other Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. So that in all <hi>Holland</hi> you shall scarce see one Beggar, there being so many thousand things, or particular Trades or Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments belonging to the Fishing Trade, out of which they may find a livelyhood.</p>
            <p>They employ also hereby great store of Ships, and in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious management hereof, make us in <hi>England</hi> at what rate they please buy our own Fish.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:64535:138"/>The great quantity of Herrings every year they take, they transport to <hi>Dantzick, Melvin, Quinbrough, Leghorn,</hi> and other parts; and with the Returns they make of them, buy Corn, Hem, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Fish, and the Fishing-Trade being the only Stock upon which they continually live and spend, putting off most there where they find the best Rates; and this hath encreased their Shipping and Wealth, that now they have lengthned their Power all over the World, and in most Countries have a considerable Stock. And this growing and encreasing of theirs hath been within the space of 70 or 80 years, and yet they are not come to their heighth; for every day they glory in some new addition to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ir Sway. And if care be not taken of this their growth, they will within few years not only be Master of our Seas but of our Trades too.</p>
            <p>His Majesty hath been graciously pleased ta take this into his Princely consideration, and if it be seconded with the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent management of those Commissioners he hoth already im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the carrying it on, I dare be bold to say the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> are at their Meridian.</p>
            <p>For first of all, <hi>England</hi> is not inferior to the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> nay, we are before them in all the advantages both of Art and N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ture.</p>
            <p>The scituation of our Country is such, that for the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all kind of Marts the World hath not the like, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing seated between the North and South, so that it is fixed, as it we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, by Art and Nature, the fittest Staple for both Northern and Southern Commodities.</p>
            <p>Secondly, our Ports and Harbours are fairer and safer, having good Anchoring, and more in number throughout the three Kingdoms, than any Country in Christendom can boast of.</p>
            <p>And then thirdly, which exceedeth, we have valuable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:64535:139"/>
as to the quantity and quality of them, such as are the inriching of all those that trade with them.</p>
            <p>So that if we are not our own Enemies, and will be but a little industrious, one quarter of that will serve and be enough in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which is but necessary and scarce sufficient in <hi>Holland</hi>; adding thereto providence for the imploying our own Shipping, and not any Forreigners, we shall within few years have the greatest power at Sea, and make our selves Master of all Trades; and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> a Servant to that Wealth and Power, of which at present he is the sole M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ster.</p>
            <p>But for the quicker advancement of so great and noble a Work, there is necessary to be a Protection and Favour of his Majesty to all manner of Trades, so that they be not carried on by Strangers, and acted by them, as at present it is in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the City of <hi>London,</hi> there being thousands of them up and down the Suburbs, <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> and others, who live as it were upon the ruines of the poor free-born Citizens, vending any unmerchandable Ware, and at lower Rates than any other honest Tradesman can. And this I humbly conceive is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why Trading hath been so bad and dead in this great City for these late years.</p>
            <p>But the prudence of his Majesty is such, and under his pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous Reign all things so readily begin to run in their old Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, that we doubt not but in a little time Trading and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize will do so too, and not be any longer the burden of the Land for the lack of it, but of the Sea in bringing it hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>After men comes money, and without this sure Foundation, we shall never be able to make any Superstructure to stand.</p>
            <p>There must be a Stock of Shipping, Money and Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; for Commodies in Traffick will bring in more Mony, and Mony commands all Commodities, and to attempt this without both, or at le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st one of these two, is like a Soldier going to Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel without his Offensive and Defensive Weapons; with the one we offend all our Enemies, the Engrossers of our Trade, and
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:64535:139"/>
with the other we defend our selves against their most powerful assaults.</p>
            <p>In antient times, Merchants and Tradesmen were very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to provide and lay up a Stock of Money for the building of Ships, and buying of Commodities to Trade with. But in these latter years, as within 40 or 50 years, they have disbursed much mony in purchasing Land, and building stately Houses, minding pleasure more than profit, and have neglected Trade, to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing of many of them, and that great cause of the decaying of Trade.</p>
            <p>Therefore to preserve and uphold Trade, I humbly offer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Majesties consideration, and His Honorable Council, that all Merchants and Tradesmen within the Three Kingdoms may be restrained from purchasing Land above the yearly value in rent of pounds.</p>
            <p>This being effected, and the Fishing-Trade carried on, will within few years make the greatest Bank of Mony, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Trade in the Three Kingdoms, to be equal, if not greater, than any Trade or Bank of Mony in the World.</p>
            <p>For hereby great and vast Sums of Mony, which are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed in continual Purchases, will be expended only in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Trade and Traffick in general; and the best security for this Mony will be a settled Bank, which all will of necessity use.</p>
            <p>Having not read any of those Books which are in Print con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Fishing-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rade, but referring to several Books that I heard of, and not knowing the number of Busses allotted or appointed to be bought or built, neither how they shall be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed of as to their Ports or Harbours; therefore I make bold to offer my judgement.</p>
            <p>That a certain number of Busses be bought or built, as also Dogger-boats; the number of Busses to consist of 1000 or 1500, or thereabouts; for that some years 15000 may as soon catch their Lading as 500, and therefore more considerable as to the charges of the three Kingdoms; for a small number of Busses will not do the work.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:64535:140"/>The Dogger-boats which Fish only for Ling and Cod, would consist of 400, or thereabouts.</p>
            <p>These Busses and Dogger-boats being fitted for Sea to proceed in their Fishing, that then they be sent or appointed to several Ports or Harbours of the Three Kingdoms, that lie most conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for the Fishing.</p>
            <p>And that the Counties or Shires that these Ports do belong to, be enjoyned to keep the same number of Busses and Boats perpetually well rigged and furnished to Sea for the Fishing, as was delivered to them.</p>
            <p>And if by reason that those Counties, which have the most and best Harbours, and that lie most convenient for the Fishing-Trade, will bear the greatest burden, by reason the greatest num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Busses will be sent to these Ports.</p>
            <p>Then thirdly, I humbly offer, that the Undertakers of the said Counties have allowance out of the main Stock or Bank of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny proportionable to their Charges.</p>
            <p>And I do further humbly offer unto consideration, that there be a Corporation made of all the Adventurers for the Fishing-Trade, and that Merchants and Tradesmen be admitted into this Corporation.</p>
            <p>And that this Corporation be armed with large Priviledges, and ample Immunities, for the Transportation of the said Fish.</p>
            <p>I might also have told you of the Pilchard-Fishing, and for Ling and Cod on the West and North-West of <hi>England,</hi> and that great Pilchard-Fishing, and Fishing for Cod on the West Coast of <hi>Ireland,</hi> frequented by those of <hi>Biscay, Galicia,</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi>; but they are so well known that I forbear to mention them.</p>
            <p>The Islands that belong to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and lye on the North, North-West, and West of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which are useful for the Fishing-Trade, are in number 94.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is credibly reported, that above 220 Fisher-Towns are decayed and reduced to extreme poverty, for want
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:64535:140"/>
of Favour, Succour, and Protection: On the contrary, by dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent endeavouring to make use of so great a blessing, as is offered unto us by the Seas, we might in a short time repair those decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Towns, and add both Honour, Strength, and Riches to our King and Country.</p>
            <p>The Premises being taken into serious consideration, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth much to the ignominy and shame of our Nation, that God and Nature offering us so great a Treasure, even at our own doors, we do notwithstanding neglect the benefit thereof.</p>
            <p>By the foregoing discourse of Planting and Fishing my great design will easily appear to all, to have been chiefly the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of Trade, for the improvement of which no place in the habitable World lies more convenient and better situated than this Isle, though no People seem more averse, some out of neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and listlesness, others wilfully ignorant: To do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what lies in me to awaken the industry of the first, and condemn the froward peevishness of the other, I could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Subject without giving the following Account of some Observations in order hereto, collected out of a small Treatise of Sir <hi>John Burrows,</hi> printed in the Year 1633.</p>
            <p>THe <hi>Hollanders</hi> by reason of those multitude of Ships and Mariners, they have extended their Trade to all parts of the World, exporting for the most part in all their Voyages our Herring and other Fish, for the maintenance of the same in exchange whereof they return the several Commodies of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries.</p>
            <p>From the Southern parts, as <hi>France, Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> for our Herrings they return Oiles, Wines, Prunes, Honey, Wools, and store of Coin in specie.</p>
            <p>From the <hi>Streights,</hi> Velvets, Sattins, and all sorts of Silkes, Alomes, Currans, Oyles, and all Grocery ware, with much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
            <p>From the East-Countreys, for our Herrings, and other French
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:64535:141"/>
and Italian Commodities before returned, they bring home Corne, Wax, Flax, Hemp, Pitch, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arr, Soap-Ashes, Iron, Copper, Steel, Clap-boards, Timber, Deal-board, Dollers, and <hi>Hungaria</hi> Gilders.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Germany,</hi> for Herrings, and other salt-Fish; Iron, Steel, Glass, Milstones, Rhenish-Wines, Silkes, Velvets, Rashes, Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, Baratees, and such like Frankford Commodities, with store of Rixdollers.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Brabant</hi> they return for the most part ready Money, with some Tapestries, yea, some of our Herring are carried as farr as <hi>Brasile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, to carry on this great Trade, they have 700 Strand-boates, 400 Euars, and 400 Sullits, Drivers, and Todboates, wherewith the Hollanders fish upon their own Coasts, every one of those imploying another ship to fetch salt, and carry their Fish into other Countreys, being in all 3000 sail, also they have 100 Doger-boates of about 150 Tuns a piece, also 700 Pincks and Well-boates, from 60 to 100 Tun a piece, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

fishing upon their own shores) have at least 6800 ships on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintained by the seas of <hi>Great Britain</hi>; by which meanes principally <hi>Holland</hi> being not so big as one of our shires in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> have encreased the number of their shipping to at least 10000 sail; being more then are in <hi>England, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Denmark, Poland, Sweden</hi> and <hi>Russia.</hi>

            <p>By reason of those Multitude of ships they cannot imploy less then 200000 Mariners and Fishers, out of which they daily furnish their longer Voyages to all parts of the World; for, by this meanes they are not onely enabled to brook the seas, and to know the use of the Tackles and Compass, but are likewise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the Principles of Navigation and Pilotage.</p>
            <p>Moreover, How mighty the Publick Revenue and Customes of the Hollanders are encreased by their Fishing, may appear, in that above thirty years since, over and above the Customes of other Merchandise, Excises, Licences, W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We are likewise to know, That great part of their Fish is sold in other Countries for ready Money, for which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly export of the finest Gold and silver, and coming home recoyne it of a baser allay under their own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Also the gain made by private men must of necessity be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great, as by observing the particulars following will plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

appear. During the Wars between the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> before the last Truce, <hi>Dunkirke,</hi> by taking, spoiling, and burning the Busses of <hi>Holland,</hi> and setting great Ransome upon their Fishermen, enforced them to compound for great Sums, that they might Fish quietly for one year; Whereupon, the next year after, the Fishermen agreed amongst themselves to pay a Dollar upon every Last of Herrings, towards the maintenance of certain Ships of Warr, to Waft and secure them in their Fishing, by reason whereof there was a Record kept of the several Lasts of Herrings taken that year; and, it appeared thereby, that in one half year there were taken 300000 Lasts of Herrings, which at 12 pound the Last amounteth to 3600000, and at 16 or 20 pound the Last they are ordinarily sold, then transported into other Countreys, it cometh between both Prises at least to 5000000 of Pounds: Whereunto, if we add the Herrings taken by other Nations, together with the Codd, Ling, Hake, and the Fish taken by the <hi>Hollanders</hi>; and other our Neighbours upon the <hi>Brittish</hi> Coast all the year long, the Total will evidently arise to be above 10000000 of pounds yearly, or every year.</p>
            <p>And, to Conclude, such is the Clear and Indubitable Right of our Soveraign Lord the KING to the Superiority of the <hi>Brittish</hi> Seas, that no Man can produce Clearer Evidence for any part of his Estate: And, as those <hi>Seas</hi> (under God) are the Principal Means of our Wealth and safety, so it doth much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern all his true subjects, who are bound by the Law of Grace and Nature, with Heart and Hand to preserve and maintain the same with the Hazard of their L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
